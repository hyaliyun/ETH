Early life and education Nina Bari was born in Russia on 19 November 1901, the daughter of Olga and Karl Adolfovich Bari, a physician. In 1918, she became one of the first women to be accepted to the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the prestigious Moscow State University. She graduated in 1921‚Äîjust three years after entering the university. After graduation, Bari began her teaching career. She lectured at the Moscow Forestry Institute, the Moscow Polytechnic Institute, and the Sverdlov Communist Institute. Bari applied for and received the only paid research fellowship awarded by the newly created Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. As a student, Bari was drawn to an elite group nicknamed the Luzitania‚Äîan informal academic and social organization. She studied trigonometric series and functions under the tutelage of Nikolai Luzin, becoming one of his star students. She presented the main result of her research to the Moscow Mathematical Society in 1922‚Äîthe first woman to address the society. In 1926, Bari completed her doctoral work on the topic of trigonometric expansions, winning the Glavnauk Prize for her thesis work. In 1927, Bari took advantage of an opportunity to study in Paris at the Sorbonne and the College de France. She then attended the Polish Mathematical Congress in Lw√≥w, Poland; a Rockefeller grant enabled her to return to Paris to continue her studies. Bari's decision to travel may have been influenced by the disintegration of the Luzitanians. Luzin's irascible, demanding personality had alienated many of the mathematicians who had gathered around him. By 1930, all traces of the Luzitania movement had vanished, and Luzin left Moscow State for the Academy of Science's Steklov Institute of Mathematics. In 1932, she became a professor at Moscow State University and in 1935 was awarded the title of Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, a more prestigious research degree than traditional Ph.D. By this time, she had completed foundational work on trigonometric series.  Career and later life  She was a close collaborator with Dmitrii Menshov on a number of research projects. She and Menshov took charge of function theory work at Moscow State during the 1940s. In 1952, she published an important piece on primitive functions, and trigonometric series and their almost everywhere convergence. Bari also posted works at the 1956 Third All- Union Congress in Moscow and the 1958 International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh. Mathematics was the center of Bari's intellectual life, but she enjoyed literature and the arts. She was also a mountain hiking enthusiast and tackled the Caucasus, Altai, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges in Russia. Bari's interest in mountain hiking was inspired by her husband, Viktor Vladimirovich Nemytskii, a Soviet mathematician, Moscow State professor and an avid mountain explorer. There is no documentation of their marriage available, but contemporaries believe the two married later in life. Bari's last work‚Äîher 55th publication‚Äîwas a 900-page monograph on the state of the art of trigonometric series theory, which is recognized as a standard reference work for those specializing in function and trigonometric series theory. Death On 15 July 1961, Bari was killed when she fell in front of an oncoming metro train in Moscow.

The term literally means \\"buzzer\\" from the root word lesit meaning to buzz or whizz, as an insect does. Belief in the pelesit traces back to Malay animismAsian Horror Encyclopedia By Laurence C. Bush before the introduction of monotheism. Generally speaking, a pelesit can only be owned by a woman,Hantu hantu By James Noel McHugh and were said to have been prevalent in Kedah. The male equivalent is another hereditary spirit, the bajang. Due to the similarity, the two are sometimes confused in folklore. Two rituals exist for acquiring a pelesit, both of which involve recitation of the correct incantations, and biting off the tongue of a dead child. This tongue, if kept properly with the appropriate rituals, is what becomes the pelesit. Pelesit attack their victims by entering the person's mouth tail-first. A person afflicted by the pelesit will insanely rave about cats. By itself, the pelesit does nothing else. However, it is often the pet of another familiar spirit, the polong. If a pelesit enters a person's body and chirps, it is calling for the polong, which can make the victim go insane or unconscious. A shaman (bomoh or dukun) cures the victim by using a specific incantation and then asking them to reveal their \\"mother\\", meaning the pelesit's owner. The victim replies in a high-pitched voice, after which the shaman attempts to make the owner recall it. When the pelesit is not in use, its owner keeps it in a bottle and regularly feeds it either with turmeric rice or blood pricked from the ring fingerPublications, Volume 50 Folklore Society (Great Britain) 1902 - Folklore (known in Malay as the \\"ghost finger\\"). If the owner wishes to dispose of the pelesit, the bottle is buried.

Deforestation and increased road-building in the Amazon Rainforest are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource extraction and further threats to biodiversity. Roadless area conservation is a conservation policy limiting road construction and the resulting environmental impact on designated areas of public land. In the United States, roadless area conservation has centered on U.S. Forest Service areas known as inventoried roadless areas. The most significant effort to support the conservation of these efforts was the Forest Service 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule). Concept Access roads provide convenient access for industry as well as for a variety of recreational activities, such as sightseeing, fishing, hunting, and off-roading. However, these activities can cause erosion, pollution, species loss,BLM restricts off-road travel on southern Utah badlands and loss of aesthetic appeal. In addition, the building of roads can lead to further development of \\"splinter roads\\" that take off from them, and the encroachment of human settlement and development in sensitive areas. In the United States, roadless areas make up 58.5 million acres (237,000 km¬≤), or about 30%, of National Forest lands in 38 states and Puerto Rico. These areas provide critical habitat for more than 1,600 threatened, endangered, or sensitive plant and animal species.National Forest Roadless Areas, The Wilderness Society (United States) Roadless rules are also seen as a way to save taxpayers money. America‚Äôs National Forests are currently covered with of roads, enough to encircle the earth 15 times. A $4.5-billion maintenance backlog exists on National Forest roads, according to the agency's own estimates.USFS Budget Justification 2006 One example of roadless area conservation is Alaska's Denali National Park, which is prized for its expansive roadless area. There is but one access road into the park; only official vehicles are permitted after .Denali National Park and Preserve Denali Park Road Open to Mile 30 nps.gov Political conflict in the U.S. Roadless area conservation is not without criticism--especially from mining and lumber industry officials, as well as from politicians, Libertarian and Federalist political groups, and ORV enthusiasts. On January 12, 2001, after nearly three years of analysis, the U.S. Forest Service adopted the Roadless Area Conservation Rule to conserve 58.5 million acres (237,000 km¬≤) of pristine National Forests and Grasslands from most logging and road construction.National Forest Roadless Areas When he entered office, the U.S. President at that time George W. Bush modified these regulations to allow a more autonomous approach, wherein state governments would be permitted to designate their own roadless areas. On September 20, 2006, U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte ruled against the Bush Administration's plan to reverse the Clinton-era regulations, saying that the Bush plan \\"established a new regime in which management of roadless areas within the national forests would, for the first time, vary not just forest by forest but state by state. This new approach raises a substantial question about the rule's potential effect on the environment.\\"Judge Axes Bush Reversal of Roadless Rule On November 29, 2006, Judge Laporte issued an order to ban road construction on 327 oil and gas leases issued by the Bush administration since January 2001, most of them in Colorado, Utah, and North Dakota--areas that were already protected before the Bush Administration's reversal of the 2001 law.U.S. Court Bans Oil and Gas Roads on Roadless National Forests On May 28, 2009, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack issued a directive giving the Secretary of Agriculture final authority on most road development and timber activity in National Forests, for a period of one year. In 2011, a federal appeals court in Denver, Colorado upheld the government‚Äôs authority to prohibit Western states from building roads on public land. The unanimous ruling, issued by a three-judge panel, said a lower court had erred in finding for the State of Wyoming, the plaintiff in the case, and ordered that the rule be put into force nationally. Wyoming had argued that preventing road construction into or on national forests or other lands is a de facto wilderness designation, something that only Congress can do, and that the Forest Service had exceeded its own authority in trying to put the system into effect. \\"The Forest Service did not usurp Congressional authority because the roadless rule did not establish de facto wilderness,\\" the court said in a decision written by Judge Jerome A. Holmes, who was nominated to the court by President George W. Bush. The roadless rule is the law of the land after surviving its final legal challenge on March 25, 2013, when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia rejected the state of Alaska‚Äôs challenge that, while aimed at the Tongass National Forest, would have nullified the national rule. The Alaska case was the final litigation challenging the rule nationwide. The Court held that no further challenges are allowed, because the statute of limitations has run out. In literature A notable American proponent of roadless wilderness areas was writer Edward Abbey in his book Desert Solitaire. In his essay Industrial Tourism and the National Parks, Abbey describes road construction as \\"unnecessary or destructive development\\" and the loss of wilderness as a consequence of what he called industrial tourism, where once-secluded natural areas become popularized and degraded.POLEMIC: INDUSTRIAL TOURISM AND THE NATIONAL PARKS See also *Inventoried roadless area References External links * U.S. Department of Agriculture site on roadless area conservation * U.S. Forest Service Roadless Area Conservation Maps * The Wilderness Society -- National Forest Roadless Areas * Roadlessland -- Interactive maps of all U.S. roadless areas, with photos Category:Nature conservation in the United States Category:United States Forest Service ","title":"Roadless area conservation"},{"id":"7097457","text":"Ergisch is a municipality in the district of Leuk in the canton of Valais in Switzerland.

It was a vital source of weapons and supplies for the war effort, and the terminus of five railroads. The Union made many attempts to invade Richmond. In the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, General George McClellan moved up the James River, almost to the suburbs of the city, but was beaten back by Robert E. Lee in the Seven Days Battles. In 1864-5, General U.S. Grant laid siege to nearby Petersburg. By April 1865, the Confederate government realized the siege was almost over and abandoned the city lest they be captured. The retreating Confederates chose to burn military supplies rather than let them fall into Union hands; the resulting fire destroyed much of central Richmond. Strategic and symbolic significance Virginia State Capitol, used as the Confederate Capitol. To the left is the Customs House, used by the Confederate Department of the Treasury and the offices of the President and Vice-President. In the 1860 United States Census, Richmond was the 25th largest urban area in the United States, with a population of 37,910.By comparison, the population of Washington, D.C. was 61,122 in the 1860 census The city had been the capital of Virginia since 1780, and became the third largest city in the Confederacy. Capital of the Confederacy The Confederate States of America was formed in early 1861 from the first states to secede from the Union. Montgomery, Alabama, was selected as the Confederate capital. After the Confederate Army fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, beginning the Civil War, additional states seceded. Virginia voted to secede from the Union on April 17, 1861, and existed briefly thereafter as an independent republic before joining the Confederacy on June 19, 1861. However, on May 8, 1861, in the Confederate Capital City of Montgomery, Alabama, the decision was made to name the City of Richmond, Virginia as the new Capital of the Confederacy. The Confederate capital was moved to Richmond in recognition of Virginia's strategic importance. Virginia was the South's industrial center, with an industrial output nearly equal to that of all other Confederate states combined. The Confederacy also hoped the move would consolidate its hold on the state, since it had difficulty securing other states bordering the Union. The Seal of the Confederate States, adopted April 30, 1863, features a depiction of George Washington based on the Washington Monument adjacent to the Confederate Capitol building. Richmond remained the capital of the Confederacy until April 2, 1865, at which point the government evacuated and was re-established, albeit briefly, in Danville, Virginia.Hansen, Harry. The Civil War: A History. Signet Classics, 2002. . Industrial center The Tredegar Iron Works (1865) Positioned on the Fall Line along the James River, the city had ready access to an ample supply of hydropower to run mills and factories. The Tredegar Iron Works, sprawling along the James River, supplied high-quality munitions to the Confederacy during the war. The company also manufactured railroad steam locomotives in the same period. Tredegar is also credited with the production of approximately 10,000 artillery pieces during the war which was about half of the South's total domestic production of artillery between the war years of 1861‚Äì1865. The foundry made the 723 tons of armor plating that covered the CSS Virginia (the former USS Merrimack), which fought the first battle between ironclad warships in March 1862. The Tredegar works were adjacent to the Richmond Arsenal, which was recommissioned in the lead-up to the war. On Brown's Island, the Confederate States Laboratory was established to consolidate explosives production to an isolated setting in the eventuality of an accidental explosion. Numerous smaller factories in Richmond produced tents, uniforms, harnesses and leather goods, swords and bayonets, and other war material. As the war progressed, the city's warehouses became the supply and logistical center for much of the Confederate forces within the Eastern Theater. Richmond was also a transportation hub. It was the terminus of five railroads: the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad; the Virginia Central Railroad; the Richmond and York River Railroad; the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad; and the Richmond and Danville Railroad. In addition, the James River and Kanawha Canal ran through it with access to the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. At the fall of Richmond in April 1865, all but the Richmond and Danville Railroad and the canal had effectively been cut off by Union forces. Peninsula Campaign In the late spring of 1862, a large Federal army under Major General George B. McClellan landed on the Virginia Peninsula. McClellan, who had enjoyed early publicity from a series of successes in western Virginia, was assigned the task of seizing and occupying Richmond. His military maneuvers and the resulting battles and engagements became collectively known as the Peninsula Campaign, culminating in the Seven Days Battles. McClellan's starting base was the Union-held Fort Monroe at the eastern tip of the Peninsula. Efforts to take Richmond by the James River were successfully blocked by Confederate defenses at the Battle of Drewry's Bluff on May 15, about eight miles downstream from Richmond. The Union Army advance was halted shortly outside of the city at the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, 1862 (near the site of what is now Richmond International Airport). Seven Days Battles Over a period of seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, Richmond's defensive line of batteries and fortifications set up under General Robert E. Lee, a daring ride around the Union Army by Confederate cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart, and an unexpected appearance of General Stonewall Jackson's famous \\"foot cavalry\\" combined to unnerve the ever-cautious McClellan, and he initiated a Union retreat before Richmond. Even as other portions of the South were already falling, the failure of the Peninsula Campaign to take Richmond led to almost three more years of warfare between the states. Mid-war years Libby Prison in 1865, viewed from Dock Street As a result of its proximity to the battlefields of the Eastern Theater and its high level of defense, the city processed many casualties of both sides: as home to numerous hospitals (the largest such being Chimborazo Hospital), prisons (notably Libby Prison, Castle Thunder, and Belle Isle), and various cemeteries. On March 13, 1863, the Confederate Laboratory on Brown's Island was rocked by an explosion that killed dozens of workers. Bread riots in Richmond On April 2, 1863, the city was beset by a large bread riot as housewives could no longer afford very high food prices and broke into stores. The riot was organized by Mary Jackson, a huckster and the mother of a soldier. The militia was called out to end the riot.Michael B. Chesson, \\"Harlots or Heroines? A New Look at the Richmond Bread Riot.\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 92#2 (1984): 131-175. in JSTOR The Confederacy hit its high-water mark at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Subsequent campaigning in the balance of the year failed to bring about a decisive battle, and Richmond residents settled down to the winter of 1863‚Äì64 mostly still optimistic about the Confederacy's fortunes. One of the Civil War's most daring prison breaks, the Libby Prison escape, took place in February 1864 when more than 100 Federal captives escaped and fled into the night. Fewer than half were recaptured, with the majority reaching Union lines and safety. The city was shaken shortly thereafter by the March 2, 1864 Dahlgren Affair, a failed Union raid on the city. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign resulted in Robert E. Lee's Confederate army retiring to the vicinity of Richmond and Petersburg, where they checked Grant's progress. Evacuation and capture of Richmond Map of Richmond during the war; areas burnt during the evacuation in red After a long siege, Grant captured Petersburg and Richmond in early April 1865. As the fall of Petersburg became imminent, on Evacuation Sunday (April 2), President Davis, his Cabinet, and the Confederate defenders abandoned Richmond and fled south on the last open railroad line, the Richmond and Danville. The retreating soldiers were under orders to set fire to bridges, the armory, and supply warehouses as they left. The fire in the largely abandoned city spread out of control, and large parts of Richmond were destroyed, reaching to the very edge of Capitol Square mostly unchecked. The conflagration was not completely extinguished until the mayor and other civilians went to the Union lines east of Richmond on New Market Road (now State Route 5) and surrendered the city the next day. Union troops put out the raging fires in the city. The event became known as the Evacuation Fire. The occupation was overseen by General Godfrey Weitzel and later General Edward Ord. President Lincoln, who had been visiting General Grant and staying nearby at City Point, toured the fallen city (April 4‚Äì7) by foot and carriage with his young son Tad, and visited the former White House of the Confederacy and the Virginia State Capitol. About one week after the evacuation of Richmond, General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant on April 9 ending the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. Within the same week, on the evening of April 14, President Lincoln was assassinated in Washington D.C. by the Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Legacy Jefferson Davis Memorial, located at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Davis Avenue in Richmond Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery is the final burial place of many Civil War notables, including Jefferson Davis, Stuart, former U.S. President and Confederate Congressman John Tyler, Virginia Governors and Confederate Generals Henry A. Wise and William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith, Tredegar Iron Works owner and Confederate Brigadier General Joseph Reid Anderson, and Major Generals George Pickett, Fitzhugh Lee, Henry Heth, and John Imboden. A large, stone pyramid dominates the Confederate Soldiers' section, where over 18,000 (many of whom are unknown) Confederates are buried. War dead were also buried at Oakwood Cemetery, Shockoe Hill Cemetery, and the Cemetery for Hebrew Confederate Soldiers section of the Hebrew Cemetery. Numerous Union dead who were buried at these sites were re-interred after the war to several national cemeteries outside of the city. The city has a number of markers and monuments commemorating the Civil War and the city's role in the Confederacy. Monument Avenue was laid out in 1887, with a series of monuments at various intersections honoring the city's Confederate heroes. Included (east to west) were J.E.B. Stuart, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, and Matthew F. Maury. The Richmond National Battlefield Park, a unit of the National Park Service, maintains several battlefields from the Peninsula Campaign and subsequent actions. A driving tour through Civil War sites in Richmond and its surrounding counties is maintained by Virginia Civil War Trails. The White House of the Confederacy (part of the private, non-profit Museum of the Confederacy) has been fully restored to its wartime appearance and is open for daily tours. Immediately next door to the White House, the internationally renowned Museum of the Confederacy houses the largest comprehensive collection of artifacts and personal effects relating to the Confederacy. Other museums include the Virginia Historical Society. A statue of Lincoln, commemorating his visit to the former Confederate capitol, was unveiled in 2003, causing controversy. In popular culture The Charlie Daniels Band song, \\"Trudy\\", compares the taking of Richmond by Grant with the narrator saying that he was \\"raking in chips like Grant took Richmond\\" in a poker game. Robbie Robertson / The Band wrote 'The night they drove old Dixie down'. One lyric refers to, '...by May the 10th (1865) Richmond had fell, it was a time I remember oh so well'. On May 10, 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, fleeing Richmond and having dissolved the Confederate government, was captured by Union forces in Irwinville, Georgia.

The daughter of Polish-Jewish immigrants to the United States, she was a professor at George Washington University beginning in 1966. She was the mother of environmental activist Judi Bari, science reporter Gina Kolata and art historian Martha Bari. Career Bari grew up in Brooklyn and attended Brooklyn College, earning her bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1939. She earned her MA at Johns Hopkins University in 1943, but had originally enrolled in the doctoral program. When the university suggested that women in the graduate program should give up their fellowships so that men returning from World War II could study, Bari acceded.Kolata After marrying Arthur Bari she spent the next two decades devoted to family. She returned to Johns Hopkins, where she completed her dissertation on \\"absolute reducibility of maps of at most 19 regions\\" in 1966 at the age of 47. Bari's dissertation explored chromatic polynomials and the Birkhoff-Lewis conjecture. She determined that ‚ÄúBecause of the fact that all other cubic maps with fewer than 20 regions contain at least one absolutely reducible configuration, it follows that the Birkhoff-Lewis conjecture holds for all maps with fewer than 20 regions.‚ÄùBari, Ruth. Abstract: ‚ÄúAbsolute Reducibility of Maps of at Most 19 Regions.‚Äù Biographies of Women Mathematicians Her Ph.D. advisor was Daniel Lewis, Jr.Mathematics Genealogy Project After she received her degree, mathematician William Tutte invited Bari to spend two weeks lecturing on her work in Canada at the University of Waterloo. Bari's work in the areas of graph theory and homomorphisms‚Äîand especially chromatic polynomials‚Äîhas been recognized as influential. In 1976, two professors relied on computer work to solve the perennial problem of Bari's dissertation, involving the four-color conjecture. When her daughter Martha asked her if she felt cheated by the technological solution, Bari replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just grateful that it was solved within my lifetime and that I had the privilege to witness it.‚Äù During her teaching career, Bari participated in a class-action lawsuit against George Washington University which protested inequalities in promotion and pay for female faculty members. The protests were successful. Bari retired at the legally mandated age of 70 in 1988 with the distinction of professor emeritus. Community and Family Life Bari was active in the Washington, DC community. In the early 1970s, Bari used a grant from the National Science Foundation to start a master's degree program in teaching mathematics. She felt that math teachers in DC public schools were not as well prepared as they needed to be.Washington Post Her daughters also became influential in their fields. Gina Kolata is a mathematics, health and science journalist for the New York Times. Judi Bari (1949 ‚Äì 1997) was a leading labor and environmental activist and feminist, who survived an assassination attempt. Dr. Martha Bari is an art historian at Hood College Bari died on August 25, 2005. She was survived by her husband of 64 years of marriage, Arthur (1913-2006).

KU also serves five counties in Virginia under the name Old Dominion Power.About Kentucky Utilities It is owned by LG&E; and KU Energy, LLC, which, in turn, is owned by PPL Corporation. History Kentucky Utilities was formed in 1912 to serve five areas of Kentucky. In 1926, KU acquired Old Dominion Power. KU was acquired by LG&E; Energy, parent of Louisville Gas & Electric, in 1998. This combination was then acquired by British utility company Powergen in 2000, and ultimately Powergen was bought by German utility company E.ON in 2003. E.ON renamed LG&E; Energy as E.ON U.S. In 2010, E.ON U.S. was bought by PPL Corporation, who changed the name of the company to LG&E; and KU Energy. The use of the plural Utilities refers to the company's early sales mix of electricity and other utilities, including ice, which in its early days of mass-production, was made in some areas by electric utilities. The company still owns a 4-story structure on the northeast side of Lexington on Loudon Avenue known as the \\"Ice House\\". The facility was utilized for cold storage by Kentucky Utilities during the time when ice was part of its \\"Utilities\\" portfolio of offerings. The adjacent property on North Limestone Street utilized a power generation facility to provide DC (direct current) power for the city's trolley system in the early 1900s. This trolley system used the current rail line separating the two properties, which is now owned and operated by R. J. Corman Railroad. KU's facilities include the coal-fired generating station E. W. Brown Power Station, near Burgin, Kentucky. It sits adjacent to Lake Herrington, which was formed in 1926 by constructing Dix Dam, which contained hydro-electric generators. The company's electric distribution dispatch was located in Lexington until the consolidation of Louisville (LG&E;) and Lexington (KU) distribution dispatch centers in 2019. Legacy Kentucky Utilities power generation facilities include Pineville Station (located in Fourmile, KY) and Tyrone Station (located near Frankfort, KY). These facilities have been demolished as of early 2020. Other facilities include various Customer Business Office locations, Electric Distribution Operations Centers, Service Center and Storerooms scattered across the state and throughout the KU and ODP service territory. Acquisition by PPL Corporation PPL and E.ON announced on April 28, 2010, a definitive agreement under which PPL would acquire E.ON US, the parent company of KU and Louisville Gas & Electric, for $7.625 billion. The sale was closed on November 1, 2010.

Photocytes typically occur in select layers of epithelial tissue, functioning singly or in a group, or as part of a larger apparatus (a photophore). They contain special structures termed as photocyte granules. These specialized cells are found in a range of multicellular animals including ctenophora, coelenterates (cnidaria), annelids, arthropoda (including insects) and fishes. Although some fungi are bioluminescent, they do not have such specialized cells. Mechanism of light production Light production may first be triggered by nerve impulses which stimulate the photocyte to release the enzyme luciferase into a \\"reaction chamber\\" of luciferin substrate. In some species the release occurs continually without the precursor impulse via osmotic diffusion. Molecular oxygen is then actively gated through surrounding tracheal cells which otherwise limit the natural diffusion of oxygen from blood vessels; the resulting reaction with the luciferase and luciferin produces light energy and a by-product (usually carbon dioxide). Researchers once postulated that ATP was the source of reaction energy for photocytes, but since ATP only produces a fraction the energy of the luciferase reaction, any resulting light wave-energy would be too small for detection by a human eye. The wavelengths produced by most photocytes fall close to 490 nm; although light as energetic as 250 nm is reportedly possible. The variations of color seen in different photocytes are usually the result of color filters that alter the wavelength of the light prior to exiting the endoderm, thanks to the other parts of the photophore. The range of colors vary between bioluminescent species. The exact combinations of luciferase and luciferin types found among photocytes are specific to the species to which they belong. This would seem to be the result of consistent evolutionary divergence.

She was considered to be one of the most important Serbian female authors of her time. In 2001, the French President Jacques Chirac honored her with the Chevalier medal of Legion of Honor because she always took care to preserve the humanist values which unite her and her country with the rest of Europe. Life and work Svetlana Velmar-Jankoviƒá was born in Belgrade, in the city which should remain the center of life for her whole life until death. She grew up in city quarter Dorƒáol and was one of two daughters of Vladimir Velmar-Jankoviƒá, appointed deputy minister of education of the Government of National Salvation in the German Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, who escaped from Yugoslavia in September 1944. He left his wife and children behind. They had to accept serious social consequences because of that in communist Yugoslavia, and that was not easy to endure for the remained family members. At the beginning of the 3rd millennium, late efforts of his daughters to get him officially rehabilitated, ran into opposition. A brief statement by his famous daughter gives an idea of the long-term suffering of the family, and a question asked at the beginning of this millennium by a contemporary witness and representative of the post- war state, who was nobody else than Tito's official German language interpreter during state visits and receptions, brings up this issue to the point.John Neubauer, Borb√°la Zsuzsanna T√∂r√∂k, Exile and Return of Writers from East-Central Europe, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York 2009, , p. 32. After completion of her secondary school education, she graduated with maturity diploma at IV gymnasium for girls in 1951, she began studying French language and literature at the Philological Faculty of Belgrade's University, and completed with diploma in 1963. In 1953, still while her education at university, she became journalist and wrote contributions to the youth magazines Deƒçje ≈°tampe and Pioniri. From 1959 to 1975, she was editor of the literary journal Knji≈æevnost of Prosveta publishing house, and in 1971 she became member of the editorial board of this company, where she worked until 1989. In the meantime, she edited Prosveta's publication series Ba≈°tina (Heritage) which consists of prose and essays of numerous Serbian authors. She was elected corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 2006, and became a full member three years later. From 2007 to 2013, she was chairwoman of the board of directors of the National Library of Serbia. Svetlana Velmar-Jankoviƒá was married twice, her first marriage to journalist Miodrag Protiƒá ended with his death in 1974, after twenty one years of wedlock, and her son ƒêorƒëe (born in 1966) comes from this relationship, he emigrated to the United States of America. She is interred in an honorary grave of the Belgrade New Cemetery. Her second husband was ≈Ωarko Ro≈°ulj (born in 1940), who worked at Nolit publishing as a graphic editor from 1978 to 1996 and died in 2018.Ko je ko u Srbiji, Bibliofon, Belgrade 1996 (WBIS), retrieved 2020-01-18.Preminula Svetlana Velmar Jankoviƒá, Veƒçernje novosti (Wayback Machine), retrieved 2014-04-09.Biography, National Library of Serbia, retrieved 2020-01-18. In its obituary, the newspaper Politika cites the deceased lady once again who will never be passed away in collective memory and lives on in her books about places, people and generations. Her complete work is already including one or several editions in Bulgarian, German, English, French, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Macedonian and Spanish translation, most of all published in French. Internationally best known book from her complete work is the novel Lagum, which has also been published in Bulgarian, English (two editions in 1996 and 2002), French, German, Italian and Spanish translation. Lagum, a term of Turkish origin, refers to a dark dungeon-like underground passage, in which no light falls, as are numerous under the Kalemegdan fortress, and scene of the plot is the city of Belgrade, written from the perspective of the wife of a professor of Belgrade University. Protagonist Milica Pavloviƒá, first-person narrator, tells life events from her time period between 1928 and 1984. When her husband, the well- respected Du≈°an Pavloviƒá, tried to save as many people as possible from the Ustashe extermination camps in the Independent State of Croatia during the war and therefore co-operated with Serbian Quisling government, the couple became increasingly estranged. Above that, Milica hides a wounded partisan in the servant room of her apartment without her husband's knowledge and children. The takeover of power by the communist resistance fighters become the fate of the family: Du≈°an is executed as a collaborator, the apartment is ransacked by neighbors who hastily turned into zealous and cruel henchmen of the new regime. Milica is reviled as a traitor by people whom she and her husband had saved years ago. So also from that partisan who recovered hidden in family's flat. It is a sensitive but relentless portrait of society, a profound analysis of human contradictions, character weaknesses and political opportunism.The Balkans and the West: Constructing the European Other, 1945‚Äì2003, Ashgate Publishing, Farnham 2004,, p. 104. Celia Hawkesworth, English translator of the novel Lagum, describes this work as follows: For the past three decades of her life, Svetlana Velmar-Jankoviƒá was not only a recognized Grande Dame of Serbian literature, but also a loud voice of conscience who courageously and unequivocally advocated democracy and human rights, based on humanism and European values of the Western world. Many possible examples could illustrate this, but only two are briefly presented here: an excerpt from her speech during the 1991 protests including the beginning of the Yugoslav wars and her statement about the Serbian declaration on Srebrenica massacre. She was also a member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Komisija za istinu i pomirenje).Serbian Declaration on Srebrenica Massacre, ICTJ, retrieved 2020-01-15.Truth and Reconciliation Commission, United States Institute of Peace (Wayback Machine), retrieved 2020-01-18.

Established in 1999, its sole project is the Long Lake oil sands project, of which it owns 35%. The remaining 65% is owned by project operator Nexen Inc. History OPTI was founded as Ormat Process Technologies Inc. in 1999 by Israeli energy company Ormat Industries, which had developed the OrCrude process in the 1990s. Ormat was approached by Calgary-based Nexen, who sent a delegation to Israel to supervise a test of the process. However, using OrCrude in the oil sands appeared uneconomical to Nexen, who withdrew. Ormat instead contacted Calgary's Suncor Energy, with whom it founded OPTI as a 50-50 venture, with the Nexen delegation's head, Jim Arnold, as its first employee. Suncor's land at Burnt Lake was used by Ormat to build an OrCrude demonstration plant, using oil supplied by Suncor. However, Suncor soon withdrew from the venture, and Nexen returned to take a 50% stake. In 2004, the OPTI decided to expand Long Lake to commercial-scale, and raised over $1.5 billion of private equity and debt. Also in 2004, OPTI underwent a $300 million initial public offering (IPO). In January 2009 OPTI sold 15% working interest in Long Lake project to Nexen for $735 million, following an 89% drop in share price and increasing expenses. In early 2011 OPTI faced severe liquidity problems and an inability to service its $2.8 billion debt. Its shareprice closed at $0.30 on February 4, 2011, down from a high of $24.85 in 2008. Analysts believed bankruptcy or restructuring of the company was likely. On November 28, 2011 it was announced the company had been acquired by CNOOC Luxembourg S.√† r.l, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited. The total value of the Acquisition was approximately US$2.1 billion. Long Lake The Long Lake project uses OPTI's proprietary OrCrude process, which produces usable fuel from byproducts of extracted bitumen. This fuel is used to generate steam for bitumen extraction using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology. OrCrude additionally produces hydrogen, which is used for hydrocracking in the refining process. Typically, natural gas is used to generate steam for SAGD extraction. However, using OrCrude-generated fuel significantly reduces the need for natural gas, reducing OPTI's operating costs by approximately $10 per barrel of oil produced.

The fort and associated round barrow has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register due to vulnerability to vehicle damage and erosion. View north from the summit towards the Bristol Channel, the village of Holford is in view. Earthworks at Dowsborough hill fort Situation The site is at a height of 1115' (340 metres) on an easterly spur from the main Quantock ridge, with views north to the Bristol Channel, and east over the valley of the River Parrett. The fort has an oval shape, with a single rampart and ditch (univallate) following the contours of the hill top, enclosing an area of 6¬æ acres (2.7 hectares). The main entrance is to the east, towards Nether Stowey, with a simpler opening to the north-west, aligned with a ridgeway leading down to Holford. The Lady's Fountain springs are in the combe to the west. A col to the south connects the hill to the main Stowey ridge, where a linear earthwork known as Dead Woman's Ditch cuts across the spur. This additional rampart would have provided an extra line of defence against attack from the main Quantock ridge to the west, and it could have been a tribal boundary. Saxon era In Saxon times, King Alfred's military road, the Herepath, ran up from Combwich, Cannington (a possible site of the Battle of Cynwit) and Over Stowey, along the present course of the Stowey road, across Dead Woman's Ditch to Crowcombe Park Gate, south along the main ridge of the Quantocks to Triscombe Stone, then west across the valley to the Brendon Hills and Exmoor.Dumnonia and the Valley of the Parret, Rev. W.H.P. Greswell (1922) The road connected a series of forts and lookout posts, which allowed Alfred's armies to move along the coast to cover Viking movements at sea and forestall any raids ashore. The path from Dowsborough to the Herepath is called Great Bear Path, and this is taken to be a corruption of Great Herepath, which suggests that Dowsborough could have been a Saxon lookout over the Bristol Channel.

It is known to reach a mantle length of 11 cm. It is distributed in the tropical and subtropical oceans around the world. It is the only species in the genus Sandalops but some authorities suggest that this may be a species complex rather than a monotypic genus. Description Sandalops melancholicus is a small squid which grows to a mantle length of 110mm. There are only suckers on the tentacular clubs with a further two series of suckers and pads on distal half of the stalk of the tentacles. It does no possess a funnel valve and the funnel organ has a distal pad and two large triangle shaped flaps. It has short, round fins with the posterior end of the gladius protruding between them. Like Liguriella, but not in any other Taoniinae, it has two contiguous photophores on its eye, a large one and a small one, and it does not have any photophores on its arms. The juveniles have tubular eyes, a feature shared with Taonius, and the broad vanes on the gladius are very distinctive, a useful characteristic for identifying Sandalops. Distribution Sandalops melancholicus is a cosmopolitan species which has a circumglobar distribution in the subtropical and tropical oceans. The type specimen was original taken off Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic. There may be three or four closely related species rather than a single species within Sandalops. Biology Sandalops melancholicus occurs in the epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, like other glass squid it has a pattern of moving deeper as it matures, called ontogenetic descent. There is no evidence of any movements governed by time of day. The paralarvae inhabit the upper few hundred metres of the water column, the epipelagic zone. Their eyes are laterally compressed and they have a rostrum, the rostrum and the lateral compression allow the opaque eyes to be concealed in the squid's otherwise transparent body. The paralarval eyes are what give this species both its most common vernacular name, sandal-eyed squid and its generic name of Sandalops. The juveniles are found in the upper mesopelagic zone, also called the \\"twilight zone\\" and here they develop tubular eyes. Its head is angled with respect to the body axis and in life the eyes point upwards to the light and have their lower silhouette hidden by the two photophores. The sub- adults occur lower in the mesopelagic zone and their eyes are hemispherical in shape. By the time they are sexually mature adults they have reached the bathypelagic zone, below 2000m and it is here that mating takes place. In mature males the arms are modified, they are broad closest to the head and the protective membranes are expanded. The protective membranes do not extend towards the tips of the arms. The suckers on the arms are greatly reduced in size in at least two series on arms II and III. The sub-adult females lose their tentacles and are heavily pigmented. Adults have spherical protruding eyes.

As the first Chairman & CEO of EMI Music Worldwide, Bhaskar Menon is best known as a music industry executive, overseeing the EMI Group‚Äôs worldwide operations and subsidiaries. A citizen of the United States, Menon was born in India where he was educated at The Doon School http://rollingstoneindia.com/features/the-man-who-showed-pink- floyd-the-bright-side/WSJ.com - The Andover of India? and received a B.A. Honours degree from the University of Delhi. He earned a master's degree from Christ Church, Oxford University, and joined EMI Limited in London. Transferred to India and the Far East, he was appointed Chairman, Managing Director and Chief Executive of EMI's Indian subsidiary. Menon returned to London as Divisional Director and General Manager (Overseas) of EMI Limited responsible for the Group's interests and investments outside the U.K. He was concurrently appointed Managing Director of EMI International Services Limited with direct operating responsibility for companies in 25 countries. He represented EMI on the Boards of several subsidiary and associated companies including Capitol Industries in the U.S.A. and Toshiba EMI Limited in Japan. Menon transferred to Los Angeles and was elected President and Chief Executive Officer of Capitol Industries Inc,a public corporation in which EMI held majority interest. He was appointed a Director of the parent Board of EMI Limited, and elected Chairman of the Board of Capitol Industries Inc. in addition to remaining President and Chief Executive Officer of all its operating companies in North America including Capitol Records, the Merco & MusicDen Retail Group, Capitol Magnetic Products division, and of the Screen Gems and Colgems music publishing companies and United Artists Records which he acquired for Capitol/EMI. He was also Chairman of EMI Films Inc. and EMI Television Programs Inc. Menon turned around the financially troubled Capitol EMI into a successful major player in the music industry. In a 1978 article, the publication New Musical Express noted, \\"Within a year he had turned Capitol's $15 million loss into a profit. His motto for his employees was simple: 'Uncompromising excellence in what you do goes without saying. We expect more than that.\\" New Musical Express, 1978, \\"The Man Who Really Runs Rock & Roll\\" A recent posting on the FYI music site had this to say about Menon's achievements at EMI. \\"Menon pulled the British companies sprawling assets, spread over 46 countries, under one roof and created EMI Music Worldwide in 1978. Menon was a great team builder, he had a passion for music and he loved entertaining and hanging out with musicians. Just like the incredible team that built Warner, Elektra and Atlantic. From what I remember of Bhaskar Menon, his kindness, generosity and sharp intellect were appreciated by the stable of talent the company acquired and held on to in those years.\\" Memories of Menon, excerpted from the FYI Music news blog .  Career highlights  As its first chairman and CEO, Menon formed EMI Music Worldwide in 1978, which brought together under his unified global management all of EMI Group's records and music publishing interests throughout the world. Among the world's foremost companies in the entertainment business, the multibillion-dollar EMI Music Group headquartered in London has operations in over 46 countries. When Thorn Electrical Industries and EMI joined together to form Thorn EMI, one of the world's largest companies in their respective businesses, Menon was appointed as Director of the parent Board of the merged company at its inception in December 1979. He remained Chairman of EMI Music Worldwide and a Director of the Thorn EMI plc Board until he retired from the Group in 1990. Menon with the Dutch singer Jack Jersey, 1974 During his many years in the international music business, Menon was closely associated with the careers of a number of outstanding popular artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Jack Jersey, Glen Campbell, Kenny Rogers, Tina Turner, Anne Murray, Peggy Lee, Paul McCartney & Wings, Duran Duran, Nancy Wilson, Iron Maiden, Diana Ross, Bob Seger, Carole King, and Steve Miller. He also worked with classical performers like Yehudi Menuhin, Herbert von Karajan, Maria Callas, Ricardo Muti, Itzhak Perlman, and Daniel Barenboim. In his recent memoirs, Duran Duran's Andy Taylor noted, \\"We decided to go with EMI, because we knew they had a global network and could launch bands across America. The company was headed by the legendary music industry figure, Bhaskar Menon, who'd presided over EMI during the rise of the Beatles.\\" (Andy Taylor, quoted in Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran) As Chairman of EMI India, Menon was involved in the careers of that country's leading film, popular and classical singers and musicians. During his Chairmanship of EMI Films Inc, the company produced such masterpieces as the multi-Oscar-winning Deer Hunter, Murder on the Orient Express, and Passage to India.  Dark Side of the Moon  In 1973, Menon played the central role in leading the promotion and marketing of Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon. He literally put the power of Capitol/EMI behind the band with a tremendous marketing, PR and advertising effort. The album which has been called \\"the most technically advanced recording of its time\\" was hailed as a unique blend of studio wizardry and outstanding musical innovation. As such it might have achieved some success without Menon's support, but Pink Floyd's sales in the US had been modest up to that point, and the promotion certainly encouraged success internationally. In the UK, Pink Floyd had blocked the release of singles. Menon pushed for the songs, \\"Us and Them\\" and \\"Time\\" to be edited and released as singles for American radio. To date, The Dark Side of the Moon has spent 950 weeks on the USA-based Billboard 200 album chart, the longest duration of any album in history. It is also the fourth highest selling album globally of all time, selling more than forty million units. Menon was featured in the documentary , \\"The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Menon‚Äôs contributions to the Dark Side of the Moon album‚Äôs success were recognized and when asked in an interview whether he was surprised at the results of his efforts he was quoted as saying, \\"I always believed that the record would be very, very successful. It was gratifying, but not surprising.\\"  Concert for Bangladesh  In 1971, Menon and Capitol joined with ex-Beatle George Harrison and Apple in releasing the live recording of the Madison Square Garden \\"Concert for Bangladesh\\" which was inspired by Harrison and his friend Ravi Shankar. Besides George Harrison, Ringo Starr and Bob Dylan, the concert and the recording featured a bevy of some of the most important musical artists in the Western world. Most of these artists had exclusive recording commitments to different competitive labels. Despite the frustration and impatience of Harrison and everyone else involved, the contractual obligations of the performers required protracted negotiations to resolve, and the \\"live\\" album was released in December 1971, five months after the Concert. According to George Harrison, interviewed in November 1971 on the Dick Cavett Show, Bhaskar Menon was responsible for the delay, as he wanted Capitol to make profit out of this album, while all the other record companies let the performances of their artists being used for free.YouTube This event was the first significant benefits concert for humanitarian causes organized and supported by musicians.  Awards and honors  Menon served as President of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the trade association of the world recording industry, with 1,100 members and national groups in 71 countries. He was elected to the newly created position of Chairman of the Board of the Federation. He was awarded the IFPI \\"Medal of Honor\\" in recognition of his services to the worldwide music industry . He remained a Director of the American Recording Industry Association, (RIAA) from 1971 to 1990. In 1990, Menon was appointed to the rank of \\"Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres\\" (Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters) by the French Minister of Culture. This order is one of the principal decorations conferred by the French Republic to honor individuals who had distinguished themselves by their contributions to the influence of the arts and literature. Other recipients of the Award include Herbert von Karajan, Wilhelm Kempff, Ray Charles, Leonard Cohen and Jack Nicholson.  After EMI  Menon has been Chairman of I.M.I.

History  Historic aerial photograph by Werner Friedli from 1955 The story of Leukerbad dates back to the 4th century B.C. Graves and ceramics attest the presence of habitation in Leukerbad. From the 5th century, the pass of the Gemmi, a unique link between the cantons of Valais and Bern, has been in use. A view of Leukerbad from the Gemmi Pass In 1229, Leukerbad is mentioned for the first time and called \\"Boez\\". French was the locally spoken language at that time. In 1315, the commune becomes independent and the oldest known document about Leukerbad already mentions the baths. In 1501, the Bishop and Cardinal Matth√§us Schiner acquires the rights for the baths and speaks highly of the health resort during his visits; the thermal tourism develops. By that time, German (Walser German, brought by the Walser migrations) is spoken locally. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, several major avalanches hit the village but the inhabitants rebuilt it each time. During the early history of tourism in Switzerland, a number of notable guests visited Leukerbad, including Isabelle de Charri√®re (1776 and 1777), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1779), Guy de Maupassant (1877) and Mark Twain (1878). In 1908, the Company ‚ÄúChemin de Fer Electric Leukerbad‚Äù was founded but the road quickly dominated the access to the village and the trains stopped in 1967. The cable-car to the top of Gemmi Pass was built in 1957 and the one to Torrent Alp in 1970-72. Beginning in the 1980s, the municipality under president Otto G. Loretan began to undertake massive investments into infrastructure. In 1980, the community's thermal centre, The Burgerbad, was opened. The sports centre followed in 1990 and the thermal centre Alpentherme in 1993. In 1998, Leukerbad offered for the first time a \\"fixed-rope climbing\\" (Via ferrata/Klettersteig) route of the Daubenhorn, which is currently the longest in Switzerland. By 1998, the municipality had accumulated debts of CHF 346 million (some CHF 200,000 per inhabitant), and as the first municipality in the history of Switzerland had to file for bankruptcy. As a consequence, Leukerbad was placed under cantonal administration during 1998 to 2004. Former president Loretan was convicted to a five-year prison sentence for fraud in August 2004.  Geography  Aerial view of Leukerbad Leukerbad has an area, , of . Of this area, or 14.2% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 8.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 1.4% is settled (buildings or roads), or 2.0% is either rivers or lakes and or 73.6% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 0.8% and transportation infrastructure made up 0.3%. Out of the forested land, 6.2% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.7% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 0.0% is used for growing crops and 2.6% is pastures and 11.6% is used for alpine pastures. Of the water in the municipality, 1.1% is in lakes and 0.9% is in rivers and streams. Of the unproductive areas, 9.0% is unproductive vegetation, 53.8% is too rocky for vegetation and 10.8% of the land is covered by glaciers. Leukerbad is situated in the canton of Valais in the south of Switzerland at above sea level. The location is very impressive because of the cliffs which surround Leukerbad: To the east, the Daubenhorn at above sea level; to the north the Gemmi Pass () and the Balmhorn (); to the west the Torrenthorn (). The road which leads to Leukerbad comes into the secluded valley from the south and the town of Leuk in the Rhone valley.  Gemmi  Rinderhorn mountains The Gemmi Pass is famous in the history of the Valais because it had for a long time been a very busy route between Valais and Bern. The Gemmi is accessible with the cable-car which connects Leukerbad to the highest point on the pass () From the pass, there are extensive views of the Alps. The region is well known in summer for its hiking trails to Kandersteg, Adelboden or the Wildstrubel. It is visited by the families too because of the small lake called \\"Daubensee\\" which is surrounded by easy walks and provides a popular place for picnics. In winter, this same lake is ideal for the cross- country skiers but you can also go there for a snow-shoe trail, a run downhill with a sledge or just a walk on prepared, signposted hikes.  Torrent  The cable-car to Torrent Alp brings to the Rinderh√ºtte at above sea level. In winter it is the paradise of skiers who then have of runs at their disposal. In summer it offers a huge network of hiking and mountain bike trails. The panoramic views from the Rinderh√ºtte of the peaks of the Valais, French and Italian Alps is breath taking.  Thermal baths  Burgerbad The history of the springs of Leukerbad dates back to Roman times. People, even then, were already aware of the therapeutic effect of the thermal water. Today, of thermal water - up to - flow from the springs and feed 22 thermal pools. Several baths are at the disposal of guests in private hotels, in the Rehabilitation centre and in the Volksheilbad , but the biggest public baths are the Leukerbad Therme (previously Burgerbad) and the Lindner Alpentherme.

The book tells the story of a British naval expedition in World War I, which travelled thousands of miles through the Belgian Congo to Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa in order to win control of the lake from the Germans with just two boats - Mimi and Toutou.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/228e8106-128a-11d9-863e-00000e2511c8.html#axzz3MILO9iD6 Financial Times, Book Review. 2004 According to academic Dirk G√∂ttsche the book gives a critical postcolonial perspective and assessment on colonialism. This is reflected through grotesque and absurd actions of the actors involved, specifically those of Geoffrey Spicer-Simson.P.128, Remembering Africa: The Rediscovery of Colonialism in Contemporary German Literature by Dirk G√∂ttsche. Camden House. 2013 Summary During World War One, German warships controlled Lake Tanganyika, which is the longest Lake in the world and was of great strategic value in Central Africa at the time. The British had no naval craft at all upon 'Tanganjikasee' (as the Germans called it). After the destruction of the Belgian warship - Del Commune and through the actions of a British informant known as Lee and his observations of the two German warships, including the Hedwig von Wissman, the British Admiralty and Admiral Sir David Gamble decided that a naval expedition was needed to retake the Lake from the Germans. They were unaware of the existence of a much larger German vessel on the lake, the Graf von G√∂tzen. So, in June 1915, a force of 28 men was dispatched from Britain on a long journey. Their commanding officer was an eccentric naval officer called Geoffrey Spicer-Simson who was known for being the oldest Lieutenant Commander in the Royal Navy, a man court-martialled for wrecking his own ships and a complete liar. He was given command of two small gunboats, which he named Mimi and Toutou (childish onomatopoeia for \\"Cat\\" and \\"Dog\\" in French). After a monthlong journey to South Africa via the Atlantic Ocean, the boats and expedition travelled by train to the Congo. There, with great difficulty, the expedition carried the two boats, with the aid of steam engines and mules, to the edge of Lake Tanganyika. They captured one ship, the Kigani, and named her Fifi; they also sank the Hedwig von Wissman, but did not engage the formidable Graf von G√∂tzen, which remained dominant on the lake until she was scuttled in the wake of an Anglo-Belgian attack overland on German positions.http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/5635563/sideshow-on-the- lake/ Spectator, Book Review. 2009 Today The scuttled ship Graf von G√∂tzen was raised and now operates on the lake as the MV Liemba.

She was the first woman to be elected president of the Mathematics Association of America.MAA presidents: Dorothy Lewis Bernstein Early life Dorothy Bernstein was born in Chicago, the daughter of Jewish Russian immigrants Jacob and Tille Lewis Bernstein. While her parents had no formal education, they encouraged all of their children to seek education; all five earned either a PhD or MD. Education Bernstein attended North Division High School (Milwaukee) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1930 she attended the University of Wisconsin, where she held a University Scholarship (1933‚Äì1934) and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1934 she graduated with both a B.A degree, summa cum laude, and a M.A. Degree in Mathematics. She did her master's thesis research on finding complex roots of polynomials by an extension of Newton's method. In 1935 she attended Brown University, where she became a member of the scientific society Sigma Xi. She received her Ph.D. in mathematics from Brown in 1939, while simultaneously holding a teaching position at Mount Holyoke College. Her dissertation was entitled \\"The Double Laplace Integral\\" and was published in the Duke Mathematical Journal. Career From 1943‚Äì1959 Bernstein taught at the University of Rochester, where she worked on existence theorems for partial differential equations. Her work was motivated by non-linear problems that were just being tackled by high-speed digital computers. In 1950, Princeton University Press published her book, Existence Theorems in Partial Differential Equations. She spent 1959‚Äì1979 as a professor of mathematics at Goucher College, where she was chairman of the mathematics department for most of that time (1960‚Äì70, 1974‚Äì79). She professed that she was particularly interested combining pure and applied mathematics in the undergraduate curriculum. Due in great part to Bernstein's ability to get grants from the National Science Foundation, Goucher College was the first women's university to use computers in mathematics instruction, beginning in 1961. She also developed an internship program for Goucher mathematics students to obtain meaningful employment experience. In 1972 Bernstein cofounded the Maryland Association for Educational Uses of Computers, and was interested in incorporating computers into secondary school mathematics. Bernstein was very active in the Mathematical Association of America, where she was on the board of governors from 1965 to 1968. She served as the vice president in 1972‚Äì73, and later became the first female president of the MAA in 1979‚Äì80. Women in mathematics She noted that attitudes and opportunities for women changed drastically after World War II, which she attributed to two causes.

History Supreme Court of the Republic of China at Judicial Building (1949-1992) Former Supreme Court of the Republic of China in Nanjing. The court in Taiwan (Formosa) was originally established in 1896, the second year after Taiwan became a part of Japan. The Taiwan High Court at this era, can be considered to be the de facto supreme court in Taiwan, because the case cannot be further appealed to the Supreme Court in Tokyo. After the second world war, Japan gave up its sovereignty on Taiwan, and the supreme court of Taiwan's judicial system has become the Supreme Court of the Republic of China. The Supreme Court of the Republic of China was originally established as the Ta Li Yuan () in 1909. After the Chinese reunification, the government of the Republic of China renamed the Dali Yuan to the Supreme court in 1927 and made the Court the nation's court of last resort in 1928. On March 1949, the Court was moved to Canton with the Judicial Yuan. Shortly after in August 1949, the Court was moved to Taipei, Taiwan, where the Kuomintang government retreated after the Chinese Civil War. Originally it was located at Judicial Building at Chung- king South Road, but it was later moved to its current location on Chang-sha Street since 1992.See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, History, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/english/index.php?parent_id=300 (last visited Mar. 28, 2012) Introduction The Organic Law of the Court states that the judicial system shall be composed of the Supreme Court, High Courts, and District Courts, in which the system of ‚Äúthree-level and three-instance‚Äù is used.See Organic Law of the Court, Art. 1, available at http://law.moj.gov.tw (last visited Nov. 25, 2010) The Supreme Court is the court of last resort for civil and criminal cases. Except for civil cases involving amounts not exceeding NT $1,500,000 and petty offences enumerated in Article 376 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, any civil or criminal case may be appealed to the Court.See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, Preface, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/english/index.php?parent_id=299 (last visited Mar. 28, 2012) More specifically, the Court exercises jurisdiction over the following cases:See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, Jurisdiction, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/english/index.php?parent_id=302 (last visited Mar. 28, 2012) *appeals from judgments of High Courts or their branches as courts of first instance in criminal cases; *appeals from judgments of High Courts or their branches as courts of second instance in civil and criminal cases; *appeals from rulings of High Courts or their branches; *appeals from judgments or rulings rendered by the civil court of second instance by the summary procedure, the amounts in controversy exceeding NT $1,500,000, and with permission granted in accordance with specified provisions; *civil and criminal retrials within the jurisdiction of the court of third instance; *extraordinary appeals; or *any other case as specified by laws. One thing special about the Supreme Court of Taiwan is that it has many chambers. Now there are 9 criminal chambers and 8 civil chambers, each consists of 5 judges. All the appeal cases are decided by these chambers. Because these chambers might have different opinions, the function of the Supreme Court to unify the construction of the law in the country is substantially diminished. In order to unify the opinions, judges in civil chambers and criminal chambers hold meetings regularly and make resolutions on legal questions. Those resolutions are not officially binding, but have de facto binding effect. Procedure Cases are forwarded to either the Civil Section or the Criminal Section, which will record the case according to the year, class of case, as well as order of receipt. The case is reviewed by the Rules for Initial Review of Civil and Criminal Cases. After review, if the Court finds the case is defective, it will send the case back to the original court or order the party to amend the defects. If the Court finds the case to be in good form, the case is then sent to the Case Assignment Subsection, which will assign the case to a certain justice. Cases before the Supreme Court are heard and decided by a panel of five judges, with the Division Chief Judge acting as the presiding judge and the chairperson in deliberation.See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, The Supreme Court's Procedure, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/english/index.php?parent_id=565 (last visited Mar. 28, 2012) The Court decides only issues of law, and must base its decision on the facts ascertained in the judgment of the court of second instance (High Court). An appeal may be made to the Court only on the grounds that the original judgment is in violation of law or order. Documentary review proceedings are the norm, but if necessary, the presiding justice hear oral arguments in which issues of law are debated. The Supreme Court has a President, who is of the special appointment rank and who is in charge of the administrative affairs of the entire court and who acts concurrently as a Judge.See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, The Supreme Court's Organization, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/english/index.php?parent_id=301(last visited Mar. 28, 2012) Presidents * (5 November 1927 ‚Äì 13 November 1928) * (13 November 1928 ‚Äì 5 November 1932) *Ju Zheng (5 November 1932 ‚Äì 22 July 1935) * (22 July 1935 ‚Äì 26 September 1940) * (30 January 1941 ‚Äì 3 February 1945) * Xia Qin (3 February 1945 ‚Äì 13 July 1948) Post 1947 Constitution * Xie Yingzhou(13 July 1948Ôºç1966)See The Supreme Court of the Republic of China, Presidents, available at http://tps.judicial.gov.tw/about/?parent_id=588 (last visited 28 March 2012) * (1966Ôºç1968) * (1968Ôºç1972) * (1972Ôºç1987) * (1987Ôºç1993) * (1993Ôºç1996) * (1996Ôºç1998) * (1998Ôºç2001) * (2001Ôºç2007) * (2007Ôºç2012) * (2012Ôºç2015) * (2015‚Äì ) Prominent Judges # Chang Chin-lan was the first female supreme court judge of the Republic of China.

Interpretation The song, the second track on Funeral, is (according to Win Butler) about the Russian space program sending the dog Laika into space. Laika was the first living creature to orbit Earth. Butler told Pulse, a Minneapolis publication, \\"It‚Äôs a great story about a dog being the first living creature in space.

Many were adaptations of folk tales from around the world, especially Yiddish and other Eastern European stories. She and her husband Harvey Fischtrom, writing as Harve Zemach, collaborated on several picture books including Duffy and the Devil for which she won the 1974 Caldecott Medal. Life Margot Zemach was born in Los Angeles. When she was growing up there during the Great Depression, she used drawing to make people laugh but she never had enough paper. She studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute and, on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1955‚Äì1956, at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria. In 1957, Zemach married Harvey Fischtrom (1933‚Äì1974). They had four daughters, including Kaethe Zemach who is another writer and illustrator of children's books. Margot Zemach died in Berkeley, California on May 21, 1989, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. Career Zemach began her career when Fischtrom urged her to do children's books. Houghton Mifflin published their first collaboration in 1959, Small boy is listening, based on their experiences in Vienna. She did the illustrations and he did the text under the pseudonym Harve Zemach. Next year Little, Brown published her work with another writer, Take a Giant Step by Hannelore Hahn. The husband- and-wife team produced 13 books together, often simply as \\"Harvey & Margot Zemach\\" although he wrote and she illustrated. For Duffy and the Devil: a Cornish tale (1973), Margot won the Caldecott Medal from the American Library Association recognizing the year's best-illustrated U.S. children's picture book. The book was also a finalist for the annual National Book Award, Children's Literature and it was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1976. Zemach was one of the Caldecott runners-up in 1970 for The Judge: An Untrue Tale, written by Harve, and in 1978 for It Could Always Be Worse: A Yiddish Folk Tale, which she retold. Kaethe Zemach's first publication was her only collaboration with her parents, published the year after her father died. The Princess and Froggie (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1975) was a collection of stories written by Harve and Kaethe, illustrated by Margot. For her contribution as a children's illustrator, Zemach was 1980 and 1988 U.S. nominee for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition for creators of children's books. A manuscript by Margot for a picture book about sibling rivalry, based on her children, was illustrated by Kaethe and published by Arthur A. Levine Books in 2005, Eating up Gladys.

He is a televangelist who hosts Power and Mercy on Black Entertainment Television, The Word Network, and other television channels. He is the successor to the late A. A. Allen's organization.  Origins and early ministry  According to his official biography, Stewart is the youngest of six children and at age 13, Don had developed a severe bone disease, but after four major surgeries when he was 15 years old \\"God miraculously healed him. Currently, he lives in a $2.5 million Paradise Valley, Arizona, home owned by his church, and his family earns hundreds of thousands of dollars from his church. The Arizona Republic reports \\"His ministry, the Don Stewart Association, operates out of a nondescript warehouse in an industrial park near Interstate 17.\\" Stewart's son, Brendon Stewart conducts his own \\"Miracle Crusades.\\" Stewart first worked with Allen, starting with \\"pounding tent stakes at Allen's revivals to driving a truck to preaching\\". One of Allen's rising young evangelistic proteges during the early 1960s along with the likes of R. W. Schambach and Leroy Jenkins, Stewart served as evangelist and secretary treasurer of Allen's organization, and \\"was hit with allegations of embezzlement by Allen's brother-in-law, of pocketing offerings from the revivals\\" in the wake of Allen's death. When the controversial Allen died from alcohol poisoning as a result of an alcoholic binge in 1970, Stewart tried to clean up Allen's room before the police came. After Allen's death, Stewart gained complete possession of Allen's organization, including his Miracle Valley property, and renamed Allen's Miracle Life Fellowship International the Don Stewart Evangelistic Association (and later the Don Stewart Association).Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing Co., 1988), p. 832. From 1979 until early 1983, the Christ Miracle Healing Church and Center led by Frances Thomas, a disciple of Allen's, purchased and occupied land on Miracle Valley's subdivision property across Highway 92 from the bible church. The fundamentalist, cult-like church and its 300 members had several confrontations with utility workers, neighbors and eventually law enforcement resulting in what became known as the Miracle Valley shootout. This confrontation resulted in the shooting deaths of two of its senior members and injuries to multiple sheriff's deputies. Immigrants from Chicago and Mississippi rioted, which resulted in the death of Therial Davis, a six-year-old. The land was abandoned within a couple of weeks. The Don Stewart organization was not affiliated with the CMHCC. In 1982, Miracle Valley's main administration building and vast warehouse were set on fire by arson, which resulted in the total destruction of the facilities. The main building was valued at $2 million. Stewart sent multiple donation requests to some people on his 100,000 person mailing list \\"even though his ministry is not associated with the college and the fire damage was insured.\\" According to the press, one of his letters \\"gave the impression ... the fire had crippled Stewart's ministry\\" and another purported to include the buildings ashes with a request for $200 donations. He was \\"accused by another church of committing arson for an insurance payoff.\\" His own church had issues over Stewart's financing and \\"questioned Stewart's fundraising techniques\\" before.  Current work and controversy  The Don Stewart Association controls \\"Feed My People,\\" the \\"Southwest Indian Children's Fund\\", and \\"Miracle Life Fellowship International\\" (with offices in the Philippines). Additionally, Stewart also started the Northern Arizona Food Bank, which is operated by his association and directed by Kerry Ketcum. Stewart's organizations in the early 1990s as well as more recently have been criticized for not making its expenditures public. In 1992, USA Today cited Feed My People/Don Stewart Association among a group of organizations that \\"did not reply to BBB disclosure requests.\\" In 1993, the Washington Post reported, \\"Feed My People International, an arm of the Don Stewart Association (a church)\\" sends \\"Prospective donors get heart- rending letters on behalf of starving children, with virtually no facts about where and how the money is distributed. Three watchdog groups have asked for details and been turned down.\\" In 2008, the Better Business Bureau reported, the Don Stewart Association \\"did not provide requested information. As a result, the Better Business Bureau cannot determine if it meets standards.\\" Then in 1997, The Business Journal noted that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating Stewart's organization for mail fraud concerning high salaries and an $8 million annual income. After an investigation, the IRS \\"revoked the tax exemption of the Phoenix-based Don Stewart Association.\\" Among the reasons for the IRS revoking tax exemption was \\"impermissible benefits\\" to the Stewart family. As of 2008, according to the IRS, it is currently tax-exempted. In 1998, the Washington Post reported, Don Stewart's \\"followings all but disappeared after investigations,\\" but he has \\"joined dozens of other preachers to become fixtures on BET.\\" Consequently, Stewart along with Peter Popoff and Robert Tilton received \\"criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community.\\" G. Richard Fisher, of The Quarterly Journal, has been critical of Stewart's prosperity theology teachings and purported healing miracles. The national U.S. television program Inside Edition with the Trinity Foundation investigated Stewart's wealth and fundraising practices. In 1996, the Dallas Morning News noted that some of Stewart's fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who heads a multimillion-dollar marketing empire, writing donation letters for other evangelicals like WV Grant, Robert Tilton, Rex Humbard, and Oral Roberts. Included in some of Stewart's fundraising letters was Stewart's green \\"prayer cloth\\" with claims that it has supernatural healing power. Stewart's television programs and website currently offer the \\"Green Prosperity Prayer Handkerchief\\" which he claims people can use \\"to receive abundant blessings of financial prosperity\\". In a 2009 Skeptic article, Marc Carrier wrote about Stewart's handkerchief and his financial earnings explaining the handkerchief is a \\"mere 17x17 cm\\" and came with a letter requesting a \\"seed faith\\" in the amount of \\"$500, $100, $50, or $30\\". Carrier wrote the \\"seed faith\\" request included anonymous letters linking donations to new personal wealth, which was a way for Stewart to increase donations his organization receives. Stewart produces many DVDs and \\"healing packages\\" in addition to his three books. His most recent book is from 2007 titled Healing: The Brain Soul Connection with Daniel Amen. In the book, Stewart says he has ADD and has a special interest in helping those mental and emotional difficulties. He also wrote Only Believe, a history of the early Latter Rain Movement that includes Oral Roberts, Kathryn Kuhlman, A. A. Allen and Benny Hinn. The Don Stewart Association sells many books, DVDs, and \\"healing/miracle\\" packages. Stewart's faith healing services include live video streaming, live email testimonies and prayer requests, and cell phone prayer. In May 2009, The Arizona Republic examined 22 charities tied to the Don Stewart Association, which claim to be independent, but with links via association employees, pastors, and their wives, parents, children and in-laws operated 16 of the 22 charities from tax years 2003 to 2005. The paper revealed Stewart's association spent the bulk of its money on salaries and expenses such as a Hummer H2 and $80,000 for a tract of farmland in Montana, purchased from the family of a hunger charity's president. Later that month Arizona's attorney general's office began reviewing its practices to decide whether any action should be taken. Following the report in September 2009, The Arizona Republic reported St. Mary's Food Bank Alliance in Phoenix broke contact with Northern Arizona Food Bank and the Stewart Association was being investigated by the federal government. The Don Stewart Association would no longer comment to The Republic.

It belongs to the sidecar family, made with gin in place of brandy. The cocktail sometimes also includes additional ingredients, for example egg white, sugar, or cream. The classic concoction is most commonly served in a Martini cocktail glass. When an egg white is added a champagne coupe is preferable; the silky foam clings more pleasingly to the curved glass. Origin The original recipe for the White Lady was devised by Harry MacElhone in 1919 at Ciro's Club in London. He originally used cr√®me de menthe, but replaced it with gin at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1929. According to the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel, the drink was created there by Harry Craddock. History A recipe for the White Lady made with gin, Cointreau, and fresh lemon juice appears in the Savoy Cocktail Book, published in 1930.101 cocktails that shook the world: #5: The White Lady Independent, The (London) Find Articles at BNET.com Joe Gilmore, former Head Barman at The Savoy, says this was one of Laurel and Hardy's favorite drinks.The Savoy: Checking into History\\" Channel 4 TV UK Early recipes like MacElhone's and Craddock's don't have egg white as one of the recorded ingredients. Comparison with gin sour While sours are characterized by a bright acidity, sidecars are often drier, since they are made with liqueurs (in this case Cointreau) instead of sugar. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness. In popular culture In John le Carr√©'s 1965 novel The Looking Glass War, British spy and main protagonist Fred Leiser's favorite drink is a White Lady, and he makes several attempts to get other agents to try the cocktail. In Dorothy Sayers' mystery novel Have His Carcase, Lord Peter has a White Lady when he hears about his \\"Lady\\" Miss Harriet Vane being in trouble again. It is mentioned in the novel Islands in the Stream by Ernest Hemingway.

During the recording sessions for the album, the chronically shy and withdrawn songwriter formed a friendship and a mentorship of sorts with producer Joe Boyd, an early supporter of Drake. Boyd saw commercial potential in the acoustic and unaccompanied demo version of the song, and recruited former Velvet Underground member John Cale as producer. Cale added piano, organ and celesta arrangements, initially against Drake's wishes.Cale, John. What's Welsh for Zen. Bloomsbury, 2000. The song marked a strong redirection in Drake's sound. He was pleased with Cale's production, and anticipated that the song would be his commercially successful break through. However, Island Records decided against releasing it as a single, and the accompanying album, like its predecessor, did not receive marketing support, and so failed to sell. Having tried lush arrangements, Drake's following album Pink Moon is characterised by bleak vocals and sparse guitar parts, but again only received limited release. In the 1980s \\"Northern Sky\\" became pivotal in resurrecting interest in Drake's music until then had been largely forgotten. Biographer Patrick Humphries describes the song as \\"the finest ... to which Nick Drake ever lent his name. Again sounding alone and vulnerable ... he pleads for the brightness to come.\\"Humphries, p. 115 Composition and arrangement ‚ÄúNorthern Sky‚Äù is written in Drake's favoured DADGDG tuning, with a middle eight composed by Cale during the recording. The accompaniment by the classically trained Cale reflects Drake's desire to move away from the pastoral sound of his 1969 debut album Five Leaves Left, which was a commercial failure. Cale's own career was similarly in tatters; he had been fired from the Velvets by Lou Reed two years earlier, and was yet to re- establish his reputation as a formidable producer. Drake sought to broaden his own appeal and tentatively agreed to Boyd's suggestion to include bass and drum tracks on recordings for Bryter Layter, and to experiment with a more pop or jazzy sound, which Boyd admitted he imagined would be \\"more commercial\\".Dann (2006), p. 142 Yet it essentially retains Drake's original acoustic style, being anchored by long term producers and arrangers Robert Kirby and John Wood's sharp and stripped-down sparse engineering and production values. Trevor Dann believes that the contrasting approach of the two men produced accompaniment that is \\"opulent without overpowering the fragile little song\\".Dann, p. 242 The song was probably written during Drake's brief period of living in Hastings with John Martyn and his wife Beverley.Dann, p. 243 According to Beverley Martyn, \\"He wrote that one around us. We had a tree in the garden across the pavement ‚Äì hence the line, 'Smelt sweet breezes at the top of a tree.' The top of the tree came to the window where Nick was, and you could see the full moon on the sea at night.\\" There has been speculation as for whom the song was written, with Linda Thompson as the most often mentioned candidate. There is no real evidence for this however, and he was at the time friendly with a number of women. He had platonic friendships with both Sophia Ryde and Beverly Martyn, with whom he was particularly close, although neither of these relationships developed. Dann speculates that the song may have been inspired by Drake's enthusiasm for hashish, a drug which the songwriter was using, according to close associates, to insulate himself from the world around him. Although he does not appear to have developed his drug habit further, it has been suggested that his tastes developed after his contact with Cale, who was struggling with a heroin habit. After Bryter Layter failed to sell, Drake rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional poorly-attended concert or to buy drugs.Dann (2006), p. 157 Boyd was at the time working as co-producer with John Cale on Nico's Desertshore album. Boyd sent the recently ex-Velvet Underground member a demo recording of a few of the tracks that were to form Bryter Layter.Dann, p. 143 The morning Cale received them, he rang Boyd asking \\"Who the fuck *is* this guy? I have to meet him, where is he right now.\\" He described his first impressions after meeting Drake as of \\"a very quiet guy. It was very difficult to figure what was going on in his mind. He made music with a real sensuality ‚Äì very different from English folk music\\".Dann, p. 144 Boyd phoned Drake, and was given consent ‚Äì Boyd claims Drake's only words during the conversation were \\"Oh, uh, OK\\". He arranged a recording session for the following day, on the condition that Cale would be allowed to add accompaniment to the tracks. That morning, with Wood and Kirby engineering and assisting, they recorded \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Cale improvised piano, celeste, and Hammond organ parts on \\"Northern Sky\\", and viola and harpsichord arrangements on \\"Fly\\". In his 2006 biography of Drake, Trevor Dann describes Cale's contribution as infusing the tracks with a \\"subtlety that Robert Kirby's full-blown arrangements didn't quite match on some of the other tracks [on Bryter Layter]. Boyd noticed Cale was strongly leading the direction of the recording, but that as the songs were reforming, Drake gradually seemed to gain trust in his judgment. During the session he asked the songwriter if he was happy with the direction the songs were taking, and was met with an affirmative \\"Yeh, yeh, I guess so yeh, yeh.\\" Boyd later wrote \\"Despite [Cale's] domineering manner, [he] was very solicitous towards Nick, who seemed to be guardedly enjoying himself: his only choice was to relax and be carried along.\\"Boyd, p. 201 Although Boyd is credited with production, he admits his actual contribution was putting the two men in contact. Reception Although Drake's debut album was commercially unsuccessful, Boyd was able to generate a mood of optimism around the lead-up to the release of Bryter Layter. According to Kirby, Drake was uncharacteristically upbeat. He felt Bryter Layter \\"was going to be the one with a single on it. I always rated \\"Poor Boy\\", but they could have gone with \\"Northern Sky\\", but nothing ever happened.\\"Humphries, p. 116 Patrick Humphries wrote of the song: \\"The atmosphere is dense, suggesting sliver moons sailing on a raven black sea, wind lightly ruffling the hair of the treetops, all stoked by a crazy kind of magic; and the alchemy is fuelled by Cale's hymnal organ and soaring piano figures.\\" Music critic Peter Paphides described it as, \\"the most unabashedly joyful song in his canon.\\" Legacy and cover versions  The 1985 UK hit single \\"Life in a Northern Town\\" by The Dream Academy was based on and inspired by \\"Northern Sky\\", and contributed to the early to mid-80s revival of interest in the songwriter's career. Singer Nick Laird-Clowes's vocals directly echo Drake's style, while the record sleeve contains the words \\"Nick Drake, Steve Reich & Classics For Pleasure\\". Drake, then practically unknown in the UK, was name-checked in a Melody Maker interview with Laird-Clowes, who said his song came of a \\"strong connection with Nick Drake in a way I can't even explain\\".Dann, p. 197 As a result of this, the BBC began to field requests for Drake's song, while Nick Stewart, head of A&R; at Island Records, pitched to the label that the songwriter's catalogue might then be ideally placed for re-issue to the then developing adult CD market. The song was issued as a promotional CD maxi-single for the 1994 compilation album Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake. In 2004 the NME described the song as the \\"greatest English love song of modern times\\". The song appears on the 2005 compilation album Anthems in Eden: An Anthology of British & Irish Folk 1955‚Äì1978, and in the closing scene of the 2001 film Serendipity. After winning the UK television talent show Stars in Their Eyes singing as Dusty Springfield, Emma Wilkinson included a cover version of \\"Northern Sky\\" on her 2002 Son of a Preacher Man album.

Early life His brother is comedian and YouTuber Jay Foreman, with whom he sometimes collaborates onstage. After studying at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School for Boys, Barnet, Foreman moved to Brighton in 2001 to study at the University of Sussex. Although he started making noises at the age of three by imitating Michael Winslow from the Police Academy movie series, it was seeing Rahzel perform live that convinced Foreman that beatboxing could sustain a whole show rather than simply provide interludes within the context of a broader presentation. Beardyman's first musical venture was composing a symphony for his school orchestra at the age of ten. At fifteen, an introduction to drum and bass led to his long-standing obsession with music technology. Darren was given the nickname \\"Beardyman\\" because a name was quickly needed for a flyer for an early show, and he had a beard at the time. Career Musical style In 2006 Beardyman battled to become UK Beatbox Champion and retained his title in 2007 making him the first beatboxer in UK history to win two championships in a row. He was on the 2008 judging panel. Already an accomplished solo beatboxer in the modern tradition, Beardyman was further inspired by MC Xander to use music technology such as the Korg Kaoss Pad 3 to loop and sample his vocals. Through his use of loop pedals and effects tools, he effectively produces whole DJ sets via live production‚Äîentire sets where the songs (both covers of well-known hits and his own original material) are constructed, live, from his vocalizations. His music frequently contains elements of drum and bass, dubstep, breakbeat, trance, techno and other associated forms of electronic dance music. He also incorporates other forms of music into his live sets, including but not limited to reggae and country music, often purely for the purpose of providing a comedic counterpoint to his beatboxing. Virtually all of his music is created using only his mouth and vocal cords to produce sounds, and incorporating music technology such as vocoders and software synthesis to alter the pitch of his voice, or to add various kinds of audio effects such as delays, reverbs or modulation effects. In various YouTube videos various pieces of electronic equipment can be spotted, notably the Korg Kaossilator Pro, the Kaoss Pad 3 (also known as the KP3), a Korg Wavedrum, a microKORG, a Boss GT-8 and a Boss RC-50. In a departure from his prior live work, Beardyman released his debut album I Done a Album on 21 March 2011. Beardyman performs You Only Like What You Know using the Beardytron 5000 MkII software, 2 September 2013 As of 2012 he has foregone the usage of Kaoss Pads in favour of proprietary software he has been developing, currently known as the Beardytron 5000 MkII. \\"Over the past 3 years I have worked tirelessly on the system, overseeing its development and testing, improving and configuring it. I had no choice really, as the shows I want to do are simply not possible using any existing off the shelf gear, existing software or even cobbled together patches using freeware. The system is essentially my life's work and will continue to be what I use for all my future endeavours. The Beardytron 5000 mkII is a work in progress and at some point you'll be able to buy some form of looper/production-system based on the innovations developed to make my shows possible.\\" Beardyman further states: \\"The system is built from the ground up in C++ and Objective-C by Dave Gamble of DMGAudio and employs 15 instances and counting of a partly bespoke version of Sugarbytes' incredible linear-8-way-morph-engine controlled multi-effect 'Turnado'. Guitar rig is also used along with Rob Papen's delay. The system is controlled using two iPads running bespoke programs using a specially developed high definition, self-reconnecting protocol.\\" On 29 November 2012 Beardyman posted a live gig performed in October 2012 in Pune, India, which was the first live gig audio revealed online to solely use the Beardytron 5000 MkII. He has stated that the software for the Beardytron 5000 MkII will be available to purchase by the public sometime in 2014. On 28 February 2013, Beardyman gave a talk at a TED conference, an 11-minute overview and demonstration of the Beardytron 5000 MkII. Before demonstrating the capabilities of the Beardytron 5000, he provides an example of some of the sounds he is capable of making with only his vocal cords, such as crying babies, vinyl record scratching, buzzing flies, overtone singing, various animals, a didgeridoo and beatboxing. He then explains that despite his ability to create sounds, the human voice is still intrinsically limited by its physical and biological characteristics. He describes his invention as a real-time music production machine. He states: \\"It enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head, unimpeded by any physical restrictions my body might place on me.\\" The video was uploaded to the TED.com website, the TEDTalks YouTube channel and Beardyman's website on 2 August 2013. Collaborators Beardyman performing on his Kaoss Pads, July 2011 His interest in exploring new musical technology is also evident in the innovative Battlejam club nights he hosts with 2007 DMC champion turntablist JFB. Here the live looping technology is augmented with live sampling of the audience to make the hook of instantly composed tracks and even live video sampling and scratching. He has gigged and recorded with MC Klumzy Tung as part of MC/beatbox duo The Gobfathers. Together, they presented Get Lucky TV's 'The Freestyle Show\\" in 2005, and also appeared as traffic wardens in a hidden camera show for E4. In 2008 he collaborated with visual artist mr hopkinson, to produce a video called Monkey Jazz which visually describes the live looping process, which has had over 1 million views on YouTube. Since then they have worked together to produce various multi-camera videos of Beardyman's performances filmed at the Cube Microplex. Beardyman has also appeared on stage for improvised live shows with mr_hopkinson providing visual backdrops from images instantly searched from the internet in response to audience suggestions at Just for Laughs Montreal and Edinburgh Fringe international comedy festivals, sourcing and manipulating images live from the internet in response to audience suggestions. Viral videos Beardyman often incorporates humour into his act. He has impersonated Elvis, dressed as a monkey on stage at BestivalBeardyman Interview and once posed as an Austrian climate change lecturer, \\"Professor Bernhard Steinerhoff\\", before breaking into his set, with over 2 million views on YouTube. He also features in the Funky Sage ring tones in which he plays a floating head who beatboxes and gives good advice. His video \\"Kitchen Diaries\\" which features him combining beatboxing with cooking has been viewed more than 5 million times on YouTube. \\"Kitchen Diaries\\" also makes an appearance in 'South Coast', a Brighton-based documentary about hip hop in the UK. Beardyman, September 2009 Vocal abilities Beardyman is known for his eclectic array of vocal techniques which include beatboxing, singing, rapping, overtone singing, scat singing, instrument/sound mimcry and voice impressions. Media appearances During November 2006 he took part in a series of children's choir charity concerts called Young Voices appearing in Manchester, Birmingham, London and Belfast. On 10 February 2007 he made an appearance on the second episode of the BBC One show When Will I Be Famous. Despite winning over the studio audience and two of the three judges, he came second in a public vote. On the same day, he was on also on the Channel 4 show Homemade where he was profiled as the weirdest beatboxer around. Beardyman supported Groove Armada on their UK tour in 2007. In July 2009, he appeared at the Udderbelly during its residency at South Bank in London. This was for an ensemble comedy show called \\"Beardyman's Complete and Utter Shambles\\" featuring JFB, MC Klumzy Tung, Beardyman's comedian brother Jay Foreman, visual artist mr_hopkinson, guitarist 'J'm Black, saxophonist Hellanor and comedian Reggie Watts. The show took the technology based entertainment experiments of Battlejam to a more theatrical comedy club setting. A reduced cast version of the show renamed \\"Beardyman's Unplanned Explosion\\" went on to appear at the Udderbelly at the Edinburgh Festival in late August 2009, and again at Bristol Old Vic in October 2009. Beardyman appeared in the BBC Comedy Prom 2011 with Tim Minchin. Beardyman cites the Lyrebird as a form of inspiration, and hosted a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the bird entitled, \\"Beardyman and the Mimics\\". He regularly appears on the BBC Radio 4 Now Show and was a guest panelist on Series 18, Episode 5 of The Infinite Monkey Cage.

He is a former member of L.A. Symphony. Early life Pigeon John claims that his stage name was provided by Jesus who was driving around Inglewood: \\"He hopped out and handed me a dead pigeon. He whispered, 'Please have a good time, you're really bumming me out.' I watched him sink back into the cushioned seats and drive, quickly away. And that's when it happened, the pigeon started shaking violently and became awake, picked up and flew away. I don't think I had a choice... it was 'pigeon' or die.\\" He later explained that he was discussing his need for a stage name with a friend when the friend suggested \\"Chicken John\\", taken from the character Chicken George in Roots. The friend's mother then interjected that John didn't look like a chicken, claiming that he looked like a pigeon and should therefore be called \\"Pigeon John\\". Career In the early 1990s, Pigeon John and his childhood friend B-Twice formed the hip-hop duo Brainwash Projects. Brainwash Projects contributed the single \\"Muchas Muchachas\\" to the Christian rap compilation \\"Sanktifunctafyd\\" released by N-Soul Records in 1995. Brainwash Projects eventually released a record titled The Rise and Fall of Brainwash Projects on the independent label Jackson Rubio.\\"the rise and fall of the BRAINWASH PROJECTS\\". Published by Jackson Rubio. Available through the Internet Archive. One reviewer characterized The Rise and Fall as \\"pure, uncut, holy hip-hop\\" but gave mixed reviews of its beats and lyrics. Between 1997 and 2000, Pigeon John recorded the songs that became his first solo album, Is Clueless. The album was released in 2001 by The Telephone Company and then re-released in 2002 by The Telephone Company/Syntax Records with three new tracks and new artwork. Pigeon John then signed to Basement Records and released Is Dating Your Sister (2003) and Pigeon John Sings the Blues (2005). In 2005, Lyrics Born saw Pigeon John on the Cali Comm Tour and brought him into Quannum Projects. That same year, Pigeon John's single \\"Deception\\" was featured on a series of Nestle Crunch commercials. In 2006, after signing to Quannum, Pigeon John released his fourth solo album, And the Summertime Pool Party. The album has received positive reviews from many sources, including LA Weekly, Entertainment Weekly,and Vibe. A new album, entitled Dragon Slayer, hit physical and digital retail October 12, 2010. With the aid of General Elektriks' Herve Salters, he produced the whole record, including, for the first time, sampling original instrumentation rather than flipping samples from records. A single from the album, The Bomb, was used to promote the premiere of the Cartoon Network live-action TV film Level Up in late 2011. In 2014, he released an album titled Encino Man. In 2019, he released \\"They Don't Make Em Like Me\\" as a single. The song was included in the official Motorola Razr advertisement.

J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Synopsis Mr. and Mrs. Wranglebury quarrel like two tigers whenever they are together. Things come to a head when Mrs. Wranglebury's mother comes unexpectedly to stay with them. Mr. Wranglebury borrowed money from his mother-in-law many years ago to start his business, and he is fearful that she may ask for it back. They pretend to be very amiable and discover that they really prefer being amiable to each other and want to live happily together. When the servant Jane nearly spoils everything by telling the mother-in-law of the quarrels, she is branded a liar and sacked on the spot.

Lalor's writings were to exert a seminal influence on later Irish leaders such as Michael Davitt, James Connolly, P√°draig Pearse, and Arthur Griffith.Thomas P. O'Neill, James Fintan Lalor, Golden Publications, Dublin, Early life Richard Lalor James Fintan Lalor was born in Tinnakill House (Fintan Lalor always referred to his birthplace as Tenakill), Raheen, County Laois (known at the time as Queen's County) on 10 March 1807. The first son of Patrick \\"Patt\\" Lalor and Anne Dillon (daughter of Patrick Dillon of Sheane near Maryborough). Patrick and Anna were to have twelve children. Patrick was to become the first Catholic M.P. for Laois in 1832 - 1835, and was to lead a campaign of passive resistance to the payment tithes. Patrick was to out live his eldest son by six years, dying in 1856, and his mother Anna was to die in 1835, the same year as his brother Joseph. James was, according to Tom√°s √ì N√©ill one of his biographers, a fine healthy baby when born, but as the result of an accident as an infant, was left semi-crippled. Though small for his age, being both pale and delicate, James was to display unexpected strength of body. Though hardy enough he was never sent to school, having private tuition at home instead. This was to continue up until he was seventeen, when it was then decided that he should go to college. St Patrick's, Carlow College In February 1825 he went to St. Patrick's, Carlow College, the Vice-President of which, Father William Kinsella, was to go on to become the bishop of Ossory. It was Father William himself who welcomed James to the college and introduced him to Maurice Lenihan, who was to be his advisor and guardian. In College James studied both chemistry, under a Mr. Holt and the classics under Father Andrew Fitzgerald. While in college he became a member of the Apollo Society, were literature and music were studied, his favourite author at the time being Lord Bolingbroke. In college one of the great influences on James was Bishop James Doyle. In the controversies over tithes, education and the freedom of religion Dr. Doyle, writing under the pen name J.K.L, was considered very influential. An atmosphere of patriotism in the college was encouraged, and this was shown later, not just in James Fintan's later life, but in that of students such as John O'Leary, Richard D'Alton Williams and Maurice Leyne. While in college James worked hard and learnt the basics and principles not just of chemistry but law also. This understanding of law, Tom√°s √ì N√©ill suggests became evident from his writings later on. He suffered greatly through ill health during his time in college, and in February 1826, being ill and very weak he had to return home. After College Not much is known about James after he left college, most information being based on oral tradition. One suggestion is that he became an apprentice to a Dr. John Jacob, who worked in Portlaoise county hospital. In the June 1827 Dr. Jacob died and was replaced by his son who was a young medical student. The suggestion is that they did not get on and James left the hospital. Another account put forward for this period is that he left the hospital because of a \\"disappointment in love.‚Äù It is then suggested that James intended to sail to France. Tom√°s √ì N√©ill is fairly certain that James never went to France, and points to the fact that there is no reference to it in James later writings. Daniel O'Connell However, in T. F. O‚ÄôSullivan, account of his life, in The Young Irelanders, states that he did in fact go and lived there for a couple of years, being supplied with money by his mother.T. F. O‚ÄôSullivan, The Young Irelanders, The Kerryman Ltd. 1945. What is known though, is that there is no real definite account at all about him for several years. Tithe Campaign Catholic Emancipation had been granted in 1829, and according to Patrick Lalor, Catholics would never be fully free while the burden of a foreign faith was on them in the form of tithes. Supported by his family, Patrick at a public meeting in Portlaoise, said he intended to give up paying tithes to a foreign faith. As a result of this declaration, Arthur Moore Mosse, who was the secretary of the Grand Jury, asked Patrick to call off his campaign offering to give him a receipt for the year's tithe, but this he refused. Mosse then offered him a receipt that would free him from tithes for the rest of his life, and this was also refused. Shortly after, the proctor seized twenty of the brothers' sheep, but they got replevin and the sheep had to be returned. When the sheep had to be sold the family painted \\"Tithe\\" on them, which meant no-one would buy them. On the way to Smithfield market in Dublin no-one would offer any help to the drovers. In Dublin the only bid for them was from the steward of the Rev. John Latouch, a Mr. Brough. It was Latouch who had sent the proctor to the Lalors in the first place. As a result of this the sheep had to be placed on a boat for Liverpool, but even there no-one would bid for them, so they were then driven to Manchester and then to Leeds: most died on the road. The Lalor brothers had through their father become politically active. (The Tithe War had started according to O'Neill, but it would be some time before it would end.) Politics John Blake Dillon Politics began to play an important part in the life of the Lalor family. In 1832 Patrick Lalor, was called to give evidence before a Select Committee, having been recognised as one of the leaders in Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association. Founding himself the Laois Liberal Club, which was in later year's part of the election machinery for Parnell. During the elections of this year, Patrick was to come in ahead of Sir Charles Coote, the Tory Party candidate winning the seat, and this was seen as a major victory to the cause. During the campaign the Tory paper, the Leinster Express, attempted to destroy Patrick's character, claiming he himself was a tyrant. Patrick was in 1835 to lose his seat to Thomas Vesey, the son of Lord Vesey. Lord Vesey during the election compelled his tenants to vote against their conscience, and those who did not were evicted from their holdings. Around this time there were a number of secret societies in Ireland. With names such as the Blackfeet, Whitefeet and the Terryalts. These groups originated from the Whiteboys of the previous generation. It was these groups who reacted to these type of evictions. James was of the view the root of the problem lay not with the societies but with the power of the landlords to evict tenants. Lalor's great friend at this time was John Marnell, also the son of a farmer, and he too shared Lalor's views. It was the issue of land and the ownership of land which was to shape the rest of James Fintan Lalor's life. Temperance and The Shamrock Friendly Society Theobald Mathew In 1838 Father Mathew, the temperance priest, began his campaign. In just a year or two of starting this campaign millions were to give up alcohol. One such society was formed in Raheen and Fintan Lalor became a member. In the November 1840 he then proposed that the Society should become an association and that it should have additional aims also. This was agreed and the name was changed to The Shamrock Friendly Society. In this Society they planned to organise free legal aid to help the poor, as well as organise reading and promote healthy games. In addition to the Society, Fintan Lalor was influenced by a group of agrarian reformers in his native county. They were led by William Conner, who suggested a scheme for arbitration on rents and fixity of tenure for tenant farmers. Conner's suggestions were to find few supporters, but Fintan Lalor was one of them. He became closely associated with Conner and spent weeks at his house near Athy. He also attended Conner's public meetings which were held in various parts of Kildare and Laois.Leaders and Workers, Edited by J. W. Boyle, Mercier Press, Dublin, 1978, Conner was finally charged with making a seditious speech at Mountmellick in 1841 for which he received a sentence of six months‚Äô imprisonment. As a result of his activities Conner was expelled from the Repeal Association because he proposed that Repealers should not pay rent, county cess, rent charge, tithe poor rate or any other charge arising out of land until repeal was granted. Fintan Lalor agreed with Conner and it was at this stage that his political differences with his Father really began. Repeal Association Thomas Davis In 1840 Daniel O'Connell split with the Whigs and re-established the Repeal Association as a separate parliamentary entity. While support for another one of O'Connell's associations was slow to start, with the adhesion of both Thomas Davis and John Blake Dillon the Association was to quickly developed. James was totally opposed to both O'Connell and the Association. He thought O'Connell's whole policy was flawed, and wrote a letter to Robert Peel the head of government, calling for it to be suppressed. See Full text here: s:Letter to Robert Peel calling for Repeal to be suppressed This opinion of O‚ÄôConnell was to cause a rift to develop between Fintan Lalor and his father, who much admired O‚ÄôConnell. The final event being an article Fintan Lalor was to write in January 1844 about the aims of the Irish agricultural Society. As a result of this their relationship was to break down completely, and Fintan Lalor was obliged to leave home. Dublin and Belfast Having left home Fintan Lalor headed to Dublin. While in the capitol his health deteriorated and was to break down completely. Thomas Brady attended to him, and treated him for a chest complaint. Based on the medication proscribed, O‚ÄôNeill suggests that it seems likely that what he was suffering from was tuberculosis. Fintan Lalor was to never fully recover from this episode. When his father found out about his sons condition, he sent money to help him out. Though he could have returned home at this time, he went instead to look for employment. His friend John Marnell introduced him to William Blood, who ran a bank come pawn shop, were the poor could get loans at reasonable rates. Fintan Lalor then went to Belfast to learn more about this from a similar establishment run by a Father James Finn. He took ill again, at one stage vomiting blood, and on the advice of his family and friends was urged returned home to Tenakill. He wrote to his father and apologized for his many faults. As a result, the bonds between the two were mended. Fintan Lalor, did not return home though, instead staying in the city and attempted to find employment. But his health was again to break down and at last he was forced to return home. By March 1846, he was back with his family in Tenakill. The Nation The Great Irish Famine led him into direct action: he attempted to found tenant-right societies and organise rent strikes. John Mitchel On 11 January 1847, Fintan Lalor began to publish a series of \\"stirring and controversial letters and articles to newspapers such as The Felon and The Nation\\". Writing from Tenakill, his family home, Fintan Lalor put forward his views on current affairs and in particularly on land reform. His manner and style of writing quickly caught the attention of both its readers and staff. T. F. O‚ÄôSullivan commented that ‚Äúthe journal realise that a new force had arisen in the political world.‚Äù In the first letter, Fintan Lalor stated that contrasted with the question of the land, Repeal ‚Äúwas a petty, parish question.‚Äù On this he was quite emphatic ‚ÄúI will never contribute one shilling, or give my name, heart or hand for such an object as the simple Repeal.‚Äù Young Ireland, T. F. O‚ÄôSullivan, The Kerryman Ltd, 1945. Commenting on the Irish Confederation, which was about to be formed he advocated that its policy should be one of ‚Äúnational independence.‚Äù He then proceeded to outline the policy he would approve on obtaining independence, ‚Äúin what form of words you please; but denounce nothing‚Äîproscribe nothing, more especially of your own freedom of action. Leave yourselves free individually and collectively.‚Äù He continued ‚Äúif any resolution, or pledge, be adopted to seek Legislative independence by moral force and legal proceedings alone, with a denunciation, or renunciation of all or any other means or proceedings, you may have millions better and stronger men than I to join you; but you won‚Äôt have me. . . . There has already, I think, been too much giving in on this question of means and force.‚Äù He wrote again another letter on 19 April on the association between landowner and occupiers. Addressing himself to the landlords Fintan Lalor stated that ‚ÄúIreland demanded more than her present dole of bread‚Ä¶ Her demand was for a new Constitution‚Ä¶‚Äù In his third letter titled ‚ÄúTenants‚Äô Rights‚Äù and ‚ÄúLandlord Law,‚Äù he addressed the subject of the famine. ‚ÄúFamine, more or less, was in 500,000 families‚Äîfamine with all its diseases and decay; famine, with all its fears and horrors; famine, with all its dreadful pains and more dreadful debility. All pined and wasted, sickened and drooped; numbers died‚Äîthe strong man, the fair maiden, the infant‚Äîthe landlord got his rent‚Ä¶ The 8,000 individuals who are owners of Ireland by divine right and the grant of God, confirm (by themselves) in sundry successive acts of parliament have a full view of these coming results [i.e. Ireland would become a pasture ground once gain. and its agricultural population would decay or vanish and become extinct at once] and have distinctly declared their intention of serving notice to quit on the people of Ireland‚Ä¶The landlords have adopted the process of depopulating the island and are pressing it forward to their own destruction, or to ours‚Ä¶‚Äù Fintan Lalor's view was that the Landlords were ‚Äúenforcing self-defence on us.‚Äù In the September 1847, Fintan Lalor, along with Michael Doheny, organised at Holycross, in County Tipperary, for the purpose of putting forward his views on land reform. The meeting was failed to produce the results he wanted. Lacking both eloquence as a public speaker, and his weak state of health also rendered him unfit to conduct a public campaign. The Irish Felon John Mitchel one of the Confederation leaders, was very impressed by Lalor's views on land reform, and in a letter to William Smith O'Brien himself the leader of the Confederation, said of him ‚ÄúMr. Lalor, ‚Ä¶does not now go for the whole of his system, but contemplates violent pressure on the landlords of those districts to coerce them into a fair settlement of the tenure question; the coercion to take the form of non-payment to such landlords as hold out.‚Äù A policy Mitchel was later to adopt. John Martin (1812-1875) Having failed to rouse the farmers, Lalor retired again to Tenakill, and it was not till the June 1848, that he again took to the public stage. He cooperated with John Martin in writing for The Irish Felon which started on June 4, 1848. The publication of the Felon was in response to the suppression of John Mitchel's United Irishman, and the transportation of Mitchel. Among some of the titles were ‚ÄúWhat must be Done,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Faith of a Felon,‚Äù ‚ÄúResistance,‚Äù his final one being ‚ÄúClearing Decks,‚Äù on 22 July 1848. T. F. O‚ÄôSullivan was to describe Fintan Lalor writing as ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù of which three were included later in the indictment against, Martin for Treason Felony. Fintan Lalor responding to the indictment wrote to the Under Secretary, and took responsibility for the articles, and asked that the charges against Martin be dropped, stating that he would take responsibility. This was refused and Martin was, like Mitchel transported. This prompted the following response from Fintan Lalor thumb|right|The inscription reads: In dear memory of James Fintan Lalor born on the 10th of March 1809 and died on 27 December 1849. A faithful Irishman who gave his life in the pursuit of freedom of our country and to improve the state of Irish people in their native land. May his soul be at the right hand of God, (The stone was erected by National Graves Association (1933)) ‚ÄúThe rights of property may be pleaded. No one has more respect for the than I have; but I do class among them the robber‚Äôs right by which the lands of this country are now held in fee for the British Crown. I acknowledge no right of property in a small class which goes to abrogate the rights of a numerous people‚Ä¶ I deny and challenge all such rights, howsoever founded or enforced. I challenge them as founded only on the code of the brigand, and enforced only by the sanction of the hangman.‚Äù In another letter in the Irish Felon titled ‚ÄúThe First Step‚ÄîThe Felon Club,‚Äù which was published on 1 July, Lalor addressing the Government wrote ‚ÄúWe hold the present existing government of this island and all existing rights of property in our soil, to be mere usurpation and tyranny, and to be null and void as of moral effect; and our purpose is to abolish them entirely, or lose our lives in the attempt. The right founded on conquest and affirmed by laws made by the conquerors themselves, we regard as no other than the right of the robber on a larger scale. We owe no obedience to laws enacted by another nation without our consent, nor respect to assumed rights of property which are starving and exterminating our people‚Ä¶‚Äù Outlining his intentions he wrote ‚ÄúWe have determined to set about creating, as speedily as possible, a military organisation, of which the Felons office shall be the centre and citadel. As a first step of proceeding, we are now founding a Club which, it is intended, shall consist of one, two or more persons from each parish throughout Ireland who are to be in immediate connection and correspondence with this office. . . . A prospectus and set of rules are in preparation, which we will publish when completed. But without waiting for such publication, we earnestly request every man in Ireland who desires to enrol himself as a colleague and comrade, and as a member of the Felon Club, will signify his wish by letter to the provisional secretary, Mr. Joseph Brenan, Felon office, 12 Trinity Street.‚Äù In his last article for the Irish Felon ‚ÄúClearing Decks,‚Äù Lalor wrote ‚Äî‚ÄúRemember this‚Äîthat somewhere and somehow, and by somebody, a beginning must be made. Who strikes the first blow for Ireland? Who draws first blood for Ireland? Who wins a wreath that will be green forever?‚Äù Arrest and Rising David Lawlor with bronze statue of James Fintan Lalor Six days later Lalor was arrested under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and kept in prison for some months, after which he was released owing to the bad health which had been affected by his imprisonment. ‚ÄúHis spirit, however, was undaunted,‚Äù according to O‚ÄôSullivan, and in the following year he set about organising a revival of the insurrection‚Äù in co-operation with John Savage, Joseph Brennan, John O'Leary and Thomas Clarke Luby in Tipperary and Waterford. At Cappoquin, in September, Savage and Brenan attacked the police barracks but the other leaders had not sufficient forces at their command to take aggressive action in the districts in which they were working, and the insurgents had to separate. Three months afterwards, on 27 December 1849, Lalor died in his 43rd year, as a result of an attack of bronchitis, and was buried in Glasnevin. Legacy The James Fintan Lawlor Commemorative Committee, chaired by David Lawlor was formed in August 2005 to erect a memorial to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of James Fintan Lalor. ‚Ç¨110,000 was raised; Laois County Council provided the site; Irish Life and Permanent sponsored the project; the Department of the Environment provided half the cost. The bronze statue of Lalor holding a pamphlet aloft was sculpted by Mayo-based artist Rory Breslin. The inscription on the limestone plinth reads: Michael Davitt considered Lalor \\"the only real Irish revolutionary mind in the '48 period\\". His ideas were the ideological underpinning of the Irish National League during the Land War. Family Peter Lalor James Fintan's brother Richard Lalor born in 1823, became a Young Irelander who later supported Parnell. He was an M.P for Queen's County from 1880 until 1892. He died in the family home in November 1893. Peter (1827‚Äì1889), James' youngest brother, went to Melbourne in the colony of Victoria, Australia in 1852. In 1854 Peter led immigrant gold miners in an armed uprising at the Eureka Stockade, Ballarat going on to become a Member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly (1856‚Äì1887) and ministerial posts including Speaker in 1880. His cousins included Alice Lalor (1768‚Äì1846), an early American religious leader, Dr Joseph Lalor (1811‚Äì86) an Irish mental health reformer, and Joseph O'Lawlor (1768‚Äì1850) a Spanish general.

Main themes Taken as a whole, the columns were a scathing criticism of the Bush administration, and the Republican party at that time. Krugman argued that the large deficits during that time were generated by the Bush administration as a result of decreasing taxes on the rich, increasing public spending, and fighting the Iraq War. Krugman wrote that these policies were unsustainable in the long run and would eventually generate a major economic crisis.The Economist, 13 November 2003, Paul Krugman, one-handed economistKrugman, Paul, Rolling Stone. 14 December 2006, \\"The Great Wealth Transfer\\" References External links *The Great Unraveling home page Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Books about liberalism Category:Books by Paul Krugman Category:W.

In 1995, his colleagues voted him the best weathercaster in the world.  Early life  He joined the army at the age of 17 and fought in World War II as a paratrooper. After leaving the army a few years later, he received a job with the Transport Department's meteorological branch in 1948. Matheson worked in remote areas as a technician, sampling environmental data until 1954, when a friend told him of a new TV station being built in Lethbridge. He had a popular call-in show on radio called \\"Phone Bill\\" on CJOC in Lethbridge which had a huge local following. He secured a position as the stations' weatherman, despite not owning a television himself. Nonetheless, he remained for almost 20 years. Then, in the 1970s, he was offered a job with ABC in New York. Matheson returned to Alberta after a little under 2 years; local unions failed to convince him to apply for U.S. Citizenship which he would need to continue his employment at ABC.  Return to Canada  He returned to Alberta and joined Edmonton's CJCA radio station, where, partnered with Bill Jackson, he co- hosted the \\"Bill-and-Bill\\" show. Around the time he joined with CJCA, Bill Matheson also joined CITV-TV in Edmonton as its weatherman. Despite advances in technology, Matheson was known for sticking with his felt marker, his weatherboard, and a long pointer which he would bounce on the ground and catch at the end of every forecast. With his flowery language and expressive nature, he earned the \\"Best Weathercaster in the World\\" award in 1995. As well as being a prominent personality at ITV, Matheson enjoyed strong listenership with CJCA and Bill Jackson until the station folded in 1993. At that time, he moved to 630 CHED for a solo show. He became known for his frequent attempts to retire (at least 3 separate times) as well as the format of his show, which allowed callers to call in for any particular reason. Matheson once said that his was the only show where people would call in about the numbers on the back of a pack of Chiclets. Matheson retired from both radio and television in November 1999, and his final forecast on ITV was extravagant. Alongside the regular forecast, there was a quick speech from Matheson, a sendoff from Edmonton Police Pipe and Drum, as well as two fans who managed to sneak into the studio alongside staff and family. After his retirement the studio retired Matheson's board, which was raised to the rafters. Claire Martin often cites Matheson as one of the reasons she went into meteorology in the first place. Though she started off working for Environment Canada, Matheson convinced her to move into television. She became the evening and weekend forecaster in 1996, and upon Matheson's retirement, she became the permanent forecaster before moving to CBC Television in 2005.  Speech  Matheson was well known for his poetic, almost Shakespearean language on air. He widely referred to \\"that most dreaded of all meteorological phenomena, the Siberian High\\" or its counterpart, the \\"Keep your eye on the Idaho High\\". Matheson was also known to say things such as \\"gather ye rosebuds, while ye may\\" to indicate a sudden cooling trend; while storm clouds were called the \\"darkling shadows on the weather map\\".

Motivated largely by political, cultural, and social circumstances, Chin works in a variety of art media to calculate meaning in modern life. Chin places art in landscapes, in public spaces, and in gallery and museum exhibitions, but his work is not limited to specific venues. Chin once stated: ‚ÄúMaking objects and marks is also about making possibilities, making choices‚Äîand that is one of the last freedoms we have. To provide that is one of the functions of art.‚Äù Ned Rifkin. Directions: Mel Chin, February 1- April 23, 1989. Hishorn Museum and Sculpture Garden Brochure, 1989.  Career  See/Saw: The Earthworks, 1976 In 1975, Chin graduated from Peabody College in Nashville, Tennessee. Shortly after, in 1976, Chin created See/Saw: The Earthworks for Hermann Park in Houston, Texas, where the artist manipulated two sections of the park's surface to create a kinetic, minimalist earthwork. In this mimic of a childhood pastime, Chin altered the landscape with an underground hydraulic device that allowed the participants to shift large sections of earth with their body weight. The title also questions psychological perception of what is above and below an object's surface. This piece addressed three of the major art trends of the time: minimalism, conceptualism, and earthworks. 'The Manila Palm', sculpture by Mel Chin, Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, 1978 In 1983, Chin moved to New York City. He created MYRRHA P.I.A. (Post Industrial Age) (1984), site specific to Bryant Park. Commissioned by the Public Art Fund, the work was based on a Gustave Dor√© engraving depicting Myrrha in the 30th canto of Hell from Dante‚Äôs Inferno. Chin created a three-dimensional figurative sculpture employing 19th century fabrication techniques, conjoined with space-age materials. In 1989, Chin had a one-person exhibition at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C. In The Operation of the Sun through the Cult of the Hand (1987), Chin addressed ancient Greek philosophy and Chinese philosophy. He investigated mythological constructions, and scientific information to contradict personal interpretations in the formulations of these works. Chin used nine planets of the solar system to launch this elaborate construction. The installation comments on the origins of word material and form from East and West by drawing upon mythology, alchemy, and science in each culture. Also in this exhibition were three major pieces with political content; The Extraction of Plenty from What Remains: 1823- (1989) is composed of two replicated White House columns that squeeze a cornucopia hand- crafted of mahogany, banana, mud, coffee, and goats‚Äô blood. In this artwork Chin reacted to the long history of American foreign policy that has fractured the ability of Latin American countries to prosper on their own. The date in the title 1823-(ongoing) is in reference to the Monroe Doctrine. The Sigh of the True Cross (1988) is based on a single string Ethiopian masinqo, or spike fiddle. Chin compounds the iconography of the musical instrument and the hammer and sickle to comment on famine, drought, failed politics, and foreign aid in the history of Ethiopia. The Opera of Silence (1988) is also complex and layered with meaning. An oversized Beijing opera drum rests on a staff made of human thigh bone, and the drum skins are woven into the emblem of the C.I.A. commenting on the interrelations of China, Tibet, and the C.I.A.. Chin conceptually developed the GALA Committee for the project called In the Name of the Place. In the Name of the Place covertly inserted art objects on the set of the prime-time television series Melrose Place. Chin claimed, ‚ÄúI realized that somewhere in those industries was where I wanted to develop this conceptual public art project. At the same time I was thinking of the virus as a paradigm for this art project. Viruses are self-replicating, but they mutate, and to me, that's like an art idea. I was wondering, how do you get an idea into a system, and let it replicate within that system? Using the virus as a model, how could I interact with television?‚Äù Tom Finkelpearl.Interview: Mel Chin on Revival Field, in Dialogues in Public Art, Cambridge: The MIT Press, 2000.‚ÄúSyndicated television as a host can serve as a place for the generational transfer of an idea.‚Äù Interview with artist, 2006. The idea to make an impression upon prime time television worked‚Äîand the project successfully placed fine art into popular culture. Sotheby's in Los Angeles auctioned the objects with proceeds going to two educational charities. Degrees of Paradise, 1992 In 1992, Chin created Degrees of Paradise to be shown at the Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York City. Chin commissioned Kurdish weavers to create a 9 foot by 23 foot carpet with patterns based on satellite telemetry. This was installed in the ceiling of one triangular room. In a second similar-shaped room, overhead monitors projected active 3-D mathematically derived cloud patterns. The hand woven Turkish carpet juxtaposed with video monitors continued Chin's commentary of new and old digital traditions by paying homage to both. This project was a precursor to The State of Heaven (not realized). Chin envisioned a massive carpet 66 feet by 66 feet that would represent the entire atmospheric envelope with each knot equating . The carpet was to be destroyed and rewoven in a constant process according to the depletion or accretion of the ozone hole. This was an attempt to make visible a phenomenon that we normally cannot see. After a series of successful gallery and museum exhibits, Chin abandoned object making to pursue an activist, ecological artwork. He began Revival Field in 1990. As a conceptual and scientifically grounded work Revival Field was developed with the intention of green remediation and ecological consciousness. In this landscape art project, Chin, with scientist, Dr Rufus Chaney, used plants called hyperaccumulators that are known for their ability to draw heavy metals from soil. Chin's project was located in the Pig's Eye Landfill in St. Paul, Minnesota for three years. Plot markers were placed to identify the individual plots. Inside them were Zinc, Copper, and Lead, all containing the correct ratios of the amount of metal in the soil. The project was not about the formal configuration but the conceptual realization of scientific process brought forth through art. Other Revival Field sites have been located in Palmerton, Pennsylvania and Stuttgart, Germany. This project materialized science, technology and art, while not adhering to the traditional object making of art. Chin was featured on the PBS series Art:21 - Art in the 21st Century where his pieces S.P.A.W.N. and KNOWMAD and Revival Field were highlighted. In S.P.A.W.N. Chin planned to reclaim abandoned buildings in the city of Detroit, Michigan. He looked at neglected homes that once thrived as a starting point for community development. KNOWMAD explored persecuted cultures and used traditional tribal woven rugs in an interactive computer video game. He developed this project collaboratively with computer software engineers, with the hope of shedding light upon forgotten cultures and forgotten people. In 2008 Chin proposed the idea of CLI- mate (climate linked individual- mate). CLI- mate is an app that is accessible in any language and free for its users. The idea is that it will personalize anyone's relationship with climate change. Users input their daily habits, the app combines their information with every single users and it calculates their impact on the planet. Users will be able to combine their faces with the worlds. The app is missing information on climate changes. In 2004, Mel Chin was invited as a visiting artist at East Tennessee State University. While there, he completed the W.M.D. (\\"Warehouse of Mass Distribution\\"), which was driven to Houston, Texas in May, 2005, to participate in the Houston Art Car Parade. Our Strange Flower of Democracy, 2005 The Station Museum of Contemporary Art held a major exhibition in Houston, Texas (2006) entitled Do Not Ask Me. Prevailing themes that run through the work selected in this exhibition include war, social injustice, modern media, and individuality. Solo exhibitions of Chin's art have appeared the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN, The Menil Collection, Houston, TX, Storefront for Art and Architecture, New York, and The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, PA. In 2006 the Frederieke Taylor Gallery in New York City featured a selection of pieces from the \\"Do Not Ask Me\\" exhibit, originally shown at the Station Museum, as well as new drawings. Chin exhibited \\"KNOWMAD\\" as well as \\"Render\\" at Frederieke Taylor Gallery in 2000 and 2003. 9/11-9/11 (2006) is Chin's first animated film. Based on a graphic novella of the same name, which he wrote in 2002, it is a fictional love story set in Santiago, Chile, 1973 and New York City, 2001. Chin's film deals with the human impact of trauma and tragedy brought forth not by fate but by covert political machinations. Chin is the creator/director working with a 2-D, Chilean animation team. Chin is compelled to make art in spite of his dark world view which is in keeping with his philosophy of ‚Äútaking action as resistance to insignificance.\\" Mel Chin is the recipient of multiple awards including the US National Endowment for the Arts, New York State Council for the Arts, Art Matters, Creative Capital, and the Penny McCall, Pollock/Krasner, Joan Mitchell, Rockefeller and Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundations and Nancy Graves Foundation Award. He was a 2013 Artist-in-Residence at the McColl Center for Art + Innovation in Charlotte, NC.Mel Chin brings The Fundred Project to Charlotte Knight Foundation, October 2, 2012 In 2010 he won a Fellow award granted by United States Artists.United States Artists Official Website Mel Chin has also exhibited in numerous group shows including the Fifth Biennial of Havana, Cuba; Seventh Architectural Biennial in Venice, Italy; Kwangju Biennale, Korea; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington D.C.; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Whitney Museum of American Art; P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center; Museum of Modern Art; and the Asian American Arts Centre, New York City among others. In 2006 Mel Chin visited New Orleans after hurricane Katrina to evaluate with fellow artists creative solutions to cure the aftermath of destruction as result of the storm. Chin began Operation Paydirt to find a solution for the high lead contimination in the soil of New Orleans, a problem that existed before Katrina. To assist the funding of Operation Paydirt, the Fundred Dollar Bill Project was implemented in schools across the United States to symbolically raise 300,000,000 dollars to propose to Congress for an exchange of real dollars in the Summer of 2010. In 2010 Chin received the biennial Fritschy Culture Award from the museum Het Domein, Sittard the Netherlands. \\"The jury praises the unique way in which Chin, in many of his projects, creates a form of art in which participation and other forms of engagement are key. In awarding the Fritschy Culture Award 2010 to Mel Chin, the jury members emphasize the critical engaged nature of this prize and the expression of contemporary global issues.\\"Museum Het Domein, Sittard, Official Website As part of the Fritschy Culture Award, Mel Chin exhibited a solo show at the museum Het Domein, titled \\"Disputed Territories\\". Chin has been included in the Asian American Arts Centre's art Asia America digital archive.

The service operates on the Ffestiniog Railway and the Welsh Highland Railway in North Wales and similar services are operated on the Talyllyn Railway and other heritage railways in the UK. The service was also offered until 1984 by British Railways as successors to the many constituent railway companies that had in 1891 signed an agreement with the G.P.O. and it was BR that regulated the terms and the charges in conjunction with the post office. The service was fully described in the Post Office Guide and the July 1969 edition (August 1969 2nd Supplement) reported that the service was available at stations on British Rail; Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway; Festiniog Railway (summer only); Talyllyn Railway (summer only) and Northern Ireland Railways. Now. with the railways expansion, i.e. operating a longer line, a longer season, and with the reopening of the Welsh Highland line, the service now operates all year round.  FR RLS history  The service originated in 1891 when the FR Co. was party to an agreement on the carriage of Railway Letters made between the G.P.O. and most of the British Railway Companies (operating through the Railway Clearing House). The agreement specifies firstly the conditions under which the service is permitted to operate and secondly the provision of a label (supplied by each participating railway company) to be affixed to the face of the letter. Railway Letters must bear the full G.P.O. Royal Mail First Class Letter Postage as well as the Railway Letter Fee. The agreement, permitting the carriage of letters more quickly than by the normal postal service, became effective nationally on 1 February 1891 and the FR Co. signed the agreement on 28 May 1891. The FR Co. copy survived and was located in 1968 by the Company Archivist, Michael Seymour. The Postmaster General apparently could not confirm the continuing validity of the 1891 agreement, but accepted the copy the FR had, between the FR Co. and the G.P.O., was still valid, and the service was reinstated on 28 May 1969. FR Railway Letter Fee labels (stamps), for the reinstatement of the service, were designed by volunteer Michael Seymour, the FR Co. Archivist (as were all subsequent stamps and pictorial cancellations until his death in February 1999). The stamps, and many later issues, were printed by T. Stephenson & Sons Ltd. Festiniog Railway Letters were initially accepted at the following stations when manned ‚Äì Porthmadog, Dduallt, and Tan-y-bwlch, and also on the trains. A First Day Cover service was introduced and covers were for over thirty years serviced for all G.P.O. Commemorative and Welsh Regional issues as well as for FR issues and special events on the railway. Recently this level of business has been curtailed, as the numbers issued by Royal Mail has increased, and the company has concentrated more on FR stamps and special FR events. This has changed with the expansion on the Welsh Highland line, and other opportunities changes in the postal system brings. It is still operated as a volunteer non profit operation, for the benefit of the company.  General RLS history  Under the Railway Letter Service, a letter could be passed from train to train and railway to railway until it was finally collected at a station, or posted at a station local to the addressee. The original commercial advantage of the scheme rested on it being quicker and more reliable than the ordinary G.P.O. service. Anyone with an important document urgently required elsewhere (usually London) could consult Bradshaw and discover the next train from the local station offering a connection with a train to London (or wherever) and they could then hand in the letter at the local station, secure in the knowledge that the recipient (whom they informed by telephone or telegraph) could collect it on arrival by the specified train. The G.P.O./Royal Mail insisted that the normal postage be paid with Post Office stamps in addition to any railway letter fee and this condition continues. In the late 19th century most British railway companies offered the service and many produced specific railway letter labels (stamps) as required by the agreement. As time went on most companies, including BR, resorted to the use of parcel labels, often with hand written values, or latterly rubber stamps. Until 1974, BR set the Railway Letter Fee (a complex fare structure) and this was often changed without warning or notice. The basic fee was thus increased with immediate effect from 1s. 2d. to 1s. 3d. on 26 May 1969 ‚Äì just two days before the reintroduction of the service on the FR. Fortunately the FR had taken the trouble to provide themselves with 1d, 6d, 1/- and also 1s. 2d. stamps. Extra 1d and a new 1s. 3d. stamps were soon ordered from the printers. The heritage railways, tired of BR frequently upping the charge by a penny, BR had long since given up using priced stamps or labels, sought changes. A new agreement between the Post Office, the Association of Minor Railways, British Rail and Northern Ireland Railways became effective on 3 June 1974. The agreement allowed the minor railways (Association of Independent Railways Ltd) to fix a fee independently of BR. Under the agreement, BR also benefited since it was no longer required to accept letters from a minor railway without the payment of an additional fee. Changing commercial circumstances caused BR to withdraw completely from this nationwide service on 8 June 1984. The Ffestiniog Railway and other heritage railways continued to offer this service. At the insistence of the Royal Mail, a new agreement, a separate contract between the Royal Mail and each participating heritage railway company, was introduced on 18 December 1998.  Collecting  In philatelic circles, these stamps are generally classed as cinderella issues. Examples of early Victorian railway letter fee stamps, and later, are to be seen in the National Philatelic Collection in London. On the first day of the FR‚Äôs reintroduced Railway Letter Service, a railway letter, enclosing sheets of the stamps, was dispatched to H.M. The Queen. A reply was later received, stating that The Queen has been graciously pleased to accept the stamps for inclusion in the Royal Philatelic Collection.

After the fall of Saigon, the UBCV was banned by the communist government, and as one of the senior monks in the organisation, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was at the forefront of the UBCV's defiance of the government, refusing to join the government-endorsed Vietnamese Buddhist Church. He was detained repeatedly by the communist authorities in the last 45 years of his life for his resistance and criticism of their policies, particularly his calls for multi-party democracy. During the Vietnam War period, he also served as a university academic in Buddhism, translated sutras and wrote books, notably a nine-volume Buddhist encyclopedia, and two-volume dictionary between Vietnamese and Sino- Vietnamese. In 2002, he was awarded the Homo Homini Award for human rights activism by the Czech group People In Need, which he shared with his predecessor as patriarch Th√≠ch Huy·ªÅn Quang and Thadeus Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√Ω. He was also awarded the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Life Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was born ƒê·∫∑ng Ph√∫c Tu·ªá in Thanh Chau village in Th√°i B√¨nh Province in northern Vietnam, and became a monk at age 14. During the Vietnamese famine of 1945, he walked for two days from Thanh Sam Temple, where he was training to his home village, where he carried his gravely-malnourished oldest brother from the home to the local temple and nursed him back to health. At age 17 he witnessed his religious master Th√≠ch ƒê·ª©c H·∫£i executed by the revolutionary People's Tribunal. He quoted in open letter to Communist Party Secretary-General Do Muoi in 1994 that \\"Then and there I vowed to do all that I could to combat fanaticism and intolerance and devote my life to the pursuit of justice through the Buddhist teachings of non-violence.\\" In the 1950s, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô travelled to India, Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia to further his Buddhist training and serve as an academic at various universities, spending seven years abroad before returning to Saigon in South Vietnam to teach Buddhism.Taylor, p. 310. He was a professor at the Van Hanh Buddhist University and Saigon University among other institutions in the 1960s and 1970s. He translated various Buddhist texts into Vietnamese and wrote Buddhist textbooks, notably a two-volume Buddhist dictionary between Vietnamese and Sino-Vietnamese, and oversaw a nine-volume Vietnamese language Buddhist encyclopedia. Political opposition While a member of the leadership of the UBCV, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô became an activist, fighting against the anti-Buddhist policies of the Catholic President of South Vietnam Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. After a military raid of Buddhist monasteries in Hue and Saigon, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was arrested on 20 August 1963. He and thousands of other Buddhists endured torture and persecution while imprisoned by the Diem government. He was released after Diem regime was toppled in military coup in November 1963. As a result of imprisonment, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô struggled with tuberculosis before having a lung operation in Japan in 1966. In 1965, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was appointed as the Secretary-General of the Vi·ªán H√≥a ƒê·∫°o (Institute for the Dissemination of Dharma) of the UBCV. In 1975 Vietnam was under communist control, and the UBCV was once again unwelcome in Vietnam. As a result, the UBCV facilities were seized, and documents burned. Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was active in protesting the government's actions, and after attempting to gather Buddhists from other regions in non-violent opposition, he was arrested on charges of 'anti-revolutionary activities' and 'undermining national solidarity'. He spent 20 months at the Phan Dang Luu Prison in solitary confinement in a cell approximately 2m2 in size with a hand-sized window, before he was tried and released in December 1978. Later that year he was nominated by Betty Williams and Mairead Maguire to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1982 the Vietnamese Government created a Buddhist alternative, called the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was state sponsored and controlled by the Vietnam Fatherland Front. Because of Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô's opposition to the new church, he was again jailed. At one meeting of the Vi·ªán H√≥a ƒê·∫°o, he stated to the attendees that 'If you want to pursue glory, then go ahead, but this boat, regardless of whether it is disintegrating, broken or unsteady, let us look after it'. He rejected an approach from the Minister of Public Security Mai Chi Tho to take up a leadership role in the government-backed Buddhist organisation. Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô would spend the next 10 years in exile in the village of Vu Doai, in Thai Binh. His 84-year-old mother was expelled with him, and died in 1985 due to inadequate medical care and malnutrition. In 1992, he returned to the Thanh Minh Pagoda in Saigon. Yet again in 1995, while attempting to send a fax to overseas Buddhists to expose government abuse of the UBCV by obstructing UBCV flood relief effors, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison and a further five years of probation on the grounds of 'undermining the policy of unity and exploiting the rights of freedom to impede the interests of the state'. This led to condemnation by the likes of Nobel laureates the 14th Dalai Lama, Jose Ramos Horta, Mairead Maguire and Francois Jacob, and the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He was released in September 1998 in response to international pressure on the communist government, and returned to Thanh Minh Monastery. In October 2000 he led a delegation of monks to provide relief in An Giang Province in the Mekong Delta but they were detained by communist police before being forced to return to Saigon after being accused of threatening national security. Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô became the President of the UBCV's Institute for the Dissemination of the Dharma in 1999, meaning that he was the second-ranking UBCV dignitary after patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. In February 2001, just before the 9th Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô started a pro-democracy campaign as part of an eight-point program, including free elections as part of a multi-party democracy, trade union membership and 'the abolition of all degrading forms of imported culture and ideologies that pervert Vietnamese spiritual and moral values'. The communist government responded by detaining him, before releasing him in June 2003. In February he published an open letter advocating multi-party democracy and civil rights. He further stated that they were ‚Äúmore important than economic development‚Äù and without them ‚Äúwe cannot make any progress in the real sense.‚Äù In a 2003 interview, he stated \\"People are very afraid of the government ... Only I dare to say what I want to say. That is why they are afraid of me\\". However, he was again detained in October 2003 after an unauthorised UBCV meeting.Taylor, p. 311. He was officially released in 2005, but a UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention reported that he was still effectively under detention. In 2008, as one of his last wishes Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang named Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô as the new patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, a position he would occupy until his death. Upon succeeding Thich Huyen Quang, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô stated that 'The best way to honour our late Patriarch is by putting his words into practice in our daily lives. The Supreme Bicameral Council pledges to do its utmost to re-establish the legal status of the UBCV and maintain its historic tradition of independence'. After 20 years at Thanh Minh, where he remained under continuous surveillance, he returned north to Thai Binh, before returning to Saigon to stay at Tu Hieu Temple in November 2018. The communist authorities continued to send police to the temple to harass Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô and the abbot Th√≠ch Nguy√™n L√Ω about the residency status of the former, and tried to restrict access by his disciples.  Death  Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô died on 22 February 2020 at age 91 at T·ª´ Hi·∫øu Temple in District 8, Ho Chi Minh City. In his later years, he had been afflicted by diabetes, high blood pressure and a heart condition, the last of which required an operation in 2003. Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô asked for his ashes to be scattered at sea. The exiled Vietnamese dissident blogger ƒêi·∫øu C√†y stated that his death was 'a great loss for the UBCV as well as the movement for freedom and democracy in Vietnam. The Most Venerable Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô dedicated his entire life to struggling for religious freedom for Vietnam'. ƒêi·∫øu C√†y described him as 'one of the main pillars of the UBCV, withstanding many oppressions and persecutions from the communist authorities but nevertheless remaining steadfast in maintaining the independence of the UBCV and not accepting the administration of the communist regime'. Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng Ba, the Vice Chairman of the UBCV in Australia and New Zealand, stated that Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô's contributions extended beyond his work as a scholar and translator, and that his greatest legacy was his 'indomitable spirit', which made him the 'conscience' of the Vietnam people and 'shown the path to our generation'. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom called his death 'an incredible loss for the people of Vietnam' and said that 'With his quiet strength and grace, he fought for decades to preserve and promote religious freedom in Vietnam'. Awards In 2001, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô received the Hellman-Hammet Award from Human Rights Watch for persecuted writers. In 2003, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was honored with the Homo Homini Award for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need, which he shared with Th√≠ch Huy·ªÅn Qu·∫£ng and Father Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√Ω.Martin Hrobsk√Ω (11 April 2003). Homo Homini Awards recognize the work of three Vietnamese activists, Radio Prague International, Czech Radio In 2006, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was awarded the Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize, in recognition of \\"personal courage and perseverance through three decades of peaceful opposition against the communist regime in Vietnam, and as a symbol for the growing democracy movement\\". Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was unable to the receive the award, as the government prevented him from attending the ceremony.The Rafto Foundation, 2006 Laureate Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô In 2006, Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ªô was also awarded the Democracy Courage Tribute by the World Movement for Democracy.

Her television documentaries included The Englishwoman and the Horse, and The Front Garden. Unwrecked England, based on a regular column of the same name she wrote for The OldieThe Oldie Magazine website, accessed 22 August 2014. since 1992, was published in 2009. Lycett Green has been described as \\"the finest writer of our time on the English countryside\\". She edited and introduced her father John Betjeman's letters and prose in three volumes to critical acclaim. She was a commissioner of English Heritage for nine years and her proudest achievement was the role she played in the regeneration of Chatterley Whitfield Colliery, Stoke-On-Trent. She was a member of the Performing Rights Society through her writing of lyrics for songs and was a Contributing Editor to Vogue from 1987. She was part of the original team who started Private Eye. Nicky Haslam nominated Lycett Green as the living person he most admired (\\"beautiful, brave, strong, clever, loving and loved\\").The Guardian; 26 October 2002. Early years Candida Rose Betjeman was born on 22 September 1942 in Dublin where her father, John Betjeman (later Sir John), was wartime press attach√© at the British Embassy.Girvin, Brian (2006) The Emergency: Neutral Ireland 1939‚Äì45 Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh, a friend of her father, celebrated her birth with a poem \\"Candida\\". Her mother, the Hon. Penelope Valentine Hester Betjeman (n√©e Chetwode; 1910‚Äì1986), was the daughter of Field-Marshal Sir Philip Chetwode (later Lord Chetwode) (1869‚Äì1950). Her paternal grandparents, Ernest and Mabel (\\"Bess\\") Betjemann (her father dispensed with the second \\"n\\"), died in 1934 and 1951 respectively. In 2007 Candida attributed to Ernest Betjemann, said by her father to be a hater of verse, a poem found in the log book of a yacht he had sailed on the Norfolk Broads in the 1920s.The Strenuous Life: \\"On the cabin roof lie I / Gazing into vacancy ...\\" (The Times, 6 January 2007) She regretted not asking her father more about his parents: \\"but it's not vital when you're young\\".The Times, 6 January 2007. An elder brother, Paul, had been born in 1937. The Betjemans returned to England in 1943, moving from Uffington to Farnborough, Berkshire in 1945, and then to Wantage in 1951 (Uffington and Wantage were part of Berkshire at the time, but are now part of Oxfordshire). Education Known to her parents as \\"Wibz\\", Candida was educated at St Mary's, Wantage. In her teens she rode ponies competitively; on one occasion, her distinguished father, having spelt out his surname for the purpose of sending a telegram, was asked by a local telephonist if he were \\"any relation of the little girl who wins all the prizes at the horse shows\\".Country Life, 1 February 2007. She took a course in sculpture at a technical college in Oxford. There she met John Wells and Richard Ingrams, then undergraduates at Oxford University, who, shortly afterwards, founded the satirical magazine Private Eye, to which she became a regular contributor.BBC - Been and gone: Lady who collected curious crisps, 4 September 2014. CLG fired from \\"The Lady\\" for moonlighting on Private Eye. Ingrams, who had gone up to Oxford after National Service, was disappointed to find that it was (as he put it) \\"just a lot of men in duffel coats wandering up and down the High Street\\",See Humphrey Carpenter in Oxford Today, Hilary, 2001. while another Eye journalist Paul Foot, not known for hyperbole, described Candida as \\"the most beautiful woman in Oxford\\".Thompson, Harry (1994) Richard Ingrams: Lord of the Gnomes. 1960s On 25 May 1963, Candida Betjeman married Rupert Lycett Green, a rising figure in the tailoring business, whose shop Blades opened first in Dover Street, London and later in Savile Row. His particular kind of entrepreneurship was said at the time to \\"typify the revolt of the upper class young\\". The couple had five children.John Crosby, Weekend Telegraph, 16 April 1965. During the \\"swinging\\" sixties the Lycett Green family was associated with members of London‚Äôs \\"in\\" crowd, Blades being frequented by many stars of the period, including the Beatles, actor Terence Stamp and John Aspinall, founder of the Clermont Club. In 1967, she wrote a poem called the Knightsbridge Ballade that was evocative of the period. In this, the subject (aged 18 as opposed to the poet‚Äôs 25) declared that she was \\"frightfully keen\\" on Terence Stamp and wished she had a bigger bust: \\"Though Mummy says it's frightfully smart/And any more would beckon lust\\".See Lines on the Underground (compiled by Dorothy Meade & Tatiana Meade, 1994), p. 203. Journalism and writing Lycett Green edited two volumes of her father‚Äôs letters (1994‚Äì95) and an anthology of his prose, Coming Home (1997). In the second volume of letters she described herself as a hoarder of correspondence (unlike her brother) and referred to her late father (with her husband) as her best friend. Lycett Green contributed to a number of magazines, including Queen (from which she was dismissed because of her association with Private Eye),Thompson, Richard Ingrams: Lord of the Gnomes Vogue, Country Life and The Oldie. Lycett Green shared some of her father's campaigning zeal, as regards, in particular, the perceived erosion of England's fabric. They both found an outlet in the \\"Nooks and Corners\\" column in Private Eye (to which Betjeman was the first contributor in 1971) and she later contributed to \\"Unwrecked England\\" in The Oldie (also founded by Richard Ingrams). In an article in Country Life in 2003 she identified several aspects of English life which had become \\"universal fixtures in our mind's eye\\": cricket on the village green, Trooping the Colour, bands playing in a town park, the Women's Institute singing Jerusalem, pearly kings and queens at the Lord Mayor's show and discussions about the weather over a pint of beer in the local pub.Country Life, 9 October 2003. In her autobiography, Over the Hills and Far Away, she writes about her experiences with cancer.Profile, skylightrain.com; accessed 1 September 2014. Betjeman centenary (2006) Statue (2007) of Sir John Betjeman at St Pancras Station. In 2006, Lycett Green organised various events to mark the centenary of her father‚Äôs birth. These included a gala at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London and a jamboree in Cornwall for eight thousand people. There were excursions by train from London to Bristol and, through \\"Metro-land\\", to Quainton Road; Lycett Green unveiled a commemorative plaque at Marylebone station to mark Betjeman's fond association with the railways. Presenting the Mayor of Slough, Berkshire, with a book of her father's poems,\\"Berkshire: Poetic justice at last for Slough\\", BBC News; accessed 22 August 2014. she made clear that he had regretted his mildly notorious poem of 1937: > Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough It isn't fit for humans now. Lycett Green wrote about the organisation of these various events, noting the intricacies of the rail schedules (\\"How long will the train stop at Ruislip so that [the poem] Middlesex can be read over the tannoy?\\")Country Life, 8 June 2006 and being followed around Cornwall by a television crew (\\"I have had a microphone down my bra for almost two days now\\").Country Life, 7 September 2006. In 2007 Lycett Green was a member of \\"an alarmingly grown up\\" panel of judges to select a sculptor (Martin Jennings) for a bronze statue of her father that was erected on the concourse of the redeveloped St. Pancras station in London.Country Life, 26 April 2007.

Zelinsky (born 1953) is an American illustrator and writer best known for illustrating children's picture books. He won the 1998 Caldecott Medal for U.S. picture book illustration, recognizing Rapunzel. His most popular work is The Wheels on the Bus, a best-selling movable book. Zelinsky had been one Caldecott runner-up in 1985, 1987, and 1995, the latter for Swamp Angel by Anne Isaacs (Dutton, 1994). Twenty years later, they were joint runners-up for the Phoenix Picture Book Award from the Children's Literature Association, which annually recognizes the best picture book that did not win a major award 20 years earlier. \\"Books are considered not only for the quality of their illustrations, but for the way pictures and text work together.\\"\\"Phoenix Picture Book Award\\" . Children's Literature Association. Retrieved 2014-07-11. Biography Early life Paul O. Zelinsky was born in Evanston, Illinois, and he grew up in Wilmette. As a child he spent much of his time drawing. Often with his friends, he would make up imaginary worlds, and draw them. When he was only four, he submitted work to Highlights magazine, and his artwork was first showcased. Some of his influential childhood book favorites included The Color Kittens, and The Tawny Scrawny Lion. Zelinsky said in reference to memories of what he had read, \\"Feelings come to me as a sort of flavor. I know that when I call up my earliest memories, what I remember seeing and hearing is accompanied by a flavor-like sense of what it felt like to be there and see that.\\" In later years of his youth, his favorite authors were William P√®ne du Bois, and Robert Lawson. He especially loved the books The Twenty-One Balloons, by du Bois, and The Fantastic Flight. Career At New Trier High School, Zelinsky was interested in natural history as well as architecture and saw himself following one of those paths for a career. However, he went to study at Yale. He took a class taught by Maurice Sendak on the history and art of children's books, and it inspired him to a career in the area. Zelinsky went to graduate school at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia and Rome. The Renaissance and Italian art always fascinated him, and this time in his life influenced this love as well. His career in children's books began in 1978 with the illustrations for Avi's Emily Upham's Revenge. Since then, he has continued to illustrate others' work, as well as creating his own books. He won the 1998 Caldecott Medal for his illustrated retelling of Rapunzel, and three Caldecott Honors (for Hansel and Gretel (1985), Rumpelstiltskin (1987), and Swamp Angel (1995)). His most popular book is The Wheels on the Bus, which has sold millions. Artistic style Zelinsky does not have a recognizable style, suiting his artwork and techniques to the particular nature of the book to be illustrated. According to Linnea Lannon in a Detroit Free Press profile of the artist, \\"what has raised Zelinsky into the first rank of children's book illustrators is not just the pictures but the way they integrate with text.\\" Zelinsky says, \\"I want the pictures to speak in the same voice as the words. This desire has led me to try various kinds of drawings in different books. I have used quite a wide stretch of styles, and I'm fortunate to have been asked to illustrate such a range of stories.\\"\\"Paul O.

Following several shipping disasters near Evanston, residents successfully lobbied the federal government for a lighthouse. Construction was completed in 1873. The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 1976. On 20 January 1999, the lighthouse was designated a National Historic Landmark. It is maintained under the jurisdiction of the Evanston Lighthouse Park District, an independent taxing authority. \\\\- History Impetus The United States government agreed to construct the lighthouse at Grosse Point after several maritime disasters near the area showed need for it. Shoals were a real hazard, and ship traffic was increasing concurrent with development in the Midwest, the growth of Chicago, the aftermath of the Chicago Fire, and the increased trade and exploitation of natural resources throughout the Great Lakes. Particularly influential was the 1860 sinking of the Lady Elgin, a disaster which claimed more than 300 lives.Claims vary as to the exact number killed in the sinking of the Lady Elgin. Estimates of 300 are available in the January 1990 issue of Illinois Issues via Northern Illinois University Libraries. The estimate was reasserted by Northwestern University's Medill News Service on April 15, 1999. An excerpt from the 1860 diary of Fannie Seward indicates that the reports of the day stated 300 dead. However, other sources such as information hosted on Stanford University's servers estimates 470 dead. The citizens of Evanston petitioned the government for the light station, but the Civil War (1861-1865) delayed any funding for the project. Lighthouses in Chicago proper were proving themselves insufficient, so there was a perceived need for action. Construction The project to construct a lighthouse began in 1872, supervised by Orlando Metcalf Poe, who designed the buildings. Most of the construction was completed by June 30, 1873, although the lamp would not be lit for several months. Finally, in March 1874, the light commenced operation. The building is designed in Italianate architecture. In summer 1865 Colonel Poe became the Lighthouse Board's chief engineer; in 1870 he was promoted to the position of Chief Engineer of the Upper Great Lakes 11th Lighthouse District. In this capacity he designed eight \\"Poe style lighthouses\\" and oversaw construction of several. Poe was named District Engineer for the Eleventh Lighthouse District, Those lights are New Presque Isle Light (1870) on Lake Huron, Lake Michigan's South Manitou Island Light (1872), Grosse Point Light (1873) in Evanston, Illinois, Lake Superior's Au Sable Light (1874), Outer Island Light (1874) in the Apostle Islands, Little Sable Point Light (1874) on Lake Michigan, Cheboygan County, Michigan's Spectacle Reef Light {1874} on Lake Huron, Racine, Wisconsin's Wind Point Light (1880); and Manistique, Michigan's Seul Choix Light (1895). Deactivation and conversion to private aid to navigation In 1935, the federal government turned over the grounds and the buildings, except for the lighthouse tower and light, to the city of Evanston. In 1941, the Grosse Point Light Station was decommissioned by the United States Coast Guard as a precaution against possible air raids in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor. After the decommissioning, the city received the tower and the light. But the lease allows the government to take the light station back if they ever needed it for official use. The light was reignited in 1945 and has served as a secondary navigational aid ever since. The lighthouse is operated by the Lighthouse Park District of Evanston, Illinois, once known as the Northeast Park District, but since renamed in honor of the lighthouse. Illinois has two well-known and historic light stations in the Chicago area, plus two pierhead lights. Chicago has no area lighthouse preservation group, and this light has been the primary beneficiary of preservation efforts in the area. The Calumet Harbor Light‚Äîjust across the border in Indiana, and one of eleven past or present lighthouses in Indiana, was demolished in 1995. Architecture and design Light tower The Gross Point Light's primary structure is the conical light tower. The tower stands on a concrete foundation with wooden piles that reach to a depth of . The tower's two outer walls include an inner air space between them. The inner wall has a thickness of and rises vertically. The outer wall, at a thickness of , rises at a slight incline and gives the tower its conical shape. The tower begins with a circumference at its base and at its parapet. The tower lantern is of glass and iron construction and is topped by a copper sheeting roof. Lantern and optics The second order Fresnel lens is the largest lens (one of five) placed on the Great Lakes, which underscores the importance of this light. The lens was manufactured by Henry-Lepaute Company of Paris. It is still in place, which makes it unique; it has been said that this is the single remaining 2nd Order Fresnel lens that is still in place and in service on the Great Lakes. This is one of only 70 such Fresnel lenses that are still operational in the United States, sixteen of which are in use on the Great Lakes of which eight are in Michigan. Grosse Point legends The site of the Grosse Point Lighthouse is the purported site where Father Jacques Marquette landed in 1674 during his trip down the west side of Lake Michigan to visit various Illinois Native American tribes. This tale is largely anecdotal as there is no real historical proof that this ever occurred. Current activities The keeper's house with the light behind it in 2020 The light is north of Chicago, just north of Northwestern University. Notwithstanding that it is outside the corporate limits of Chicago, it is said: \\"The keeper's house is Chicago's only maritime museum; one fog signal building serves as a visitor center while the other houses a nature center\\" The dwelling and tower are opened during summer weekends for tours.

La Farge is an American novelist, essayist and academic. As of 2017, he has published five novels: The Artist of the Missing (1999), Haussmann, or the Distinction (2001), The Facts of Winter (2005), Luminous Airplanes (2011) and The Night Ocean (2017), all of which, particularly Haussmann, have earned positive critical attention. His essays and reviews have been published in outlets such as The Village Voice, Harper's, and The New Yorker. Biography A native of New York City, La Farge graduated from Yale University and has taught writing at Wesleyan University on and off since 2002. From 2009 to 2010, he was a Visiting Professor of English at Wesleyan. He has taught writing at Columbia. He was the 2005 winner of the fourth annual Bard Fiction Prize bestowed by Bard College, where he is on the MFA faculty. He is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2002) and a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship (2012) and has been chosen as artist-in-residence at artists' colonies MacDowell and Yaddo. From 2016 to 2017, La Farge was the Picador Guest Professor for Literature at the University of Leipzig's Institute for American Studies in Leipzig, Germany. Novels La Farge's first novel, The Artist of the Missing, was published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in May 1999, and illustrated with surrealist images by cubist artist Stephen Alcorn.The Artist of the Missing illustrations Alcorn Gallery. The novel takes place in an anonymous, modern-day city in which people go missing on a regular basis. Frank, the titular character, paints portraits of the missing, among whom are his parents, his brother James and, eventually, even his romantic interest, enigmatic police photographer Prudence, whose job it was to take pictures of corpses. Reviewers compared the debut work to those of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Jorge Luis Borges and categorized him among \\"literary wizards\\" and \\"fantasists\\". Two years later, his second novel, Haussmann, or the Distinction (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, September 2001) purports to peel layers from the mysterious private life of Baron Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann (1809-1891), the flawed genius city planner who, in the 1860s, masterminded the carving up of Parisian streets into modern boulevards, of which the Champs-√âlys√©es is the most renowned example. In his review for The New York Times, Edmund White called it \\"imaginative -- indeed, a hallucinatory -- approach, one that ends up by transforming his supremely practical subject (for Haussmann was above all a systematic worker) into an elegant and sometimes grotesque fairy-tale hero\\".Edmund White \\"Who Put the Gay in Paree?\\", New York Times, 21 October 2001. The novel's insistently presented premise (that the author, Paul La Farge, is merely the translator of an obscure French-language text by a forgotten minimalist metaphysician named Paul Poissel) extended to the \\"reproduction\\", in the opening pages of the book, of the title page of the \\"posthumously\\" published in 1922, \\"first (and only) French edition of Haussmann, or the Distinction\\", and the inclusion, in the afterword, of daguerreotypes, the first of which depicts a female whom the caption identifies as \\"Yvonne Dutronc, ca. 1872\\", a character which does not even appear in the main narrative, but is mentioned only in the afterword, in La Farge's own (fictional) footnote and (apparently) on the dedication page--\\"for Y.\\" The second image purports to be that of \\"Paul Poissel in 1880\\" and both are described as having been \\"found\\" by the afterword's veritable author, Paul La Farge, himself, in the archives of the French national library, Biblioth√®que nationale. An elaborate website, The long sad life of Paul Poissel, which expands the conceit, assigns June 4, 1848-November 17, 1921 as Poissel's dates, along with myriad details about his life and times. The entire website functions as satire, including, at one point, the accusation that the American author \\"masquerading\\" under the French name \\"La Farge\\" had the audacity to put his own name on front cover, as if he was the actual author. Other parts of the website include quotations, such as an excerpt from a 1934 letter Walter Benjamin \\"wrote\\" to Gershom Scholem, in which he makes a deeply complicated observation about Poissel, and also MP3 files featuring early archival \\"recordings\\" of Poissel's voice, reciting (in French) portions from his own \\"works\\". Haussmann, as a whole, also serves to display the depth of La Farge's scholarship into the period of the Second Empire as well as his playfulness with language (the putative front page of the 1922 work indicates that it was issued \\"√† Paris, chez les √âditions de cire perdu\\", or by \\"the Paris Publishing House of Lost-Wax Casting\\"). The \\"Poissel\\" name extends to and, to a degree, arrogates La Farge's third book, The Facts of Winter (McSweeney's, June 2005) which, on its front cover, states, \\"by Paul Poissel, translated by Paul La Farge\\". It is also set in Paris, although the year is now 1881, a decade into the Third Republic. The reader is privy to \\"a series of short dreams, each dreamed by people in and around Paris, which is to say that it is a fictional account of the imaginary lives of people who may or may not be real\\". Again, La Farge's command of French is featured, as the dream accounts come to the reader in both French and English, and the descriptive language is hauntingly poetic. The scholarly \\"afterword\\" strives to elucidate further the work and thought of the \\"unjustly neglected\\" author of this tome, Paul Poissel. His book Luminous Airplanes is the humorous story of a young man with two mothers who learns a family secret while cleaning out his grandfather's house in upstate New York. The book was published in 2011 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux and features immersive text. A description of the book appears here. It was listed as one of \\"the Most Criminally Overlooked Books of 2011\\" by Emily Temple in Flavorwire. In March 2017, La Farge publishedThe Night Ocean, a novel about a doctor investigating the relationship between horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and a teenage boy. The novel, published by Penguin Press, was listed as one of \\"28 books to read in 2017\\" by Jeva Lange in The Week.

Having a height of 50 metres, it was the highest building in the city for more than a century. Its initial purpose was to be used as a bell tower -- its 1,700 kg bell, was moved to the Sinaia Monastery after the tower was demolished. It was also meant to serve as a watch tower.Curentul, \\"Turnul Col≈£ei a rƒÉmas √Æn amintirea bucure≈ütenilor\\", 23 August 2006  The tower was named after Vornic Col≈£ea Doicescu. His brother, Udrea Doicesu, built a small wooden church on the plot near the tower; after he was assassinated, the church and the land next to it were inherited by Col≈£ea, who donated them to the Orthodox Church. The Church sold the patch of land near the church to SpƒÉtar Mihai Cantacuzino, who, in 1701, used it as the location for the first hospital in Wallachia, the Col≈£ei Hospital, and also decided to build a tower.Ionescu, p. 13 The tower was built between 1709 and 1714, its construction being assisted by the Swedish soldiers of the army of King Charles XII, who had fled to Wallachia after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Poltava.

It is situated on the north side of the A80 road and between the M73 and M80 motorways which converge nearby. Moodiesburn does not directly adjoin any other settlements, though the villages of Chryston and Muirhead are located a short distance to the west (the boundary being the Bothlin Burn), with Stepps beyond, and outer parts of Cumbernauld lie to the east; however, the town centres are about apart. Once a thriving community, the town's economic standing greatly declined in the latter half of the 20th century, following the Auchengeich mining disaster and the disintegration of local employment. History The etymology of the name is probably from the common Scottish surname Moody. Several old documents show Moodiesburn with various spellings including maps by Richardson, Forrest, and William Roy. Moodiesburn (or Mudiesburn) was formerly part of the parish of Cadder. The New Statistical Accounts recorded 30 families and 143 people in 1836. In 1846 there were reported to be 35 houses with 220 people living in them. Towards the end of the 19th century the population fell to as low as 150. The town was developed in the 20th century with employment in coal mining and around psychiatric institution Stoneyetts Hospital. In the 1930s, wooden houses were constructed on the estate of Gartferry House. Auchengeich mining disaster In September 1959, 47 men lost their lives in a coal mine near the village of Moodiesburn when a faulty fan purifying the air in the colliery went on fire due to an electrical fault. The men were in bogies travelling to the coal face to start work, and due to the intense smoke they were abandoned just a few hundred yards from safety. The mine was eventually flooded to put out the fire; there was only one survivor from the crews. The mining accident was one of the worst within the UK in the 20th century, widowing 41 women and leaving 76 children without a father. The First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond unveiled a memorial on 18 September 2009 at Moodiesburn. Its centrepiece, a bronze statue of a miner, was stolen within weeks but replaced the following year after a fundraising drive. Norman Buchan wrote a song, \\"Auchengeich\\", about the disaster, recorded by Dick Gaughan and The Easy Club. Aftermath and economic decline Local mining declined in the years following the disaster. Stoneyetts ceased operation in 1992, followed by Scottish Power and Reekie Plant Hire sites closing in the latter half of the decade. A 1999 article in The Observer lamented Moodiesburn's lack of local employment, as well as the increasing disaffection of its younger residents: Auchengeich sewage works and the Moodiesburn House Hotel ‚Äì previously the Bedlay Dowager House ‚Äì were closed in 2003 and 2008, respectively.

There is also the Silver Larch public house, a Knights of Saint Columba social club and a coffee shop called The Coffee House. Although the oldest buildings and the original hamlet stood at the junction of Cumbernauld Road (A80) and Stoneyetts Road, its centre moved about north during the mid-20th century with the construction of a small development of timber- panelled homes (Hillhead Avenue etc) and then expanded from there across the subsequent decades. The community's 1950s council housing (Bridgeburn Drive, Langdale Road, Glenmanor Avenue etc) is known as \\"Old Moodiesburn\\" ‚Äì though a substantial number of those homes are now privately owned. A batch of houses with updated facilities were constructed in the 1960s, and dubbed the \\"electric scheme\\" by locals. Modern homes have since been developed in this part of Moodiesburn, including by Taylor Woodrow (1989), Persimmon (1997) and Lovell (2016). The opposite, north-eastern end by Devro headquarters, is composed mostly of private residences by Christian Salvesen (1970), Tay/Wimpey (1992), Bellway (1995) and Persimmon (2006 and 2018). Miller Homes are set to build on the former Stoneyetts Hospital site as of 2019. A small estate of new council builds was erected in the midst of the Salvesen area in 2013.

Princess Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso conceived the piece in 1837 and persuaded Franz Liszt to assemble a set of variations of the march along with five of his pianist-friends. Liszt composed the introduction, second variation, connecting sections and finale, and integrated the piece into an artistic unity.

Biography  Little is known about the life of Jean Br√©hal with the exception of some documents regarding his career within the Dominican Order. It is known that he made his profession of faith among the Dominicans of the city of √âvreux and remained faithful to the city's best interests for the rest of his life. He studied philosophy and theology for seven years at the University of Caen, supported financially by the √©bro√Øciens, until 1443, when he was made Doctor of Theology. In 1452, while residing in Paris, he became the Inquisitor-general of France; and two years later, in 1455, was elected prior of the convent of Saint-Jacques of Paris and finally elected to review the trial of Joan of Arc's conviction. In 1474, he returned to his convent Saint-Louis d'√âvreux, and became vicar of the master of the order. During the remainder of his life as vicar he tried to reform the lives of the Dominicans by encouraging a return to poverty and the community of goods. He passed away sometime around 1479.

During the course of that year and up until 1453, Br√©hal traveled all around the country and he questioned several witnesses in Rouen, where Joan was imprisoned and executed, sought information all over the kingdom about her life, and consulted several lawyers and theologians in both France and Europe, as well as Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux. In 1455, Callixtus III, the Pope at that time, was pressured by d'Estouteville, representing Joan's mother, Isabelle Rom√©e, and two of her brothers, to clear her name. In response to the petition, Callixtus gave his full support to Br√©hal and appointed three agents that would assist him during the procedures: Jean Juv√©nal des Ursins, archbishop of Reims, Guillaume Chartier, bishop of Paris and Richard Olivier de Longueil, bishop of Coutances. During his research, Br√©hal wrote two books about the matter; in the first, the Summarium, he sets out the facts around the trial of 1431; while in the second, he refutes point by point the accusations against Joan on the basis of theology and canon law. In November 7th of 1455, he presided the retrial at Notre-Dame,Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses\\", pp. 264‚Äì265. where he questioned, along with several theologians and clergymen of all Europe, a total of 115 witnesses that knew Joan; from childhood friends, soldiers whom served under her command, citizens of Orleans and, with not so much enthusiasm, former members of the tribunal that condemned her in 1431.Pernoud, Regine and Clin, Marie-Veronique. \\"Joan of Arc : Her Story\\", p. 157. With all the information he heard, Br√©hal declared in June of 1456 that Joan had died a martyr and posthumously excommunicated Pierre Cauchon, the main instigator of the trial, branding him as an heretic who was pursuing a secular vendetta. One year later, Pope Callixtus III confirmed the excommunication. Br√©hal was present during the final declaration of Joan's innocence on July 7, in Rouen, when all articles of Joan's trial where burnt publicly. In Orleans, he presided over the commemorative feasts and it was likely that he met Joan's elderly mother during a celebratory banquet that the citizens offered to Inquisitor Br√©hal on July 27.Pernoud, Regine. \\"Joan of Arc By Herself and Her Witnesses\\", p. 269.

In January 2010, the SportCruiser was added to the Piper Aircraft line as the PiperSport under a licensing agreement with Czech Sport Aircraft. This arrangement was terminated one year later in January 2011. Design and development The aircraft is of all aluminum construction with a low wing configuration. It can be fitted with either a Rotax 912ULS or a Jabiru 3300 engine. Approved propellers include the Woodcomp Klassic 170/3/R. The SportCruiser has an optional Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute, auto pilot and Dynon or TruTrak EFIS. The aircraft is capable of cruising at with a range of . No wind, standard day gross weight takeoff is achieved in and landing in . The SportCruiser is designed to fit into the ultralight or microlight category in several countries as well as the United States' Light-sport Aircraft category. Between 2006 and 2010 it was available either as a kit, or as a fully built production model. The SportCruiser is accepted as a US FAA LSA, FAA homebuilt kit and the UK under BCAR Section \\"S\\". PiperSport On 21 January 2010 Piper Aircraft announced that they had licensed a derivative of the SportCruiser and would market it as the PiperSport. Piper CEO Kevin Gould said: \\"The PiperSport is an amazing entry-level aircraft that will bring new customers into Piper and lead the way for those customers to step up into more sophisticated and higher performance aircraft within our line over time.\\" The PiperSport is a minimally modified version of the existing SportCruiser. The plan was that it would continue to be manufactured by Czech Sport Aircraft, with Piper's manufacturing operation playing no part in the construction, although Piper was distributing parts. The changes to the aircraft are stronger nosegear, a Ballistic Recovery Systems parachute and leather interior both as standard equipment, a cockpit sunshade and modified pitch controls, plus a custom paint scheme. Previously the Sport Cruiser was available as a completed aircraft or a kit, but Piper offered it only as a completed aircraft, sold as a Special Light-sport aircraft in the USA. It was distributed by the Piper dealer network worldwide. Deliveries under the Piper name commenced with the initial customer receiving their aircraft on 13 April 2010 at Sun 'n Fun. The aircraft was offered in three different trim and avionics configurations, with higher end models offering the Dynon Avionics D100 glass cockpit and autopilot. All models were delivered with the Rotax 912S powerplant of . PiperSport LSA aircraft exhibited at the 2011 Sun 'n Fun show at Lakeland Linder International Airport Florida Piper indicated that they had carried out extensive test flying on the SportCruiser before agreeing to add it to their line and that the aircraft's slow sales in the past had been related to marketing issues and not any deficiencies with the aircraft design. Piper planned to market the aircraft to flight schools as well as private owners. In analyzing the Piper decision to distribute the SportCruiser, instead of design its own LSA, AvWeb analyst Paul Bertorelli said: On 12 January 2011, after selling a total of 45 aircraft, Piper announced that the PiperSport would be discontinued. Piper CEO Geoffrey Berger stated: PS-28 Cruiser at Cotswold Airport, Gloucestershire, England, 2016 After the Piper announcement the PiperSport importer and dealer network indicated that the aircraft would be continued to be imported under a new name. Importer U.S. Sport Aircraft CEO Don Ayres stated that said his company was engaged in \\"business as usual...aircraft will continue to be sold and supported\\". The aviation press reacted with skepticism as to Piper's explanation for terminating its arrangements with CSA. AvWeb editor Paul Bertorelli said, \\"In my view, we are not getting the full story on its decision to exit the LSA segment. In a tersely worded statement a week before the show, Piper said it was terminating its relationship with the Czech supplier of its PiperSport LSA, citing 'differences in business philosophies.' That phrase is code speak for a significant behind-the-scenes blowup. In my opinion, either Piper concluded the margins on LSAs weren't worth the trouble and it would rather focus on jets or its Czech supplier was doing something it didn't like. Or both.\\" Czech Sport Aircraft reacted to the ending of the Piper deal by indicating that business would continue through the same distributor and dealer network and that the name of the aircraft would be changed back to SportCruiser. The company did indicate that the disagreement with Piper involved the geographical focus that Piper had put on marketing in the US to the detriment of the rest of the world. The company indicated that it will continue to develop the aircraft and planned revisions to the spinner, canopy, elevator, ailerons and wingtips in the immediate future.

The battle, which took the form of a series of skirmish actions, was the last major engagement of 1777 between British and American forces. George Washington, commander-in-chief of the American revolutionary forces, spent the weeks after his defeat at the Battle of Germantown encamped with the Continental Army in various locations throughout Montgomery County, just north of British-occupied Philadelphia. In early November, the Americans established an entrenched position approximately north of Philadelphia along the Wissahickon Creek and Sandy Run, primarily situated on several hills between Old York Road and Bethlehem Pike. From here, Washington monitored British troop movements in Philadelphia and evaluated his options. On December 4, Gen. Sir William Howe, the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, led a sizable contingent of troops out of Philadelphia in one last attempt to destroy Washington and the Continental Army before the onset of winter. After a series of skirmishes, Howe called off the attack and returned to Philadelphia without engaging Washington in a decisive conflict. With the British back in Philadelphia, Washington was able to march his troops to winter quarters at Valley Forge.  Background and movement to battle  After their October 4, 1777, defeat at the Battle of Germantown, Washington's army retreated along Skippack Pike to Pawling's Mill, beyond the Perkiomen Creek, where they remained encamped until October 8. They then marched east on Skippack Pike, turned left on Forty-Foot Road (present-day Old Forty-Foot Road), and marched to Sumneytown Pike, where they camped on the property of Frederick Wampole near Kulpsville in Towamencin Township.Martin, p. 151. While there, Brig. Gen. Francis Nash died of wounds incurred at Germantown and was buried in the Mennonite Meeting Cemetery. Washington remained at Towamencin for one week, gathering supplies and waiting to see if Howe would move against him.Martin, p. 152. On October 16, Washington moved his forces to Methacton Hill in Worcester Township. After learning of Howe's withdrawal from Germantown to Philadelphia, Washington moved his army to Whitpain, closer to Philadelphia, on October 20.Martin, p. 153. On October 29, Washington's army numbered 8,313 Continentals and 2,717 militia, although the terms of enlistment of many soldiers from Maryland and Virginia were due to expire.Ward, p. 378. With his ranks reinforced, Washington dispatched a brigade to assist with the defense of Forts Mifflin and Mercer, on the Delaware River. Emlen House, Washington's headquarters at White Marsh, in 2007 On November 2, at the recommendation of his council of war, Washington marched his forces to White Marsh, approximately northwest of Philadelphia.Martin, p. 154. Washington established headquarters at the Emlen House, where he and his aides were quartered. Original source: At White Marsh, the army began to build redoubts and defensive works, including abatis in front of their encampment.McMichael, p. 214. Colonel Daniel Morgan After the surrender of British Lt. Gen. John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga, Washington began drawing troops from the north, including the 1,200 men of Varnum's Rhode Island brigade, and about 1,000 more men from various Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia units.Ward, p. 377. Maj. Gen. Horatio Gates sent Col. Daniel Morgan's rifle corps, and the brigades of Paterson and Glover. With these additional forces, and the pending onset of winter, Washington had to face the problem of supplying his army. A quarter of the troops were barefooted, and there were very few blankets or warm clothing. Washington became so desperate that he even offered a reward of $10 to the person who could supply the \\"best substitute for shoes, made of raw hides\\". Morale was so low and desertion so common that Washington offered a pardon on October 24 to all deserters who returned by January 1. Washington's loss of Philadelphia and inactivity brought criticism from Congress, who pressured him to attack the city. He therefore called a council of war on November 24 which voted against an attack 11 to 4.Martin, p. 156. Nonetheless, Washington rode out the next day to view the British defenses, which turned to be stronger than he had expected.Martin, p.157. Capt. John Montresor was responsible for establishing the defenses around British-occupied Philadelphia. On October 19, Howe withdrew the British forces from Germantown and focused on the defense of Philadelphia. British military engineer Capt. John Montresor supervised the building of a series of fourteen formidable redoubts that began at Upper Ferry, along the Schuylkill River, and extended eastward to the shores of the Delaware River, just north of Philadelphia.McGuire, p. 238.Ward, p. 379. Howe took advantage of his time in Philadelphia to raise additional forces from the loyalist population in the region. Newly-promoted Maj. John Graves Simcoe reinforced his unit, the Queen's Rangers, which had lost over a quarter of its men at the Battle of Brandywine.McGuire, p. 231. William Allen, Jr., the son of notable loyalist William Allen, raised the 1st Battalion of Pennsylvania Loyalists, and was made its lieutenant colonel.McGuire, pp. 231‚Äì232. Loyalist James Chalmers raised the 1st Battalion of Maryland Loyalists, and was given its command.McGuire, p. 232. Recruitment also took place among the city's Irish Catholic population, with the formation of the Irish Catholic Volunteers, and in the counties immediately surrounding Philadelphia.McGuire, p. 232. Most notably, Loyalist dragoons were raised by Richard Hovenden in Philadelphia County and Jacob James in Chester County, and a Bucks County regiment raised by Thomas Sandford. In mid-November, the fall of Forts Mifflin and Mercer effectively ended American control of the Delaware River, and much-needed supplies began arriving at the city's docks, along with 2,000 additional British soldiers.McGuire, p. 236. The weeks with two major armies sitting within miles of each other were not without conflict, and a petite guerreTerm petite guerre specifically used by McGuire, p. 233. ensued in the no man's land between White Marsh and Northern Liberties. Minor skirmishes between light troops increased in intensity throughout November, with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans.McGuire, p. 233. In retaliation, on November 22, Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area, including Fair Hill, a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson.McGuire, p. 234. Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground, and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle. Just one day earlier, crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware.McGuire, p. 235. On the same morning the mansions were burned, an earthquake struck Philadelphia, and was felt as far away as Lancaster.McGuire, p. 237. McGuire notes the event was recorded in the journals of Captain von Munchhausen, John Laurens and Christopher Marshall. On November 27, an aurora borealis lit up the night skies.McGuire, p. 237. McGuire notes the event was recorded in the journals of James Allen in Allentown and Joseph Plumb Martin. The two events caused quite a stir among both the residents of Philadelphia and the troops, British and American alike, who took them as an ominous sign of things to come.McGuire, p. 237. By early December, Howe decided, despite having written to Colonial Secretary Lord George Germain requesting to be relieved of his command, that he was in a position to make one last attempt to destroy Washington's army before the onset of winter, and he began preparations for an attack on the American forces.McGuire, p. 239. Washington's intelligence network in Philadelphia, led by Maj. John Clark, became aware of British plans to surprise the Americans. According to a historically unsubstantiated story, \\"Family legend contributes the colorful but uncorroborated story of Lydia Darragh and her listening post for eavesdropping on the British.\\" Howe's movements were revealed to the Americans by a Quaker woman named Lydia Darragh,Darrah's exploits were first documented in the article Lydia Darragh: One of the Heroines of the Revolution by Henry Darrach, published in 1915 by the City History Society of Philadelphia. A copy of this article is online here . who overheard British officers quartered in her house discussing Howe's plan, and crossed the British lines to deliver this information to Col. Elias Boudinot of the Continental Army, who was at the Rising Sun Tavern between Germantown and Northern Liberties, (located at the present day intersection of Germantown Avenue and Old York Road City History Society of Philadelphia, p. 396.) attempting to secure provisions.McGuire, p. 240. Boudinot immediately relayed this information to Washington, and the Continental Army was ready when Howe, with a force of approximately 10,000 men, marched out of Philadelphia just prior to midnight on December 4.Martin, p. 160. The advance column, led by Lt. Gen. Lord Cornwallis, headed up Germantown Pike. A second column, led by Lt. Gen. von Knyphausen, marched toward the American left. First day of battle A German map of the Battle of White Marsh. Just after midnight on December 5, Cornwallis' vanguard, which consisted of two British light infantry battalions, skirmished with an American cavalry patrol under the command of Capt. Allen McLane near Three Mile Run on Skippack Road. McLane sent a messenger to Washington, alerting him of the British movements. While the main body of the British troops marched through Germantown, Beggarstown, and Flourtown, American alarm cannons were sounded and positions manned.McMichael, p. 215. At 3:00 am,Ward, p. 380. the British halted on Chestnut Hill, just south of the American defenses, and waited for daybreak. During the night, Washington ordered his troops to build additional campfires to deceive the British. \\"...[I]t looked as if fifty thousand men were encamped there. By day we could see this was merely a trick...,\\" wrote Hessian Maj. Carl von Bauermeister. Expecting a confrontation, Washington took the precaution of striking his tents before sunrise, and sent the heavy baggage north to Trappe. He then dispatched troops to find out the size and intent of the British column.Martin, p. 161. Brig. Gen. James Irvine of the Pennsylvania militia took 600 men and marched them through the Wissahickon Valley toward Chestnut Hill.McGuire, p. 241. Brig. Gen. James Potter's brigade of about 1,000 Pennsylvania militia and Webb's 2nd Connecticut Regiment of 200 men moved to screen Irvine's right. Around noon, Irvine's detachment encountered the British light infantry on the north side of Chestnut Hill. The Pennsylvania militia got off the first volley, but were soon routed by the British. While attempting to rally his fleeing troops, Irvine had three fingers shot off, and was taken prisoner when he fell from his horse.McGuire, p. 242. Potter's brigade immediately fled, despite orders to advance and skirmish with the British light infantry. The 2nd Connecticut made a brief stand, killing three and wounding eleven, including British Capt. Sir James Murray-Pulteney. British Lt. Col. Robert Abercromby decided to push his advantage after scattering Irvine's troops. He pushed north and captured St. Thomas Episcopal Church, located on a hillock. Howe arrived a short while later, and ascended to the top of the church's bell tower in an attempt to view the American positions. Deciding the American defenses were too strong to attack with his present force, he opted to shell their defenses with artillery fire; however, his guns did not have the range to hit Washington's defenses. His forces camped on Chestnut Hill that night, and planned a new way of attack for the following day. Second and third days of battle The Wissahickon Creek, near the encampment of the Pennsylvania militia. The two armies spent December 6 watching each other across the Wissahickon Valley. Howe hoped that Washington would leave his positions to attack the British; Washington did not, preferring instead to let the British do the maneuvering.McGuire, p. 243. By day's end, Howe decided upon a flanking movement toward the Americans' left, toward Jenkintown and Cheltenham Township, while Maj. Gen. Charles Grey's forces would create a distraction by attacking the American center.Martin, p. 162. Sometime after 1:00 amSources differ as to whether it was 1:00 am or 2:00 am on December 7, Howe marched the British Army back through Germantown, and then to Jenkintown, where they remained until noon. As the British movements were concealed by a ridge on Chestnut Hill, Washington did not become aware of Howe's maneuvering until 8:00 am. He immediately moved Morgan's Rifle Corps. and Col. Mordecai Gist's Maryland militia eastward to cover his left flank. About a mile to the right of this detachment, Brig. Gen. James Potter's brigade of Pennsylvania militia, and Webb's 2nd Connecticut Regiment, under Lieut. Col. Isaac Sherman, proceeded down Limekiln Road toward Edge Hill. Movement of the British rear guard, including the J√§gers and the Queen's Rangers, was hindered by the burning of the villages of Cresheim and Beggarstown by troops at the front of the column.McGuire, p. 244. Howe's right was now situated near the Abington Presbyterian Meeting. His main force moved to situate itself on Edge Hill, a ridge that ran parallel to, and a mile in front of, the American lines.McGuire, p. 245. Grey's column had broken off from the main column, and proceeded up Whitemarsh Church Road toward the American center. Maj. Gen. Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey Gen. Grey had been instructed not to attack until he heard the sound of firing from Howe's column, but after several hours, he became impatient and decided to proceed on his own.Martin, p.163. He formed his column into three divisions, with the Queen's Rangers on the left, the J√§gers on each side of the road, and the light infantry of the Guards on the right,McGuire, p. 246. and headed in the direction of Tyson's Tavern on Limekiln Road. As Grey advanced toward the American center, his troops took fire from American militia on Edge Hill.Sources are inconsistent as to which American troops fired on Grey. The militia were quickly routed, with between twenty and thirty killed, and fifteen of them taken as prisoners. Gens. John Cadwalader and Joseph Reed, out reconnoitering on horse near Twickenham, the country estate of Thomas Wharton Jr., attempted to rally Potter's fleeing Pennsylvania militia. Lieut. Col. Sherman, the officer in charge of the 2nd Connecticut Continentals, resented Reed's assumption of command, and later complained to Washington that it put \\"...Officers and Men into such confusion that it rendered it impossible to keep that regularity so necessary when going into Action.\\"McGuire, p. 248. The British soon had them surrounded and outnumbered, and the Pennsylvania militia again panicked and fled. The 2nd Connecticut Continentals made a stand, firing between two and five rounds per man; Sherman only gave the order to retreat when the J√§gers were within 15‚Äì20 yards of his position. At some point, Cadwalader and Reed became separated from the militia, and Reed's horse was shot out from under him. A body of Hessians charged at the two officers with bayonets,Event was the subject of a painting entitled \\"General Reed at Whitemarsh\\" (c. 1785‚Äì1787) by Charles Willson Peale. See article by Charles Coleman Sellers titled \\"Charles Willson Peale with Patron and Populace. A Supplement to \\"Portraits and Miniatures by Charles Willson Peale. With a Survey of His Work in Other Genres\\" in Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Ser., Vol. 59, No. 3 (1969):22, for more information. but Capt. McLane rode up with a few dragoons and ordered a charge that scattered the Hessians. McLane then took the two officers to safety.McGuire, p. 249. Sherman actually accused Reed of leaving \\"the Regiment and Field with precipitation\\" after the \\"Enemy began to fire.\\" William Augustus West, Lord Cantelupe, The Pennsylvania militia fled in panic down Edge Hill, across Sandy Run, and toward the main American camp. Right behind them were men of the 2nd Connecticut, also in disorderly retreat. They were pursued to within yards of their encampment by the Queen's Rangers and J√§gers, who then fell back and took a position on Edge Hill,McGuire, p. 250. between Grey's troops and Howe's main column. Morgan's Rifle Corps and Gist's Maryland militia had taken position on Edge Hill, about a mile to the east of Grey's troops, and higher up on the ridge. A small group of Americans moved down to attack Col. Twistleton's Light Infantry of the Guards, but were quickly repulsed by the British. William Augustus West, Lord Cantelupe,Usually referred to as Lord Cantelupe. He was formally Viscount Cantelupe, and became 3rd Earl De La Warr after the death of his father in November 1777. who was stationed with the light infantry, noted that the 4th and 23rd Regiments engaged the Americans with 9 men killed and 19 wounded. British Maj. John Andr√© reported that one American was killed. Meanwhile, the main body of Morgan's and Gist's troops engaged Howe's main column in dense woods, where they fought \\"Indian style\\", from tree to tree. The Maryland militia attacked Abercromby's 1st Light Infantry Battalion with unusual vigor: British officers, who were used to encountering militia who would flee at the first sign of battle, would later express admiration at the skill of Morgan's and Gist's men.McGuire, p. 251. McGuire cites the writings of Maj. Andr√©, Lieut. Wetherall and Col. Hangar Morgan's troops were not reinforced,McGuire, p. 252. and were forced to retreat back to the main camp after Cornwallis sent in the 33rd Regiment of Foot. British withdrawal On the morning of December 8, British generals and engineers once again studied the American positions, looking for any advantage they could exploit in the American defenses.McGuire, p. 253. Quoting the diary of British Captain-Lieutenant John Peebles To the astonishment of both the British and the Americans, Howe decided to withdraw and return to Philadelphia.McGuire, p. 254. Despite being successful in two major skirmishes over the previous days, his maneuvering had not gotten as far around the American flank as he had hoped and his troops' provisions were running low. Also, the nights were getting colder and the troops had left their tentage and gear in Philadelphia.Martin, p. 164. Mark Boatner says that Howe \\"decided that Washington's defenses were too strong to warrant the risk of a general assault.Boatner, p. 1200 At 2:00 pm, the British began their withdrawal, lighting numerous campfires‚Äîin a tactic similar to one used by Washington three days prior‚Äîto conceal their movements. An American reconnaissance party, led by Capt. McLane, discovered that Howe was marching back down Old York Road into Philadelphia and communicated this information back to Washington. Morgan's troops harassed the enemy's rear, in particular Grey's column, which was hindered by the weight of the artillery that it was transporting.Ward, p. 381. A contingent of Hessians formed to oppose them with their fieldpieces and Morgan's troops retreated. The British arrived in Philadelphia later that day. Casualties No American official casualty return from December 5 to 8 is known to exist. Some information, however, can be pieced together from various sources. For December 5, David Martin says that General Irvine's force took about 40 casualties,Martin, p. 161 while a Loyalist officer with the British Army wrote that Irvine was captured along with 23 of his men.McGuire, p. 242 For December 6, Howard Peckham says that the Americans lost 30 killed, 40 wounded and 15 captured.Peckham, p. 45 The figure of 15 prisoners taken was confirmed by John Andr√© in his journal.McGuire, p. 246 For December 7, Colonel John Laurens stated that ‚Äúthe loss of Morgan's riflemen was 27 killed and wounded‚Äù,McGuire, p. 252 while John Donaldson, an American cavalryman wrote that ‚ÄúMorgan had 44 killed & wounded & among them was Major Morris a brave & gallant officer‚ÄùMcGuire, p. 253 This reference was to Major Joseph Morris of the 1st New Jersey Regiment, so Donaldson's figure was evidently for the whole force under Morgan's command, while Laurens' figure was for the Corps of Riflemen only. Benson Lossing confirms that ‚Äútwenty-seven were killed and wounded in Morgan's Corps‚Äù, while Major Morris was badly wounded and the Maryland Militia lost ‚Äú16 or 17‚Äù wounded.Lossing, p. 321 For December 8, David Martin says that the Maryland Militia lost 20 killed or wounded and 15 prisoners.Martin, p. 163 From these sources, the aggregate American loss from December 5‚Äì8 would appear to have been 16 killed or wounded and 24 captured on the 5th; 70 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 6th; 44 killed or wounded on the 7th and 20 killed or wounded and 15 captured on the 8th. This gives 150 killed or wounded and 54 captured, for a total loss of 204 men. Lord Cantelupe wrote in his diary that \\"the number of killed & wounded on our side amount to one hundred & twenty, one officer killed.McGuire, p. 249 Cantelupe's figure agrees approximately with Howe's official casualty return for ‚Äúthe different skirmishes from 4th to 8th December‚Äù, which gives 19 killed, 60 wounded and 33 missing. David Martin gives the total British loss, including deserters, as 350, which would suggest that 238 men deserted. Aftermath Washington, frustrated at not being able to confront Howe in a more decisive action, wrote in his report to Henry Laurens, president of Congress, \\"I sincerely wish, that they had made an Attack; the Issue in all probability, from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of our Camp, would have been fortunate and happy. At the same time I must add that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbade us quitting our post to attack them. Nothing but Success would have justified the measure, and this could not be expected from their position.\\"The writings of George Washington from the original manuscript sources: Volume 10 ‚Äì Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library, accessed September 21, 2006 On December 11, the Continental Army left White Marsh for Valley Forge. It took the soldiers eight days to make the journey. The following April, Howe resigned his post and returned to Britain,Martin p.181 and was replaced by Gen. Sir Henry Clinton. Following France's entry into the war, the British evacuated Philadelphia overland the following spring, and while en route to New York City, they were attacked by Washington at the Battle of Monmouth.Martin, p.212 Remains of the American redoubts were visible near Farmar Mill, as were vestiges of stone chimneys from the soldier's makeshift huts, as late as 1860.Lossing, p. 115. The battle is alluded to in Sally Wister's Journal, and the author later views the remains of the nearby camp.Sally Wister's Journal: A True Narrative: Being a Quaker Maiden's Account of Her Experiences with Officers of the Continental Army, 1777‚Äì1779, Ferris & Leach, Philadelphia, 1902, entries for Dec. 7, 1777, and Feb. 30 , 1778. Fort Washington State Park, which encompasses a portion of the area occupied by the American forces, was established in the early 1920s by Philadelphia's Fairmount Park Commission and is today managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The park's Fort Hill marks the spot where a temporary fort once stood at the western end of the American position. The Pennsylvania Militia (under Gens. Armstrong, Cadwalader and Irvine) held positions on the park's Militia Hill. Nearby, Emlen House, Washington's headquarters between November 2 and December 11, remains standing despite destructive modernization in 1854.Eberlein, p. 287.

The first train, known as \\"The Whooper,\\"Richart Ellington, \\"All Aboard the Carrsboro Whooper!\\", April 12, 2015, http://chapelboro.com/lifestyle/aboard-carrboro-whooper/, retrieved 4/17/2005. was a locomotive and two passenger cars that made the run from University Station to Chapel Hill Station twice daily. The trip from university station to Chapel Hill Station took an hour traveling southbound and seventy minutes northbound. The current town of Carrboro, then known as West End, started to grow as a result of the railroad. Elizabeth 'Libba' Cotten wrote the famous song \\"Freight Train\\" as a young teenager, inspired mainly by the train that for years passed behind her house on Lloyd Street in Carrboro. The company still exists as a subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Railway. Passenger service ended in 1936.

Life Vogel first studied composition in Moscow with Alexander Scriabin, then between 1918 and 1924 with Heinz Tiessen and Ferruccio Busoni in Berlin, where he subsequently taught (1929‚Äì33) at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory. He was close to the expressionist circle around Herwarth Walden and was active (together with George Antheil, Hanns Eisler, Philipp Jarnach, Stefan Wolpe, and Kurt Weill) in the music section of the November Group of Max Butting and Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt. In 1933, branded a ‚Äúdegenerate artist‚Äù by the Nazi regime, he left Germany and went to Strasbourg, Brussels, Paris, and London. He first turned to twelve-tone technique with his Violin Concerto in 1937. From 1939 he lived in Switzerland, at first in Ascona and from 1964 in Z√ºrich. Until he became a Swiss citizen in 1954, he was not allowed to work in Switzerland, and relied on the support of wealthy patrons and his wife, the writer Aline Valangin. During this time, he taught composition privately, was active in the ISCM, participated in Hermann Scherchen‚Äôs ‚ÄòSessions d‚Äô√©tudes musicales et dramatiques‚Äô in Strasbourg, and organized the International Twelve-Tone Music pre-conference in Osilina in 1949.

Johannes Nauclerus (Naucler, Naukler) ( 1425 ‚Äì May 1, 1510) was a 16th-century Swabian historian and humanist. He was born Johann Vergenhans to a noble (or knighted) man of the same name. As was the fashion of the time, the family's name had been Latinized, with nauclerus, meaning \\"skipper,\\" being a close translation of Vergenhans, meaning \\"ferryman.\\" The family's coat of arms depicted a man on a sailing ship. Nauclerus became a doctor of law in 1450 and supervisor to Count Eberhard V of W√ºrttemberg. In 1460, he was head of the church in Stuttgart. He seems to have spent some time in Italy, and had contact with Pope Pius II. From 1464 to 1465 he taught at the University of Basel, and in 1466 he was in Rome. In 1477 he became first rector at the University of T√ºbingen and subsequently its second chancellor. In 1502, Nauclerus assumed the office of a judge of the Swabian League, which he held until his death. Work He is the author of the World Chronicle (Memorabilium omnis aetatis et omnium gentium chronici commentarii, 1516), printed posthumously, with its foreword written by Johann Reuchlin. The work chronicled the centuries from the time of Adam to the year 1500. This work did not follow the traditional temporal divisions of \\"ages\\" (aetates) and \\"realms\\" (regna), but adhered to a division based on generations. Written in Latin and on the suggestion of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, it described Biblical events, such as the building of the Tower of Babel, as well as events from Greek mythology, such as the Trojan War. Also included were historical events such as the burning of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence (1498). Nauclerus consulted an unusually large number of different sources (such as an account by Eilmer of Malmesbury), indicating that he was already committed to the new spirit of humanism. Some of the sources he consulted no longer exist; their contents are only known through Nauclerus' work. This work was known to Ortelius through Franciscus Irenicus. Erasmus also wrote a laudatory foreword. Other works include his Tractatus de symonia perutilis (T√ºbingen, 1500). Legacy *Nauklerstra√üe (\\"Naukler Street\\"), in T√ºbingen, is named after him.

He was a prominent North Carolina industrialist who built the Alberta Cotton Mill in 1898 in Carrboro; the former factory building is now home to the Carr Mill Mall. He was part of a prominent family that settled in Orange County in the 1750-60s. After serving in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War in Company L, North Carolina 17th Infantry Regiment, Lloyd returned to his native Orange County. He quickly recognized the economic possibilities of the newly constructed State University Railroad in the town of West End, which is now known as Carrboro, and bought property adjacent to the railroad. There, Lloyd and a business partner, William Pritchard, built a steam-powered grist mill and cotton gin in 1883. This building, currently known as the Broad Street Building, still stands between Carr Mill Mall and the former railroad depot. In 1886, he bought out Pritchard's share in the grist mill and cotton gin, and had a flour mill built on the property.Brown, Claudia R., Burgess McSwain, John Florin, and Jane Hamborsky. Carrboro, N.C.: An Architectural & Historical Inventory. Carrboro Appearance Commission, Town of Carrboro, 1983. 11. In 1898, he built the Alberta Cotton Mill on the same property, spurring economic growth in the area. Lloyd had numerous mill houses built for his workers, some of which are still historic points of interest in the town. In March 1909, North Carolina industrialist Julian S. Carr purchased the Alberta Cotton Mill from Lloyd. In February 1910, Lloyd, his brother Lueco, Isaac W. Pritchard, and W.S. Roberson formed a partnership and organized the Thomas F. Lloyd Manufacturing Company. They had a new mill constructed a few blocks south of the original Alberta Mill; construction was completed by mid-1911. This mill was also later purchased by Carr and the Durham Hosiery Mills.Brown, Claudia R., Burgess McSwain, John Florin, and Jane Hamborsky. Carrboro, N.C.: An Architectural & Historical Inventory. Carrboro Appearance Commission, Town of Carrboro, 1983. 13-14. Lloyd never learned to read or write until late in his life (having never received any formal education), though he displayed great business acumen and skill. At one point, Lloyd became the richest man in Carrboro and Chapel Hill. In 1885, Lloyd and his first wife, Caroline, purchased a brick, two-story antebellum home located at 412 West Cameron Avenue in Chapel Hill, now known as the Mason-Lloyd-Wiley House (built in 1860). Lloyd died May 24, 1911, in Chapel Hill, and is buried in the Bethel Baptist Church cemetery located on 9326 Bethel Hickory Grove west of Chapel Hill. There is a Thomas F. Lloyd Historic District (placed on the National Register August 14, 1986) in Carrboro that encompasses the mill village where residents of Lloyd's 1911 mill lived.

It is a forest-dwelling bird endemic to the Seychelles where it is native to the island of La Digue. Males have glossy black plumage with elongated tail feathers, while females are reddish-brown with pale underparts and no long tail feathers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this bird as being \\"critically endangered\\" and attempts have been made to increase its numbers by relocating some individuals to Denis Island, another island in the Seychelles archipelago. Taxonomy and Systematics An alternate common name for the Seychelles paradise flycatcher is the Seychelles black paradise-flycatcher. Description The length of the males is about 20 cm. In addition there are two long black central tail feathers which can reach a length of 30 cm. The females can reach a length between 16 and 18 cm (including the tail). The males are entirely glossy black with a deep blue sheen. The upperparts of the females including wings and tail are reddish brown. The underparts are pale cream white. Facial skin, bill, and legs are blue. Distribution It lives in the Veuve Nature Reserve on La Digue, Seychelles, where it inhabits dense Calophyllum forests. Although a reservation was made especially for this bird, it is common to see it outside in the trees or even in the garden of the Seychellois people. Plans were made to get this bird back into the wild on other islands of the Seychelles. Ecology It preys on insects in flight or from a perch. It also feeds on larvae and spiders. The oval bowl-shaped nest is built on branches and consists of twigs, palm fibre, and spider webs. Both parents, male and female, take care of the little bird until it grows up and each of them provides it with food, mainly in the form of flies for which it got its name. Conservation status The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists this bird as being \\"critically endangered\\". The threats it faces are a result of its specific habitat requirements which are incompatible with the habitat loss and fragmentation taking place on La Digue, due to increasing tourism and the expansion of settlements. Numbers of birds are thought to be in the low hundreds, and in an effort to improve its long-term hopes of survival, it has been introduced to Denis Island where there are no mammalian predators. 23 birds were moved to Denis Island in 2008 and have since successfully bred there.

The Thai word tham can be used to refer both to \\"morality\\", and \\"dharma\\", the teachings of Buddhism. Phak Phalang Tham was a political party, not to be confused with its precursor, Ruam Phalang (\\"collective force\\"), the campaign group that backed Chamlong Srimuang in the 1985 Bangkok gubernatorial election. To some extent, the PDP evolved into a political party from Ruam Phalang. The latter group was largely made up of Santi Asoke devotees, former Young Turks, and other political activists and community leaders. Many of the PDP's early members were drawn from the ranks of Ruam Phalang. Foundation and overview The Palang Dharma Party was founded by Chamlong Srimuang in May 1988. A retired major general and former governor of Bangkok, Chamlong was a devout Buddhist with strong ties to the Santi Asoke sect; he is known for his current vows of chastity, his vegetarianism and his strict adherence to the Eight Precepts of Buddhism. Although Chamlong won the 1985 election for Bangkok governor as an independent backed by Ruam Phalang, in the following years Chamlong's political future seemed to be increasingly compromised by his lack of backing by a formal political party. Ahead of the 1988 general election, he founded the Palang Dharma Party, although only after gaining the approval of an initially reluctant Phra Photirak, the founder and leader of the Santi Asoke Buddhist sect. As the election day approached, Santi Asoke members, including Photirak, provided out massive support for the new political party. Chamlong Srimuang, party founder, leader 1988‚Äì1992 Chamlong founded the party in an attempt to \\"purify\\" Thai politics, as rampant corruption was often used to justify military coups d'√©tat. With the Palang Dharma Party, a new type of politics was introduced to Thailand. The party's program was based on Buddhist principles. However the popularity of its leader contributed more to the party's success than its political platform. Palang Dharma was particularly popular with the urban middle-class in the Bangkok region. There it won 49 out of 55 seats in the 1990 elections for the Bangkok City Council and 32 out of 35 seats in the 1992 parliamentary election. Palang Dharma became a major force in Thai politics during the early-1990s. Its leader Chamlong was a key figure in the 1992 middle class protests against the military rule of Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon, commonly known as the Black May, that led to the resignation of Suchinda. Platform policy and principles In June 1988, the Palang Dharma Party released a brief \\"platform policy\\" document, submitted to the Interior Ministry as part of the required party registration procedures. The majority of the party's policies, presented under five headings in eighteen numbered points, were relatively general in nature; they included \\"improving the quality of the bureaucracy, fighting corruption, decentralizing power, spreading wealth to the countryside, supporting increased employment, and creating a better military\\". According to Southeast Asian politics specialist Duncan McCargo, there were definite advantages to the \\"vagueness\\" of this document. Firstly, the policy program revealed nothing about the wide range of conflicting views that existed within the political party, even upon its founding; that is, certain members' preferences for European-style democratic elements, the \\"village socialism\\" favored by Santi Asoke devotees, or the \\"ethical capitalism\\" supported by the more successful business-minded members. Furthermore, the lack of clearly delineated and specific policy promises in the Palang Dharma's publications gave elected party members the freedom to make policies as they saw fit down the road. More significant than the Palang Dharma Party's policies themselves, however, was its Buddhist-inspired ideology of \\"virtuous politics\\". The Palang Dharma Pledge, which could be found in Palang Dharma's policy booklet, outlined four objectives: to act only \\"in accordance with morality\\", to refrain from vote-buying, not to lie, and not to aspire to political office. According to Chamlong, the purpose of the party was not to serve its members' personal desires to further their political careers, but rather to set an example \\"which might inspire the formation of other parties with similar principles, leading to a radical change in Thai political culture\\". Specifically, in terms of social policies, Palang Dharma hoped to encourage people \\"to lead clean, diligent, frugal, honest, and self-sacrificing daily lives\\". In the end, however, beyond the seemingly unifying umbrella cause of \\"morality\\" and anti-corruption taken up by the Palang Dharma Party, what ultimately appears to have held the party together, at least for a time, was the tenuous leadership and popularity of Chamlong himself. Factions Throughout its existence, the party suffered from the division between the Santi Asoke members like Chamlong who intransigently insisted on their principles and rejected compromise (the so-called \\"temple\\" faction), and its pragmatic faction of secular politicians who wanted to advance their careers and the party's influence. The \\"temple faction\\", or \\"believers\\", fundamentally rejected the role of money in Thai politics, but advocated self-sacrifice, hard work, sincerity and morality, even if this should mean to confine the role of the party to one of a minor, uninfluential, oppositional party. The secular faction, or \\"careerists\\", on the other hand were convinced that, in order to lead the country's development in the right direction, the party had to expand, to invite capable professionals and business people, to forge alliances and to join the government. The \\"temple faction\\" deemed the pragmatists to be opportunistic and suspected them of capitalising on the good reputation of the party and its founder. The \\"careerists\\" again considered the \\"believers\\" naive, out of touch with reality and unelectable if standing alone. Party leader Chamlong was able to use this factionalism to his benefit. He played off the factions against each other to defend and stabilize his own top position. He presented convincing, reasonable professionals as the party's figureheads, while the \\"temple faction\\" embodied the party's conscience and sought to tame some representatives' ambitions. Chamlong impinged upon the party's leadership elections, and threatened to resign when he felt his authority challenged. Role of Santi Asoke in the 1988 General Election The July 1988 general election marked the first time members of the Palang Dharma Party would run for elective office since the party's creation only two months prior. Although hesitant at first to endorse the creation of the Palang Dharma Party publicly, as the election approached, Santi Asoke members, including the Buddhist sect's founder, Phra Phothirak, showed their support for the party in a number of ways. For one, in order be recognized as an official party, the PDP was obligated to meet the Interior Ministry's party registration standards, including presenting evidence of having reached the legally required minimum of five thousand members belonging to various parts of the country. Such a requirement would have proven difficult, had it not been for the remarkable breadth of Santi Asoke's network of adherents; the required amount of signatures was quickly acquired within days, ultimately totaling 10,310 names at the time of submission. In addition, the Palang Dharma Party chose to vie for over 300 parliamentary seats, a greater number than any other party at the time. Close to half of the PDP candidates selected to run were Santi Asoke followers. Unlike those who belonged to Ruam Phalang in 1985, the newly created PDP's members in 1988 were not simply campaigning on behalf of Chamlong; that is, a single charismatic personality. Rather, they themselves were candidates in the running. Chamlong had won the public over in the 1985 Bangkok gubernatorial election with his memorable and impressive ascetic Buddhist lifestyle, convincing voters of his sincerity, integrity, and modesty. Constituents admired the ethics of the former major general who, as a successful individual and well-known public figure, had given up his worldly possessions in order to live in a way that won over the urban poor. In comparison, these new Palang Dharma candidates who presented themselves in \\"peasant garb\\", promoted chastity and vegetarianism, and denounced materialistic temptations were initially perceived by some of the electorate as \\"oddities, people out of sympathy with ordinary needs and popular opinion\\" who had left behind \\"normal\\" Thai society in their moral quest for purity. In addition, the fact that Chamlong himself refrained from running for a seat in the 1988 election did nothing to improve the public's early impressions of the fledgling political party. Lastly, prior to the election, a number of prominent \\"moral\\" figures, including Police Colonel Seri Temiyavej, withdrew their potential candidacies, further weakening the PDP's party base. Nevertheless, Chamlong's popularity and the large number of candidates put forth by the Palang Dharma Party appeared to endanger the positions of already-established political parties in the Thai Parliament. For the Prachakorn Thai Party leader Samak Sundaravej in particular, the rise of the PDP posed a direct threat to Samak's prime ministerial aspirations. Thus as part of their election strategy, Samak and his Prachakorn Thai Party attempted to discredit the burgeoning PDP by linking it heavily to Santi Asoke throughout their 1988 campaign. The Prachakorn Thai Party was well equipped to pursue such a tactic, given the strong, cohesive internal dynamics of the party's experienced campaign team. Their cause resonated with the Parian Tham Association, a conservative Buddhist organization which denounced Santi Asoke's \\"illegality\\" (due to its claim that it was not under the jurisdiction of sangha authority) and the sect's ties to the Palang Dharma Party. In June 1988, a Prachakorn Thai Party member admitted that his party had aided the organization in printing and distributing around 50,000 leaflets which condemned the PDP throughout Bangkok. Unfortunately, the fact Santi Asoke had made no secret of its affiliation with the Palang Dharma Party proved to be the latter's undoing in the 1988 election campaign. Political opponents exploited this connection, pointing to \\"slip-ups\\" such as that of Dokya, the Santi Asoke magazine, which had labeled the emerging PDP as a \\"golden dream\\" and had quoted Phothirak as having said \\"religion and politics were one and the same\\". By this point, what had begun as a campaign strategy to discredit Chamlong and his PDP had escalated into a full-scale inquisition of the Santi Asoke sect, as orthodox sangha members became involved. Phra Sophon Ganabhorn, the assistant abbot of Wat Bowonniwet, the most prestigious royal temple in Bangkok, denounced Santi Asoke as a potential \\"threat to the stability of Buddhism in Thailand\\". The abbot went on to claim that \\"As a top administrator who could become prime minister in the future, [Chamlong] should not support Santi Asoke, which has introduced a dangerous cult that could be dangerous to national security\\". Underlying this criticism is the implication that having Palang Dharma Party members in parliament would seem to legitimize Santi Asoke, and by extension appear to allow for the creation of a new Thai Buddhist order which would disrupt religious and political stability within the nation. Ultimately, while the Palang Dharma Party's founder Chamrong Srimuang was successful in winning Bangkok governorship in 1985 on his anti- corruption and Buddhist principles-inspired platform, the PDP was not as fortunate in its 1988 general election results. Of 357 total seats in Parliament, the PDP won only 14; that is, 3.9 percent of the available seats. Testifying to the effects of the harmful press against Santi Asoke, of the few newly elected PDP members of parliament, only one was a Santi Asoke follower. The other thirteen MPs were elected on the basis of other, more \\"traditional\\" reasons: they had previous parliamentary experience, they held high positions in the military, they were medical doctors or had a PhD, etc. In the following years the Palang Dharma Party would grow in popularity, especially within Bangkok, due in great part to the continued popularity of its founder. The PDP would go on to win admirable victories in both the March and September 1992 general elections (41 and 47 seats, respectively), as well as a reasonably healthy number of seats in the July 1995 election (23 seats). Government participation Thaksin Shinwatra, party leader 1995‚Äì1996 After 1992, Chamlong passed on the chairmanship to business tycoon and former Social Action Party politician Boonchu Rojanastien, but remained the party's de facto leader until 1995. After the parliamentary election in September 1992, Phalang Dharma joined a Democrat-led government coalition under Chuan Leekpai, but retired from it in 1995, depriving Chuan of his parliamentary majority and forcing him to resign. This led to several members leaving the party and the leadership was handed over to Prime Minister-to-be Thaksin Shinawatra, an exponent of the pragmatist faction. Role of Thaksin Shinawatra Already a successful businessman at the time, Thaksin Shinawatra joined the Palang Dharma Party in November 1994, taking the post of a Cabinet foreign minister, marking his political debut. Thaksin identified with the \\"pragmatist\\" faction of the Palang Dharma Party, as opposed to the \\"temple\\" faction largely formed by Santi Asoke devotees such as PDP founder Chamlong Srimuang. Indeed, at the time of his entry to the party, Thaksin's career could have been described as \\"single-mindedly dedicated to the pursuit of wealth\\", standing in stark opposition to that of \\"temple\\" faction party members who practiced lifestyles of thrift and moderation. Despite their apparent differences with Chamlong's religious principles, Thaksin as well as other wealthy \\"new-generation Bangkok businessmen\\" were reputedly drawn to the PDP due to its anti-corruption agenda and its promotion of \\"new-style\\" politics. Thaksin's joining the Palang Dharma Party exacerbated existing conflict within the party. Specifically, a great number of PDP members objected to his holding the post of foreign minister, criticizing the appointment of \\"outsiders\\" such as new-generation businessmen to cabinet positions. Furthermore, after Chamlong relinquished party leadership to Thaksin in 1995, under the soon-to-be prime minister's leadership, the PDP moved in a direction increasingly distant from its founding Buddhist-inspired principles, thus further widening the divide between divergent party factions. Thaksin himself, as the face of the Phalang Dharma Party, served to further diminish the party's reputation with the public. Specifically, according to British writer Chris Baker and Thai economist Pasuk Phongpaichit, whereas Chamlong had steered the PDP in the direction of \\"cleaner and more principled politics\\", \\"...in the public mind, Thaksin was a concession hunter associated with some of the most flagrant 'money politicians'... and with the corrupt and discredited 1991-2 coup junta.\\" On the subject of the PDP's eventual collapse in 1996 whilst under the leadership of Thaksin, Southeast Asian politics specialist Duncan McCargo writes, \\"In effect, Thaksin had‚Äîin the space of twelve months‚Äîdestroyed the bulk of the political 'credit' built up by Chamlong and the Phalang Tham over eleven years of hard work in the capital. Phalang Tham had become part of the problem with Thai politics, rather than part of the solution.\\" Decline Under Thaksin the party moved away from religious policies and joined the coalition government of Banharn Silpa-archa, in which Thaksin served as deputy prime minister. From that time on, the party declined. By 1996, the Palang Dharma Party had fallen into near-total collapse due to factional conflicts within the party. The final decisive blow was struck in the November 1996 election, in which the PDP managed to procure only a single parliamentary seat, a devastating result compared to its respectable 23 seats won in the last election of July 1995. Almost immediately following the PDP's sobering electoral defeat, party leader Thaksin resigned from his top position. He cited the Democrats' landslide victory as an indicator of voters' demands from the new government: \\"a prime minister and a good economic team\\" in the face of economic hard times, a package neatly offered by the Democrats' \\"cure for economy\\" campaign pledge. Thaksin went on to say, \\"What we [the PDP] have done [through Parliament in the past] has been rejected by society. We offered the best we could. We have never done anything bad.\\" That is, in terms of the latter remark, Palang Dharma had supposedly \\"always gone by the ethics, never bought votes and none of its ministers have ever been cited for corruption\\". Following his resignation, Thaksin expressed his belief that the PDP would remain struggling for continued existence and growth due to \\"its own limitations caused by its strict adherence to principles\\". Specifically, while the former party leader professed having great respect for the underlying ideology of the PDP, he believed it nevertheless failed to \\"adjust its thinking to keep up with the modern world\\", having found the party to be \\"too innocent\\", \\"disorganized\\", and \\"backward looking\\" in his time at the PDP's helm. Chamlong ran again for governor of Bangkok in 1996, but lost and left politics. Despite the political ground lost by the PDP in 1996 and in the following years, Buddhist criticism of the political establishment, as represented by Palang Dharma, and Chamlong's campaign for \\"clean politics\\" can be seen as one of the factors that led to the 1998 constitutional change. On 14 July 1998, Thaksin launched the Thai Rak Thai Party, which was joined by many former Phalang Dharma leaders. Chairmen * Maj.

He was active in Brescia and near Bergamo. He was born to a poor mason in Clusone. After some local training. Cifrondi moved to Bologna with Marcantonio Franceschini, a member of the Cignani circle. He traveled to Turin with his younger brother Ventura, but was not successful in finding work. (Scotti, G. page, 167) He stayed in Rome during 1675‚Äì1680. He briefly worked in the Palace of Versailles under Le Brun, but was dismissed before the age of 30.(Scotti, G. page, 168) He lived in the Benedictine convent of San Faustino in the last decade of his life. He may have met the fellow northern Italian genre painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi. He influenced Giuseppe Roncelli. He is known by canvases mainly during 1722‚Äì1730. He often painted aged men or people at work. In 1897, a historian of Bergamo described him as one the adventurers who vaguely foreseeing the advent of a new era ... gave a sign of a nervous agitation and a restlessness, and felt need to get out of the narrow circle of village life, traveling and observing a little of everything, somewhat eager for fresh air and brighter light. He describes him as always poor but full of cheer.

It is considered the first modern political movement in China. Leaders of the movement later became leaders of the Hundred Days' Reform. Events In 1895, China was defeated by Japan in the First Sino-Japanese War and was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan and Liaodong to Japan in perpetuity, and imposed reparation obligations of 200 million taels of silver on China. At the time, the imperial civil service examination was in progress in Beijing. When news reached the candidates, they became agitated, especially candidates from Taiwan whose province was about to become Japanese. Five days after the signature of the treaty, on April 22, civil examination candidates led by Kang Youwei signed a ten-thousand-word petition to the Emperor, against the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The petition had 5 main points: * Cancellation the Treaty of Shimonoseki * Refusal of peace talks with Japan * Movement of the capital to Xi'an * Modernization of Qing Imperial Army * Implementation of Reforms After the Qing Government refused, on May 2, thousands of Beijing scholars and citizens protested against the Treaty of Shimonoseki in front of the Ducha Yuan. Name The name of this incident, Gongche Shangshu, literally means \\"Public Vehicle Petition\\". Gongche, or \\"Public Vehicle\\", was a poetic name for civil service candidates from various provinces, and is an allusion to the practice in the Han dynasty where candidates would be transported to the capital by publicly funded transport. Legacy Although the movement was unsuccessful in asking the Qing Government to start reforms, many people in the traditional Chinese community began to realise the importance of reforms. Leaders of the movement such as Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Tan Sitong and Yan Fu started publishing newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities, thus raising the attention of the emperor, who later invited them to enter the government to implement reforms. Although both the movement and later the reforms in 1898 failed, many scholars in big cities turned from supporting the traditional thinking to support reforms or revolution.

Pearson was most likely sent by Percival Willoughby to access the agricultural potential of the colony and surroundings. He had found little in the way of establishing a farming business but he did collect much information on the wildlife. Pearson had taken part in John Guy's expedition to Trinity Bay to find and make friends with the Beothuk. On their return trip, the boat was shipwrecked at Bay de Verde. The survivors were forced to walk to Carbonear where they found a boat and finally returned to Cuper's Cove.

Therefore, it argues that we exist neither in closed horizons, nor within a horizon that is unique. People come from different backgrounds and it is not possible to totally remove oneself from one's background, history, culture, gender, language, education, etc. to an entirely different system of attitudes, beliefs and ways of thinking.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Hans-George Gadamer, Sect. 3.2: The Happening of Tradition People may be looking for a way to be engaged in understanding a conversation or dialogue about different cultures and the speaker interprets texts or stories based on his or her past experience and prejudice.

The libretto was by Ottavio Rinuccini, who reused some of the material in the first opera Dafne in 1597. The art form known as opera originated in Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, though it drew upon older traditions of medieval and Renaissance courtly entertainment. The word opera, meaning \\"work\\" in Italian, was first used in the modern musical and theatrical sense in 1639 and soon spread to the other European languages. The earliest operas were modest productions compared to other Renaissance forms of sung drama, but they soon became more lavish and took on the spectacular stagings of the earlier genre known as intermedio. Dafne by Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today,This is not agreed by all authorities, see Grout and Williams, 41 (footnote) for references to other views. although with only five instrumental parts it was much more like a chamber opera than either the preceding intermedi or the operas of Claudio Monteverdi a few years later. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate Florentine humanists who gathered as the \\"Camerata\\". Significantly, Dafne was an attempt to revive the classical Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the Renaissance. The members of the Camerata considered that the \\"chorus\\" parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of \\"restoring\\" this situation. The libretto was by Ottavio Rinuccini, who had written some of the 1587 Medici intermedi, in which Peri had also been involved; Rinuccini appears to have recycled some of the material, at least from the scene illustrated at right. Most of the music for \\"Dafne\\" is lost (the libretto was printed and survives), but one of Peri's many later operas, Euridice, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. Traditions of staged sung music and drama go back to both secular and religious forms from the Middle Ages, and at the time opera first appears the Italian intermedio had courtly equivalents in various countries.  Etymology  The Italian word opera means \\"work\\", both in the sense of the labor done and the result produced. The Italian word in turn derives from the Latin opera. Opera is also the Latin plural of opus, with the same root, but the word opera was a singular Latin noun in its own right, and according to Lewis and Short, in Latin \\"opus is used mostly of the mechanical activity of work, as that of animals, slaves, and soldiers; opera supposes a free will and desire to serve\\". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Italian word was first used in the sense \\"composition in which poetry, dance, and music are combined\\" in 1639; the first recorded English usage in this sense dates to 1648.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed., s.v. \\"opera\\". Italian origins of opera Peri's works, however, did not arise out of a creative vacuum in the area of sung drama. An underlying prerequisite for the creation of opera proper was the practice of monody. Monody is the solo singing/setting of a dramatically conceived melody, designed to express the emotional content of the text it carries, which is accompanied by a relatively simple sequence of chords rather than other polyphonic parts. Italian composers began composing in this style late in the 16th century, and it grew in part from the long-standing practise of performing polyphonic madrigals with one singer accompanied by an instrumental rendition of the other parts, as well as the rising popularity of more popular, more homophonic vocal genres such as the frottola and the villanella. In these latter two genres, the increasing tendency was toward a more homophonic texture, with the top part featuring an elaborate, active melody, and the lower ones (usually these were three-part compositions, as opposed to the four-or-more-part madrigal) a less active supporting structure. From this, it was only a small step to fully-fledged monody. All such works tended to set humanist poetry of a type that attempted to imitate Petrarch and his Trecento followers, another element of the period's tendency toward a desire for restoration of principles it associated with a mixed-up notion of antiquity. Jacopo Peri as Arion in La pellegrina The solo madrigal, frottola, villanella and their kin featured prominently in the intermedio or intermezzo, theatrical spectacles with music that were funded in the last seventy years of the 16th century by the opulent and increasingly secular courts of Italy's city-states. Such spectacles, were usually staged to commemorate significant state events: weddings, military victories, and the like, and alternated in performance with the acts of plays. Like the later opera, an intermedi featured the aforementioned solo singing, but also madrigals performed in their typical multi-voice texture, and dancing accompanied by the present instrumentalists. They were lavishly staged, and led the scenography of the second half of the 16th century. The intermedi tended not to tell a story as such, although they occasionally did, but nearly always focused on some particular element of human emotion or experience, expressed through mythological allegory. The staging in 1600 of Peri's opera Euridice as part of the celebrations for a Medici wedding, the occasions for the most spectacular and internationally famous intermedi of the previous century, was probably a crucial development for the new form, putting it in the mainstream of lavish courtly entertainment. Another popular court entertainment at this time was the \\"madrigal comedy\\", later also called \\"madrigal opera\\" by musicologists familiar with the later genre. This consisted of a series of madrigals strung together to suggest a dramatic narrative, but not staged.Grout and Williams, 33 There were also two staged musical \\"pastoral\\"s, Il Satiro and La Disperazione di Fileno, both produced in 1590 and written by Emilio de' Cavalieri. Although these lost works seem only to have included arias, with no recitative, they were apparently what Peri was referring to, in his preface to the published edition of his Euridice, when he wrote: \\"Signor Emilio del Cavalieri, before any other of whom I know, enabled us to hear our kind of music upon the stage\\".JSTOR Peri and Corsi's \\"Dafne\\": Some New Discoveries and Observations, William V. Porter; Journal of the American Musicological Society, Vol. 18, No. 2 (Summer, 1965), p. 170 Other pastoral plays had long included some musical numbers; one of the earliest, La fabula d'Orfeo (1480) by Poliziano had at least three solo songs and one chorus.Grout and Williams, 30 The French ballet de cour and the English masque Staging of Orpheus and Amphion for a princely wedding in D√ºsseldorf in 1585 In addition to opera in Italy, developing concurrently in the late 16th-early 17th centuries were the particular national forms of the French ballet de cour, as part of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals, and the English masque, which were similar to the Italian intermedi in many respects, including an emphasis on spectacular staging. In both cases, the main difference apart from local musical style was a greater degree of audience participation in the form of staged or processional dances. At this time, of course, the audience consisted primarily of invited nobles and courtiers, although the 1589 Medici intermedi were repeated three times for a wider audience. The English masque also featured a culminating \\"revel,\\" in which the performers drifted into and cavorted with the audience. Opera was imported into both countries by the middle of the 17th century, where it fused with the local incipient genres. This led to the dominance of ballet in opera of the French tradition. The first German opera Sch√ºtz's Dafne (1627) was the first lost German opera, though Staden's Seelewig (1644) is the first surviving German opera. The first English opera In England the masque tradition was too strongly associated with the court of Charles I to survive the outbreak of the English Civil War. Although, rather improbably, it was under the totalitarian and puritanical regime of Oliver Cromwell that the first Opera in English, The Siege of Rhodes, was produced in 1656, opera received no encouragement from that regime, and no subsidy from the post-Restoration government of Charles II, who preferred comedies and those who acted in them. This lack of financial backing, and the thriving English tradition of incidental music, made it difficult for Italian- style opera to take hold there. Instead the English semi-opera developed, although these were not produced in very large numbers. Even after imported Italian operas began to be staged, English composers were extremely slow to attempt the genre. Other ancestors of opera Religious In earlier times, music had been part of medieval mystery plays, with the composer of these best known to modern audiences being Hildegard of Bingen. Whether these are to be regarded as possible progenitors of opera is highly debatable. Major liturgical celebrations were often dramatic to a considerable degree, featuring elaborate processions, tableaux vivants and liturgical drama; the Missa Aurea is the best-known example. A new, 17th century form of religious drama, the oratorio did arise shortly after the advent of opera, though it owes at least as much to the (originally secular) non-dramatic recitative-aria form of the cantata. Secular The origins of opera clearly lie in the court, whereas the mystery plays were normally a bourgeois form, entrusted to the guilds. But various forms of medieval court festivities combined music and drama; in the Gothic period major royal banquets, such as the Burgundian Feast of the Pheasant of 1454, were accompanied by performances, often elaborately staged re-enactments of military actions, with courtiers taking the parts. Unlike the liturgical dramas, which have survived in large numbers, at least as far as the scripts are concerned, we have only cursory descriptions of earlier court dramatic spectacles. A Royal entry was typically accompanied by various short performances, including tableaux vivants and mascarades.

H.H.Shrimad Swamiji of Shri Kavale Math is spiritual head Of Shree Shantadurga Saunsthan, Kavale. Shree Shantadurga is the Kuldevi (family deity) of many Goud Saraswat Brahman families. On 4 December 2016, (Margashirsh Shuddh Panchmi). Shree Shantadurga Devasthan,Kavale has completed its 450th year of existence. Deity The temple is dedicated to Shantadurga, the goddess who mediates between Vishnu and Shiva. The deity is also called 'Santeri' colloquially. Purana talks of a battle between Shiva and Vishnu The battle was so fierce that the God Brahma prayed to Goddess Parvati to intervene, which she did in the form of Shantadurga. Shantadurga placed Vishnu on her right hand and Shiva on her left hand and settled the fight. Shantadurga is holding two serpents, one in each hand, representing Vishnu and Shiva. Temple The original temple at Quelossim (Keloshi) in Salcete was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1566. The goddess was shifted to Kavalem and worship was continued there. The site on which the original Temple of Shantadurga stood at Quelossim (Keloshi) is known as \\"Deoolbhata\\" and it is in the possession of the Shree Shantadurga Saunsthan Committee,Kavale. The current temple was constructed during the reign of Maratha Empire King Chattrapati Shahu Maharaj of Satara during the period from 1713 AD to 1738 AD. Naroram Rege Mantri originally from Kochara village in the Vengurla Taluka,(Konkan) was a Mantri (Minister) in Chattrapati Shahu Maharaj Ashtapradhan Mandal at Satara (Grandson of Chh.Shivaji Maharaj).Due to his efforts, the village of Kavalem was bequeathed to the Temple by Shrimant Baji Rao I Peshwa in 1738. The Temple reconstruction started around 1730s. The temple complex is on the slope of the foothills of a mountain chain, surrounded by lush vegetation. There is a main temple and three smaller temples of other deities which have been built on three sides of the temple. The temple consists of a collection of pyramidal roofs with a dome. The pillars and floors are made of Kashmir stone. The temple has a huge tank, a Deepastambha and agrashalas (guest houses). Many renovations have been completed over the years to the main temple and the temples of the other deities as well as to the agrashala. The temple has recently banned entry of foreigners into the temple citing objectionable dressing and conduct as the reason. Architectural Styles Its pyramidical shape 'shikaras' rising on the roofs of the facade (entrance hall) and the 'Sabhamandap' (the main hall), its roman-arched windows, some of which have the stained-glass window panes of deep red, yellow, blue, green colours, its chandeliers, its gate posts, balustraded flat dome, the maroon-peach-white colour paint of the temple gives the temple a serene beautiful look. The highlight of the temple is its golden palanquin (palkhi) in which the deity is carried on festive occasions(only 5 Mahapanchmi).

It is widely used as a song in the Roman Catholic Cursillo movement and related communities such as the Great Banquet, Chrysalis Flight, Tres Dias, Walk to Emmaus, and Kairos Prison Ministry . It is also associated with the United Farm Workers union, as one of the most commonly heard songs sung during rallies. History and origins of the song The song is associated with Mexican folklore, but it is not known for certain when and where the song originated. It is believed to have been in circulation throughout the Americas since the 16th century, with melodies being brought over from Spain during the colonial era. Some versions of the lyrics sung today are widely understood to have been created by a group of Cursillo participants in Majorca, Spain, after one of the earliest Cursillo retreats in the 1940s. Today, in addition to being used as the unofficial anthem of the Farm Worker Movement and as an inspirational song in Cursillo workshops, the song is often taught in schools in the United States‚Äîfrom elementary school to community colleges‚Äîas an example of a common Mexican folk song. It frequently appears in collections of children's songs. Common song words De colores is typically sung in Spanish, but there are different English translations of the song in circulation, and the song has been translated into other languages. The lyrics depict an expression of joy and a celebration of all creation with its many bright colors. Below are four of the most commonly heard verses. Many additional verses (and variations of these verses) are known to exist, some including Christian references and some including more specific to farm life or labor union issues to be used as a rallying-song for farm-laborers.

The total area of the park is . It is located southeast of Bia≈Çystok (Poland). It is known for the protection of the best preserved part of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest, Europe's last temperate primaeval forest fragment that once stretched across the European Plain. It is home to the world's largest population of European bison (), the continent's heaviest land animals. The border between the two countries runs through the forest, the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park is adjacent on the Belarus side of the border. There is a border crossing for hikers and cyclists within the forest. According to one study, the park brings in tourist revenues of about 72 million zlotys per year. The characteristic feature of the park is its biological diversity. Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park is the only Polish natural property designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. The Park is the most important ‚Äì central zone of Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest Biosphere Reserve.  History  Vulnerable species, the European bison in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park The park's formal beginning was the Forest Reserve inspectorate () established in 1921. The inspectorate was transformed into the National Park in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa on 11 August 1932 by the Second Polish Republic. After World War II, the forest was divided between the People's Republic of Poland and the Belarusian SSR of the Soviet Union. The People's Republic of Poland reopened the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park in 1947. The park headquarters is in Bia≈Çowie≈ºa. Currently, the park consists of three administrative units: The Protective Or≈Ç√≥wka Precinct, the Conservation District Hwo≈∫na and the Bison Breeding Centre (with three reserves, breeding and demonstration Bison Reserve). Or≈Ç√≥wka The Or≈Ç√≥wka Protective Unit has an area of , of which 4784.46 ha is under strict protection, 235.48 ha under active protection and 53.27 ha under landscape protection. The area is subdivided into two protective districts: Sierchanowo (2303,24 ha) and Dziedzinka (2769.97 ha). Hwo≈∫na The Hwo≈∫na Protective Unit has an area of 5169.50 ha, of which 941.64 ha is under strict protection, 4203.68 ha is under active protection, and 24.18 ha is under landscape protection. The area is subdivided into four protective districts: Cupryki (area of 1243.17 ha), Gruszki (area of 1426,52 ha), Masiewo (area of 1120.29 ha) and Zamosze (area of 1379.52 ha). Bison Breeding Centre The European bison Breeding Centre has an area of 274.56 ha which is under the landscape protection. The area comprises three breeding reserves, and the European bison Public Access Reserve. The responsibilities of the personnel of European bison Breeding Centre cover the bison's habitat in all of the Polish part of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest. The idea of creating a national park locally is about 200 years old. However, the genuine protection efforts which are being continued today are centuries older.  Features  Often called the \\"last untouched wilderness of Europe\\", the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park is the only one of its kind among the 23 national parks of Poland. Its inner zone belongs to the realm of old-growth forest which has been living without much human intervention for almost 800 years. Only scientists can navigate the strictly protected area freely. Each group of tourists is limited to no more than 20 people, and the presence of an official guide is mandatory. A classic road tour leads through the southern part of the reserve area, totalling 4,747 hectares. Museum of Nature and Forest of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park The headquarters are located at the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa village in the Museum of Nature and Forest of the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park (pictured). The museum complex, built in the 1960s, occupies the place of the former palace of Polish King Augustus III, which was destroyed by the Soviet Army in July 1944. Above the roof of the museum, there is an observation tower available for tourists during the opening hours. The exhibition presents the local species of plants and animals shown through displays, but also through multimedia exhibits with the use of lighting and sound. Particularly commendable is the exhibit devoted to birds. Almost all living species in the region can be heard in audio recordings. Guides in foreign languages are available with additional fee. The waiting time for a group tour is no longer than 15 minutes. In almost every room of the museum, there are computers with information on the subject in different languages. However, the tour guides are also likely to repeat the same information for their listeners.

In the 1950s, Yellow Stores opened in Phoenix as a small store selling Army Surplus items. Jake Henegar bought the company from Jim Kelly in 1960. Henegar led the enterprise until his retirement in the early 1980s. In the 1960s Yellow Front Stores added more variety to their stock and increased their locations. By the 1970s they had stores all over the Southwestern United States. They were, by then, selling outdoor gear such as hunting, camping, and fishing supplies, as well as work clothing, such as Levi Strauss jeans. Presidents of Yellow Front Stores after Henegar's retirement were Sean Lee, Robert Bove, and David Stoup. After a quick expansion, Yellow Stores was forced to close all of their Pacific Northwest stores in 1977. Yellow Front Stores were acquired by Lucky Stores in 1978 for $45.9 million, but continued to operate as Yellow Front. Alternate Link via ProQuest. In 1987 there were 104 Yellow Front Stores in 8 states. Lucky sold the Yellow Front chain for $50 million during a hostile takeover by Asher B. Eshelman, a New York investor. The purchaser was a corporation owned by Kenmare; a private company owned by Daniel J. Sullivan. A few months later, Yellow Front purchased the Renton, Washington-based 64 unit Bonanza Stores. No records have been found if Yellow Front was able to convert these stores to the Yellow Front banner before it was forced into bankruptcy. Yellow Front Stores filed for bankruptcy in 1990 and eventually liquidated all of its stores.

He recently joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. He is best known for his discovery, on December 10, 2000, of Selam, also referred to as ‚ÄúLucy‚Äôs child‚Äù, the almost-complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million-year-old child of the species Australopithecus afarensis. The ‚Äúworld‚Äôs oldest child‚Äù, she is the most complete skeleton of a human ancestor discovered to date. Selam represents a milestone in our understanding of human and pre-human evolution and contributes significantly to our understanding of the biology and childhood of early species in the human lineage; a subject about which we have very little information. Alemseged discovered Selam while working with the Dikika Research Project (DRP), a multi-national research project, which he both initiated in 1999 and leads. The DRP has thus far made many important paleoanthropological discoveries and returns to the field each year to conduct further important research. Alemseged's specific research centers on the discovery and interpretation of hominin fossil remains and their environments, with emphasis on fieldwork designed to acquire new data on early hominin skeletal biology, environmental context, and behavior. Education and early career Zeresenay began his professional career as a geologist. After graduating with a B.Sc. in Geology from Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia in 1990, he began working as a Junior Geologist in the National Museum of Ethiopia's Paleoanthropology Laboratory. After obtaining a French language diploma in 1993, from the International Language School in Vichy, France, he began a M.Sc. program in the Institut des sciences de l'√©volution at the University of Montpellier II in France. He completed this program in 1994 and earned a Ph.D. in paleoanthropology through the Laboratory of Paleontology at Pierre and Marie Curie University and the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle, Paris in 1998. Zeresenay then moved back to Ethiopia, and it was the next year, 1999, while working as a research associate at the National Museum of Ethiopia and the French Center for Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that he formed the Dikika Research Project (DRP), the first Ethiopian-led paleoanthropological field research project, whose ongoing multi-national and multi-disciplinary mission is aimed at recovering data addressing Zeresenay's primary research interests: hominin evolution and the ways by which that evolution was influenced by the paleoenvironment. Zeresenay both leads the project and studies the recovered hominins and other primates. From 2000 to 2003 Zeresenay worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the Institute of Human Origins in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. It was at the beginning of his postdoctoral research that Zeresenay made his most significant discovery of ‚ÄúSelam‚Äù. Only one small piece of Selam's skeleton was found in 2000; it would take an additional six years for her to be fully extracted and analyzed before preliminary results were published in Nature in 2006. In 2004 Zeresenay moved back to Europe and became a senior researcher in the Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Zeresenay stayed with the Max Planck Institute until 2008, at which point he became the Curator and Irvine Chair of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, a position which he currently retains. Selam On December 10, 2000, the Dikika Research Project (DRP), led by Dr. Zeresenay, found the first piece of a major paleoanthropological discovery. The team, which was then composed of only Zeresenay and three Ethiopian assistants, found the skull of a fossilized child that year and over the course of five successive field seasons between 2000 and 2005, after an intensive process of screening and excavation, the team recovered the partial skeleton of Selam: the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor ever found. She is a member of the species Australopithecus afarensis, she was 3 years old when she died and she predated Lucy by 150,000 years. The discovery's significance lay not only in Selam's antiquity, but also in her age at death. Although relatively complete infant skeletons have been recovered for more recent human species, not a single juvenile skeleton has been found for any of the species in the preceding millions of years. Most of these early finds consist of nothing more than a skull, a piece of jaw or some isolated teeth. In contrast to these relatively sparse finds, not only was the DRP team able to recover Selam's complete skull, but also a sandstone impression of her brain and even the hyoid bone. Due to the fragility of the hyoid, such a discovery in a species of Selam's antiquity is almost completely unprecedented. The team was able to recover a significant portion of Selam's bones below the neck as well, including most of the spinal column, the ribs, both collar bones and both shoulder blades. These bones are almost completely absent in the fossil record, except for fragmentary pieces from Lucy. Both knee caps and large portions of the thigh and shin bones from each leg were recovered, as well as an almost complete foot. The bones show no indications of cuts or abrasions, nor do they show the type of damage associated with scavenging carnivores; this suggests that she was buried rapidly, perhaps by a flood, shortly after her death. It is also possible that it was this flood event which killed her. As the sediment pressed down on her through the years, Selam's bones became basically glued together in a highly compressed sandstone block. Usually paleoanthropologists struggle to reassemble fragmentary skeletal finds so as to place them back together, but Zeresenay faced the exact opposite situation with Selam. He worked painstakingly to extricate her impacted skeleton, using dental tools and removing the soil from her ribs and twisted spinal column virtually grain by grain. The process took 6 years before it announced in 2006 and is still ongoing. Selam's skull was CT scanned and it was this method that allowed her sex and age at death to be determined. Further analyses were able to establish the size of Selam's brain which, at approximately 330 cubic centimeters, would not have been very different from that of a 3-year-old chimpanzee. Whereas chimpanzees at this age have already formed over 90% of their brains, Selam had formed less than 90% of the adult brain size of her species when she died. This might point to a relatively slow brain growth in Australopithecus afarensis, similar to the brain growth pattern of modern humans, rather than that of chimps; this may point to a possible behavioral shift in Selam's species 3.5 million years ago and the emergence of the delayed pattern of brain development and maturity that we know of as human ‚Äúchildhood‚Äù. The post-cranial skeleton also yielded several important lines of data regarding the locomotion (movement) and height of Australopithecus afarensis. The femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and foot indicate that Selam (and hence the species she represents) walked fully upright, even at 3 years old, while the shoulder bones are more similar to those of gorillas. Selam's fingers, as well as those of other members of Australopithecus afarensis, are long and curved. This suggests that while the species was an effective biped while on the ground, it retained the ability to climb, which would have been a beneficial adaptation for avoiding predators, especially at night and especially for the smaller or younger members of the species. The rare presence of the hyoid bone also yielded some significant data pertaining to Selam's species. In this bone Selam is more similar to the African great apes than she is to modern humans. Along with a single Neanderthal example, Selam's hyoid is one of only two extinct hominin hyoids preserved in the fossil record and is the only example from a species of her antiquity. This bone is presumed to have played an important role in the development of human speech and its recovery gives us some clues towards understanding the nature and evolution of the human voicebox. This extraordinary ancient skeleton preserves a mosaic of features shared by both humans and the apes and clearly shows that both the anatomy and behavior of our ancestors was changing, slowly but progressively. In other words, evolution was in the making. Research projects The DRP Zeresenay's research interests lie in the discovery and analysis of new hominin and non-human primate fossils, with emphasis on the link between morphological changes over time and environmental transformations. To support these goals with new data, Zeresenay initiated the Dikika Research Project (DRP) in 1999. This multidisciplinary project undertakes field research on sediments spanning in age from about 4.0 million to less than 500,000 years ago and addresses some of the major questions in paleoanthropology. The Pliocene site of Dikika, in Ethiopia, from which the project derives its name, is uniquely suited to answering these questions due to its strategic chronological placement. Sediments from Dikika are older than the oldest sediments from Hadar and are therefore closer to the time interval in which there is some fragmentary evidence for the diverse nature of the human lineage. Asbole on the other hand, another site studied by the DRP, represents the Middle Pleistocene, a time period that is poorly understood in the region. http://research.calacademy.org/anthro/research/dikika Other professional activities The EAAPP Zeresenay is the Vice Chairperson of the East African Association of Paleontologists and Paleoanthropologists (the EAAPP), which he co-founded along with Chairperson Dr. Emma Mbua. The EAAPP was officially launched in Kenya on July 18, 2005, and is the first organization of its kind in this region. Members of the EAAPP meet biannually to report on their research findings and address issues such as policy regarding research requirements, collections management, and fieldwork ethics. Though the research area is limited to East Africa, the researchers are a diverse group made up of scientists and students from Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, Japan, Europe and the Americas. Much more information concerning the EAAPP, its organizing committee and mission statement can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20110722131843/http://www.eaapp.or.ke/AboutUs.html African research at the California Academy of Sciences The California Academy of Sciences (CAS) in San Francisco is one of the four largest institutions of its kind in the United States and is the oldest on the West Coast. Researchers at the Academy study the origins, evolution and diversity of species, their adaptations, systematics and phylogenetics. The Department of Anthropology joins departments of Ichthyology, Herpetology, Ornithology and Mammalogy, Aquatic Biology, Invertebrate Zoology and Geology, Entomology and Botany, as well as centers for Applied Biodiversity Informatics and Comparative Genomics, to study the biodiversity and evolution of living things through fundamental laboratory and field research. This collaborative environment, in which original research and public outreach are given primacy, is an ideal setting for Zeresenay's interests. Zeresenay and the DRP return to the Dikika field site every fall. The team's research during these field seasons has contributed significantly to the Academy's research on human origins and has added valuable data to the CAS Anthropological collection. In addition to Zeresenay's anthropological work in Africa, the Academy sponsors a number of different African projects led by researchers in varied disciplines. Dr. Robert C. Drewes, Curator of Herpetology, leads an annual expedition to the Gulf of Guinea Islands (Principe, Sao Tome and Annobon), to study the region's amphibian fauna. Dr. Frank Almeda, Chairman and Senior Curator of Botany, studies the vascular plants and lichens of the rainforests of southern Madagascar, and members of the Invertebrate Zoology and Geology Department have conducted field work in both Madagascar and South Africa. Additionally, in 2007, Dr. Galen Rathbun and Dr. Jack Dumbacher, of the Ornithology and Mammalogy Department, led a collecting expedition to the Namibian desert. This multidisciplinary approach to the biogeography of the region allows the California Academy of Sciences to study the full spectrum of Africa's natural history and its vital role as the birthplace of mankind.

Designed for personal use, the Sedan also found applications in utility roles including bush flying. The Sedan was the last design that Aeronca put into production and was the largest aircraft produced by the company. Design and development Like those of other Aeronca designs, the Sedan's fuselage and tail surfaces are constructed of welded metal tubing. The outer shape of the fuselage is created by a combination of wooden formers and longerons, covered with fabric. The cross-section of the metal fuselage truss is triangular, a design feature which can be traced back to the earliest Aeronca C-2 design of the late 1920s. In a significant design departure from previous Aeronca aircraft, the strut-braced wings of the Sedan are all-metal assemblies. Such combinations of construction types were not common. While the Sedan mated a fabric-covered fuselage to all-metal wings, the contemporary Cessna 170 mated an all-metal fuselage to fabric-covered wings. Also unique to the Sedan, among Aeronca designs, are the single-piece wing struts. The landing gear of the Sedan is in a conventional arrangement, with steel tube main gear, and a steerable tailwheel. Unlike its siblings the Champ and Chief, both of which employ oleo struts for shock absorption, the Sedan makes used of bungee cords to absorb landing and taxi loads. The Sedan is powered by the Continental C-145-2 or Continental O-300-A engine of ; the Franklin 6A4-165-B3 and Franklin 6A4-150-B3, of 165 and , respectively, are also approved for installation. The Sedan features an electrical system, including a starter, as standard equipment. As it had with many of its other models, Aeronca certified a seaplane version of the Sedan, the model S15AC. While the standard Sedan was equipped with a single entry door on the right side, the seaplane version offered a left-side door as well. Modifications Modernized Sedan with Lycoming O-360 engine More than 50 Supplemental Type Certificate modifications are available for the Sedan, many of these intended to modernize the aircraft. One, sold by the current owner of the Sedan design, replaces many of the components ahead of the firewall with updated versions, including a Lycoming O-360-A1A engine of , a constant speed propeller, a new engine mount, and a fiberglass cowling. A second modification from the design holder allows the removal of the oil cooler, which can break and for which there are no replacements available. Production history Entering production in 1948, the 15AC Sedan was Aeronca's four-seat addition to its pair of two-seat airplanes, the Champ and Chief, both of which had entered production in 1946. The four-place design gave Aeronca a lineup similar to that of its competitors. Many other companies with two-place designs had been adding four- place versions. Among these four-place competitors were the Cessna 170, PA-14 Family Cruiser, Stinson 108, Taylorcraft 15 and the Luscombe 11A Silvaire Sedan. The Aeronca Sedan was produced from 1948 until 1951, when Aeronca ceased all production of light aircraft. The Sedan production line shut down in 1950, but Sedans were still being assembled in 1951 from the remaining stock of parts. The last Sedan, which was also the last Aeronca-built airplane to fly, left the factory on October 23, 1951. Though Aeronca sold a number of its other designs after ceasing production, the company long maintained ownership of the Sedan. The HAOP-27 Krishak, built by Hindustan Aeronautics, shows some similarities to the Sedan. Some sources say that the Krishak was produced under license from Aeronca, though the differences are significant enough to call this into question. Aeronca finally parted with the design on 11 April 1991, selling it to (according to Federal Aviation Administration records) ‚ÄúWilliam Brad Mitchell or Sandra Mitchell‚Äù. On 10 July 2000, ownership of the design passed to Burl A. Rogers, owner of Burl's Aircraft of Chugiak, Alaska. Since 2000 Burl's Aircraft has provided parts and technical support to Sedan owners and operators. Burl's Aircraft production On February 21, 2008, Burl's Aircraft announced that the company was building new Sedan fuselages and a new style fuel valve. On December 8, 2009, Burl's Aircraft announced that they were commencing building new 15AC Sedans. Since Aeronca still exists, but no longer holds the type certificate, the new production aircraft will be marketed by Burl A. Rogers and Burl's Aircraft LLC as the Rogers 15AC Sedan. Operational history The Sedan was designed to be a docile airplane but also a good performer. Pilots found that the Sedan, with its large interior, had plenty of room for baggage and passengers. With its large wing, it had good takeoff performance, and was capable of short takeoff and landing operations. It found a niche as a personal aircraft and in commercial bush flying roles; it could also be equipped for agricultural work. Though the commercial roles have been largely taken over by more modern designs, many Sedans remain in use as personal airplanes. Their ongoing operation is aided by the availability of support from the design owner. Record flights A Sedan was chosen by pilots Bill Barris and Dick Riedel for their attempt to set a time aloft record in 1949. Their flight was sponsored by the local chamber of commerce and the Sunkist growers association, the second sponsor accounting for the naming of the aircraft as the Sunkist Lady. (The accompanying support aircraft, also a Sedan, was called the Lady‚Äôs Maid.) Departing from the Fullerton, California, Municipal Airport on March 15, the flight crossed the United States to Miami, Florida, where bad weather forced the pilots to circle for 14 days before making the return trip to Fullerton. Along the way, fuel and food were passed from vehicles on the ground to the pilots during low passes over airport runways. Having reached Fullerton on April 11, the pilots kept flying around the local area until April 26, finally landing at Fullerton Municipal Airport and setting a record of over 1,008 hours, or 42 days, in the air. The Fullerton record was short lived. Inspired by the flight at Fullerton, later in 1949, Yuma, Arizona, decided to sponsor its own time aloft record attempt. The city needed publicity as it was experiencing economic hard times due to the 1946 closure of Yuma Army Air Field. Pilots Woody Jongeward and Bob Woodhouse piloted the City of Yuma, a Sedan borrowed from local owners, modified for the flight and painted with the slogan, ‚ÄúThe City with a Future.‚Äù The flight began on August 24, with the aircraft remaining in the Yuma area throughout, and ended after more than 1,124 hours, or nearly 47 days in the air, on October 10. In 1997, the record-setting airplane was located and returned to Yuma; made airworthy again, it flew on October 10, 1999, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of the record flight. The \\"City of Yuma\\" airplane and the refueling car are now on display at City Hall in Yuma.

Geo. III, c. 127) is an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in 1797. Section 1 originally established that Parliament could be summoned fourteen days after the issuing of a proclamation recalling it to meet, notwithstanding any prorogation or law that would have stopped Parliament meeting earlier than this. This was amended by the Parliament (Elections and Meeting) Act 1943 and now refers to any day after the date of the proclamation. The rest of the Act has been repealed. Repealed sections Section 3 enacted that in case of the demise of the monarch after one parliament had been dissolved, but before the day indicated by the writ of summons for electing a new parliament, then the previous parliament (i.e. that which had been dissolved) was to be recalled immediately to Westminster. It would there sit as a parliament for the next six months, to all intents and purposes as though it had not been previously dissolved; it could, however, be dissolved or prorogued at any point during this time by the new monarch. A new writ would be issued, and the election would take place. (This replaced the less detailed Succession to the Crown Act 1707, s. 6.) Section 5 provided that if the monarch died after the date of the election, then the newly elected parliament would meet as normal. References *Costin, W. C. and Watson, Steven J. (ed.).

The club has had two seasons at the top level (Primera Divisi√≥n), in 1989/1990 and 1990/91. The 1989/90 season was the most successful in their history, as they finished 17th, and won the relegation playoff against Racing de C√≥rdoba 5‚Äì0 to retain their place in the Primera Divisi√≥n. The next season, the Primera was divided into two tournaments, the Apertura and Clausura.

About 50 growers in the district supply 1.6 million cases of apples, or 10% of the Australian apple crop, to the Australian market. The district also produces cherries and stone fruit. The town's main landmark, the \\"Big Apple\\", which stands on private land 5 km north of the town,Batlow: Big Apple, Big Trip. stands testament to the orchards which have been vital to the town's economy for over 120 years.  History  Before European settlement the Wiradjuri people lived in the Batlow area. Hamilton Hume and William Hovell were the first Europeans to explore the area in 1824, en route to Port Phillip. When gold was discovered in the area in 1854, a small settlement called Reedy Creek was established as a supply point and service centre for the mining area, and a Mr Batlow surveyed a townsite nearby. The gold deposits were quickly exhausted, but farmers found the area better suited to a variety of crops, so the mining supply point was moved and the current township established around 1855. Reedy Flat Post Office opened on 1 August 1873 and was renamed Batlow in 1889. Fruit trees and timber quickly became the main sources of income for the town, and in 1910 the townsite was gazetted. In 1922, the first cool stores in New South Wales were constructed in the town. At the same time a railway was built from nearby Tumut. These developments facilitated the town's trade with Sydney and beyond. The district supplied troops with dehydrated fruit and vegetables during World War II. Many Land Army Girls were stationed in and around Batlow during the Second World War and a sizeable collection of memorabilia is held at the Historical Society Museum. There are two Soldier Settlements close to Batlow, Willigobung and Kunama. On 4 January 2020 the town was damaged by fire during the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season. In the town itself at least 17 home were destroyed, as well as the old hospital and service station. Outlying properties were also affected with hundreds of apple trees \\"scorched\\".  Population  In the 2016 Census, there were 1,313 people in Batlow. 76.3% of people were born in Australia and 81.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.0%, Anglican 24.5% and Catholic 20.4%.  Climate and Geography  left thumb Batlow is located west of Canberra, though, by highway is approximately due to the Great Dividing Range between them. The nearest city is Wagga, whilst five towns and localities: Kunama and Laurel Hill in the southwest; Tumut in the northeast; Adelong in the northwest; and Tumbarumba in the south, are within . The countryside around Batlow is a plateau of rolling hills, straddling in altitude. Being on the western edge of the Great Dividing Range, Batlow receives much of the precipitation that has not fallen farther west, an average of per year; chiefly in winter, with August at . Little or no precipitation is received from the Tasman Sea to the east, due to the large distances and the Great Dividing Range; instead, precipitation derives from the Southern Ocean, advancing northwards across Victoria with south-westerly upwinds. The cold, often snowy winters, combined with the higher rainfall and good soils, make an excellent apple-growing climate. However, in 2006, Batlow experienced the most severe downturn in rainfall in New South Wales, receiving only of rain that year. Bago State Forest (surrounding plateau) Bago State Forest, about 16 km southwards of Batlow, yields a cooler climate owing to its much greater elevation. Snow is frequent from May to September, and often falls heavily; snowfall can be expected at any time of the year. The region is subject to high winds year-round. Climate data is sourced from Pilot Hill, which lies at 1,128 m AMSL‚Äî343 m higher than Green Hills State Forest. Present day Batlow Literary Institute Batlow is an agricultural town offering services and facilities to the surrounding area, including two primary schools and a high school, a library (with telecentre), a hall and several stores and small businesses. The Batlow Fruit Co-operative, trading since 1922, (now the Batlow Fruit Co.) is based in the town. Batlow was the home of the 'Mountain Maid' cannery until its closure in the early 2000s. The steel frame of the WWII Lend Leaseconstructed building used in the production of food for the allied troops is still visible today. Batlow's economy turns around the production of apples for the fresh food market. Some revenue is also obtained from other agricultural exploitations and timber from the large soft and hardwood plantations. There is a strong influx of seasonal labour for the harvesting of fruit from March to April. A smaller influx occurs at thinning time in December. There are a number of producers of cherries, nuts, honey and eucalyptus oil products. Batlow is now the home to a truffery, a number of published authors, including British media personality Joshua Fox and novice film makers. The Bago State Forest between Batlow and Tumbarumba contains stands of alpine ash and radiata pine. Pilot Hill Arboretum (est. 1920s) and the Sugar Pine Walk- a beautiful avenue of Sugarpine resembling a cathedral. On the third Saturday of May each year the Batlow Ciderfest is held in the main street showcasing locally and regionally produced cider and regional food. Many interesting stalls also attend the family friendly Ciderfest event. The Ciderfest recently came second in the NSW Event awards after only beginning three years ago. On the Friday preceding a Cider Industry Conference is held. In the past two years a 'Living Food conference' has also been added to the CiderFest weekend. On the third Saturday of October the Apple Blossom Festival is held. This re-invigorated festival began in 1942 and the First Apple Blossom Queen was a Land army girl. . Politics Batlow is in the Snowy Valleys Council. Batlow was moved to the bellwether federal Division of Eden-Monaro for the 2007 federal election. With Batlow usually voting overwhelmingly conservative, the vote swung to the centre left Australian Labor Party member Mike Kelly by 26%. Batlow is now in federal seat of Riverina.

It has the appearance of a miniature woman, the size of the first joint of the finger. The polong is one of the ghosts mentioned in Hikayat Abdullah, written by Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, much to the amusement of Sir Thomas Stamford Bingley Raffles, his employer. Hikayat Abdullah By Hamzah Hamdani, Abdullah (Munshi) Creation A polong is created from the blood of a murdered man kept in a type of spherical bottle with a narrow neck. Over a period of one to two weeks, incantations are said over the bottle. When the period is over, the blood becomes a polong. It refers to its owner as its mother or father. The polong is hidden outside the owner's house when not in use. Task The polong is sent to attack a victim against whom either the owner themselves or someone who paid the owner bears ill-will against. The polong is always preceded by its pet or plaything, the grasshopper-like pelesit. The pelesit enters the victim's mouth and begins to chirp. The polong follows and possesses the victim, causing them to go insane until exorcised. A polong victim froths at the mouth, tears at their own clothes, and attacks anyone nearby. As per some sources, people who have been attacked by polong are left with bruises, a few markings and almost always have blood coming out of their mouths.GOOD AND EVIL SPIRITS OF DEAD MORTALS Weaknesses Unless called off by its owner, a polong victim can only be cured through exorcism by a shaman (dukun or bomoh). The method of exorcism is to ask the polong who is its parent (meaning its owner). The polong replies through the possessed person in a falsetto voice, revealing the name and village of its owner. The polong will often resist, either by making the afflicted victim attack the shaman, or by falsely accusing someone else. In popular culture * In Marvel Anime: Blade, a Polong appears in episode 7. It is depicted as a vampire creature that obeys whoever gives it their blood.

It is the largest forest in County Durham and covers more than . Recreational activities are promoted within the forest and are focused at the eastern end, around the visitors centre. In addition to the visitors' centre, there is an adjacent cafe, an education room, toilet facilities, and an independent bike shop called Wood'n'Wheels, which also hires out bikes. History During the 1930s, the forest was planted and tracks were built by unemployed men supplied through the Ministry of Labour. Most came from the mining communities and shipyards of the North East of England. They were housed in one of a number of instructional centres created by the Ministry, most of them on Forestry Commission property. By 1938, the Ministry had 35 such centres across Britain. These were basically work camps, where unemployed men carried out heavy labour and lived on site in wooden huts. The centres were closed in 1938 as unemployment declined in the run-up to war, but some of the huts can still be seen around the visitors' centre, which was originally built as the camp's refectory. The visitors' centre was part of a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War. A number of Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age flint tools have been found in the forest in Doctor's Gate Quarry. An area of the forest is probably the site of a 15th century iron ore processing site. An area next to Linburn Hall Wood was the site of a medieval convent. An episode of Time Team in 2008 examined a large stone structure known as \\"the Castles\\", with walls five metres thick. It appears to date from the late Iron Age and may have been an animal enclosure.Time Team, Hamsterley at TV.com, accessed 2 December 2016 Mountain biking Mountain bike trails are developed in the forest by Hamsterley Trailblazers, which were constituted on 5 January 2004. There are three official routes: Blue (moderate), Red (Difficult), and Black (expert), all of which are waymarked with colour-coded marker posts. A previous Green (easy) route has since been removed. \\"The Loop\\" is a skills development circuit that includes features such as rock gardens and north shore obstacles. Features are graded from blue to black; therefore, helmets should be worn, and it is not suitable for occasional/family cyclists. A map showing areas used by mountain bikers Descend, a private club established in 2000, operates mountain bike 4X and downhill courses in the area south of the grove. See also Beyond Hamsterley for more mountain bike rides in the area. Other activities The forest is home to other activities, such as walking and horse riding. The forest has also been host to the RAC rally over many years as well as other rallies, including the Hamsterley Stages Rally, which has been known since 2009 as The Tour of Hamsterley Rally Durham Fell Runners are active in the forest, with regular events starting at the visitors' centre.

Burden Falls falls 20 feet (6 m) over a sandstone ledge, and the falling creek then descends another 80 feet (25 m) in a series of cascades and cataracts. Although this is a very small waterfall by the nationwide standards of the United States, Burden Falls is one of the highest waterfalls in Illinois. Unlike most of the state, Pope County and extreme southern Illinois escaped glaciation during the Ice Ages, and steep slopes display the effects of lengthy erosion. Similar geological features in other regions of Illinois were ground into oblivion by the ice. Watercourses confined by sandstone ledges, of the sort found in Burden Falls Wilderness, are locally known as shut-ins. Hardwood trees in the wilderness include blackjack oak, post oak, and white oak, the state tree of Illinois. Hikers use the Burden Falls Trail, a 3.5-mile (5.5 km) pathway.

He quickly found work at the International Art Service, a graphic arts studio with modernist European style founded by Arthur Wiener. The Enchanted Forest frontispiece Early career Maud and Miska met across the drawing board of the IAS studios, and married three years later in 1917. They moved to Greenwich Village in New York City. They obtained their first children's book work through Miska's Hungarian friend Willy Pogany, an established illustrator, and in a few years they had steady illustration commissions and were championed and encouraged by May Massee at Doubleday.Sharyl G. Smith, Maud and Miska Petersham: Their Work in American Children‚Äôs Book Publishing, 1920‚Äì1939, Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Columbia University, 1985, p. 27. By 1923, they were established and able to buy land and build a house in Woodstock, New York, on the edge of the thriving Byrdcliffe Arts and Crafts Colony. Among the books they illustrated during this period were A Child's Own Book of Verse (Books I and II), Carl Sandburg's Rootabaga Stories, Margery Clark's The Poppyseed Cakes and Johanna Spyri's Heidi. The first book they both wrote and illustrated was Miki, about their son, published in 1929. Maud later was to say, \\"At first we illustrated books written by others, but often we found no place in the text that lent itself to illustration, so we decided to plan a book of our own with both pictures and text.\\" Lee Bennett Hopkins, Books Are by People: Interviews With 104 Authors and Illustrators of Books for Young Children, Citation, 1969, pp. 209‚Äì20. The Petershams' work was recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA). Four of their books were selected for inclusion in the highly competitive AIGA exhibitions in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The titles so honored were Nursery Friends from France, Children of the Mountain Eagle, Tales Told in Holland and Get-A-Way and H√°ry J√°nos.The New York Times accounts of American Institute of Graphic Arts shows, December 5, 1926, and November 28, 1933. After the American Library Association established the annual Caldecott Medal for children's picture books in 1937, the Petershams were one of the runners-up for An American ABC in 1942 and they won the 1946 Medal. Today they may be known best as creators of that winning work, The Rooster Crows (Macmillan, 1945), a collection of American songs, rhymes, and games. The Petershams had two children, Miki, and Elizabeth Petersham.

Its sponsor company was South African and the team maintained a South African identity, but it was first registered in Italy and then, from 2007, in Great Britain. Barloworld rode UCI Continental Circuits races and, when selected, UCI ProTour events. They were managed by Claudio Corti, with Valerio Tebaldi, Christian Andersen and Alberto Volpi as directeurs sportifs. Its prominent riders included South African Robert Hunter and Colombian Mauricio Soler. Chris Froome rode for Barloworld for 2008 and 2009. The sponsor was Barloworld, an industrial brand management company. The team rode Bianchi frames with Shimano components.  Tour de France 2007  Barloworld competed in the 2007 Tour de France after a wild card entry. It was the first British-registered team in the Tour since ANC-Halfords in 1987. The team won two stages through Mauricio Soler and Robert Hunter, won the King of the Mountains competition (Soler), and had eight of its nine riders finish the race. Shortly after the Tour, team rider Ryan Cox, not a member of the Tour squad, died when an artery burst in his leg following surgery.  Tour de France 2008  The team again received a wildcard entry for the 2008 Tour de France, but Soler was injured on Stage 1 and dropped out in stage 5. Three others left with injuries, and only four completed the race, with no top three placings on any stage. Mois√©s Due√±as had a positive test for EPO following stage four and was withdrawn before stage 11. Barloworld announced their withdrawal from sponsorship after the tour, but on 28 October decided to sponsor for another year. The team was not invited to the 2009 Tour de France.

History From the Orthodox perspective, the Irish Church was Orthodox prior to the Great Schism of 1054.Orthodox Europe: http://orthodoxengland.org.uk/oeireland.htmhttp://orthodoxinfo.com/general/irishorthodoxchurch.aspxhttp://nftu.net/belief- ancient-irish-church-bloodless-sacrifice-real-presence/ Since the Gregorian Reforms did not immediately reach Ireland until the beginning of the twelfth century with the four great reforming synods of Cashel I (1101), R√°th Breasail (1111), Kells-Mellifont (1152), and Cashel II (1172), Ireland's progress away from her ancient communion with the rest of the Christian East was extremely slow and likely not felt in many isolated Christian communities until some time after the arrival of the Normans. Therefore, the great golden age of Irish saints and scholars is seen by the Orthodox as being Ireland's era of her true Christian Orthodoxy, as it was only after Ireland accepted the papal reforms that this golden period of intense asceticism ceased, and Catholic orders of monasticism were introduced from the Continent. In recognition of this, Orthodox Patriarchates have begun to emphasize pre-schism Irish saints in their worship, and even building churches dedicated to them.https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-orthodox-church-st-patrick-western- saints/28366219.htmlhttp://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/102222.htm Modernity The Russian Orthodox tradition was brought to Ireland in the 1920s by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, which has formally re-joined the Moscow Patriarchate in the 2000s. Greek and Romanian Orthodox churches were first established in Dublin in 1981 and 2000 respectively. All three jurisdictions serve mostly eastern European and Greek immigrants, along with a number of Irish-born converts. Due largely to immigration from Eastern Europe, especially Romania, the number of Orthodox Christians in the Republic of Ireland has doubled in recent years.http://journeytoorthodoxy.com/2013/07/10/number-of-orthodox-christians- in-ireland-doubles-in-five-years/  Russian Orthodox Church in Ireland  Russian Orthodoxy came to Ireland in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. White Russian refugees arrived in small numbers and settled throughout the country. The Russian Orthodox Divine Liturgy was held in various locations around the Dublin quays by visiting priests from England. In the mid-1960s, Nicholas Couris, an elderly Russian aristocrat and former officer in the Imperial Russian Army and the anti-communist White Army, was ordained a priest in the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia. He served a growing congregation of Russian White emigres, Greek immigrants, and Irish-born converts from a Dublin house chapel until his death in May 1977.https://web.archive.org/web/20030728112349/http://www.orthodoxireland.com/history/frnicholascouris/view In the early 1990s, work began on Ireland's first Orthodox church to be built since the Schism. The church, situated in Stradbally, Co. Laois, is dedicated to the local monastic St. Colman of Oughaval. In 1993, Divine Liturgy was served there for the first time by Bishop Mark of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. After the unification of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Orthodox Church Outside of Russia took place in 2007, priests from the Patriarchate of Moscow began holding regular church services in St. Colman‚Äôs church. In May 2017, a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia was assigned to the Parish of St Colman's in Stradbally where weekly services are now held. The late 1990s saw an influx of people to Ireland from eastern Europe. The Russian Orthodox Church began its activities in Ireland in 1999 with monthly liturgies at the Greek Church on Arbour Hill in Dublin. In 2001, it moved to a former Anglican church at Harold's Cross. Renamed the parish of Saint Peter and Paul, it was dedicated under the authority of the Moscow Patriarchate. Father Michael Gogoleff, a Russian-French priest, serves as its dean, and Father Brian Garrigan, who succeeded Father George Zavershinsky, is the resident priest, occupying the same position between 2002 and 2009. The church community has around 1,500 members, including emigres from the various republics of the former USSR, faithful from Poland and Rusyns from Eastern Slovakia. There is also a significant membership of Orthodox Irish, mostly converts. The services are mainly conducted in Church Slavonic, but a considerable amount of English is also used along with smatterings of Greek, Georgian, Romanian, Serbian and the Irish language. The Russian School of Music was established by the church in Harold's Cross.Russian School of Music In September 2009, the Bishop Elisey of Sourozh paid a visit to the Irish parishes of his diocese. In October 2010, the Russian Orthodox Church of Ireland opened two more congregations: in Athlone in Connaught province and Drogheda in Leinster province. It also offers monthly liturgies for members in Waterford, Cork and Galway.  Greek Orthodox Church in Ireland  In 1981, the Greek Orthodox parish of Our Lady of the Annunciation was established in the former St Mary's Church, Dublin 1, which had been given over by the Church of Ireland. On 24 May of that year, the Greek Orthodox archbishop of Great Britain and Ireland consecrated and elevated the building to the status of a cathedral. When these premises were declared unsafe in 1986, the parish transferred to a house chapel in Artane. In November of that same year, the Church of Ireland transferred another of its defunct churches, in Ranelagh, for Greek Orthodox use. The parish is currently served by Father Thomas Carroll.  Romanian Orthodox Church in Ireland  Romanian Orthodox Church, Western Way, BroadstoneThe Romanian Irish Orthodox Church appointed its first priest in October 2000. Starting in January 2001, Sunday worship has taken place in Belvedere College Chapel in the centre of Dublin, courtesy of the Jesuit Fathers. In June 2005, the Church of Ireland made Christ Church Leeson Park in Dublin 4 available for the use of the Romanian Orthodox community. The Church celebrates The Exaltation of Holy Cross. It serves around 1,500 people in the Dublin area, around 120 of whom worship in two new parishes. Fr. Godfrey O'Donnell, who helped establish the church service in Dublin in 2001, became the first Irish-born priest ordained into the Romanian Church in 2004. From 2010, the Romanian Orthodox parish of Ballsbridge had been operating from two alternate locations in Blanchardstown: three recently appointed priests hold the liturgy there every Sunday. The parish has a full calendar of weekday activities, with an evening mass on Wednesdays and Fridays, and special masses are held for each of the celebrations of the Romanian Orthodox calendar. On 9 April 2006, a fourth priest in Ireland was ordained with responsibility for two new parishes in Cork and Galway (where services are conducted in the Anglican St. Nicholas' Collegiate Church). In 2010 Fr Ioan Irineu Craciun relocated to the Romanian Community after 29 years ministering to Greek Orthodox in Arbour Hill. In 2017, the Romanian Orthodox Church moved from Blanchardstown when it opened its new church, The Church of the Annunciation, on Western Way, Broadstone, Dublin D07 FA38.Romanian Orthodoxy Finds a New Home on Western Way by C√≥nal Thomas, Dublin Inquirer, May 31, 2017. There are also occasional Romanian Orthodox liturgies in Tipperary, Tralee, Killorglin and Navan.  Other Orthodox Churches  In addition, the Antiochian Orthodox Church has parishes in Ireland and their number continues to grow (Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of the British Isles and Ireland). Divine Liturgy is served every second Sunday in the Month at the Church of the Holy Rosary Chapel Street Castlebar by the clergy. While growth in the number of members was due to converts from other denominations, in recent years a number of refugees from Syria have increased its membership.Protestants are the Majority of Converts to Irelands Antiochian Orthodox by Chai Brady, Irish Catholic, October 5, 2017 The Serbian Orthodox Church has one missionary parish in Dublin, under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Britain and Scandinavia.Diocese of Britain and Scandinavia: Ireland The Georgian Apostolic Orthodox Church in Ireland serves mostly emigrants from Georgia; since May 2012, services have been conducted in the Catholic Carmelite community church in Avila in Dublin.Georgian Orthodox Church - Official Website See also * Christianity in Ireland References  External links  * Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain (and Ireland) * The Fascinating Life of Father Nicholas Couris * The Dedication of Saint Peter and Paul's Russian Orthodox Church in Dublin * The History of the Orthodox Church in Ireland until 1987 *The Parish of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in Stradbally, County Laois * The Website of SS.

In municipal solid waste and waste reclamation processing it is the process of extracting and converting materials from recycled materials derived from the previous step until all subsequent levels of output are extracted or used. Levels of Recurive Recycling Level 1 Recursive Solid waste or municipal solid waste can be treated, sanitized and separated under steam in a pressure vessel (waste autoclave). Following the processing under steam and removal of toxic materials via condensate filtering, usable recyclables are immediately extracted for reuse (plastics, ferrous metals, aluminum, glass, wood, etc.). Level 2 Recursive Organic materials from the original waste stream are converted to a fiber using steam at 60 psi and 160 ¬∞C. The converted organics (sanitary fiber) is size reduced by 85% and can be used to produce bio-fuels using acidic-hydrolysis or enzymatic-hydrolysis as ethanol or may be used as refuse derived fuel. Level 3 Recursive After the monosacrides are extracted for distillation, the remaining residue (used fiber) can be used as a feed stock for electricity production. Level 4 Recursive Finally, the non-toxic ash from the combusted fiber can be collected and used as a filler for preparation in super concrete and then reused in combination with similar materials (gravel, stones, pottery, glass) to form aggregate for construction materials. In true recursive recycling and conservation processing the ability to divert all materials in the waste stream from landfill at greater than 99 percent is a concept based on outputs used to provide the next level of processing, reuse, conservation and market delivery of the derivatives. Analyst commentary The concept of recursive recycling has been proved up in small scale facilities (thermal hydrolysis, plasma, etc.) but has not been widely accepted because of the financial impact it may have on existing protocols in waste management. One pilot facility operated commercially in Wales for approximately six years. However, the core equipment was moved to another location while the original facility was scheduled for retrofit. No further information about the facility's capacity or the equipment movement has been made available via open source release. Since that pilot commercial facility stopped operating, the concept of recursive recycling has not met with as much success as originally anticipated by environmentalists and conservationists. There are a number of companies operating autoclaves with limited success across the globe (the autoclave operating in Anaheim California was de-commissioned in c. late 2007-early 2008) but the full concept of waste treatment using thermal hydrolysis technology has not been fully realized because of several misconceptions in the autoclave and related steam treatment technologies. There is available engineering background to demonstrate successful testing that can be validated in physical production facilities but because of a lack of participation and general knowledge is a closely held secret, the application of technologies to achieve full recursive levels has not been accepted. A number of companies are working on technology to support this concept. That may bring about change to conservation and recycling when associated advances prove out as successful. However, given the current state related areas of technology the growth to full-scale production appears to be limited because the technology and demonstrating it is available in larger capacities has not been demonstrated commercially.

The Institute has held annual week-long conferences at Star Island in New Hampshire since 1954. The conference attracts about 250 members and non-members each year. The 1964 conference, for example, was attended by 215 conferees, with speeches by figures including Theodosius Dobzhansky.\\"Religious Institute at Star Island\\", The Portsmouth Herald, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 29 July 1964, p. 18. Mission In its Constitution, the IRAS purpose is stated as follows: \\"The Institute on Religion in an Age of Science is established * to promote creative efforts leading to the formulation, in the light of contemporary knowledge, of effective doctrines and practice for human welfare; * to formulate dynamic and positive relationships between the concepts developed by science and the goals and hopes of humanity expressed through religion; and * to state human values in such universal and valid terms that they be understood by all peoples, whatever their cultural background or experience, in such a way as to provide a basis for world-wide cooperation. The IRAS Council adopted the following statement in 2003: ‚ÄúWe at IRAS take the natural world seriously as a primary source of meaning. Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry. ‚ÄúFrom here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For others, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude. ‚ÄúWe acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.‚Äù History IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge. The first president was Edwin Prince Booth, a professor of church history at Boston College (1954‚Äì59). Subsequent presidents included Harlow Shapley, Philip Hefner, Ursula Goodenough, and Varadaraja V. Raman. In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.

Defence Nuclear Material Transport Operations are also known as DNM Transportation; Defence Nuclear Material in transit; Nuclear movements; and DNM movements. The Special Escort Group of the Ministry of Defence Police, SEG (MDP), escort the nuclear materials and remain on standby during their transit. Immediate Response Forces (IRF) are embedded within the road and rail transports, and on standby with air transports. Defence Nuclear Materials are moved using the following transport means: *Trident nuclear weapons, special nuclear material (SNM) and new submarine reactor fuel are transported by road. *Used reactor fuel from Royal Navy submarines is transported by rail (and may involve a short road journey to the railhead). *SNM is also moved by air, as are US nuclear weapons.Local Authority & Emergency Service Information (LAESI), 4th Edition, December 2004 http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/509681FE-9E5C-4C99-8502-5505C5DFD7AA/0/laesi_v4_dec04.pdf Nuclear weapon transport by road Trident NWs are contained within PD AWG 516 packages.

The Mark I TCHDs were AEC Mammoth Majors. The Mark II TCHD carriers were 7-axle articulated lorries, the four-axle tractors for which were built by Foden.Issue 117 Out and about with the Special Escort Group, Talk Through, The Magazine of the MoD Police, March/April 2004. p16-23 http://www.nukewatch.org.uk/seg.php These vehicles have cargo bodies designed to provide extra protection to the nuclear weapon containers. The Mark III vehicle introduced in 2011, which replaced the Foden towing a similar three-axle trailer, is a similarly capable four-axle tractor based on a highly modified Mercedes-Benz Actros, which has its three- pointed star Mercedes-Benz logo removed.http://www.nukewatch.org.uk/ The primary logistical movement of nuclear weapons is from the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) in Berkshire, England, to the Royal Naval Armaments Depot RNAD Coulport in Argyll, Scotland (part of HMNB Clyde). Because the warheads need to be constantly refurbished, batches are shuttled by road convoy several times a year.DS&C-NAR; Report 'NRC Booklet Exercise Senator 2005' Convoys use Staging Posts (SP) and Crew Change Locations (CCL) during this journey. The TCHDs containing the weapons are escorted in a convoy of MoD vehicles commanded by a Ministry of Defence (MDP) Chief Inspector. A crew (of up to 50 people) include a first aid team, fire crew and personnel equipped to monitor for radiological hazards. The convoy maintains contact by radio and telephone with Task Control, MDP Central Information Room, Wethersfield, Essex, which monitors its movement, and with the civil police force through whose area it is passing. Police forces are notified at least 24 hours in advance of a convoy being routed through their area; this enables them to advise the convoy about any local traffic problems. Police forces may advise fire brigades of the presence of the convoy if it is moving into the vicinity of a fire brigade operation. Three organisations are involved in the convoy, namely Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines, AWE civilian personnel and the Special Escort Group. Convoy vehicles include:- *The Stand Off Escort ‚Äì Royal Marines provide armed military personnel to counter any potential threat and the SEG‚Äôs role is the close escort (security) and traffic management throughout any convoy move. *The Escort Commander's vehicle leads the convoy, navigating the routes and managing the timings by constantly being kept informed of traffic situations up ahead. *The TCHDs, or Truck Cargo Heavy Duty vehicles which carry the nuclear weapons. There are up to five in a convoy. Each AWE driver is accompanied by an armed SEG officer as close escort. *Fire Tender, with staff employed by AWE ‚Äì the Convoy Safety Officer & Fire Crew *Convoy Commander‚Äôs Vehicle, manned by MDP Chief Inspector and his team. *The Traffic Car with two SEG police officers keep traffic behind by putting on a 'rolling block' whenever there is a traffic build up ahead or the convoy approaches hazards such as roundabouts or junctions. *Two miles behind the main part of the Convoy there is a Support Element that includes a Convoy Support vehicle, a recovery vehicle and a coach. The AWE provides a Deputy Convoy Safety Officer who is responsible for this element. Many details on NW convoys are kept secret by the Government and MoD who operate a Neither Confirm Nor Deny (NCND) policy on informing the public regarding NW convoys. Evidence given by the Nuclear Information Campaign to the Defence Select Committee (based on figures from campaign group Nukewatch UK for 2000 to 2006) give the number of convoys as ranging from two to six return journeys per year from Aldermaston to Coulport. Estimates of the warhead numbers transported during this period are that 88 were moved from Aldermaston to Coulport while 120 were returned, indicating a withdrawal of between 30 and 50 warheads leaving an operational stockpile of between 150 and 170 warheads.House of Commons Defence Committee.

In the event of a nuclear accident the SSC would activate the MoD‚Äôs Nuclear Accident Response Organisation (NARO) and would alert the local police constabulary immediately. The responsibility for these operations rests with the Director Nuclear Movements & Nuclear Accident Response Group (D NM&NARG;). All mission critical support vehicles involved in the NW transport operation are owned by D NM&NARG.; The vehicles were purchased by the MOD for use in their then current role from the Royal Air Force (RAF) Nuclear Weapon Convoy Group and transferred to D NM&NARG; en bloc in 2002. Prior to 2002 the RAF were in commanding roles during NW convoys. NW Convoys regularly attract protesters who try to stop the convoy and climb onto the TCHDs. The MDP are trained on a regular basis to counter any protest. MDP motorcyclists and traffic car officers make arrests and then hand over responsibility to the local Police Force. For 22 years AWPC (Aldermaston Women‚Äôs Peace Campaign) have held a monthly camp outside the fence at AWE Aldermaston. Nukewatch UK tracks convoys and has provided evidence for the House of Commons Defence Select Committee (evidence from Nuclear Information Service) Special nuclear material (SNM) transport by road SNM is transported in the UK both by road and by air overseas. When transported by road SNM is moved in High Security Vehicles (HSV) escorted in a convoy of MoD vehicles commanded by an MDP Inspector. The convoy is made up of a crew of up to 30 which includes personnel in case of accident and the monitoring of radiological hazards. The MDP started working with the SNM convoys in 1978, and their purpose was to escort the MOD‚Äôs Special Nuclear Materials around the United Kingdom. Most of this work being to, and from, the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston.Issue 118 Out and about with the SNM, Talk Through, The Magazine of the MoD Police, June/July 2004, p18-21 http://www.nukewatch.org.uk/snm.php New reactor fuel transport by road Reactor fuel for nuclear-powered submarines is manufactured at Rolls-Royce in Derby. It is transported by road to Devonport Dockyard for installation into submarines undergoing refit. In addition new reactor cores are transported to BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness for installation into new build submarines and very infrequently to the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE) at Dounreay, in the North of Scotland. New fuel is transported in the form of separate modular units that are individually packaged into protective containers known as New Module Containers (NMC). The NMCs are loaded onto standard road transport vehicles that travel in convoy. These movements are escorted by the Ministry of Defence Police Special Escort Group (MDP SEG) and specialists travelling in separate vehicles provide technical support in key areas such as radiation monitoring. The convoy crew consists of over 20 personnel. The civil police are given at least 24 hours notice prior to the move and are contacted by the convoy commander when the convoy enters and leaves their respective areas of responsibility. The Fire Services would be informed by local agreement. Nuclear weapon and SNM transport by air UK nuclear weapons are moved by road, but movements of US nuclear weapons are conducted by air. The RAF maintains response teams at a number of bases along the flight route which are brought to immediate readiness during the transit of the aircraft through their area. The Special Safety Cell (SSC) at Ensleigh in Bath is staffed throughout the flight. Only multi-engined military transport aircraft are used to transport nuclear or SNM weapons by air, and after careful route selection. Aircraft selected for the task are subject to special safety checks and an enhanced maintenance regime. SNM material is flown to the US under agreements. In a letter to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the MoD said they \\"can confirm that the Ministry of Defence does transport special nuclear material by air to the United States under the provisions of the 1958 UK/US Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes.\\"Letter to CND member from Mrs S Ryan, Directorate of Nuclear Policy, Ministry of Defence, 24 November 1997. http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/brize.html Some non-nuclear states to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) maintain that this movement of SNM breaks Article I of the NPT.Disarmament Diplomacy. Issue No. 76, March/April 2004. US-UK Nuclear Weapons Cooperation Up for Renewal. http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd76/76news04.htm Used reactor fuel transport by rail Used reactor fuel is transported by rail from Devonport (and occasionally Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment, Dounreay) to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) at Sellafield. The used fuel is transported in protective purpose built transport containers designed in accordance with IAEA standards and loaded onto special wagons which may be configured for rail or road use. The train will carry one or two containers with each loaded onto a separate wagon. The MoD is responsible for the consignment of used reactor fuel. All used fuel movements are escorted by the MDP SEG, who travel in a further two rail vehicles arranged at either end of the container transporter. Additional staff familiar with the load and capable of providing technical support during the journey, travel with the MDP SEG. The SEG communicate their position to the MDP at Wethersfield, and local police are informed in advance. The Fire Service would be informed by local agreement with the civil police. Used reactor fuel transport by road Used reactor fuel is transported by rail, and may involve a short road journey to the railhead. Security and safety measures are equivalent to those provided during road transport of new fuel. The used fuel consignment is transported in protective purpose-built transport containers designed in accordance with IAEA standards, and is loaded onto special wagons configured for rail as well as road use. Accident and terrorism risks Transport containers for nuclear weapons, SNM and new and used reactor fuel, provide protection from impact, mechanical stress and fire. They are tested against International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards for abnormal environments. In the event of an incident, control passes to Ministry of Defence Nuclear Accident Response Organisation (NARO). Defence Nuclear Material Transport Contingency Arrangements are in place in case of accidents involving DNMs. In a report from the Nuclear Movements and Nuclear Accident Response Group an extreme accident could result in a nuclear explosion. A serious vehicle collision or an aircraft crash combined with multiple failures of the MoD's secret protective measures could mean that the weapon might not remain single-point safe. The report puts the overall yearly risk of an \\"inadvertent yield\\" in the UK at 2.4 in a billion, mainly due to the possibility of an aircraft crashing onto a nuclear weapons road convoy. Inadvertent yield suggests a partial nuclear explosion, also called fizzle yield, smaller than the full yield of up to 100 kilotons.If a nuclear convoy should crash‚Ä¶ New Scientist, 12 November 2005, Rob Edwards, Magazine issue 2525 https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg18825253.000-if-a-nuclear- convoy-should-crash.html However, the most significant health risk to members of public arises from the potential for a release of plutonium oxide aerosol from the fissile pit of a warhead, a high probability event if the warhead(s) was subject to intense fire sufficient to initiate detonation of the conventional high explosive compression packs that surrounds the nuclear heart of the warhead.Transportation of Nuclear Weapons through Urban Areas in the United Kingdom, C1 Abstract & Summary, November 1990 - Reissued March 2008. http://www.largeassociates.com/1875%20Nuclear%20Weapon%20Transportation/RL1875-Ch1%20Abst- Summary.pdf A potential risk of moving nuclear weapons is terrorist attack. In May 2005 the MoD's Director of Information, David Wray, refused a Freedom of Information request about convoy axle weights (it was alleged that the convoy had used a weak bridge) from an anti-nuclear activist on the grounds that it may help terrorists to plan an attack. \\"Such an attack has the potential to lead to damage or destruction of a nuclear weapon,\\" he wrote. \\"The consequences of such an incident are likely to be considerable loss of life and severe disruption both to the British people's way of life and to the UK's ability to function effectively as a sovereign state.\\" References Category:Military of the United Kingdom ","title":"Defence Nuclear Material Transport Operations"},{"id":"7099232","text":"Damien Pottinger (born January 17, 1982) is a Canadian former professional soccer player who played the majority of his career in the United Soccer Leagues and the Major Indoor Soccer League.

It is a compilation of tracks from his five previous studio albums, released between 1980 and 1989, plus three new compositions. Yanni was encouraged to release the album by his then partner, actress Linda Evans. Reflections of Passion became Yanni's fastest selling and most successful album of his career upon release. It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top New Age Albums chart and No. 29 on the Billboard 200. Yanni supported the album with a nationwide concert tour in 1991 that featured his band and an orchestra. In 1995, it was certified double platinum for selling 2 million copies in the US. Background Actress Linda Evans convinced Yanni to release the album In August 1989, Yanni released his fifth studio album, Niki Nana. The album marked his stylistic development from solo keyboard music towards rock with the addition of additional vocalists, musicians, and choir. Around the same time of its release, Yanni's newfound relationship with American actress Linda Evans, who had become a fan of his music, received press attention. Not long into their relationship, Evans pitched an idea she had for an album from Yanni which was long in duration, reflected a single mood throughout, and something that she could play at dinner parties. She mentioned this as the pair sat by a lake in Evans's estate in Tacoma, Washington, while listening to Yanni's music on a cassette. Yanni then made a tape of Evans's favourite songs of his, which were the compositions more mellow in style, to avoid her having to switch between albums. He said that the tracks she picked were \\"not the best of Yanni, but the lighter side\\". Evans recalled: \\"Then my sister wanted it. Then my friends wanted it. Then my sister broke hers and wanted to borrow mine and then wrecked mine trying to tape hers\\". The tape Yanni produced for Evans became the basis of Reflections of Passion. It is formed of fifteen tracks, twelve of which are from his first five studio albums, from Optimystique (1980) to Niki Nana (1989). Three tracks on the album, \\"Almost a Whisper\\", \\"True Nature\\", and \\"Flight of Fantasy\\", are new compositions. In the liner notes, Yanni wrote: \\"This album represents my life's passions during the past ten years. It is an expression of love for the people in my life, as well as for some very special and inspiring places I can never forget.\\" On May 31, 1990, Evans organised an album release party at The Beverly Hills Hotel. They anticipated for 300 people to attend, but 700 turned out for the event. Release Reflections of Passion was released on May 15, 1990. It entered the Billboard 200 at No. 188 for the week of August 4, 1990. It re-entered the chart in late 1990 before it reached its new peak of No. 29 in January 1991. On the Billboard New Age Albums chart, the album debuted at No. 8 for the week of June 16, 1990. It climbed the chart for the next three weeks to reach No. 1 for the week of July 28. It remained at the top of the chart for 23 consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by In the Wake of the Wind by David Arkenstone, in June 1991. Private Music organised a nine-month marketing campaign for the album, which gained further commercial momentum towards the end of 1990 following nationwide media exposure of Yanni's relationship with Evans. This included a front cover and featured article in People, an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show that included Yanni performing three songs live, and Into the Night with Rick Dees. During Thanksgiving week, sales rose from under 200,000 to over 400,000. Sales of Yanni's back catalogue also increased during this time. In April 1991, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 500,000 certified copies in the US. This figure doubled in the following six months, reaching platinum in October 1991. In September 1995, the album was certified 2√ó platinum for selling two million copies. \\"Swept Away\\" was released as a single on March 1, 1991. Reception In a review by Johnny Loftus of AllMusic, \\"The album that launched a thousand wind machines, Reflections of Passion established Yanni as the face of contemporary instrumental music. While 15 of its songs were culled from earlier releases, it was nevertheless the pianist and composer's popular breakthrough. It propelled him onto the world stage -- literally, since he performed concerts in such locales as the Taj Mahal and China's Forbidden City. The exotic places fit Yanni's sweeping compositions, which incorporated crashing percussion and fleets of surging synthesizers to approximate what a wind storm would sound like if it was made of melody. \\"Nostalgia\\", \\"True Nature\\" and \\"Farewell\\" all worked on simplistic, yet extremely powerful piano lines that ebbed and flowed with new age grace. Sure, things could get a bit too soft-focus; tracks like \\"First Touch\\" were like delicate menageries teetering on a high shelf. But Yanni's command of straightforward structure and melody helped mainstream Reflections immensely.\\" Tour In April 1991, Yanni began his first major concert tour across the US that featured a 10-piece band, including a string quartet, performing in 31 cities in six weeks. All the music was performed live without the use of computers or pre- recorded parts. The band included: *Charlie Adams - drums *Osama Afifi - bass guitar *Charlie Bisharat - violin *Michael Bruno - percussion *Joyce Imbesi - keyboards *Bradley Joseph - keyboards *Amy Shiotani - keyboards Track listing All music composed by Yanni.

It operated from 1878 through 1978, after the final owner, Continental Business Enterprises closed it due to lack of attendance. After the park's closure, its rides and structures were left largely untouched and unmaintained for over 35 years. History Andrew's Pleasure Grounds: 1875‚Äì1898 In 1875, Edward Andrews organized a picnic ground and beach under the name Andrew's Pleasure Grounds. The park operated with some success, but its condition deteriorated. With the addition of a steam boat and the park's first rollercoaster, the amusement park was brought to life. The initial roller coaster had to be manually pushed up the track following each ride. Chippewa Lake Park: 1898‚Äì1969 Mac Beach acquired Chippewa Lake in 1898 and improved the park immensely. He also placed a ban on liquor sales. Mac's son, Parker Beach, managed the park during its boom years: The Roaring '20s. During that decade, the first modern coaster was built at the park, designed by Fred Pearce. Originally named the Big Dipper, it became better known as simply 'the coaster'. The park also featured a live band-stand seven nights a week. The park opened the wooden roller coaster in 1925. The coaster was a fairly small roller coaster, estimated to be about 50 Feet high. The coaster operated until the park closed in 1978. The coaster stood abandoned for over 30 years until it was demolished in 2010. The Beach family kept the park running successfully into the 1960s. Eventually, Chippewa Lake would feature three roller coasters, flying cages, a Ferris wheel, carousel, Tumble Bug, ballroom, and many other rides. Chippewa Lake Park at Illicit Ohio. Resale and closure: 1969‚Äì1978 Chippewa Lake was acquired by Continental Business Enterprises in 1969, and the company developed plans to transform the park into more of a summer resort; these plans, however, drew very little public interest and funding and most of the plans were scrapped. The park would later close in 1978 - which was the park's centennial season - under the company's ownership, owing to factors like competition from nearby Cedar Point and the now defunct Geauga Lake amusement parks, as well as the decline of steel and rubber production in the surrounding areas. It was largely unknown to the public that the park's 100th season would be its last; the park closed rather secretly without any big media coverage or massive public outcry. When the park shut down, former owner Parker Beach made a request to his family that he be buried there when he died, to which his family agreed. The site where Beach's body is buried in the park is unknown. In the 2007 documentary, \\"Welcome Back Riders\\", at the very end, it said Be respectful if you try to find Parker Beach's Grave. Let him enjoy his park in peace. ...It's by the roller coaster. Abandonment and deterioration: 1978‚Äì2008 The Park's Ferris wheel in 2007, left standing like many rides, but overgrown with foliage After the park's closure in 1978, the land the park was situated on was left largely untouched and all of the rides and buildings were left standing, in which up until the end of the 1990s the park remained in fairly good condition and some of the rides were still usable. By the 2000s, however, large trees began growing through rides like the coaster and the park's ferris wheel, and several buildings had collapsed or been damaged by the effects of the elements. All of the structures in the park became rusted and rotted without any hopes of repairs. List of Rides and Attractions: * Coaster * Ferris Wheel * Miniature Railroad * Carousel * Fun House * Tumble Bug * Dodgem * Little Dipper * Himalaya * Flying Cages * Caterpillar * Flying Scooters * Octopus * Tilt A Whirl * Rocket Ship * Wild Mouse About 4:00 PM on Thursday, June 13, 2002, the Chippewa Lake Park Ballroom burned down. By 2008, several other buildings had suffered the ballroom's fate, including the hotel, arcade, fun house, peanut stand, and maintenance building, all of which had been damaged or destroyed by fire. However, other rides and structures still stood, in various states of disrepair. These included the coaster, the Wild Mouse, the Little Dipper, the Tumble Bug, and the frames of the Ferris Wheels and Flying Cages. Most other buildings across the park were in various states of collapse due to 30 years of neglect by this time. In 2008, thirty years after the park's closure, the land the amusement park stood on was offered up for sale with an asking price of $3.5 million, and, according to the realtor's website, was sold. The page which indicated this was last updated on March 26, 2008. CB Richard Ellis - Chippewa Lake Park The 2007 documentary film \\"Welcome Back Riders\\" featured Chippewa Lake Park.

New Orleans, Louisiana, was the largest city in the South, providing military supplies and thousands of troops for the Confederate States Army. Its location near the mouth of the Mississippi made it a prime target for the Union, both for controlling the huge waterway and crippling the Confederacy‚Äôs vital cotton exports. In April 1862, the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Captain David Farragut shelled the two substantial forts guarding each of the river-banks, and forced a gap in the defensive boom placed between them. After running the last of the Confederate batteries, they took the surrender of the forts, and soon afterwards the city itself, without further action. The new military governor, Major General Benjamin Butler, proved effective in enforcing civic order, though his methods aroused protest everywhere. One citizen was hanged for tearing down the US flag, and any woman insulting a Federal soldier would be treated as a prostitute. Looting by troops was also rife, though apparently not with Butler‚Äôs approval. He was eventually replaced by Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, who somewhat improved relations between troops and citizens, but military occupation had to continue well after the war. The prompt surrender of the city had saved it from serious damage, so it remains notably well-preserved today. Map depicting Louisiana and approaches to New Orleans as depicted during the Civil War.ORN I, v. 18, p. 131. Approaches to New Orleans, Department of the Gulf Map Number 5, February 14, 1863.Official atlas: plate XC. Early war years The early history of New Orleans was one of uninterrupted growth. In the 1850 census, New Orleans ranked as the 6th largest city in the United States, with a population reported as 168,675.1860 United States Census It was the only city in the South with over 100,000 people. By 1840 New Orleans had the largest slave market in the nation, which contributed greatly to its wealth. During the antebellum years, two-thirds of the more than one million slaves who moved from the Upper South in forced migration to the Deep South were taken in the slave trade. Estimates are that the slaves generated an ancillary economy valued at 13.5 percent of the price per person, generating tens of billions of dollars through the years.Walter Johnson, Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market, pp.2 and 6 Antebellum New Orleans was the commercial heart of the Deep South, with cotton comprising fully half of the estimated $156,000,000 (in 1857 dollars) exports, followed by tobacco and sugar. Over half of all the cotton grown in the U.S. passed through the port of New Orleans (1.4 million bales), fully three times more than at the second-leading port of Mobile. The city also boasted a number of Federal buildings, including the New Orleans Mint, a branch of the United States Mint, and the U.S. Custom House.Harper's Weekly, February 16, 1861 Louisiana voted to secede from the Union on January 22, 1861. On January 29, the Secession Convention reconvened in New Orleans (it had earlier met in Baton Rouge) and passed an ordinance that allowed Federal employees to remain in their posts, but as employees of the state of Louisiana. In March, Louisiana ratified the Constitution of the Confederate States. The New Orleans Mint was seized; it was used during 1861 to produce Confederate coinage, particularly half-dollars. Since the dies were not changed, these are indistinguishable from 1861-O (the raised O indicating New Orleans) halves minted by the U.S. government. (Using a different reverse die, an unknown number of true Confederate half-dollars were minted, before the silver bullion ran out. See New Orleans Mint.) New Orleans soon became a major source of troops, armament, and supplies to the Confederate States Army. Among the early responders to the call for troops was the \\"Washington Artillery,\\" a pre-war militia artillery company that later formed the nucleus of a battalion in the Army of Northern Virginia. In January 1862, men from the free black community of New Orleans formed a regiment of Confederate soldiers called the Louisiana Native Guard. Although they were denied battle participation, the Confederates used the Guard to defend various entrenchments around New Orleans. Several area residents soon rose to prominence in the Confederate States Army, including P.G.T. Beauregard, Braxton Bragg, Albert G. Blanchard, and Harry T. Hays, the commander of the famed Louisiana Tigers infantry brigade which included a large contingent of Irish American New Orleanians. The city was initially the site of a Confederate States Navy ordnance depot. New Orleans shipfitters produced some innovative warships, including the CSS Manassas (an early ironclad), as well as two submarines (the Bayou St. John submarine and the Pioneer) which did not see action before the fall of the city. The Confederate Navy actively defended the lower reaches of the Mississippi River, during the Battle of the Head of Passes. Early in the Civil War, New Orleans became a prime target for the Union Army and Navy. The U.S. War Department planned a major attack to seize control of the city and its vital port, to choke off a major source of income and supplies for the fledgling Confederacy. Fall of New Orleans The political and commercial importance of New Orleans, as well as its strategic position, marked it out as the objective of a Union expedition soon after the opening of the Civil War. Captain David Farragut was selected by the Union government for the command of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in January 1862. The four heavy ships of his squadron (none of them armored) were, with many difficulties, brought to the Gulf Coast and the Lower Mississippi River. Around them assembled nineteen smaller vessels (mostly gunboats) and a flotilla of twenty mortar boats under Commander David Dixon Porter. The main defenses of the Mississippi River consisted of two permanent forts, Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, along with numerous small auxiliary fortifications. The two forts were of masonry and brick construction, armed with heavy rifled guns as well as smoothbores and located on either river bank to command long stretches of the river and the surrounding flats. In addition, the Confederates had some improvised ironclads and gunboats, large and small, but these were outnumbered and outgunned by the Union Navy fleet. On April 16, after elaborate reconnaissance, the Union's fleet steamed into position below the forts and prepared for the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. On April 18, the mortar boats opened fire. Their shells fell with great accuracy, and although one of the boats was sunk by counter-fire and two more were disabled, Fort Jackson was seriously damaged. However, the defenses were by no means crippled, even after a second bombardment on April 19. A formidable obstacle to the advance of the Union main fleet was a boom between the forts, designed to detain vessels under close fire if they attempted to run past. Gunboats were repeatedly sent at night to endeavor to destroy the barrier, but they had little success. US Navy bombardment of the forts continued, disabling only a few Confederate guns. The gunners of Fort Jackson were under cover and limited in their ability to respond. At last, on the night of April 23, the gunboats Pinola and Itasca ran in and opened a gap in the boom. At 2:00 a.m. on April 24, the fleet weighed anchor, Farragut in the corvette Hartford leading. After a severe conflict at close quarters with the forts and ironclads and fire rafts of the defense, almost all the Union fleet (except the mortar boats) forced its way past. The ships soon steamed upriver past the Chalmette batteries, the final significant Confederate defensive works protecting New Orleans from a sea-based attack. At noon on April 25, Farragut anchored in front of the prized city. Forts Jackson and St. Philip, isolated and continuously bombarded by the mortar boats, surrendered on April 28. Soon afterwards, the infantry portion of the combined arms expedition marched into New Orleans and occupied the city without further resistance, resulting in the capture of New Orleans. New Orleans had been captured without a battle in the city itself and so it was spared the destruction suffered by many other cities of the American South. It retains a historical flavor, with a wealth of 19th-century structures far beyond the early colonial city boundaries of the French Quarter. The city was in Confederate hands for 455 days. New Orleans under Union Army The Federal commander, Major General Benjamin Butler, soon subjected New Orleans to a rigorous martial law so tactlessly administered as greatly to intensify the hostility of South and North. Many of his acts gave great offense, such as the seizure of $800,000 that had been deposited in the office of the Dutch consul. Butler was nicknamed \\"The Beast,\\" or \\"Spoons Butler\\" (the latter arising from silverware looted from local homes by some Union troops, though there was no evidence that Butler himself was personally involved in such thievery). Butler ordered the inscription \\"The Union Must and Shall Be Preserved\\" to be carved into the base of the celebrated equestrian statue of General Andrew Jackson, the hero of the Battle of New Orleans, in Jackson Square. Most notorious to city residents was Butler's General Order No. 28 of May 15, issued after some provocation: if any woman should insult or show contempt for any Federal officer or soldier, she shall be regarded and shall be held liable to be treated as a \\"woman of the town plying her avocation,\\" a common prostitute. That order provoked storms of protests both in the North and the South as well as abroad, particularly in England and France. Among Butler's other controversial acts was the June hanging of William Mumford, a pro-Confederacy man who had torn down the US flag over the New Orleans Mint, against Union orders. He also imprisoned a large number of uncooperative citizens. However, Butler's administration had benefits to the city, which was kept both orderly and his massive cleanup efforts made it unusually healthy by 19th century standards. However, the international furor over Butler's acts helped fuel his removal from command of the Department of the Gulf on December 17, 1862. Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks later assumed command at New Orleans. Under Banks, relationships between the troops and citizens improved, but the scars left by Butler's regime lingered for decades. Federal troops continued to occupy the city well after the war through the early part of Reconstruction. Civil War heritage A number of significant structures and buildings associated with the Civil War still stand in New Orleans, and vestiges of the city's defenses are evident downriver, as well as upriver at Camp Parapet. On Camp Street, Louisiana's Civil War Museum at Confederate Memorial Hall Museum, founded in 1891 by war veterans, boasts the second-largest collection of Confederate military artifacts in the country, after Richmond's Museum of the Confederacy.

In most of the versions collected from oral sources, the song opens up giving a date for the events that it describes (usually between 1823 and 1853). However, the song is actually older than this and a form of it was published as a ballad before 1725.R. Vaughan Williams & A.L. Lloyd (editors): The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs, Penguin Books, 1959. p.115 It has been given a Roud number of 347. The song tells of a whaling expedition that leaves for Greenland. The lookout spots a \\"whalefish\\", and harpoon boats are launched. However, the whale strikes the boat with its tail, capsizing it, and several men are killed. The captain grieves over losing his men, but especially for having lost his prey. He then orders the ship to sail for home, calling Greenland a \\"dreadful place.\\" Like most traditional songs, \\"Greenland Whale Fisheries\\" exists in different versions.e.g. Vaughan Williams & Lloyd p.50. Version collected by Anne G. Gilchrist from the singing of W. Bolton, Southport, Lancashire, 1906 Some change details (such as the date of the expedition), and others add or remove verses. Some modern versions, including the ones recorded by Theodore Bikel, The Chad Mitchell Trio, and later by The Pogues, flip the captain's expression of grief to make him regret losing his catch even more than losing his crew. In the version popularized by The Weavers and Peter, Paul and Mary, a shanty recorded by Alan Lomax from a Bahamian fishermanhttps://www.allmusic.com/album/bahamas-1935-chanteys-anthems-from- andros-cat-mw0000602802 is appended, which begins, \\"When the whale gets strike, and the line run down, and the whale makes a flounder with her tail...\\"Check-list of Recorded Songs in the English Language in the Archive of Folk Song, United States Work Projects Administration.

A shell-damaged carriage and the remains of a brick chimney are in the foreground, 1865 Ruins from the fire of 1861, seen from the Circular Church in Charleston, 1865 Charleston, 1865 Charleston, South Carolina, was a hotbed of secession at the start of the American Civil War and an important Atlantic Ocean port city for the fledgling Confederate States of America. The first shots against the Federal government were those fired there by cadets of the Citadel to stop a ship from resupplying the Federally held Fort Sumter. Three months later, the bombardment of Fort Sumter triggered a massive call for Federal troops to put down the rebellion. Although the city and its surrounding fortifications were repeatedly targeted by the Union Army and Navy, Charleston did not fall to Federal forces until the last months of the war. Early war years Charleston ranked as the 22nd largest city in the United States according to the 1860 Census, with a population of 40,522. As the 1814 burning of Washington had shown, America's coastal cities were vulnerable to a hostile fleet. Along the Atlantic seaboard the young Republic began building a series of substantial forts. Fort Sumter is the most famous of these sited on a shoal in Charleston harbor. There were also a series of smaller and older forts and bastions to protect it from any enemy ships. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina convoked a special convention in Charleston to debate her long dissatisfaction with the Federal government and many Northern citizens' views on slavery. They believed that the avowed views of the new President-elect made abolition a likely goal of his administration. On December 20, 1860, the Secession Convention voted for South Carolina to secede from the Union. As the first state to do so, they also issued a Declaration of the Immediate Causes which explained her decision to part company from her erstwhile sister states. Beginning with the Missouri Compromise in 1820, the defense of slavery, more than tariffs or states' rights, was the main factor contributing to sectionalism in South Carolina.Cauthen (1950) p. 1 The Secession Convention declared: White southerners feared revolts by enslaved people. In 1860, half of South Carolina's population were enslaved black people. Following its Secession from the Union in December, South Carolina militia seized Castle Pinckney and the Charleston Arsenal and their supplies of arms and ammunition. On January 9, 1861, Citadel cadets fired upon the merchant ship Star of the West as it was entering Charleston's harbor. Local pride makes some call these the first shots of the Civil War. The ship had been sent by the Buchanan administration with relief supplies of men and mat√©rial for Fort Sumter's small garrison. As the new Confederate States of America came into being late that winter, old and abandoned forts were revamped around Charleston to focus upon the massive, though not completed, Federal fort. Just as Lincoln was being inaugurated, the new President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, appointed General Beauregard of Louisiana to take command of the virtual siege of the island fort. Informed by the new Lincoln government that a supply ship, with food but no men or munitions, was to restock the fortress, President Davis, after consulting with his cabinet, on April 9 ordered the fort to be reduced before it was resupplied. On April 12, at 3:20 AM, after a final effort to have the Union garrison surrender, Col. Robert Chestnut, CSA, notified Major Robert Anderson, USA that in one hour the batteries commanded by Brigadier General Pierre G. T. Beauregard would open fire. Anderson, who had been a professor of Artillery at West Point, aware of the consequences of this, was deeply moved by the declaration. As would happen many times again over the next four years, the embattled leaders knew each other well. Beauregard, back at West Point, had been Anderson's assistant. After a 34-hour bombardment, Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort. Throughout much of the war, cadets from the Citadel, South Carolina's military institute, continued to aid the Confederate Army by helping to drill recruits, manufacture ammunition, protect arms depots, and guard Union prisoners. On December 11 of 1861, a massive fire burned 164 acres of the city, destroying the Cathedral of Saint John and Saint Finbar, the Circular Congregational Church and South Carolina Institute hall, and nearly 600 other buildings. Much of the damage remained un-repaired until the end of the war.http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110130/PC1602/301309938 In June 1862, a small but important battle at Secessionville, modern-day James Island, South Carolina, resulted in Union forces being repulsed by a much smaller Confederate force. The victory provided the city with a propaganda coup and saved it from the threat of land invasion. Not until the latter stage of the war would the city be under such threat again. Later war years View of Post Office (Now \\"Old Exchange Building\\"), East Bay Street, Charleston, 1865, showing the last palmetto left in the city after the bombardment As many Southern port cities had been closed off by the Union blockade, Charleston became an important center for blockade running. Repeated attempts by the Union Navy to take Charleston and/or batter its defenses into the ground proved fruitless, including the Stone Fleet. The city resisted military occupation for the majority of the war's four years. In 1863, the Union began an offensive campaign against the defenses of Charleston Harbor, beginning with a combined sea-land engagement. The naval bombardment accomplished little however, and the land forces were never put ashore. By summer of 1863, the Union turned its attention to Battery Wagner on Morris Island, which guarded the harbor entrance from the southwest. In the First and Second battles of Fort Wagner, Union forces suffered heavy losses in a failed attempt to capture the fort. A siege however resulted in Confederate abandonment of Fort Wagner by September of that year. An attempt to recapture Fort Sumter by a naval raiding party also failed badly, but Ft. Sumter was gradually reduced to rubble via bombardment from shore batteries, after the capture of Morris Island. With the development of newer, longer-range artillery, and as Union forces were able to place batteries even closer to the city, the city was subjected to increasing bombardment. In November 1863, Jefferson Davis visited the city and noted it was better the city be reduced to \\"a heap of ruins\\" than surrender. The bombardment that began in late 1863 continued on and off for 587 days and destroyed much of the city that had survived the fire. A coordinated series of attacks on the city were launched in early July 1864, including an amphibious assault on Fort Johnson and an invasion of Johns Island. These attacks failed, but they continued to wear down the city's defenders. The defenders were finally beaten back and the Union was able to capture the city, only a month and a half before the war ended. Charleston Harbor was also the site of the first successful submarine attack in history on February 17, 1864, when the H.L. Hunley made a daring night attack on the USS Housatonic.U.S. Navy history website Although the Hunley survived the attack, she foundered and sank while returning from her mission, thus ending the threat to the Union blockade. As Gen. Sherman marched through South Carolina, the situation for Charleston became ever more precarious. On February 15, 1865, Gen. Beauregard ordered the evacuation of remaining Confederate forces. On February 18, the mayor surrendered the city to General Alexander Schimmelfennig; and Union troops finally moved in, taking control of key sites. The first soldiers to enter the city were members of the 21st Infantry Regiment of the US Colored Troops and the 55th Massachusetts Infantry, another Black regiment.

Early life and career Sievers was born in Berlin, Germany. His father was Professor Johannes Sievers, an art and architectural historian with the German Foreign Office until his dismissal by the government in 1933, and author of the first four volumes of a monograph on the neo-classical architect Karl Schinkel. His mother was Herma Schiffer, a writer and educator of Jewish background who was Director of the Institute for Educational Films. From 1936 to 1938, he studied at the Contempora Lehrateliers f√ºr neue Werkkunst in Berlin, a progressive private art school created by architect Fritz August Breuhaus de Groot, which, like the famous Bauhaus, strongly emphasized the unity of all applied arts. Sievers took architectural photographs for his father's books on Berlin's historical buildings, particularly the work of Karl Schinkel. He also spent a year working in Portugal from 1935 to 1936. In 1938, he was retained as a teacher at the Contempora, but decided to emigrate to Australia following rumours of the school's imminent closure by the authorities. He had arranged for his photographic equipment to be transported, but was briefly questioned by the Gestapo, then conscripted as an aerial photographer for the Luftwaffe. He fled the country immediately, going first to England in June. In Australia, Sievers opened a studio in South Yarra, Melbourne. After war was declared, he volunteered for the Australian Army and served from 1942 to 1946. Following demobilisation, he established a studio at Grosvenor Chambers in fashionable Collins Street, initially drawing many of his commissions from fellow European immigrants including the architect Frederick Romberg, and Ernst Fuchs who had arrived from Vienna. During his early years in Melbourne, Sievers became a lifelong friend of fellow √©migr√© photographer Helmut Newton and his Australian actress wife June Browne, who later made photographs herself under the pseudonym \\"Alice Springs\\". Work Significant corporate clients included Alcoa, Australian Paper Manufacturers, Comalco, Hamersley Iron, John Holland Group, John Lysaght, Shell and Vickers Ruwolt. He also received commissions from architectural firms including Bates, Smart and McCutcheon, Hassall & McConnell, Leith & Bartlett, Winston Hall and Yuncken Freeman. In the 1950s, Sievers was engaged by the then Department of Overseas Trade with a brief to change Australia's image from a land of sheep and wool to an image of a sophisticated industrial and manufacturing nation. Many of these images were published in the magazine Walkabout. Sievers' work after the war was imbued with the Bauhaus ethos and philosophy of the New Objectivity he had learned in Berlin, combined with a socialist belief in the inherent dignity of labour. His photographs were often overtly theatrical, as he commonly photographed industrial machinery at night, isolating details with artificial light and posing workers for heightened effect. This can be seen in 'Gears for Mining Industry' (1967), perhaps his most well known single image. Despite the contrived nature of many of these images,Andrew Stephens, \\"Witness to a lost time\\", The Age, 7 June 2014, Spectrum, p. 26. Retrieved 27 November 2015 this approach was extraordinarily influential in Australian post-war commercial photography. In 1989, the Australian National Gallery staged a retrospective of his work, an exhibition which travelled around the country, often accompanied by Sievers' lectures. In 2000, he was the subject of a major retrospective exhibition held in Lisbon, Portugal at the \\"Arquivo Fotografico Municipal de Lisboa\\". For his services to photography, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2002. The National Library of Australia has an archive of more than 50,000 of Sievers' negatives and transparencies. Sievers was active in Australia, Germany and Austria with research into the emigration of war criminals to Australia from 1990 to 1998. In 2007, he donated several hundred photographs from his archive, worth up to A$1 million, to raise money for justice and civil liberties causes. Wolfgang Sievers died at the age of 93, a month short of his 94th birthday.

When she came out of the river, she found a poisonous snake in her pot. She took it home, so it would bite her and end her misery. When she opened the pot, she found a rich necklace. She sold it to the king. The king put it in a chest, but when he opened it to show the queen, he found a baby boy. He and the queen raised it as their son, and the old woman was the nurse. She spoke a little of how that boy came about. The king had concluded with a neighboring king that his son should marry that king's daughter, and when the daughter came to marry, her mother warned her to ask about the magic. She refused to speak until he told her. He told her the story, that he was prince from far off who had been turned into a snake, and then he became a snake again. The princess mourned for the prince where he had vanished, and the snake came to her. He told that if she put bowls of milk and sugar in the four corners of the room, snakes would come, led by the Queen of the Snakes. If she stood in the queen's way, she could ask for her husband, but if she were frightened and did not, she could not have him back. The princess did as he said, and won back her husband.

History On 3 August 2001, the Real IRA, a dissident Irish republican organisation and splinter of the Provisional IRA, detonated a car bomb containing of homemade plastic explosives in Ealing Broadway, West London, England. The bomb was in a grey Saab 9000 near the train station, restaurants and pubs on Uxbridge Road, which exploded shortly after midnight, injuring seven people. Debris caused by the bomb spread more than . The bomb was timed to target leaving karaoke pub-goers‚Äîbut whilst most escaped injury, the explosion still caused significant damage to property, estimated to be around ¬£200,000. The adjacent Ealing Broadway shopping centre was also damaged by flooding arising from the water main under the car bomb being ruptured. Experts regarded the bomb to be designed to look spectacular on CCTV for the purposes of 'armed propaganda' rather than to cause large numbers of injuries. However, anti-terrorist detectives claimed that the attack was planned to be a massacre and to cause as much carnage as the Omagh bombing three years prior. The bombing was the last successful Irish republican bombing on British soil outside Northern Ireland, of whom dissidents have waged an armed campaign since the Belfast peace agreement was signed in 1998, ending the Troubles. Aftermath and conviction The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams and others. It also came during a crucial time for the Northern Ireland peace process with disagreements regarding the Provisional IRA's decommissioning process. The attack came months after the Real IRA bombed the BBC Television Centre 3 miles away‚Äîa local MP claimed that west London residents felt \\"cold fury\\". Two days prior to the attack, a 20 kg Real IRA bomb was discovered at Belfast International Airport. After Ealing, the bombers targeted a new attack on Birmingham on 3 November, but which ultimately failed. In November 2001, three men‚ÄîNoel Maguire, Robert Hulme and his brother Aiden Hulme‚Äîwere arrested in connection with the Ealing, BBC and Birmingham bomb attacks. They were all later convicted at the Old Bailey on 8 April 2003. Robert and Aiden Hulme were each jailed for 20 years. Noel Maguire, whom the judge said played \\"a major part in the bombing conspiracy\\", was sentenced to 22 years. Two other men, James McCormack, of County Louth, and John Hannan, of Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh, had already admitted the charge at an earlier hearing. McCormack, who played the most serious part of the five, the judge said, was jailed for twenty-two years. John Hannan, who was seventeen at the time of the incidents, was given sixteen years' detention.

In field hockey, each player carries a stick and cannot take part in the game without it. The stick for an adult is usually in the range 89‚Äì95 cm (35‚Äì38 in) long. A maximum length of 105 cm (41\\") was stipulated from 2016. The maximum permitted weight is 737 grams.Rules of Hockey 2015-2016 The majority of players use a stick in the range 19 oz to 22 oz (538 g - 623 g). Traditionally hockey sticks were made of hickory, ash or mulberry wood with the head of the sticks being hand carved and therefore required skilled craftsmen to produce. Sticks made of wood continue to be made but the higher grade sticks are now manufactured from composite materials which were first permitted after 1992. These sticks usually contain a combination of fibreglass, aramid fiber and carbon fibre in varying proportions according to the characteristics (flexibility; stiffness; resistance to impact and abrasion) required. Early rules Parts of hockey stick. After centuries of different variations of field hockey (including a version in England, sometime prior to 1860, in which, because of the very hilly heathland area in which it was played, a rubber cube and not a ball was used), the game became more organised and regularised. By 1886, when an association of clubs was formed and the game became more standardised, the modern game as we know it began (and a white painted cricket ball had become the standard object to play with). The game had also by this time divided into various branches which developed as separate sports. Shinty, a game popular in Scotland, uses both sides of a round stick with a curved end, which is shaped in a similar way to a walking stick; the Irish game, hurling, uses both sides of a stick which is flat on both sides and shaped somewhat like bill-hook with an axe-like handle. Bandy also uses both sides of the stick. It was called \\"hockey on ice\\" in the beginning, as it was considered an ice variety of hockey. The stick in England, possibly because of the close association with it of cricket players, developed with a stick with just one flat playing side, the left face, below a round grip area‚Äîwith the use of the right-face side, which is rounded, prohibited‚Äîan oddity that had a profound effect on the later development of the hockey stick and of the game itself. There have been only three parts of a hockey stick ever named in the rules: the head, the handle, and the splice. Originally (until 2004) the handle was the part above the bottom end of the splice and the head was the part below the bottom end of the splice. Other terms in common use are \\"grip\\", which refers to the part of the stick held, particularly that area held with two hands when hitting the ball. Most sticks have a round grip which is covered in a non-slip, sweat absorbent, fabric tape. The handle remains rounded on the reverse, back or right hand- side but becomes gradually flat on the \\"face\\" side and also becomes wider, changing from a diameter of approximately 30 mm to a flat width of approximately 46 mm (the permitted maximum was 2 in‚Äînow 51 mm). This flat area above the curve of the head is generally referred to as the \\"shaft\\". The head of the stick is generally thought of as the curved part. The right side is called the face, the upturn the \\"toe\\" and the bend of the head where it joins the shaft the \\"heel\\". In recent times using the edges of the stick (as well as the face side) to strike at the ball has been permitted and thus \\"forehand edge stroke\\" and \\"reverse edge stroke\\" will be found in rule terminology. Forehand and reverse stroke refers to the taking of these strokes, from the right or left hand side of the body respectively, as the stick may be used \\"face up\\" or \\"face down\\" to make an edge stroke, the two edges of the stick are not separately named but simply referred to as edges. Initially there were six rule requirements applying to the hockey stick: * The stick had to be flat on the playing side (the left side when the toe of the stick head is facing away from the user). * It had to be able to be passed completely through a two-inch (internal diameter) ring. * The stick was to be smooth (no rough or sharp edges). * The head of the stick was to be a) curved and b) made from wood. * A maximum and minimum weight were specified, 28 oz and 12 oz respectively. During the 19th century, field hockey evolved in England. This evolution led to the creation of the Federation Internationale de Hockey (FIH) in 1924. Contance Applebee is responsible for introducing field hockey to the United States in 1901. The United States Field Hockey Association was formed in 1922. In 1908, men's field hockey was introduced into the Olympic Games. Women's field hockey was first recognized in the Olympic Games in 1980. The World Cup is the crowning achievement in international field hockey. The World Cup is held every four years and 12 men's and 12 women's teams compete for the title of World Champion. Head length Reversed head in various positions against a stick held forehand. Hockey stick head overlays The extreme in short heads The first major developments to what was later termed the \\"English style\\" stick (and the method of play with such sticks) occurred in India. (The game in its modern form was apparently brought to India by the British Army, although there does not appear to be any specific evidence of this. But certainly hockey was played by the British forces in India.) At that time the stick head was very long (in excess of 12\\"‚Äî300 mm) and made from an indigenous British timber, ash. The Indians then produced sticks with a much shorter head length and a tighter heel bend and used mulberry, which is tougher than ash, but has similar bending characteristics and weight and is easy to work. This development changed the nature of the game, led to the \\"Indian dribble\\" and to Indian dominance of the game in the first half of the twentieth century. A hockey stick is occasionally used in the vertical position shown, but manipulating the movement and the direction of the ball in a controlled way (dribbling) is carried out in what is termed a \\"dribbling crouch\\", when the handle of the stick will usually be angled between 35¬∞ and 55¬∞. Hitting or pushing the ball can be done with the stick at any angle between the vertical and horizontal and recent changes to the rules allow even the edges of the stick to be used to sweep or strike at the ball on the ground. The various stick head designs can be compared in respect of how, with the handle at an angle of 45¬∞, they differ in the carrying out of the Indian dribble, i.e. controlling the direction of the ball by rotating the stick head over the top/front of the ball rather than (or as well as) around the back of the ball (the English style dribble). The multi-layered stick head diagram indicates the changes in head shape and length that occurred over thirty years or so. The earliest trend was in shortening the stick head. While that reduced the stopping area of the head it was beneficial because, according to the rules at the time, only one side of the stick head could be used (at that time the ball could not be played with the edges of the head or handle but with the flat side or face side only). Using extreme examples is useful as a means of demonstrating effects that occur in less extreme configurations but are much more difficult to spot and therefore to explain. The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned \\"Reversed head in various‚Ä¶\\"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ball‚Äîa vertical adjustment is necessary. Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a horizontal adjustment is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling position‚Äîthis in turn impairs the ability to scan the pitch and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same time‚Äîa considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents. So, although the long head stick was an adequate shape for a dribbling style which was based on moving the ball forward from directly behind the ball; and changes of direction could be achieved by rotating the stick around the back of the ball and/or moving the feet to either side of the ball, it was not so easy to use the long stick head to bring the ball across the feet and back again, particularly when it was placed wide to the left of the feet of the player. (This left side position was compounded in difficulty with a very severe interpretation of \\"obstruction\\", which prohibited shielding of the ball from an opponent. The game was also, at the time, seen as \\"right-sided\\" and positioning the body between the ball and a close or closing opponent, approaching from the right hand side, was not allowed.) Reversed stick hitting, pushing and flicking would be short range skills and difficult to do accurately, if at all, especially when moving at speed. Gradually over many years stick heads were made shorter and the \\"heel\\" was made to a tighter bend. This process continued until the \\"one piece\\" head could not be made to a sharper bend without the timber splitting out on the base. As it was, attempts to have the grain follow entirely the same curve as the bend, as it should for maximum strength (this is why the timber is bent rather than cut to shape) were abandoned by some producers and an upturn to the toe was sometimes achieved by cutting across the wood-grain at the toe end of the head to achieve the desired shape. Some manufacturers resorted to gluing a separate piece of wood on top of the toe or glued additional strips of timber to the inner edge of the handle above the head to get the effect of a tighter heel bend. (\\"Head adjustment\\" frequently happened to update old style stock or where unmodified presses were in use.). Some players were cutting part of the toe off their sticks, to achieve a shorter head, and rounding the end off, (although on the older styles this did nothing to tighten the bend to the heel and often just ruined the stick). Predictably, there were sticks produced for the 1986 World Cup with heads with a horizontal length of only 95 mm. The international players to whom they were handed out tried them and then returned them as unusable. The difficulty was twofold: 1) The toe was so short that it could not be rotated completely over the top circumference of the ball and 2) When the stick head was played around the back of the ball it \\"ran off\\", because there was insufficient \\"run length\\" to the stick head. If, for example, a player \\"propped\\" the ball while moving in a dribbling crouch (putting the stick head over the front of the ball), drew the ball back towards his feet and then took the stick head around the back of the ball to bring it forward again, perhaps moving the ball off in another direction (a common movement), the margin for error was so small that the ball could easily slip off the stick head. The ultra-short stick head was to some extent based on the idea that the new artificial surfaces would lead to a style of hockey based on stopping the ball with the handle of the stick near horizontal to the ground and that dribbling to elude opponents would be almost eliminated with near continuous passing of the ball. Although there was a development of \\"system hockey\\" that overcame the stick/ball skill deficiencies of the Europeans compared with India and Pakistan at the time, it was not as fluid as the kind of one and two touch passing game common in soccer and that ideal was (and still is) a long way off. The hook \\"Hook\\" manufactured by Grays circa 1986 In 1982 a Dutch inventor, Toon Coolen, patented a hockey stick with a \\"hook\\" head. The hockey stick manufacturers Grays took the design up in 1983 and the first mass-produced hockey sticks, with laminated timber head parts, were manufactured in Pakistan. This new design was possible because of the development of epoxy resin glues that did not require perfectly dry timber for bonding and curing to a strength that could cope with the immense stresses placed on a stick head when a hockey ball is struck with it. By 1993 the \\"Hook\\" patent, had been ruled (following a court case in Germany) to protect only hook shapes within 20¬∞ of the vaguely written \\"nearly 180¬∞\\" (referring to the degree of upturn of the toe in relation to the shaft of the stick in the patent description; the shaft of the handle being described a being bent through \\"nearly 180¬∞\\" to form the hook shape of the stick head). That opened the way for the appearance of more J-shaped stick heads and the gradual morphing of the \\"midi\\" shape with the hook shape. In that year also a patent application, lodged in Pakistan in 1987 by Martin Conlon, for a kinked shaft hockey stick, with a set-back head (which was also hook shaped, but not to \\"near 180¬∞\\"), was granted after strong opposition in Pakistan. (Indian and UK patents had been granted in 1988, although the same company had also opposed the UK patent application). Mr. Conlon designed and imported to the UK the first J-head sticks in 1990 but, prior to the 1993 decision, other distributors and manufacturers had been very reluctant to order made or produce hook style sticks of any sort, because of uncertainty about the strength of the patent that \\"ring-fenced\\" the hook hockey stick. The \\"midi\\" head Comparison of \\"One-piece\\" and \\"midi\\" style stick heads Comparison of horizontal head length of \\"hook\\" and a standard short head stick \\"English\\" stick head and the \\"Ultra Short\\" The death knell of the ultra short head was sounded in 1986, due to the introduction of the midi head shape, produced with a laminating process; although of course many players continued to use \\"one-piece\\" short head sticks for many years after that date and many thousands more of them were manufactured. The reason for the continued use of the one piece was that the midi length was similar to that of the more popular one piece stick heads that had been around for the previous ten or so years. Some one piece constructions were still being produced on presses on which the central boss had not been modified and the heel bend was \\"slower\\" than on that of the production of the more aware manufacturers, but the more \\"go ahead\\" manufacturers were producing a one piece that could compete well with the laminated midi‚Äîat least as far as playing functionality was concerned. The biggest casualty of the midi was the patented Hook produced by the same company. It had not taken off in the UK culture of the short-head stick and for a number of years after the midi was introduced the Hook was seen as something of a novelty, even as an indoor stick or a stick exclusively for goalkeepers. In fact versions of it were produced specifically for goalkeepers, with a very extended toe (6 in‚Äî150 mm or more) and that development continued until some were made with the toe extending nearly the length of the handle and the FIH stepped in and ruled that the vertical toe limit was in future to be 4 in (100 mm). The hook was 124 mm, measured horizontally across face of the stick head, when the handle was held vertically; the midi was 113 mm; many one piece heads between 110 mm and 115 mm, and the unusable ultra short 94 mm. A difference of only 30 mm between the head length of a stick that was considered cumbersome (although the Hook also had the height of the toe causing a feeling of imbalance) to one that was considered too short to easily play with. There were still many players playing quite happily with a stick with a head length of 7 in (175 mm), but players buying new sticks were now conscious of quite subtle differences in stick feel and performance due to length, shape, and the distribution of head weight‚Äînot just the total ounce weight and the \\"swing weight or balance\\" of the stick‚Äîand for the first time, in the years after 1986, were being offered a wide range of hockey sticks from a greatly increased number of manufacturers, from which to choose what suited them. After the arrival of the laminations, some brands were offering as many as ten different shapes or styles of stick head on the traditional shaft. The arrival of composites would complicate the picture further. In the early 1990s there were an astonishing number and variety of hockey sticks on offer compared with what had been available ten years earlier. By 1992, hockey stick reinforcement was a big issue and composites had been accepted into an (extended) FIH experimental trial period (there was a great deal of concern about the power generated by these new reinforcements and the safety of players). There were also hockey sticks with metal handles and inserted plywood heads (made by the American company Eastons, better known for making baseball bats), as well as the wide range of one piece head sticks still produced and an expanding range of laminated midi and laminated shorties. The metal handled sticks were later banned for \\"safety reasons\\", in what was widely regarded as a political move by the FIH. Heel bend, ball position, hitting & stopping It may be noted from the diagram above that no matter how \\"tight\\" the heel bend, reversing the stick head over the ball, with a \\"traditional\\" style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than in the middle of the shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10¬∞ off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical. One of the incidental effects of the tighter heel bend of the modern stick is an increase in playing reach with the optimum striking or stopping part of the head of the stick when used in the normal range of playing angles. Held parallel the distance between the curve of the base of the stick head and the top of the handle is the same in the two sticks illustrated. At an angle of 45¬∞, as shown, there is a difference of approximately 3 cm. Tighter bend giving greater hitting and stopping reach Ball positioned mid-face of long head and ball positioned against face of modern hook The positioning of the ball mid-face on the stick head of the modern stick, compared with the mid-face position on the longer stick, also brings the middle of the ball much closer to a line projected through the centre of the handle and the circumference closer to the back edge of the stick, enabling better close control of the ball. \\"English\\" style stick held vertically It will be appreciated after a glance at the illustration of the 'English' style hockey stick that stopping a ball on the ground with the handle held vertically would not be easy. If the ball is lined up centrally with the centre of the handle (red) it would be likely to deflect off the heel side of the head. Even with the ball positioned central to the head (blue) stopping would not have been very secure with an upright handle. Stopping and hitting with the 'English' head Presenting the stick at an angle of 35¬∞ or more (40¬∞ in the illustration) solves the problem of the ball running off the head by presenting a very long area behind the ball (relative to the width of the ball) but presents the problem of the best or optimum position to stop the ball for the following action. For hitting the optimum positions seems to be where a line projected through the leading edge of the shaft of the handle passes through the centre of the ball because it is the position closest to the centre line of the handle where the entire width of the head is behind the ball. Stopping the ball closer to the toe of the stick is acceptable but not optimal, as adjustment, which takes time, is necessary before the next intended action. Stopping and Hitting In the modern stick the vertical handle position is still not as secure as an angled presentation of the handle but the angle now can be considerably less, because of the tighter heel bend and the stopping and hitting positions of the ball are easier to determine. The line of the leading edge of the handle still projects close to the center of the ball when the angle of the stick handle is in the 30¬∞‚Äì50¬∞ range and a line through the centre of the handle will project to the back and underside of the ball. Set-back heads, ball position & stopping Vertical stopping position Set-back on Hook Ball positions on stick heads between \\"slow heel\\" and \\"set- back\\". The illustration called 'Stopping and Hitting' shows that when a vertical stick shaft is aligned to the centre of the ball part of the ball protrudes to the heel side, this would happen even if the heel was not a bend but a 90¬∞ corner and the only way to cover the entire ball with the shaft held vertical is to use a set-back head‚Äîthat is a head that is set-back to the heel side of the shaft. A stick with a set-back head and toe-side protrusion, with the handle positioned vertically, covers substantially more of the ball and can reduce off heel deflection errors in stopping. Using the set-back head in the more comfortable or natural stopping angle puts a vertical area of shaft above the ball while at the same time aligning centre ball and a line projected through the centre of the handle. In the upright hitting position, which is generally between 15¬∞ and 25¬∞ off vertical, the heel bend of the Indian stick of the 1970s will cover the whole ball. As the heel bend gets tighter in the 1980s and 1990s the ball is controlled closer to the centre line of the stick but it is not until the setback stick appears that the centre of the shaft is aligned (or nearly so) with the centre of the ball. The ball appears to move back along the length of the various stick heads as the heads become shorter and the heel tighter, in fact the playing position of the ball is moved further and further from the feet as playing reach is increased. Setback head without shaft protrusion on conventional head. Setback comparison of \\"recurve\\" and \\"kinked shaft\\" sticks There are presently two styles of outfield set-back stick, the degree of setback to the head is a feature they have in common; they differ in that one has a 'kink' or shaft protrusion on the toe side above the head of the stick while the other does not. In the goalkeeper versions some also have the toe of the head cut flat (parallel to the handle) rather than rounded to allow the user to present the stick closer to the ground when stopping in a horizontal position on the reverse side, this is to more easily prevent the ball from going under the handle of the stick. The modern hook In the mid-90s the \\"hook\\" head style hockey stick was relaunched, this time by the former German U21 International player Thomas Kille. Bright colours, bold graphics and painted heads were introduced. Manufacturers became much more aware of the look of their products and hockey sticks sold, particularly to new players, as much on colour and fashion as strength and usability. Comparison of original hook shapes with modern designs. Today, across many brands, there is a choice of angle of hook upturn, 45¬∞, 60¬∞, and 75¬∞. A style of stick that almost no-one in Europe wanted to use in 1987, is today used almost universally; it is difficult now to find a player who is not using a hook style hockey stick and many of them have never used the \\"shortie\\" style at all; just as many of the players of today have never played hockey on a natural grass pitch‚Äîthe development of artificial surfaces has also had a significant effect on the ways in which hockey sticks are used. The original version, the 'Hook' relied on a patent description that put the inner side edge of the toe parallel (or nearly so) to the facing edge of the handle. The vertical height of the toe was approximately 80 mm (dotted line) Fig.1 and it was of almost uniform thickness with the remainder of the stick head. Early modification Fig. 1. reduced the horizontal head length to approximate 115 mm and the 'toe height' to approximately 75 mm. A hockey ball is between about 71 mm and 75 mm in diameter (224‚Äì235 mm in circumference)‚Äîso that put the 'toe height' at the same height as the maximum height of the ball. This is a common feature across hook head designs today, the toe generally varies in height, between the minimum and maximum height of the ball, when the handle is in a vertical position. The next development was a hook with a toe with an inner edge that sloped away from the handle by approximately 30¬∞ (a 60¬∞ angle to the ground or a 150¬∞ 'upturn'. The 'toe height' was 75 mm. (Modern versions Fig. 2 vary between 70 mm and 75 mm. in toe height.) The horizontal length of the head was based on the length of the 'standard' one-piece short-head stick, approximately 110 mm. and modern versions seem to vary between 110 mm and 115 mm. The mid-90s saw the introduction of the more 'open' hooks Fig. 3, some at 45¬∞ and a significant increase in horizontal head length, some as much as 120 mm. New names have been coined to describe the various hook shapes but there is much confusion and overlapping of names. 'Maxi' and 'Mega' are also terms for styles of hook shape but there is no common agreement about what these terms mean outside of each 'brand' name that employs them: what one brand terms a midi another calls a 'hook' but, basically, there are three types of hook. The near symmetrical 'U', a 'tight' or 'closed' toe shape, between 60¬∞ and 75¬∞ and an 'open' shape of 45¬∞‚Äì55¬∞. Where the toe is shorter the same toe angles are generally referred to as midi. Set-back stick heads The curve to the 'heel' side of the handle The big headed 'Hook' also suffered for a short time from the appearance at the 1986 World Cup of the first sticks with set-back heads. There was not a significant impact but it (and others) added to the general confusion, as apparently 'everyone and his dog' were presenting new ideas in head shape. (Metal handled and fully composite sticks had not yet made an appearance so at the time the 'battle' was about head shape and length rather than materials and to a lesser extent, because hockey players at the time tended to be more 'traditionalist', the head/handle configuration. Even reinforcement with fiberglass and carbon fibre was not the issue it was later to become. One hockey stick produced by AREC for the French inventor, Jean Cap√©t, had the centre of the handle aligned with the centre of the horizontal length of the head. There was a lot of promotion based on 'rotational balance' and the 'sweet spot' and 'power hitting'. The 'Hook' certainly felt out of rotational balance, especially to those who had been playing with short-head sticks that had been made with a very thin toe, so as to concentrate the weight of the head closer to the shaft. Aligning the centre of the handle with the centre of the horizontal length of a short-head, rather than with the centre of the ball created some unusual playing characteristics, for example, the reversed-stick ball position being further from the feet than the forehand ball position, which is the opposite of what happens with a conventional 'traditional' handle head configuration. (When the centre line of the handle aligns with the centre of the ball‚Äîor very nearly so‚Äîthere is no or very little difference in ball position in relation to the stick or the feet of the player between the forehand and reverse playing positions.) The AREC stick was initially produced without a significantly upturned toe and had a short horizontal length (approximately 105 mm), it was in this regard similar to standard short-head sticks of the time. The lack of an upturned toe, combined with the unusual reverse ball position, caused some difficulty in adapting to the stick and when the horizontal head lengths of sticks began to be made longer, by popular demand. A stick with the handle aligned to the centre of the head length was no longer practical for playing hockey. Manufacture of it as an outfield stick ceased in the early 1990s, probably by 1992 but similar sticks, by other manufacturers, have appeared for goalkeeper use. Kinked- shaft & recurve heads The traditional small arc to the heel edge of the hockey stick had the effect of setting the stick head back slightly. This aspect of stick design (of which the AREC hockey stick was an extreme example) was first explored just prior to the Men's Hockey World Cup of 1986 and resulted in the production of hockey sticks with a stick head considerably more set-back in relation to the handle. The original design, aligning the centre line of the handle with the centre of the ball, in the common striking position, featured a counterbalancing \\"kink\\" or protrusion to the handle on the toe edge of the handle, just above the head of the stick. This invention of the kinked-shaft and set-back head stick led directly to rules governing the amount of bend or \\"permitted deviation\\" to the \\"edge sides\\" of the hockey stick handle. Some of these were later termed \\"recurve\\" heads (a description given to a later style, produced by an Australian manufacturer, without the patented kink feature.) The extremes The early extremes in stick design were in those sticks intended for use by goalkeepers. The aim was simply to present the maximum stopping area to the ball. The first was the extended hook (far left), which was made with a toe of approximately 150 mm (6 in). When sticks with an upturn substantially more than that (some more than half the length of the handle) began to appear, which was around 1988, the FIH placed a limit of 100 mm (4\\") on the upturn of the toe of the head. In 1990 a plywood cutout of a stick with multiple kinks in the shaft was presented to the FIH for comment, the intention was to produce it as a goalkeeper's stick. Having limited the toe upturn only two years previously the FIH saw this as mockery and issued a press release, in April 1990, proposing a ban on all hockey sticks with \\"non- straight\\" handles to take effect after the Barcelona Olympics of that year. There was protest from those who had been marketing sticks with set-back heads and or kinked shafts and it was in any case not a sensible proposal because there is no such thing as a hockey stick with a perfectly straight handle. The result was the withdrawal of the proposed ban and the imposition of \\"limits of deviation\\", which permitted one bend to either side of the handle to a maximum of 20 mm on each side. In 2000 a diagram explaining the permitted deviation was included in the Rules of Hockey. Previously the only restraint on the configuration of a hockey stick was that it had to pass through a ring of 2\\" diameter (later adjusted to 51 mm‚Äî2 in rounded up to the nearest millimeter). Permitted deviation  Although permitted deviation (from the straight) to the edges of a hockey stick (handle) were included in the 1991 Rules of Hockey, a diagram of a hockey stick, to illustrate what was permitted was not included until 2000 and then it was a part stick diagram placed horizontally on a page smaller than the A6 page of the present rulebook. The diagram was very poorly drawn but it was a significant step for the FIH to include it at all. The diagram remained unchanged until 2004, when the orientation was altered so that the stick was shown upright and it was also shown full length. The x-axis (previously vertical) became the ground plane and the y-axis a vertical line through the centre of the handle. Further improvements to the diagram (particularly the drawing of the representation of the stick and an illustration of possible curves to the handle) were made in 2006 and a second diagram, detailing head configuration, was added. Limits of deviation with sample of an actual stick superimposed in green. Limits of deviation, sample curves. To describe the dimensions of head and handle the hockey stick is envisaged to be placed with the bottom curve of the stick head on a level surface, the x-axis, with the stick-handle perpendicular to it (the y-axis). The y-axis runs from an intersection with the x-axis (0) vertically through the midpoint of the top of the handle. The Head is the part from the x-axis to the line C-C (diagram) a vertical distance of 100 mm. This line C-C also describes the limit on any upturn to the toe of the head. By Rule there is no limit to the length of the stick head along the x-axis, but practical considerations, as well as technicalities related to the joining of the head and the Handle (on the line C-C), did create limitations with wooden sticks. The extent of the stick head along the X+ axis, towards the 'heel' of the Head is confined by the rule requirement that the stick head and the handle meet in a smooth continuous fashion at the line C-C and by a rule restriction on the shape of the handle, which is that the stick-handle must not project beyond the line B1-B1. It is possible to envisage a stick where the width of handle did not extend beyond the line A1-A1, thus allowing a significant extension of the stick head along the X+ axis, but the practicalities of such a design seem to be limited and have not been explored. The length of the Head (or toe) along the X- axis has varied enormously, especially since the Second World War and again after the introduction of the timber lamination process in the early 1980s. The stick handle may be bent or 'deviated', in a smooth curve only, once only to either side. That is the handle may have one out-moving curve on the 'heel' side of the head and one out-moving curve on the toe side. It is therefore possible to have a hockey stick with a handle deviation to the front or toe side or a handle deviation to the back or 'heel' side or a stick-handle that is bent once to both the toe and 'heel' sides. The sample diagram on the right shows three deviating areas (a), (b), and (c). Any of these areas could exist on a stick by itself but, in this illustration, area (a) could legally coexist with area (b) and area (c) could coexist with area (b); but areas (a) and (c) could not legally coexist on the same stick because they are both on the same edge and only one protrusion either beyond the line AA or beyond the line A1A1‚Äîor both‚Äîis permitted on the handle. The maximum permitted width of the handle (51 mm) is illustrated in the diagram by the distance between the dotted lines A-A and A1-A1. A hockey stick handle will rarely be of the maximum permitted width: most are between 46 mm and 48 mm at the widest point. Sample goalkeeper stick with long edge deviation to toe side The maximum permitted 'deviation' is shown by the lines B-B and B1-B1 respectively. The line B-B is 20 mm further along the X- axis than the line A-A and the line B1-B1 is 20 mm further along the X+ axis than the line A1-A1. There is no limit to the length of a protrusion along the y-axis specified, so the deviation curve or curves may be of any length along the length of the stick- handle. Some goalkeeping sticks have an outward curve on the toe side (within the line B-B) that extends for almost half the total length of the stick. The sample illustrated does not reach the line A1A1 on the 'heel edge' and the Y axis is not central to the shaft, which raises the question \\"How is the stick positioned for measurement of permitted deviation.\\" The answer is that the vertical axis Y runs through the top centre of the handle and the stick is assumed to be suspended from that top centre point and perpendicular to the X axis (the ground), the curve to the base of the head of the stick being in contact with the ground, it is therefore not necessary for the Y axis to pass through the centre of the shaft just above the head of the stick, although in most traditional sticks it will do so (or very nearly do so‚Äîas 'rake' to the handle may cause the Y axis to run a few millimeters to the heel side of the true centre of the shaft). To October 2015 no official measuring method or device for measuring 'permitted deviation' has been approved by the FIH. Permitted bow Increasing the degree of bow to the face side (flat side) makes it easier to get high speeds from the drag-flick (a \\"sling-shot\\" style stroke started from behind the body of the flicker) and allows easier execution of the stroke. At first, after extreme bows were introduced (2005), the Hockey Rules Board (HRB) placed a limit of 50 mm on the maximum depth of such a bow over the length of the stick, but experience quickly demonstrated this degree of bend to be excessive. The Rules of Hockey 2006 limited this particular curve of the stick to 25 mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked and to try to ensure that hitting control was maintained (the curvature to the face of the stick considerably influences the angle at which the stick head strikes through the ball). The placement of the maximum bow along the length of handle has now been specified in the Rules of Hockey at 20 cm above the head (the line C-C). Ascertaining compliance to bow limits It is now illegal for any hockey stick to have a bow that exceeds 25 mm. The bow height is measured by placing the stick face-side to a flat surface and presenting the official measuring device, a 25 mm-high metal triangular or cylindrical measure, to the gap between the surface and the under-flat of the stick. Since this article was first written in 2008, there have been attempts to get around the rule by the production of a stick which 'in a natural resting position' has a face side that is not parallel to the flat surface measured from but rests with the face at a sharp angle. The result of the sloping of the face side is to put one edge of it closer than 25 mm to the flat surface and permit a much deeper bow than would otherwise be possible. This flouts the intention of the rule, so it is possible that there may be a move to a measuring cylinder, under and across, the entire face of the stick. Position of bow and effect on angle of head presentation There was a development in design called the 'low bow'. This placed the maximum bow of the stick much closer to the head than was previously the case, when it was positioned more centrally on the length of the stick. The effect of placing the maximum bow lower down the handle was to increase the angle at which the stick head was presented to the ball. The angle of presentation of a '25 mm low bow' was approximately the same as was achieved when the maximum permitted bow was 50 mm but the maximum was situated at about the mid-length of the stick. Extreme bow has an effect on the ease with which stick-work and hitting of the ball (so that it stays on the ground) may be carried out. There has always been some bow to a stick handle, 10‚Äì20 mm was common (right in diagram) because to have a stick that was straight would make 'gathering' the ball, by pulling it towards the body from the left, more difficult and a bow in the other direction (a convex bow) would cause 'dragging' in stick-work and make hitting the ball cleanly difficult in the other. A stick with a very small degree of bow (no more than 5 mm) was popular in the days when the clip hit in the outfield was a permitted stroke (a chip hit is a hit down on the top or back of the ball which causes it to rise sharply and produces under-spin, so that the ball does not run on when it lands). The increased use of the scoop when the lifted hit in the outfield was banned led to an increase in bow depth (and many players also found that a moderate bow aided stick-work as well). The maximum depth of this bow was generally at around the mid-length of the stick. The 'low bow' has been popularized by the development of the drag- flick, particularly as a first shot on goal at a penalty corner. The Pakistan International player Sohail Abbas, who holds the record for the number of goals scored at international level, mostly scored with the set piece drag- flick, had such a stick made especially to his own requirements and many have copied his design‚Äîand tried to improve on it. Hitting at various stick angles with a bowed stick. Although there can be no doubt that the 'slingshot' effect of a bowed stick, when the ball is 'dragged' from the rear of the feet and released after powerful body and arm rotation to the front of the feet, has dramatically increased the velocity at which the ball may be propelled by this flicking method, there may be considerable difficulty in hitting the ball along the ground with a very bowed stick. This may be of advantage when shooting at the goal with a lifted hit from within the 'circle' (which is legal) but a disadvantage when hitting the ball outside of the scoring 'circles', because it is illegal to intentionally lift the ball with a hit except when within the scoring 'circles' i.e. the opponent's 'circle'. The upright forehand hitting stroke, which is commonly used when the ball is close to the feet, will seldom be made with the handle in the same plane as the ball, unless the ball is to the immediate right of the player i.e. beside or alongside his feet. (Stick shown on far right of illustration)‚Äîwhich is generally the case when the ball is being hit directly to the front or from left to right‚Äîwith a bowed stick even this vertical handle position will present an angled head to the ball. The further away to the front of the player the ball is the greater will be the head angle presented to the ball. To deal with the problem of head presentation some players use a low 'roundhouse' style of hitting, rather than an upright style and may also employ sweep-hits or slap-hitting of the ball (the difference being the positioning of the hands, sweep hits are generally made with the hands together at the top of the stick and with the base of the stick head in contact with the ground, while slap-hits are usually made with the hands in the more spread dribbling grip and the stick head is not necessarily in contact with the ground, but it may be), either sweep or slap type strokes give greater control over the angle of the face of the stick as it makes contact with the ball and are often the preferred strokes when passing the ball over longer distances (over shorter distances‚Äîless than 20 m‚Äîa push stroke is often preferred). Stick-face contact position: Ball contact position. The detail illustration shows that when the handle is angled away from the ball both the position of contact with the ball on the ball and the part of the face of the stick making contact will be altered. The greater the bow the greater the degree of adjustment the player must make to his swing and to the hitting position of the ball to achieve a hit flat along the ground. Stages of development The development of the modern hockey stick has not taken place in one continuous flow with each development following on from a previous one. Many things changed in the same time frame but at different speeds, especially some of the later developments. There have been more changes in stick design in the last twenty-five years than there were in the previous one hundred and twenty-five and the pace of change has been an ever increasing one. There will no doubt be further development, probably in materials, possibly because of changes to the rules. In roughly chronological order this is what has happened so far. * 1860s: Hockey taken to India. Stick head made shorter; move from ash to mulberry timber for the stick head. ** Further shortening of stick head; heel of head made tighter. Taken as far as possible by 1986, when a move back towards a midi length began. * 1960s: Reinforcement with fiberglass. * 1970s: Reinforcement with carbon and aramid as well as glass fibres. * 1980s: Stick heads made from glued lamination of wood in addition to the one piece heads * 1982: Introduction of upturned toe, first the hook closely followed by midi and \\"J\\" shaped designs. * 1980s: Limit placed on upturn of toe of head at 100 mm. * 1986: Kinked shaft stick. Set back stick head. * 1980s: Stick lengths other than 36\\", up to 39\\", become widely available and custom lengths 42\\"+ can be purchased. * 1990: Permitted deviation rule‚Äîlimited bends to edges of stick handle defined. * 1990: Specialist goalkeeper's sticks introduced, the first being the ZigZag Save. * 1980s: Metal handled stick with an inserted wooden head (plywood) introduced. * 1994: Composite sticks fully accepted in rules after a two-year \\"experiment\\". * 1990s: Metal handles banned. * 2004: Rule redefining of head and handle. Head the part from the base of the curve perpendicular to 100 mm‚Äîhandle the remainder of the stick. * 2000s: Refinement of head shapes, probably five shapes available as \\"standard\\". * 2000s: Number of wood core sticks in use declines as moulded \\"composites\\" become the norm. * 2006: Bow of the face of the handle is increased to facilitate drag-flicking. Closely followed by a rule concerning maximum permitted bow; initially at 50 mm and subsequently at 25 mm. * 2007: Low bow sticks introduced. * 2011: Maximum stick bow position not permitted to be less than 8\\" (20 cm) above the head of the stick. * 2013: Maximum permitted weight reduced to 737 g (26 oz) * 2015: Maximum length limit of 41\\" (105 cm)introduced. The forehand striking position Ball position for propelling For the purposes of this article the ball will be assumed to be 73 mm in diameter. Ball size does play a significant part in stickwork and ball control (as does the weight and hardness of the ball) but an investigation of these is outside the scope of this article. The width of stick handles does vary (as does the horizontal length of stick heads) but for clarity and convenience the shaft of the handle just above the head has been taken as 46 mm, which is fairly common, and the sticks scaled from that measurement. The position of the ball when it is played, particularly hit with the stick head, does, however have a bearing on stick head design. Using just one of the whole range of angles the ball may be struck at from the forehand (right-hand) side (45¬∞), the position of the ball will be looked at in relation to both the centre of the head of the stick and a line projected to run through the centre of the handle. An examination on the position of wear on the base of stick heads that have been used over a period on an abrasive playing surface lead to the conclusion that the ball is positioned close to the center of the head length of the modern stick. This is also the more usual position for receiving or stopping the ball in play while in the 'dribbling crouch'. Obviously when the handle is vertical or horizontal there is considerable variation but in most common hitting and dribbling positions the line of the uppermost edge of the handle projects close to the centre of the ball. One of the problems with a striking head that is significantly narrower than the diameter of the ball is that the ball is easily lifted unintentionally if struck with the face of the stick head inclined backward, 'open', rather than vertical or nearly so. Striking the ball with a 'closed' face is not always a solution, because it is then possible to 'squeeze' or 'clip' it, again causing the ball to rise, possibly even more steeply than with the so-called 'undercut' hit. Another difficulty is striking the ball accurately at the point on the stick head that is intended (the usual range of error can be seen, in the diagram, in the difference of the lengths of the red lines that run from the centre of the two differently positioned stick heads). It is also necessary to avoid unintentionally turning the handle during a hit at the ball so that the ball is \\"sliced\\" (to the right) or hooked (to the left), this is achieved by gripping the stick firmly, generally with one hand locked against the other at the top of the handle, at the moment of impact with the ball. Ensuring vertical and flat (perpendicular to intended direction of ball travel) contact with the ball is in the hands of the player and the coach, but achieving a correct contact position between the stick head and the ball can be helped by the design of the stick. \\"Heel\\" position, toe height At a common playing angle three different styles of hook stick head present identical ball/handle relationships because the bend of the 'heel' is the same in each stick. An increase in the height of the toe over the ball is very noticeable and is most pronounced in the more 'open' shape. The modern hook does not suffer from the effects of a rotational imbalance in the head as much as the original did because stick heads are now generally tapered towards the toe, rather than of uniform thickness so toe height is not, from a weight and rotational balance point of view, as much of an issue as it once might have been. The stick head is also generally tapered from the midpoint of the striking area towards the bottom curve, so when the stick is in the reversed position the maximum thickness of the head is not at the highest point. This gives a more balanced rotation of the weight of the stick head over the ball. Some of the early hooks were actually thinner in the centre and became thicker in the toe; it is likely that this was done to facilitate more powerful reversed-stick hitting of the ball but it gave the stick unusual handling characteristics when turning it over the ball and back in \\"stickwork\\": an \\"overturning\\" or \\"throw\\" of the stick head had to be taken into account. The composite stick is generally lighter than the previous wood versions and it is unusual these days to find a young player using the 25‚Äì26 oz sticks that were quite commonly used on grass in the 1970s, especially by those likely to be regularly taking hits at a stationary ball.

Early life and education He entered the army as an ensign in the 2nd Dragoons in 1741, and attended Eton from 1742 to 1743. That year he was promoted to lieutenant, and in 1746 became a captain of the 18th Regiment of Foot. Seven Years' War Gordon was returned for Aberdeenshire in 1754, and was made lieutenant-colonel of the 3rd Foot Guards in 1756. He supported the recently fallen Duke of Newcastle during the parliamentary inquiry into his ministry's role in the loss of Menorca. In 1758, he took part in the descent on Cherbourg, and fought bravely at the Battle of St. Cast, leading the grenadier company of the Guards as part of the rearguard there. Gordon continued in Parliament after the 1761 election as a supporter of the rising Lord Bute. On 19 January 1763, he was made colonel of the 66th Regiment of Foot, and the next year, toured the West Indies, the American colonies, and Canada, looking to invest in land. He returned to England in 1765. On 2 September 1767, he married Jean, Dowager Duchess of Atholl (daughter of John Drummond), and laid aside his American projects. He left Parliament in 1768, but returned again for Kincardineshire in 1774. He had, by 1772, been promoted major-general. On 27 December 1775, Gordon was appointed colonel of the 26th Regiment of Foot, but he did not receive a command during the American Revolution. A zealous supporter of Lord North's government, he was appointed Governor of Tynemouth in 1778 and colonel of The Royal Scots on 9 May 1782. Unhappy with the terms of the Treaty of Paris and the fate of the loyalists, he supported the new ministry of Pitt in 1783. He left Parliament in 1788. Gordon was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1789, promoted general in 1793, and resigned Tynemouth for the governorship of Edinburgh Castle in 1796. He was replaced as Commander-in-Chief in 1798 and retired to his seat in Kincardineshire, where he died in 1801.

It is the only species in the genus, and is fairly small (about 150 mm). The mantle is covered by large, multi-pointed cartilagenous tubercles. When disturbed, the squid often pulls its head and arms into the mantle cavity and folds its fins tightly against the mantle to form a turgid ball. The tubercules, presumably, provide some type of protection, but it is unclear what predators are affected and how. In addition, the squid may ink into the mantle cavity, making the ball opaque. This was thought to be an aberrant behavior due to stress and confinement of shipboard aquaria until the same inking behavior was seen in cranchiids from submersibles. The function of this behavior is unknown.. The genus contains bioluminescent species. It is named for John Cranch.

The cartoon was released on March 6, 1948, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. Plot Porky is looking all over the big city for a hotel room, but due to a convention there are no vacancies. Porky takes the only available vacancy at one hotel, but will have to share with Daffy Duck, who is a very loud, obnoxious and annoying sort. Daffy introduces his invisible kangaroo friend \\"Hymie\\" (a reference to Harvey), but Porky denies the kangaroo's existence despite evidence from Daffy getting inside Hymie's 'pouch', becoming partially invisible, and Hymie jumping around with Daffy riding in it. Daffy spends the rest of the night annoying Porky: pestering him with questions, shaking the bed, spilling water from a glass, hogging the blanket and finally literally sending the both of them flying off the bed when Daffy kicks, and startles, Porky with his literally frozen feet. Fed up with his antics, Porky stuffs Daffy in a pillow case and drops him out of the window. As Porky goes back to sleep, Daffy returns bandaged, but shakes the bandages off and prepares to get revenge. Daffy tricks the half-asleep pig into stepping out of a window thinking he's boarding a train. Daffy pulls down the blind saying it's \\"too gruesome\\" to watch. Suddenly he hears train noises, and behind the shade, sees the still-drowsy Porky pulling away on an actual train and waving goodbye at Daffy. Daffy finds this silly, saying that he should've bought Porky some magazines to read on his trip. Then he bounces all around the room, \\"Hoo-Hoo!\\"-ing wildly. Production notes The title is a play on the clich√©, \\"George Washington slept here.\\" The film is a sequel to 1947's A Pest in the House, which also features Daffy disturbing a hotel patron's sleep.

She laments that she's not quite \\"up to date\\", but believes that dancing like \\"Sister Kate\\" will rectify this, and she will be able to impress \\"all the boys in the neighborhood\\" like her sister. Over the years this song has been performed and recorded by many artists, including Frances Faye and Rusty Warren, a 1959 version by Shel Silverstein, The Olympics in 1960 (released as \\"Shimmy Like Kate\\"), the Red Onion Band, and a beat version by The Remo Four in 1964. It was performed live by The Beatles in 1962, and a recording of one such performance appears on Live! at the Star- Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962. The song arrived in the 1960s and 1970s folk scene thanks to Dave Van Ronk (recording it twice on In the Tradition and on Dave Van Ronk and the Ragtime Jug Stompers) and Jim Kweskin, who made it part of a \\"Sister Kate's Night Out\\" medley on his Relax Your Mind albumTrussel.com with Mel Lyman and Fritz Richmond.

Guitarist Carlos Alomar blessed the update with a riff that became Bowie's hit \\"Fame\\", cowritten with John Lennon. Judith Durham recorded a version for her album, Judith Durham and The Hottest Band in Town (1974). The song was also featured in an episode of All in the Family during the show's final (1978) season, in which Edith and Stephanie plan to sing the song for a talent show at Stephanie's school.

Born in Woolley Colliery, a pit village near Barnsley,McIlroy, J. (2004) \\"Al Richardson (1941-2003): An Appreciation\\", Revolutionary History Vol.8, No.4 p.3 Richardson studied theology at the University of Hull before becoming a lecturer at the University of Exeter. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, but left after reading Isaac Deutscher's biography of Leon Trotsky. Convinced of Trotskyism, he joined the Socialist Labour League (SLL), and resigned from the faculty at Exeter to become a history teacher in Forest Hill School, South London. He soon quit the SLL to join the rival International Marxist Group (IMG), and became prominent in the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign. Despite hitchhiking to Paris to join the events of May 1968, Richardson was part of a small group which rejected the IMG's turn away from trade unions and the labour movement to work in the student movement. He became a founder member of the break-away Revolutionary Communist League, and was elected to its leadership, but in 1973 he left the League. From the mid-1970s, Richardson focussed his attention on recording the history of Trotskyism in Britain. He began interviewing veterans of the movement, and with Sam Bornstein, published three books on the topic through their \\"Socialist Platform\\" publishing house. In 1988 they founded the journal Revolutionary History, dedicated to the history of the anti-Stalinist left. Richardson worked with various Trotskyist groups, in particular Workers Liberty, Workers Action and the Militant tendency, whose approaches he felt were closest to his own. In contrast to these groups, he opposed any race, gender or sexuality based campaigns, which he believed were popular frontist. But he never abandoned the work inside Labour, because he believed that the revolutionary party can emerge only from a mass working-class party. He continued teaching and writing until his death.

The building houses grades 9-12 and functions as the primary athletic building. It is the only high school in the Maconaquah School Corporation. History On July 1, 1962, Maconaquah School Corporation was formed by consolidating two high schools (Clay and Bunker Hill) in southern Miami County, Indiana. The corporation is named after Frances Slocum, who was captured as a child by Delaware Indians in 1778 from her Pennsylvania home. She grew up with the Miami tribe and married a Miami Indian Chief. She lived in the area near Peru, Indiana, and became known as \\"Little Bear Woman\\" or Maconaquah. She is buried in a state historical site near the corporation boundaries. Maconaquah class of 1964 attended classes in the old Bunker Hill High School. The current high school facility, located approximately 2 miles from Bunker Hill, Indiana, proper, held its first classes in August 1965. The following year the building proper was finished and the class of 1966 was the first to attend in MHS. Three years later, the Industrial Arts/Agriculture Wing was added on, allowing students to gain insight into different trades and career paths. In 1977, the Fine Arts Wing was added, expanding the school, with the additions including a 900+ seat auditorium with a full scene shop, a band room, a choral chamber, a green room, a black-box theater (later converted into a television studio), as well as numerous classrooms. The most recent addition is the remodeling of the Science and Business Department in 2005: The science laboratories were updated, and an additional lab was built. The building has two multi-purpose computer labs, CAD lab, accounting lab, Cisco Network Academy, and a graphic arts lab. Each teacher has a room computer with access to Internet, Web and various programs. Teachers also have access to video, digital cameras, VCR, laser disc, film strip, CD-Rom, still video, 35mm slides, 16mm film, satellite TV, in-house TV, and voice mail. The high school continues to serve constituents of six townships in southern Miami County (population: approximately 36,000). The district includes a farming community and nine small towns or communities and includes Grissom Air Reserve Base. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 656 students enrolled in 2015-2016 was: *Male - 50.2% *Female - 49.8% *Native American/Alaskan - 1.1% *Asian/Pacific islanders - 1.4% *Black - 2.1% *Hispanic - 3.0% *White - 86.7% *Multiracial - 5.7% 45.0% of the students were eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch. In 2015-2016, this was a Title I school.  Academics  Maconaquah High School (MHS) is accredited by the Indiana Department of Public Instruction.  Band Program  The Marching Braves competes in the Indiana State School Music Association (ISSMA) competitions.

It was directed by Walt Disney and animated by Ub Iwerks, with music by Carl Stalling. It was the ninth Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the sixth of that year. The short was produced in black and white by The Walt Disney Studio and released to theaters by Celebrity Productions. It is the ninth film in the Mickey Mouse film series, and the first in which Mickey speaks. (During his first eight appearances Mickey whistled, laughed, cried and otherwise vocally expressed himself.) Mickey's first spoken line is \\"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\\", the voice being provided by composer Carl Stalling instead of Walt Disney. Three other recurring characters of the series also appear. The first is Clarabelle Cow in a cameo. The second is a carnival barker -- \\"a direct forerunner, in both looks and behavior, of the later comics character Kat Nipp.\\" The third is Mickey's recurring love interest, Minnie Mouse. Synopsis The Karnival Kid is broken into two distinct segments. The first segment features Mickey selling hot dogs at a carnival. The second segment is set later that night and features Mickey, accompanied by two cats, in a moonlight serenade. The short opens to the scene of a bustling carnival. After a few initial sight gags, the action quickly focuses on Kat Nipp, a barker at the carnival who is enticing a crowd to see Minnie, \\"the Shimmy Dancer.\\" Mickey stands nearby, selling hot dogs and taunting Nipp. Nipp briefly gets into a dispute with Mickey over a dancing doll scam. However, Minnie soon notices Mickey and calls him over to order a hot dog. She takes a coin out of her stocking to pay, but Mickey, who is clearly attracted to her, refuses to accept the coin and gives it to her for free. When she bites into the hot dog, it screams and runs away. Mickey catches it and spanks it, concluding the first segment. Much of the humor in this segment comes from the interaction between Mickey and his hot dogs, with the latter tending to act like actual dogs in relation to their owner/trainer. In the second segment, Mickey attempts to draw Minnie's attention by playing guitar outside her window. He is joined by two alley cats who noisily sing along. The sound delights Minnie but awakens an irate Kat Nipp, who had been resting in a nearby trailer. Nipp starts throwing things at the three annoyances in an attempt to silence them. The short ends as Mickey is hit with an entire bed and knocked dizzy. Stalling's score for The Karnival Kid features two notable themes. During the \\"Shimmy Dance\\" sequence, a monkey, performing as a one-man band, plays the Snake Charmer song, the common name for The Streets of Cairo. During the moonlight serenade segment, Mickey and the cats perform a rendition of the barbershop standard Sweet Adeline. Production This was the first cartoon in which Mickey speaks. Walt Disney was thrilled by the progress, but Pat Powers of Celebrity Pictures wasn't; he worried that Mickey speaking English would affect overseas sales of the cartoons. In Mickey's Movies: The Theatrical Films of Mickey Mouse, Gijs Grob observes: \\"The Karnival Kid shows that lip synchronization was far more difficult to master than synchronized sound itself. The animation of the mouth to form syllables was a totally new feat, and initially it was done all too literally. This led to awkward facial expressions at times, with especially Mickey's face distorting into a multitude of mouth gestures. The problem would become even worse in Mickey's next cartoon, Mickey's Follies.\\" The hot dog gags are reused from an earlier film, Disney's 1927 Oswald the Lucky Rabbit short All Wet. Legacy and influence Mickey's first words later inspired the \\"Hot Dog\\" song from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The scene where Mickey tips his ears to Minnie inspired storyman Roy Williams to invent the Mickey Mouse ears hat. Ub Iwerks reused elements of the plot and many of the visual gags from The Karnival Kid in his 1932 cartoon, Circus. The part of the hot dog vendor is played by Flip the Frog.Flip the Frog, in Circus New York Weenie, an episode from the 2013 Mickey Mouse shorts series, shares similar themes and gags with The Karnival Kid. The episode was directed by Aaron Springer, most notable for his work on SpongeBob SquarePants. Artist Bruce Conner included the final shot in his film \\"3 Screen Ray\\". An LCD Game & Watch-styled mini- game based on the short appears in the 2019 video game Kingdom Hearts III. Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Carl Stalling * Minnie Mouse: Walt Disney * Barker: Walt Disney * Singing cats: Carl Stalling Reception The Film Daily (September 1, 1929): \\"Very Good: Mickey Mouse does his cartoonatics as a hot dog vendor at the circus grounds. The hot dogs come to life and the cartoonist gets a series of clever and funny gags that will make anybody laugh. Winds up with a serenade by two cats assisting Mickey win his gal. Clever, in the way that this series has grown to have a habit of being quite consistently.\\" See also *Mickey Mouse (film series) References External links * Category:Disney animated short films, 1920s Category:1929 films Category:1929 animated films Category:1929 comedy films Category:Mickey Mouse short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1920s American animated films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Walt Disney Category:Films directed by Ub Iwerks Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:1929 short films ","title":"The Karnival Kid"},{"id":"7100269","text":"Hantu Air, Puaka Air or Mambang Air is the Malay translation for Spirit of the Water, which according to animist traditions in Maritime Southeast Asia, is the unseen inhabitant of watery places such as rivers, lakes, seas, swamps and even ditches. Communication between humans and Hantu Air occur in situations based on the well-being of an environment and can be positive or negative. Water spirits are called on and communicated with through ceremonies, rituals, incantations, and in extreme cases exorcisms. Hantu Air is associated with bad things happening to people including missing persons, drowning, flooding and many other incidents.  Origin  The identification of incantations and rituals can be derived from the indigenous, Hindu, or Islamic origins. These origins influenced the cultural belief that everything contained a supernatural soul or essence. For a long time animism and dinamism were widely practiced in Maritime Southeast Asia. Locals would associate almost anything with the spiritual world, including nature. The civilization of Maritime Southeast Asia believed that the well-being and success of humans was dependent on the spirits which inhabited the environment. The spirits are considered powerful entities that spread throughout the environment and are identified as being either good or evil. Determining whether a spirit is good or evil depends on the interaction between spirit and human. A positive interaction invokes the benevolent spirits which are treated similar to pets and help their owners with endeavors. This relationship is a mutual companionship to maintain the well-being of an environment. A negative interaction invokes the malevolent spirits which cause disease. Negative associations commonly occur when the spirits are disturbed from their home. In that case, one's health would decline and may become very ill. A pawang would have to identify the spirit, address the issue, and correct the wrong doing. Then the person who became ill can heal and return to proper health. Based on the severity of harm done from the malevolent spirits, the pawang can either peaceful negotiate with the spirits or exorcize them. To conduct an exorcism, the pawang may need to perform a seance to cleanse evil influence off a person, object, or place. This includes purification and neutralization processes. Hantu Air is used to explain any sickness or death associated with watery areas that cannot be otherwise explained. Some people believe that spirits discarded by their previous owners will haunt places associated with water. The unguided and lost spirit roams the area and feeds on anything available, including humans. Superstitions arising among the locals tell of this evil spirit dwelling in watery places where it sometimes disguises itself as an old tree trunk, a beautiful lady, fish or other animals in order to lure people into its trap. When caught the human will be eaten or drowned. Currently, deaths near watery areas are attributed to outbreaks of Leptospirosis, instead of Hantu Air.http://hospital.com.my/diseases/Rat_Urine_Disease.htm  Contemporary customs  A ceremony called Semah Pantai was once popular among local older Malays, especially in the East Coast of Malaysia. It is a ceremony whereby fishermen and seafarers honor the sea spirits and ask for blessings and protection when they fish at sea. The ritual is used in times of uncertainty or chance. Common practices include chants, small sacrifices, and the use of charms. The people of Malay with the specialties of fishing, navigation, and sailing are called pawang dl-laut or pawang of the sea. The pawang has experience and knowledge that displays the qualifications needed to perform the ceremony. The last ceremony was undertaken on 22 April 1960. The ceremony usually took place every three years and lasted seven days and nights. Syirik dosa yang tidak diampuni Allah, Soal Jawab Bersama Dr. Amran Kasimin Expert fishermen perform rituals as a type of humble communication with the sea spirits asking to guide them to locations with an abundance of fish. During poor fishing seasons in coastal villages, the Semah Pantai ceremony calls on the spirits of the sea in the hope that fish will be provided. In other instances, navigators have been known to stand on the bow of their ship and call on the sea spirits for assistance and guidance when in treacherous or rocky waters. Communication with Hantu Air also occurred when water was needed as a resource for irrigation of crops. Specifically in Maritime Southeast Asia, rice-fields were the main crop source and needed a plentiful amount of irrigation to support the inhabitants. Water spirits where called on when the rivers ran dry from droughts and rituals were often performed. If the Hantu Air feels threatened by the sailors and fishermen, signs will be shown through of lack of fish or deadly seas storms. In extreme cases, Hantu Air is believed to disguise itself as a creature of the sea and drown the people invading its space.

They are also one of seven species in one genus, Nyctibius, located in tropical America. Much like owls, this species is nocturnal. They prey on large insects and small vertebrates, which they capture in sallies from high perches. Possibly its most well known characteristic is its unique moaning growl that the Great Potoo vocalizes throughout the night, creating an unsettling atmosphere in the Neotropics with its nocturnal sounds.  Description  The great potoo has a large head in relation to its body. The eyes are also very large with a brown to yellow iris and has a short but broad beak. Their wings are elliptical in shape and with an elongated tail. The feather colors vary with white, gray, black, and burgundy. The tail colors match with that of the rest of the body with the exception of white bars that can be seen going across the tail laterally. (see references below) * Range in Mass: 360g to 650g (12.69 to 22.91oz) * Range in Length: 480mm to 600mm (18.90 to 23.62 in) * Range in wingspan: 700mm to 804mm (27.56 in to 31.65 in) * Average Wingspan: 734.8mm (28.93 in) Distribution and habitat They range from southern Mexico through northeastern Guatemala and through most of Central America down through South America as far as Bolivia and southeastern Brazil. Geographic range of the Great Potoo In general the Great Potoo are distributed from humid to semi-humid forested habitats. While this species is widely spreadout geographically, by comparing two subspecies, there is little to no variation in their appearance such as size or plumage. The Great Potoo is found mostly in dense lowland forest, forest edges and clearings. It may also range into foothills (up to about 1,500 m elevation), second-growth, open woodlands (including plantations) and is sometimes seen around meadows, but they always require trees-etc., for their camouflaged imitative perch. In the day they are normally found perching or nesting usually higher than 12 meters above ground level within big trees. The branches they choose to perch usually are nearly 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. At night time, they may go to lower perches like 1.5 meters above the ground, from which they hunt. Behavior This nocturnal predator is usually seen perched high above the ground while foraging, hawking when prey is spotted. After the pounce, the potoo almost always returns to its previous perch. Normally, during the day it perches upright on a tree stump, and is overlooked because it resembles part of the stump; this is a camouflage, not just by coloration, but a camouflage by the setting. The Great Potoo can be located at night by the reflection of light from its eyes as it sits vertical on a post, roost, or angled-tree trunk.Hates people and will attack if gets too close.  Breeding  Breeding has been recorded as typically February to August, but depending on the portion of this bird's range breeding birds can be met with almost year- round.E.g. an attended nest at Tiputini Biodiversity Station, Ecuador, in late December 1999 (Cisneros-Heredia 2006). The nest is a slight depression on a thick tree branch,E.g. Ceiba sp. (Cisneros-Heredia 2006) at least 10 m (33 ft) above ground, with a single white (slightly spotted) egg measuring about 5.2 x 3.8 cm (2 x 1.8 inches). Few details are known of the brooding behavior, but about a month elapses before the offspring is seen alone at the nest. A chick of a few days old weighed .Haverschmidt, F. 1948. Observations on Nyctibius grandis in Surinam. The Auk, 65: 30-33. After about 5 weeks the nestling is a two-thirds version of the adult, but with a lighter build, paler plumage, shorter tail, and smaller bill with less rictal bristles. The fledging period must be at least 2 months. After this time span, the offspring do not return to the nest site. Although the adult potoo likely has few natural predators, predation of eggs, nestlings and fledging is apparently not uncommon. Adults stay near the nest throughout the day and rely upon camouflage to protect their offspring. Predators of great potoo nests in Costa Rica have included monkeys such as mantled howlers, Geoffroy's spider monkeys and white-headed capuchins as well as tayras and collared forest falcons.Young, B., J. Zook. 1999. Nesting of four poorly-known bird species on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. The Wilson Bulletin, 111: 124-128.  Feeding  Their prey consists mostly of large flying insects, especially large beetles, katydids and Orthoptera (including crickets and grasshoppers). Bats and birds are taken occasionally as well. The Great Potoo takes advantage of the night and its natural camouflage by sitting on an exposed perch to wait until some prey flies by, at which point it darts out towards the prey and returns to the branch with it. Very often birds of this species will use the same hunting perch nightly.Cohn-Haft, M. 1999. Family Nyctibiidae (Potoos). Pages 288-301 in J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott, and J. Sargatal (editors), 'Handbook of the birds of the world. Volume 5. Barn-owls to Hummingbirds'. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain. Conservation status Due to its large range, the Great Potoo is seen as a species of least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The Great Potoo is normally described as \\"uncommon\\", but occurs frequently in areas of less disturbed forests and is often found to be rare along the edges of its range. The clearing of forest is the only conservation threat known to this bird.  Effects of Humans on the Great Potoo Population  The local people in the rural area of Brazil sometimes use Potoo as a minor food source, as they do not offer much meat and are hard to locate. In these areas, their feathers are believed to have powers to provide chastity, so they are hunted down for their body parts, which are used to perform ceremonies. It is also believed that parts of their body ward off seduction. Potoos fear most locals due to being hunted.  References  * Borerro, J. 1974. Notes on the structure of upper eyelid of potoos..

Lake Shinji offers an economic benefit to nearby residents in the form of active fisheries and mild tourism opportunities, such as the various hot spring resorts built along the lake's coast and sunset cruises offered by local companies. Lake Shinji is connected to the Sea of Japan via Nakaumi Lagoon, and as a result is made up of brackish water of good quality, which adds to the abundance of aquatic life, such as whitebait, eel, sea bass, and the most famous Lake Shinji delicacy, the Shijimi clam (Corbicula japonica). The Shijimi shellfish is caught using a 'joren', a tool unique to Lake Shinji, which is made up of a basket tethered to a rake. The shellfish is often referred to as one of the 'Shiji-ko Shitchin', the 'Seven Delicacies of Lake Shinji.'

The hoard consisted of 27 silver items and one small gold plaque. Because of inscriptions found on some of the pieces in the collection it has been suggested that they may have been used in a local church, and they therefore comprise the earliest probable group of Christian liturgical silver yet found in the Roman Empire. The hoard was discovered during ploughing in February 1975; several items were damaged by the plough. It was probably buried by an inhabitant of the nearby Roman fortified garrison town of Durobrivae. There are nine silver vessels, and the remainder of the items are votive tokens engraved and embossed with the labarum (the chi-rho cross), mostly of triangular shape. The larger items include jugs, bowls, dishes, a strainer, and an unengraved standing two- handled cup of the form (cantharus) later used as chalices. Due to the importance of this find, it is now in the British Museum, with part of the original hoard having been on display until January 2019 at Peterborough Museum. Major items Decorated silver jug, height 20.3 cm high, 11.6 cm maximum width, weight 534 g. (1975,1002.1). Illustrated above, the jug is the most elaborately decorated largely complete piece in the group, with acanthus- type foliage motifs in several zones, and leaf-scrolls. The single handle has become detached; a fragment was part of the treasure.1975,1002.1 collection database Lower part of a hanging bowl, width 18‚Äì19 cm, weight 220.4 g. (1975,1002.2). Essentially the bottom part only of a large but very thin shallow hanging bowl, designed to be seen from the outside, and possibly used as a lamp. The decoration is repouss√© worked from the outside, leaving the pattern in relief when seen from the inside. Other fragments were found, including rings for suspension and bits of chain, and parts of the rim. There are nine zones of decoration and mouldings. A few very similar bowls have been found in France and Ireland; the decoration may have imitated that of cut glass bowls.1975,1002.2 collection database The piece is now displayed around a perspex support that demonstrates the original full dimensions‚Äîsee the gallery section. Inscribed silver bowl, height 11.5 cm, width 17 cm, weight 663 g. (1975,1002.5). Badly damaged at the base on one side, the bowl has inscriptions: under the base, the name \\"PUBLIANUS\\", and round the rim a regular hexameter line:\\"SANCTUM ALTARE TUUM DOMINE SUBNIXUS HONORO\\" engraved alongside two chi-rho monograms. The exact context of the inscriptions have been debated but \\"O Lord, I Publianus, relying on you, honour your holy altar [or church].\\" is probably the sense. The bowl is therefore marked as a votive offering, and associates the treasure with a church, or perhaps the private chapel of a large house.1975,1002.5 collection database Whilst this is not like other ancient chalices known for Christian worship, it may indeed be the oldest known chalice in existence. Its design is like that of a chalice depicted in the mosaics of the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. Melchizedek and Abel stand making offerings, not to a pagan altar with a fire, but to a table covered with a white cloth. On it are representations of two loaves, and jewelled example of a bowl with handles identical to the Water Newton Chalice. The majority of the objects found are small plaques which were probably fixed to the wall of a church as votive offerings. Some have holes for nails, like the single gold plaque, and one an inscription saying that \\"Anicilla has fulfilled the vow which she promised\\" (1975,10 2.13).Painter and Kent, 32, nos. 37 and 38 The triangular \\"leaf\\" form of most of these was originally pagan, but the chi-rho monogram on these examples makes them the first finds to show that the practice had been adopted by Christians.

In most cases quantum vortices are a type of topological defect exhibited in superfluids and superconductors. The existence of quantum vortices was first predicted by Lars Onsager in 1949 in connection with superfluid helium. Onsager reasoned that quantisation of vorticity is a direct consequence of the existence of a superfluid order parameter as a spatially continuous wavefunction. Onsager also pointed out that quantum vortices describe the circulation of superfluid and conjectured that their excitations are responsible for superfluid phase transitions. These ideas of Onsager were further developed by Richard Feynman in 1955 and in 1957 were applied to describe the magnetic phase diagram of type-II superconductors by Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov.*Abrikosov, A. A. (1957) \\"On the Magnetic properties of superconductors of the second group\\", Sov. Phys. JETP 5:1174‚Äì1182 and Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 32:1442‚Äì1452. In 1935 Fritz London published a very closely related work on magnetic flux quantization in superconductors. London's fluxoid can also be viewed as a quantum vortex. Quantum vortices are observed experimentally in type-II superconductors (the Abrikosov vortex), liquid helium, and atomic gases (see Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate), as well as in photon fields (optical vortex) and exciton-polariton superfluids. In a superfluid, a quantum vortex \\"carries\\" quantized orbital angular momentum, thus allowing the superfluid to rotate; in a superconductor, the vortex carries quantized magnetic flux. The term \\"quantum vortex\\" is also used in the study of few body problems. Under the De Broglie‚ÄìBohm theory, it is possible to derive a \\"velocity field\\" from the wave function. In this context, quantum vortices are zeros on the wave function, around which this velocity field has a solenoidal shape, similar to that of irrotational vortex on potential flows of traditional fluid dynamics Vortex-quantisation in a superfluid In a superfluid, a quantum vortex is a hole with the superfluid circulating around the vortex axis; the inside of the vortex may contain excited particles, air, vacuum, etc. The thickness of the vortex depends on a variety of factors; in liquid helium, the thickness is of the order of a few Angstroms. A superfluid has the special property of having phase, given by the wavefunction, and the velocity of the superfluid is proportional to the gradient of the phase (in the parabolic mass approximation). The circulation around any closed loop in the superfluid is zero if the region enclosed is simply connected. The superfluid is deemed irrotational; however, if the enclosed region actually contains a smaller region with an absence of superfluid, for example a rod through the superfluid or a vortex, then the circulation is: :\\\\oint_{C} \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{l} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m}\\\\oint_{C} abla\\\\phi_v\\\\cdot\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{l} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m}\\\\Delta^{tot}\\\\phi_v, where \\\\hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\\\\pi, m is the mass of the superfluid particle, and \\\\Delta^{tot}\\\\phi_v is the total phase difference around the vortex. Because the wave-function must return to its same value after an integer number of turns around the vortex (similar to what is described in the Bohr model), then \\\\Delta^{tot}\\\\phi_v= 2\\\\pi n, where n is an integer. Thus, the circulation is quantized: :\\\\oint_{C} \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\cdot\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{l} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{2\\\\pi\\\\hbar}{m}n. London's flux quantization in a superconductor A principal property of superconductors is that they expel magnetic fields; this is called the Meissner effect. If the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong it will, in some cases, ‚Äúquench‚Äù the superconductive state by inducing a phase transition. In other cases, however, it will be energetically favorable for the superconductor to form a lattice of quantum vortices, which carry quantized magnetic flux through the superconductor. A superconductor that is capable of supporting vortex lattices is called a type-II superconductor, vortex-quantization in superconductors is general. Over some enclosed area S, the magnetic flux is :\\\\Phi = \\\\iint_S\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}\\\\,d^2x = \\\\oint_{\\\\partial S}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{l}, where \\\\mathbf A is the vector potential of the magnetic induction \\\\mathbf B. Substituting a result of London's equation: \\\\mathbf{j}_s = -\\\\frac{n_se_s^2}{m}\\\\mathbf{A} + \\\\frac{n_se_s\\\\hbar}{m}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\phi, we find (with \\\\mathbf B=\\\\mathrm{curl}\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf A): :\\\\Phi =-\\\\frac{m}{n_s e_s^2}\\\\oint_{\\\\partial S}\\\\mathbf{j}_s\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{l} +\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{e_s}\\\\oint_{\\\\partial S}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\phi\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{l}, where ns, m, and es are, respectively, number density, mass, and charge of the Cooper pairs. If the region, S, is large enough so that \\\\mathbf{j}_s = 0 along \\\\partial S, then :\\\\Phi = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{e_s}\\\\oint_{\\\\partial S}\\\\mathbf{ abla}\\\\phi\\\\cdot d\\\\mathbf{l} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{e_s}\\\\Delta^{tot}\\\\phi = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi\\\\hbar}{e_s}n. The flow of current can cause vortices in a superconductor to move, causing the electric field due to the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction. This leads to energy dissipation and causes the material to display a small amount of electrical resistance while in the superconducting state. Constrained vortices in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets The vortex states in ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material are also important, mainly for information technologyMagnetic vortices in nanodisks reveal information. Phys.org (March 3, 2015). They are exceptional, since in contrast to superfluids or superconducting material one has a more subtle mathematics: instead of the usual equation of the type \\\\operatorname{curl} \\\\ \\\\vec v (x,y,z,t)\\\\propto\\\\vec \\\\Omega (\\\\mathrm r,t)\\\\cdot\\\\delta (x,y), where \\\\vec \\\\Omega (\\\\mathrm r,t) is the vorticity at the spatial and temporal coordinates, and where \\\\delta (x,y) is the Dirac function, one has: ::\\\\operatorname{curl} \\\\, \\\\vec v (x,y,z,t)\\\\propto\\\\vec m_\\\\mathrm{eff} (\\\\mathrm r,t)\\\\cdot\\\\delta(x,y) \\\\ \\\\ (eqn. *), where now at any point and at any time there is the constraint m_x^2(\\\\mathrm r, t)+m_y^2(\\\\mathrm r,t)+m_z^2(\\\\mathrm r,t)\\\\equiv M_0^2. Here M_0 is constant, the constant magnitude of the non-constant magnetization vector \\\\vec m(x,y,z,t). As a consequence the vector \\\\vec m in eqn. (*) has been modified to a more complex entity \\\\vec m_\\\\mathrm{eff}. This leads, among other points, to the following fact: In ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic material a vortex can be moved to generate bits for information storage and recognition, corresponding, e.g., to changes of the quantum number n. But although the magnetization has the usual azimuthal direction, and although one has vorticity quantization as in superfluids, as long as the circular integration lines surround the central axis at far enough perpendicular distance, this apparent vortex magnetization will change with the distance from an azimuthal direction to an upward or downward one, as soon as the vortex center is approached. Thus, for each directional element \\\\mathrm d\\\\varphi \\\\,\\\\mathrm d\\\\vartheta there are now not two, but four bits to be stored by a change of vorticity: The first two bits concern the sense of rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise; the remaining bits three and four concern the polarization of the central singular line, which may be polarized up- or downwards. The change of rotation and/or polarization involves subtle topology.Pylipovskyi, O.V. et al. (January 2015) \\"Polarity Switching in Magnets with Surface Anisotropy. arxiv.org Statistical mechanics of vortex lines As first discussed by Onsager and Feynman, if the temperature in a superfluid or a superconductor is raised, the vortex loops undergo a second- order phase transition. This happens when the configurational entropy overcomes the Boltzmann factor which suppresses the thermal or heat generation of vortex lines. The lines form a condensate. Since the center of the lines, the vortex cores, are normal liquid or normal conductors, respectively, the condensation transforms the superfluid or superconductor into the normal state. The ensembles of vortex lines and their phase transitions can be described efficiently by a gauge theory. Statistical mechanics of point vortices In 1949 Onsager analysed a toy model consisting of a neutral system of point vortices confined to a finite area. He was able to show that, due to the properties of two-dimensional point vortices the bounded area (and consequently, bounded phase space), allows the system to exhibit negative temperatures. Onsager provided the first prediction that some isolated systems can exhibit negative Boltzmann temperature. Onsager's prediction was confirmed experimentally for a system of quantum vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate in 2019. Pair-interactions of quantum vortices In a nonlinear quantum fluid, the dynamics and configurations of the vortex cores can be studied in terms of effective vortex-vortex pair interactions. The effective intervortex potential is predicted to affect quantum phase transitions and giving rise to different few-vortex molecules and many-body vortex patterns. Preliminary experiments in the specific system of exciton-polaritons fluids showed an effective attractive-repulsive intervortex dynamics between two cowinding vortices, whose attractive component can be modulated by the nonlinearity amount in the fluid.  Spontaneous vortices  Quantum vortices can form via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. As a condensate forms by quench cooling, separate protocondensates form with independent phases. As these phase domains merge quantum vortices can be trapped in the emerging condensate order parameter. Spontaneous quantum vortices were observed in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in 2008.

It peaked at #1 on Billboard's \\"Top New Age Albums\\" chart and at #20 on the \\"Billboard 200\\" chart in the same year. Background This was Yanni's first studio album in seven years, an introspective and deeply personal project which came in the wake of a two-year sabbatical, a move to the east coast of the U.S., and other changes which refocused his life and life's work. Critical reception In a review by Zac Johnson of Allmusic, Greek composer/musician Yanni has scaled back his grand musical architecture for If I Could Tell You, a sharp contrast to 1997's grandiose Tribute. The synthesized choral works seem almost sparse and frail, and the elements of world music that have been increasingly injected into his previous works are scaled back as well. Still present, however, are the straightforward melodies and overtly romantic themes that Yanni has been known (and in some cases disliked) for, but these too are less classically inspired and almost atmospheric. Unfortunately, this release may not be sweeping enough for those who fell in love with his romance novel soundtracks, and conversely it doesn't get dreamy enough to attract fans of ambient electronic musicians like Vangelis and Brian Eno. While it is somewhat surprising for Yanni to back away from the richly orchestrated works on Tribute and 1993's In My Time, the move shows a real sense of direction and growth that few give him credit for.

It was created by cartoonist Mike Dawson and humorist Chris Radtke and concerns the various misadventures of a 30-something super-nerd, Christopher Vigliotti, and his friends Ritch Sutton and Vinnie DelPino. They live in the Bronx, New York, in an apartment owned by Christopher's cousin, Lenny Vigliotti.  History  The early years  The comic started out in 2002 as a 24-page mini-comic debuting at the Small Press and Alternative Comics Expo in Columbus, OH, founded by Bob Corby and Dave Sim. Subsequent issues were produced at a rapid pace, and were generally timed to debut at all of the major North American comics festivals along the east coast. Issue #2 debuted at the very first MoCCA Arts Festival, sponsored by the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art and Stella Artois. The double-sized \\"All Action Issue\\" #3 debuted at the annual Small Press Expo in Bethesda, MD at a table shared with the creators of the now-defunct indy comic 23 skidoo.  The floppy years  In 2003 - 2004, Dawson and Radtke self-published issues 4-6 as traditional \\"floppy\\" comics printed at proper-comics-printer Quebecor graphics. Hubris prompted the boys to overprint issue 4, a mistake that they, their wives, and their storage spaces, still regret today. With issues 5 and 6 a more manageable print run was decided upon, and sales were healthy. The floppies were picked up by the comics-distribution monopoly Diamond, as well as by other struggling competitors like Cold-Cut and Shenton 4 Sales. The wilderness years Following issue #6, the series went on an indefinite hiatus. Dawson moved onto a heart-felt graphic memoir about his relationship with legendary glam-rock Queen front-man Freddie Mercury (appropriately entitled Freddie & Me). Radtke has penned a number of different stories, including Everyday (which featured comic strip contributions from an impressive array of mini-comics superstars such as Bob Fingerman, Alex Robinson, Tony Consiglio, Cheese Hasselberger, and Scott Mills).  The comic books   Gabagool! #1 ‚Äì \\"Bounty Hunters\\"  It's the tail-end of the dot com boom, and Christopher Vigliotti is sick of his boring desk job. When he gets home he finds out that his good-for-nothing room-mate Ritch has sold some of his CDs to pay the rent, including one by They Might Be Giants. It is unclear in the story if Chris was a fan of TMBG, but he's mad at Ritch anyway. Following an argument, Chris, Ritch, and their other room-mate Vinnie, decide to become bounty hunters, like Boba Fett, or Robert De Niro in Midnight Run. Their first hunt is to find their friend Doreen's drunk dad, which they do. He was at a bar.  Gabagool! #2 ‚Äì \\"The Meatery\\"  Christopher is sweet on Doreen and tries to impress her at the birthday dinner she invites him and his friends to at a fancy Manhattan Churrascaria. Chris decides the best way to impress the girl is to consume as many different types of meat as possible. The item of meat that he eats that is the funniest to say is \\"pork medallion\\". Meanwhile, Ritch and Vinnie realize that most of the other party guests are homosexual males, and we learn that both Ritch and Vinnie are homophobic. There is also a mentally retarded little girl in the story, who gets upset at Chris when he talks about eating a rabbit.  Gabagool! #3 ‚Äì \\"Rock Soldiers\\"  The bounty hunters are back with their second mission. This time they are hired by New York musician Jed Davis to retrieve a stolen electric guitar that once belonged to Ace Frehley. Christopher agrees to take on the assignment in exchange for a complete Alan Davis run of Excalibur comics. We also learn the origins of their silent friend, Aris ... why is he so silent? Why does he just sit on the couch all day long and do nothing?  Gabagool! #1 ‚Äì Special Edition  After completing \\"Rock Soldiers\\" Mike decided that rather than move on to something new, he'd spend a few months entirely re-drawing Gabagool! #1. Nothing was changed in terms of the main story, but the artwork was nicer throughout. A new three page back-up story called \\"Christopher Vigliotti's Secret Santa\\" was included in this mini-comic. The new story took the place of the ads for urban culture websites, Hentai reviews, and amateur poetry, that had all been featured in the original Gabagool! #1.  Gabagool! #4 ‚Äì \\"Christopher Vigliotti is Laid Off\\" (Hedonism Part 1)  The dot com bubble has burst, and Christopher gets laid off. The good news is that he gets a fat severance. He and his room-mates decide that the best way to spend it would be on a vacation to the seedy Hedonism II resort in Jamaica. Before they leave, Chris undergoes a painful back waxing (a scene that appeared well before a similar more-famous situation in the movie The 40-Year-Old Virgin with Steve Carell closed the book on humorous back-waxing scenarios). This issue includes the back-up story \\"Double Damage\\", which features a young Chris and Ritch with their childhood friends Jimmy Fan and Andrew Yee playing a racy game of Dungeons & Dragons.  Gabagool! #5 ‚Äì \\"Hedo-Dogs\\" (Hedonism Part 2)  Christopher, Ritch and Vinnie arrive in Jamaica and try their best to enjoy their holiday. Christopher is scared to buy marijuana at the airport, so he hides out in a Bob Marley gift shop while Ritch and Vinnie take care of business. They arrive at the resort, and witness a woman performing fellatio on a fat man while at dinner. This issue includes the back-up story \\"The Mad Sh*tter\\", written by Dawson and Radtke, and guest-drawn by mini-comics superstar Tony Consiglio.  Gabagool! #6 ‚Äì \\"Nudes and Prudes\\" (Hedonism Part 3 & The Finale)  The double-sized finale to the \\"Hedonism\\" story ‚Äì 40 pages long with a wrap-around cover. The boys meet a number of different guests at the resort, including a pack of middle-aged swingers. Ritch falls for a beautiful ice-skater, and Vinnie spends all of his time high as a kite on cocaine. An excerpt from an online review: \\"It's not porn. Porn is intended to arouse. It's not erotic, either‚Äîerotic art succeeds in arousing. On the other hand, here's an erection, there's an erection ... here are a whole bunch of breasts ... here's a hideous hot tub orgy! If it's not porn and it's not erotic, what is this stuff?\\" Included in this issue is a pin-up of the Gabagool! characters drawn by mini- comics superstar Alex Robinson, homaging the cover to Marvel Comics classic Avengers #4. Famously, Alex misspells the series title in the pin-up (\\"GABAGOL!\\").  Apocrypha  Some Gabagool! stories have appeared in places besides the six issues of the original series.  \\"The Gabagool! Party Primer\\"  Mini-comic created as a free hand-out at the first official MoCCA Art Festival pre-convention party, hosted by Chris Radtke and the two guys he was currently living with.  \\"Dirty Banana\\"  From the 2003 Small Press Expo anthology, published by the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.  \\"Thecret of the Thword\\"  Short story featuring the Lil' Gabagool! cast first seen in \\"Double Damage\\", was briefly serialized on the webcomics collective Act-i- vate. The story has not yet been publicly completed, and it is not known if the complete work will ever see the light of day.  Inkswell  InkSwell, the fourth documentary from producer/director Jeff Cioletti focuses on the production of the final issue of Gabagool! Features extensive interviews with the creators, as well as appearances by Bob Burden (Flaming Carrot, Mystery Men), Evan Dorkin (Dork, Milk & Cheese), James Kochalka (Monkey vs. Robot), Crazeee Creators, Ben T. Steckler, and the real-life Cousin Lenny.  Controversy  Chris Radtke's has been criticized for his \\"Carny Barker\\" approach to selling Gabagool! comics at conventions.

Boyd spent a lifetime researching and writing on narrow-gauge railways. His books on narrow-gauge railways in North and Mid Wales, the Isle of Man and Ireland are considered to be standard works on the subject. His books, published by The Oakwood Press since 1949, are rarely out of print, reflecting their importance to, and popularity with, railway historians and enthusiasts. Biography Boyd was born in 1921 into a family long connected with the Scottish textile machinery industry. His lifelong work was considerably helped by an inheritance from his family, without which much of his work could not have been done. In his formative years he had W. H. Auden as an English teacher and was taught mathematics and science by Geoffrey Hoyland, a qualified railway engineer, at The Downs School in Colwall. Boyd was an early volunteer on the Talyllyn Railway - the first volunteer-run heritage railway in the world. He organized the first regional working group of volunteers on the Talyllyn. Retiring from the textiles industry in the late 1960s, Boyd moved to Colwall and became a manager at the Downs School. At the same time, he was appointed to look after the Downs Light Railway and started a twenty-year restoration that would ultimately result in his efforts being recognised with a miniature steam locomotive bearing his name. Boyd later retired from the school, but continued to fight to preserve the railway amidst Headmasters who failed to see the historical and educational importance, and led the formation of the Downs Light Railway Trust in 1983. Boyd continued to oversee the railway up to the millennium, despite suffering a stroke in the 1990s. Works    * Isle of Man Railway 1962.

Biography  Born in Palermo, Sicily, Biondi had a late start, having never even held a violin till age 11, but by the following year he had advanced so quickly that he played a concerto with the RAI Symphony Orchestra.Cosic, Miriam (17-18 October 1999). \\"Baroque con brio\\", The Weekend Australian, Review, p. 19 When he was 16, he performed Johann Sebastian Bach's violin concertos at the Musikverein in Vienna. Since then, he has performed with a number of baroque ensembles including La Capella Reial, Musica Antiqua Wien, Seminario Musicale, La Chapelle Royale and Les Musiciens du Louvre. In 1990 Biondi founded Europa Galante, an Italian ensemble specializing in baroque music, that he directs. Biondi's recordings include Antonio Vivaldi's Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione including The Four Seasons and the opera Bajazet, Arcangelo Corelli's concerti grossi, works of Alessandro Scarlatti and George Frideric Handel, from the 18th-century Italian violin repertoire (Antonio Vivaldi, Francesco Maria Veracini, Pietro Locatelli, Giuseppe Tartini), as well as sonatas by Johann Sebastian Bach, Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann. Biondi also performs in duos with keyboard (piano, harpsichord or fortepiano). In 2005 Biondi became artistic director for baroque music of the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra. He plays a 1766 Carlo Ferdinando Gagliano violin lent him by the Salvatore Cicero Foundation in Palermo, an Andrea Guarneri (Cremona, 1686) violin and also a Desiderio Quercetani violin for recording and play.

It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James.

Philip's father has forbidden the match and made his son promise not to see or write to Rose, but Philip has had a telephone installed so that they can talk. FitzStubbs senior hopes to marry Rose's mother. Mrs. Frumpington, a spiritualist, is worried that her late husband may disapprove of her marrying FitzStubbs. Visiting her daughter's house, she is alone in a room and hears a voice evidently talking to her.

Recording and release Repetition was recorded in January 1996 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington and produced by Steve Fisk and John Goodmanson. The band sought a more \\"studio-oriented\\" approach than their previous albums and experimented new sounds with keyboards. The word \\"Repetition\\" was chosen as the album's title because, according to singer and guitarist Justin Trosper, \\"I like that word. It sort of describes a lot of things. People have said that our music is repetitious. So I thought it would be funny if we called out record that. Plus it's our fifth record, so we're like repeating things over and over\\". Repetition was released on April 9, 1996 by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars, which also released the band's previous three albums. The song \\"Corpse Pose\\" was released as a single on March 11, 1996, featuring an outtake, \\"Everything Is Weird\\", as the B-side. Critical reception The album received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Blake Butler described Repetition as the band's \\"most sleek and mood-encompassing album.\\" Megan McCarthy of CMJ New Music Monthly opined that the album features \\"a sound that is polished and paced, tethering its bass-driven ferocity to tingling melodies\\", but also admitted that some songs such as \\"Fingernails on a Chalkboard\\" are too repetitious. Matt Ashare, writing for Boston Phoenix, stated that Repetition \\"mixes in a dub-heavy instrumental reminiscent of early PiL ('Sensible'), a high-pitched feedback frenzy buoyed by a stark funk backbeat ('Fingernails on a Chalkboard') that recalls Gang of Four's 'Anthrax', elegant Tom Verlaine-style guitar lines, and skronk punctuated by synth noise that harks back to the heyday of Captain Beefheart ('Corpse Pose'). The likes of Rancid and Green Day pale in comparison to the challenge of Unwound: this is the real punk rock.\\" The album has been hailed as a masterpiece among those in the punk rock scene.

Overview  After the Union of Transylvania with Romania of 1 December 1918, the University of Upper Dacia was organised at Cluj, ultimately being renamed King Ferdinand I University. It was officially opened on 1 February 1920 in the presence of King Ferdinand I and of the royal family. Representatives of the Allies of World War I and of countries neutral during the First World War were also present. The following year, the Italian state made a gift to Romania of five copies of the Capitoline Wolf. One copy was sent to Bucharest, to the Pia»õa RomanƒÉ, a second one to Cluj, a third to Chi»ôinƒÉu, a fourth to Timi»ôoara and a fifth to T√¢rgu Mure»ô; they symbolised the unity of Romanians from all parts of the country and their Latinity. The Cluj-Napoca monument, brought to Cluj by a delegation of 200 Italians, mostly students, is a faithful copy of the Capitoline Wolf, with Romulus and Remus beneath her. To it was added a bas-relief of Emperor Trajan, executed by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, along with the inscription Alla citta di Cluj, Roma Madre, MCMXXI (\\"To the City of Cluj, Mother Rome, 1921\\"). It was decided to place the monument in Unirii Square, in front of the Statue of Matthias Corvinus. The first Romanian mayor of Cluj, Iulian Pop, unveiled the monument on 28 September 1921 in the presence of over 25,000 residents. After the Second Vienna Award in 1940, a significant part of Cluj's Romanian population was forced to leave the city; the statue too was taken away to safety. After World War II, the statue was brought back to Cluj, but the prevailing political climate did not permit the statue to be put back in its original location, so it was placed in front of the University, where it remained until 1973, when the statue was again placed in Unirii Square. A group of statues of members of the Transylvanian School was set up in its place in front of the university. In 1994 the statue was removed from its location at the intersection of Eroilor Boulevard and Unirii Square and replaced with the Memorandum Signers' Monument, erected in honour of the men who signed the Transylvanian Memorandum and had the strength to stand up to the de-nationalisation measures against Romanians being undertaken by the Austro-Hungarian government. The dedication of the monument took place exactly 100 years after the memorandum signers were sent to prison. The Statue of the She-Wolf was moved to the Transylvanian History Museum, where it was restored by the sculptor Liviu Mocan, later being placed in the middle of Eroilor Boulevard.

One of the highest lights in California, it was constructed in 1855 to warn ships approaching San Francisco from the west away from the rocky islands. In later years it was shorn of its lantern, but it remains in use. History Farallon Island Light was constructed on Southeast Farallon Island. After the tower was complete, it proved too small to house a first- order Fresnel lens, and the tower had to be torn down and rebuilt. The lighthouse was lit for the first time in December 1855. In 1939, the United States Coast Guard took over the lighthouse when the United States Lighthouse Service merged with it. The Coast Guard maintained a presence until 1972. By that time, the lantern room and the Fresnel lens had been removed, and an automated aero beacon was placed on the tower. The lens is on display in the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park visitor center on Hyde Street, while the lantern room itself was scrapped after removal. From Coast Guard web site: > This lighthouse is situated on the highest peak of the southeast Farallon. > It was built in 1855 in the busy days which followed the gold rush when > clipper ships and other sailing vessels were sailing in to San Francisco in > large numbers.

Emmet Spiceland hold a special place in Irish music history as the first of their kind, bringing what was, at the time, a modern sound, to the previously stiff and conservative national airwaves. They were known for beautiful harmonies, pin-up good looks, Mod style and previously unheard of contemporary arrangements of Irish classics. History In the mid-sixties, both folk groups were enjoying their own successes. The Emmet Folk Group, including Mick Moloney, came in second in the 1966 Wexford Ballad Contest, losing out to The Johnstons. Meanwhile, The Spicelanders were a popular attraction in folk clubs in Dublin. The two had already been billed in concerts together, and when Moloney left for The Johnstons, the two groups merged in 1967. The band enjoyed screaming Beatlemania-style scenes at public appearances after a number of chart successes, with the single \\"Mary from Dungloe\\" hitting number one. The single was taken from their album, The First featuring songs by Shay Healy and Christy Moore, with orchestral arrangements by Phil Coulter. (Christy Moore praised the band in a documentary of his life, accompanied by footage of a performance at the All Ireland final at Croke Park in Dublin.) The band's management employed marketing and poster campaigns said to be ahead of their time, with band members in glamorous settings not common to the day. The success of their song \\"Mary from Dungloe\\" inspired the creation of the Mary From Dungloe International Festival which is still going strong today. In July 2017, they reformed for one evening only, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Mary from Dungloe festival. Aftermath Brian Byrne went on to further fame in London's West End with Jesus Christ Superstar and Joseph, amongst other successes. Michael's interests took him toward the visual arts, following up an unfulfilled desire to attend art school in his teens. D√≥nal Lunny moved on to now-legendary projects such as Planxty, The Bothy Band and Moving Hearts. He's produced, played and arranged for the likes of Kate Bush, Paul Brady, Elvis Costello, Rod Stewart, Indigo Girls, Clannad, The Waterboys, and Baaba Maal. Family Michael and Brian Byrne are from a family of musical and performing talent; their father, Tommy Byrne won the Feis Ceoil three years in a row in the 1930s. He was a celebrated Irish famous boy soprano at the age of thirteen and trod the boards of such intimidating venues as the much loved Dublin Theatre Royal and Irish radio. In 1967, Michael and Brian Byrne had won the Wexford Ballad Contest, in which Emmet Spiceland had taken second place the year before. Relations Clannad have credited the brothers' success with inspiring their interest in performing.

Early Polynesian jewellery, which was made of bone, wood and other natural materials, has not survived. The precise start of island jewellery-making is difficult to pinpoint, due to many of the island nations' founders migrating there from other areas, such as Tahiti. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist. Headdresses, necklaces, hair pins and arm and waist belts are the most common pieces amongst island cultures. Types and social meanings The styles and types of jewellery in the Pacific changes greatly from island to island, as does the purpose of wearing it. As in most cultures, jewellery in the Pacific is worn to symbolise the wearer's power, whether it be wealth or victory in battle. Jewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either power, but in many cases across the Pacific, jewellery is worn to show fertility. As a prime example, the hei-tiki of the New Zealand MƒÅori is said to be a sign of fertility. However, many historians suggest that the carved necklace has connections with Tiki, the first MƒÅori, who also has strong ties with the symbolism of fertility. Historians also speculate that the reason the tiki is worn is that the Tiki is a product of the ancient belief of a god named Tiki. This supreme being is known to be ancient and not solely localised to the MƒÅori, and is thought to date back to before the MƒÅoris even settled in New Zealand.Hiroa, T.R. 1974. The Coming of the Maori, Wellington: Whitcombe and Tombs Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy in battle. The wearing of headdresses is particularly common in Papua New Guinea, where there are often many different types of headdress for different occasions. These headdresses are usually made out of vegetation, but designs often include birds of paradise feathers, including the highly sought- after King of Saxony feathers. The power associated with the headdresses in Papua New Guinea is phenomenal, perhaps stirred by the amount of work and craftsmanship that has gone into make such a feathered display. Like the Papua New Guineans, New Zealand MƒÅori wore feathered headdresses too to symbolize power. The now extinct huia feather was highly prized, with chiefs wearing white-tipped huia feathers to symbolise power over chiefs wearing monotone feathers. Huia feathers were revered as \\"taonga\\" or treasures by MƒÅori and in later times, the European settlers. The huia feathers were often grouped in twos and were usually accompanied by a kiwi feather cloak, an ear piercing and commonly a small jade club. After Western colonisation, European woman began wearing the feathers to express their strong social standing. A modern opal bracelet from Australia Pacific jewellery has now lost much of its former strong cultural meaning. Most Pacific jewellery now is created for the sole purpose of commercial and tourist profits. Indeed, some pieces of jewellery have become major symbols of the Pacific's lifestyle to tourists, such as leis in Hawaii, which are now commonly associated with that area and its laid back, tourist-friendly attitude. Another example is the previously mentioned New Zealand tiki, which is generally one of the more purchased jewellery types from the country. Australia is notable for its large deposits of opals, with the country being the number one supplier of opals in the world. The richest source is at Lightning RidgeDorling Kindersley Ltd. 1989. Facts and Fallacies: Stories of the Strange and Unusual. Reader's Digest. 11-13. Religion In some regions of the Pacific, jewellery is still very much untouched by outside influences, and therefore very primal. Testaments to this are parts of Borneo and Papua New Guinea, which are still unexplored by Westerners. Tribesmen may wear boar bones through their noses, very much like the typical tribal clich√© people outside these cultures use. Much of the islands' tribal designs were lost due to the introduction of outside religions via the flood of Western missionaries that entered the area. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity. Now, most traditional jewellery is created for tourists or under a newly found respect for the tribal designs. Indeed, many island nations are now rekindling the art of traditional jewellery making in an attempt to salvage lost designs or techniques. After the mass conversion to other religions, Pacific jewellery eventually adopted religious symbols in their jewellery designs. For example, many designs incorporated Christian symbols such as the cross. Traditional pieces of island jewellery were occasionally made for religious purposes. Many pieces were created for tribal ceremonies, tattoo rituals and marriage. In fact, use of jewellery for religious functions in the Pacific was as common as in any other culture. Pieces were often handed down from generation to generation, further escalating the importance of the jewellery. Design was key in Pacific pieces: even simple shapes such as a background square could have a complicated meaning when placed with other symbols. Historians have conceded that this level of design is often lacking in other cultures.Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment. David Bateman & Auckland Museum. Examples Restored moai with pukao (headdress) on Easter Island Many examples of Pacific jewellery exist. As with the rest of the world, every Polynesian culture had at least one form of body adornment. Even the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island, a small island over 2,000 miles from any land mass, had jewellery. Examples of their jewellery can be found on the giant moai they left behind, some of which wear pukao headdresses. It is thought that the moai with these adornments depicted individuals of higher social standing, because in other cultures, people who could afford jewellery were considered wealthier and more important in ancient times. One of the most recognisable pieces of jewellery tied to a culture is the Hawaiian lei. This floral necklace is given out when an outsider arrives, and thus is used widely as a commercial icon for travellers who visit the islands. Special candy leis have also been introduced for children's birthday parties. Some nations are still less industrialized than other larger nations, for example, the island nation of Samoa. Although a haven for tourists, the country is still well below the poverty line and thus, jewellery that is not for commercial use, is still quite primitive. Craftsmen from the area still use natural materials to create their jewellery, and the way in which they go about making the jewellery is also often based on ancestral designs. Shells, bone, coconut and wood are all used in Samoan jewellery. Coir is often used in place of string. Throughout the Pacific, some jewellery pieces are more common than others. For example, necklaces, earrings and headdresses of different sorts are all very common items used by Polynesians to adorn themselves. Some pieces, such as the wearing of masks, are only apparent in certain areas, such as Micronesia and with the aborigines of Australia. Breast plates were worn by the MƒÅori, as well as many other small islands in the Pacific. Belts and adornments hung off them, are mainly situated around Papua New Guinea and its neighbours, while nose piercings are also found in that area. Overall, although jewellery pieces in the Pacific are very similar amongst the island nations, they are also varied greatly and each piece represents the wearer's beliefs, ancestry and nation to the observer.

The firm exported to many countries including Australia and South America. By 1880 Lysaghts was exporting enough corrugated iron to Australia to establish a central selling agency in Melbourne.An Australian Icon Lysaght Utilizing this demand, John Lysaght set up Victoria Galvanised Iron and Wire Company in order to get around import restrictions. In 1897 the company publication, the Lysaght Referee, detailed the products Lysaghts sold. The original Lysaght brand of corrugated iron was Orb, followed in 1897 by a cheaper version of Redcliffe. Both brands were exported in large quantities to Australia. Globe was a brand produced for American and African markets but some quantities ended up in Australia. Lysaghts manufactured galvanised sheet and plate between 1880 and 1912 at the Eskbank steelworks in Lithgow. The brand was Crown and it appears these sheets were not corrugated for roofing. In 1918 John Lysaght (Australia) Pty Ltd was incorporated with the head office transferred from Melbourne to Sydney.

He spent parts of the next three seasons bouncing back and forth between the Pirates and Triple-A, and then was traded to the Chicago Cubs for Darren Lewis on July 31, 2002. Lewis chose to retire rather than report to the Pirates, so the teams made a follow-up trade involving minor league players Aron Weston, Ricardo Palma, and Tim Lavery two weeks later. Hermansen spent the remainder of the season with the Cubs, and then was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 4.

The company was acquired by GKN in 1920. The founder John Lysaght (1832-1895) was born in Mallow, County Cork, Ireland, into a prosperous family of landowners; his father was William Lysaght (1800-1840), a distant relation of the Lisle baronets. John Lysaght was sent to school in Bristol, and became friendly with the Clark family. In the 1851 census he is recorded as a civil engineer living with his widowed mother and family in Liscard, Cheshire.1851 census record However, in 1856 he acquired from the Clark family a small hardware galvanisation business, utilising the Crawford hot-dip technique, at Temple Back, Bristol. Forlorn Britain: The Orb Steelworks, Newport . Retrieved 15 November 2013 The business was renamed John Lysaght Ltd., and initially employed six men and a boy. Lysaght expanded the business, buying in iron sheets and galvanising them for the expanding factory market. He adopted the name \\"Orb\\" as his trademark, and Orb corrugated galvanised iron sheeting became highly prized. Demand grew quickly, and in 1869 Lysaght purchased a larger site at St Vincent's, Netham, Bristol, for a new factory which by 1878 employed 400 men and produced 1000 tons of galvanised iron sheet a month. The company also diversified into making constructional ironwork, exported around the world from Bristol. In 1878 the company bought the disused Swan Garden Iron Works in Wolverhampton, and two years later acquired the neighbouring Osier Beds Iron Works. Together these enabled Lysaght's to produce 40,000 tons of rolled iron sheet each year, much of which was exported to Australia. John Lysaght travelled to Australia in 1879, and formed a subsidiary company there, Lysaght (Australia), the Victoria Galvanised Iron and Wire Co. In England, John Lysaght's was incorporated as a limited company in 1881, and then expanded at its bases in Bristol and Wolverhampton. Expansion John Lysaght's nephews, Sidney Royse Lysaght (1856-1941) and William Royse Lysaght (1859-1945), both joined the company in the late 1870s. W.R. Lysaght oversaw the company's expansion, while S.R. Lysaght turned to writing novels and verse. Shortly before its founder's death in 1895, the company acquired land at Pill Farm, Newport, South Wales, on which to build a new rolling mill. The Orb Ironworks at Newport opened in 1898, and by 1901 most of the machinery at Wolverhampton, and many of the employees, had transferred to Newport. For many years copies of the Wolverhampton Express & Star were delivered regularly to newsagents in Newport, and the works football team formed the basis of what became Newport County AFC. Under W.R. Lysaght, the works had 3,000 employees, including 600 women, and produced 175,000 tons per year, mostly for export. Daniel Connor Lysaght (1869-1940) became the works manager and led the company's expansion into electrical steels through a partnership with the Joseph Sankey Company. In 1912, the company ended its reliance on bought-in steel by opening its first steelworks, Normanby Iron Works, at Normanby Park, Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire. Its weekly output of 6,500 tons was shipped to Newport for rolling. By 1913, the Newport ironworks had 42 mills, driven by six steam engines, and the works' chimneys were a major landmark. The number of blast furnaces at Scunthorpe increased to four in 1917. History of John Lysaght Ltd.. Retrieved 19 November 2013 Merger and later developments Iron platform canopy of Hounslow Central. There is still a plaque showing the maker's mark near the platform stairs. In 1919, the Lysaght family members sold most of their shares in the company to its chairman, Seymour Barry, while remaining in control of various branches of the business. The company acquired a controlling interest in Joseph Sankey and Sons Ltd.. In 1920, Guest Keen and Nettlefolds (GKN) acquired the John Lysaght company, including its works at Newport, Bristol, and Scunthorpe. Seymour Berry, chairman of John Lysaght, and another director, then joined the board of GKN. In 1921 the company established an Australian subsidiary in Newcastle, New South Wales, and many of the Newport workers emigrated there to start up the new mills. Using the Lysaghts name, new works were also acquired or built in Argentina and Canada. The name John Lysaght remained in use by GKN as late as 1966, for its works at Newport and Scunthorpe. The platform canopy of Hounslow Central London Underground station is one example of original John Lysaght work. W.R. Lysaght Institute The restored Lysaght Institute in Newport At Newport, where employment at the Orb steel works peaked at over 3,500 employees, the W.R. Lysaght Institute was opened in December 1928 on Corporation Road, as a memorial to its namesake's fifty years as the company's chairman, and to celebrate the contribution of its employees to the success of the works. It was financed jointly by the company and its workers, stood in 8 acres of grounds near the works entrance, and provided a range of facilities for staff including a ballroom, tennis courts, bowling green, and ornamental gardens. It closed in 2001, and soon became derelict. The site was initially purchased by a housing developer, but was later sold and in 2008 was bought by Linc- Cymru.History of Lysaght Institute .

After visiting the Soviet Union in 1927 as a trade union activist, she joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1928. Later, married and living in Moscow, she quickly became disillusioned with communism. When her Russian husband, Arcadi Berdichevsky, was arrested in 1936, she escaped to England with her young son. (Her husband would die in 1938.) In 1939, the rest of her family moved to the United States, where she became a leading anticommunist author and activist.Professor D. A. Farnie, Freda Utley, Crusader for Truth and Freedom, which is excerpt from Chapter 30 on Freda Utley in Britain and Japan, Biographical Portraits, editor, Hugh Cortazzi, Volume 4, London, Japan Society, 2002, 361‚Äì371. She became an American citizen in 1950. Early life and work Utley's father was involved with George Bernard Shaw, the Fabians, and labour struggles before becoming an attorney, journalist and businessman He was introduced to her mother by Edward Aveling, Karl Marx's translator and longtime partner of his daughter, Eleanor. In her memoirs, Utley describes her early influences as \\"liberal, socialist and free-thinking, strongly colored by the poetry of revolt and liberty and legends, stories and romances of heroism and adventure.\\"Freda Utley, 'Odyssey of a Liberal: Memoirs, Washington National Press, Inc., (1970), Chapter 1 and 2. Utley was educated at a boarding school in Switzerland, after which she returned to her native England to earn a B.A. degree followed by an M.A. degree in history (with first class honours) at King's College London. The UK General Strike of 1926 and what she calls the \\"betrayal\\" of the workers by the British Trade Union Council and the Labour Party made her more favourable to communism. After visiting Russia as the vice-president of the University Labour Federation in 1927, she joined the British Communist Party in 1928.Freda Utley, Odyssey of a Liberal: Memoirs, Chapter 5. Utley writes about her conversion: \\"It was a passion for the emancipation of mankind, not the blueprint of a planned society nor any mystical yearning to merge myself in a fellowship absolving me of personal responsibility, which both led me into the Communist fold, and caused me to leave it as soon as I learned that it meant submission to the most total tyranny which mankind has ever experienced.\\" From 1926 to 1928, she was a research fellow at the London School of Economics. During this period she focused on labour and production issues in manufacturing, in her case, the textile industries of Lancashire, then beginning to face competition from operators in India and Japan. In 1928, she married Russian economist Arcadi Berdichevsky who had been working in England for Arcos, the Soviet trade mission.Georgie Anne Geyer, Son Solves Mystery of Father's Death in Soviet Gulag, Uexpress.Com, 24 September 2007.Francis Beckett, How the son of a British communist became a leading Washington conservative, The Guardian 4 November 2005. After a visit to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Communist International sent Berdichevsky and Freda Utley on missions to Siberia, China and Japan, where she lived for nine months. In 1931, she published her first book, Lancashire and the Far East which established her as an authority on the subject of international competition in the cotton trades. Upon her return to Moscow with her husband, she became disillusioned with the system's inability to provide decent medical care or housing as well as the corrupt, hierarchical Communist Party system.Freda Utley, The Dream We Lost: The Soviet Union Then and Now, John Day Company, New York (1940), Chapters 3 and 4. Living in Moscow from 1930 to 1936, she worked as a translator, editor and a senior scientific worker at the Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and Politics. During this time she also wrote, from a Marxist perspective, Japan's Feet of Clay, an expos√© of the Japanese textile industries that also attacked western support for Japanese imperialism. The book was an international bestseller, translated into five languages, and solidified her credentials in communist circles. On 14 April 1936, Soviet police arrested her husband, then the head of an import/export government group. Unable to aid him, she left soon after for England with her young son Jon, using British names and passports. There, she mobilized important leftist friends like Shaw, RussellRoyden Harrison, Bertrand Russell and the Webbs: An Interview, from \\"Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies 5,\\" issue 1 (1985), article 6, 48. and Harold Laski to try to find Arcadi and even sent a letter directly to Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.Jon Basil Utley, About Freda Utley, Atlas Foundation . She received two postcards from Arcadi reporting his five years' sentence to an Arctic Circle concentration camp for alleged association with Trotskyists. (She herself had flirted with Trotskyism.Martin Upham, The History of British Trotskyism to 1949, Part One, (1929‚Äì1938), Thesis submitted for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the University of Hull, 1980.) In 1956, she learned he had died on 30 March 1938. It would not be until 2004 that her son Jon Basil Utley would learn from the Russian government the details of his death by firing squad for leading a hunger strike at the Vorkuta prison labour camp.Jon Basil Utley, Vorkuta to Perm: Russia's Concentration-Camp Museums and My Father's Story , Foundation for Economic Education, July 2005. He was \\"rehabilitated\\" posthumously in 1961 under post-Stalin rehabilitation laws. In 1938, Utley published two books on Japan's military attacks on China at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). Japan's Gamble in China, with an introduction by Laski, described Japan as \\"a police state, governed by a bureaucracy wedded to a plutocracy.\\" The News Chronicle made her a war correspondent and she spent three months in China in 1938, making two trips to the front line. Her 1939 book China at War idealized the Chinese communists. The work aroused considerable popular sympathy for China and helped foment poor relations with Japan prior to World War II.William L. O'Neill, A Democracy at War: America's Fight At Home and Abroad in World War II, p 57 Her goal was to make for herself an international reputation and prove her communist credentials to free her husband. Author Francis Beckett includes a chapter on Utley's ordeals in his 2004 book Stalin's British Victims.Stalin's British Victims, Sutton Publishing Ltd, London, 2004. Anticommunism Utley and her son and mother moved to the United States in 1939. Believing Arcadi to be dead, she expressed, in the 1940s, her disgust with communism and the Soviet Union in her book The Dream We Lost, later published as Lost Illusions. Bertrand Russell wrote the introduction: \\"I knew Freda Utley first when she was in the process of becoming a Communist; I continued to know her through the stages of her disenchantment, the tragedy of her husband's arrest, and the despair induced by the failure of all her efforts to procure his release.\\" Utley described her work as emanating from \\"the only Western writer who had known Russia both from inside and from below, sharing some of the hardships and all the fears of the forcibly silenced Russian people.\\" In a review, author Pearl Buck wrote: \\"It is a strongly unassailable indictment of Russian Communism. It is a strongly dramatic story and one interesting enough to make a major novel, the story of a brilliant mind, rigorously truthful in its working....\\" Communist publishers and intelligentsia in both Britain and the US tried to discredit Utley. In the posthumously published book Reagan, In His Own Hand: The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America, Ronald Reagan's speechwriter wrote about Utley that \\"many of the intellectuals didn't want to hear what she had to say. She had impressive academic credentials when she came to the U.S. but publishers and the academy closed doors against her. She understood all too well. She had tried communism and learned its falseness. She said only those 'who have never fully committed themselves to the communist cause' can continue to believe in it.\\"Ronald Reagan and Annelise Anderson (authors), Martin Anderson (editor), Reagan, In His Own Hand: The Writings of Ronald Reagan That Reveal His Revolutionary Vision for America, Free Press, 6 February 2001. In 1940, Guido Baracchi, a scholar, communist and labor advocate, revealed a letter Utley had written to a friend in 1938: > I have not pretended to be a Stalinist but have kept my mouth shut about > Russia until now. Naturally I have no illusions left‚Äînor had any before they > took Arcadi. I am not a Trotskyist as I have become convinced that all > dictatorships are much the same and that power corrupts everyone. Without > democracy there can be no real socialism. But I fear the world is > progressing towards 'National Socialism' on the Russian-German model. Little > difference between them.\\"Murder Will Out, An open letter to members of the > Communist Party, Guido Baracchi, 1940 on Marxist.Org. In 1945, Reader's Digest sent Freda Utley to China as a correspondent. The trip resulted in Last Chance in China, which held that Western policies, especially cutting off armaments to the Chinese Nationalists, favored the Chinese Communist Party victory. She began a crusade to name those who \\"lost China\\". In 1948, Readers Digest posted Utley to (Germany), resulting in Utley's next book, The High Cost of Vengeance which criticizes as war crimes Allied occupation policies, including the expulsion of millions of Germans from European nations after World War II and the Morgenthau plan. She also accused the United States of torture of German captives, the Allied use of slave labourNote: she notes \\"Asked before leaving Germany on September 25, 1948, whether the transfer of German workers to slave labour in Russia is in contravention of the laws established at Nuremberg, General Taylor said that the evidence concerning this was only 'lay' evidence and that Russia's action ought, in any case, to be considered 'in relation to the existing situation'.\\" in France and the Soviet Union and criticized the Nuremberg Trials legal processes.She noted for instance that at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials (held after the first set of Nuremberg Trials) \\"American rules of evidence are not to be applied by the judges. Hearsay and double hearsay evidence is permitted, and it is left entirely to the discretion of the judges whether or not the defense be permitted to question the authenticity or probative value of evidence.\\" Utley's book was excoriated by The New York Times but was according to her own publisher praised by Reinhold Niebuhr in The Nation magazine.Henry S. Regnery, Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher , Regnery Gateway Inc., Lake Bluff, Ill., 1985; Review of Freda Utley's The High Cost of. Vengeance (PDF), Manas Journal, Volume II, No. 51, 21 December 1949. The last of her studies of the Far East, The China Story, was published in 1951 and was a best seller for several months. Time magazine called Utley \\"a seasoned, firsthand observer of China events.\\"The Mistake of the Century, Time magazine, 21 May 1951. Following the Suez Canal Crisis of 1956, Utley spent six months in the Middle East and published her last book on international affairs Will the Middle East Go West? In it, she warned that America's support of Israel would drive the Arab countries into the waiting arms of the communists. In 1970, Utley published the first volume of her autobiography Odyssey of a Liberal which recorded her early experiences in Fabian Society circles, education, marriage, life in the Soviet Union and travels up until 1945. She never published the second volume. Upon her death in 1978, Time Magazine published an obituary of Utley.Time Magazine obituary. The New York Times mentioned a gathering of leading conservatives to pay tribute to Utley ten years after her death.David Binder, Washington Talk: Briefing; Conservatives Gather, The New York Times, 13 September 1988. In 2005, her son, Jon Utley, endowed the Freda Utley Prize for Advancing Liberty, administered by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation. Ten thousand dollars a year is bestowed upon overseas think tanks that promote economic liberalism and minimal government. Controversies Freda Utley's bestseller Japan's Feet of Clay was criticized for factual inaccuracies and an exaggerated negative view of the Japanese people and a misinterpretion of the class system. The Japanese government held her responsible for the initiation of an American boycott of Japanese goods and banned the book and Utley from Japan.Alfred Rosner, Review of Ygael Gluckstein Stalin's Satellites in Europe, International Socialism, Issue 103, 5 July 2004.E. Herbert Norman, Japan's Emergence As a Modern State, UBC Press, 1940, 43. Nevertheless, Stanford University keeps \\"Freda Utley collection's coverage of sociopolitical conditions in interwar Japan and the Sino-Japanese conflict\\" in its Japanese collection.Stanford University Japanese Collection . During the late 1930s and 1940s, Utley supported the 1938 Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler because she thought the Soviet Union was more dangerous than Hitler and doubted the US and Britain could defeat the German war machine.Justus D. Doenecke, Storm on the Horizon: The Challenge to American Intervention, 1939‚Äì1941, Rowman & Littlefield, published 2000, 254. Also, she asserted that most of the people in the Sudetenland wanted to be part of Germany instead of Czechoslovakia, as also asserted by Nazi Germany. Once in America, she sympathized with the antiwar America First Committee. In 1941, she reached a mass Reader's Digest audience calling for a negotiated peace between (Germany) and Britain. She also opposed the demand for Germany's unconditional surrender. Knowing her views were rooted in opposition to the Soviet Union, the Friends of the Soviet Union tried for four years to have her deported. Finally, in 1944, Representative Jerry Voorhis passed a private bill for \\"the relief of Freda Utley\\" from the 1940 Alien Registration Act. Victims of the Allied bombing of Dresden. Utley's criticisms of Allied policies in her book The High Cost of Vengeance from 1949 included charges of \\"crimes against humanity\\":The Nuremberg court defined \\"Crimes Against Humanity\\" as \\"murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated\\" Other statements like: \\"There [is] no crime that the Nazis committed that we or our allies did not also commit ourselves\\"Holocaust denial: Historical view , Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies site. caused controversy. Utley wrote in The High Cost of Vengeance: \\"I had referred to our obliteration bombing, the mass expropriation and expulsion from their homes of twelve million Germans on account of their race; the starving of the Germans during the first years of the occupation; the use of prisoners as slave labourers; the Russian concentration camps, and the looting perpetrated by Americans as well as Russians.\\"\\"Freda Utley, The High cost of Vengeance, Chapter 7 \\"Our Crimes Against Humanity\\" In her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, the American historian Deborah Lipstadt critically examines the dissemination and impact of such arguments by Utley and other \\"revisionists,\\" claiming that \\"the argument that the United States committed atrocities as great, if not greater, than those committed by Germany has become a fulcrum of contemporary Holocaust denial.\\" In the 1950s, Utley helped Senator Joseph McCarthy compile his lists of highly placed people suspected of communist sympathies. She gave evidence against China expert Owen Lattimore to the Tydings Committee and evidence against alleged \\"fellow travelers\\" (communist sympathizers) like Asian scholar J. K. Fairbank and Red Star Over China author Edgar Snow to other congressional committees.Sam Tanehause, Un- American Activities, Review of Arthur Herman's book Joseph McCarthy: Reexamining the Life and Legacy of America's Most Hated Senator, New York Review of Books, Volume 47, Number 19, 30 November 2000.Thomas, S.

He married Thelma Mae Robertson Griffith, niece and adopted daughter of Washington owner Clark Griffith, in October 1941, ten months after he had been traded to Chicago by his future father-in-law. Born in Lincolnton, Georgia, Haynes' pro career began in 1937. He stood tall and weighed . In 379 games pitched, including 147 games started, Haynes compiled a 76‚Äì82 win-loss record, 53 complete games, five shutouts, 159 games finished and 21 saves in 1,581 innings pitched.

Modern lexicographers have proposed an unattested Old South Arabian etymon for the plural tawƒÅrƒ´kh, \\"datings\\", from the Semitic root for \\"moon, month\\". The Ge'ez term tƒÅrƒ´k, \\"era, history, chronicle\\", has occasionally been proposed as the root of the Arabic term, but in fact is derived from it. The word first appears in the titles of certain 8th-century works and by the 9th century it was the standard word of the genre of these works. The word akhbƒÅr, \\"reports, narratives\\", is a synonym and was also used in the titles of works. It may even be an older word than ta ærƒ´kh. The word ta ærƒ´kh was never universal in the titles of works of history, which were just as often identified by subject matter (i.e., biography, conquests, etc.) as by genre. As its etymology implies, ta ærƒ´kh originally described only a strictly chronological account, but it soon came to refer to any kind of history (e.g. historical dictionaries).

The Harold Gilliam Award for Excellence in Environmental Reporting, given by The Bay Institute, is named in his honor. Early life and education Gilliam was born in Los Angeles and earned a bachelor's degree in political science from UCLA and a master's in economics from UC Berkeley; he later studied under Wallace Stegner at the Stanford Writing Program. He served in the 11th Armored Division in Europe in World War II. Career Gilliam began his career in journalism as a copy boy at the Chronicle, where he was soon made a reporter. In 1954 he became a freelancer, then in 1960 began an environmental column at the Examiner; the following year he returned to the Chronicle, where he continued his column, called \\"This Land\\", until retiring in 1995. San Francisco Bay, his first book, was on The New York Times bestseller list for 19 weeks. It led to his being invited to be a founder member of Save the Bay. Gilliam was one of the first environmentalist journalists, and helped mobilize public opinion to save many features of the San Francisco Bay Area. In the 1960s, through an article and personal contacts, he helped achieve a Marin County ordinance forestalling the bulldozing of archaeological sites. His article \\"The Destruction of Mono Lake Is on Schedule\\", which appeared in the Examiner in March 1979, was one of the first public accounts of the then ongoing destruction of Mono Lake; in 1993 he was the first recipient of the Defender of the Trust award from the Mono Lake Committee. The Bay Institute named its Harold Gilliam Award in his honor. The group also gave him its Bay Education Award in 1995. Personal life Gilliam was married to Ann, with whom he co-wrote a book on Carmel, California; she died in 2001. They had one son. Gilliam died in San Francisco in 2016 at the age of 98.

Solar shingles, also called photovoltaic shingles, are solar panels designed to look like and function as conventional roofing materials, such as asphalt shingle or slate, while also producing electricity. Solar shingles are a type of solar energy solution known as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). There are several varieties of solar shingles, including shingle-sized solid panels that take the place of a number of conventional shingles in a strip, semi-rigid designs containing several silicon solar cells that are sized more like conventional shingles, and newer systems using various thin-film solar cell technologies that match conventional shingles both in size and flexibility. There are also products using a more traditional number of silicon solar cells per panel reaching as much as 100 watts DC rating per shingle. Solar shingles are manufactured by several companies but the three main manufacturers of solar roof shingles are RGS Energy, SolarCity, and CertainTeed.List of Solar Roof Shingle Manufacturers. Other active companies in the US include SunTegra Solar Roof Systems, and Atlantis Energy Systems (asphalt and slate systems). History Solar shingles became commercially available in 2005. In a 2009 interview with Reuters, a spokesperson for the Dow Chemical Company estimated that their entry into the solar shingle market would generate $5 billion in revenue by 2015 and $10 billion by 2020. Dow solar shingles, known as the POWERHOUSE Solar System, first became available in Colorado, in October 2011. The POWERHOUSE Solar System continues to live on in its 3rd generation iteration, and has exclusively been licensed to RGS Energy for commercialization. In October 2016, Tesla entered the solar shingle space in a joint venture with SolarCity. Description Solar shingles are photovoltaic modules, capturing sunlight and transforming it into electricity. Most solar shingles are and can be stapled directly to the roofing cloth. When applied they have a strip of exposed surface. Different models of shingles have different mounting requirements. Some can be applied directly onto roofing felt intermixed with regular asphalt shingles while others may need special installation. Some early manufacturers used solar thin-film technologies, such as CIGS to produce electricity, which are less common in the solar industry than silicon-based cells. Current manufacturers, such as RGS Energy, CertainTeed, and SunTegra, have chosen to use the industry-standard monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar cells in their POWERHOUSE 3.0, Apollo II, and SunTegra Shingle, respectively. The installation methods for some solar shingle solutions can be easier than traditional panel installations because they avoid the need to locate rafters and install with a process much more similar to asphalt shingles than standard solar panels. Solar shingled roofs tend to have a deep, dark, purplish-blue or black color, and therefore look similar to other roofs in most situations. Tesla Solar has developed shingles in several styles to better match traditional roofs. Homeowners may prefer solar shingles because large panels can be highly visible and spoil the aesthetics of the house. Coming in 2018 Tesla will offer shingles in slate and Tuscan styles, these are the first of the solar shingles which look the same as a slate or Tuscan style roof but still provide solar power. They also have been \\"Test video for the highest (class 4) hail rating, filmed at 2,500 frames per second. Each 2\\" hailstone is travelling 100 mph on impact.\\" which shows how these new options are also safer in disasters than tradition materials. Cost The cost of solar shingles can range from $3.80 per watt up to $9.00 per watt installed depending on the manufacturer, technology used, and system size. As of May 2019, the average cost of a traditional, roof-mounted residential solar panel installation in the United States was just above $3.00 per watt, according to the Solar Energy Industry Association. Linked from https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-soft-costs. $3.05/watt was quoted for 2019 by energysage.com While solar shingles are typically more expensive to install than traditional solar panels, some companies in recent years since 2014 have made strides to lessen the gap between the installed cost of going solar with panels versus going solar with shingles. According to Dow Chemical Company reports, a typical residential install consisting of 350 solar shingles can cost at least $20,000; however, federal and state incentives depending on the location might significantly bring down the cost. Solar contractors typically offer homeowners a full-service price for solar installation, which includes equipment purchasing, permit preparation and filing, registration with the local utility company, workmanship warranties, and complete on-site installation. Because photovoltaic solutions produce power in the form of direct current (DC) and the standard in homes is alternating current (AC), all grid-connected solar installations include an inverter to convert DC to AC. Availability As of 2015, companies offering solar shingles in the United States included CertainTeed, Forward Inc., SunTegra Solar Roof Systems, and Atlantis Energy Systems (asphalt and slate systems). In January 2018, Tesla announced, after testing on employees' roofs, that it would begin installing the Tesla Solar Roof on commercial customers' homes \\"within the next few months\\".Eckhouse, Brian. \\"Tesla's New York Gigafactory Kicks Off Solar Roof Production\\", Bloomberg.com, January 9, 2018 RGS Energy announced in October 2017 that they will be offering the third generation POWERHOUSE modules in 2018 after obtaining UL Certification.

The lighthouse is at the south end of the narrowest part of Golden Gate strait. It was preceded by two other lighthouses in nearby locations. The present lighthouse was in operation from 1864 until 1934. Structures There have been three lighthouses built in the area where Fort Point stands today. The original lighthouse, built in 1853, was a Cape Cod style lighthouse with an integral tower. It was the second lighthouse to be built on the US west coast, but it stood for only three months, and was never lit. While awaiting the arrival of its lens (from Paris), it was torn down to make room for the Army fort. The second lighthouse at Fort Point was a squat wooden tower with four sides that sloped up to a square watch room. It was built on the narrow ledge between the fort and the water. In 1855, the light behind its fourth-order Fresnel lens was lit for the first time. Erosion undermined its foundation, and in 1863 it was torn down to make way for a bigger seawall. Fort Point's third lighthouse was built atop the wall of the fort in 1864. It was built as a iron skeleton tower with a spiral staircase. A fifth-order lens was originally fitted, but in 1902 the lens was upgraded to a fourth-order lens, which produced alternating white and red flashes. In 1933, when work on the Golden Gate Bridge began, a fog signal and navigational light were placed at the base of the bridge's south tower. On September 1, 1934, after the towers for the Golden Gate Bridge were completed, the lighthouse was deactivated. The bridge would block off much of the light from the lighthouse, and as the towers were tall, they provided a more visible warning for mariners.

History U.S. Coast Guard Archive The brick structure for the Lime Point Lighthouse was built in 1883 as a fog- bell signaling station. It was eventually fitted with coal powered 12-inch steam whistles. During operation, the facility included the fog signal building, a coal shed, water tank, and a two-story keeper's quarters. The keepers building later upgraded to include a third floor. In 1900, a lens lantern was hung on the south-east corner of the fog signal building, at a height of 20 feet above the water. In 1902, the coal-powered steam horn was modified to use crude oil to reduce operating costs and smoke pollution. Lime Point Lighthouse continued to operate after the completion of the Golden Gate Bridge since it remained an effective position for a light and fog horn, even though Fort Point Light, at the South end of the bridge was decommissioned.

He created many albums from HMV, Concorde Records, Sagarika, during his long career (1957‚Äî1999) with his instrumental renditions of Indian Hindi film songs, Classical based songs, Ghazals of prominent composers like Mehdi Hassan, Ghulam Ali, Jagjit Singh, Bade Ghulam Ali, Bengali film songs and modern songs, Nazrulgeeti, Rabindrasangeet (Songs of Tagore) and popularised the Hawaiian guitar in India. His renditions often had subtle twists and turns that made it even more melodious than the original song. At his peak, there used to be two LPs, released during the yearly Puja celebration, by HMV; one containing songs by Lata Mangeshkar, and the other having instrumentals by Sunil Ganguly.The Gramophone Company of India (HMV) Records Listing The instrumental film hits he recorded were hits with the youth, in Bengal as well as all over India. Sunil Ganguly was a very busy artist in his heyday, and did many public performances all over India, including Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, Guwahati, Agartala etc. He did one-man whole night shows in Mumbai, played in reputed College fests like the IITs, Regional Engineering Colleges. He had a big group of musicians accompanying him on his performances, and recreating the songs, and some of the best musicians of the era, like Sri Y S Mulki, Sri Dilip Roy, Sri Samir Khasnabis, Sri Swapan Sen, Sri Manohari Singh accompanied him on his recordings and performances. A sample of the kind of atmosphere he created with his renditions can be found here. He was a regular performer at Doordarshan programs (TV) in Kolkata and Mumbai, AIR (All India Radio), Radio Ceylon (Sri Lanka). His radio programs were popular and were listened to by many all over India and abroad, and this program continues to this date, over the internet. He inspired an entire young generation to listen and play Indian music on the Hawaiian guitar. He had many number of successful students, who are continuing his style of playing songs and in turn are coaching students in India and abroad.  Life and career  Ganguly was born at Sonamura village in Tripura on 1 January 1938. He moved with his parents to Kolkata in his childhood. He had a fondness for the Hawaiian guitar from a very early age. At this time his uncle used to take him to various music programs in Kolkata. It was his uncle who bought him a guitar. However, he did not know where to learn this. He used to visit Sri Sujit Nath, one of the fathers of Hawaiian guitar music in Kolkata, at the time. But he used to sit quietly at his classes, not having the money to pay the fees for taking lessons. He has mentioned in his last interview, he got lot of love and affection from Sri Sujit Nath, though he never learnt from him in class. At the insistence of his relatives he participated in All India Youth Guitar competition which was quite well known at the time, and came first, to his own amazement, by playing 'Kya karoon Sajani, Aye na Balam'. Present at the competition was Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. He was so impressed by the rendition, he went up on the stage and embraced Sunil Ganguly and expressed his amazement at how such a song could be rendered on the Guitar. He then recommended Sunil Ganguly's name to All India Radio / Akashvani with a letter, and this is how Sunil Ganguly started playing on radio.as narrated by Sunil Ganguly himself to his prominent student Sri Aloke Ghosh At this time he trained in Western music under Oscar Jones, a reputed teacher in Calcutta at that time. But this could not satisfy him. He was fond of Indian classical music, and used to attend the music conferences. Many a times he could not afford to buy a ticket, and hence used to listen from the pavements outside. He later trained under the sitarist Pt. Ajoy Sinha Roy,http://www.itcsra.org/TreasurePast.aspx?TreasuresId=4 who himself was a direct disciple of Baba Alauddin Khan. Ganguly, therefore, had a profound knowledge of North Indian Classical music. He developed a style of playing Classical Raga-based dhuns and gats on the Hawaiian guitar, which was his own unique style. He was the first to bring in the 'gayaki' style of playing which was non-existent at the time, and this led to the huge popularity of the instrumentals he rendered on the Hawaiian guitar, be it classical based film songs, ghazals, Tagore songs, Nazrul songs, or other popular songs. He played a wide variety of songs in his career, including Hindi film songs, rare songs of Lata Mangeshkar, Ghazals, by Jagjit Singh, Mehdi Hassan, Ghulam Ali, Bengali film songs, Tagore songs, Nazrulgeeti, Bengali songs of prominent composers like Satinath Mukhopadhyay, Shyamal Mitra, Hemanta Mukherjee, Bihu songs in Assamese language His recording career spanned more than 40 years from 1957, when he cut his first album from HMV. The famous Bengali singer and composer of that era, Sri Satinath Mukhopadhyay played a major role in introducing Sunil Ganguly to HMV. The incident goes : Satinath babu listened Ganguly's rendition of his composition 'Koto nishi gechhe nidhara' sung by Lata Mangeshkar, on Akashbani (radio) and being amazed, called upon Ganguly and inquired how he got to learn this song. Ganguly replied : he did not learn from anybody, it was his own rendition by listening to the song. Satinath babu immediately recognized his talent and decided to introduce Sunil Ganguly to HMV for cutting his first album. That was the beginning and Ganguly did not have to look back after that.Interview to 'Bartaman' Some of his remarkable records include 'Ghazal chedi usne' - an album of instrumentals of ghazals by prominent singers such as Mehdi Hassan, Jagjit Singh, Ghulam Ali,'Ibteda' - an album of compositions by Jagjit Singh,'The Classic Touch','Sentimental Journey','The Golden Collection - All Time Greats, Vol I and II','Swinging hits','More hits','Magic Melody','Instrumental Film Hits','Sunil Ganguly (the name of the album used to be his name)','The Singing Guitar' - with Kazi Anirudha, 'Encore - Electric Guitar','Renaissance - Tunes of Kazi Nazrul Islam on the guitar (the first album he did on Kazi Nazrul Islam songs)' , 'Khelicho E Biswa Loye - Nazrulgeeti tunes', 'Surer Jharna - instrumental of Bengali hits', 'Tribute to Hemanta Mukherjee - Hemanta Mukherjee songs' etc. Towards the later part of his career, Sunil Ganguly made a few beautiful albums from Concorde records and Sagarika Co. (For ex: 'Ei Sundor Swarnali Sondhay - Bengali hits like 'Jibon Khatar prati patay', 'Bhora thak Smritisudhay -Tagore songs' from Sagarika, 'Instrumental Film Hits - containing hits from Betaab, Agar Tum na Hote' from Concord. HMV and other Cos, released some of his best instrumentals in the form of CD, for ex: 'Nostalgia : Ghazal Chedi Usne, Great Ghazals on guitar', 'Nostalgia : Melodies to caress your Heart 'N' Soul', 'Tumi Rabe Nirobe', 'Instrumentally Yours - Tribute to Manna Dey', 'The Best of Bollywood Instrumentals Ever'from HMV (now Saregama Ltd), 'Yaadein' (containing hits of Kishore Kumar and Md. Rafi), 'Golden greats from Yesteryears' from Sagarika. HMV (Saregama Ltd) has released many of this instrumentals on YouTube, and many of his instrumentals are available for purchase on Saregama site. His instrumentals are available on HMV India(Saregama), Amazon, saavn.com, gaana.com iTunes store, and YouTube. He was active in giving music classes at his residence, and in doing recordings, until the last day. He took music classes at several institutions in Kolkata like BaniChakra (South Kolkata), Technique Studio (North Kolkata), in addition to the ones at his residence in Garia. Students used to come from far away places to his residence classes, including places like Asansol, Durgapur, Odisha, Tripura. He was revered by his students, and was a strict disciplinarian. His way of teaching was very methodical, using Indian notation system (originally created by Rabindranath Tagore, and used in all his works). He made many number of compositions and dhuns based on various Ragas, and he used these to train his students for number of years before they were allowed to play a song. Ganguly also had a sharp background of Western music, including chords. He was very fond of the Spanish guitar and chords. Whenever he used to teach a song to his students, it used to be complete with interlude music, chords, and some of these interludes (for ex: the sitar piece in the song 'Hum hai mataye koochao Bazaar ki Tarah'or the chords in the song \\"Pal Pal Dil ke Paas\\") were quite intricate and high in complexity.The notations that he created for his large number of classical Raaga based dhuns, and the songs he played, were very detailed, and intricate. Within one beat, meends with as many as 5 or 7 notes were common. Students had to practice classical Raaga based dhuns and gats for quite a few years before playing a song. There was no excuse of less practice in his classes, and there was no way to advance to a next lesson before getting the current lesson right with the tabla and to his satisfaction. Unless he was satisfied about the total presentation he would not go to a more complex piece. Special mention must be made here about his accompanist on the Tabla : Sri Jasodadulal Mukherjee, who accompanied him in class and recordings for a long 30+ yrs. Mr Mukjerjee, has groomed many students, by playing the tabla with them, and guiding them with the finer nuances of Rhythm cycle, and is continuing to do so, having a very detailed knowledge of the dhuns composed by Sri Sunil Ganguly. During his recordings, Sunil Ganguly created notations for every accompanying musician before playing a song. There has been instances when, in a music program at Guwahati, he has been requested a popular song for which he was unprepared. He quickly created notations of the song and played it with perfection. He did not encourage performing in the media at any time. According to him, the guitar is to be played like a prayer, to derive true happiness. He was an ardent follower of Swami Vivekananda till his last day. Sunil Ganguly had many disciples, many of whom took the guitar as a profession. The music classes based on his way of teaching are kept going by the creation of Sunil Ganguly Academy of Music, at his residence, run by Sri Aloke Ghosh, one of his disciples. Apart from this many of his students like Smt Sonali Nath, Smt Geeta Deb, Sri Shyamal Chowdhury, Sri Amarnath Banik at Agartala, Tripura are continuing to play and teach his style of music to this date. Each year on 1 January his students assemble at his residence in Garia and pay tributes to this legendary guitarist till today. Remembering Sunil Ganguly on his birthday 1 January 2018.

J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Synopsis In a charming rural 17th century setting, near a stream and rustic bridge, Piscator arrives, looking forward to a quiet day's fishing. He is interrupted by Amandus, who wants to commit suicide by drowning himself in the river. Piscator, upset, tells Amandus that he has, throughout his life, tried to catch a particular carp at this place. If Amandus throws himself in, he will chase away the carp and spoil a lifetime of work. Amandus, in turn, tells Piscator of his hopeless love affair. He promises to wait until after 6 PM, when Piscator must return home, before drowning himself. Amanda arrives, and she wants to commit suicide in the river, also over a hopeless love affair. Piscator tells her she must wait, and then goes up the bank, where he has seen the carp nibble at his line. Amanda tells Amandus about her plan to throw herself into the river, but Amandus notes that he has already claimed the pool for that purpose. Amandus's love is Clorinda, Amanda's dearest friend. Amanda then gives Amandus information that casts Clorinda in a bad light. She also shows Amandus that Clorinda has given a very unflattering profile of Amandus in a letter that Clorinda wrote to Amanda. As the two continue to converse, Amanda finds out that her love, Corydon, is Amandus's best friend. Amandus reveals, however, that Corydon had paid off a gambling debt to Amandus by giving him Amanda's ring. He also relates some rather unflattering things that Corydon had told him about Amanda. Soon, the two are no longer enamoured of their former loves and are now in love with each other. By the time Piscator returns, neither of them wishes to commit suicide any more.

MacGregor started his career with home town club Greenock Morton at the age of 14, before moving to Stranraer in 2011, and finishing his career with Queen's Park. Playing career Morton Born in Greenock, MacGregor progressed through Greenock Morton's youth ranks to become a dependable first team player. He was a product of the Peter Weir youth side; a side that ran Celtic so close in the Scottish Youth Cup semi-final at Parkhead in 1999. David's progress was rapid and as a result he made his first team debut in season 1999/00 at 18 years old. It could be argued that his progress was somewhat accelerated by Morton's mismanagement by then owner and chairman Hugh Scott. MacGregor started out as a midfielder but also proved his versatility when he easily adapted to play at right back. However his career took a significant turn for the worse in 2001. Towards the end of the 2000/01 season Hugh Scott put Morton into administration. As a result of ongoing cash flow problems administrator Graham Martin was forced to release all of Morton's first team players. Unfortunately MacGregor was one of them. After chairman Douglas Rae stepped in to save the club from folding the team advertised for players to come for trials. MacGregor appeared at these trials and subsequently re-signed for the club. 2001‚Äì02 was his first season back at Cappielow. However this ended in relegation from the Scottish Second Division. The next season was much better as Morton won the Scottish Third Division Championship. The joy of a winners medal was not as sweet as it should have been for MacGregor. The reason being that in the 5th from last game of the season he suffered a broken leg and was ruled out of the game for a year. MacGregor was Morton's longest serving player having played for the club for 11 years. During that period his dedication was rewarded by chairman Douglas Rae when he gave David a three- year contract extension (when he was out injured) in 2003. He established himself as a defender in the squad. He is first and foremost a centre-back but he, more often than not, played at left back for Jim McInally, even though he is predominantly right footed. At the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, MacGregor required a hernia operation after the away game in April against St Johnstone. He was out after this operation he was out for approximately six months before making his return to the first team against Clyde in Morton's first win of the season on 18 October 2008. When MacGregor came back into the side in October 2008, he was played in the right back berth, which earlier in the season was filled by Alex Walker. Despite being injured for most of the 2008‚Äì09 season, MacGregor was given a contract extension by Davie Irons until August 2009 to prove his fitness ahead of the next season. After receiving the extension, which was until 15 August 2009, MacGregor managed to regain the ability to run in June 2009 ahead of the season to give him hope of gaining a contract extension for the rest of the season. On 17 August, MacGregor signed a new one-year deal to take him until the end of 2009‚Äì10 season. As with the end of the previous season, at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season MacGregor was again injured. He was offered the summer to prove his fitness, to see if he merited a contract extension under new manager Allan Moore. Once again he received a further year on 19 July 2010. Stranraer MacGregor was released by Morton in May 2011, and signed with Stranraer after playing in a couple of trial matches. After playing in seven league matches, MacGregor was signed until the end of the season. In June 2012, MacGregor signed another extension for a further season at Stair Park. Queen's Park On 27 June 2014, MacGregor signed for Scottish League Two club Queen's Park. On 28 July 2015, he left Queen's Park, the club agreeing to release him due to work commitments.

It was originally released on the Eagles' album Hotel California on December 8, 1976. It was subsequently released as the B-side of \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\" single on May 3, 1977. In a 1978 interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said: \\"'The Last Resort', on Hotel California, is still one of my favorite songs... That's because I care more about the environment than about writing songs about drugs or love affairs or excesses of any kind. The gist of the song was that when we find something good, we destroy it by our presence ‚Äî by the very fact that man is the only animal on earth that is capable of destroying his environment. The environment is the reason I got into politics: to try to do something about what I saw as the complete destruction of most of the resources that we have left. We have mortgaged our future for gain and greed.\\" Andy Greene. \\"Readers Poll: The Ten Best Eagles Songs.\\" Rolling Stone, July 29, 2015. Composition On an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard (which devoted an entire episode to the making of Hotel California), Frey stated: > I have to give all the credit for 'The Last Resort' to (Don) Henley. It was > the first time that Don, on his own, took it upon himself to write an epic > story. We were very much at that time, concerned about the environment and > doing anti-nuclear benefit (concerts). It seemed the perfect way to wrap up > all of the different topics we had explored on the Hotel California album. > Don found himself as a lyricist with that song, kind of outdid > himself...We're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of > the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. > I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. There's enough crap > floating around the planet that we can't even use so it just seems to be our > way. It's unfortunate but that is sort of what happens. Frey referred to the song as \\"Henley's opus.\\" Henley recalled that he had been reading about \\"the raping and pillaging of the West by mining, timber, oil and cattle interests\\" at the time he wrote the song. He said that he wanted to expand the song's scope even further, and so he \\"tried to go 'Michener' with it,\\" but was never totally satisfied with how it came out. Recording The band recorded \\"The Last Resort\\" at the Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. However, Black Sabbath was also recording Technical Ecstasy in an adjacent studio and played very loudly. The Eagles had to re-record the song a number of times due to the noise coming through the wall from the next studio. Critical reception Music critic Dave Thompson considers it an update of Joni Mitchell's \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" but says that it is \\"even more weary and despairing.\\" Thompson regards the line \\"Some rich men came and raped the land. Nobody caught ‚Äòem\\" to be a critique of a free market economy. Critic William Ruhlmann said of it that it \\"sketches a broad, pessimistic history of America that borders on nihilism.\\" Author James Perone says that it ties \\"all the previous songs [from Hotel California] together in this final reflection of the dark side of California Life.\\" He notes, for example, how the song lyrics contrast the beauty of the California desert with ugly suburban houses and ultimately progresses to criticize the concept of manifest destiny, on which American expansion to California was partially based. He regards the key lyric to be the line \\"They called it paradise; I don't know why,\\" noting the emphasis given to it by the resignation of Henley's voice and by the falling melody. Perone does criticize the use of synthesizer on the song instead of actual string instruments, which he feels sounds artificial. To Eagles' biographer Marc Eliot, \\"The Last Resort\\" tells \\"the story of a nation's self- destruction and physical decay told as metaphor for personal creative burnout.\\" In 2016, the editors of Rolling Stone rated \\"The Last Resort\\" as the Eagles #27 greatest song.

He has worked his way from making short films only aired on Italian television to become a well-known and successful American filmmaker. He is the elder brother of actor Silvio Muccino, who often appears in his brother's films. Muccino has directed 10 films and is best known for his first American film The Pursuit of Happyness, starring Will Smith. Muccino has been nominated for and won several awards including the David di Donatello Award for Best Director in 2001 for his film The Last Kiss. Life and career Born in Rome, Gabriele Muccino started his studies at Sapienza University of Rome in Italian literature but dropped out of University to pursue a career as a director.http://biografieonline.it/biografia.htm?BioID=1672&biografia;=Silvio+Muccino Muccino gained success with films such as L'ultimo bacio (One Last Kiss) and Remember Me, My Love (Ricordati di me). His first on-set film experience was as a volunteer director's assistant. This inspired his passion for filmmaking and led him to take courses in screenwriting and enroll in a directing program at Rome's Experimental Cinematography Institute. While there, Muccino created a few short films that were aired on Italian television. He then began directing a number of documentaries. Following these accomplishments, Muccino was given the opportunity to direct a segment of the Italian film, Intolerance (1996). . \\"Come te nessumo mai\\" (But Forever in My Mind) was the next film he directed, starring his younger brother Silvio. Muccino's third feature film, \\"L'ultimo bacio\\" (The Last Kiss), directed in 2001, was the breakthrough that brought him international attention. The film's success led to Muccino signing a two-picture deal with Miramax. His success continued to grow with his next film, \\"Ricordati di me\\" (Remember Me, My Love) in 2003. He has currently made the switch to directing Hollywood films after L'ultimo bacio won the Audience Award for World Cinema at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival bringing him to the attention of the American film industry. Muccino was personally chosen by Will Smith to serve as the director of The Pursuit of Happyness. Muccino said in an interview afterwards, \\"Will had to defend me as a choice to the studio; I could barely speak English and could barely express my vision. I felt protected and that I could push my ideas even when they weren't totally conventional. The reason I found respect, and respect for my ideas, was because of Will.\\" Muccino also directed Smith's later film, Seven Pounds. Playing for Keeps was his next major work, starring a very well-known celebrity cast featuring Gerard Butler, Dennis Quaid and Uma Thurman. Muccino's next film Fathers and Daughters also features A-list celebrities such as Amanda Seyfried, Russell Crowe, and Aaron Paul. His latest film, Summertime, is a coming of age story of two Italian teenagers traveling to the States for the first time during the summer between high school and college. Awards and nominations Muccino has won several awards throughout his lifetime. The first being Best Film at the Torino International Festival of Young Cinema in 1998 for Ecco fatto (That's It). In 1999 his film, Come te nessuno mai, won him several awards including the Silver Iris at the Brussels International Film Festival for best film, the Golden Castle at the Castellinaria International Festival of Young Cinema, and the OCIC Award at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema. The Italian box office success L'ultimo bacio won Muccino Best Director and Best Screenplay at the David di Donatello Awards. This film also earned the Audience Award in 2002 at the Sundance Festival which introduced Muccino to the United States. Ricordati di me scored three Nastro d'Argento Prizes which are the Italian equivalent to the Oscars.

History The original tower was built in 1890 at the entrance of Oakland Harbor. The wooden pilings on which the structure sat had deteriorated by 1902, and a larger replacement lighthouse was constructed on concrete pilings nearby, which began operation in 1903. The original structure was then sold and removed. In 1966, the lighthouse was replaced by an automated beacon and deactivated. It was eventually sold to a private party and relocated to Embarcadero Cove in Oakland, where it opened in 1984 as Quinn's Lighthouse Restaurant. The lantern room was removed after deactivation in 1966, and was transferred to Mark Abbott Memorial Lighthouse in Santa Cruz, California, where it continued to deteriorate and was replaced in 1996.

History Mare Island Light was built in 1873, deactivated in 1917, and demolished in the 1930s. The lighthouse was designed by Paul J. Pelz, who also designed Mare Island's sister stations, Point Fermin Light in San Pedro CA, East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California, Point Hueneme Light in California (replaced in 1940), Hereford Inlet Light in North Wildwood, New Jersey, and Point Adams Light in Washington State (burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912), all in essentially the same style. The United States Lighthouse Board later realized that a light positioned offshore near the junction of the strait and river would better serve navigation in the area. The Carquinez Strait Light opened in 1909 to replace this light in purpose, but in an offshore location, between the two channels. A Navy Direction Finding Station was later erected on the site in 1942. It was manned by U.S. Navy radiomen stationed at Naval Radio Station, Mare Island. The station was closed in 1945 after World War II ended and a Navy Radio Beacon was installed.

AdventHealth Ocala is located at 1500 SW 1st Ave, Ocala, Florida. The medical center provides emergency care, medical services, heart and vascular center, stroke center services, home health care, and pediatrics. The healthcare facility is owned by the Marion County Hospital District, and has been leased to AdventHealth since 2018. The hospital district is largely funded by the US$213 million paid to the district by Community Health Systems in 2014 for the right to operate this facility. CHS sold their lease to AdventHealth in 2018.  History  The hospital was founded in 1898 as Marion General Hospital. The impetus for building a local hospital was a man being run over by a horse and wagon. The initial location was a three-story building owned by the publisher of the local newspaper, the Star‚ÄìBanner, which was lent to the new hospital until 1901. The hospital operated in makeshift housing until 1915 when additional land was acquired for the hospital to expand. A three-story hospital building was constructed and was able to treat up to 50 patients in an emergency. In 1927, local residents approved a bond issue to build expanded four-story building that could handle 73 patients. It was built on the same site and is still in use today as the northernmost building of the hospital. In 1928, the hospital was renamed to Munroe Memorial Hospital in honor of community leader T.T. Munroe, a local banker, who gathered community support and led the push to expand the hospital. The hospital has undergone extensive expansion over the years. By the early 1960s, the hospital had grown to 130 beds. In 1980, the hospital was again renamed to Munroe Regional Medical Center. The hospital expanded to 323 beds in 1994 and 421 beds in 2003.(Munroe Regional Medical Center, 2018) On August 1, 2018, the hospital was renamed Florida Hospital Ocala. The hospital was renamed to AdventHealth Ocala in January 2019 when Adventist Health System rebranded to AdventHealth.

Life Born in Damascus, during the reign of atabeg Toghtekin, Ibn Asakir received an extensive education, as befitting someone from a wealthy family. By 1120, he was attending lectures of al-Sulami at the Shafi'i madrasa, which was built by atabeg Gumushtegin. He traveled to Baghdad, following the death of his father, and went on hajj in 1127. He returned to Baghdad to hear lectures at the Nezamiyeh, from Abu l'Hasan al-Ansari (a pupil of al-Ghazali), lectures on the hadith of Abi Salih al-Karamani and Ibn al-Husayn Abu 'l-Kasim. By 1132, Ibn Asakir had returned to Damascus and married that year. Civil disturbances forced him to leave Damascus and travel from Isfahan to Merv, where he met Abu Sa'd 'Abd al-Karim al-Samani. With al-Samani he travel to Nishapur and Herat and by 1139 he had passed through Baghdad on his way back to Damascus. Throughout his journey he collected numerous hadiths and had become a hafiz. Under the patronage of Nur ad-Din Zangi, Ibn Asakir wrote the Tarikh Dimashq. In 1170, Nur al-Din built the madrasa Dar al-Hadith for Ibn Asakir.Carole Hillenbrand, The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives, (Routledge, 2000), 127.

That is not limited to the assessment of narrators of hadith, Ilm ar-Rijal, but also includes historical and political figures. When it comes to Islamic figures, Ibn Asakir tried to collect everything that has been said about that figure, true or false, with full chain of narration.

Until 1984, Faleolo could not accommodate jets larger than a Boeing 737. Services to the United States, Australia, or New Zealand, could only land at Pago Pago International Airport in American Samoa. Since the airport's expansion most international traffic now uses Faleolo. Until 31 December 2019 small turboprop aircraft used to connect American Samoa and Samoa from Fagali'i Airport in the eastern suburbs of Apia. With the closure of Fagali‚Äôi Airport, all aircraft now use Faleolo.  History   Faleolo Airfield  The site and location of the current airport was originally known as Faleolo Airfield. It was constructed by the United States Navy SeaBees of 1st Construction Battalion after war broke out in the Pacific in 1942. It became an auxiliary field of U.S. Naval Station Tutuila in the Samoa Defense Group Area during the Pacific War. Faleolo Airfield was completed by the Seabees in July 1942 and U.S. Marine Fighting Squadron VMF-111 was moved from Tafuna Airfield to Faleolo Airfield after the aircraft runway was completed to protect the islands of Upolu and Savai'i from an anticipated Japanese invasion. The original runway was x and was extended to x in March 1943 to accommodate a taxiway and space for basing of up to 57 fighter aircraft. Airfield support buildings and two hangars were also constructed and completed in March 1943. Until 1984, Faleolo could not accommodate jets larger than a Boeing 737. Services to the United States, Australia, or New Zealand, could only land at Pago Pago International Airport in American Samoa. Since the airport's expansion, the Airport now caters for most international traffic arriving from New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, Hawaii and USA.  Facilities  The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 08/26 with an asphalt surface measuring . The Pavement Classification Number for the runway is 058FBXT. Faleolo Tower has some jurisdiction over the airspace of American Samoa and Tonga as well as its own airspace. It is assisted by the tower at Nadi, Fiji and the whole area is under Oceanic Control from Auckland, New Zealand.  Airlines and destinations   Accidents and incidents  *On 13 January 1970, Polynesian Airlines Flight 308B, operated by Douglas C-47B 5W-FAC crashed into the sea shortly after take-off on an international non-scheduled passenger flight to Pago Pago International Airport, American Samoa. All 32 people on board were killed. *In 2000, Air New Zealand flight NZ60 nearly overshot the runway due to a faulty instrument landing system, which had been accidentally damaged by a digger. The pilots took a number of measures to successfully prevent an accident, which were incorporated into a training video. Key points from the video that averted disaster included the pilots' unease about the ILS glideslope capture, the conflict between the aircraft's altitude and the functioning Distance Measuring Equipment, and their familiarity with the approach into Faleolo which caused them to realise they were not where they were supposed to be, had the ILS been functioning correctly. For these reasons they initiated a go around, and used the VOR/DME equipment for the second and successful approach.

The larva is usually either a gusano rojo (\\"red worm\\") or a chinicuil (\\"maguey worm\\"), the caterpillar of the Comadia redtenbacheri moth. The red worm is typically considered tastier. Contrary to popular belief, a true tequila does not contain a worm. It is only in mezcal, a closely related beverage. History Although the custom is relatively recent, larvae are used frequently by several brands of mezcal to give flavor to the drink. A whole larva is deposited in the bottle, normally after having previously been cured in pure alcohol. Nacional Vinicola (NAVISA) was the first company to add a worm to its Gusano Rojo mezcal. Andres Paniagua and Jacobo Lozano, creators of Gusano Rojo and Dos Gusanos, first introduced the practice of adding larva to mezcal. Today, several brands are doing this including Patron. Other kinds of worms The other variety of \\"worm\\" in mezcal is the larva of a weevil known as picudo del agave, Scyphophorus acupunctatus, the agave snout weevil, that infests certain species of yucca and maguey. They are not related to edible maguey worms (which are, in reality, a species each of moth or butterfly larvae) of central Mexico. The weevil is a pest that can severely damage agave plants, by eating the plant to death from the inside. If only a few infest the plant, they can still carry and infect the plant with harmful bacteria leading to plant death. In some cases, up to 40% of a maguey harvest has been lost to weevil infestations. Infection-resistant varieties of the plant are being developed. Picudo larvae may be roasted and eaten; they are a seasonal specialty of markets in southeastern Mexico.

William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington (167819 April 1743), was an English Roman Catholic peer and supporter of the Stuart claim to the Crown. Background Widdrington was the son of William Widdrington, 3rd Baron Widdrington, by the Honourable Alethea Fairfax, daughter of Charles Fairfax, 5th Viscount Fairfax of Emley, and succeeded to his father's title and estates in 1695.thepeerage.com William Widdrington, 4th Baron Widdrington of Blankney He was a member of a staunchly Roman Catholic family and was educated at a Jesuit college in Paris. He became a supporter of the Stuart claim to the Crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Political activity Widdrington took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715, and with two of his brothers was taken prisoner after the Battle of Preston. Along with Henry Oxburgh he counselled the commander of the English rising Thomas Forster and seek what terms he could from the army commander Charles Wills. He was convicted of high treason and condemned to death, but was reprieved after an intervention by Catherine Graham. Although his title and estates were forfeited, he was not executed but was allowed to retire to Bath. Family Widdrington married Jane Tempest in 1700 and resided at Stella Hall, Blaydon- on-Tyne, Northumberland. His wife Jane died in 1714, and in 1718 he married Catherine Graham, the daughter of Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston. In 1739, Catherine and her sister Mary inherited the estate at Nunnington Hall, Yorkshire, from their nephew Charles, third and last Viscount Preston, who died without issue. After Widdrington's death on 17 April 1743, he was interred in his wife's family vault at Nunnington Parish Church.Memorial Tablet in Nunnington Church.

Early life He was the son of John Morton of Tackley, Oxfordshire and was educated at John Roysse's Free School in Abingdon (now Abingdon School) and Trinity College, Oxford. Personal life Medmenham Abbey today Morton bought the ruins of Medmenham Abbey in 1778. He married Elizabeth, the daughter of Paul Jodrell of Duffield, Derbyshire. He was a Steward of the OA Club in 1749. Career He entered the Inner Temple in 1732, was called to the bar in 1740 and made a bencher in 1758. He was appointed Recorder of Woodstock in 1743, made King's Counsel in 1758, Chief Justice of Chester from 1762 to his death and deputy high steward of Oxford University from 1770 to his death. Morton was returned as Member of Parliament for Abingdon at the 1747 general election. In 1765, a Bill of Regency came before Parliament, to make provisions should George III die unexpectedly. The terms of the Bill and the choice of regents rapidly became the subject of debate between Whigs and Tories, particularly the question of whether the King's mother, the Dowager Princess of Wales, should be capable to serve as Regent. (Her connection with Lord Bute had made her the target of Whig attacks.) George Grenville, who opposed her appointment, represented to the King that a Regency Bill inclusive of her could not pass the House of Commons. The King reluctantly consented, not wishing to re-open the accusations against his mother, and the Bill passed the House of Lords excluding the Princess. However, the Chancellor, Lord Northington, discovering the circumstances, he gave Morton secret instructions. Morton, in what Lord Temple called \\"a dull speech\\", proposed to amend the Bill and add the Princess to it; he was seconded by Edward Kynaston and thirded by Samuel Martin, the Princess' treasurer, and the amendment unexpectedly passed. The Whigs were largely unwilling to divide and go on the record opposing the amendment, and the amended bill passed both Commons and Lords, notwithstanding Grenville's prediction. The King was outraged, and dismissed Grenville soon after. Morton was re-elected for Abingdon in 1768, defeating Nathaniel Bayly by the narrow margin of two votes. However, the election was overturned on petition and Bayly declared the victor in 1770. Morton was able to obtain a seat from Sir Edward Dering, 6th Baronet, at New Romney, which he represented until the close of that Parliament in 1774. In the election of 1775, he was elected MP for Wigan, replacing Sir Beaumont Hotham, who had been appointed a Baron of the Exchequer.

Biography Jes√∫s Balmori y Gonzalez-Mondragon was born in Ermita, Manila on 10 January 1887. He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letr√°n and the University of Santo Tom√°s, where he excelled in Literature. He was married to Dolores Rodr√≠guez. Joaqu√≠n Balmori, a pioneer labor leader and the foremost organiser of labour unions in their Philippines, was his brother. In his early years, Balmori was already gathering literary honors and prizes for poetry. In a Rizal Day contest, his three poems, each bearing a different pen name, won the first, second, third prizes. Later, he figured in friendly poetical jousts, known as Balagtasan (in reference to Tagalog poet Francisco Balagt√°s), with other well-known poets n Spanish of his time, notably Manuel Bernab√© of Para√±aque and the Ilonggo Flavio Zaragosa Cano, emerging triumphant each time. Before the war, under the pseudonym \\"Batikuling\\", Balmori wrote a column called \\"Vida Manile√±a\\" for La Vanguardia, a daily afternoon newspaper. It was a trenchant critique of society‚Äôs power elite, showcasing his gift for irony and satirical humor, as well as serious verses. After the war, he wrote a similar column, \\"Vida Filipina\\", for the Voz de Manila. However, the number of Spanish-speaking readers was already diminishing by that time. It was his work as a lyric poet, however, on which his fame and reputation rested. Literary works In 1904, when he was 17, he published his first book of verses, Rimas Malayas; it was noted for its spiritual and nationalistic themes. A second volume containing his satirical verses, El Libro de mis Vidas Manile√±as, came out in 1928. In 1908, his poem \\"Gloria\\" was adjudged first prized winner in a contest sponsored by the newspaper El Renacimiento. In 1920, another poem, \\"A Nuestro Se√±or Don Quijote de la Mancha\\", received the major award in a contest promoted by Casas de Espa√±a. He reached the pinnacle of his success as a poet in November 1938 when his Mi Casa de Nipa, a collection of his best poems, gave him the first prize in the national literary contests held under the auspices of the Commonwealth Government, as a part of its third anniversary celebration. Critics began to notice his literary skills more when he joined a contest sponsored by El Renacimiento in commemoration of Rizal Day. Three of his poems won. These were \\"Specs\\", \\"Vae Victis\\" (Woe to the Victor), and \\"Himno A Rizal\\" (Hymn to Rizal). In 1940, his Mi Choza de Nipa (My Nipa Hut), another volume of poetry, won grand prize in a contest sponsored by the US- sponsored Commonwealth Government. He wrote three novels: Bancarrota de Almas (Failure of the Soul), Se Deshoj√≥ la Flor (I Tear The Pages Out of The Flower), and P√°jaros de Fuego (Birds of Fire) which was completed during the Japanese occupation. The themes of these novels revolved around the issues of sensuality, the privacy of morality, the existence of God, and man's limitations in society. He also wrote three-act dramas, which were performed to the capacity crowd at the Manila Grand Opera House: Compa√±ados de Gloria, Las de Sungkit en Malaca√±ang, Do√±a Juana LA Oca, Flor del Carmelo, and Hidra. In 1926, he and Bernab√© were awarded the Premio Z√≥bel for his contributions to Philippine literature. As ambassador Balmori was sent abroad as Philippine Ambassador of Goodwill to Spain, Mexico, South America, and Japan. In Spain, Generalissimo Francisco Franco decorated him with the Cross of the Falangistas. Death He was travelling in Mexico when he suffered partial paralysis. He died of throat cancer on 23 May 1948, shortly after writing his last poem, \\"A Cristo\\" (To Christ), which he dedicated to his wife. At the time of his death, he was a presidential technical assistant and a member of the Philippine Historical Research Committee.

Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi establish loose hyphal networks around the outside of hair roots, from which they penetrate the walls of cortical cells to form intracellular coils that can densely pack individual plant cells. However, the fungi do not penetrate plasma membranes of plant cells. Evidence suggests that coils only function for a period of a few weeks before the plant cell and fungal hyphae begin to degrade. The coil is the site where fungi exchange nutrients obtained from the soil for carbohydrates fixed through photosynthesis by the plant. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi have been shown to have enzymatic capabilities to break down complex organic molecules.Cairney, J. W. G., and R. M. Burke.1998. Extracellular enzyme activities of the ericoid mycorrhizal endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae (Read) Korf & Kernan: their likely roles in decomposition of dead plant tissue in soil. Plant and Soil 205: 181-192.Read, D. J., J. R. Leake, and J. Perez-Moreno. 2004. Mycorrhizal fungi as drivers of ecosystem processes in heathland and boreal forest biomes. Canadian Journal of Botany 82: 1243-1263. This may allow some ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to act as saprotrophs. However, the primary function of these enzymatic capabilities is likely to access organic forms of nutrients, such as nitrogen, whose mineralized forms are in very limiting quantities in habitats typically occupied by ericaceous plants. Fungal symbionts An isolate of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus, Gamarada debralockiae, isolated from Woollsia pungens The majority of research with ericoid mycorrhizal fungal physiology and function has focused on fungal isolates morphologically identified as Rhizoscyphus ericae, in the Ascomycota order Helotiales, now known to be a Pezoloma species.Baral HO and Berbee L. (2006) Hymenoscyphus subcarneus, a little known bryicolous discomycete found in the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa National Park. Acta Mycologia 41:11-20. In addition to Rhizoscyphus ericae, it is currently recognized that culturable Ascomycota such as Meliniomyces (closely allied with Rhizoscyphus ericae), Cairneyella variabilis, Gamarada debralockiae and Oidiodendron maius form ericoid mycorrhizas.Hambleton S, Sigler L (2005) Meliniomyces, a new anamorph genus for root-associated fungi with phylogenetic affinities to Rhizoscyphus ericae (‚â° Hymenoscyphus ericae), Leotiomycetes.

The application of DNA sequencing to fungal isolates and clones from environmental PCR has uncovered diverse fungal communities in ericoid roots, however, the ability of these fungi to form typical ericoid mycorrhizal coils has not been verified and some may be non-mycorrhizal endophytes, saprobes or parasites.Allen, T.

In addition to ascomycetes Sebacina species in the phylum Basidiomycota are also recognized as frequent, but unculturable, associates of ericoid roots, and can form ericoid mycorrhizas.Vohn√≠k M, P√°nek M, Fehrer J, Selosse M-A (2016) Experimental evidence of ericoid mycorrhizal potential within Serendipitaceae (Sebacinales). Mycorrhiza 26:831‚Äì846 Similarly, basidiomycetes from the order Hymenochaetales have also been implicated in ericoid mycorrhizal formation.Kolarik M, Vohnik M (2018) When the ribosomal DNA does not tell the truth: the case of the taxonomic position of Kurtia argillacea, an ericoid mycorrhizal fungus residing among Hymenochaetales. Fungal Biology 122:1‚Äì18 Geographic and host distribution The ericoid mycorrhizal symbiosis is widespread. Ericaceae species occupy at least some habitats on all continents except Antarctica.http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/welcome.html A few lineages within the Ericaceae do not form ericoid mycorrhizas, and instead form other types of mycorrhizas, including manzanita (Arctostaphylos), madrone (Arbutus), and the Monotropoidiae. The geographic distribution of many of the fungi is uncertain, primarily because the identification of the fungal partners has not always been easy, especially prior to the application of DNA- based identification methods. Fungi ascribed to Rhizoscyphus ericae have been identified from Northern and Southern Hemisphere habitats, but these are not likely all the same species. Some studies have also shown that fungal communities colonizing ericoid roots can lack specificity for different species of ericoid plant, suggesting that at least some of these fungi have a broad host range. Economic significance Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with several crop and ornamental species, such as blueberries, cranberries and Rhododendron. Inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi can influence plant growth and nutrient uptake.Scagel, C. F. 2005 Inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi alters fertilizer use of highbush blueberry cultivars. HortScience 40: 786-794. However, much less agricultural and horticultural research has been conducted with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi relative to arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi.

It is located approximately north of San Francisco in the Fort Point Group of lighthouses. The lighthouse features a small museum and giftshop. Guided tours of the light station as well as self-guided tours of the grounds are available daily. Geography The first European to record Point Arena was Spaniard Bartolom√© Ferrer in 1543, who named it Cabo de Fortunas (Spanish for \\"cape of fortunes\\"). The cape was renamed to Punta Delgado (narrow point) in 1775 by lieutenant Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra (commander of the schooner Sonora), part of a royal expedition chartered by the Viceroyalty of New Spain to map the north coast of Alta California. Later the point, and the small harbor town south of it, were called Barra de Arena (i.e. sandbar) and finally Point Arena (literally \\"sand point\\"). Point Arena is a narrow peninsula jutting around 1/2 mile (800 m) into the Pacific Ocean. This sandbar creates a natural hazard to navigation, and hence the need for a lighthouse and fog signal here. The first lighthouse The original tower, damaged by an earthquake in 1906 The lighthouse at this site was constructed in 1870. The brick-and-mortar tower included ornate iron balcony supports and a large keeper residence with enough space to house several families. In April 1906, a devastating earthquake struck the light station. The keeper's residence and lighthouse were damaged so severely they had to be demolished. The rebuilding Engineering drawing of Point Arena Lighthouse The United States Lighthouse Board contracted with a San Francisco based company to build a new lighthouse on the site, and specified that it had to be able to withstand any future earthquakes. The company chosen normally built factory smokestacks, which accounts for the final design for the new Point Arena Lighthouse, featuring steel reinforcement rods encased in concrete. This was the first lighthouse built this way. The new lighthouse began operation in 1908, nearly 18 months after the quake. It stands tall, and featured a 1st Order Fresnel Lens, over six feet in diameter and weighing more than six tons. The lens was made up of 666 hand-ground glass prisms all focused toward three sets of double bullseyes. It was these bullseyes that gave the Point Arena Lighthouse its unique \\"light signature\\" of two flashes every six seconds. The optics, which held an appraised value of over $3.5 million, was set in solid brass framework, and was built in France. The light Engineering drawing of device used to turn lighthouse beacon at Point Arena Lighthouse Prior to the introduction of electricity, the lens was rotated by a clockwork mechanism. The Keepers, or \\"wickies\\" as they were called, had to hand crank a 160-pound weight up the center shaft of the lighthouse every 75 minutes to keep the lens turning. Light was produced by a \\"Funck\\" hydraulic oil lamp, that needed to be refueled every four hours, and whose wicks would have to be trimmed regularly. Later, two 1,000 watt electric lamps were installed to replace the oil lamp, and a horsepower electric motor was installed to replace the clockworks. Modernization The lighthouse as it appears today In 1978, the original fog signal at the station was silenced, and a bell buoy was placed nearby. June 1977 brought the installation of an automated aircraft-type beacon on the balcony tower, and the historic 1st Order Fresnel Lens was discontinued. At the time, the lens was the only mercury-floated light still in existence in the Twelfth United States Coast Guard District. The 400-pound aircraft beacon had been replaced by a 40-pound modern rotating light that incorporates the Fresnel principles for the efficient projection of light. Reliability There is a battery-powered emergency system installed as a back-up in the event of a power failure. In addition, a radio beacon, with a signal that originates from the station, also assists mariners. The original oil lamp was visible for approximately , the 1st Order Fresnel Lens for and the current modern rotating light can be seen for . Manning Four men manned this family station and were provided with quarters as follows: One 4 bedroom unit, three 3-bedroom units. Other buildings are the light tower, paint locker, fuel locker, bosun locker and buildings housing the fire pump, water pumps and JP-5 fueling pumps. The station had a ¬Ω-ton pickup truck assigned which, among other things, was utilized to transport dependent school children to school three miles (5 km) from the station. Today In 1984, a nonprofit organization called the Point Arena Lighthouse Keepers acquired the light station as part of a 25-year land lease from the Coast Guard and the Department of Transportation. In November 2000, the nonprofit group became the official owners of the property due to their diligent historic preservation and educational efforts. Daily visitation, gift store sales, memberships and the rental of the historic Keeper's homes on the property as vacation houses, all provide income to the group, for ongoing preservation, facility upgrades, and educational endeavors.

Finding himself in a sort of spiritual crisis early in his calligraphy career, he started training in misogi under Kenzo Futaki, director of the Misogi no Renseikai (\\"Misogi Training Society\\"), who happened to be a former student of Morihei Ueshiba. Futaki advised him to learn aikido.Interview with Seiseki Abe  Seiseki Abe and Morihei Ueshiba  Abe met Morihei Ueshiba at the inauguration of the aikido dojo of Bansen Tanaka in Osaka in 1952 and began training immediately. He was particularly struck by the similarity between the breathing technique used in aikido, misogi and shodo and arrived to the conclusion that the three arts are pursuing the same ultimate goal - the comprehension of the concept of ki. He studied aikido under Ueshiba for many years while perfecting his shodo technique. Ueshiba gradually took interest in calligraphy and one day asked Abe to teach him shodo (around 1954). A very special relationship developed between the two men and from 1959 until his death, Ueshiba would regularly come to stay at Abe's home in Osaka to learn calligraphy and teach aikido at the traditional dojo Abe built for him just next to his house (the Ameno Takemusu Juku Dojo). Interview With Seiseki Abe Abe was verbally awarded the grade of 10th dan by Ueshiba, although the Aikikai only recognized him as 8th dan.  Later career  After the death of Ueshiba in 1969, Abe continued to teach both shodo and aikido at his dojo in Osaka. He had formed over 200 shodo shihan and had about 3000 students in the Kansai region as well as in the United States (New York, Los Angeles) and in Australia. He was an active member of the Nitten, the most important art organization in Japan. In aikido, one of his most notable former students is the movie actor and martial artist Steven Seagal. Abe is the author of the large \\"Aiki Jinja\\" stone carving at the Aiki Jinja shrine in Iwama.

The vast majority of Liberian Muslims are Malikite Sunni, with sizeable Shia and Ahmadiyya minorities. The primary Muslim ethnic groups are the Vai and Mandingo but also Gbandi, Kpelle and other ethnic groups. Historically, Liberian Muslims have followed a relaxed and liberal form of Islam that is heavily influenced by indigenous religions that were integrated into Islam when it came to Liberia in the 16th century with the collapse of the Songhai Empire in Mali. Islamic religious practices vary in cities and towns across the country. Younger Liberian Muslims, particularly in the cities along the coast, tend to be more secular but still practice Islam in everyday life. In rural areas, Liberian Muslims are more conservative in dressing modestly, performing prayers and attending religious studies. The practice of Islam in Liberia has been compared to Islam common in Senegal and Gambia, with strong orientation toward Sufism. The major Islamic holidays, Eid el Fitr, Ramadan and Eid al Adha, called Tabaski Day, are celebrated annually in Liberia. People have begun to go on Hajj to Mecca in recent years. Joint English-Arabic language, Quranic, and Muslim universities and Islamic studies schools have opened and been rebuilt in the capital Monrovia, rural towns and other cities. Islam appears to be experiencing revival alongside Christianity in the country as a result of the Liberian Civil War. America-Liberian Methodists, the first Christians in Liberia, arrived on January 7, 1822. Charles Taylor President Charles Taylor promulgated Islam for political reasons. Taylor, an ally of Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, trained in Libya before returning to Liberia. Taylor's government sent 220 Muslims to Mecca to do Hajj in 2001 and gave the Liberia Muslim's council a prominent building in Monrovia and the designation of two hours of national broadcasting weekly for Islam-related programming. Destruction of mosques A consequence of the civil war in Liberia was destruction of religious buildings, schools and places of worship across the country. In both urban and rural areas, government and opposition rebel forces destroyed numerous mosques belonging to Liberian Muslims from what the government considered enemy ethnic groups. Several massacres were also committed near mosques and schools. One of the most well known, barbaric and gruesome was the Bakerdu Massacre in the mainly Mandingo/Muslim Quardu Gboni District Lofa County on July 12, 1990. Over 400 civilians were killed (some by being burned alive) by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). Destroyed buildings still stand on uneven foundations, raddled with bullet holes, demolished walls or simply blasted to skeletal buildings. Such destruction not only led to many faithful followers fleeing their hometowns, cities and villages for refugee camps in Sierra Leone, Ghana and other neighboring countries but also destroyed Islamic architecture that represented the blend between traditional Liberian, West African and Arab architectural design and influences. In recent years, diaspora Liberians abroad who practice Islam and Liberians in Liberia have participated in joint projects to rebuild and finance the reconstruction of mosques in many towns in the countryside. 2000s Countries such as Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, etc. have created Diplomatic relations with Liberia. Islamic organizations provide help to Liberian Muslims wanting to go on Hajj to Mecca. Rev. Dr. Laurence Konmla Bropleh Esq., Liberia's Information Minister and a reverend, attended as a guest speaker. Minister Bropleh called on the nation's legislature to designate non-Christian holidays as national holidays, specifically Hajj. He also suggested establishing a religious advisory board, representing all of the major religions practiced in Liberia, to advise the President. Methodist leaders condemned Bropleh's comments and accused him of fueling inter-religious tension.

A year after the 1935 death of Poland's Chief of State Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, in mid-1936, one of his followers, Marshal Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, attempted to unite the various government factions under his leadership. The attempt failed as another (opposing) Sanacja politician, President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki, likewise had a large following; nevertheless, substantial numbers of people did throw their lot in with Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy. On February 21, 1937, diplomat and Colonel Adam Koc formally announced the formation of OZN. Its stated aims were to improve Poland's national defense and to safeguard the April 1935 Constitution. OZN was strongly pro-military, and its politicians sought to portray Marshal Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy as Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's heir, describing Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy as the \\"second person in the country\\" after President Mo≈õcicki‚Äîa claim that had no foundation in the Polish Constitution.

TBA was founded to serve San Francisco's vital artistic community, and is today the largest regional theatre service organization in North America, serving as a model for other service organizations around the country. The San Francisco Bay Area is the third largest theatre center in the country, with more than 400 companies in 12 counties. The region has more theatre companies per capita than almost any other metropolitan area in the U.S. and is home to the third largest community of Equity (union) actors, following New York City and Chicago. Some 200 new plays are premiered in San Francisco each year, many going on to wider success. Theatre Bay Area‚Äôs present membership is derived from 12 Bay Area counties (the 9 counties plus Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Joaquin counties) and consists of more than 365 Bay Area theatre and dance companies, from multimillion-dollar organizations to grassroots community groups; some 3,000 individuals, including actors, directors, designers, playwrights, technicians and theatre patrons; and more than 100 organizational members, from libraries and universities to theatre industry professional services. Theatre Bay Area‚Äôs most prominent programs include TIX Bay Area (‚Äúonline or in line‚Äù ticketing services), Theatre Bay Area magazine (the central source for information on the Bay Area‚Äôs theatre community), numerous re-granting programs for emerging theatre companies and local theatre artists, their Web site containing comprehensive theatre listings available in the Bay Area, and advocacy for the theatre and dance community on the local, state, and national level.  TIX Bay Area  TIX Bay Area is walk-up box office selling half-price and full price theater tickets on the day of performance or in advance to select events. TIX is Located on Union Square, San Francisco, California in the heart of San Francisco's premier shopping and hotel district.  Theatre Bay Area Magazine  The first issue, a mimeographed single page, appeared in January 1976 (it took the name Callboard four months later). The single page turned into a couple of stapled pages. In September 1987, under Theatre Bay Area's executive director and Callboard managing editor Deborah Allen, the publication grew to a 7-inch-by-11-inch format. In 1987, one color was added. The September 1988 issue was Jean Schiffman's first as editor (she was previously the organization's communications director, and before that a publications associate). Belinda Taylor became editor in June 1993 and by October 1993 had completely redesigned the magazine, inside and out. The result is the roughly 8.5-inch-by-11-inch magazine Theatre Bay Area Magazine has today. Finally the name Callboard was changed to Theatre Bay Area Magazine in January 2004 in an attempt to more accurately reflect its content. Not only does the magazine have up to date audition listings that Callboard got its start publishing in 1976, but it also covers several stories and articles about the whole Bay Area theatre scene and theatre in general.

It is located 12 km south of Napier and ten kilometres east of Hastings. The village incorporates a school, a Presbyterian Church, a general store, a takeaway shop, a hall and a fire station. The village was developed as a holiday settlement with beaches, and the surrounding area has historically been used for sheep and cattle grazing and horticulture. However, lifestyle blocks and grape growing have become more prominent in recent times. Many inhabitants commute to the nearby cities to work. There are approximately 430 houses in Haumoana. The population at the 2013 census was 2256, an increase of 54 people since 2006. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"sea breeze\\" for Haumoana. The area is flat and low lying, with hills to the southwest. The underlying soil material has been laid down by rivers and the sea margin. Particle size ranges from gravel to clay. Nearer the beach the area is underlain by free draining sandy-gravels but further inland the gravels are overlain by poor draining silt and clay rich soils. Parts of the beach are experiencing coastal erosion of 0.7 metres per year, which resulted in the removal of several houses along the gravel beach crest, and other beach front properties being inundated during heavy swells and high tides. Due to its location near the beach in an area prone to coastal erosion, parts of the beach at Haumoana is being eroded. The long term shoreline retreat at Haumoana is on average between 0.30 m and 0.70 m per year. This rate of erosion is the same as it is at Te Awanga further down the Bay coastline.

They lived with Buckley, who by letters of 1607 and 1609Taunton, The English Black Monks of St Benedict, II, pp. 80‚Äì83. granted and confirmed to them authority to admit brethren to membership of the monastery and Congregation of which he had been the only surviving representative. To Preston, already the superior of the English of the Congregation of Monte Cassino, he entrusted the care of the English Congregation.H.Connolly, 'The Buckley Affair', in Downside Review 30 (1931) 49‚Äì74.

Buckley died in 1610.Weldon, Chronological Notes, pp. 46, 76. Meanwhile, Preston had been indicted as a priest, and was soon afterwards imprisoned. Expelled from England three years later, he took part at Rheims in the negotiations for the union of the English monks of Monte Cassino, Valladolid, and the old English Congregation.Weldon, Chronological Notes, pp. 94‚Äì95: Taunton, The English Black Monks of St Benedict, II, pp. 85‚Äì87. He returned to England and was again imprisoned, first in The Clink in Southwark, and later in Croydon Palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Preston passed much of the rest of his life in prison. He died in The Clink prison, 5 April 1640. In one prison or another he wrote, under the assumed name of Widdrington, several works treating of the oath of allegiance.The terms of the oath are given by Taunton, The English Black Monks of St Benedict, II, pp. 103‚Äì04, note 2.

Towards the end of his life, however, he seems to have altered his views, or at any rate to have made full submission on the question of the oath to the authorities of Rome.Weldon says 'he maintained a bad cause too well, which upon better considerations he afterwards detested', Chronological Notes, p. 40.

These publications upheld the oath of allegiance to King James I, which the King himself was proposing (Preston being one of the group of Benedictines and secular priests who were apologists for it), against the opposing policy of the Jesuits. The 1611 Apologia was given a false imprimatur although in fact being published in London by government order: it is possible that the real Widdrington was complicit in the use of his name, though it was quickly recognised that he was unlikely to be the true author.dom Maurus Lunn, 'The Anglo-Gallicanism of dom Thomas Preston', pp. 242‚Äì3.

September 20, 2006 The Alaska Volcano Observatory upgraded Fourpeaked volcano from the classification \\"not assigned\\" to Level of Concern Color Code Yellow on September 20, 2006. This color-coded system was later renamed the Aviation Alert Level, but with the same color-coding system. At that time they began installing seismic monitoring equipment on the mountain and using fixed-wing aircraft as well as helicopters to monitor the volcano. September 25, 2006 AVO eruption warning On September 25, 2006, the AVO warned that Fourpeaked would likely erupt again, and released the following information as part of a special information release: October 3, 2006 The Alaska Volcano Observatory completed installation of another seismometer near Fourpeaked. Almost immediately they detected an earthquake swarm of lower magnitude quakes. This behavior continued intermittently through the spring of 2007. Fourpeaked also continued to vent volcanic gases at the same rate as revealed in earlier air sampling. Fourpeaked Mountain with active fumaroles and sulfur deposits on February 22, 2007 February 2007 In February, 2007 Fourpeaked began showing a relatively small but noticeable increase in activity. The Alaska Volcano Observatory reported February 8‚Äì9 that: \\"Three small explosive events were recorded by seismic and acoustic instruments Thursday and Friday (February 08‚Äì09) beginning at 10:36 AM AKST (1936 UTC) February 08. A possible large steam plume was observed in several partly cloudy satellite views Thursday afternoon.\\" On February 18, the AVO reported a swarm of 13 small earthquakes under Fourpeaked, with the largest measuring 1.8 on the Richter magnitude scale. On February 23, the AVO conducted a gas flight and detected the continued emission of sulfur dioxide (SO2). March 2007 The Alaska Volcano Observatory began reporting in its Daily Update on Fourpeaked volcano that \\"several small explosion signals\\" were detected overnight, apparently continuing the series of small explosions which began on February 8. These \\"small explosions\\" continued until June, when Fourpeaked's classification was lowered to Green.

In 1958, the presidents of Amherst College, Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst (together with Hampshire they are known as the Five Colleges consortium), all located in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts, formed the Committee for an Experimental College/Committee for New College to explore the creation of an experimental college to put into practice new ideas in academic organization and curriculum. The intent of these new ideas was to enable students to educate themselves, develop independence, and take responsibility for their own education.New College Plan p.4 Suggested curricular innovations included the freshman seminar, a midwinter (January) term, academic departments replaced by broad groupings of faculty (Social Sciences, Humanities, Sciences), cooperation with the sponsoring institutions, and individualized programs of concentration replacing defined majors.New College Plan, p. 10-12 It also placed emphasis on multidisciplinary learning and close faculty interaction. Making this all possible was the idea of providing a liberal arts college education at the minimum cost per student, allowing the school to survive on tuition alone. The Committee for New College issued two further reports, Student Reactions to Study Facilities (1960) and More Power to Them (1962). Student Reactions to Study Facilities: with implications for architects and college administrators (1960) reported on an extensive survey of college students in the area colleges, indicating their preferences for small or individual study spaces whether in libraries or dormitory rooms.Student Reactions to Study Facilities, p.8 More Power to Them: a report of faculty and student experience in the encouragement of student initiative (1962), describes a series of twelve experimental courses conducted by faculty during the 1959-60 academic year. These courses attempted to promote student independence through implementing two of the ideas detailed in the New College Plan: the freshman seminar, and the student-led seminar for more advanced students. Eight of the courses were judged successes; one a failure; and the rest had mixed results. One important finding was that more of the instructor's time was needed for supervising such independent work (in comparison to standard lecture courses), rather than less.More Power to Them, p.55 The Committee's resulting work, in conjunction with a focused vision of Hampshire College published in 1965 by Franklin Patterson and Charles R. Longsworth in The Making of a College, along with the donation of $6,000,000 by Amherst alumnus Harold Johnson, implemented the New College Plan in the formation of Hampshire College in South Amherst, Massachusetts. The New College Plan was widely disseminated and studied R.H.E., Editorial. Journal of Higher Education, v.30(5):285-286, May 1959 and influenced the development of other colleges' programs such as the Midwinter or January Term. Other institutions influenced by the New College Plan include the New College of Florida.Arthur, Furman C. New College: the first three decades. Sarasota, FL: New College, 1995, p. 42-44 The original 1958 New College Plan offered to: \\"...dethrone the course as the unit of knowledge...[and] dethrones the idea that a college must be an intellectual autarchy: the course offering is to be developed so as to take advantage for collateral purposes of resources available at neighboring institutions.[...]The New College Plan is based on the conviction that the average student entering one of the better colleges is capable of far more independence than he now demonstrates, but that he must be given proper training and proper opportunities.\\"New College Plan 8-9 Notes External links * Hampshire College Planning Bodies (Five College Archives) References *The New College Plan.

Recording and Style The album was recorded in between from November 26-28 and December 13, 1993 at Avast! Studios in Seattle, Washington. As pointed out in The Vinyl Factory's review for the album, New Plastic Ideas is a somewhat a step away from the feedback-ridden sound of its predecessor Fake Train and focuses more on melody and odd time signatures, although the band has stated that this was unintentional. Title The album's title was once thought of a reference to the artist Piet Mondrian, however as explained by guitarist Justin Trosper, the name was simply made up on the spot. Release and Cover The album was released on March 21, 1994 through independent label Kill Rock Stars, their second full-length for the label. The album was issued on compact disc, vinyl, and cassette formats, and the front cover photo is taken from the Philippe Entremont record Grieg: Concerto in A Minor for Piano and Orchestra. After being out-of-print for years, the album was made available on LP format again when it was included (with Fake Train) on the band's 2014 boxset Rat Conspiracy. Reception Peter J. D'Angelo of Allmusic wrote that the album features \\"more coherently focused attempts at songwriting than their debut effort, and, on a whole, the Fugazi meets Sonic Youth in a dark alley musical theatrics really start to sound polished this time around.\\" \\"Compared to the more technically adept work the band moved towards on later records,\\" he writes, \\"New Plastic Ideas isn't their most groundbreaking, but in the scheme of things it sees the band move towards a darker and more note-oriented structure while still retaining the chugging dissonance that would continue to characterize them for their next few records.\\" \\"Entirely Different Matters\\", \\"Hexenzsene\\" and \\"All Souls Day\\" were chosen as highlights. Ira Robbins and Michael Azzerad of Trouser Press wrote that the album \\"finds Unwound branching out into propulsive odd meters, a vastly bigger sound and even more traumatic contrasts between loud and soft, pulling the arty riffage into much tighter focus. There's even something resembling melody emerging on songs such as \\"Envelope,\\" \\"Hexenzsene\\" and the downright Cure-ish instrumental \\"Abstraktions\\" ‚Äî but the band's strength remains the art of noise, as in the staccato dissonance of \\"All Souls Day\\" and the way the roiling mass of distortion in \\"Usual Dosage\\" gives way to a lambent middle passage of tinkling, ringing tones.\\" Legacy Much like its predecessor, the album received a lot of critical attention upon its release through the 2014 box-set Rat Conspiracy. Pitchfork noted \\"a huge leap in articulation here, both in gesture and enunciation, from Fake Train.\\" The song \\"Envelope\\" was called \\"one of Unwound‚Äôs most indelible songs, a study in inverted, charred-hearted near- pop‚Äîmelody morphs into menace and is never resolved\\" while \\"Abstraktions\\" \\"veers down a harrowing, Side-Two-of-Joy-Division‚Äôs-Closer corridor.\\" The review by writing that both it and its predecessor \\"hold important places in the history of 90s music, not to mention those of punk and indie as a whole.\\" Delusions of Adequacy called it \\"a catalog highlight [...] one of the band's very best albums\\", singling out \\"All Soul's Day\\" as \\"one of the most punishing moments in the Unwound repertoire.\\" Popmatters called it \\"a furious classic of a record. They addressed the frustration and isolation that so many indie bands of their ilk addressed, but few could transmogrify those feelings into a sound this crafted yet unruly, into a sound that could vacillate between the claustrophobia of being lonely and the sometimes scary open space of being alone.\\" Treble rated the album an 8.9 out of 10, writing that \\"[t]here are four major factors here: Raw emotion, tidal waves of noise, head-banging hooks, and trippy instrumental transitions.

Point Bonita was the last manned lighthouse on the California coast. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. History More than 300 boats ran aground near the Golden Gate during the California Gold Rush years, requiring a lighthouse. The original Point Bonita Lighthouse, a brick tower, was built in 1855 at above sea level with a second order Fresnel lens. This was too high. Unlike the East Coast of the United States, the West Coast has dense high fog, which leaves lower elevations clear. Since the original light was so high, it was often cloaked in fog and could not be seen from the sea. As a result, the lighthouse was moved to its current location at above sea level in 1877. To access the new site, a long tunnel was hand carved through hard rock. The lighthouse had the first fog signal on the West Coast, in the form of a 24-pounder siege gun. Up until 1940 the lighthouse could be reached by a trail, but erosion caused the trail to crumble into the sea. A wooden walkway was installed, but when that became treacherous a suspension bridge was built in 1954. This is the only lighthouse in the United States which can only be reached by a suspension bridge. The suspension bridge underwent repairs in 1979 and again in 1991, but the metal components were not able to stand up to the sea spray. As a result, the suspension bridge to the light house was closed to public access on January 6, 2010. According to the Federal Highway Administration, the bridge, which was 56 years old, had started to rust. It was replaced by a new span which opened April 13, 2012. The new bridge construction cost a little over $1 million. It is made of tropical hardwood with steel suspension cables and attachments. The United States Coast Guard currently maintains the light and fog signal. Public access The lighthouse is accessible to the public during limited hours (12:30‚Äì3:30 p.m.) on Sundays and Mondays,https://www.nps.gov/goga/pobo.htm as well as on ranger-led interpretive sunset hikes, which requires a sign-up. Access to the bridge is barred at other times by a metal door on the shore end of the tunnel. Gallery In popular media On the television show Murder in the First the lighthouse was a setting at the end of the second-season episode \\"Schizofrenzy\\".

Zygo Corporation is part of the Ultra Precision Technologies Division of AMETEK, Inc.‚Äîa global manufacturer with annual sales of $4 billion. Early history ZYGO was founded in 1970 by Paul Forman, Carl Zanoni, and Sol Laufer, with financial support from Canon Inc. (Japan) and Wesleyan University (CT, USA). An initial priority for the Company was to build a world-class optical fabrication facility for producing optics with the highest precision plano surfaces and angles C. Zanoni, \\"Zygo Corp measures 40 years,\\" Opt. Phot. News (November, 2010) . It was recognized that in order to achieve such a goal, practical and easy-to-use interferometry would have to be a standard part of the fabrication process. While there were several interferometers available on the market at that time, none had all the flexibility or features ZYGO considered important to their goal. So the decision was made to design an interferometer for in-house use. However, as the concepts for this new interferometer began to develop, ZYGO recognized that others might have a similar need, and the in-house breadboard interferometer was soon converted to a program to develop ZYGO's first product; the Model GH Interferometer, named for ZYGO's first non-founding employee, George Hunter. In 1972, ZYGO introduced the model GH-1 interferometer system at the annual meeting of the Optical Society of America. The GH was the first commercial interferometer to incorporate an alignment system that enabled an operator to quickly obtain a fringe pattern. The system was modular in design, and incorporated the ability to use bayonet-mounted transmission elements to enable the construction of various configurations for testing different kinds of optics. Transmission elements, such as transmission flats and transmission spheres, was a new concept based upon a Fizeau unequal path configuration. This construction greatly simplified the optics required for the interferometer and significantly increased the accuracy to which an interferometer could be made to operate. In conjunction with a patented quick fringe acquisition system and alignment scheme, this provided a flexible, rapid-to-change and easy-to-use instrument. In 1973, with 16 employees, ZYGO moved into a new facility in Middlefield, Connecticut. In 1981, with a growth rate averaging about 50% per year, ZYGO expanded to a facility, also in Middlefield, CT. In December 1983, ZYGO completed its initial public offering. On April 11th 2014, Ametek announced that it agreed to buy Zygo Corp. Ametek to Buy Zygo for About $364 Million in Wall Street Journal.

In particular, it causes measured parallaxes to stars to be larger than their actual values. The bias towards measuring larger parallaxes in turn results in an underestimate of distance and therefore an underestimate on the object's luminosity. For a given parallax measurement with an accompanying uncertainty, both stars closer and farther may, because of uncertainty in measurement, appear at the given parallax. Assuming uniform stellar distribution in space, the probability density of the true parallax per unit range of parallax will be proportional to 1/p^4 (where p is the true parallax), and therefore, there will be more stars in the volume shells at farther distance. As a result of this dependence, more stars will have their true parallax smaller than the observed parallax. Thus, the measured parallax will be systematically biased towards a value larger than the true parallax. This causes inferred luminosities and distances to be too small, which poses an apparent problem to astronomers trying to measure distance. The existence (or otherwise) of this bias and the necessity of correcting for it has become relevant in astronomy with the precision parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite and more recently with the high-precision data releases of the Gaia mission. The correction method due to Lutz and Kelker placed a bound on the true parallax of stars. This is not valid because true parallax (as distinct from measured parallax) cannot be known. Integrating over all true parallaxes (all space) assumes that stars are equally visible at all distances, and leads to divergent integrals yielding an invalid calculation. Consequently, the Lutz- Kelker correction should not be used. In general, other corrections for systematic bias are required, depending on the selection criteria of the stars under consideration. The scope of effects of the bias are also discussed in the context of the current higher-precision measurements and the choice of stellar sample where the original stellar distribution assumptions are not valid. These differences result in the original discussion of effects to be largely overestimated and highly dependent on the choice of stellar sample. It also remains possible that relations to other forms of statistical bias such as the Malmquist bias may have a counter-effect on the Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias for at least some samples.  Mathematical Description   Original Description   The Distribution Function  Mathematically, the Lutz-Kelker Bias originates from the dependence of the number density on the observed parallax that is translated into the conditional probability of parallax measurements. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of the observed parallax about the true parallax due to errors in measurement, we can write the conditional probability distribution function of measuring a parallax of p_o given that the true parallax is p as g(p_o|p) = \\\\dfrac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi \\\\sigma}} \\\\exp{\\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{-(p_o-p)^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}\\\\Big)} since the estimation is of a true parallax based on the measured parallax, the conditional probability of the true parallax being p, given that the observed parallax is p_ois of interest. In the original treatment of the phenomenon by Lutz & Kelker, this probability, using Bayes theorem, is given as g(p|p_o) = \\\\dfrac{g(p_o|p) \\\\ g(p)}{g(p_o)} where g(p) dp and g(p_o) dp_o are the prior probabilities of the true and observed parallaxes respectively.  Dependence on Distance  The probability density of finding a star with apparent magnitude m at a distance s can be similarly written as h(s|m) = \\\\dfrac{h(m|s)\\\\ h(s)}{h(m)} where h(m|s) is the probability density of finding a star with apparent magnitude m with a given distance s. Here, h(m|s) will be dependent on the luminosity function of the star, which depends on its absolute magnitude. h(m) is the probability density function of the apparent magnitude independent of distance. The probability of a star being at distance s will be proportional to s^2 such that h(s) \\\\propto n(s) \\\\ s^2 Assuming a uniform distribution of stars in space, the number density n(s) becomes a constant and we can write g(p) \\\\ dp = h(s|m) \\\\ \\\\Bigg \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial s}{\\\\partial p} \\\\Bigg |_m \\\\ dp \\\\propto s^2 \\\\Bigg \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial s}{\\\\partial p} \\\\Bigg |_m dp, where s = 1/p. Since we deal with the probability distribution of the true parallax based on a fixed observed parallax, the probability density g(p_o) becomes irrelevant and we can conclude that the distribution will have the proportionality g(p|p_o) \\\\propto g(p|p_o) \\\\ p^{-4} and thus, g(p|p_o) \\\\propto \\\\dfrac{1}{p^4} \\\\exp\\\\Big({-\\\\dfrac{(p-p_o)^2}{2 \\\\ \\\\sigma^2}}\\\\Big)  Normalization  The conditional probability of the true parallax based on the observed parallax is divergent around zero for the true parallax. Therefore, it is not possible to normalize this probability. Following the original description of the bias, we can define a normalization by including the observed parallax as g(p|p_o) \\\\propto \\\\Big(\\\\dfrac{p_o}{p}\\\\Big)^4 \\\\ \\\\exp\\\\Big({-\\\\dfrac{(p-p_o)^2}{2 \\\\ \\\\sigma^2}}\\\\Big) The inclusion of p_o does not affect proportionality since it is a fixed constant. Moreover, in this defined \\"normalization\\", we will get a probability of 1 when the true parallax is equal to the observed parallax, regardless of the errors in measurement. Therefore, we can define a dimensionless parallax Z := p/p_o and get the dimensionless distribution of the true parallax as G(Z) \\\\propto Z^{-4} \\\\ \\\\exp\\\\Big({-\\\\dfrac{(Z-1)^2}{2 \\\\ (\\\\sigma/ p_o)^2}}\\\\Big) Here, Z=1 represents the point where the measurement in parallax is equal to its true value, where the probability distribution should be centered. However, this distribution, due to Z^{-4} factor will deviate from the point Z=1 to smaller values. This presents the systematic Lutz-Kelker Bias. The value of this bias will be based on the value of \\\\sigma / p_o, the marginal uncertainty in parallax measurement.  Scope of Effects   Original Treatment  In the original treatment of the Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias as it was first proposed the uncertainty in parallax measurement is considered to be the sole source of bias. As a result of the parallax dependence of stellar distributions, smaller uncertainty in the observed parallax will result in only a slight bias from the true parallax value. Larger uncertainties in contrast would yield higher systematic deviations of the observed parallax from its true value. Large errors in parallax measurement become apparent in luminosity calculations and are therefore easy to detect. Consequently, the original treatment of the phenomenon considered the bias to be effective when the uncertainty in the observed parallax, \\\\sigma, is close to about 15% of the measured value, p_o. This was a very strong statement indicating that if the uncertainty in the parallax in about 15‚Äì20%, the bias is so effective that we lose most of the parallax and distance information. Several subsequent work on the phenomenon refuted this argument and it was shown that the scope is actually very sample based and may be dependent on other sources of bias. Therefore, more recently it is argued that the scope for most stellar samples is not as drastic as first proposed.  Subsequent Discussions  Following the original statement, the scope of the effects of the bias, as well as its existence and relative methods of correction have been discussed in many works in recent literature, including subsequent work of Lutz himself. Several subsequent work state that the assumption of uniform stellar distribution may not be applicable depending on the choice of stellar sample. Moreover, the effects of different distributions of stars in space as well as that of measurement errors would yield different forms of bias. This suggests the bias is largely dependent on the specific choice of sample and measurement error distributions, although the term Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias is commonly used generically for the phenomenon on all stellar samples. It is also questioned whether other sources of error and bias such as the Malmquist Bias actually counter-effect or even cancel the Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias, so that the effects are not as drastic as initially described by Lutz and Kelker. Overall, such differences are discussed to result in effects of the bias to be largely overestimated in the original treatment. More recently, the effects of the Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias became relevant in the context of the high-precision measurements of Gaia mission. The scope of effects of Lutz‚ÄìKelker bias on certain samples is discussed in the recent Gaia data releases, including the original assumptions and the possibility of different distributions. It remains important to take bias effects with caution regarding sample selection as stellar distribution is expected to be non-uniform at large distance scales. As a result, it is questioned whether correction methods, including the Lutz-Kelker correction proposed in the original work, are applicable for a given stellar sample, since effects are expected to depend on the stellar distribution. Moreover, following the original description and the dependence of the bias on the measurement errors, the effects are expected to be lower due to the higher precision of current instruments such as Gaia. History The original description of the phenomenon was presented in a paper by Thomas E. Lutz and Douglas H. Kelker in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Vol. 85, No. 507, p. 573 article entitled \\"On the Use of Trigonometric Parallaxes for the Calibration of Luminosity Systems: Theory.\\" although it was known following the work of Trumpler & Weaver in 1953. The discussion on statistical bias on measurements in astronomy date back to as early as to Eddington in 1913.

Only the purple needletail of Asia may be slightly larger.CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . This bird is found principally in western and central Mexico, with one record on the Guatemalan border. This species is essentially a bird of wild highland landscapes, where it favors cliff faces, deep river gorges and high crags. Its main habitats are pine-oak forests, tropical deciduous forests and second-growth scrub. This swift is usually found at an elevation of and, much more rarely, down to sea level. The white- naped swift is huge for a swift, measuring long, being some 20% larger than its more common and much more widespread cousin, the white-collared swift. Weight in the species can vary from with a reported average weight of . The adults are brown-black, glossed blue on the back, and have a white crescent on the nape. The tail is fairly squared off, but can be held in a minorly notched way when flying. The more widespread white-collared swift is similar, sometimes measuring nearly as large. The white-collar, however, has a complete white collar (whereas the White-nape has no white on the underside) and has a strongly notched tail. This is a gregarious species, with breeding colonies sometimes including up to 200 individuals. It has been observed roosting alongside several other species of swift as well. Breeding colonies often forage together to several miles away from the breeding site. It has a powerful, fast and direct flight, and will ascent thermals to great heights. White-naped swifts feeds in flight on a variety of flying insects, including beetles, bees and flying ants. The nest is typically a shallow depression (made by the parents) in dry sand, usually lacking any materials or saliva, although they are apparently picky about the consistency of the soil used. The nests have usually been found in caves, with the nest located on ledges off the main chamber. Two white eggs are laid. The details of brooding behavior are not known. This swift is normally silent when seen solitary and noisy when encountered in a group. The call is described as cree-cree-cree. The call is delivered both while in flight and while perched on the walls of the nesting cave.

It has been a federal aid to navigation since 1909. It is part of the California state park system as Point Cabrillo Light Station State Historic Park. It should not be confused with the inactive Old Point Loma Lighthouse or the active New Point Loma Lighthouse in San Diego, both of which lie within the grounds of Cabrillo National Monument and are sometimes referred to as the Cabrillo lighthouse. Description The Point Cabrillo Lighthouse complex is located about north of Mendocino, California, and includes the lighthouse itself together with several outbuildings. Most of the original structures remain, but the barn is missing: in 1986 it was destroyed in a fire department exercise. The remaining lighthouse station is \\"one of the most complete light stations in the United States\\".. Atop the lighthouse spins a third-order Fresnel lens with four panels containing 90 lead glass prisms and weighing 6800 pounds, constructed by Chance Brothers, an English company, and shipped to Point Cabrillo around Cape Horn. The light is only above the ground, but because of the height of the headlands it stands above sea level. It was originally lit by a kerosene lamp and turned by a clockwork mechanism but this was replaced by an electric light and motor in 1935. The present light uses a single 1000-watt electric filament. Depending on atmospheric conditions, the Fresnel lens creates a focused beam which can be seen to the horizon and beyond. The beam rotates once every 40 seconds, producing a flash every 10 seconds. History Point Cabrillo, the sandstone headland on which the Point Cabrillo Light lies, was named in 1870 by the United States Geological Survey after the Portuguese explorer Jo√£o Rodrigues Cabrilho, although Cabrillo's voyage of exploration on behalf of Spain along the California coast did not reach as far north as the point. Because Spain controlled early California, the Spanish derivation of his name is the one used today. The opium-trading brig Frolic wrecked on a reef north of Point Cabrillo in 1850; the investigation of the wreck by agents of Henry Meiggs led to the discovery of the coast redwood forests of the Mendocino area and the beginning of the timber trade that would drive the local economy for decades..The wreckage of the Frolic was rediscovered in 1984 and was the subject of a 2003 episode of the History Channel series Deep Sea Detectives entitled \\"Gold Rush Disaster: The Frolic\\". A more distant view of the lighthouse In 1873, Point Cabrillo was surveyed as a potential site for a lighthouse; however, no lighthouse was built at that time. By 1904, several shipwrecks later, the U.S. Lighthouse Service recommended that a lighthouse be placed at the point. The bill to fund its construction, Senate Bill 6648, passed in June 1906, and the government bought 30 acres of land on Point Cabrillo from rancher David Gordon for $3,195. The lighthouse was constructed by the Lindgren Company beginning in 1908, and began operation in 1909. Its first light keeper was Wilhelm Baumgartner, who held the position until 1923. In 1935, an air diaphone supertyfone sound signal was installed. The United States Coast Guard took over the Lighthouse Service in 1939. The lighthouse building sustained major damage in 1960 after a storm caused waves that crested above the light and flooded the building with mud, but the lens remained undamaged. Later during the Cold War, the station was used to simulate a Soviet radar base in training exercises. The Coast Guard manned the station until 1973, when the lens was covered and a modern rotating beacon was mounted on a metal stand on the roof west of the lantern room. In 1988 the California Coastal Conservancy began buying the land surrounding the light station, and in 1991 the station was added to the National Register of Historic Places. However, the California State Park System declined to take over the land at that time because of state budget shortfalls; instead, the station was managed for nine years by a non- profit organization, the North Coast Interpretive Association. Beginning in 1996, the NCIA organized a major restoration of the station to the state it would have been in the 1930s, after it was electrified, including a return to active duty of the main lens of the light. In 1999, the original third-order Fresnel lens was reinstalled after being upgraded to meet more modern standards. Before it could be used the light had to be as reliable as a Directional Code Beacon, which is commonly used at airports. The restored lighthouse was opened to the public in August 2001, and appeared in the Warner Bros. 2001 drama film The Majestic. In 2002, California State Parks purchased the light station for four million dollars. The NCIA, which then became the Point Cabrillo Light Keeper Association, continued to run the station for the state park system. The station won the Governor's Historic Preservation Award in 2007,Governor's Award 2007, Point Cabrillo Light Station, accessed 2014-10-14. and the Preservation Design Award of the California Preservation Foundation in the same year.Past PDA Winners , California Preservation Foundation, accessed 2011-12-25.

Compression testing is a crude form of leak-down testing which also includes effects due to compression ratio, valve timing, cranking speed, and other factors. Compression tests should normally be done with all spark plugs removed to maximize cranking speed. Cranking compression is a dynamic test of the actual low-speed pumping action, where peak cylinder pressure is measured and stored. Leak-down testing is a static test. Leak-down tests cylinder leakage paths. Leak-down primarily tests pistons and rings, seated valve sealing, and the head gasket. Leak-down will not show valve timing and movement problems, or piston movement related sealing problems. Any test should include both compression and leak-down. Testing is done on an engine which is not running, and normally with the tested cylinder at top dead center on compression, although testing can be done at other points in the compression and power stroke. Pressure is fed into a cylinder via the spark plug hole and the flow, which represents any leakage from the cylinder, is measured. Leak-down tests tend to rotate the engine, and often require some method of holding the crankshaft in the proper position for each tested cylinder. This can be as simple as a breaker bar on a crankshaft bolt in an automatic transmission vehicle, or leaving a manual transmission vehicle in a high gear with the parking brake locked. Leakage is given in wholly arbitrary percentages but these ‚Äúpercentages‚Äù do not relate to any actual quantity or real dimension. The meaning of the readings is only relative to other tests done with the same tester design. Leak-down readings of up to 20% are usually acceptable. Leakages over 20% generally indicate internal repairs are required. Racing engines would be in the 1-10% range for top performance, although this number can vary. Ideally, a baseline number should be taken on a fresh engine and recorded. The same leakage tester, or the same leakage tester design, can be used to determine wear. In the United States, FAA specificationsAdvisory Circular 43.13-1B, chapter eight state that engines up to engine displacement require an orifice diameter, long, 60-degree approach angle. The input pressure is set for , and minimum cylinder pressure is the accepted standard. While the leak-down tester pressurizes the cylinder, the mechanic can listen to various parts to determine where any leak may originate. For example, a leaking exhaust valve will make a hissing noise in the exhaust pipe while a head gasket may cause bubbling in the cooling system.  How it works  This schematic shows the component parts of a typical leak- down tester. The gauge on the right is held at a standard pressure by adjusting the pressure regulator while the gauge on the left shows an example reading of 85-or 15% leakage. A leak-down tester is essentially a miniature flow meter similar in concept to an air flow bench. The measuring element is the restriction orifice and the leakage in the engine is compared to the flow of this orifice. There will be a pressure drop across the orifice and another across any points of leakage in the engine. Since the meter and engine are connected in series, the flow is the same across both. (For example: If the meter was unconnected so that all the air escapes then the reading would be 0, or 100% leakage. Conversely, if there is no leakage there will be no pressure drop across either the orifice or the leak, giving a reading of 100, or 0% leakage). Gauge meter faces can be numbered 0-100 or 100-0, indicating either 0% at full pressure or 100% at full pressure. There is no standard regarding the size of the restriction orifice for non-aviation use and that is what leads to differences in readings between leak-down testers generally available from different manufacturers. Most often quoted though is a restriction with a .040in. hole drilled in it. Some poorly designed units do not include a restriction orifice at all, relying on the internal restriction of the regulator, and give much less accurate results. In addition, large engines and small engines will be measured in the same way (compared to the same orifice) but a small leak in a large engine would be a large leak in a small engine. A locomotive engine which gives a leak-down of 10% on a leak-down tester is virtually perfectly sealed while the same tester giving a 10% reading on a model airplane engine indicates a catastrophic leak. With a non-turbulent .040\\" orifice, and with a cylinder leakage effective orifice size of .040\\", leakage would be 50% at any pressure. At higher leakages the orifice can become turbulent, and this makes flow non-linear. Also, leakage paths in cylinders can be turbulent at fairly low flow rates. This makes leakage non- linear with test pressure. Further complicating things, nonstandard restriction orifice sizes will cause different indicated leakage percentages with the same cylinder leakage. Leak down testers are most accurate at low leakage levels, and the exact leakage reading is just a relative indication that can vary significantly between instruments. Some manufacturers use only a single gauge. In these instruments, the orifice inlet pressure is maintained automatically by the pressure regulator. A single gauge works well as long as leakage flow is much less than regulator flow. Any error in the input pressure will produce a corresponding error in the reading. As a single gauge instrument approaches 100% leakage, the leakage scale error reaches maximum. This may or may not induce significant error, depending on regulator flow and orifice flow. At low and modest leakage percentages, there is little or no difference between single and dual gauges. In instruments with two gauges the operator manually resets the pressure to 100 after connection to the engine guaranteeing consistent input pressure and greater accuracy. Most instruments use as the input pressure simply because ordinary 100psi gauges can be used which corresponds to 100% but there is no necessity for that pressure beyond that. Any pressure above will function just as well for measurement purposes although the sound of leaks will not be quite as loud. Besides leakage noise, indicated percentage of leakage will sometimes vary with regulator pressure and orifice size. With 100 psi and a .030\\" orifice, a given cylinder might show 20% leakage. At 50 psi, the same cylinder might show 30% leakage or 15% leakage with the same orifice. This happens because leakage flow is almost always very turbulent. Because of turbulence and other factors, such as seating pressures, test pressure changes almost always change the effective orifice formed by cylinder leakage paths. Metering orifice size has a direct effect on leakage percentage. Generally, a typical automotive engine pressurized to more than 30-40 psi must be locked or it will rotate under test pressure. The exact test pressure tolerated before rotation is highly dependent on connecting rod angle, bore, compression of other cylinders, and friction. There is less tendency to rotate when the piston is at top dead center, especially with small bore engines. Maximum tendency to rotate occurs at about half stroke, when the rod is at right angles to the crankshaft's throw. Due to the simple construction, many mechanics build their own testers. Homemade instruments can function as well as commercial testers, providing they employ proper orifice sizes, good pressure gauges, and good regulators.

It occupies the northern half of the Sagamore census-designated place. Along with Buzzards Bay and Bournedale, it is one of only three communities in Barnstable County that are north of the Cape Cod Canal. Sagamore Beach is largely a residential area with a small commercial district near the Sagamore Bridge and Massachusetts Route 3A. A central recreation area provides tennis courts and sports fields. Parking and access to the Cape Cod Canal service road are available on Canal Road. Sagamore Beach also adjoins Scusset Beach State Reservation. Recent development in the 2000s included a new post office, fire station, and several subdivisions. Early years When the Mayflower arrived in Plymouth just north of Sagamore Beach, there were about 30 Native American tribes in southeastern Massachusetts. The Wampanoag people were the principal tribe of this area. A heavily used trail crossed the area, which tribes used to reach the eastern reaches of Cape Cod. The trail, later widened by white settlers, became the main artery to Cape Cod and roughly followed what is now Massachusetts Route 6A. In honor of those who came before, titles used to name the streets and roads in Sagamore Beach include; Tecumseh, Siasconset, Sachem, Scusset, Manomet, Indian Trail, Indian Hill, and Fox Run. Sagamore and sachem are Native American leadership titles. Although initially a village of Sandwich, in 1884 Sandwich was divided to create the town of Bourne. The dredging for the Cape Cod Canal had already begun and Sagamore Beach became a village of Bourne. Although the area was settled by Europeans as early as 1637, the population greatly increased in 1905 when the Christian Endeavor Society founded a summer colony here. Victorian homes built on the bluffs in that era still grace the shoreline and the Sagamore Beach Colony Club established then continues as a community resource today.Sagamore Beach Colony Club website See also *Sagamore, Massachusetts References Category:Bourne, Massachusetts Category:Populated coastal places in Massachusetts Category:Villages in Barnstable County, Massachusetts Category:Villages in Massachusetts ","title":"Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts"},{"id":"7102669","text":"WETH may refer to: * WETH (FM), a radio station (94.3 FM) licensed to serve Harrisonburg, Louisiana, United States * WGMS (FM), a radio station (89.1 FM) licensed to serve Hagerstown, Maryland, United States, which held the call sign WETH from 1992 to 2007 ","title":"WETH"},{"id":"7102697","text":"Resonance2020 is a youth movement inspired by the ideologies of a book written by President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam called \\"Ignited Minds\\" with a vision of a developed India by 2020. :The youth is the answer to take our country forward.

Scozzafava was the Republican nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives in in a 2009 special election. She faced opposition from some Republican and conservative figures who deemed her too liberal to receive their support. While Scozzafava held an early lead in the polls, she later fell behind Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman and Democratic candidate Bill Owens and suspended her campaign shortly before the election; she then threw her support to Owens, the eventual winner. The election received significant national attention, and was alternately described as \\"a referendum on President Barack Obama\\" and \\"a fight over the identity of the Republican Party.\\"Hoffman concedes 23rd Congressional race to Owens , Associated Press, November 4, 2009 The race was also noteworthy due to the Tea Party movement influence on its outcome. A week after the 2009 election, Scozzafava was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the State Assembly. Scozzafava later announced that she would not seek re-election in 2010. In January 2011, Scozzafava was appointed as the New York Deputy Secretary of State for Local Government by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, a post she held until June 2016. She was later appointed as a Commissioner of the New York State Division of Tax Appeals Tribunal.

Political career Prior to her 1998 election to the State Assembly, Scozzafava served as a member of the Gouverneur Board of Trustees from 1989 to 1993 and was the Mayor of Gouverneur from 1993 to 1998. A liberal to moderate Republican during her Assembly tenure, Scozzafava supported abortion and same-sex marriage. She also had strong ties to organized labor. In agreement with most Republicans, Scozzafava opposed cap-and-trade and favored maintaining the Bush tax cuts.Jude Seymour \\"Scozzafava signs pledge not to raise income taxes\\", Watertown Daily Times, October 19, 2009.

Scozzafava considered running in a special election for the 48th state Senate district, which included most of the northwestern portion of her former Assembly district, in 2008. However, area Republicans chose Assemblyman William Barclay, in part because they thought Scozzafava would be seen as too socially liberal.Benjamin, Elizabeth. Democrats Fan The Flames Of Scozzafava's Tax Troubles. New York Daily News. July 22, 2009. Barclay lost the election to Democratic Assemblyman Darrel Aubertine, and some Republican operatives said that Scozzafava should have been the Republican candidate. In February 2008, Scozzafava was reportedly approached by Democrats about switching parties after she was passed over for the Republican nomination in the 48th Senate District special election. 2009 congressional race Scozzafava's husband, Ron McDougall, reportedly put out feelers to the Democrats about possible support for Scozzafava in a 2009 congressional race in New York's 23rd congressional district in the event that Democratic State Senator Darrel Aubertine opted not to seek the office; the seat was being vacated by John M. McHugh, who resigned upon Senate conformation as the new Secretary of the Army. On July 22, 2009, Scozzafava was chosen by the 11 Republican Party county chairs located in the 23rd Congressional district to be the Republican nominee for the special election to fill the vacancy in that district. The Conservative Party of New York State declined to support Scozzafava, who was described by Conservative Party Chairman Mike Long as a \\"nice lady who is too liberal\\"; instead, the Conservative Party nominated Doug Hoffman. Many notable Republicans, including former Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, endorsed Hoffman rather than Scozzafava because they deemed Scozzafava too liberal and ideologically indistinguishable from the Democratic candidate, Bill Owens.Palin: \\"there is no real difference between the Democrat and the Republican in this race.\\" Scozzafava had voted for same-sex marriage in the New York State Assembly, and she had also received an award from a Planned Parenthood affiliate in 2008. Scozzafava's political positions included support for \\"card check\\" legislation, support for federal funding for abortion, support for President Obama's 2009 stimulus package, and a refusal to rule out support for health care reform that included a \\"public option.\\" The Hoffman campaign ran television advertisements depicting Scozzafava and Owens as \\"two peas in a liberal pod.\\" Scozzafava's ties to Seaway Capital Partners (a firm which owed nearly $200,000 in back taxes and which was run by her brother) were questioned in connection with her 2009 run. She responded that she had had no direct ties to the company since 2007. Scozzafava received endorsements from former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Congressman Pete King (R-NY), the National Rifle Association (NRA), the Log Cabin Republicans, and the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT). A Siena College poll released on October 1, 2009 showed Scozzafava leading the race with 35% support, followed by Owens with 28%, and Hoffman with 16%. However, a Siena poll released two weeks later indicated that Owens led Scozzafava by four percentage points and Hoffman by 10%. After an October 31 poll showed Scozzafava trailing Hoffman by 15% and Owens by 16%, Scozzafava ended her campaign and released her supporters to \\"transfer their support as they [saw] fit.‚Äù The following day, Scozzafava endorsed Bill Owens, calling him \\"an independent voice who will put New York first.\\" This action put Scozzafava at odds with the Republican National Committee, which had backed Scozzafava prior to her withdrawal but had subsequently declared support for Hoffman. An article in The Politico stated that the White House had made a concerted effort to persuade Scozzafava to endorse Owens, dispatching Long Island Congressman Steve Israel, New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to request her support. At the meeting, Scozzafava reportedly told Cuomo that he would be \\"the next governor of New York.\\" According to the Watertown Daily Times, New York's senior U.S. Senator, Democrat Chuck Schumer, was also among those who lobbied Scozzafava for an endorsement of Owens. On Election Day, Bill Owens prevailed over Hoffman by a margin of 48.3% to 46%. Aftermath of 2009 congressional campaign After Scozzafava's unsuccessful congressional campaign, she acknowledged that her name had begun being used as a verb: \\"scozzafavaed.\\" Commentator Chris Good described the term as follows: \\"The gist, basically, is that if you're a moderate Republican and the conservative wing of the GOP sets out to get you, and does, you got Scozzafavaed.\\" Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage has used the term in a similar fashion: \\"We welcome everyone‚Äôs right to participate in the democratic process, but...[if] you try to elect pro-gay marriage Republicans, we will Dede Scozzafava them.\\" Also, conservative commentators, including Maggie Gallagher, have used the phrase \\"the Dede effect\\" to describe Republican lawmakers' fear of alienating their constituents by voting for same-sex marriage legislation. A week after the 2009 election, Scozzafava was stripped of her Republican leadership position in the New York State Assembly. Some observers speculated that Scozzafava might become an independent caucusing with the Democratic super-majority in the state Assembly, or that she might leave the Republican Party altogether and become a Democrat. During Scozzafava's November 1, 2009 meeting with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, Silver reportedly pledged that the Democrats would fully support Scozzafava should she decide to leave the GOP.

Biography Carpenter, born in Hopbottom township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, on March 6, 1894, attended grade schools in Scranton and high school in the Pittsburgh are industrial town of McKeesport. He was appointed a Midshipman from the 30th District of Pennsylvania on July 11, 1912. Graduating from the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, on June 2, 1916, ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Carpenter reported to his first ship, Wyoming (Battleship No. 32) on June 17. He was commissioned Ensign on July 5, 1916. Early career During his World War I service in Wyoming, Carpenter received temporary promotions to Lieutenant (junior grade) (Lt.JG) (October 3, 1917) and Lieutenant (February 6, 1918); permanent promotions to those ranks followed, on March 12, 1920 and March 31, 1921, respectively. Detached from Wyoming on May 16, 1921, Carpenter reported to Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, five days later, and over the ensuing months, helped fit out the new battleship California (BB-44). Detached from California on May 8, 1922, Carpenter was slated to join Nevada (BB-36) before her departure for the Atlantic coast, but received authorization to proceed to Pensacola, Florida, via commercial transportation, at his own expense, ‚Äúfor temporary duty under instruction in heavier-than-air craft.‚Äù Opting for flight training over continued service in battleships, Carpenter, authorized a month's delay in transit, reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola on June 19, 1922. Upon completion of flight training, Carpenter was detached from NAS Pensacola on April 3, 1923; he also married Clara Moreno the same day (a union that ultimately produced two sons). He reported for duty with Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, on April 27, 1923, and remained with that aeronautical organization until assigned temporary duty with Aircraft Squadrons, Scouting Fleet; he served with that unit until May 20, 1925. Commissioned Lieutenant Commander (LTCMDR) on February 5, 1927 while at Pensacola, Carpenter joined Stoddert (DD-302) on June 23, 1928 upon that destroyer's return from operations with the Battle Fleet in Hawaiian waters, and served as her executive officer until September 20, 1929. Naval Aviation Ordered to Langley (CV-1), he reported for duty the following day, and served in that aircraft carrier until June 30, 1930. Lt. Commander Donald M. Carpenter. US Navy Photo. Assuming command on June 30, 1930 of Scouting Squadron 3B (VS-3B), Aircraft Squadrons, Battle Fleet, which operated in the air group assigned to the aircraft carrier Lexington (CV-2), he remained in that billet through his squadron's being assigned to Carrier Divisions, U.S. Fleet, on October 25, 1930. Leaving VS-3B on April 25, 1931, Carpenter became executive officer (XO) of Fleet Air Base, Coco Solo, Canal Zone, on May 26, 1931, a billet he filled for almost two years, until relieved on July 19, 1933 to assume the post of operations officer for Aircraft Squadrons, Coco Solo. During the late summer of 1933, Carpenter commanded the ferry flight of the first division of Patrol Squadron 5F (VP-5F) from NAS Norfolk, Virginia to FAB Coco Solo. Carpenter flew 5-P-2, one of six Consolidated P2Y-1 flying boats that departed Norfolk mid-way through the first dog watch on September 7, 1933 (accompanied personally during the initial stages of the flight by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, in a Vought SU-1) and reached its destination, a little over halfway through the second dog watch the next day, having covered the 1,788 nautical miles (3,311 km) in a total elapsed time of 25 hours and 29 minutes. In the longest non-stop formation seaplane flight in history, the six flying boats battled headwinds for almost the entire aerial voyage, at one point encountering a heavy squall with velocity approaching 50 knots (90 km/h). Late career Detached from FAB Coco Solo on May 15, 1934, Carpenter reported on board seaplane tender Wright (AV-1) three days later, and became her navigator on May 30, 1934. He carried out those duties until hospitalized at the San Diego Naval Hospital, California, on November 20, 1934. Released the following spring, he served at NAS San Diego from April 11 to September 3, 1935 before he became Inspector of Naval Aircraft, San Diego, on the latter date. Detached on July 10, 1936 to the Training Division within the San Diego Naval Station, he was relieved of all active duty and placed on the retired list on October 1, 1936. Carpenter died of lobar pneumonia at the San Diego Naval Hospital on April 4, 1940. \\"Sincere respect\\" On June 18, 1945, Mrs. Edward S. Shaw, sister of Carpenter's widow Clara, wrote to Admiral King, then Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (who had commanded Lexington when Carpenter had commanded VS-3B) suggesting that a ship be named for the late leader of VP-5F's historic flight in 1933, citing the ‚Äúsincere respect‚Äù her brother-in-law had felt for King. ‚ÄúI sincerely hope you will not consider me presumptuous,‚Äù she wrote, ‚Äúbut if you could lend your approval to such an honor for 'Doc' as we all knew him, I would appreciate it very much.‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease do this if you can,‚Äù King wrote to the Chief of Naval Personnel, who recommended the name assignment on July 10, 1945; consequently, on July 14, 1945, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal assigned the name Carpenter to DD-825. In writing to Secretary Forrestal upon being informed of the naming of the ship, Carpenter's widow wrote on August 9, 1945 of her ‚Äúdeep appreciation of the honor bestowed on my two sons and me in the naming of this ship for my late husband and I hope her record will be one of which to be proud‚Ä¶‚Äù USS Carpenter US Navy Photo of the USS Carpenter in heavy Seas off Australia.

They were used on several nearby clusters in the first half of the 1900s to determine distance. The moving-cluster method is now largely superseded by other, usually more accurate distance measures. Introduction The moving-cluster method relies on observing the proper motions and Doppler shift of each member of a group of stars known to form a cluster. The idea is that since all the stars share a common space velocity, they will appear to move towards a point of common convergence (\\"vanishing point\\") on the sky. This is essentially a perspective effect. Using the moving-cluster method, the distance to a given star cluster (in parsecs) can be determined using the following equation: :\\\\mathrm{distance} = \\\\mathrm{tan}(\\\\theta) \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{v}} {\\\\mathrm{\\\\mu}} where \\"Œ∏\\" is the angle between the star and the cluster's apparent convergence point, \\"Œº\\" is the proper motion of the cluster (in arcsec/year), and \\"v\\" is the star's radial velocity (in AU/year). Usage The method has only ever been used for a small number of clusters. This is because for the method to work, the cluster must be quite close to Earth (within a few hundred parsecs), and also be fairly tightly bound so it can be made out on the sky. Also, the method is quite difficult to work with compared with more straightforward methods like trigonometric parallax. Finally, the uncertainty in the final distance values are in general fairly large compared those obtained with precision measurements like those from Hipparcos. Of the clusters it has been used with, certainly the most famous are the Hyades and the Pleiades. The moving-cluster method was in fact the only way astronomers had to measure the distance to these clusters with any precision for some time in the early 20th century. Because of the problems outlined above, this method has not been used practically for stars for several decades in astronomical research. However, recently it has been used to estimate the distance between the brown dwarf 2M1207 and its observed exoplanet 2M1207b. In December 2005, American astronomer Eric Mamajek reported a distance (53 ¬± 6 parsecs) to 2M1207b using the moving-cluster method.

Wilkinson was the son of Charles Wilkinson of Boroughbridge and his wife Deborah Cholmley, daughter of Richard Cholmley of Bramham, Yorkshire.He was admitted at Clare College, Cambridge on 2 July 1715 and at the Middle Temple on 8 July 1719. He married Barbara Jessop, daughter of William Jessop of Broom Hall near Sheffield on 2 September 1723. Wilkinson's father was the Yorkshire estate agent of successive Dukes of Newcastle, and from 1718 was the receiver-general of the land tax for Yorkshire, Northumberland and Durham until he resigned in 1727. Wilkinson then became receiver of the land tax for West Rising. Shortly afterwards it was discovered that Wilkinson's father was in debt to the Government for over ¬£30,000 and consequently spent the rest of his life as a crown debtor in Newgate prison. Wilkinson's own position as receiver was in jeopardy until his father-in-law Jessop offered to stand surety for him. Wilkinson was invited to stand for parliament at Boroughbridge at the 1734 British general election, but the Duke of Newcastle advised him to wait until Aldborough became available. When his father-in-law WIlliam Jessop died in 1735, Wilkinson gave up his post as receiver and was returned as Member of Parliament for Aldborough at a by-election on 19 February 1735. He was returned unopposed as MP for Aldborough at the 1741 British general election and was awarded the post of Clerk of Deliveries in the Ordnance in May 1741. In 1746 he was promoted to Storekeeper of the Ordnance and was re-elected to parliament on the consequential parliament on 23 April 1746. He was returned unopposed again at the 1747 British general election. Wilkinson continued to act as Newcastle's estate agent and electoral manager for Yorkshire and was returned unopposed again for Aldborough in 1754 and 1761. However, he voted against the Government on the peace preliminaries in December 1762 and as a result was dismissed from his post at the Ordnance. He was restored to the post in September 1765, but had to give up his parliamentary seat and was unable to recontest it because it was required for Viscount Villiers. Wilkinson applied to the Duke of Newcastle to be returned to Parliament again and was returned for Aldborough at the 1768 British general election. He was absent for many votes and resigned his seat in May 1772 by applying for the post of Steward of the Manor of East Hendred. Wilkinson died on 29 March 1784, leaving seven sons. Broom Hall was left to his eldest son, Rev. James Wilkinson. His third son, also named Andrew, became a captain in the Royal Navy.

He landed on the island of Montserrat and right in the middle of an arms deal that went very sour. Before he knew it, he was wounded, running through the jungle with a suitcase full of nuclear arming codes. He happened upon a young girl named Toots and found not only a friend, but a person deserving of his protection and devotion. : Little is known about Saxon's past, or the purpose of his team. It is known that the team was known as the Zealots, as he still wears their shoulder patch. Admiral Belter of the United States Navy referenced the Zealots in connection with an 'Operation Ithaca,' which may have been in connection with the mysterious group known as Elysium, which created the Neptune submarine. : He was married at one point to a woman named Michelle, who divorced him when he joined the military, and his remaining feelings for her have often gotten in the way of his growing feelings for Toots. He has a love for Ding-Dongs. Near the end of the War miniseries, he was caught in a grenade explosion and presumably killed. His death was confirmed in the field by Nigel Thomas, who attempted to carry his body back to Toots aboard the Sappho 3. His body is currently missing after being swept away by flood waters on the island of St. Maarten. Toots : A bright, energetic girl who finds herself as a sort of trophy for an unsavory gunrunner named Vinnie. Her predicament is unexpectedly resolved when Jed kills Vinnie. She is immediately smitten with the young soldier's naive but profound sense of morality and his genuine kindness. : It is known that Toots's real name is Catherine Michelle Wolf, and she was born in 1983. During her life, she has followed numerous professions, including modeling and singing. She fancies herself to be a chef, but her cooking seems to rival that of Akane Tendo in toxicity. Richard Goldman - Israeli Special Forces : Survivor of a doomed Israeli operation to the Caribbean, Richard shares Jed's conviction that the Nationalists must be stopped at all costs. Forced to escape an armada of Nationalist ships and planes, Richard is now aboard the submarine Neptune, a leftover engine of technology designed by Elysium. Melissa Duvall - Genetic Engineer : A year prior to the story, Melissa escaped from Elysium, where her scientific skills had been exploited and perverted. She was captured by the Nationalists and eventually rescued by Jed and Richard. Until recently, she believed Elysium was no more, but the discovery of the submarine Neptune has made her suspect that the organization has survived. She has escaped the Nationalists again, along with Richard, aboard Neptune. She carries the secrets of Elysium. Nigel Thomas - British Special Forces : When England was essentially destroyed, Nigel decided he'd had enough. He fled the war after serving with distinction in Iraq and Iran. He managed to buy his way aboard a cargo ship with treasure liberated from the Republican Guard of Iraq, then sailed to a small island between St. Lucia and Barbados. He believed he'd found the perfect place to live, but Jed and company brought the Nationalists down on his island paradise, and he was forced to flee with them.

(2005). \\"Yamato monogatari\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 1047. It is an uta monogatari (a work combining narrative fiction with waka poetry) from the 10th-century Japan. The exact date of the completion of the text is unknown, but the majority of the text was completed in the year 951 by an unknown author. Content The Ise Monogatari had a strong influence on the composition of Yamato Monogatari, one that can be seen in the fact that some of the same tales appear in both works. The appearance of many historical figures and the absence of a single main character are characteristics of this text.  Origin  The poems in Yamato Monogatari were written in a time when Japanese literature and art was flourishing, after having stopped communications with China. Deciding that the declining Tang Dynasty was no longer worth communicating with, Japan became increasingly more conscious of its own culture through literary and artistic works such as poetry. During the early ninth century, nearly all literary works were Chinese, but by the end of the 10th century, nearly all the best literary works were done purely in Japanese. In addition, waka poetry was becoming more popular as opposed to classical Chinese poetry, even though at first it was as if Japanese styled poetry had never existed. At the beginning of the Heian period, waka poetry was almost never practiced due to the popularity of Chinese poetry. It was at its lowest point in history some time between 800 ‚Äì 850. Waka poetry did not begin to rise in popularity until 850 ‚Äì 890, where it was revived by a group of six poets who would be later known as the Six Poetic Geniuses. At the same time, waka poetry was also being used in many court activities such as poetry contests. In 951, the establishment of the wakadokoro, or Poetry Bureau, and the compilation of the Gosen Wakash≈´ helped to promote the creation of poems and poem anthologies such as Yamato Monogatari. At the same time, the development of the kana system of writing also helped to further Japanese literature by presenting a way through which Japanese phonetics may be written and read. It was with this writing system that the many tales and poems of Yamato Monogatari were written. From Yamato Monogatari, we are able to see what kind of life the Fujiwara court nobles and officials lived. Enjoying luxury and wielding influence, the lifestyle of the Fujiwara nobility was one informed by the aesthetics of courtliness (miyabi) and taste (fuuryuu). This helped fuel the writing style and poetry for that period of time. Poetry played a major role in their lives: acting as a pastime, and helping record the events of their daily lives. Leisure hours were spent gossiping about well-known poets and discussing the circumstances of which poems would be composed, even reminiscing about familiar poems. It was only inevitable to see that collections of these poems began to be created, one of them being Yamato Monogatari.  Structure  The Yamato Monogatari as we know it today is a collection of 334 waka poems in 173 episodes. However, the original text only contains less than 300 waka poems in 172 episodes. This extra episode, along with two extra sections, was added some time after the compiling of the original text to form the Yamato Monogatari that we know today. The poems of Yamato Monogatari can be roughly divided into two distinct parts: the first half being composed of solely waka poems about actual historical figures. 140 of these 173 episodes describe the lives of those who lived in the court circle. Over 100 different people were mentioned in Yamato Monogatari; 80 are mentioned by a name, while the rest are only referred to by their court titles. It is difficult to be able to recognize one noble from another because of the sheer number of them that are mentioned. However, it is clear that the writers of these poems were eager to know about the details of the private lives of these people. The second half contains legends and stories told in a more literary and prose style. The sections in this prose half of Yamato Monogatari are much longer and descriptive. These legends have gone on to inspire many writers throughout Japan‚Äôs history, even some authors as recent as 50 years ago.

It has been disputed by a number of historians. Books that emphasize quilt use In Stitched from the Soul (1990), Gladys-Marie Fry asserted that quilts were used to communicate safe houses and other information about the Underground Railroad, which was a network through the United States and into Canada of \\"conductors\\", meeting places, and safe houses for the passage of African Americans out of slavery. The theory that quilts and songs were used to communicate information about the Underground Railroad, though is disputed among historians. Even so, escaping slavery was generally an act of \\"complex, sophisticated and covert systems of planning\\". The 1999 book Hidden in Plain View, by Raymond Dobard, Jr., an art historian, and Jacqueline Tobin, a college instructor in Colorado, explores how quilts were used to communicate information about the Underground Railroad. The idea for the book came from Ozella McDaniel Williams who told Tobin that her family had passed down a story for generations about how patterns like wagon wheels, log cabins, and wrenches were used in quilts to navigate the Underground Railroad. Williams stated that the quilts had ten squares, each with a message about how to successfully escape. It started with a monkey wrench, that meant to gather up necessary supplies and tools, and ended with a star, which meant to head north. The book claims that there was a quilt code that conveyed messages in counted knots and quilt block shapes, colors and names. In a 2007 Time magazine article, Tobin stated: \\"It's frustrating to be attacked and not allowed to celebrate this amazing oral story of one family's experience. Whether or not it's completely valid, I have no idea, but it makes sense with the amount of research we did.\\" Dobard said, \\"I would say there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about the code. In the book Jackie and I set out to say it was a set of directives. It was a beginning, not an end-all, to stir people to think and share those stories.\\" He called the book \\"informed conjecture, as opposed to a well-documented book with a \\"wealth of evidence\\". Even though the book tells the story from the perspective of one family, folk art expert Maud Wahlman believes that it is possible that the hypothesis is true. \\"There‚Äôs a tradition in Africa where coding things is controlled by secret societies. If you want to learn the deeper meaning of symbols, then you need to show worthiness of knowing these deeper meanings by not telling anyone,\\" she said. Wahlman wrote the foreword for Hidden in Plain View. Response Giles Wright, an Underground Railroad expert, asserts that the book is based upon folklore that is unsubstantiated by other sources. He also said that there are no memoirs, diaries, or Works Progress Administration interviews conducted in the 1930s of ex-slaves that mention quilting codes. Quilt historians Kris Driessen, Barbara Brackman, and Kimberly Wulfert do not believe the theory that quilts were used to communicate messages about the Underground Railroad. Controversy in the hypothesis became more intense in 2007 when plans for a sculpture of Frederick Douglass at a corner of Central Park called for a huge quilt in granite to be placed in the ground to symbolize the manner in which slaves were aided along the Underground Railroad. Noted historians did not believe that the hypothesis was true and saw no connection between Douglass and this belief. Civil War historian David W. Blight, said \\"At some point the real stories of fugitive slave escape, as well as the much larger story of those slaves who never could escape, must take over as a teaching priority. It ought to be rooted in real and important aspects of his life and thought, not a piece of folklore largely invented in the 1990s which only reinforces a soft, happier version of the history of slavery that distracts us from facing harsher truths and a more compelling past.\\" Fergus Bordewich, the author of Bound for Canaan: The Underground Railroad and the War for the Soul of America, calls it \\"fake history\\", based upon the mistaken premise that the Underground Railroad activities \\"were so secret that the truth is essentially unknowable\\". He says that most of the people who successfully escaped slavery were \\"enterprising and well informed.\\" Even so, there are museums, schools, and others who believe the story to be true. An education coordinator at the Plymouth Historical Museum in Michigan, Anna Lopez said to Time, \\"What I tell kids is, who writes history? Men do. Mostly white men. Then I ask, who made quilts? Women did, and a lot of black women made quilts and passed on their oral history. No one wrote down their history, so who knows?\\" John Reddick, who worked on the Douglass sculpture project for Central Park, states that it is paradoxical that historians require written evidence of slaves who were not allowed to read and write. He likens the coding of the quilts to the language in Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, in which slaves meant escaping but their masters thought was about dying.

Biography Early life Ma was born in Gongzhuling, in Jilin province, to a poor shepherding family. At the age of 20, he became a security guard of Huaide County. For his exceptional marksmanship and equestrianism, he was promoted to Guard Monitor of the 4th Security Guard Battalion by Wu Junsheng, Commander of Tianhou Road Patrol and Defense Battalion of Mukden, in 1908. According to some western sources, Ma Zhanshan was born in Liaoning in 1887. However, most claim 1885 as his birth year. He was of Manchu heritage and his grandson Ma Zhiwei, a member of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, mentioned the Manchu ethnicity of the family in his official biography and news report as well. There are also resources which said Ma Zhanshan was a Chinese Muslim and his Muslim name was Muazzam Husain. In 1913, Ma was appointed as Major and Company Commander of 3rd Company, 3rd Regiment, 2nd Brigade of the Central Cavalry Army in the Army of the Republic of China. In 1920, he was promoted to colonel and followed his patron, warlord Wu Junsheng. He started his military career in Zhang Zuolin's Northeastern Army, serving as a brigade commander of 5th Cavalry Brigade, 17th Cavalry Division, then as brigadier of 3rd Infantry Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army. After Zhang's death in 1928, Ma was nominated as Heilongjiang Provincial Bandit Suppression Commander, and Heilongjiang Provincial Cavalry Commander-in-chief in 1928. While British diplomatic documents described him as one of the \\"bandit\\" military men who received no training and did not receive instruction, he was a master sharpshooter and equestrian. Japanese Invasion of Manchuria After the Mukden Incident, when the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, Governor Wan Fulin of Heilongjiang Province was in Beijing, leaving no one in authority in the province to take charge of defenses against the Japanese. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the Nanjing Government to ask for instructions, and then appointed Ma Zhanshan to act as Governor and Military Commander-in-chief of Heilongjiang Province on October 10, 1931. Ma arrived in the capital Qiqihar on October 19 and took office the next day. He held military meetings and personally inspected the defense positions while facing down parties advocating surrender, saying ‚ÄúI am appointed as Chairman of the province, and I have the responsibility to defend the province and I will never be a surrendering general‚Äù. Ma became famous around the world after the incident. The Japanese invaders repeatedly demanded to repair the Nen River Bridge, which had been dynamited in earlier civil strife to prevent an advance by a rival Chinese warlord. These demands were refused by Ma Zhanshan. The Japanese, determined to repair the bridge, sent a repair crew, guarded by 800 Japanese soldiers. Nearby were 2,500 Chinese troops, and the Battle of Nenjiang Bridge ensued. Each side charged the other with opening fire without provocation, and thus began the Jiangqiao Campaign. Although eventually forced to withdraw his troops in the face of Japanese tanks and artillery, Ma became a national hero for his resistance to the Japanese, which was reported in the Chinese and international press. Ting Chao and other senior commanders followed Ma's example at the industrial city of Harbin in Jilin province and elsewhere, and his successes inspired the local Chinese to aid or enlist in his forces. On November 18, Ma evacuated Qiqihar. However, after the General Ting Chao was driven from Harbin, Ma's forces suffered serious casualties and were soon driven over the Soviet border. Ma appealed in a telegram to the League of Nations asking for help against the Japanese. $2,000 were cabled by Chinese in America to Ma to help him fight. Manchukuo Because of his fame and heroics efforts in resisting the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Colonel Kenji Doihara offered Ma Zhanshan a huge sum of $3,000,000 in gold to defect to the new Manchukuo Imperial Army. Ma agreed, and offered to tour the country to reconcile the local inhabitants to the new government. He flew to Shenyang in January 1932, where he attended the meeting that founded the puppet state of Manchukuo. Ma was ill at the time, and avoided the signing of the Independence Declaration of Manchukuo. He attended the inaugural ceremony of Pu Yi as Regent of Manchukuo in March the same year, and was appointed as War Minister of Manchukuo and Governor of Heilongjiang Province under the new government. However, the Japanese did not fully trust Ma (as with other Manchukuo officials), and he had to ask approval from his Japanese advisor about all matters of the province before taking any actions. General Ma had secretly decided to rebel against the Japanese after his \\"defection\\", using large amounts of Japanese money to raise and re-equip his new volunteer force with munitions. He secretly transported weapons and ammunition out of the arsenals, and evacuated the wives and families of his troops to safety. On April 1, 1932, he led his troops from Qiqihar, supposedly on a tour of inspection. However, at Heihe on April 7, he announced the reestablishment of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and his independence from Manchukuo. Ma reorganized his troops into 9 brigades at the beginning of May, and then he established another 11 troops of volunteers at Buxi, Gannan, Keshan, Kedong, and other places. This force was styled the ‚ÄúNortheast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army‚Äù. Ma appointed himself as nominal Commander-in-chief and absorbed the other volunteer armies in the region, commanding a total fighting force of about 300,000 men at its peak strength. The units under Ma undertook ambushes along the major roads and badly weakened Manchukuo and Japanese troops in several engagements. In the ‚ÄúMa Chan-shan Subjugation Operation‚Äù, the Kwantung Army transferred a large mixed force of Japanese and Manchukuo troops to encircle and destroy Ma's Army. Ma Zhanshan's troops, though seriously depleted from previous battles, escaped due to the laxity of the Manchukuo troops. In September, Ma Zhanshan arrived in Longmen County and established a relationship with the Heilungkiang National Salvation Army of Su Bingwen. In the ‚ÄúSu Ping-wei Subjugation Operation‚Äù, 30,000 Japanese and Manchukuo troops forced Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen to retreat across the border into the Soviet Union in December. Most of these troops were then transferred to Rehe. General Ma Zhanshan commanded 3,500 guerilla fighters against the Japanese, conducting attacks such as a raid on the Manchukuo treasury, attacking Changchun, the capital, and hijacking six Japanese planes from an airfield. General Ma caused so much trouble to the Japanese that when his equipment and horse were captured, the Japanese presented them to the Emperor in Tokyo, assuming that he was dead. They were enraged to discover that he had survived and escaped. The China monthly review reported that \\"the persistence with which the Japanese telegrams reiterate and insist that General Ma Chan-san is dead is little short of comical\\". The Japanese, over the course of several months, continuously invented different versions of how Ma Zhanshan allegedly \\"died\\". After General Ma escaped, his men kept up the fight against the Japanese occupying forces. They seized 350 Japanese and Korean hostages and held them for weeks and kidnapped foreigners such as the son of a British general and an American executive's wife. Second Sino- Japanese War Ma himself stayed abroad in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy, only returning in June 1933. Ma Zhanshan was allegedly one of the commanders of the Soviet army during the Xinjiang War (1937), during which he fought against the fellow Muslim General Ma Hushan. It was reported that he led Russian troops disguised in Chinese uniforms along with bombers during the attack, which was requested by Sheng Shicai. Other sources do not mention this doubtful participation of Ma Zhanshan in this war, since he was a Commander in Chief of Cavalry in the National Revolutionary Army in China in 1937. He went to Chiang Kai-shek ask for armies to fight against the Japanese but was refused assistance. Ma then settled in Tianjin until October 1936 when Chiang Kai-shek suddenly sent him to the front of the Chinese Civil War. At Xi'an at the time of Xian Incident, he suggested to Zhang Xueliang not to kill Chiang Kai-shek while the country was in trouble and signed on the ‚ÄúCurrent Political Situation Declaration‚Äù issued by Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng. Zhang Xueliang appointed Ma Zhanshan as the Commander-in-chief of the ‚ÄúAnti-Japanese Aid Suiyuan Cavalry Group Army‚Äù, which was suspended afterwards when Zhang Xueliang was detained by Chiang Kai-shek. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Zhanshan was appointed as Commander of the Northeastern Advance Force, in charge of the four northeastern provinces Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Rehe. Ma Zhanshan established a headquarters in Datong in August 1937, led his troops to fight the Japanese in Chahar, Suiyuan Datong and Shanxi, and cooperated with Fu Zuoyi's troops in the defense of Suiyuan and in the Yinshan War. Ma Zhanshan abhorred the nonresistance policy of the Kuomintang government and he sided with the Chinese Communist Party in its anti-Japanese policy. He visited Yan'an in 1939 in order reach an accommodation with the Eighth Route Army. Ma Zhanshan was appointed as Chairman of the Provisional Government of Heilongjiang in August 1940 by the Chinese Communist Party, and held that title in secret to the end of the war. Post-War After the defeat of Japan, the Kuomintang government appointed Ma Zhanshan as Northeast Deputy Security Commander. He took office in Shenyang, but a half year later he retired to his home in Beijing saying he was ill. He crossed over to the Communist Party in January 1949 after persuading General Fu Zuoyi to allow the city to be peacefully transferred to the Communists. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Mao Zedong invited him to attend the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in June 1950, but he failed to attend because of illness and he died the same year on November 29 in Beijing.

WIFT is owned and operated by Kristin Cantrell, through licensee Southern Belle, LLC. History For many years, the then-WOWQ had been the sister station of WCED, also licensed to DuBois. The station made its debut seven years after WCED first signed on. Like many FM stations that were part of an AM portfolio, this station made its debut as WCED-FM, simulcasting its AM sister for portions of the broadcast day, separating for a period during the day as part of a 1965 FCC mandate requiring combination AM/FM licensees to originate separate programming for at least half of the broadcast day. In 1981, the separate-programming rule was repealed by the FCC, but WCED-FM went the opposing direction and adopted the call letters WOWQ and the moniker Q102, becoming a fully independent station with its own programming. It began this identity initially with a Top 40 format, mostly automated. By 1988, the station had switched its format from Top 40 to Country, and began putting live local DJs on during the daytime hours, with a satellite-delivered country music format programmed offsite from another location during the evening hours. Though the format had changed, the Q102 moniker was retained. It was at this time that the station had begun pretty much what it is today. WOWQ and WCED were also two of the very first stations in the U.S. to use hard-disk audio storage technology in the early 1990s, developed by Computer Concepts Corporation. Sale to Vox Media Tri-County Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Oil City, PA-based Derrick Publishing (which publishes the Oil City Derrick and the Clarion News daily newspapers), had owned WCED and WOWQ since its inception in 1948. Company president E. Michael Boyle decided to sell both stations to Vox Media in 1999. Upon acquisition, Vox Media changed WOWQ's call letters to WMOU-FM in December 2000 and adopted the moniker \\"Moo 102\\", though it maintained the popular country music format. The move was made to presumably create the same top-of-mind-recall generated by its competitors in Altoona, whose stations were branded as \\"Froggy\\". Vox Media then decided to put both WOWQ and WCED up for sale, with WOWQ being sold in October 2001 to First Media Radio, LLC, for $4.2 million. WCED would be spun off to another owner five years later. Q102 returns Shortly after the acquisition by First Media, the station reverted to the Q102 moniker and moved out of its longtime home at 80 North Park Place on the outskirts of DuBois. The station then moved to a new building shared with the DuBois news office of Johnstown NBC affiliate WJAC-TV, where it remains today. Effective January 3, 2017, First Media sold WIFT, WCPA, WQYX, WZDB, and WZDD to Southern Belle, LLC for $4.5 million. Bigfoot Country On May 30, 2017, WOWQ rebranded as \\"Bigfoot Country 102.1 & 101.3\\" (simulcast on WKFT 101.3 FM Strattanvile) under new WIFT calls.Seven Mountains Media Shuffles Northern PA Formats Radioinsight - May 31, 2017 Weekday programming *12 a.m. to 5 a.m.- Blair Garner Overnight *5 a.m. to 6 a.m.- Bigfoot Country *6 a.m. to 10 a.m.- The Bigfoot Family Show with Scott and Julie Squatch *10 a.m. to 3 p.m.- Jay Paul Yeti *3 p.m. to 7 p.m.- Harry Mann *7p.m. to 12 a.m.- The Lia Show Saturday Programming *12 a.m. to 5 a.m.- Blair Garner Overnight *5 a.m. to 6 a.m.- Bigfoot Country *6 a.m. to 8 a.m.- Thunder Road *8 a.m. to 10 a.m.- Retro Country USA *10 a.m. to 7 p.m.- Bigfoot Country *7 a.m. to 12 a.m.- Red Cup Country Sunday Programming *12 a.m. to 5 a.m.- Blair Garner Overnight *5 a.m. to 9 a.m.- Crook and Chase Top Country Countdown *9 a.m. to 12 p.m.- Bigfoot Polka Party *12 p.m. to 7 p.m.- Bigfoot Country *7 p.m. to 10 p.m.- Honky Tonkin' with Tracy Lawrence *10 p.m. to 12 a.m.- Bigfoot Country On- air Weekdays * Tom Howard * Scott Ryan * Courtney Paige * Scott Keen * Lia Knight Weekends * Brian Folmar * Krista * Moose Rosana Previous logo 200px References External links *Bigfoot Country Online * IFT Category:Country radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"WIFT"},{"id":"7103223","text":"Litmus is a web-based, open source, test case management/QA tool, previously maintained by the Mozilla Corporation/Mozilla Foundation.

This species has the large size, white horseshoe-shaped underside-marking, and the subtly-needled tail typical of the needletails. Compared to other needletails, it is extremely dark and is the only one without a pale throat patch. Few detailed descriptions of the life history of the purple needletail are known. It is a gregarious species, probably never leaving a group of at least 20 birds. The large size of these swifts is said to be apparent even from a distance. It is believed to take any kind of large, flying insect; sometimes even hanging around bee-farms to pick off members of a hive. The breeding habits are unknown, although it is thought that this is a cave- nesting bird. The voice is also unknown. The commonality of this species is not really known.

Not designed for Nintendo platforms, the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo's decision not to have Philips create a CD add-on to the Super NES. During these negotiations, Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD-i third-party developer games. The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10, 1993, and Zelda's Adventure was developed by Viridis and was released in North America on June 5, 1994. The games were given little funding or development time, and Nintendo provided only cursory input. None of the games are canonical to the Zelda franchise. CD-i players did not sell well and the games saw relatively small sales figures. Though the games initially received largely positive reviews,ECTS 93: CDi Philips - Link: The Faces of Evil. Joystick.

This is attributed to the reaction of many gamers to the obscure games' full motion video cutscenes when they first became widely available through video-sharing websites such as YouTube. The cutscenes are perceived to be of poor quality. Because the aging early 1990s visual effects of the titles failed to live up to the graphic effects of the 2000s, and because for many fans this was their first experience of the games, the CD-i Zelda titles have developed a critical reputation as particularly poor based largely on animation quality and to an extent awkward controls. In the eyes of \\"devout\\" hardcore gamers, according to Edge, the games are now considered \\"tantamount to blasphemy\\".Development Hell. Edge. No.120. Pg.81. February 2003. Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon are played using the side- scrolling view introduced in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, while Zelda's Adventure has a top-down view reminiscent of the original The Legend of Zelda. All the CD-i Zelda games begin with animated FMVs to illustrate the capabilities of the CD-ROM format, save Zelda's Adventure, which begins with a live-action video. History In 1989, Nintendo signed a deal with Sony to begin development of a CD-ROM-based system known as the SNES-CD (also known as the \\"Nintendo Play-Station\\", with separated words) to be an add-on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that would allow for FMV and larger games. However, Nintendo broke the agreement and instead signed with Philips to make the add-on, which caused Sony to spin off their add-on into its own console called the PlayStation (with \\"PlayStation\\" as one word due to a copyright issue with the trademark \\"Play-Station\\" owned by Nintendo). Witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega-CD, Nintendo scrapped the idea of making an add-on entirely. As part of dissolving the agreement with Philips, Nintendo gave them the license to use five of their characters, including Link, Princess Zelda, and Ganon, for games on Philips's console called the CD-i, after the partnership's dissolution. Contracting out to independent studios, Philips subsequently used the characters to create three games for the CD-i, with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on the look of the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets.The Making of... Zelda: 'Wand of Gamelon' & 'Link: Faces of Evil'. Retro Gamer. Issue 27. p. 52-57. August 2006. Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD-i's capabilities including FMV, high-resolution graphics, and CD-quality music. Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console, there were several technical limitations, such as laggy controls (especially for the standard infrared controller), and numerous problems in streaming-audio, memory, disc access, and graphics. The first two games were showcased at the 1993 CES and surprised audiences with their degree of animation.Rodrigues, Iara, ed. \\"Game Plus: Multim√≠dia - Zelda Ataca CDI\\". GamePower. No.16. Pg.45. October 1993. All the CD-i games in The Legend of Zelda series were released after Link's Awakening but before Ocarina of Time, as illustrated in the timeline with the relevant games marked with asterisks. Video games  Link: The Faces of Evil  Paired with Zelda: Wand of Gamelon in a simultaneous release, Link: The Faces of Evil represents the first of the Zelda games to be released by Philips for the CD-i. Following the traditional Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Faces of Evil was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The game broke new ground in the video game industry by using outsourced Russian animation to create all cutscenes, and the game received largely positive contemporary reception.CD TESTS: Link The Faces of Evil. Joystick. No.44. Pg.192. December 1993. Modern criticism is almost universal in its harsh negativity toward the game and the animated cutscenes have become particular targets of derision. Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon Reversing the traditional Link-saves-Zelda plotline, Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link and her father the king who have not returned from their quest. As with Faces of Evil, the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo's previous side-scroller, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes. Despite the game's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil, modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability to live up to modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception. Zelda's Adventure Released nearly 8 months after the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a different third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews of the first two games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.

A typical patch cut might be 2-3 tree lengths. Below a certain size, seedling regeneration advantage shifts from the shade intolerant species favored in clearcuts to the shade tolerant species favored by selection harvests. An areas of patch cuts of different shapes were tried in the Northern hemisphere to see where shade tolerant and shade intolerant species might regenerate. It was found in small patches (1/10 acre) N. 44¬∞ that there was a limited solar exposure of only a few hours (3-4) and this would lead to strongly shade tolerant and moderately shade tolerant trees dominating over time. Yet at slightly larger (1/2 acre) patches much more sunlight for longer was reaching the forest floor. This would warm the floor more, increase nutrient release and thus more light demanding species could grow faster and might then reach maturity in the stand.Patterns of light and shade in clearcut openings of two shapes and sizes, Marquis D.A. US Forestry Service Research Report NE-39 1965 As well as light other factors to be considered are wind to avoid windthrow, pathogens and fire risk. Positive benefits can also be gained if patches keep horizontal biodiversity in a forest stand and for an owner with not so much forest this may be useful for keeping non-timber forest products in usable amounts. Patch cuts can have less visual impact than clearcuts, and can mimic some stand disturbance processes. Patch cuts can also be simpler to implement than trying to selectively log individual trees within a selection cut. Patch cuts are distinct from the group selection method. A patch would pick several trees to be big enough to allow regeneration of a specific species, perhaps that has problems growing due to shade intolerance or another factor, as several together. Whereas a group would be only a few mature trees (3-5) and would not necessarily favor a shade intolerant species to establish into a group. In a patch the edge effect would be overcome but in a group most likely not.Silviculture: Concepts and Applications 2nd Edition by Ralph D.

Description Cobblestones on the Grandview Trail. The trail begins at the north end of the Grandview Point parking area, off of Arizona state route 64, east of Grand Canyon Village, Arizona. From the trail head, it makes a quick descent through the Kaibab Limestone and Toroweap Formation, making a couple of early switchbacks. Portions of this section of trail were reconstructed in the summer of 2005 after a couple of storms washed them out. The trail generally follows the western side of the ridge that extends northeast of Grandview Point which marks a natural break in the Coconino Sandstone. The trail turns to the north and makes a final descent through the Hermit Shale and Supai Group until it reaches Horseshoe Mesa, from the trail head, after a descent of . Camping is allowed on the mesa in designated areas on its eastern side and by permit only. Permits are issued by the Backcountry Information Center. Signage on trail indicates the locations of the campsites. Composting toilets have been installed, but no water is available on the mesa. The trail splits on Horseshoe Mesa near the Last Chance Mine. A spur trail leads east down a break in the Redwall Limestone on the eastern side of the mesa close to the rim. The spur trail is steep, leading past Miners Spring which is the nearest water source for camping on Horseshoe Mesa. The end of this spur is about from the Grandview trail head at a junction with the Tonto Trail and leads to the head of Hance Canyon, a perennial water source and alternate camping area. To the west of Last Chance Mine, a western spur from the Grandview Trail cuts through a break in the Redwall Limestone and descends the western side of the mesa following Cottonwood Creek. Water taken from this source must be filtered, treated, or boiled before consuming. The Grandview Trail follows the west side of a small butte that caps the mesa. It leads to the northern end of the mesa, and then descends between the two arms of the mesa to a junction with the Tonto Trail. From this point, the east branch doubles back toward Hance Canyon, and the west branch leads to Cottonwood Creek.

Monk was born in Northumberland before the Victorian era (although the stories take place under Victoria), the son of a fisherman. Before he joined the police, Monk worked as a banker under Arroll Dundas, who became Monk's mentor and taught him how to behave and dress like a gentleman. When Dundas was wrongly convicted of railway fraud, Monk decided he would never again be so powerless against injustice and became a policeman. He was ruthlessly ambitious and quickly climbed the career ladder‚Äîwhile making many enemies along the way. He had a coach accident in 1856, after which he lost his memory‚Äîa fact he kept secret to save his job. After the accident he met Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse and they became close. Only Latterly knew about Monk's memory issues. In the second book, A Dangerous Mourning, Monk was fired from the police force for insubordination and became a private investigator. Lady Callandra Daviott (Hester's best friend) financed his private investigations. Sir Oliver Rathbone was his love rival (he too wanted to marry Hester) and judicial adviser in his case. In \\"Dark Assassin,\\" Monk joined the Thames River Police to pay a debt to a friend who died on a previous case. Although he finds the shift from street policing to river policing difficult, he earns the respect of his men and continues on in this position.  Personality  William Monk is a clever man who wields irony and sarcasm with considerable skill while remaining obstinate, proud, and impulsive. This normally disastrous combination of attributes (for which he was dismissed from the police force) is offset by his intelligence, unswerving sense of justice and humanity to those he deems worthy. He is highly emotional and this passion drives his excellence with the single-minded determination of the obsessed. He will solve the case, he will see the evildoers brought to justice, and he will be fearless in doing so, come what may. While Monk lives in the Victorian era, his disregard for social conventions (openly suspecting the gentry instead of the servants in A Dangerous Mourning, and consistently ignoring class distinctions) imbues him with the power of a true believer and gives him access to multiple layers of society, which aids his tireless efforts.

Albicastro came from the village of Bieswangen, near Pappenheim in central Bavaria, not far from the village of Weissenburg (\\"White Castle\\", thus \\"Albicastro\\" in latin). Johann Gottfried Walther included Albicastro in his Musicalisches Lexicon (1732) under the mistaken supposition that Albicastro came from Switzerland; consequently he has often been included in lists of Swiss musicians. He might be classified as a Bavarian-born composer of Italian music that was published in both the Protestant and Catholic Low Countries. In 1686 Weissenburg arrived in Leiden, in the Netherlands, where he registered at the University of Leiden as a Musicus Academiae, but his name does not appear in the university's archives. In 1696 a collection of twelve of his trio sonatas appeared, entitled Il giardino armonico sacro-profano (\\"The sacred-profane harmonic garden\\"), Opus 3. Edited by Fran√ßois Barbry, it was published in Bruges by Fran√ßois van Heurck; no copies of the last six, or of Albicastro's opus 1 or opus 2 from Bruges seem to have survived. In Amsterdam a separate set of opus numbers were published by Estienne Roger: collections of violin sonatas (Opp. 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9), trio sonatas (Opp. 1, 4 and 8), and string concertos (Op. 7) in a Corellian idiom. During the last phases of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1713), he served as a captain of cavalry.

Acid lipase disease occurs when the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase that is needed to break down certain fats that are normally digested by the body is lacking or missing. This results in the toxic buildup of these fats in the body's cells and tissues. These fatty substances, called lipids, include waxes, oils, and cholesterol. Three rare lipid storage diseases are caused by the deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid lipase: *Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D) *Wolman disease (early onset lysosomal acid lipase deficiency) *Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD)  Epidemiology  The prevalence of Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is unknown in the general population. Wolman disease and Cholesteryl ester storage disease are both autosomal recessive diseases. Wolman disease in predominantly found in the Iranian-Jewish community and its prevalence of this disease in offspring among Iranian-Jewish couples is 1 in 4200 births. Cholesteryl ester storage disease is generally found among the German community and couples of German descent. It is estimated that 25 out of 1000000 newborns will develop the disease.  Mechanism  The lysosomal acid lipase enzyme is found within the compartments of the lysosomes with in the cell. When the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme is functioning properly, fats such as triglycerides and cholesteryl esters are broken down into their simpler lipid components through hydrolysis. After triglycerides are broken down, the fatty acids are used for energy. Cholesteryl esters are broken down into its cholesterol and fatty acid components, this delivers cholesterol to the cell. These lipids are either used by the body or sent to the liver for removal. In acid lipase disease the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme is either lacking or missing. In both CESD and Wolman's disease there is a mutation with in the LIPA gene, which maps to chromosome 10q23.2, has 10 exons and is approximately 45 kb in length, that encodes for the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme. This mutation causes a loss of function in the gene. This results in the toxic buildup of fats in the body's cells and tissues, which causes an array of symptoms.  Symptoms  In both Wolman disease and Cholesteryl ester storage disease there is a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase which causes an array of symptoms with in the body. The inability to break down fats in Wolman's disease causes symptoms of: * Abdominal distention * Adrenal calcification * Hepatic failure * Hepatomegaly * Nausea and vomiting * Steatorrhea * Anemia * Ascites * Cachexia * Jaundice * Growth delay. In Cholesteryl ester storage there are alterations in the blood lipoprotein amounts which lead to symptoms such as; hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and HDL deficiency with abnormal lipid deposition in many organs. The hallmarks of the disease in infants consist of prominent hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea and vomiting, resulting in malabsorption, growth failure and liver failure. These infants quickly develop liver fibrosis and cirrhosis due to the massive accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in the liver.  Diagnosis  Wolman Disease and Cholesteryl ester storage disease are both diagnosed by observation of previous medical history and symptoms, physical exams, laboratory tests also genetic testing. In laboratory test it is expected that the total serum concentration of cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, and triglycerides will be high and the serum concentration of high density lipoproteins are low for a positive result of acid lipase disease. The genetic tests done are: * Single-gene testing * A multigene panel * (If needed) More comprehensive genomic testing Genetic tests are performed on a sample of blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or cotton swab to collect a sample of cells from the inside surface of the cheek.  Causes and Prevention  Lysosomal acid lipase enzyme deficiency is caused by a mutation in the LIPA gene which provides instructions for the produce this enzyme. When there are malfunctions in this gene the development of Wolman disease and Cholesteryl ester storage disease take place. Prevention methods of inheriting lysosomal acid lipase deficiency would genetic counseling of the parents who are likely to be carriers of the mutated gene before having offspring.  Treatment and Prognosis  An FDA approved treatment for Wolman disease is the medication Kanuma or Sebelipase alfa. This drug works as an enzyme replacement therapy which allows the body to begin breaking down triglycerides and cholesteryl esters into their simpler lipid components once again. Some other methods of treating lysosomal acid lipase deficiency and Cholesteryl ester storage disease include; a low-fat diet, the prescription of statins and other lipid- lowering agents, stem cell transplant, and liver transplants. Lifespan for individuals with CESD is expected to be longer than individuals with Wolman disease, and available treatments may prolong life into adulthood. However, approximately 50% of individuals with CESD die in the second decade of life due to complications of liver disease or heart disease. Infants with LAL-D typically present in the first weeks of life and die within 6‚Äì12 months due to multi-organ failure.  Recent Research  There are many studies taking place to further understand how the lysosomal acid lipase disease works at a cellular and molecular level, which can be applied to the development of new treatments for these diseases. One study called \\"Role of lysosomal acid lipase in the metabolism of plasma low density lipoprotein. Observations in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with cholesteryl ester storage disease.\\" looks at the ability of human fibroblasts to hydrolyzes the cholesteryl esters of exogenous LDL and thus provides the cell with free cholesterol. Other studies look at the fact that acid lipase disease is often under diagnosed. To combat this, scientists are looking at the molecular mechanisms, differential diagnosis, and identification of the hallmarks of acid lipase disease. References *  External links  NINDS.

The NPO Saturn AL-41F is a Russian variable-bypass ratio turbofan engine, designed for supercruise flight for the MFI (Mnogofunktsionalni Frontovoy Istrebitel, \\"Multifunctional Frontline Fighter\\") program, which resulted in the Mikoyan Project 1.44. It is considered by Jane's as the Russian counterpart to the General Electric YF120 engine which lost to the more conventional fixed-bypass YF-119 in the Advanced Tactical Fighter engine program. Since the cancellation of the MFI program, the AL-41F1S and AL-41F1 designation was assigned to heavily upgraded AL-31F variants that powers the Sukhoi Su-35S and initial serial production Sukhoi Su-57 stealth aircraft. Design and development The AL-41F program, with development project designation izdeliye 20, was launched in 1982, and the first prototype engine flew in a MiG-25 Foxbat testbed. Originally developed for the Mikoyan Project 1.44, 28 engines were built, however the engine did not advance beyond prototype stage when the MiG 1.44 was cancelled. The AL-41 designation was reused for heavily upgraded variants of the Saturn AL-31, the AL-41F1 (izdeliye 117) and AL-41F1S (izdeliye 117S), used to power initial production Sukhoi Su-57 and the Sukhoi Su-35 respectively. Some of the technologies of the original AL-41F were applied in the izdeliye 117S and 117 engines. It is important to note that these engines are not considered a part of the same AL-41F line (izdeliye 20) as was planned for the Mikoyan Project 1.44 because their cores are based on that of the AL-31F, whereas the AL-41F utilizes an entirely different approach. The designation is present because the engine approaches some of the projected specifications of the AL-41F. It is also notable that the engine is capable of mounting 3D thrust vectoring nozzles for extra maneuverability.

In later years it took a pro-Beijing editorial stand. It was founded by the Wai Kee-shun family, who made their fortune in pharmaceutical industry and was the first colour-printed newspaper in Hong Kong. The newspaper was published by Tin Tin Publication Development Limited and was printed by sister company Tin Tin Colour Printing Company Limited. However, the publishing rights was owned by Tin Tin Yat Pao (International) Limited, which was majority owned by bank. The publishing rights was licensed to another company Genvon in 1984 and then Tin Tin Publication Development in 1987. In 1985, the paper's future was in doubt as the owner of the publisher, Alan Lau's business, Millie‚Äôs Handbags and Shoes, had collapsed a year earlier. The paper was kept alive by a HK$30 million bank loan, personally guaranteed by Xu Jiatun, director of the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua News Agency. In 1987, 70% stake of Tin Tin Publication Development as well as 100% share capital of Tin Tin Colour Printing was acquired by (now known as Culturecom Holdings) for HK$77 million from Ho Sai-chu couple. Jademan Holdings was also proposed to lent money to Tin Tin Publication Development, to refurbish the shareholders' loan of Ho couple to the company, as well as proposed to acquire Tin Tin Yat Pao (International) Limited from the bank and Ho couple. Ho also acquitted a defraud accusation, which the prosecutor accused Ho had defrauded Tin Tin Yat Pao (International) from 1987 to 1990. In 1990s, the controlling stake of Jademan Holdings was acquired by fellow listed company Sing Tao Holdings, making the newspaper became a sister newspaper of fellow Chinese language newspaper Sing Tao Daily, as well as English language newspaper Hong Kong Standard.

The new majority owner of Culturecom Holdings, acquired 70% stake of Tin Tin Publication Development from Culturecom Holdings in November 1999, and then also disposed the shares of Culturecom Holdings. It was reported that Tin Tin Publication Development was under a heavy net loss of HK$3 million per month. Culturecom Holdings also leased some office floor area to Tin Tin Publication Development as well as signing some service provider contract with Tin Tin Publication Development in the same month.

NO is the sole confirmed subclade of Haplogroup K2a1 (K-M2313), which is the sole subclade of Haplogroup K2a (K-M2308).G. David Poznik et al., 2016, \\"Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences\\" Nature Genetics, no. 48, pp. 593‚Äì599. NO is the dominant Y-DNA haplogroup in most parts of eastern and northern Eurasia, including East Asia, Siberia and northern Fennoscandia. Before 2016, NO was generally regarded as synonymous with K2a. Researchers such as David Poznik (Poznik et al. 2016) documented examples of previously unknown subclades of haplogroup K2, in both ancient remains and living individuals, which: (firstly) had several, varying suites of the SNPs regarded previously as uniquely defining K2a and NO, but also (secondly) lacked any of the SNPs specifically identifying haplogroups Haplogroup N (M231) and Haplogroup O (M175). This demonstrated conclusively that multiple stages of development separated K2a from NO, which therefore constituted \\"grandparent\\" and \\"grandchild\\" clades. Poznik et al. 2016 used the name \\"K2a1\\" for the Y-DNA of some of the individuals who belonged to K2a(xK2a*,NO), while also mentioning that K2a1 did not include all examples of K2a(xK2a*,NO). As of 2020, the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG) refers to NO-M214 as \\"NO1\\", and to K2a/K2a1 as \\"NO\\". There may be at least one other primary branch of NO: the ISOGG official Y-DNA haplogroup tree lists a haplogroup known as \\"NO1~\\" (CTS707/M2306) alongside NO-M214 (which ISOGG refers to as \\"NO1\\"). The tilde (~) indicates that its exact position of NO1~ in the phylogeny is unknown. It may be a primary branch or sibling of NO, it may be a primary branch or sibling of K2a1, or it may instead be a primary branch of K2a. Based on the projected origins of K2a, K2a1, and the basal haplogroups N* and O* respectively, NO* probably originated in East Asia. Distribution While there is some evidence of NO* being found in living individuals, these examples are not well-researched. Further research may instead identify them as belonging to N* (M231), N1, or the provisional subclade N2 (F3373/M2283/Page56/S323). These cases include: * 5.7% (2/35) of Bouyei males, in China or Vietnam; * a pool of four samples of Japanese males at 2.9% (6/210), particularly in Tokushima Prefecture at a rate of 5.7% (4/70),Hammer et al.

Members of Haplogroup NO* include a Telugu of Indian origin sampled in the United Kingdom and a Malay sampled in Singapore. Two sets of ancient remains previously considered as possibly belonging to NO have since been reclassified upstream to K2a. *Ust'-Ishim man dates from approximately 45,000 BP and was found in Omsk Oblast, Russia.

He was the youngest of four sons born to Joseph Henry Harper, (1750‚Äì1838), a farmer, carpenter, and storekeeper, and Elizabeth Kollyer, a Dutch burgher's daughter. With his brothers, James, John, and Joseph Wesley, he founded the Harper & Brothers publishing house. He is credited with founding Harper's Weekly (1850), Harper's Magazine (1850), and Harper's Bazaar (1867). Fletcher gave cartoonist Thomas Nast his start in Harper's Weekly, and gave Nast great editorial freedom. His newspaper Harper's Weekly rose to fame during the American Civil War because of Nast's depiction of the war. It was called by United States President Abraham Lincoln, \\"The greatest recruiter for the United States Military.\\" Harper's Weekly was also responsible for publishing the first modern image of Santa Claus (drawn by Nast). Harper died in New York City in 1877. His paper lost influence after his death when his successor George William Curtis began putting restrictions on Nast, causing him to quit in 1886.

The US Navy had a need for advanced anti-submarine ships to develop tactics for use against fast submarines such as the German Type XXI submarine, as the Soviet Union was expected to soon build submarines of similar capability, so the chief of naval operations decided to complete four of the incomplete Gearings as experiential escorts - two of which, Carpenter and , would be advanced \\"submarine killers\\", to act as substitutes for large, purpose-built anti-submarine ships such as , while two more, and , would be completed as simpler escort destroyers. Carpenter was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . Displacement was light, standard and full load. Two geared steam turbines rated at gave a speed of . As completed, Carpenters anti-submarine armament consisted of two Weapon Alpha anti-submarine rocket launchers, a trainable Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar, four torpedo tubes, and depth charges. Antiaircraft armament consisted of two twin guns, initially 50 caliber gunss and later 70 caliber Mark 26 guns. Carpenter subclass  USS Carpenter in her original configuration, 1953 The Carpenter class, or more accurately the first ship of the DDK subclass of eight modified Gearing-class destroyers served as an interim substitute to the planned specialized \\"sub-killer cruisers\\" such as , Carpenters modifications emphasized electronic equipment and anti-submarine warfare weaponry over the standard destroyer anti-aircraft and torpedo armament. Designed to counter Soviet high-speed, snorkel-equipped, diesel submarines similar to the German World War II-era Type XXIs, Carpenter was equipped with a trainable Hedgehog mortar, two Weapon Alpha antisubmarine rocket launchers, antisubmarine torpedoes, and depth charges, in addition to torpedo countermeasure equipment, towed decoys and an improved sonar system. Service history Towed to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company on 6 November 1947 for completion as a Carpenter-subclass hunter-killer antisubmarine destroyer (DDK), Carpenter was commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia, on 15 December 1949, Commander James B. Grady in command. While Carpenter fitted out at Norfolk, the ship's designation was changed to DDE (escort destroyer) on 4 March 1950. Like her three sister ships, Basilone, Epperson, and Robert A. Owens, Carpenter conducted a shakedown cruise and intensive Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, later that spring. On 26 June, the destroyer got underway for the Pacific Ocean, transited the Panama Canal on 1 July, and arrived at her new homeport, Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 13 July. Despite the outbreak of war in Korea in June 1950, the emphasis of U.S. naval construction programs gravitated towards research platforms and the development of prototype systems rather than perfecting mass-production designs. Carpenter thus became a test bed for Norfolk, herself an experimental ASW warship, and was assigned to the anti- submarine hunter-killer force out of Pearl Harbor. Carpenter began her first cruise to the Korean War zone on 4 February 1952, when she departed Pearl Harbor for duty in the Western Pacific. After arrival in Yokosuka, Japan, the destroyer conducted a hunter-killer training exercise off Okinawa before reporting to Task Force 77 (TF 77) on 3 March. Operating with the Fast Carrier Force, she spent the next month screening aircraft carriers and honing her ASW skills, missions interspersed with two trips to Wonsan harbor to pick up downed pilots for transportation back to the task force. After completing a Formosa Straits patrol in April, Carpenter joined TF 95.1, the United Nations Blockading and Escort Force operating in the Yellow Sea. While attached to a carrier group, which included British, Australian, and Canadian warships, Carpenter screened the aircraft carriers during flight operations and carried out several shore bombardment missions, including one against Ch‚Äôo Do Island. Returning to Pearl Harbor for a refit, the destroyer conducted a series of local training operations off Hawaii in July and August following the completion of those repairs and alterations. Then, in September, she departed for Eniwetok Atoll to participate in two atmospheric thermonuclear tests in Operation Ivy. During those evolutions, Carpenter conducted ASW patrols to keep Soviet submarines from observing the tests in between her duties as plane guard for the carrier , whose planes flew patrol and reconnaissance missions in the region. With both detonations complete by 16 November, Carpenter received her radiological clearance inspection and departed the next day, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 24 November.  1953‚Äì1959  Resuming local operations in Hawaii, she remained there until May 1953, when Carpenter steamed to the Far East for operations with TF 77\\\\. After rendezvous with light cruiser in early June, the destroyer proceeded to North Korea for a shore bombardment mission against gun positions in H≈≠ngnam harbor on 12 June. Although 12 rounds of 75 mm fire from shore batteries fell near Carpenter, she suffered neither hits nor casualties. Following a tender availability in Sasebo, Japan, the destroyer spent the next month screening the fast carriers. After returning to Yokosuka for a short refit on 29 July, Carpenter departed 11 August for a Formosa patrol. This evolution included screen operations with the carrier and battleship and radar tracking of numerous Chinese communist aircraft contacts. Returning to Kobe, Japan, on 6 September, the destroyer spent the next two months conducting ASW and screening operations in Korean waters. Departing Yokosuka on 30 October, Carpenter sailed to Pearl Harbor for an extensive refit. Minor repairs, tactical drills, and crew training occupied the ship until the summer of 1954, when she returned to the Western Pacific. In September, during the Quemoy and Matsu crisis between Communist China and the Nationalists on Formosa, Carpenter patrolled the Taiwan Straits for 13 tense days before the crisis passed. The destroyer remained in the region for the next three months, screening Boxer, conducting various hunter-killer ASW exercises, and patrolling the Formosa Straits. In January 1955, in line with the mutual defense treaty between Taiwan and the United States, Carpenter helped convoy Nationalist forces as they evacuated the Tachen Islands. USS Carpenter in 1957 After returning to Hawaii that spring, Carpenter resumed her regular routine of local operations and ASW exercises out of Pearl Harbor. Her fourth cruise began on 4 January 1956, when the destroyer set sail for the Western Pacific. Operating out of Yokosuka, the destroyer conducted extensive ASW training with ships of the 7th Fleet, visited ports in the Philippines and Hong Kong, and operated with units of the Royal Australian Navy. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 9 June, the destroyer underwent an extensive overhaul, followed by the now familiar pattern of local operations, crew training, and constant ASW exercises. In a change of pace the following spring, Carpenter departed Hawaii on 15 March 1957 for a series of goodwill port visits throughout the South Pacific. The destroyer stopped at American Samoa, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, and Sydney, Australia, before returning to Hawaii on 28 August. Later that fall, Carpenter underwent an overhaul and received two of the new 3-inch/70 \\"quick-firing\\" antiaircraft gun mounts for testing and evaluation. The destroyer continued this pattern of deployments for the next three years: local operations out of Pearl Harbor followed by a deployment and operations with a hunter-killer ASW group out of Japan, and then return for repairs. Her sixth Far East deployment lasted from April to September 1958, followed by training and an overhaul until March 1959. Six weeks underway training followed before another deployment in July, during which Carpenter operated in a hunter-killer ASW with the carriers and , before returning home in December.  1960‚Äì1964  In light of concerns over the threat posed by nuclear-powered Soviet submarines, Carpenter spent much of the spring of 1960 conducting ASW training and practicing aircraft carrier screening. During those evolutions, she operated with such carriers as , , and . Later in June, the warship operated in a plane guard role during Operation Cosmos ‚Äî President Dwight D. Eisenhower's trip to the Far East ‚Äî before conducting a six-week midshipman cruise ending on 26 July. Following a month-long tender availability alongside the destroyer tender , the destroyer spent much of September in dry dock for hull repairs. Departing on 17 October for her eighth Far East tour, Carpenter joined 7th Fleet's hunter-killer ASW group and conducted operations with Hornet, Hancock, and . Later that winter, as North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao troops attempted to overthrow the pro-Western Royal Laotian government, Carpenter deployed as part of the multi-carrier task force sent to the South China Sea to deter further Communist guerrilla attacks on pro-American forces in Laos. Following her return to Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1961, Carpenter entered Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 22 May for ASW modernization. Emerging from the yard in August with a new helicopter flight deck and a side-scanning AN/SQS-26 sonar to improve her submarine detection capabilities, she spent the rest of the year conducting refresher training and local operations designed to test her newly installed equipment. On 29 January 1962, Carpenter commenced exercise \\"Prairie Wolf\\" with diesel submarines and . This evolution tested the destroyer's sonar tracking abilities and ASW rocket weapons system. Other exercises over the next several months included electronic countermeasures, gunnery, sonar, and radar calibration tests, as well as practice ASW torpedo shots. The routine was broken only by occasional plane-guard operations with Hancock, an evaluation of her SQS-32 sonar capabilities against the nuclear-powered submarine , and on 20 February, service as contingency recovery ship during John Glenn's Mercury Friendship 7 orbital flight. Following a dual-ship \\"hold down\\" exercise by Carpenter and against the conventionally powered submarine on 23 May, the destroyer moved back to Pearl Harbor for three weeks of repairs alongside Bryce Canyon. She then conducted more ASW exercises, helicopter replenishment, and plane-guard training in preparation for another 7th Fleet deployment. During one ASW exercise, Carpenter forced to surface owing to battery drain. On 29 June, the destroyer's hull designation was changed to DD-825. Departing Hawaii on 2 July 1962, the destroyer arrived at Yokosuka 10 days later. After a short period alongside the destroyer tender , she began ASW exercises and screening operations for Hornet. Several barrier patrol exercises, including one with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyers and , lasted through September. Other evolutions included torpedo-firing exercises, electronic intercept tracking, and plane-guard services in the Sea of Japan. In October, Carpenter conducted a convoy-protection exercise off Okinawa, encountering several shadowing Soviet whaling ships in the process. She then visited Sasebo, Hong Kong and Subic Bay before returning to Hawaii, reaching Pearl Harbor on 17 December. Carpenter with a Soviet submarine in the Sea of Japan, 6 January 1964 Starting in January 1963, the destroyer conducted numerous training exercises off Hawaii, including submarine target services and a training mission with Canadian frigates and . In April, during a convoy exercise, the destroyer's simulated attacks \\"sank\\" and . On 11 July, Carpenter steamed south for a short training cruise to American Samoa, visiting Pago Pago, Tutuila, for three days before returning to Pearl Harbor. In August, the warship participated in fleet exercises, culminating in a convoy screen mission during which helicopters, surface ships, and Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) drones all dropped exercise torpedoes on \\"attacking\\" submarines. On 10 August Carpenter was declared \\"out of action\\" following a simulated Regulus cruise missile attack guided in by . The destroyer departed on her next Far East cruise on 12 November 1963, when she got underway in company with Hornet and . Arriving in Japan on 22 November, the warship received services from Dixie, before commencing a 7th Fleet \\"active environment\\" transit exercise with Hornet in the Sea of Japan. On 4 January 1964, the task force provoked the expected reconnaissance response from Soviet forces out of Vladivostok - numerous overflights by Tu-16 \\"Badger\\" aircraft and the appearance of a . Aside from a short excursion to investigate a surfaced Soviet , Carpenter screened Hornet until the task group steamed to Kobe on 10 January. In addition to plane-guard services and ASW training conducted that spring, the destroyer also carried out three Formosa Strait patrols. She returned to Pearl Harbor in late April to begin preparations for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization conversion.  1964‚Äì1967  USS Carpenter after her FRAM I refit, 1965 This major overhaul was intended to extend a warships' service life and improve sensor and weapon systems. Begun on 28 May, Carpenter received drone antisubmarine helicopter (DASH) support equipment, antisubmarine rocket (ASROC) weapons, and since the 3-inch/70s had proved a maintenance disaster, a dual 5-inch/38 mount forward. Communication, radar, and sonar upgrades were installed along with general equipment improvements and a helicopter refueling system. Carpenter began sea trials and equipment tests on 26 March 1965 before moving out of the shipyard on 1 July. Assigned to Destroyer Division 112 the next day, the destroyer spent the next six months carrying out refresher training and other evolutions in preparation for a Vietnam deployment. These drills included firing an exercise ASROC torpedo at the impact-rigged in August and surface ship exercises with New Zealand frigate later in the fall. Carpenter departed Hawaii on 27 December, and after a short stop to refuel at Subic Bay, joined TG 77.4 for carrier screening operations on 12 January 1966. After six weeks of plane-guard duty, Carpenter shifted to the search and rescue station in the Gulf of Tonkin in early March. On 20 March, the destroyer began a two-day surveillance mission of the Communist Chinese-held Paracel Islands before returning to Yokosuka on the 26th. Carpenter returned to the Gulf of Tonkin in mid-April for a few days of patrol and screen duties before she steamed to the gun line off the coast of Vietnam on 21 April. Over the next week, she fired a total of 318 5-inch rounds at enemy caves and bunkers in support of the United States Army amphibious landing in Operation AUSTIN II. Following visits to Subic Bay and Hong Kong, the warship returned to Hawaii, arriving there on 11 June. On 25 July, Carpenter began DASH qualification trials, and although one drone malfunctioned and crashed at sea, the DASH control team successfully dropped three exercise torpedoes during evolutions in August. This training was interrupted on 28 July when the destroyer was asked to intercept two Soviet guided missile destroyers approaching Hawaii. The crew then spent the next two days collecting electronic emission data and other useful intelligence regarding Soviet warships before returning to more mundane duties. In November, the destroyer began receiving services from in preparation for a restricted availability, which commenced 14 December, during which Carpenter received rudder repairs and new four-bladed screws. With yard work complete by 12 January 1967, the destroyer resumed a fast-paced training regimen ‚Äî including gunnery qualifications, antiaircraft drills, combat air patrol control, AN/SQS-26 sonar evaluation, and DASH operations ‚Äî in preparation for her next deployment. Departing Pearl Harbor on 6 March, Carpenter ultimately reached \\"Yankee Station\\" off Vietnam three weeks later. Familiar plane-guard duties, punctuated only by the occasional sonar, helicopter, and DASH exercise with friendly submarines filled her first two weeks on station. On 14 April, Carpenter became the surveillance operations ship for the task force, coordinating and tracking all surface and subsurface contacts for the task force on \\"Yankee Station\\". On 29 April, the destroyer stood into Subic Bay for a week of maintenance and minor repairs. After two more weeks on \\"Yankee Station\\", Carpenter proceeded north to Kaohsiung for joint sea-air training with the Taiwanese navy, arriving there on 23 May. Returning to the South China Sea on 9 June, the destroyer conducted a brief surveillance pass of the Paracels before returning to \\"Yankee Station\\" on 12 June. Following a port visit to Hong Kong in the first week of July, Carpenter continued screen operations until 22 July, when the destroyer received orders to the gun line off Vietnam. Over the next week, Carpenter carried out 14 different fire missions against targets ashore, expending 1,012 rounds of 5-inch ammunition in support of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 17th Division in the II Corps area. Sailing to Subic Bay on 1 August, the destroyer joined Sproston and sailed south for exercises with the New Zealand Navy on 4 August. Carpenter \\"crossed the line\\" on 8 August, where according to her historian, \\"the equator was not visible due to the high tide.\\" The ships reached Sydney on 15 August for a two-day port visit before proceeding on to New Zealand. Once there, the warships conducted several ASW exercises before visiting Auckland and Wellington. Departing 1 September, Carpenter steamed to Pearl Harbor via Pago Pago, reaching home on 11 September.  1967‚Äì1969  The destroyer quickly settled into the by now familiar cycle of training and upkeep. The only break came in the second week of November, when she served as an alternate recovery ship during the Apollo 4 unmanned capsule flight test. Unfortunately, the crash and loss of a DASH drone marred an otherwise uneventful mission. Misfortune dogged Carpenter when another drone crashed on 10 January 1968. Despite those mishaps, however, the ship passed all her inspections early in the year and resumed local operations in March. Departing Pearl Harbor on 29 March, the destroyer proceeded north of Midway on a secondary recovery station for another unmanned capsule flight. On 4 April, Carpenters radar tracked the Apollo 6 capsule as it passed nearly overhead on a trajectory to a safe splashdown near Bennington. In mid-April, the destroyer underwent a tender availability alongside during which the DASH system was removed. Although unmanned aerial vehicles would return to warships in the future, the DASH system's immature technology proved too unreliable for continued operation. Carpenter spent the next few months conducting refresher training in preparation for a major fleet exercise that summer. Underway for San Diego, California, and STRIKEX 1-68 on 14 June, Carpenter carried out shore bombardment, anti-surface and anti-cruise missile operations in the waters off Southern California until 2 July. She then steamed to Santa Monica, California, for a port visit before returning to Pearl Harbor. Following a series of pre-deployment tests and inspections, and a tender availability alongside Bryce Canyon, Carpenter received upgrades to her radar fire-control systems in preparation for her next Vietnam tour. After testing the new equipment in early September, Carpenter got underway for another Far East deployment on 17 September. Arriving on \\"Yankee Station\\" on 7 October, she conducted plane-guard and screen operations for assigned carriers. Aside from a short port visit to Hong Kong in late October, she remained there for the next two months, and was present when air strikes against North Vietnam were terminated on 1 November. Detached for two weeks on 13 December, Carpenter patrolled the waters south of Da Nang in support of coastal interdiction efforts as part of Operation Market Time. The warship also provided gunfire support for friendly riverine forces south of Chu Lai. Other than a period of Soviet trawler surveillance between 30 January and 2 February 1969, Carpenter remained on \\"Yankee Station\\" until 11 February, when she steamed to Subic Bay for refueling and upkeep. Departing that same day, the warship sailed for home and moored at Pearl Harbor on 1 March.  1969‚Äì1972  The destroyer's usual post-deployment routine of inspections, maintenance, and training lasted through the summer, ending with Carpenter entering Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul on 13 October. With that yard work complete on 13 February 1970, the destroyer spent the next three months conducting equipment tests, readiness evaluations, and crew training. After a final series of inspections, she got underway for the South China Sea on 3 June. Arriving on the still-busy \\"Yankee Station\\" on 1 July, Carpenter provided plane-guard services to a variety of carriers, including , , and . In mid-August, she proceeded north to Yokosuka for ten days of upkeep alongside the repair ship . She then commenced three weeks of Taiwan Straits picket duties. Relieved on 22 September, Carpenter returned to \\"Yankee Station\\" to provide screen and plane- guard services. In preparation for a port visit to Sydney, the warship sailed to Subic Bay for upkeep on 5 November. While there, workmen discovered cracks in the destroyer's fuel tanks and the ship was diverted to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Arriving on 25 November, the ship moored alongside Bryce Canyon and the offending compartments were repaired by 15 January 1971. Carpenter conducted several major training exercises that spring, including ASW exercises with guided missile destroyer and submarines and in January, Apollo recovery ship training in February, and exercise torpedo firings at on 31 March and on 30 April. This training regimen ended on 4 June, when the destroyer sailed to Oregon for the Portland Rose Festival. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 20 June, Carpenter resumed underway training in preparation for her next deployment. That commenced on 9 September, when the destroyer got underway for the Far East. After an ASW exercise with south of Manila Bay, Carpenter arrived at Subic Bay on 24 September to have her ECM antenna repaired. Departing four days later, she took up a screen position on \\"Yankee Station\\" and provided plane-guard services for until 11 October. While steaming towards Subic Bay that day, the crew discovered several leaks in the ship's hull. Moving immediately into dry dock AFDM-6 at Subic Bay, the rusted plating was repaired by work crews and Carpenter returned to \\"Yankee Station\\" on 5 November. She then provided plane-guard services to , , and through January 1972. Departing the area on 15 February, the destroyer arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 March.  1972‚Äì1975  After a period of leave and upkeep, the destroyer moved into Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 5 April for minor hull repairs. The deterioration proved too severe to fully repair in Hawaii, however, and the warship proceeded to Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard at San Francisco, on 22 September for major repairs and an overhaul. With repairs complete on 31 January 1973, the warship moved out of dry dock and officially shifted her homeport to San Francisco. Carpenter was also assigned to the Naval Reserve training force, vice the active fleet. After settling into her new assignment, the destroyer began training evolutions in preparation for a reserve-training cruise to the Western Pacific. Departing 12 June, the destroyer joined , , and at Seattle, Washington, and sailed north to Alaska. Following a brief stop to refuel at Adak, the squadron reached Yokosuka on 28 June. There, the destroyers participated in ASWEX 7-73 in July, a joint exercise with four Japanese destroyers and the submarine . After a port visit to Sasebo, the warships moved on to Formosa and participated in exercise \\"Shark Hunt III\\" with Taiwanese Navy destroyers. After liberty and upkeep, the destroyer group departed Taiwan on 8 August, and following fuels stops at Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, arrived at San Francisco on 30 August. Owing to major budget shortfalls in the Department of the Navy, Carpenters reduced crew conducted only local operations through 1974 and into 1975. Her training that year focused on exercises designed to increase the readiness of nucleus and reserve crews. These were mainly short underway assignments, such as plane-guard assignments, replenishment training, and test dive-escort services for nuclear submarines and . The warship also carried out a vigorous public- affairs program during port visits up and down the West Coast.  1976‚Äì1980  This pattern of operations continued until 27 September 1976, when the destroyer began an overhaul at Bethlehem Steel shipyard in San Francisco. Completed on 26 August 1977, the aging destroyer had received major repairs to her main propulsion plant and combat-system upgrades. Returning to reserve operations, Carpenter spent the next three years conducting local operations interspersed with longer training cruises. The latter included trips to Ensenada, Mexico, and Anchorage, Alaska. Carpenters last underway period took place in May and June 1980, during which she provided plane-guard services for Ranger and conducted an ASW exercise with McKean and Bonefish. Upon her return, the crew began preparations to turn over the ship to the Republic of Turkey as part of the Security Assistance Program. Anƒ±ttepe underway in the Mediterranean Sea, 1988  TCG Anittepe (D-347)  Decommissioned on 20 February 1981, Carpenter was leased to the Republic of Turkey that same day. Renamed TCG Anittepe (D-347), the destroyer was purchased outright on 8 June 1987 and served in the Turkish Navy through the 1990s. After her second career, she was retired in November 1997, completing over 52 years of service. She was broken up for scrap in 1999.

At various formal balls the first dance was led by the guest of honor, which was usually the person of the highest social position in a given context, such as a member of the royal family, if any were present. Their dance was the opening of the ball. As these were generally long country dances, the guests of honor would be the first people to go down the set, not the only two people dancing for the entirety of the first piece of music. In 17th-century France, the minuet, also called \\"the Queen of Dances\\", was the first dance. In the Victorian era of Great Britain the first dance was a quadrille.Thomas E. Hill, \\"Essential Handbook of Victorian Etiquette\\" (1994) (paperback) In 19th century Russian Empire balls were opened with Polonaise. Another meaning is the first occurrence of a young lady in a social gathering. It could have happened either during a usual ball or during a specially arranged debutante ball or cotillion. Weddings A bride and groom enjoying their first dance at their wedding The \\"first dance\\" of a married couple is a popular element at modern European and American wedding receptions or post- wedding celebrations. The newly married couple, as the guests of honor at a dance, open the dancing. Originally printed in The style of dance is a personal choice. Some couples opt for a rehearsed, choreographed dance, whereas sources like etiquette columnist Judith Martin feel that performing a choreographed duet for spectators is inappropriate. In the past, the couple did not dance the first dance alone. In her 1922 guide, Etiquette, Emily Post recommended that newlyweds not join the dancing until after their guests had begun, and simply dance with one another first before moving on to other partners. This occurred while other guests continued dancing, and was not given particular attention or treated as a performance. In the current times, ballroom dance is not a skill that is common within society. Therefore, some modern couples either slow dance or learn a dance, whether it be a ballroom dance style or a choreographed dance routine. The music to which they dance is also highly varied, with modern chart hits often being selected. Teaching and rehearsing the \\"first dance\\" is now a service offered by dance studios, independent dance instructors and specialist wedding dance tuition companies. Other * At \\"Studni√≥wka\\", a kind of prom in Poland, the first dance is usually a polonaise, which students usually have to practice before the ball. Metaphorical use Today, in modern day, the phrase \\"to open the ball\\" has become a figure of speech for initiating an activity which will be subsequently continued by others. The term has been used in descriptions of battle scenes.From Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Drums Of The Fore And Aft\\": Over that pock-marked ground the Regiment had to pass, and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the piping pickets; ducking in perfect time, as though it had been brazed on a rod.

Early life Newman Taylor Baker's paternal grandfather, Thomas Nelson Baker Sr., was the only former slave to receive a PhD from Yale University (1906). His father (chemistry) and siblings graduated from Oberlin College and Conservatory. Edith Baker (voice and piano), Ruth B. Baker (voice and piano), and Harry B. Baker (piano and organ), his aunts and uncle, were graduates of Oberlin Conservatory of Music. His maternal grandfather, Reverend Newman D. Taylor, known as the \\"Roland Hayes\\" of Mississippi, gave vocal recitals throughout the state and his uncle, Newman C. Taylor, accompanied him on piano. His aunt, India Taylor Johnson (a classmate of Dr. Billy Taylor at Virginia State University), was a vocal music and piano teacher in the Norfolk, VA public school system. His parents were Ruth Taylor Baker, born Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Dr. T. Nelson Baker, Jr, born Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Newman's mother was an Associate Professor of English, and his father was Head of the Chemistry Department. He sang bass in the A Cappella Choir and played oboe in the Concert Band and the Symphony Orchestra. His parents played four-hand transcriptions of Brahms and Beethoven symphonies at home. They lived on the campus in faculty housing. Newman's brother, Dr. T. Nelson Baker, III, was Newman's source for recordings of Max Roach and Clifford Brown, Horace Silver, Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderley, Ella Fitzgerald, Art Blakey, and many others. Newman Taylor Baker received his first drum the Christmas before he turned three; soon he was playing at home with jazz and classical recordings. Growing up on the campus of Virginia State University, he attended performances of leading international artists and orchestras, and was mentored by members of the music faculty: He began formal study of drums at five years as a member of the children's band for the campus elementary school and played in the university concert band from fourth- seventh grade. He was the youngest member of both bands. As a child, and later as a college student, he studied with Virginia State University music faculty including Dr. F. Nathaniel Gatlin, Dr. Undine S. Moore, and Dr. Thomas C. Bridge. Baker is a graduate of Kent School in 1961 and earned a Bachelor of Science with a major in education from Virginia State University. He went on to study with Fred Begun, solo timpanist National Symphony Orchestra Washington, DC, and Harold Jones, School of Music East Carolina University at Greenville, North Carolina, where he completed a Master of Music in Education. Settling in New York City, he studied with Saul Goodman, solo timpanist New York Philharmonic Repertoire Institute, and Billy Hart. Career WashboardXT In 2010, Newman met the washboard working with the Ebony Hillbillies and it changed his life, resulting in Washboard XT and his current pursuit of washboard music for the 21st century. He defines Washboard XT as the combination of the musical and artistic knowledge, skills and creativity accumulated over his 50-year career and the washboard, an instrument embedded with the 19th-century history and culture of his U.S. African heritage. Personally significant for him because his paternal grandfather, Rev. Dr. T. Nelson Baker (1860-1941), the first U.S. African to receive a Ph.D. in Philosophy (Yale University, 1903), lived during the heyday of the washboard, a 19th-century tool of drudgery turned into a musical instrument of pleasure and relief. Newman extends the washboard language by using expended shotgun shells (a tradition of Southeastern U.S.) on four fingers of each hand, customizing the physical instrument and adding microphones, effects pedals, and amplifiers. This produces a unique sound with more presence, variety, and responsiveness than the traditional thimbles, spoons, or knife handles. Approaching the washboard as a hand drum, touch is central to Newman's performance. He creates a great variety in texture, color, and articulation through the angle of the shells where they make contact, the weight of the arm when contact is made and the number of fingers is used. He found that his sound on the washboard blends with numerous combinations of instruments, and is applicable to a variety of musical genres and styles including but not limited to Jazz (swing, bebop, post-bop, hard bop, avant-garde, free jazz, fusion), Blues (acoustic and electric), World (Brazilian, Colombian, Cuban, Jamaican), Roots, Classical (string orchestra, brass ensembles, woodwind ensembles), Electronic, New Music and Modern Dance.

(NENACO) was one of the oldest domestic shipping companies in the Philippines. It was also one of the largest companies in the passenger transport business in the Philippines. Its main hub was the renowned Pier 2 in Manila North Harbor. NENACO later merged with SuperCat, SuperFerry and Cebu Ferries to form 2GO Travel, the second largest Philippine shipping merger next to the William Lines-Gothong Lines-Aboitiz Shipping merger (WG&A;) in 1996. At the same time, the China-Asean Investment Cooperation Fund, a private equity fund wholly owned the government of the People's Republic of China through an equity infusion gained a controlling interest in Negros Navigation and subsequently changed the company into the 2GO Group with 2GO Travel its shipping-company subsidiary. The 'NENACO' brand was retired in mid-2012. History It was organized and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 26, 1932 for the purpose of transporting passengers and cargo at ports of call in the Philippines. In the 1960s Nenaco was the first among the domestic shipping companies to operate brand new, fast and luxurious air conditioned passenger ships. In the 70s, it was first to construct and operate a modern passenger terminal in Manila‚Äôs North Harbor and likewise pioneered in offering special cruises to the Philippine tourist spots using its coastwise vessels. In the 1980s Nenaco launched its containerization program and ushered a new industry trend on the use of roll-on roll-off (‚ÄúRORO‚Äù) vessels. It also deploys shuttle buses in Baclaran, Cubao and Alabang which takes passengers to the pier terminal. In the 1990s, Nenaco became the first Philippine shipping company to be listed in the stock exchange. Proceeds amounting to P916.86 million from the initial public offering (IPO) were used to support the ‚ÄúGlobalization Program‚Äù of the company that involved fleet expansion and service modernization.

As the craft increases its speed the hydrofoils lift the hull up and out of the water, greatly reducing wetted area, resulting in decreased drag and increased speed. A sailing hydrofoil can achieve speeds exceeding twice the wind speed. Both monohull and multihull sailboats can be retrofitted with hydrofoils, although greater stability can be achieved by using the wider planform of a catamaran or trimaran. Typical configurations Some multihulls use three foils; two main forward foils provide lift so that the boat \\"flies\\" while a horizontal foil on the rudder is trimmed to drive and control altitude. On catamarans, a single main foil can be attached between the hulls just in front of the center of gravity and at 2 degrees of incidence, spanning the tunnel with supporting struts. Hydrofoil catamarans are also called foilcats. Multihull sailboats can also employ hydrofoils only to assist performance. Just as daggerboards and rudders are foils that enhance the control of a boat, assisting hydrofoils provide lift to the hull to reduce the wetted area without actually lifting the boat completely out of the water. Monohull boats typically employ a \\"ladder\\" arrangement of hydrofoils splayed out with a dihedral angle of 50 degrees, with a stabilizing rudder foil. One of the earliest examples is the Monitor boat from 1957. This design offers the advantages of maximum lifting foil area at slow speeds and less at higher speeds, with rolling resistance arising from the dihedral support of the outboard ladder foils. Foiling Classes Monohulls International Moth Rohan Veal sailing a Bladerider The most widespread use of hydrofoils in sailboats to date has been in the International Moth class. Andy Paterson of Bloodaxe boats on the Isle of Wight is widely considered to have developed the first functional foiling Moth, though his boat had three foils in a tripod arrangement. Brett Burvill sailed a narrow skiff Moth with inclined surface- piercing hydrofoils to a race win at the Moth World Championships in 2001 in Australia, which was the first time a hydrofoil Moth had won a race at a World Championship. This hydrofoil configuration was later declared illegal by the class, as it was felt to constitute a multihull, which is prohibited by class rules. Initially Ian Ward in Sydney, Australia developed the first centerline foiling Moth which demonstrated that sailing on centerboard and rudder foils alone was feasible. Subsequently, Garth and John Ilett in Perth, Australia developed a two-hydrofoil system for the Moth with active flap control for the main foil via a surface sensor. John's company Fastacraft was the first to produce a commercially available hydrofoil International Moth. Fasta Craft's Prowler design, superseded in 2008 by the F-Zero, features a carbon-fiber hull, inverted \\"T\\" foils on the centerboard and rudder, and can reach speeds of over 27 knots. Fasta Craft has since been joined in producing hydrofoil Moths by several other companies, including Bladerider, Assassin, Exocet, and Aardvark Technologies. Although initially debated fiercely within the class, the adoption of hydrofoils has proven a success for the International Moth class, with rapid fleet growth in the years since 2001. All World Championships since 2004 have been won by hydrofoil-equipped Moths, which can become foilborne in as little as six knots of breeze when steered by an experienced sailor of lighter weight. The class rule remains open to development of all boat components including hydrofoil systems, and development within the class continues to be spurred by both commercial and individual/amateur efforts. Laser dinghy Glide Free Foils on a Laser sailing dinghy The first time a Laser foiled was in December 2009 by Ian Ward in Sydney, Australia. Top speeds of around 23-25kts are possible with this kit. The foils can be removed and the boat remains class legal. This foiling system is unique in that it is retractable, has flapless foils and the height sensing 'wand' is integrated within the daggerboard. Optimist The \\"world's least advanced sailboat\\" was converted to hydrofoiling by the Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden, in 2017. The Optimist, only 2.3 metres in length and with a sail area of 3.3 square metres, is normally limited to speeds below 4 knots. The hydrofoils allows the optimist dinghy to achieve 12 knots in only 12 knots of wind. AC75 The AC75 (America's Cup 75 class) is a 75ft sailboat class, governing the construction and operation of the yachts to be used in the 2021 America's Cup. The boat type is a foiling monohull with canting ballasted T-wing hydrofoils mounted on port and starboard topside longitudinal drums, a centerline T-wing rudder, and no keel.  Catamarans America's Cup catamarans Foils have been used in the America's Cup since 2013. =GC32= The GC32 is carbon fibre production hydrofoil catamaran 32 feet in length (9.75 meters). It has a top speed of about . They are sailed in the GC32 Racing Tour, and have replaced the Extreme 40's in the Extreme Sailing Series. =AC72= The 2013 America's Cup featured daggerboard catamarans. Under the terms of the protocol, these daggerboards could not feature trim tabs, could not exceed the beam of the boat when raised and could not be adjusted when lowered, but a loophole exploited by three teams was to create T-shaped rudders and L-shaped daggerboards of which the leeward appendage serves as a hydrofoil on all points of sailing conditions in winds over 10 knots. On September 6, 2012 in Auckland, during Team New Zealand's fifth day of trials, their boat achieved with a level trim and no heeling in 17 knots of breeze. =AC45f/AC50= AC45f sailing on hydrofoils with one daggerboard raised above the water. The 2015‚Äì16 America's Cup World Series was raced with hydrofoiling AC45f catamarans, which are smaller versions of the AC72. The 2017 America's Cup was raced in the fully foiling AC50 class. C-Class catamarans Recent International C-class catamaran have been foiling, and further development is expected. A-Class catamarans International A-class catamaran rules initially allowed hydrofoils but were changed to specifically limit the foil span in 2000 after the measurer and president were approached by Jeremy Banks, an Australian sailor, with a hydrofoiling design. Over time sailors still found a way to foil. The 2014 A-Class Catamaran World Titles in Takapuna New Zealand demonstrated early foiling capabilities to the class. Now the A-Class can foil stably downwind in 6 knots and upwind in 12 knots or more. Peak speeds are reported to be about 30 knots and 2.5X wind speed. The A-Class has set the standard for 4-point foiling that many classes are now adopting. Nacra 17 catamaran The Nacra 17 as raced at the 2016 Olympics was capable of elevated foiling under some conditions. For the 2017 World Championships, the Nacra was upgraded to a fully foiling yacht, to be raced at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Nacra F20 catamaran The Nacra F20 is a catamaran similar in design to Nacra Sailing's former 20 foot catamaran, however it is made out of carbon fiber and uses curved daggerboards as hydrofoils.  Flying Phantom  The Flying Phantom is a catamaran that uses curved daggerboards as hydrofoils. iFLY15 The iFlY15 sailing on its stabilized four daggerboard hydrofoils. iFLY15 is a 15-foot hydrofoil catamaran equipped with automatic foils, built by CEC Catamarans GmbH. It uses a mechanical automatic system to stabilize the horizontal trim in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Jibes are facilitated by the four T-shaped foils which are always in the water and stabilize the boat.  Trimarans  TriFoiler In the 1990s the Hobie Cat company manufactured the TriFoiler (no longer in production), a twin-sail trimaran with a mainsail on each outrigger capable of 35+ knot speeds in typical sailing conditions, making the TriFoiler the fastest production sailboat in the world. The prototype of the Hobie TriFoiler, called Longshot, was developed by brothers Dan and Greg Ketterman in conjunction with Russell Long. Though more streamlined than the Trifoiler and having smaller hydrofoils, Longshot still holds the Class A speedsailing record of 43.55 knots on a 500-meter course, set in Tarifa Spain in 1993. Until recently, it was the only existing speedsailing record held by a hydrofoil, but the recent records of Hydropt√®re have added to the list with record breaking runs across the English Channel. WindRider Rave In 1998, WindRider LLC introduced the WindRider Rave, a popular two-person trimaran hydrofoil capable of lifting off in as little as 12-13 knots of wind. The Rave is capable of sailing between 1.5 and 2 times wind speed. The boat's mainsail has no boom. The Rave broke new ground in the development of flapped foils and control systems. Experimental designs L'hydropt√®re experimental hydrofoil. Non-production experimental designs have been built: *The French experimental Hydropt√®re set numerous speed records. The boat attained a record speed of 47.6 knots with a goal of breaking the \\"50 knot barrier\\" in 2008. On 4 September 2009, l‚ÄôHydropt√®re broke the world speed sailing record, sustaining a speed of 51.36 knots for 500m. * The Vestas Sailrocket 2, a boat specifically built for breaking the world speed sailing record, accomplished this on 18 November 2012, and then broke its own record on 24 November 2012 by sailing 65.45 knots. * A Hobie 18 foilcat prototype called Kangalope with foil kits attached. * Mirabaud LX is a Swiss 1.2 meter hydrofoil boat with traditional hull replaced with centerfloat, supporting spar for foil, sail and crew perch similar to moth sailing boat. * Rich Miller's hydrofoil sailboard.

He is widely regarded as the best representative of 20th century Mexican religious music, in addition to his important contributions to the Mexican nationalist music movement. He is considered by some to be the mainstay of the nacionalismo sacro (sacred nationalism) movement. Biography He was born in the city of Morelia in the Mexican state of Michoac√°n. He began his musical career at the age of seven as choir-boy in the Orfe√≥n P√≠o X, studying in the Colegio de Infantes de la Catedral. His talent was discovered by his teachers Felipe Aguilera Ruiz and Ignacio Mier y Arriaga, who succeeded in getting him recommended and admitted in 1928 to the Instituto Pontificio de M√∫sica Sagrada (Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music) of Rome by the Can√≥nigo Jos√© Mar√≠a Villase√±or. In this institution he was instructed in organ, counterpoint, fugue, paleographic musicology, composition, instrumentation, harmony and Gregorian chant, by his teachers Cesare Dobici, Raffaele Manari, Raffaele Casimiri, Paolo M. Ferretti, and Licinio Refice. He graduated two years later with the titles of Doctor in Gregorian chant, Master in composition, and organ concert performer. In 1933, he returned to Mexico to be director of the Escuela Superior de M√∫sica Sagrada (Sacred Music High School) of Morelia, a position he held for twenty years. In Morelia he fought relentlessly to create schools, give concerts, courses and congresses. He published many books, sheet music, and specialized magazines, giving foremost importance to sacred music. In 1939, he founded the Schola Cantorum magazine, the first periodical to publish musicological, musical, and pedagogic material. It was one of the most important means of musical diffusion in his time. In his time, Miguel Bernal made himself an important spot in multiple social circles in Mexico, and made friends with other great musicians of his time, including Manuel M. Ponce and Silvestre Revueltas. He was recognized internationally and many of his works were premiered in Spain. He created the Amigos de la M√∫sica (Music Friends) society in 1938. In 1944 he organized and directed the Coro de los Ni√±os Cantores de Morelia (Morelia Singing Boys Choir). In 1945 he became director of the Conservatorio de las Rosas, where he worked to bring the institution up to date and gave its current image. Between 1945 and 1946 he toured the United States and Canada giving organ concerts. He was dean of the College of Music of the Loyola University New Orleans until his death in 1956 due to a heart attack. Miguel Bernal also regularly published in his periodical publication Schola Cantorum. Works His most important works include: *Ave Gratia Plena (1924) *Cuarteto Virreinal (1937) *Suite Sinf√≥nica Michoac√°n (1940) *Por el Valle de las Rosas (1941) *Opera: Tata Vasco (1941) *Noche en Morelia (1941) *Misa Aeternae Trinitatis (1941) *La Virgen que Forj√≥ una Patria (1942) *Tingambato (1943) *Angelus (1943) *Misa Guadalupana Juandieguito (1945) *Sinfon√≠a-Poema: M√©xico (1946) *Retablo Medieval: Concertino para √ìrgano y Orquesta (1949) *Tres Cartas de M√©xico (1949) *El Chueco (1951) *Carteles (1952) *Los Tres Galanes de Juana (1952) *Sinfon√≠a Hidalgo (1953) *Ant√≠fonas para M√©xico (1954) *El Himno de los Bosques (1956) His large musical repertoire includes diverse works. One of the most noteworthy is Tata Vasco (1941), symphonic drama which speaks of Vasco de Quiroga, called Tata Vasco by the native Pur√©pecha people.Margarita Murillo Guerrero, Una nueva partitura, Ediciones Rialp (2001), Pag. 23, It premiered in P√°tzcuaro, Mexico in 1941 and was later performed in Madrid in 1948Stevenson, Robert, Music in Mexico: A historical survey, Crowell, 1952, p. 264 with costumes and scenery by Alejandro Rangel Hidalgo. This work combines indigenous peoples‚Äô chants, gregorian chants and romantic melodies to represent each part of the story. Bernal composed many of his works at the request of other parties. ‚ÄúNoche de Morelia‚Äù (1941) was made by request of the local Red Cross, and premiered by the Matinal Symphony Orchestra under the direction of its header and founder Carlos Ch√°vez. This work is representative of many of the customs of the people of Morelia at the time. His Symphony-Poem \\"Mexico\\" (1946), one of his most representative nationalist works, gave him the acknowledgment of the Spanish composer Joaquin Turina. In his \\"Concertino para √ìrgano y Orquesta\\" (1949) he manifests his own admiration for great composers of the European Baroque and Classical periods, the influence of which is not as noticeable in his other, earlier works. Bernal Jim√©nez demonstrates his harmonious dexterity by arranging the identity of the organ as a solo instrument and accompanies it grandiloquently with an orchestra. The medieval altarpiece that designs this work is characterized in its two first parts; \\"Mester de Juglares\\" and \\"Mester de Clerecia\\". \\"El Chueco\\" (1951) is considered as one of the most representative works of Mexican ballet of the 20th century. The work shows a nationalist sonority characterized by popular themes, in a background that seems inherently religious. The work was released in 1951 by the National Symphony Orchestra in the Palacio de Bellas Artes and was directed by Bernal Jim√©nez himself. His \\"Sinfonia Hidalgo\\" (1953) was requested by the \\"Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo\\" and was released by the National Symphony Orchestra by its author in the \\"Teatro Ocampo\\" of Morelia. Style and influences Because of his birth at the start of the Mexican Revolution, the works of Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez are found to be defined by a marked nationalism. His religious education and devotion to Catholicism, combined with his nationalism, made him become the head of the movement known as \\"Nacionalismo sacro\\", the product of the \\"motu proprio\\", published by the Pope Pius X in 1903. This document promoted the reintroduction of sacred music by medium of blending it with regional elements. This, along with the religious tolerance which was the product of the arrangements between the church and the Mexican state after the \\"Guerra Cristera\\", defined the style of one of the musicians with most influence in contemporary Mexican music. Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez defended the application of innovative tendencies in religious music to vindicate its supremacy as a holy art over the profane. His style of music is eclectic, music that intends to encompass all the elements of Mexico and to expose all the elements of its reality. Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez also shows common elements of Manuel M. Ponce and other nationalist composers of this era. He also seems to mix his music with themes obtained from popular traditions, like work chants, religious mottoes and melodies of political context. Harmonically, however, his music is of a markedly conservative strain. It bears the influences of the pan-modal style offered up by the Catholic Church style of the twentieth century Schola Cantorum, along with elements of Debussy and other composers thrown in to good effect. \\"Tres Cartas de Mexico\\", for example, practically quotes Debussy's Nocturnes for orchestra. Musicological work As a musicologist, he investigated the history of colonial music. After arduous and tedious searches, he discovered the first archive of Mexican colonial music, which dates from the 18th century, and comes from the \\"School of Santa Rosa de Virreinato\\". Pedagogical work Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez also worked as a great pedagogist. His methods and publications were tested with success in the \\"Conservatorio de las Rosas\\" and the \\"Escuela Popular de Bellas Artes\\". In 1939 he founded the magazine \\"Schola Cantorum\\" which was, for a long time, one of the most important media of musical diffusion of the country. The magazine kept being published periodically until the year 1974, and until that year, it conserved the original format proposed by its creator. In this magazine, Bernal Jim√©nez constantly published musical, musicological and pedagogical material under pseudonyms such as \\"M.Mouse\\", \\"Q.U.D\\", \\"Primicerius\\", \\"Jaime Le Brungel\\" and \\"Fray Florindo\\". Miguel Bernal was a prolific academic and his bibliographic archive consists of 11 books and 173 articles, many of which were used in the teachings of sacred music in varied locations throughout the country, and in seminaries in Mexico and abroad. In what are commonly regarded as his most important works, he elaborated on methods of music theory in Gregorian Chant. Included in this category are \\"La Disciplina Coral\\", \\"Las tres etapas de la ejecucion gregoriana\\", \\"teoria del canto gregoriano\\", ‚ÄúEl acompa√±amiento gregoriano‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa direcci√≥n gregoriana‚Äù. Achievements During his life he received the \\"Premio Pontificio\\" in three occasions (1930, 1931 y 1932), the \\"Diploma de Honor de la Federaci√≥n Teatral Mexicana\\" (1941), the \\"Medalla al M√©rito Civil\\", given by the newspaper \\"El Universal\\" (1941), the \\"Premio Nacional\\" (1943) for the music used in the movie \\"La Virgen que forj√≥ una Patria\\", The \\"Condecoracion Generalisimo Morelos\\" (1945) and the \\"Primer Premio del Concurso Chopin\\" (1949). In 1956, he was declared \\"favorite child\\" of the state of Michoac√°n.

Biography The son of Henry Hogan and Semantha Barnes, Cassius McDonald Barnes was born in Livingston County in western New York. When he was a young boy the family moved to Michigan. He attended both public schools and the Wesleyan Church Seminary in Albion, Michigan. In 1861, at the age of sixteen, Barnes joined the Union army as a volunteer soldier. His experience in telegraphy earned him a position in the Military Telegraph and Engineering Corps of the Union army. He served for the duration of the war and spent a portion of his enlistment as the secretary to Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. Barnes left the army at the age of twenty and moved to the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas, where on June 6, 1868, he wed the former Elizabeth Mary Bartlett of North Adams, Massachusetts. His second marriage was to a divorcee, Rebecca Cagle Forney, in Chicago in 1910. Career In 1876, Barnes, a Republican, moved to Fort Smtih, Arkansas, to accept the position as Chief Deputy United States Marshal over the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas under Judge Isaac Parker. who was appointed the previous year by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant as the federal judge. Barnes gained a friendship with the powerful Clayton family, most notably former Governor of Arkansas and (then) U. S. Senator Powell Clayton. Through his friendship with Clayton, Barnes was appointed, by President Benjamin Harrison as the Receiver of the United States Land Office at Guthrie, Oklahoma, in 1890 with the opening of Oklahoma Territory. He held that position for four years until the return of President Grover Cleveland. During his tenure as receiver, Barnes studied law and passed the bar exam in 1893. He served as a member of the 3rd and 4th sessions of the Oklahoma Territorial Legislature from 1895 to 1897. During the 3rd session, he was Speaker of the body. When President William McKinley, a Republican, took office in 1897, he appointed Barnes to replace the outgoing Democrat William Cary Renfrow as governor of Oklahoma Territory. Barnes formally took the oath of office on May 24, 1897. During his four-year term, Barnes defeated the attempts of the 6th Legislature to create numerous additional territorial institutions justified by the growing idea for the formation of the State of Oklahoma. Barnes promptly vetoed this legislation. His term in office ended on April 15, 1901, when William Miller Jenkins took the oath of office as his successor. Governor Barnes continued to live in Guthrie, at which he served as the president of the Logan County Bank. He was elected to and served as mayor of Guthrie in from 1903 to 1905 and again in from 1907 to 1909. During his second term as mayor of Guthrie his wife, Elizabeth, died on May 27, 1908. He and second wife, Rebecca, relocated to Leavenworth, Kansas, where she served as an instructor in a girl's seminary and became a postal telegraph operator there. Death and legacy In his later years as his health began to fail, he relocated again, this time to New Mexico. He died at Albuquerque. His body was returned to Guthrie and interred at the Summit View Cemetery. Barnes was a member of the Episcopal Church, serving as a senior warden of the Guthrie church for many years. He was an active affiliate of both the Scottish and York rites of the Masonic fraternity.

Early life Born in 1912 in the village of Sheikhpur, Ballia District, United Province (renamed as Uttar Pradesh after the Indian independence) Nushoor had 7 siblings. He received his early education at home. Nushoor had begun to compose poems from an early age and by the age of 13 had become famous in his locality as a poet. Career Nushoor's major breakthrough came in a poetry session featuring the famous poet Jigar Moradabadi. Jigar Moradabadi had been reciting poems for some time and desired to take a break. Nushoor offered to come on stage and recite a few of his own poems while Jigar Moradabadi did so. It was in this forum that Nushoor was first recognized by the literary circles as a talented poet. Even Jigar Moradabadi acknowledged the young man's skill. He is known as one of Urdu's last romantic poets, Nushoor published several compilations of Urdu poetry and a volume on philosophy, named the Sabah-e- hind. Despite being very popular in literary circles, Nushoor refused to lend his poetry to the then emerging Indian movie industry. It is perhaps for this reason that Nushoor could not gain the massive fame that his contemporaries had. Personal life Nushoor and his wife have two sons and two daughters. Nushoor died in 1983.

It was discovered in 2003, with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Keck Telescope, both on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and announced by researchers at the University of Toronto. The supernova occurred in a galaxy some 4 billion light-years from Earth. It was nicknamed after the 1996 song \\"Champagne Supernova\\" by English rock band Oasis. It was unusual because of the mass of its progenitor. According to the current understanding, white dwarf stars explode as Type Ia supernovas when their mass approaches 1.4 solar masses, termed the Chandrasekhar limit. The mass added to the star is believed to be donated by a companion star, either from the companion's stellar wind or the overflow of its Roche lobe as it evolves. However, the progenitor of SN 2003fg reached two solar masses before exploding. The primary mechanism invoked to explain how a white dwarf can exceed the Chandrasekhar mass is unusually rapid rotation; the added support effectively increases the critical mass. An alternative explanation is that the explosion resulted from the merger of two white dwarfs. The evidence indicating a higher than normal mass comes from the light curve and spectra of the supernova‚Äîwhile it was particularly overluminous, the kinetic energies measured from the spectra appeared smaller than usual. One proposed explanation is that more of the total kinetic energy budget was expended climbing out of the deeper than usual potential well. This is important because the brightness of type Ia supernovae was thought to be essentially uniform, making them useful \\"standard candles\\" in measuring distances in the universe. Such an aberrant type Ia supernova could throw distances and other scientific work into doubt; however, the light curve characteristics of SN 2003fg were such that it would never have been mistaken for an ordinary high-redshift Type Ia supernova.

Duprat was one the main architects in the introduction of Holocaust denial in France. Life and career Fran√ßois Duprat was born on 26 October 1940, in Ajaccio, Corsica, and was educated in Bayonne, Toulouse, at the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. He graduated in History at the Sorbonne, earning a diploma of higher studies in history in 1963.Francis Bergeron, Philippe Vilgier, De Le Pen √† Le Pen. Une histoire des nationaux et des nationalistes sous la Ve R√©publique, Dominique Martin Morin editions, 1986, p.155 A communist in his teenage years, Fran√ßois Duprat moved to the far right and became a member of the Jeune Nation and the Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN). Strongly opposed to Algerian independence during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62), Duprat later supported Arab states as an anti-Zionist. After the March 1962 Evian agreements granting independence to Algeria, he traveled to Katanga, supporting the secession led by Moise Tshombe. He became Tshome's Director of Propaganda on Radio-Katanga. Thereafter, he returned to France, where he became a member of Occident, which carried out street brawls against the Maoists and other left-wing students. However, he was excluded in 1967, accused of being a police informant.Fr√©d√©ric Charpier, G√©n√©ration Occident : de l'extr√™me droite √† la droite Duprat then took part in the Ordre Nouveau movement (New Order), and became the editor of L'Action europ√©enne (European Action) and of the Revue d‚Äôhistoire du fascisme (History Review of Fascism), which introduced in France Holocaust denial thesis supported by far right circles in the English-world.Henry Rousso, \\"Les habits neufs du n√©gationniste,\\" in L'Histoire n¬∞318, March 2007, pp.26-28 In 1972, Fran√ßois Duprat co-founded the National Front (FN) headed by Jean-Marie Le Pen, and was part of its political bureau until his death in 1978. He represented the hard-liners of the party, and directed the Groupes nationalistes r√©volutionnaires (National Revolutionary Groups), alongside Alain Renault. Revisionist writings Fran√ßois Duprat saw history as a political weapon, stating in May 1976: > We must not let to our opponents, Marxists and r√©gimistes, the monopoly of > the historical representation of men, facts and ideas. Because History is a > wonderful war instrument, and it would be useless to deny that one of the > important reasons of our political hardships resides in the historical > exploitation and the systematic deformation of the nationalist experiences > of the past... It is in order to answer these needs... that a team of > intellectuals, professors and nationalists have created the Revue d'histoire > du fascisme.\\"¬´ Front historique ¬ª, Ann√©e Z√©ro, May 1976.

Duprat wrote a book on far right movements in France from 1940 to 1944, during the Collaborationist regime of Vichy. He also created a number of magazines and political reviews, including the Cahiers d'histoire du fascisme (History Notebooks on Fascism) and the Cahiers Europ√©ens-Notre Europe (European Notebooks - Our Europe), which also circulated denialist books or far right literature exalting the Third Reich. Death Duprat was killed on 18 March 1978, in a car-bomb explosion. His wife Jeanine was also injured in the attack, losing the use of her legs. He was finishing a book titled Argent et politique (Money and Politics) concerning the funding of right-wing and far- right political parties. There are many theories about the assassination, but historian Michel Winock notes that perpetrators and their motives have never been established;Michel Winock, ¬´ Les sources historiques du Front national ¬ª, article repris dans La France politique : XIXe-XXe si√®cle, Paris, √âditions du Seuil, 1999, p. 282. the police investigation into his assassination was inconclusive. A Jewish \\"Remembrance Commando\\" and a \\"Jewish Revolutionary Group\\" immediately claimed responsibility for the murder. The perpetrators of the bombing were never found, while Jean-Pierre Bloch, director of the LICRA anti-racist NGO, condemned the killing. In G√©n√©ration Occident: de l'extr√™me droite √† la droite, Fr√©d√©ric Charpier alleged that the assassination could have been commissioned by a rival far right organisation. He recalled that Duprat had been excluded in 1967 from Occident after allegations that he was a police informant. According to Roger Faligot and Pascal Krop, Duprat was killed for his links with the Syrian government.DST : Police secr√®te (Flammarion, 1999) Shortly before the assassination, Patrice Chairoff had published names and addresses of publishers which were tied to Duprat; one of the addresses happened to be his private residence.Patrice Chairoff, Dossier n√©o-nazisme, Preface by Beate Klarsfeld, √©ditions Ramsay, 1977, page 238, note 141.

The piece was first presented at the Savoy Theatre on 14 February 1888,\\"Mrs. Jarramie's Genie\\", The Era, 18 February 1888, p. 11 as a curtain raiser to the revival of H.M.S. Pinafore (November 1887 ‚Äì March 1888). It was subsequently presented as a curtain raiser to revivals of The Pirates of Penzance (March ‚Äì June 1888) and The Mikado (June ‚Äì September 1888), and then with The Yeomen of the Guard (October 1888 ‚Äì November 1889). No printed libretto or vocal score is found in the British Library, and no libretto is filed in the Lord Chamberlain's collection. The score and orchestra parts were apparently lost at sea in a shipwreck off the west coast of South America in 1892, and in 1910, Helen Carte, the widow of the work's producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, gave the libretto to Desprez.Lamb, Andrew. \\"Comic Opera Goes Latin-American, 1890-92: Part 2\\" in The Gaiety, Winter 2006, p. 46 The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one- act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half- empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen- Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 Setting and plot The scene is the morning room of Mr. Jarramie's house, Harley Street, London. The Era printed this summary of the plot in its review of the first performance: Mr and Mrs Barrington Jarramie are fashionable parvenus who are elevating themselves in society by the lever of politics. Daphne, their daughter, is secretly engaged to one Ernest Pepperton, an enthusiastic young Radical, who has incurred Mr Jarramie's dislike by his unorthodox politics. Mrs Jarramie is anxious about a very particular dinner which she is going to give that day. She has, by patience and diplomacy, secured a duchess as her guest, and Elie (Mrs Jarramie) condones her butler, Smithers's, pilfering of his choice imperial Tokay in order to keep him in good humour on the great occasion. A parcel arrives containing a present from Daphne's sailor cousin, an ancient lamp which he has sent as a bit of bric-a- brac. Daphne thoughtlessly runs out to get Smithers to clean the article, and that worthy soon appears and remonstrates with his mistress on the subject, winding up by giving \\"notice.\\" It seems, however, that the real cause of the resignation is that Smithers has heard that Mr Jarramie is \\"blackballed\\" for the Cerulean Club, for which he had been put up. Mrs Jarramie loses her temper, and mentions the Tokay, and the butler spitefully leaves on the instant, taking his fianc√©e, the cook, with him. Mrs Jarramie is in despair but rubbing the lamp angrily, the room darkens, a vast cloud of smoke fills the air and Ben-Zoh-Leen, the Slave of Aladdin's Lamp, mysteriously appears. After mutual explanations, Mrs Jarramie engages him as cook and butler combined, for by his magic power he can change in a moment from one character to the other. In the twinkling of an eye he appears in the complete dress of a chef and goes about his business. Mr Jarramie comes down, and opens his letters. His Liverpool agents have sent him a combination safe, but have not forwarded the key word by which alone it can be opened. Finding the lamp in an escritoire, he dusts it, and the Genie appears from the kitchen. Mr Jarramie promptly engages him as an electioneering canvasser, and the Slave has to make a change to the orthodox frock-coat and high hat of a politician. Mrs Jarramie's jealousy, which has accidentally been aroused by her husband's late hours, is set aflame by the perusal of a telegram to him which she opens. She mistakes the wording \\"Did you get safe in last night!\\" and the female name which serves as a key-word to the safe, for a communication from a lady; and when she finds that Mr Jarramie has taken her chef away to use him as a canvasser, she orders Ben-Zoh-Leen to take her husband to ‚Äì Timbuctoo. He does so; and then Pepperton explains to Mrs Jarramie the facts of her error. Horror! Mr Jarramie must be brought back. But Mrs Jarramie has carelessly put the lamp in the combination safe, and turned the handle. Ben-Zoh-Leen cannot conscientiously obey any one not \\"holding\\" the lamp, and Mr Jarramie is in an uncomfortable position, as the Genie amicably placed him in the midst of a tribe of natives of cannibalistic propensities. After a certain amount of agony Pepperton finds the letter containing the key-word, the lamp is recovered, and Mr Jarramie restored to the bosom of his family, Pepperton pardoned, and the Genie is given his freedom, and set up in an oil and lamp business, his last service being as a bald-headed and highly respectable butler, to serve up the dinner and announce \\"The Duchess!\\" on which happy termination the curtain drops.

Arthur Daniels was born in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, Wales. In 1945, he was one of three Welshmen, all from the Llanelli area, who had trials with the Halifax rugby league club (Heritage ‚Ññ 546). A , he made a relatively slow start to his rugby league career, which was interrupted with a period in the armed forces. Following a big improvement in his form in 1948‚Äì49, he was by 1949 an important part of the Halifax side. In 1950, he toured Australasia with the Great Britain squad, but injury forced him to return home early before the first test. He made 13 appearances for Wales, scoring nine tries. He was Halifax captain for the 1952/53 season. However, injuries would curtail his season. A splintered ankle bone sustained in the Second Test playing for Great Britain against the touring Australians at Swinton kept him out of the third. A broken arm in a home match against Huddersfield on Christmas Day 1952 ended his season. His domestic career also included two Challenge Cup Final appearances at Wembley. The first was in 1954 when Halifax drew with Warrington, the tie was settled in the famous Odsal replay where he had a try disallowed in a defeat for Halifax. His next Wembley appearance came in 1956 against St. Helens where once again, Halifax were the losing side. International honours Daniels won 13 caps for Wales in 1949‚Äì1953 while at Halifax, and won 3 caps for Great Britain in 1952‚Äì1955 while at Halifax. Challenge Cup Final appearances Arthur Daniels played , i.e. number 2, in Halifax's 4‚Äì8 defeat by Warrington in the 1954 Challenge Cup Final replay during the 1953‚Äì54 season at Odsal Stadium, Bradford on Wednesday 5 May 1954, in front of a record crowd of 102,575 or more. Career highlight All footballers during their career have one match which stands out more prominently than others. When Daniels was asked if there was such a game, he chose the First Test of the 1952 series against Australia at Headingley Rugby Stadium, a game in which he scored his first try at test level, helping to secure a 19‚Äì6 victory. Bradford and retirement The 1956‚Äì57 season was his last at Thrum Hall, after which he had a brief spell with Bradford Northern before his retirement. After retiring, he lived for a time in the Halifax area where he was a publican. He moved to Pudsey and then Bramley, before moving back to Pontyberem. He later ran a newsagents in Swansea. He spent his later years in Neath. Honoured at Halifax Arthur Daniels is a Halifax Hall of Fame inductee.

Un- Scripted Theater Company¬Æ is an improvisational theater company in San Francisco, California. Un-Scripted Theater Company performs many kinds of improv formats, such as comedy, mystery, drama, adventure, and musicals, each presented in 4 to 6 week runs each season, each with its own Director, format, and vision. Un-Scripted specializes in narrative and genre-based \\"single- story\\" improvised theater. History Un-Scripted Theater Company was founded in 2002 when the Thursday night performance group, The Belfry, was cut from the line up at San Francisco's BATS Improv. Determined to continue their performance work, 8 of the original 20 improvisors of The Belfry left and started Un-Scripted Theater Company in January 2003. Since then, Un-Scripted Theater Company has performed hundreds of shows all over the Bay Area, throughout California and across the United States.  Founding Members  *Alan Goy *Brian McBride *Christian Utzman *Cort Worthington *Glenn Etter *Jennifer Kah *Susan Snyder *Tara McDonough Style Un-Scripted Theater Company performs both Shortform and Longform improvisation. Shows are 2 hours long, with one intermission. Improvised theater is rooted in the idea that whatever you can perform with a script, like a play, movie, or musical can also be improvised, with unique and surprising results, which tap into deep universal themes and the innate creativity and individuality of all the players. Organization Un-Scripted Theater Company is a 501c3 non-profit performing arts company. It has a core performing Ensemble, some of whom make up the company's professional staff. Each show typically features two or more guests from outside the Ensemble. Guest Improvisors are chosen by the Director of the show at open auditions, which are held before the start of the show's rehearsal period. Each show has a larger cast size than the number of performers in any given night's show, so the composition of the cast changes each night.

EV certificates can be used in the same manner as any other X.509 certificates, including securing web communications with HTTPS and signing software and documents. Unlike domain- validated certificates and organization-validation certificates, EV certificates can be issued only by a subset of certificate authorities (CAs) and require verification of the requesting entity's legal identity before certificate issuance. By September 2020, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari web browsers show the verified legal identity in their certificate information user interface. They used to display a \\"green bar\\" near or instead (Safari) the URL before August 2019. Mobile browsers typically display EV certificates the same way they do DV and OV certificates. Of the ten most popular websites online, none use EV certificates and the trend is away from their usage. For software, the verified legal identity is displayed to the user by the operating system (e.g., Microsoft Windows) before proceeding with the installation. Extended Validation certificates are stored in a file format specified by and typically use the same encryption as organization-validated certificates and domain-validated certificates, so they are compatible with most server and user agent software. The criteria for issuing EV certificates are defined by the Guidelines for Extended Validation promulgated by the CA/Browser Forum, a voluntary organization whose members include leading CAs and vendors of Internet software as well as representatives from the legal and audit professions. To issue an extended validation certificate, a CA requires verification of the requesting entity's identity and its operational status with its control over domain name and hosting server.  History   Introduction by CA/Browser Forum  In 2005 Melih Abdulhayoglu, CEO of the Comodo Group , convened the first meeting of the organization that became the CA/Browser Forum, hoping to improve standards for issuing SSL/TLS certificates. On June 12, 2007, the CA/Browser Forum officially ratified the first version of the Extended Validation (EV) SSL Guidelines, which took effect immediately. The formal approval successfully brought to a close more than two years of effort and provided the infrastructure for trusted website identity on the Internet. Then, in April 2008, the forum announced version 1.1 of the guidelines, building on the practical experience of its member CAs and relying-party application software suppliers gained in the months since the first version was approved for use.  Creation of special UI indicators in browsers  Most major browsers created special user interface indicators for pages loaded via HTTPS secured by an EV certificate soon after the creation of the standard. This includes Microsoft Edge 12, Google Chrome 1.0, Internet Explorer 7.0, Firefox 3, Safari 3.2, Opera 9.5. Furthermore, some mobile browsers, including Safari for iOS, Windows Phone, Firefox for Android, Chrome for Android, and iOS, added such UI indicators. Usually, browsers with EV support display the validated identity‚Äîusually a combination of organization name and jurisdiction‚Äîcontained in the EV certificate's 'subject' field. In most implementations, the enhanced display includes: * The name of the company or entity that owns the certificate; * A lock symbol, also in the address bar, that varies in color depending on the security status of the website. By clicking on the lock symbol, the user can obtain more information about the certificate, including the name of the certificate authority that issued the EV certificate.  Removal of special UI indicators  In August 2019, Google Chrome 76 and Firefox 70 browsers announced plans to redesign user interfaces to remove emphasis for EV certificates. Firefox 70 removed the distinction in the omnibox or URL bar (EV and DV certificates are displayed similarly with just a lock icon), but the details about certificate EV status are accessible in the more detailed view that opens after click on the lock icon.  Motivation  An important motivation for using digital certificates with SSL/TLS was to add trust to online transactions by requiring website operators to undergo vetting with a certificate authority (CA) in order to get a certificate. However, commercial pressures have led some CAs to introduce \\"domain-validated\\" certificates. Domain-validated certificates existed before validation standards, and generally only require some proof of domain control. In particular, domain-validated certificates do not assert that a given legal entity has any relationship with the domain, although the domain may resemble a particular legal entity. In the past, most browsers' user interfaces did not clearly differentiate between low-validation certificates and those that have undergone more rigorous vetting. Since any successful SSL/TLS connection would cause a green padlock icon to appear in most browsers, users were not likely to be aware of whether the website owner has been validated or not. As a result, fraudsters (including phishing websites) could use TLS to add perceived credibility to their websites. Users of modern browsers can always check the identity of certificate owners by examining the details of the issued certificate which always indicates the certificate owner information such as the name of the organization and its location. EV certificates are validated against both the Baseline Requirements and the Extended Validation requirements, which place additional requirements on how authorities vet companies. These include manual checks of all the domain names requested by the applicant, checks against official government sources, checks against independent information sources, and phone calls to the company to confirm the position of the applicant. If the certificate is accepted, the government- registered serial number of the business, as well as its physical address, are stored in the EV certificate. By establishing stricter issuing criteria and requiring consistent application of those criteria by all participating CAs, EV certificates are intended to restore confidence among users that a website operator is a legally established business or organization with a verifiable identity. That said, there is still the concern that the same lack of accountability that led to the loss of public confidence in domain-validated certificates will lead to lax certification practices that will erode the value of EV certificates as well.  Issuing criteria  Only CAs who pass an independent qualified audit review may offer EV, and all CAs globally must follow the same detailed issuance requirements which aim to: * Establish the legal identity as well as the operational and physical presence of website owner; * Establish that the applicant is the domain name owner or has exclusive control over the domain name; * Confirm the identity and authority of the individuals acting for the website owner, and that documents pertaining to legal obligations are signed by an authorized officer; * Limit the duration of certificate validity to ensure the certificate information is up to date. CA/B Forum is also limiting the maximum re-use of domain validation data and organisation data to maximum of 397 days (must not exceed 398 days) from March 2020 onward. With the exception of Extended Validation Certificates for .onion domains, it is otherwise not possible to get a wildcard Extended Validation Certificate ‚Äì instead, all fully qualified domain names must be included in the certificate and inspected by the certificate authority.  Extended Validation certificate identification  EV certificates are standard X.509 digital certificates. The primary way to identify an EV certificate is by referencing the Certificate Policies extension field. Each issuer uses a different object identifier (OID) in this field to identify their EV certificates, and each OID is documented in the issuer's Certification Practice Statement. As with root certificate authorities in general, browsers may not recognize all issuers. EV HTTPS certificates contain a subject with X.509 OIDs for \`jurisdictionOfIncorporationCountryName\` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3), \`jurisdictionOfIncorporationStateOrProvinceName\` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.2) (optional),\`jurisdictionLocalityName\` (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.1) (optional), \`businessCategory\` (OID: 2.5.4.15) and \`serialNumber\` (OID: 2.5.4.5), with the \`serialNumber\` pointing to the ID at the relevant secretary of state (US) or government business registrar (outside US), as well as a CA-specific policy identifier so that EV-aware software, such as a web browser, can recognize them. This identifier is what defines EV certificate and is the difference with OV certificate.  Online Certificate Status Protocol  The criteria for issuing Extended Validation certificates do not require issuing certificate authorities to immediately support Online Certificate Status Protocol for revocation checking. However, the requirement for a timely response to revocation checks by the browser has prompted most certificate authorities that had not previously done so to implement OCSP support. Section 26-A of the issuing criteria requires CAs to support OCSP checking for all certificates issued after Dec. 31, 2010.  Criticism   Colliding entity names  The legal entity names are not unique, therefore an attacker who wants to impersonate an entity might incorporate a different business with the same name (but, e.g., in a different state or country) and obtain a valid certificate for it, but then use the certificate to impersonate the original site. In one demonstration, a researcher incorporated a business called \\"Stripe, Inc.\\" in Kentucky and showed that browsers display it similarly to how they display certificate of payment processor \\"Stripe, Inc.\\" incorporated in Delaware. Researcher claimed the demonstration setup took about an hour of his time, US$100 in legal costs and US$77 for the certificate. Also, he noted that \\"with enough mouse clicks, [user] may be able to [view] the city and state [where entity is incorporated], but neither of these are helpful to a typical user, and they will likely just blindly trust the [EV certificate] indicator\\".  Availability to small businesses  Since EV certificates are being promoted and reported as a mark of a trustworthy website, some small business owners have voiced concerns that EV certificates give undue advantage to large businesses. The published drafts of the EV Guidelineshttps://www.cabforum.org/Guidelines_v1_2.pdf excluded unincorporated business entities, and early media reports focused on that issue. Version 1.0 of the EV Guidelines was revised to embrace unincorporated associations as long as they were registered with a recognized agency, greatly expanding the number of organizations that qualified for an Extended Validation Certificate. A list of EV certificates with price and features comparison is available for small business to select a cost-effective certificate.  Effectiveness against phishing attacks with IE7 security UI  In 2006, researchers at Stanford University and Microsoft Research conducted a usability study of the EV display in Internet Explorer 7. Their paper concluded that \\"participants who received no training in browser security features did not notice the extended validation indicator and did not outperform the control group\\", whereas \\"participants who were asked to read the Internet Explorer help file were more likely to classify both real and fake sites as legitimate\\". Domain-validated certificates were created by CAs in the first place While proponents of EV certificates claim they help against phishing attacks, security expert Peter Gutmann states the new class of certificates restore a CA's profits which were eroded due to the race to the bottom that occurred among issuers in the industry. Gutmann calls this phenomenon \\"PKI-Me-Harder\\". > The introduction ‚Ä¶ of so-called high-assurance or extended validation (EV) > certificates that allow CAs to charge more for them than standard ones, is > simply a case of rounding up twice the usual number of suspects‚Äîpresumably > somebody‚Äôs going to be impressed by it, but the effect on phishing is > minimal since it is not fixing any problem that the phishers are exploiting. > Indeed, cynics would say that this was exactly the problem that certificates > and CAs were supposed to solve in the first place, and that ‚Äúhigh-assurance‚Äù > certificates are just a way of charging a second time for an existing > service.

The format chosen, which had similarities to beautiful music but primarily used vocals, was commonly known as \\"MOR\\" (middle of the road music) and was syndicated as \\"Format 44\\" around the country. The DJs played several uninterrupted songs followed by a stop-set (commercial break) and then would announce what was heard. Unlike the rock and roll formats of the era, the musical introductions of songs were not talked over and there was usually a little dead air between the songs, all to create an easy-going sound. The jingles used on the air were mainly lengthy cuts provided by Pepper-Tanner (now TM Studios), and in 1974, WHYN-FM was the pilot station for William B. Tanner's \\"Easy Going\\" jingle series. WHYN's long-time morning team consisted of Frank Knight and news man Ron Russell (DeMatteo). A number of other radio personalities worked on the station including Dave Mack, Bob Holland (a/k/a Holland Cooke), Rich Roy (later on WHYN) and others. WHYN-FM continued to program an \\"Easy Listening\\" format late into the seventies. After being purchased by Affiliated Communications, the station's format was switched to a more adult contemporary music format geared towards 18‚Äì54 female demographics. At that point, Frank Knight and Ron Russell exited to be the morning team on Lapin Communications' 1450 WMAS (now WHLL) for that station's Music Of Your Life adult standards format. In the mid-eighties, WHYN-AM-FM was sold to R&R; Broadcasting. The decision was made, by Group Program Director Alan Anderson, to change the call letters to WHFM and program a soft AC format and geared not just to the Springfield media market but also larger, more lucrative Hartford market. The IDs at the top of the hour quietly stated the Springfield city of license and the concept was that the station was THE GIANT, a mythological entity broadcasting down to all of the people. After several months, it became obvious this approach was not working. Larry Caringer, hired by Anderson as assistant program director and morning host was given the reins as PD. With Mary Ferrero as Music Director, the two fashioned a blend of Rock and Pop and within one rating period, WHFM was number one in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. \\"Caringer and Friends\\" was the number one morning show in Springfield. In late 1987, WHFM was sold to Wilks-Schwartz Broadcasting. The purchase of WHYN and WHFM involved a swap, of sorts. FCC rules, at the time, did not allow multiple ownership of stations in a market. So, in order to sell rock-formatted 102.1 WAQY, Wilks-Schwartz had to agree to change the format of their new FM (WHFM) to something that didn't compete with WAQY. At the same time, WHFM reverted to its original WHYN-FM call sign. Much of the air staff and other employees were fired. However, Caringer, Ferrero and Casey Palmer remained on-air. Caringer stayed on as PD through the format change, eventually giving up the position when it became obvious he was no longer the Program Director ‚Äì but, simply an order taker from the consultant in Seattle. \\"Caringer and Friends\\" News Guy, Bill Hess took the PD position. Several weeks later, Hess fired Caringer ‚Äì and took over the morning show. (Ironically, Caringer had just been voted \\"Most Popular Radio Personality\\" by The Valley Advocate.) Ann Strong did mid-days and Casey Palmer was the afternoon jock. Evening DJ Mary Ferrero, who lost her position to Strong, exited to become the Production Director at WMAS-AM-FM and Jennifer Fox took her place. WHYN and WHYN-FM were later sold by Wilks- Schwartz to Radio Equity Partners who later sold to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in 1996. The station hired news guy Tony Gill who had worked in the Boston market at radio stations WBZ and WRKO. He served as Special Assistant to Mayor Ray Flynn's communications office. While at WHYN, Gill was hired by WTIC-TV as a general assignment reporter. WHYN-FM for many years was known as \\"93WHYN\\" and was an adult contemporary station that also blended in oldies from the 1950s and 1960s in with its playlist. The station also aired \\"Jukebox Saturday Night\\", a program DJ Frank Holler started on WDRC-FM, along with an oldies show with Phil D-e-e (Drumheller), which initially aired on Fridays, then moving to Saturdays after the departure of Frank Holler in 1997. The program was moved to WHYN in 1999. The station began evolving into a \\"hot adult contemporary\\" format by the late 1990s, and in 2000, WHYN-FM was rebranded as a \\"Mix\\" station similar to Clear Channel's other \\"Mix\\" stations across the nation. Mix was home to the Dan (Williams) and Kim (Zachary) morning show, which had been broadcasting on Springfield radio for more than 15 years before the two were let go in late 2011. The Dan and Kim morning show originally began on WHYN in 1995 before switching over to the FM in 1997. Dan had gone through a series of morning co-hosts following some ownership and program director changes. Kim replaced Bo Sullivan as Dan's co- host and the show improved in the ratings almost immediately. Evenings were being \\"voice tracked\\" by Jennifer Fox (who was working at Clear Channel in Vermont). Due to budget constraints, they fired her in late 2006 and was replaced by the syndicated John Tesh show at night. Evenings are back to being voicetracked by Cindy Spicer from San Diego. Dan Williams was the longest continual employee of WHYN having started in the mid-seventies when Guy Gannett Broadcasting was the owner and before they split off the radio and television stations.

The field ranges from studying the Sami in relation to the Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish states, to activities of the Danish Colonial Empire and Swedish Empire in Africa and on Caribbean islands such as St. Thomas and Saint-Barth√©lemy. __TOC__ Overview Iceland Some consider Norse Vikings to be the first Europeans to create colonies in the Americas. The arrival of Leif Erikson, of Iceland, in the Americas occurred 500 years before Christopher Columbus, and it was unintentional, as it was said that his ship was blown off-course on the way to Greenland. Erikson established settlements in what is now modern day Newfoundland, Canada as well as what is now Maine in the United States. In the year 999 c. Erikson's father, Erik the Red, was one of the first Europeans to establish colonies in Greenland. Iceland was considered the first European country to create colonies in North America and Greenland. Greenland Greenland did not colonize, however, it was colonized by many different Scandinavian countries. Leif Erikson of Iceland was one of the most famous of the settlers of Greenland, and brought Christianity to the country. Greenland was also later colonized by Norway and later Denmark. Norway The Norwegian flag was raised by Sandefjord Cove on Peter I Island in 1929.http://www.polarhistorie.no/ekspedisjoner/Norvegia%20II Norwegians controlled the company Soci√©t√© du Madal in Portuguese Mozambique, which owned coconut plantations and a palm oil factory. Soci√©t√© du Madal used the forced labor of indigenous peoples to dig canals and drain swamps around the Zambezi to make way for plantations, in addition to operating the plantations themselves. Child laborers on Madal's properties were paid in rotgut spirits, as was common for many companies operating in Mozambique during the colonial period. Christian Thams, a key founder and major shareholder of the company, had Mozambicans in lands the company controlled pay taxes directly to the company rather than the Portuguese colonial government, a venture sometimes more profitable than agricultural operations. Even after independence, thousands of workers continued to produce coconut oil for Madal into the 21st century. As an independent state in modern days, Norway occupied Erik the Red's Land on Greenland from 1931-33. Nils Larsen of Sandefjord's expeditions of Antarctica led to Norway's annexation of Bouvet Island in 1927 and Peter I Island in 1929.http://www.polarhistorie.no/personer/Christensen%2C%20Lars Norway also maintains sovereignty of Queen Maud Land on Antarctica. Grytviken, the largest settlement on South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, was founded by Sandefjordian Carl Anton Larsen in November 1904. Although never Norwegian territories, many settlements throughout the world were established by Norwegians. Examples include the Norwegian Colony in California, Marburg in South Africa, Joinville in Brazil, and Norsewood in New Zealand. Additional former territorial claims have included South Georgia Island, Fridtjof Nansen Land (1926-1929), Sverdrup Islands (1928-1930), and Inari, Finland (1942-1945). Sweden Sweden had colonies in the Americas and in Africa. However, they were not able to hold onto them due to revolts and political purchases. Overall, the Swedish impact on the new world was not as influential as that of the British, Spanish, and Portuguese; however they retained political, cultural, and economic influence over many colonies. Swedish colonies in Africa include: Fort Christiansborg/Fort Frederiksborg (1652-1658), Fort Batenstein (1649-1656), Fort Witsen, (1653-1658), and Carolusberg (1650-1663). Swedish countries in the America‚Äôs include: Guadeloupe (1813‚Äì1814), Saint-Barth√©lemy (1784‚Äì1878), New Sweden (1638‚Äì1655), and Tobago (1733). The colony of New Sweden can be seen as an example of Swedish colonization. Now called Delaware, New Sweden stood to make a considerable profit due to tobacco growth. Denmark The Danes colonized many areas including holdings in Africa, the Americas, the Atlantic, and Asia. The medieval Norwegians colonized much of The Atlantic, including Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, which were later inherited as colonies by the united kingdom of Denmark-Norway. However, both of these nations gradually gained independence and are now fully sovereign within the Danish Empire. In addition, Denmark also colonized parts of \\"The Americas\\", including the Danish West Indies, which was purchased by the United States in 1916, and is now a part of the modern-day U.S. Virgin Islands. Denmark also had trading posts along the gold coast of Africa and India, starting in the early 17th century, but these were sold to the United Kingdom in the mid 19th century  Education  Some American universities offer courses concerning the developing field.Pacific Lutheran University - Topics in Scandinavian Culture & Society: Nordic Colonialism  See also  * Danish colonial empire * Swedish Empire * Swedish slave trade * Dano-Norwegian slave trade * First Finnish Settlement in America: 1638 *First Maps of Delaware, a Swedish Colony in North America *Scandinavian Colonialism and the Rise of Modernity: Small Time Agents in a Global Arena  References  Category:History of European colonialism Category:Former Danish colonies Category:Former Norwegian colonies Category:Former Swedish colonies Category:Scandinavian history Category:History of the Danish colonial empire Category:History of the Swedish colonial empire ","title":"Scandinavian colonialism"},{"id":"7104349","title":"Non so che darei"},{"id":"7104354","text":"Tenzo (Japanese: ÂÖ∏Â∫ß) is a title given to the chef at a Buddhist monastery.

The parties of that era were named after one of the three Great Powers who had together settled the Greek War of Independence in the Treaty of Constantinople (1832). The three rival powers, the Russian Empire, the United Kingdom and July Monarchy France came together in order to check the power of the other two nations. The Russian Party had considerable power, enjoying privileged access to the Orthodox Church, the state machinery, military leaders, and Peloponnesian political families; but it was also popular with a significant section of the common people who wanted a strong centralized government to crush the power of the Greek shipping magnates and the rest of the business class, which followed the English Party.Gunnar Hering ¬´TŒ± Œ†ŒøŒªŒπœÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ KœåŒºŒºŒ±œÑŒ± œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ EŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±, 1821-1936, volume 1¬ª History and party development The Russian Party was more philosophically-grounded than the other two parties. It represented more conservative elements in Greek society and was viewed as being more supportive of the primacy of the Orthodox church in Greek life. It received generous support from the Church and from several military commanders; but its greatest strength were the Peloponnesian families of notables, that enjoyed privileged access to the state machinery. Ioannis Capodistrias, who had served as Foreign Minister in the Russian government, was selected as governor of the newly independent Greek state in 1827. His support came from the Russian representatives in Greece and those Greeks who wanted closer relations with their sister Orthodox country and this grouping was the first modern party in Greece, called the Russian Party. Meanwhile, Capodistrias' rule and attempts to centralize the government alienated a number of his fellow Greek leaders, most of whom were born in Greece and had fought to free Greece from Ottoman control. They began to form themselves into a rival French Party and English Party. Eventually, the rivalries led to the assassination of Capodistrias. After a period of renewed civil war, King Otto was selected by the three Great Powers to become King of Greece in 1833. During the early period of the monarchy, the three parties remained active, although Otto was an absolute monarch. When Otto arrived in Greece, he was a minor and thus a Regency Council made up of three Bavarians ruled in his name. The chief of the Council, Josef Ludwig von Armansperg was a liberal Bavarian and he was perceived as being hostile to the Russian Party. In 1833, the leaders of the Russian Party, including Theodoros Kolokotronis, his son Gennaios and Kitsos Tzavelas, were implicated in a plot to seek Russian influence to remove von Armansperg and allow Otto to rule without a regent. They were arrested and imprisoned. Although eventually released, the leaders of the Russian Party were out of power and influence compared to the other parties until 1837. After this period of decline, the mantle of leadership was placed on Gennaios Kolokotronis, Andreas Metaxas and Konstantinos Oikonomos. The younger Kolokotronis served as a trusted aide-de-camp to King Otto, and began to rehabilitate the Russian Party in the Court. Once Otto was free of the influence of his regents, he began to favor both Kolokotronis and Kitsos Tzavelas and the period 1838-1839 was seen as a period of Russian ascendancy.John A.

The Tantric Hindu temple is dedicated to the goddess Tara, a fearsome Tantric aspect of the Devi, the chief temples of Shaktism. Tarapith derives its name from its association as the most important centre of Tara worship.Kinsley p. 61 Tarapith is also famous for Sadhak Bamakhepa, known as the avadhuta or \\"mad saint\\", who worshipped in the temple and resided in the cremation grounds as a mendicant and practised and perfected yoga and the tantric arts under the tutelage of another famous saint, Kailashpathi Baba. Bamakhepa dedicated his entire life to the worship of Tara Maa. His ashram is also located in bank of Dwaraka river and close to the Tara temple. Geography Location Tarapith is a village of Sahapur Gram Panchayet, Tarapith Police Station located on the banks of the Dwarka River in West Bengal. It is located in the flood plains amidst green paddy fields. It looks like a typical Bengali village with thatched roof huts and fish tanks.Dalrymple, pp. 210-211 The town is located 6 km from Rampurhat Sub-Division in the Birbhum district. \\"Rampurhat\\" and 'Tarapith Road' are the nearest Railway stations. Legend and importance Gateway of Tarapith The Temple of Tarapith There are several legends narrated on the origin and importance of this place, all related to the goddess Tara deified in the Tarapith temple. A well-known legend relates to the Shakti Piths. Sati, the consort of Shiva, felt insulted when her father Daksha did not invite Shiva to the great yaj√±a \\"fire sacrifice\\" he organized. Unable to bear this humiliation, Sati gave up her life by jumping into the yaj√±a fire. Infuriated by this tragic turn of events, Shiva went wild. Then, Vishnu, in order to pacify Shiva, decimated the body of Sati with his chakram. Sati's body part fell all over the Indian subcontinent. The places where the body parts fell have become centres of worship of the Goddess in different manifestations. There are 51 such holy temples which are called Shakti Piths; in West Bengal, there are many such piths, such as the Kalighat.Kinsley p. 109 Vashistha had seen this form and worshipped the goddess Sati in the form of Tara. Another legend narrates: Shiva had drunk the poison that had emerged by the churning of the cosmic oceans, to save the universe. To relieve the intense burning in his throat, Sati ‚Äì in the form of Tara ‚Äì breast fed Shiva to relieve him of the effect of poison in his throat. Another local narration is that Vasishtha chose this place for the worship of Sati as it was already known as a Tarapith.Kinsely, p. 106 Among piths, Tarapith is a siddha pith, which grants enlightenment, wisdom, happiness and siddhis (\\"supernatural powers\\"). Another oral legend about the temple states that sage Vashishtha practised austerities to Tara, but was unsuccessful, so on the advice of a divine voice, he went to meet the Buddha ‚Äì an avatar of Vishnu according to some schools of Hinduism ‚Äì in Tibet. The Buddha instructed Vasishtha to worship Tara through the practices of vamachara. During this time, Buddha had a vision of Tarapith as an ideal location for enshrining the image of Tara in a temple there. Buddha advised Vasishtha to go to Tarapith, the abode of Tara. At Tarapith, Vasishtha did penance by reciting Tara mantra 300,000 times. Tara was pleased with Vasishtha‚Äôs penance and appeared before him. Vasishtha appealed to Tara to appear before him in the form of a mother suckling Shiva on her breast, the form that Buddha had seen in his divine vision. Tara then incarnated herself in that form before Vasishtha and turned into a stone image. Since then Tara is worshipped in the Tarapith temple in the form of a mother suckling Shiva on her breast.Kinsely, p. 106Kinsley pp. 97-8 Tarapith, Kalighat and Nabadwip are considered the most important tirthas (holy places with a sacred water body) for Bengali Hindus. The shrine as a Sidhho Pith - Tara Peetha Shiva carrying the corpse of Sati Devi The shrine gets its name being a Sidhho Pith. Sidhho Pith holy temples of TaraMaa. They are believed to have originated due to the falling of body parts of the corpse of Sati Devi, when Lord Shiva carried it and wandered in sorrow. There are 51 Shakti Peeth all over South Asia is linked to the 51 letters in Sanskrit. The Shakti Peethas are associated with the mythology of Daksha yaga and Sati's self immolation. These shrines are important place of worship for Tantra practitioners. Tarapith temple Maa Mundamalini at Mundamalini Temple in Tarapith The Tara temple in Tarapith steeped in the narrated myths is a medium-sized temple in the rural precincts of Bengal. Its fame as a pilgrimage centre with the deity of Tara enshrined in it is due to \\"the temple‚Äôs founding myths, its type of worship (which includes blood offerings), the hymns sung there, the powers of the nearby tank, and the inhabitants and rituals of the adjacent cremation ground\\".Kinsely, p. 108 The temple base is thick with thick walls, built of red brick. The superstructure has covered passages with many arches raising to the pinnacle with a spire (shikara). The image of the deity is enshrined under the eaves in the sanctum. There are two Tara images in the sanctum. The stone image of Tara depicted as a mother suckling Shiva ‚Äì the \\"primordial image\\" (seen in the inset of the fierce form of the image of Tara) is camouflaged by a three feet metal image, that the devotee normally seen. It represents Tara in her fiery form with four arms, wearing a garland of skulls and a protruding tongue. Crowned with a silver crown and with flowing hair, the outer image wrapped in a sari and decked in marigold garlands with a silver umbrella over its head. The forehead of the metal image is adorned with red kumkum (vermilion). Priests take a speck of this kumkum and apply it on the foreheads of the devotees as a mark of Tara's blessings. The devotees offer coconuts, bananas and silk saris, and unusually bottles of whisky.Dalrymple, p. 211Kinsely, p. 110 The primordial image of Tara has been described as a \\"dramatic Hindu image of Tara‚Äôs gentler aspect\\". The priests of the temple offer puja (worship) with great reverence to bring out her motherly aspect to the devotees, blending the North Indian fierce depiction of the Sati myth of the goddess with the peaceful motherly visionary form of Tara seen by Buddha and his disciple Vasishtha of the Tantric tradition ‚Äì the Buddhist Tara form.Kinsely, p. 109 At Tarapith, though the softer motherly aspect of the fierce goddess is emphasized. Chanting hymns or poems in her praise is also a part of the devotional appeal made to the goddess. The devotees take a holy bath at the sacred tank adjacent to the temple before entering the temple premises to offer worship and even after the worship. The waters of the tank are said to have healing powers and even restore life to the dead. Blood sacrifice of goats is the daily norm in the temple. Devotees who offer such goat sacrifices seek blessings from the deity. They bathe the goats in the holy tank near the temple before the sacrifice. They also purify themselves by taking bath in the holy tank before offering worship to the deity. The goat is then tethered to a stake, the designated post in a sand pit, and the neck of the goat butchered with a single stroke by a special sword. A small quantity of the blood of the goat is then collected in a vessel and offered to the deity in the temple. The devotees also smear their forehead with a bit of blood from the pit, as a mark of reverence to the deity.Kinsely, p. 110 Cremation ground Cremation ground at Tarapith The cremation ground (maha smasan), amidst dark forest surroundings, is located on the river side at the end of town limits, away from the village life and practices of the Bengali social order. In Bengal, the cremation ground of Tarapith is also considered integral to the Shakti pith. It is believed that goddess Tara can be seen in shadows drinking blood of goats which are sacrificed every day at her altar, to satiate her anger and seek favours.Dalrymple, p. 205 Tantric practitioners believe that Tara is attracted to bones and skeletons and the cremation ground is her preferred residence. Goddess Tara's iconographic depictions show her amidst cremation grounds. Tantric practitioners have, therefore, been flocking these grounds for generations for performing their Tantric sadhana (spiritual practice); many Sadhus permanently reside here.Kinsely, p. 111 The cremation grounds are flowed by the \\"dread locked ash-smeared sadhus\\". Sadhus have built their hutments, amidst banyan trees and embellished their huts with red- painted skulls embedded into the mud walls. In addition, calendar pictures of Hindu goddesses, saints of Tarapith and a trishul (trident) decorated with marigold garlands and skulls at the entrance are a common sight in front of the huts. Human as well as animal skulls like those of jackals and vultures ‚Äì which are unfit for Tantric rites ‚Äì and snake skins decorate the huts. Good skulls used for tantric rituals and for drinking purpose by the Tantrics are cured before use; skulls of virgins and people who have committed suicide are said to be powerful.Dalrymple, p. 206 Bamakhepa Bamakhepa, the tantric saint of Tarapith in the 19th century A saint, held in great reverence in Tarapith and whose shrine is also located in the vicinity of the Tara temple, was Bamakhepa (1837‚Äì1911) popularly known as the \\"mad saint\\". Bama-khepa, literally means the mad (\\"khepa\\") follower of \\"left handed\\" (\\"Bama\\" or \\"Vama\\" in Sanskrit) path ‚Äì the Tantric way of worship. Bamakhepa, goddess Tara's ardent devotee lived near the temple and meditated in the cremation grounds. He was a contemporary of another famous Bengali saint Ramakrishna. At a young age, he left his house and came under the tutelage of a saint named Kailsahpathi Baba, who lived in Tarapith. He perfected yoga and Tantric sadhana (worship), which resulted in his becoming the spiritual head of Tarapith. He also went to Devi Moulakhsi Temple at maluti village for worship. People came to him seeking blessings or cures for their illness, in distress or just to meet him. He did not follow the set rules of the temple and as result was even once roughed up by the temple priests for taking food meant as offering for the deity. It is said: Tara appeared in the dream of Maharani (\\"Queen\\") of Natore- Rani Annadasundari Devi and told her to feed the saint first as he was her son. After this incident, Bamakhepa was fed first in the temple before the deity and nobody obstructed him. It is believed that Tara gave a vision to Bamakhepa in the cremation grounds in her ferocious form and then took him to her breast.

Playing career Aldershot Reynolds was born in Haslemere and started his career at Aldershot as a 17‚Äìyear old in 1945. While a 22-year-old goalkeeper with Aldershot, Reynolds wrote to Southampton asking for a trial but unfortunately Saints declined this offer and he instead went to White Hart Lane initially as the understudy to Ted Ditchburn. Tottenham Hotspur During his spell at Tottenham, Portsmouth had tried to sign him, but Reynolds was considered too valuable to be released and it wasn't until ten years after he had first contacted Southampton that Ted Bates, beating the transfer deadline by 24 hours, bought him from Spurs for ¬£10,000. Reynolds played 138 first team games for Tottenham Hotspur including 86 League matches, 9 F.A. Cup the rest being Friendly, Tour and Representative games. official Encyclopedia of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. Tony Matthews Southampton Reynolds' composure and experience became a vital ingredient as Southampton went on to lift the Division 3 championship at the end of the 1959‚Äì1960 season. Reynolds was in goal in a memorable match on 5 December 1960, in the League Cup round 4 at home to Leeds United ‚Äì he went off after 19 minutes, injured when diving bravely at the feet of the Leeds centre-forward, John McCole. He was replaced in goal by Cliff Huxford who conceded four goals; fortunately for Southampton, Derek Reeves scored all five goals for the home side, who ran out 5‚Äì4 victors. He broke his ankle in the first match of the 1961‚Äì62 season, at home to Plymouth Argyle on 19 August. He was replaced in goal, firstly by Terry Paine who let in 2 goals and was in turn replaced by Huxford. Reynolds took no further part in that season but fought his way back into the first team and was re-established as first choice keeper at the start of the next season. Unfortunately, his career was terminated by a dislocated shoulder sustained at Fratton Park on 28 September 1963 ‚Äì again Huxford took over in goal as substitutes were still not available. Reynolds was one of the first professional footballers to have worn contact lenses. Retirement After his injury, Ron scouted briefly for Saints and Crystal Palace, before joining a firm of insurance brokers in 1964. He later set up his own brokers business in Haslemere. Memorabilia He died on his 71st birthday (2 June 1999), and upon clearing out his house his family discovered a meticulously kept archive of Reynolds' professional career - cupboards, shoeboxes and carrier bags full of notebooks, programmes, ticket stubs, press cuttings, photographs, souvenirs from foreign tours and Reynolds' own match reports of all his games. He had gathered a collection of memorabilia providing a rare insight into the world of the 1950s footballer. It was the era of the maximum wage, a time when players could not leave their club without the express say-so of their bosses; employers had a serfs and masters mentality, which was famously described as 'soccer slavery' by Jimmy Hill. Reynolds himself was quite a character - fastidious and outspoken he was a formidable PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) representative and was behind many of the perceived insurrections of his more famous soul-mate Danny Blanchflower, with whom he shared a passion for the glory of the game. His strength of character made him a natural champion of employee's rights, but this sense of purpose was also ideal in his career as a goalkeeper. In 2003, his son, David, published a collection of his late father's memoirs. In the book he reports an incident of \\"tapping-up\\" ‚Äì whilst at Southampton, he was astonished to be contacted by the great Alf Ramsey over a possible transfer to Ipswich Town.

In the formation, layers of fine-grained volcanic ash punctuate a sequence of carbonate muds that were accumulating in a marine environment on the outer continental shelf. In this fine-grained matrix, soft- bodied animals and delicate, lightly sclerotized chitinous shells are often preserved in three dimensions, as calcitic fossilizations within calcareous nodules. Calcitic fossilization is an unusual feature. The lagerst√§tte, discovered and first published in 1996, provides a wider representation of organisms than conventional fossilizations of shelly and bony elements. The Wenlock Series offers a diverse macrofauna that includes polychaete worms (Kenostrychus), sponges, graptolites, starfish, a chelicerate (Offacolus), a stem-group mandibulate (Aquilonifer) and a vermiform mollusc (Acaenoplax). On the microscopic scale the diverse microfauna includes abundant well-preserved radiolarians. The delicate Wenlock fossils are difficult to separate from split sections, so Mark Sutton and his team have devised a method of serially grinding sections; from digital photographs three-dimensional \\"digital fossils\\" are reconstructed from datasets.

Features Graphics RPG Maker 2 was the first RPG Maker game to use fully 3D graphics, however, the graphical quality of the game suffered‚Äîduring movement, a visible 'blur' was present. The game uses super deformed character models outside of battle, and more realistic (though still fairly cartoony) models in battle. By going online, or using the Prima guide, users can access various fan pages, and (with practice and effort) create a playable game. Events Events, like in other RPG Makers, drive your cutscenes, boss battles and other effects. Events are tied to a script, like in many computer programming languages. There is a multitude of script commands to do a lot of tasks. Unfortunately, some commands are placed in almost random categories. Many fans of the first game found the style of event creation and placement to be a downgrade from the original. Instead of selecting where the event is to be placed on the map, then creating the script and the event at the same time, the player had to create the script, tie it to an event, then place the event on the map, while opening and closing many menus in the process.

Users could create their own music, but such requires a great deal of practice and musical skill. Enhancements from RPG Maker for PS1 RPG Maker 2 was the first console RPG Maker to feature fully 3D graphics, thus you could move in any direction simply by manipulating the analog stick.

The PlayStation 2's USB port also allows the use of a USB Keyboard, speeding up the process of writing text. However, because RPG Maker 2 includes 3D graphics instead of 2D, programs like the Anime Maker for RPG Maker were not included in RPG Maker 2. FuMa FuMa is the sample game given in RPG Maker 2.

While his efforts were praised at the time, he has borne the brunt of blame for introducing this pest to Australia.Special Broadcasting Service  See also  *Rabbits in Australia References Bibliography *Australian Dictionary of Biography ‚Äì Thomas Austin *Australian Dictionary of Biography ‚Äì Elizabeth Austin *Australian Heritage (Autumn 2006) article on Thomas Austin & rabbits Category:1815 births Category:1871 deaths Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia Category:People from Somerset ","title":"Thomas Austin"},{"id":"7104524","title":"I treni di Tozeur"},{"id":"7104529","text":"RPG Maker 3 is the fourth PlayStation version of the RPG Maker series. It is the second game in the series released on the PlayStation 2. The game was also released on the PlayStation 3 on April 16, 2013 through the PlayStation Network. Features RPG Maker 3 features an advanced trigger system, different layouts for areas, and a variety of other features that requires extensive time to learn. 'Event' commands return, with several upgrades, such as 'conditional' events. Graphics The graphics in RPG Maker 3 are fully 3D. There are more than 20 character models, 50 enemy models, and several different terrain types. The program also contains a set of choices for all buildings and a large set of layouts for towns and dungeons. Because the program uses a 'database' structure to store data, users are limited to a certain number of placeable objects in an area. Events RPG Maker 3 uses an advanced trigger system to activate events through the game. Users select the unit, building, or object they wish to place a trigger to and enter the event editor. In the event editor, objects are set up so that when the player touchesmop it any number of effects can be triggered; item or treasure gains, boss battles, location changes, etc. Up to 50 events can be chained on objects allowing cinematic routines. The event creation process is also much simpler than its predecessor, where you can create the script to the event while you are creating and placing the event, where as in RPG Maker 2, you had to create the script, assign it to an event, then place the event. Music RPG Maker 3 features a music system containing around 40-50 premade pieces of music. There are 8 game themes, several nature sounds, many tracks, and several different battle musics. These pieces were later remastered and released as in the RPG Maker 3 Music Pack add-on for the PC based RPG Maker engines. It can be purchased at the English RPG Maker website. Items RPG Maker 3 classifies its items into four main categories: Items, Treasures, Weapons, and Armor. * Items are usable items. Their effects range from healing to increasing stats to damaging the enemy. There is a variety of premade items such as potions and other amenities common to RPGs. * Treasures are items used to open doors, trigger events, keys, and progress in the storyline. Common usage of treasures are when a boss is defeated, when a character joins the party, or when a major event occurs. * Weapons are items used to be equipped by characters. When designing weapons, users select the attack bonus, the graphics for the weapon, and which characters can wield it. * Armors are the other type of equipped item. These items increase defense and magic defense, and sometimes give other useful bonuses. Like weapons, users choose a graphic, extent of effect, and who can wield it. World design The RPG Maker 3 world consists of three types of areas. Field Maps (the 'overworld' map common to many RPGs), Town Maps (where players purchase equipment and talk with NPCs), and Dungeon Maps (for fighting monsters and solving quests). Each is used for specific purposes and holds its own unique features. * Field Maps are the 'overworld' of an RPG. On the field maps, monster parties can be designed to attack the player's character. Different monsters can be set to appear on different terrain type. Entry points for towns and dungeons are placed here as well. * Town Maps are the main area where events take place. People, stores and launch pads can be placed in a town map. Launch pads allow the player to be teleported to other towns or dungeons for a set fee. * Dungeon Maps are where boss battles and secret items are usually placed. Dungeons are designed on a twenty-floor system, with the tenth floor being the highest and floor B10 being the lowest. Within each floor, the designer can place traps, treasure chests, stairways, secret passages, and one secret door to take the player to another part of the world.

Biography  Rivero was born in Havana, Cuba. He is the grandson of Don Nicolas Rivero, who in 1832 founded the newspaper El Diario de la Marina, and the son of Pepin Rivero, who took over the newspaper upon the death of Don Nicolas in 1919. In 1960 the Cuban government confiscated the newspaper and Jose Ignacio Rivero left into exile where he continued his journalistic career in Spain and the United States.  Journalism  Among the many honors Rivero received for his dedication and journalistic works are: The Grand Cross of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes, the Gold Medal of the Cuban Society of International Law and the Great Cross of Isabel the Catholic. The Vatican granted Rivero distinctions Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and Pro Ecclesia et Pontifex. In exile, Rivero humbly received from the Inter American Press Association (IAPA), the award of Hero of Freedom Award Press and the Mergenthaler Award. The U.S. government also awarded Rivero the Diploma of Honor Lincoln-Marti. Finally, in June 2011, he received the Cuban Heritage Award at the University of Miami. Rivero's memoirs, Prado y Teniente Rey and Contra Viento y Marea Memorias de un Periodista: Periodismo y Mucho Mas, 1920‚Äì2004, recount his experiences as director of the Diario La Marina (Navy Newspaper) newspaper, the circumstances leading to his exile, and his ongoing activism on behalf of freedom of the press. A rally, in Rivero's honor, was held on November 17, 1963, by Dr. Emilio Nunez-Portuondo in preparation for a visit by John F. Kennedy to Miami. The visit, which was aimed at dialoguing with members of the Inter-American Press Association, was able to generate an audience of \\"approximately 6,000 to 8,000 Cubans\\" according to United States Secret Service estimates. Rivero lived in Miami, Florida, where he wrote for the Spanish language newspaper Diario Las Americas until his death on August 3, 2011.

The lobby and teller windows retain decor commonly found in bank lobbies during the early 20th century. National Bank of Alaska (originally known as Bank of Alaska) was Alaska's largest financial institution for the latter part of the 20th century. In 2000, it was purchased by Wells Fargo, giving the larger bank a presence in 23 states. Founding and early history Bank of Alaska was founded in 1916 by Andrew Stevenson in Skagway, Alaska. The bank's first headquarters were in the building previously occupied by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at Fifth and Broadway, but it soon built a new headquarters one block away at Sixth and Broadway, a building which has remained in the possession of the company and its successors to this day. Bank of Alaska soon opened additional branches in Wrangell and Anchorage, which had just been named. Edward Anton Rasmuson, who was hired in the first year as the bank's attorney, and his family and descendants long played central roles in the bank's governance. He assumed control in the financial turmoil following World War I, and by 1919, he was serving as the bank's president. His wife, Jenny Olson Rasmuson, sat on the board of directors. In 1945, the bank's headquarters were moved to Anchorage. Rasmuson died in 1949, and left the bank to his son, Elmer E. Rasmuson. Expansion Sitka. St. Michael's Cathedral and the Cathedral Apartments are in the background. In 1950, the bank adopted a national charter, becoming the National Bank of Alaska. A 1960 merger made National Bank of Alaska the largest bank in the state with 19 branches in six locations. Elmer Rasmuson also passed the business to his son, retiring in 1975. Edward Bernard Rasmuson became president and CEO. By 1978, National Bank of Alaska was operating 34 branches in 19 communities. In 1982, it was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of bank holding company National Bancorp of Alaska. By 1983, its assets topped $1 billion, and by 1990, it owned about half of all bank assets in the state. Wells Fargo purchase In December 1999, National Bancorp of Alaska agreed to a $907 million buyout by Wells Fargo & Co. It had more than $3 billion in assets, and 53 National Bank of Alaska branches in 29 Alaskan communities, with an additional branch in Seattle, Washington. The acquisition transaction closed in 2000, and branches converted to the Wells Fargo brand in June 2001.

The aircraft is famous for dropping the X-15 aerospace research vehicle on 106 of the 199 X-15 program flights.  History  Balls 8 was originally an RB-52B that was first flown on June 11, 1955, and entered service with NASA on June 8, 1959. It was modified at North American Aviation's Palmdale facility to enable it to carry the X-15. As on its NB-52A predecessor, a pylon was installed beneath the right wing between the fuselage and the inboard engines with a section removed from the wing flap to accommodate the X-15's tail. The modified bomber flew 159 captive-carry and launch missions for the X-15 program from June 1959 until October 1968. It was first used to launch the X-15 on its fifth flight, January 23, 1960. It also flew missions for the X-24, HiMAT, Lifting Body vehicles, X-43, early launches of the OSC Pegasus rocket, and numerous other programs. At its retirement on 17 December 2004, Balls 8 was the oldest active B-52 in service, and the only active B-52 that was not an H model. It also had the lowest total airframe time of any operational B-52. It is on permanent public display near the north gate of Edwards Air Force Base in California. It derives its nickname from its NASA tail number 52-008: leading zeroes plus the number 8. Among USAF personnel, it is common practice to refer to aircraft whose tail number contains two or more zeros as \\"Balls\\" and the last digit (or two digits) of its tail number.Balls 8 has \\"0008\\" on its nose... has \\"008\\" on its tail... has \\"52-008\\" stenciled on the left emergency hatch door... but, the manufacturer's plate has not been confirmed.

In the technologically important case of Si, a thin film of a-Si is deposited onto a substrate, usually glass, and then capped with a metal, such as aluminium (Aluminum-induced crystallization(AIC)). The structure is then annealed at temperatures between 150 ¬∞C and 400 ¬∞C which causes the a-Si films to be transformed into polycrystalline silicon. In a variant of this method, called Metal-induced lateral crystallization (MILC), metal is only deposited on some area of the a-Si. Upon annealing, crystallization starts from the portion of a-Si which is covered by metal and proceeds laterally. Unlike MIC process, where metal contamination in the obtained polysilicon is relatively high, the laterally crystallized silicon in MILC process contains very small amount of metal contamination. The crystallization speed is low, but is adequate for applications such as fabrication of thin film transistors. In this case, metal is deposited on the source/drain area of the transistor and the channel is laterally crystallized. It has been also shown that applying an electric field increases the speed of lateral crystallization dramatically. Moreover, the crystallization proceeds unidirectionally. Recently metal-induced crystallization has been coupled with microwave- assisted crystallization lowering the crystallization temperature and time of amorphous titania. By suspending the amorphous powder in a salty solution containing one of various d-block or p-block elements, and microwaving, crystallization can be induced within a few minutes. It is believed that the combined effect of metal migration in the oxide network and the bond vibrations during microwave irradiation lead to rapid and low-temperature crystallization.

He was also a lifelong Zionist and renowned as a master networker. He was on good terms with popes, prime ministers and presidents and put his connections to good use for diplomatic and philanthropic ends. Early life George Weidenfeld was born in Vienna, Austria in 1919,Oliver Marre, \\"A man whose life has been an open book\\", The Observer, 28 June 2009. He was the only son of Max and Rosa Weidenfeld. Weidenfeld attended the University of Vienna and the city's Diplomatic College. Following the Anschluss (Germany's annexation of Austria) in 1938, he emigrated to London, with limited English and a 16/6d postal order (approximately ¬£32.46 in 2019). He began work with the monitoring service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Career By 1942 he was a political commentator for the BBC and also wrote a weekly newspaper column, coming into contact with General de Gaulle and Tito as a result. In 1949, Weidenfeld served for a year as the political adviser and Chief of Cabinet to Chaim Weizmann, the first President of Israel. In that role, Weidenfeld launched a campaign to convince the world that Israel should keep western Jerusalem. The city had been divided between Israel and the Hashemite Kingtom of Transjordan after the two sides signed an armistice agreement earlier in the year. Publishing career In 1948, Weidenfeld co-founded the publishing firm Weidenfeld & Nicolson with Nigel Nicolson. Intending to start an upmarket political magazine, a mix of the New Statesman, Fortune and The New Yorker, they found that the post-war paper shortage made a book publishing concern more feasible, and the new firm was partly intended as a cover for the impractical magazine. Over the years, the firm published many outstanding titles, including the British edition of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita in 1959 and Nicolson's biography of his parents, Portrait of a Marriage (1973). In 1985, Weidenfeld's publishing interests expanded to the United States, when he acquired the Grove Press in partnership with Ann Getty (wife of Gordon Getty). Grove later merged with the New York division of Weidenfeld & Nicolson to form Grove Nicolson. In 1991 Weidenfeld & Nicolson's UK branch was sold to the Orion Publishing Group and became Orion's main non-fiction imprint, with Weidenfeld as non-executive chairman. In 1993, the American company, Grove Nicolson, merged with the Atlantic Monthly Press to form Grove/Atlantic Inc. In 2005 he arranged the publication of Memory and Identity by John Paul II. Weidenfeld was also Joint Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Blavatnik School of Government in Oxford; Adviser to the Board of Axel Springer AG Berlin and a columnist for the Berlin newspapers Die Welt, Welt am Sonntag and Bild Zeitung. In January 2006 the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, founded as The Club of Three in the 1990s, was established with Weidenfeld as its Leadership Programme in Oxford and, in 2010, founded the Humanitas Programme of Visiting Chairs at Oxford and Cambridge. Philanthropy Weidenfeld served in many philanthropic capacities including Chairman of the Ben Gurion University of the Negev (1996‚Äì2004), Governor of the Weizmann Institute, Vice- Chairman of the EU-Israel Forum, member of the Founding Council of the Rothermere American Institute at the University of Oxford, Trustee, Royal Opera House (1974‚Äì87) and Trustee of the National Portrait Gallery (1988‚Äì95). He co-founded the Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Trust at Oxford University, one of the largest post-graduate scholarship programmes at Oxford. He also established the \\"Weidenfeld Safe Havens Fund\\", which intends to support Christians fleeing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant,\\"British Jew who fled Nazis funds rescue of Christians fleeing ISIS\\" in Haaretz, 16 July 2015. although its focus on Christians has caused some criticism.Danny Wiser, \\"Jewish peer who fled Nazis funds operation to rescue Syrian and Iraqi Christians\\", Catholic Herald, 15 July 2015. Awards and honours Weidenfeld became a British citizen in 1947, was knighted in 1969, and created a life peer on 25 June 1976 taking the title Baron Weidenfeld, of Chelsea in the County of Greater London. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for public service. Further honours included Honorary Fellow of St Peter's College, Oxford, Hon. Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, Hon. Fellow, King's College London, and Honorary D.Litt. from the University of Exeter. He was made an Honorary Senator of Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t, Bonn, in 1996 and awarded the Degree of Doctor of Letters, honoris causa, by Oxford University in 2010. He was appointed Knight Commander Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (1991), the Austrian Cross of Honour First Class for Arts and Science (2002), the Decoration of Honour in Gold for Services to the County of Vienna (2003), the Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (2005) and the Order of Merit of Baden-W√ºrttemberg (2008). The Bene Merito honorary badge was awarded by the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2011. He received the London Book Fair/Trilogy Lifetime Achievement Award for International Publishing in 2007 and the Teddy Kollek Life Achievement Award in Jerusalem in 2009. Personal life With Molly Parkin at a party for After Dark in 1991 Weidenfeld married Jane Sieff in 1952, daughter of Israel Sieff, Baron Sieff who was a part of the family that controlled Marks and Spencer. Before their divorce in 1955 they had a daughter, Laura Weidenfeld (b. 1953). After their divorce, he married Barbara Skelton (1916‚Äì1996), the English memoirist, novelist and socialite, in 1956, who had previously been married to Cyril Connolly.

She is best known for her time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Shine Wrestling and the Mexican Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA) promotions. She formerly teamed with Lacey to form The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew (a play on the name of The Minnesota Wrecking Crew), but following Lacey's retirement, she teamed with British wrestler Jetta to form The International Home Wrecking Crew. Rain was also the inaugural Shine Champion. Professional wrestling career Early career Maxon started working for a local promotion, Steel Domain Wrestling (SDW) in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Later, after gaining the experience of a wrestler, she began working for various promotions in the Midwest, such as IWA Mid-South, Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), NWA Midwest, Ring of Honor (ROH), Shimmer Women Athletes, and Women's Extreme Wrestling under the ring name Rain. Shimmer Women Athletes (2005‚Äì2009; 2018) On November 6, 2005, Rain made her debut for Shimmer Women Athletes on the promotion's debut show, losing to Ariel. She picked up her first victory in the promotion on Volume 3, which was taped on February 12, 2006, defeating Nikki Roxx. On May 21 on Volume 6, the team of Rain and Lacey, known collectively as The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew, made their debut as a tag team, defeating Sara Del Rey and Mercedes Martinez. After another tag team victory on Volume 8 against Cheerleader Melissa and MsChif, Rain entered the Shimmer Championship tournament on Volume 11 on June 1, 2007, but was eliminated in the first round by Nikki Roxx. The following day on Volume 13, the Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew suffered its first loss in a match against Del Rey and Roxx. On October 13, Rain and Lacey were joined by Jetta, and together they formed the stable The International Home Wrecking Crew. In their debut match as a trio, they were defeated by Daizee Haze, MsChif and Eden Black. On April 26, 2008, on Volume 18, Rain and Lacey were defeated by the team of Ashley Lane and Nevaeh. After Lacey's retirement, Rain and Jetta continued teaming together, and on Volume 21, taped on October 19, 2008, they entered a gauntlet match to determine the first ever Shimmer Tag Team Champions. The team entered the match fourth and eliminated Jennifer Blake and LuFisto, before being eliminated by the eventual winners, Ashley Lane and Nevaeh. On Volume 23, Rain and Jetta faced Lane and Nevaeh in a two out of three falls match for the tag team titles. During the match, Lacey's debuted as Rain and Jetta's new manager and helped them score the first fall. Lane and Nevaeh came to back to even the score, after Lacey's second interference backfired, but Jetta scored the deciding fall after using a chain given to her by Lacey. However, after referee Bryce Remsburg found out that Jetta had cheated to win, he restarted the match and Lane and Nevaeh ultimately retained the titles. On April 15, 2018, Rain return to Shimmer on Volume 104 accompanied by Lacey, where she unsuccessfully challenged Saraya Knight. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007‚Äì2008) Maxon appeared as a planted fan on the October 18, 2007 episode of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)'s Impact!, holding up a sign reading \\"President of Robert Roode Fan Club\\". She continued to appear in the crowd with pro-Roode signs for the following two weeks. On the November 1 episode of Impact!, Maxon's presence was acknowledged by TNA announcers, and she also had a stare-down with Roode's former valet, Ms. Brooks. In the aftermath of a match on an episode of Impact!, after Ms. Brooks and Roode defeated Chris Harris and Gail Kim, Brooks was about to leave the ring when she attacked and started a fight with Maxon. Following the altercation, she was seen from far distances around the TNA Impact Zone in backstage segments. She was referred as Ms. Brooks's stalker by TNA commentators Don West and Mike Tenay. Maxon made a further appearance on the January 10, 2008 episode of Impact! and attacked Brooks. Subsequently, Roode announced that she had been replaced by Maxon, under the new name (Ms.) Peyton Banks (later tweaked to Payton Banks), resulting in a feud with Brooks and a match at Against All Odds, which Brooks won. At Destination X, Banks was part of the \\"Stand By Your Man\\" Strap match, where she was in the corner of Roode, and Brooks was in the corner of Booker T. The match stipulation dictated that the loser of the match would have their valet whipped with a strap. Booker T lost the match, and Banks whipped Brooks with the leather strap until Brooks was saved by Booker's wife, Sharmell. At Lockdown, Booker T and Sharmell defeated Roode and Banks in a mixed tag team match. After the match, Roode verbally abused Banks in the ring and prepared to hit her, but instead left her alone in the ring. Following the angle with Roode, Maxon left TNA. Asistencia, Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (2009‚Äì2010) On August 21, 2009, at Verano de Escandalo, Rain made her debut for Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) as a member of La Legi√≥n Extranjera, led by Konnan. In the promotion she regularly teams with Jennifer Blade and Sexy Star as well as acting as the valet of Alex Koslov. At the 2010 Rey de Reyes show Rain, Christina Von Eerie and Sexy Star faced off against Cinthia Moreno, Mari and Faby Apache, a match which Moreno won for her team by pinning Sexy Star. During a post Rey de Reyes interview Sexy Star claimed that the Apaches and Cintia Moreno were nothing but maids, which led to AAA booking a match between Cinthia Moreno, Faby and Mari Apache against Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade in a Tripleman√≠a XVIII match where the person pinned or submitted would have to be the winning team's slave for a month. At Tripleman√≠a La Legi√≥n defeated Moreno and the Apaches, when Blade pinned Mari, thanks in part to the biased refereering by Hijo del Tirantes. Following the match Konnan ordered Mari Apache to begin her maid duty right away by cleaning up their dressing room. The stipulation expired on July 6, 2010. Rain's contract with AAA expired on July 25, 2010. Wrestlicious (2009‚Äì2010) In early 2009 Maxon took part in the tapings of Wrestlicious, under the ring name Felony, which began airing in March 2010. She debuted on March 1 in the first episode teaming with Maria Toro and Bandita defeating the team of Cousin Cassie, Tyler Texas and Charlotte. On the April 7 edition of Takedown, Felony was one of the last two girls along with Glory standing in a 20-girl over-the-top-rope \\"Hoedown Throwdown\\" battle royal to determine the top two contenders for the Wrestlicious Championship. On the May 24 episode of Wrestlicious Takedown, Felony lost the Wrestlicious Championship match to Glory. Women Superstars Uncensored (2009‚Äì2012) Rain debuted in WSU in January 2009 with two victories over Rachel Summerlyn on separate DVD tapings in one night. She would go on to defeat Malia Hosaka at WSU's 2 year anniversary show. She went to the finals of WSU's 2009 J-Cup but lost to Angel Orsini in the finals. The following night she received her first WSU Championship shot in a three-way match involving Orsini and champion Mercedes Martinez in which Mercedes retained her title. Rain picked up a win over Nikki Roxx in June and in August, she teamed up with Orsini to challenge for the WSU tag team titles which they lost via DQ. Later that night on WSU's second DVD taping, the duo were successful against Nikki Roxx & Mercedes Martinez. Rain and Orsini's partnership would not last long and they would become enemies again. On October 3, 2009, Rain defeated Angel Orsini in an uncensored rules match. Rain would go on to defeat Portia Perez to become the #1 contender to the WSU Championship. Rain would face Mercedes Martinez for the title in the main event of WSU's 3 year anniversary show in March 2010. Mercedes successfully defended her title against Rain, defeating her in an uncensored rules match on March 6, 2010. Rain would main event WSU's next show which was the first of two tapings in a loss to Awesome Kong. Rain would form her own alliance known as Rain's Army with Nikki Roxx and Jessicka Havok later in 2010. At WSU's first ever internet pay per view, Breaking Barries, Rain picked up an impressive victory over Jamilia Craft in just 3 minutes. The win garnered Rain another title shot on November 6, 2010. However, Mercedes was once again successful, defeating Rain this time in an I Quit match. Rain's army would come to an end when Jessicka Havok turned on Rain and challenged her to a match which Havok won at WSU's 4 year anniversary show on March 5, 2011. From there, Rain would challenge for the WSU Spirit Championship at the Uncensored Rumble iPPV but came up short, losing to champion Sassy Stephanie. Rain would enter the Uncensored Rumble match but was eliminated by Amy Lee. Rain would turn to more of a fan-favorite after as she wrestled Serena Deeb at WSU's next event. Serena won the match but afterwards, they were both assaulted by tag team champions, the Boston Shore. Rain and Serena agreed to form a tag team to challenge for the titles but Serena ended up sidelined with a concussion leading Rain to call upon her longtime former tag team partner, Jetta, to reform the International Home Wrecking Crew. In September, Rain won the WSU Spirit Championship, her first title win in WSU, by defeating Sassy Stephanie. However, she would lose the championship later that very same night when she accepted an impromptu challenge from Jessicka Havok, who defeated her for the belt. On November 19, 2011 Rain and Jetta reformed the International Home Wrecking Crew but lost to the Boston Shore (Amber & Lexxus) in a tag titles match. Rain would later save Melina from a Boston Shore attack. At WSU's 5 Year Anniversary show on March 3, 2012, Rain was pinned by Lexxus, but bounced back with a win over Athena at the April 24th show of WSU. In which, Rain announced plans to put her career on the line in the Uncensored Rumble match on June 16, however she was forced to cancel due to an illness. WSU was then sold to new owners and Rain subsequently announced on July 14 that she could not come to a deal with the new owners and thus would not be returning to the promotion. Shine Wrestling (2012‚Äì2014; 2017‚Äìpresent) Rain made her debut for new women's wrestling promotion Shine Wrestling, stylized as SHINE, on July 20 in Ybor City, Florida where she defeated Nikki Roxx. At the next event on August 17, Rain continued her winning streak by defeating Santana Garrett. Rain competed in the main event of Shine 3 against Jazz on September 21 where she suffered her first defeat. At Shine 4 on October 19, Rain defeated Christina Von Eerie and later that night she would cost Jazz her match in the main event. That led to Shine 5 on November 16 where Rain teamed up with Mercedes Martinez in a losing effort against Jazz and Amazing Kong. During that match, Rain suffered a broken wrist. At Shine 6 on January 11, 2013, Rain did not compete due to injury but interfered in the main event, costing Amazing Kong her match against Mercedes Martinez. After the match, Rain formed her new group called The Valkyrie consisting of herself, Ivelisse Velez, Allysin Kay, Taylor Made, and April Hunter. On February 5, 2013, Rain officially announced that she would retire from wrestling at the end of the year. On February 22, Rain headlined Shine 7 with a DQ victory over Amazing Kong. At Shine 8 in March, Rain led the Valkyrie to victory in an eight-woman tag team match. Shine announced a tournament to crown its first champion and Rain defeated Angelina Love to advance to the tournament. On July 12, Rain first defeated LuFisto in the first round, then Jessicka Havok in the semifinals and finally Mia Yim in the finals to win the tournament and become the inaugural Shine Champion. On December 13, Rain successfully defended her title against Amazing Kong in what was billed as her retirement match. However, after the match, she announced that she was not retiring after all and would continue to defend the title in 2014. On January 24, Rain lost the Shine Championship to Valkyrie stablemate Ivelisse V√©lez, who was post-match kicked out of the stable. Following the loss, Rain officially retired from wrestling. On Shine 47, Rain returned to Shine.

In Adventist understanding, baptism (a public display of faith in Christ), is associated with officially joining the Adventist church, which is a part of the community of believers in Christ. The vow is explained in the church manual. (pages 32‚Äì35 approximately) In 2005 an alternate vow consisting of three statements was approved at the General Conference Session, and the baptizing pastor now has a choice of which set to use. They complement the 28 Fundamentals.  Baptismal vows  :1. Do you believe in God the Father, in His Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Spirit? :2. Do you believe and receive the death of Jesus Christ on Calvary as the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world, and believe that through faith in His shed blood we are saved from sin and its penalty? :3. Renouncing the world and its sinful ways, have you received Jesus Christ as your personal Saviour, and do you believe that God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven your sins and given you a new heart? :4. Do you accept by faith the righteousness of Christ, recognizing Him as your Intercessor in the heavenly sanctuary, and do you claim His promise to strengthen you by His indwelling Spirit, so that you may receive power to do His will? :5. Do you believe that the Bible is God's inspired word, and that it constitutes the only rule of faith and practice for the Christian? :6. Do you accept the Ten Commandments as still binding upon Christians; and is it your purpose, by the power of the indwelling Christ, to keep the law of God, including the fourth commandment, which calls us to keep the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath of the Lord? :7. Is the soon coming of Jesus the blessed hope in your heart, and are you determined to be personally ready to meet the Lord, and to do all in your power to witness to His loving salvation, and by life and word to help others to be ready for His glorious appearing? :8. Do you believe the Biblical teaching of spiritual gifts, and do you believe that the gift of prophecy is one of the identifying marks of the remnant church? :9. By God's grace do you purpose in your heart to biblically support the church by your tithes and offerings, your personal effort, and influence? :10. Do you believe that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and that you are to honor God by caring for your body, avoiding the use of that which is harmful? To abstain from all unclean foods, and from the use of all alcoholic beverages, tobacco, narcotics or any other type of drugs? :11. Knowing and understanding the fundamental Bible principles as taught in the Scriptures, is it your purpose, by the grace of God, to order your life in harmony with these principles? :12. Do you accept the New Testament teaching of baptism by immersion, and do you desire to be so baptized as a public expression of your faith in Christ and in the forgiveness of your sins? :13. Do you believe that the Seventh-day Adventist Church is the remnant church of Bible prophecy, Rev. 12:17, and that people of every nation, race, and language are invited and accepted into its fellowship? Do you desire to be a member of this local assembly of the world church?  Alternative vow  An alternative baptismal vow was introduced in 2005. It originated with the South Pacific Division branch of the Biblical Research Committee.Brown, Nathan, \\"SPD backs alternative baptismal vow \\". Record 110:33 (August 27, 2005), p3 It consists of the following three affirmations: :1. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and Lord, :2. Do you accept the teachings of the Bible as expressed in the Statement of Fundamental Beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and do you pledge by God‚Äôs grace to live your life in harmony with these teachings? :3. Do you desire to be baptized as a public expression of your belief in Jesus Christ, to be accepted into the fellowship of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and to support the church and its mission as a faithful steward by your personal influence, tithes and offerings, and a life of service? A caution was expressed by Dr. Brian Bull on theological grounds, where he states \\"who worried that placing the wording 'as expressed in the Statement of Fundamental Beliefs' led to the danger of the church turning the fundamentals into a creed.\\" Other delegates expressed concerns that the alternative vow is not detailed enough, but it was passed because of its optional nature. The choice of which vow to use is at the discretion of the pastor preparing the baptismal candidate.  History of baptismal confession in the Christian church  One of the earliest mention of a public confession is found in 1 Timothy 6:12. \\"Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.\\" The practice of baptismal confession finds its historical roots in the creeds of the Christian Church. The Apostles Creed provides an ancient example of such a creed. In an effort to show the value of various traditions, Tertullian describes the baptismal vow as practiced in his day: \\"When we are going to enter the water, but a little before, in the presence of the congregation and under the hand of the president, we solemnly profess that we disown the devil, and his pomp, and his angels.\\"De Corona, chapter 3. Accessed March 15, 2001 Public confession at baptism has been practiced throughout the history of the Christian Church. Infant baptism often included another person vowing for the infant to be faithful to Christ.  History of the baptismal vow in the Seventh-day Adventist Church  Adventists practice believers baptism rather than infant baptism. Believers at their baptism pledge or vow to follow Jesus. The pioneer Adventist leaders came from a variety of denominational traditions. Ellen G. White's had a Methodist background, while James White's was from the Christian Connexion. Prior to the establishment of the Seventh-day Adventist church, Millerite Adventists stated a vow at the time of their baptism.The Advent Herald, August 28, 1844, p. 6 Though the exact wording is not recorded, Seventh-day Adventists continued the Christian practice of the baptismal vow.In 1926, The Home and School journal at page 23 mentions the \\"examination for baptism to be conducted by the pastor.\\"In the June 8, 1876, edition of the Sign of the Times, James White wrote, \\"Those parents who brought their children to the (Camp) meeting and saw them converted, and take the baptismal vow, are now glad that they brought them.\\" As quoted in Ellen G. White, Volume 3 The Lonely Years 1876-1891, By Arthur L. White (1984)/Chap. 3 ‚Äì (1876) The Camp Meetings In the March, 1920 edition of The Church Officer's Gazette, R. A. Underwood presents eleven questions for the examining of persons to be baptized and received into the church.The Church Officers' Gazette, March, 1920, pp. 1, 2 His list, though numbering the same, is different than the 1941 list. Unlike that list, Underwood includes two questions regarding the Bible, a question on tithe, and one on the preservation of the body for service. His also has a question on the importance of a private prayer life. The first official actions regarding a Baptismal Vow in the Seventh-day Adventist Church took place in the early 1940s. At the Sixteenth meeting, June 5, 1941, of the General Conference Session, Oliver Montgomery moved that a committee be appointed to report to the next Autumn Council on the adoption of a uniform baptismal covenant for the world church. He said that there were many different lists of questions used and printed in different parts of the world. The motion was carried.General Conference Session Bulletin, June 10, 1941, p. 240. (Online p. 16.) The committee was appointed June 8 of the same year General Conference Committee Minutes, July 14, 1941, p. 35. (Online p. 16.) and reported to the Autumn Council, October 27, 1941.The General Conference Committee Minutes Autumn Council for 1941. October 27, p. 152 (online page 39) The Council adopted the report. This included a list of twenty-seven fundamental beliefs and eleven questions for the baptismal vow. The questions regarding spiritual gifts and the body temple were not included in this 1941 list. Vice-President of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, William Henry Branson, reported in February, 1942, Ministry magazine the church's reason for adopting a uniform baptismal vow. The church was growing. The work of Adventists had extended into all parts of the world. Adventist members came from about 800 language groups and workers needed guidance in presenting church doctrines to those in their language. Branson said that there was an alarming lack of uniformity in these matters. Ministers were establishing their own tests of fellowship. He writes that the tests applied by one are different from those applied by another. One person required incoming members to promise full participation in church missionary activities. Another would prepare a set of questions that deal with minute details of what the new members are to eat, drink, and wear. They set up entry requirements which the church had never set up. He said that, \\"many points of Bible instruction on Christian experience, missionary activity, support of Christian education, etc., are to be taught prospective candidates, but obviously many of these matters do not constitute tests of fellowship that are to be applied to those who request baptism and membership.\\" These matters should be taught persuasively but then left to each person's individual conscience. He stated that \\"not all that we as a people believe and teach has been incorporated into what is known among us as tests of fellowship, which tests must be satisfactorily passed by those who apply for membership in our church.\\" Oliver Montgomery, in the March, 1942, edition of Ministry, explained some of the committee's thinking. Similar to Branson's explanation, Montgomery distinguished between the many teachings valued by Seventh-day Adventist and those teachings which are considered tests of fellowship. Montgomery also explains why the many counsels of Ellen G. White, believed by Adventists to have the Biblical gift of prophecy, were not included in the Baptismal Vow. Montgomery states that \\"we have made no reference to the instruction given this people through the Spirit of prophecy in regard to many evils to be avoided and the right principles to be followed. On this point may I state that as a denomination, we hold to the fundamental Protestant principle of 'the Bible, and the Bible only\\" as our rule of faith and conduct. Every doctrine, every principle of faith, every truth of the gospel, every standard of righteousness, is found in the word of God. The Spirit of prophecy sheds wonderful light on the word of God. It magnifies the Word, and makes its meaning clearer and more beautiful. It is for our enlightenment and instruction. We recognize the divine source of this counsel and light. It is counsel from the Lord. It teaches, instructs, and admonishes. It clearly sets forth the right way, and the true principles, but does not legislate. It has never undertaken to establish baptismal requirements in the church. It is for the denomination to do this in its official capacity. Therefore, it seems clear that the personal or private interpretation of the teachings of the Spirit of prophecy should not be used or applied by an individual worker as a substitution for, or an addition to, accepted church standards as adopted by official action of the body.\\" Adherence to Church Standards.

History The first acquisitions for what was later to become the Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya were made in the mid-1940s by a Kathmandu schoolboy, Kamal Mani Dixit, with pennies that came from his lunch allowance. As the personal collection grew, it attracted gifts in kind from several important literary personalities, statesmen and scholars of Nepal and India. In 1956, the collection received an endowment from Chandra Shumsher JBR's daughter in law Rani Jagadamba Kumari Devi. Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya was officially registered in 1985, under Organizations Registration Act of 1977 of Nepal naming it after late Gen.Madan Shumsher JBR son of Chandra Shumsher JBR and husband of Jagadamba Kumari Devi. Kamal Mani Dixit, the founder of the library, is the chairman of the library.

Diamond- rich areas weren't discovered in Canada until the early 1990s. Before that time, diamonds were only known by Indigenous communities. For the first 60 years of the 20th century, diamonds originated from kimberlite pipes and alluvial deposits in places such as Africa and some from South America. Later, diamond discoveries were made in the Soviet Union (now Russia). Since the 1990s, major diamond discoveries were made and mining operations began. Canadian diamonds play a large role in the world market of diamonds. During the year 2017, Canadian mines produced 23 million carats of diamonds, valued at $2.6 billion. Russia, Botswana, Canada, Congo, D.R., and Australia produce over 80% of the world's diamonds. As of 2002, Canada is currently the seventh most important diamond producer by weight and fifth by value.  History of mining  The Northwest Territories (NWT) has had a long history with resource extraction, from the fur trade to the Klondike gold rush and mineral production. For the last 60 years, the Northwest Territories has turned from hunting land into large scale- resource extraction, such as diamond mining. It was not until 1991 that diamonds were officially discovered by non-indigenous people, specifically, by two geologists names Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson. This discovery lead to the first diamond mine in the NWT in 1998 called Ekati and initially operated by BHP Billiton. Later in 2003, Rio Tinto's Diavik Diamond Mine went into commercial production. Later, DeBeers opened the Snap Lake mine in 2008. (It closed in 2016.) Not only did the three mines makes large income, it created many jobs for the Indigenous, approximately 28% of Indigenous were employed by either mines. During the 19th century, approximately 200 small diamonds had been found across the United States, mostly in Brown and Morgan counties in Indiana. In January 1906, George F. Kunz speculated that these diamonds were glacial erratics that had been transported from an unknown site in Canada. Chuck Fipke and Stewart Blusson are credited with the discovery of the first diamond mines found in Canada in the mid 1990s. The first diamond rich area they discovered was in Point Lake, but it was quickly determined to be an uneconomical piece of land. Its find though, resulted in the largest diamond staking rushes in the history of mining. This massive search resulted in the discovery of the Ekati Diamond Mine which is home to 156 kimberlite pipes. Fipke and Blusson still share a 20% ownership of the mine, and since its discovery and start of operation in 1998, Ekati has produced over 40 million carats of diamonds. The discovery and later success of this diamond mine caught the attention of other major mining operations, and more massive mines were opened and fully operational within 10 years. Current mines Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine The Gahcho Kue Diamond Mine Project is a Canadian diamond mine located near Kennedy Lake, 280 km northeast of Yellowknife, on federal land. The mine is held by the Gahcho Kue Joint Venture (De Beers 51%, Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. 44.1% and Camphor Ventures 4.9%). Officially opened September 20, 2016, Gahcho is one of the richest diamond mines in Canada with a life expectancy of 12 years and a plan to produce over 50 million carats of diamonds. The mine contributes of three kimberlites called Tuzo, Hearne, and 5035, where all three are only accessible by helicopter or plane. The Tuzo kimberlite is the deepest part of the mine, abundant in Tuffisitic Kimberlie Breccia. The Hearne kimberlite is the transitional part of the mine, which also dominates in Tuffisitic Kimberlie Breccia. Lastly, the 5034 kimberlite is located directly under Kennady Lake, which was also the first kimberlite to be discovered at Gahcho and dominates in Hypabyssal Kimberlite. All three kimberlites have a life expectancy until 2028. Diavik Mine 237x237px The Diavik Diamond Mine is a diamond mine in Lac de Gras, Slave Craton, located about 300 km northeast of Yellowknife. Canada's second mine, first opened in January 2003, is of the largest open pit diamond mines in the world (according to production) and currently produces around 8 million carats annually. The mine is currently in a transitional shift from open pit mining to underground mining. The mine is a joint venture with Aber Resources Ltd., owning 60% And Kennecott Canada, owning 40%. Diavik Mine is can only accessible by aircraft or temporary ‚Äúice roads‚Äù during the winter season. Diavik Diamond Mine has four kimberlites on site, called A154 South, A154 North, A418 and A21, where all four kimberlites are located beneath shallow waters. Both A154 South and A154 North are mined by open pit methods which will develop into A418 and A21 kimberlites. BothA418 and A21 are mined underground. These kimberlites plan to have a mining life until 2025. Ekati Mine The Ekati Diamond Mine is Canada's first underground diamond operation, located in the Lac de Gras, around 300 km from Yellowknife. Exploration first started in 1981 but officially opened in October 1998. Since the opening until 2017, the mine produced around 67.8 million carats of diamond and is still in production. The mine is owned by Dominion Diamond Mines which first started with six kimberlites, called Beartooth, Fox, Koala, Koala North, Misery, and Panda. There are currently three underground kimberlites (Koala, Koala North, and Panda) and the rest are mined by surface mining. As of 2018, the current pipes which are mine are called Lynx, Pigeon, and Stable, all of which are open pit and Koala remains the only current underground mining. Ekati plans to mine in various pipes until 2042, however, there are ongoing exploration and projects associated with the closing date of the mine. Renard Mine Renard Diamond Mine is Quebecs first and only diamond mine fully owned by Stornoway, located approximately 250 km north of Chibougamau, Quebec. The mine was first opened in July 2014 and expects to produce around 1.6 million carats of diamond each year, with a mining life of 14 years, ending in 2028. There are currently nine pipes operating at Renard Mine with both open pit and underground mining. Renard Mine does not use chemical in extraction processes nor does is generate acid and metal leachates during processing, decreasing their impact during environmental assessment and reclamation project once mining operations are over. Snap Lake Mine Snap Lake Diamond Mine was Canada's first underground diamond mine, located approximately 220 km northeast of Yellowknife, NWT. The mine was owned by De Beers and was their first mine outside of Africa. The mine was only assessable by helicopter, plane and ‚Äúice roads‚Äù during the winter seasons. The mine first opened in 2008 and produced 1.2 million carats of diamonds. In 2015, De Beers announced closure of the mine due to the decrease in diamond pricing and water issues at the mine. Victor Mine Victor Diamond Mine is an open pit diamond mine located in the James Bay Lowlands, approximately 90 km west of Attawapiskat First Nation, Ontario. Victor Mine is Ontario's first diamond mine, which opened in July 2008, owned by De Beers. The mine has produced 7 million carats until its closure, announced early 2019. Environmental monitoring is expected to take around five years with a reclamation plan after the environmental monitoring phase. Jericho Mine Jericho Diamond mine is Located 420 km northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories and was Nunavut‚Äôs first and only diamond mine. The kimberlite was first discovered in 1994 but was not operated until 2006. Operated by Tahera Diamond Corporation, Jericho produced 780,000 carats but closed in 2008 due to bankruptcy. The mine is currently dormant and has yet to be purchased for further production of diamonds.  Star-Orion Mine  Star-Orion South Diamond Project is located approximately 60 km east of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The project was approved under the Environmental Assessment Act and is fully owned by Star diamond, starting bulk sampling in 2018. The mine plans to have road access all year, and estimates to produced 66 million carats diamonds during the project, which plans to last 38 years.  Environmental assessment  In Canada, there are currently two different systems which assess the impact of diamond mines. These systems are used as a framework to look at its sustainable development. The first approach is called the triple bottom line (TBL) approach. The TBL approach considers the environmental, economic, and societal impacts of diamond mining. This approach has the benefits of receiving legal attention, unlike the Five Capital (5 CAPS) approach. The 5 CAPS approach includes the natural financial and manufactured capital with humans‚Äô skills and social capital. One of the benefits of using the 5 CAPS approach is that it can be used to compare it to different countries sustainability.  Environmental impacts   Wildlife impacts  Barren ground caribou grazing in autumn. There are major concerns and threats to the wildlife associated with diamond mining. One of the most important mammals in the NWT are the Barren-ground caribou, which are heavily impacted during the construction phases of mining. Caribous play a central role in the cultural life of Indigenous culture and account for half of their meat intake. The process of clearing the land for extraction result in habitat fragmentation, disruption of wildlife corridors, contaminated drinking water, and collisions from vehicles. Due to the high death-rate of the caribous during mining practices, there are ongoing research going into their protection. Management of the caribous include groups such as co-management partners, Indigenous governments and organizations, renewable resource boards and communities. Another important mammal in the NWT are the grizzly bear. These bears are currently low in population and their reproduction rate is declining. Attention to the status of grizzly bears started in 1995, where reproach to their behaviour, habits, and lifestyle was studied. Bear habitat lost due to mining infrastructure is low but one of the main causes of grizzly death is the attraction of food waste from mines. Practices in reducing food waste and scrapes around the mine can help with the decline in their population.  Lake Health  One of the biggest threats to lake health occurs once mining operations are over. Many of the current mines in the NWT are located near lakes, which impacts its aquatic life, chemistry, and lake structure. The input of calcium (Ca) from diamond mining activities is an element that is found as a by-product of mining, which changes the chemistry of the lake, specifically its pH. Ekati Ming experiences a change in water chemistry where calcium concentrations increased from 1 mg/L to 30 mg/L. The increase in calcium results in an increase of pH from 7 to 8. Change in pH can restrict the plants and animals which are able to live in that environment. Post-mining activities cause the runoff of many toxic chemicals in near streams and rivers. Harsh chemicals found in aquatic lake environments can impact aquatic producers (phytoplankton) and primary consumers (zooplankton). The health of species found at the bottom of the food chain determine the health and population of species found at the top of the food chain. The process of the decline of larger species from producers is called bottom-up approach, where species at the bottom of the food chain determine the overall health of the lake. This cascading defect was seen at Ekati Diamond Mine, where lakes near the mine had a decrease in phytoplankton (producers) and zooplankton (primary consumers) where is caused the decrease of larger fish.

The song lasts for 11 minutes and 16 seconds. The song appears as the sixth song on the album, as a direct continuation of Vacant. The song gets its name from an early working title for the album Falling into Infinity, and the parallel between the concepts of \\"stream of consciousness\\" and \\"train of thought\\". The song \\"Lines in the Sand\\" (from Falling into Infinity) contains the lyrics \\"In the stream of consciousness, there is a river crying.\\" The song is a popular inclusion in Dream Theater's live shows and appears on the live album and DVD Live at Budokan. Songwriting contest While Dream Theater were in the studio in 2003, recording what would become Train of Thought, they wondered what an outsider would make of their descriptions for how certain sections of the unfinished songs sounded. These descriptions were used on arrangement charts to help with structuring the song before it was recorded. \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" had sections described as \\"Crimson Setup\\", \\"U.K. Rise\\", \\"Straight Groove x2\\", etc. They wondered what would happen if someone were given just these descriptions and had to come up with what they believed the finished song would sound like, so they issued a challenge to Dream Theater fans through their websites and message boards to do just that. Drummer Mike Portnoy posted photographs of the above-mentioned arrangement charts for \\"SOC\\" (the full title was not revealed to contestants, and may have been known only as \\"Suck Our Cocks\\"The writing of Train of Thought (timestamp 6:58)), as well as Jordan Rudess' MIDI conductor charts which contained tempos, time signatures and other details for each section of the song. The entries would be judged on songwriting excellence and closeness to the real \\"Stream of Consciousness\\", as judged by the band members themselves, and the prize for the winner included having their song played over the PA before Dream Theater concerts, four backstage passes to any Dream Theater show on that tour, a signed copy of the upcoming Train of Thought, and three releases from Portnoy's YtseJam Records. The contest began and after a number of months dozens of entries had been received. The band listened to and judged the entries over the course of the next world tour, and the winner was announced to be a composition by Andy Rowland and Ant Law. Impressed by the caliber of entries in the contest, Dream Theater released a CD of their favorite entries through the Dream Theater International Fan Club.

It is a client/server system that integrates PDF creation, job proofing, imposition, and a raster image processor (RIP) into one unified workflow.  History  Creo was the leading manufacturer of computer-to-plate technology in the 1990s, using thermal laser technology to capture a significant market share of the offset prepress industry. Because computer to plate technology allowed printers to image large numbers of plates at great speed, there arose a corresponding need to engineer a workflow that could process large amounts of data to feed the platemakers and ultimately the offset presses. Prinergy was code-named Araxi (a restaurant in Whistler, British Columbia) when it was conceived of in 1995, on a train trip returning from D√ºsseldorf after Drupa 1995. The Prinergy product name was chosen a few months before the product was launched. The name was created by namebase, based on a fusion of \\"Print\\" and \\"Energy.\\" In 1997 Creo and Heidelberg formed a joint venture to cooperate in the sales of computer to plate (CTP) systems. The software groups aligned to bring their previous workflow products together under a common development, and included components including color management and trapping derived from the DaVinci product line. The joint venture was dissolved in 2000. Prinergy 1.0 was introduced at Seybold in 1999.

Function  The Prinergy system was designed from the ground up to automatically perform all functions on the data that are necessary to take a digital file through a series of workflow steps to produce a master plate, any one of offset, gravure, or flexo. The pages for a job are first processed (normalized) with sanity checks to ensure it will not cause the RIP to fail at later stages. Then it is color-managed, meaning that the necessary color management and ICC profiles are attached to images and text. Then it is \\"trapped\\"; where colors join in a document, a slight overlap is created so that white space does not show on printing due to minute registration errors. After the Postscript or PDF is processed (refined) into the system, the operator has the option of a number of choices including sending single pages out to a proofer or impose the pages into a signature for platemaking. Virtually all Flexographic, offset and digital packaging, and offset commercial printers of the world (e.g. R.R.Donnelley, Quebecor, Mohn Media, Quad Graphics) use Prinergy as their central workflow management system, as well as thousands of smaller sheetfed offset printers. All job information and file metadata are stored in an Oracle database, while content is stored as Adobe PDF or PDF/X, and production control is stored as Adobe Portable Job Ticket Format, or Job Definition Format (JDF). Prinergy also has archival and retrieval capabilities.

Any user can speak at any time and be heard over the system immediately - there is no need to pick up a phone, press a button or perform any other separate activation function. Among other uses, it is popular with stock brokerage and other financial trading operations, as well as warehouse intercom applications. Users may have a speaker box which broadcasts live sound from remote locations, and such a system gives immediate access to other users in real time. Hoot-n-holler capability provides a tightly targeted method of communication that can support thousands of users worldwide and is a critical component of voice trading systems. Modern hoot-n-holler systems are frequently based on IP Multicast. Using IP means old analog dedicated circuits can be removed, eliminating their associated cost. Either way, the hoot system can be broadcast over traditional microphone and speaker box hardware, or through a trading turret or other office phone system. After the 1987 Stock Market Crash, regulatory authorities in the United States created a hoot-n- holler-based communication system known as INFOE to provide a continuous link between NASDAQ, security exchanges, and futures markets. This system allowed the various exchanges to instantly communicate current prices and other critical information during steep market declines.

Its area is . The size of the district, which also includes some unpopulated islands like Cotton Cay () nearby, is . The population is 186 (est. 2006), all in the district capital Balfour Town, established in 1673, on the west coast. Salt Cay is a tiny, flat, triangular island measuring about on a side and given over mostly to salt pans. It was once home to several hundred people, all supported by the salt industry. Salt Cay is accessible via plane; Caicos Express Airways flies there from both Providenciales and Grand Turk islands. From Grand Turk there is also a \\"community ferry\\", which operates three times a week and takes about one hour to cover the distance. History When the Spanish conquistador-explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n came to the Islands in 1512, they were still inhabited by Arawak Indians who disappeared afterwards due to the diseases contracted from the Europeans and forced labour imposed by them. Bermudians came to the islands in the 1673 century fleeing slavery and established what was to become the principal industry for the next 300 years ‚Äì the production of salt from brine. The islands came under British colonial rule in 1766. It was Turks and Caicos salt that George Washington needed to preserve the food for his army during the American Revolutionary War and that the Canadian and American fishing fleets used to salt down their catches. A combination of competition, costs, mismanagement and the lack of a deepwater harbor brought the salt industry in the Turks and Caicos Islands to an end. As late as the 1920s and 1930s, up to half a dozen sailing ships at a time would be anchored off Salt Cay awaiting cargo. The salt had to be ferried out to them over shallow water. Bahama Passage, a 1941 film, showed the salt industry in its final days. Ruins from the salt operations remain on Salt Cay. The island is now popular with tourists looking for uncrowded beaches and activities like whale-watching. Scuba diving and other water sports also attract visitors. Donkeys and cattle, descendants of those worked during the salt days, roam freely. On 7 September 2017, Hurricane Irma struck the Turks and Caicos, damaging 100% of the housing on Salt Cay. Facilities Three small restaurants specialising in fresh seafood exist on the island. The grocery options consist of three variety shops and three gift shops. Humpback whales of Salt Cay Humpback whale breaching off South Caicos The humpback whales of Salt Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands and Silver Bank are North Atlantic humpback whales, and are some of the same individuals one might encounter on a whale watching cruise off of Massachusetts' Stellwagan Bank, the coast of Maine, and further north into the waters of Iceland and Greenland, Newfoundland and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Salt Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands is in the middle of the humpback whales' annual migratory route to the Silver Banks, a humpback mating and nursery area, north of the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean Sea. It is a shallow coral reef area, an underwater plateau of limestone. It is believed that the whales choose this area for birthing and nursing because of the numerous coral heads which break the surface providing protection from ocean swells. Some estimates show 3,000‚Äì5,000 humpback whales passing through the waters of the Silver Banks between December and mid-April each year, making it the largest breeding and calving grounds, often called a nursery, in the world. Great Sand Cay, about south of Salt Cay, has been the ‚Äúemergency room‚Äù to many expecting humpback whales through the years. Humpback whales born in the waters around Great Sand Cay and their mothers, as well as other humpback whales, are often spotted both by passengers on boats and from the shores of Salt Cay.

KVGS airs a hot adult contemporary format branded as Star 107.9, airing a mix of 2000s' to 2010s' pop and rock hits. The station's studios are located in the unincorporated Clark County area of Spring Valley, while its transmitter is southwest of Lake Mead in Arizona. History The station is licensed to Meadview, Arizona with its transmitter just outside Dolan Springs, Arizona. The station has a full- power class C transmitter, and a 2,500-watt booster on The Stratosphere Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada to help fill in the signal in metro Las Vegas. Under former ownership of the locally based Desert Sky Media (which also owned KOAS, then a smooth jazz station), the station was \\"V-108\\", launched in 2002 at first as a Rhythmic Top 40 formatted station. Months later, due to a fierce competition with heritage KLUC and the newly launched KVEG, it shifted to an Urban Adult Contemporary format and carried the Tom Joyner Morning Show and the Michael Baisden show. It was moderately successful but it only lasted for three years. Riviera Broadcast Group acquired both KVGS and KOAS from Desert Sky, and flipped KVGS on October 21, 2005 to an alternative-based radio station (with a slight lean towards adult album alternative) as \\"Area 108\\" (\\"Area 107.9\\" as of October 2007).http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-10-28.pdf In September 2009, it re-branded again as 107.9 The Alternative. On October 20, 2011, at Midnight, soon after Beasley Broadcast Group bought the station and KOAS, KVGS ended its alternative rock format and flipped to Adult Hits as 107.9 Bob-FM. This returned the Adult Hits format to Las Vegas since KKJJ flipped from Jack FM to a simulcast of KXNT as KXNT-FM.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/53946/bob-happens-in-las-vegas/ The last song as \\"The Alternative\\" was Guerrilla Radio by Rage Against the Machine.

However, the signals being transmitted from this structure are relatively low-power and only cover the immediate Las Vegas area on a \\"fill-in\\" or \\"booster\\" basis.

Following this, the Gorizont system was integrated into the YeSSS Unified Satellite Communication System, and used to relay both civilian and military communications. From 1988 onwards, the satellites were also used in support of the Okean programme. Gorizont satellites are based on the KAUR-3 satellite bus, which provides three-axis stabilisation, and liquid manoeuvring engines. The series was replaced by the Ekspress series. Broadcast use Following the 1980 Olympics some of the surplus C Band capacity on the satellites was used to distribute Soviet Television both to relay transmitters within the USSR (where the vast physical size of the country made conventional distribution to remote areas difficult) and to other Eastern Bloc and allied countries for relay to Soviet troops stationed there. Later programming from other Warsaw Pact countries and Cuba were added.

It was written in the late 1970s and copyrighted in 1978. It traveled a complex and circuitous route to publication, before being officially released in 1984. It remains Acker's most popular and best-selling book. The novel is also considered a metafictional text, which is aware of its status as a fictional piece. The novel explores but simultaneously deconstructs the American politics of the time it was written and intercontinental history tying into the novel's subject of human trafficking, while being interspersed with sections of sexually detailed drawings, dream maps, symbolism and non-linear writing. Plot and narrative Blood and Guts in High School, while having a frequently disrupted and heavily surreal narrative, is the story of Janey Smith, a ten-year-old American girl living in M√©rida, Mexico, who departs to the US to live on her own. She has an incestuous sexual relationship with her father, whom she treats as \\"boyfriend, brother, sister, money, amusement, and father.\\" They live together in Mexico until another woman begins to interest Janey's father, leading Janey to realize he hates her because she limits him by dominating his life, and he wants to have his own life. Her father agrees to let her go and puts her into a school in New York City. For a period of time her father sends her money, but later she begins to work at a hippie bakery and is appalled by the customers, whose behavior gradually spirals out of control. She ends up having many sexual partners. She ends up pregnant twice and has two abortions; she seems to be furiously addicted to sex and does not care whom she sleeps with. In New York City she joins a gang, the Scorpions. One day, while the gang is driving frantically in a stolen car from the police, they are involved in a car crash: Janey is the only one who survives. Afterwards, she begins to live in the New York slums. Two thieves break into her apartment, kidnap her, and sell her into prostitution. She becomes the property of a Persian slave trader who keeps her locked up, trying to turn her out as a prostitute. We see Janey's dreams and visions, and read her journal entries and poems as the lines between reality and fiction begin to become blurred. Shortly before the kidnapper is to release her to become a prostitute for him, she discovers she has cancer. The slave trader lets her go and she illegally goes to Tangier, Morocco. There she meets Jean Genet, the iconic French writer, and they develop a relationship while Janey vulgarly and intensely discusses but later becomes attracted to President Jimmy Carter. Janey and Genet travel through North Africa and stop in Alexandria. Genet treats Janey badly and thinks little of her, but the worse he treats her the more she loves him. He decides to leave her. Janey gets arrested for stealing Genet's property, and shortly afterwards, by her luck, he joins her in prison. A rebellion breaks out as the narrative continues to deteriorate while particular figures, collectively named the Capitalists, meet to discuss how their society is collapsing. As it peaks, Janey and Genet are both thrown out of Alexandria. After travelling together across North Africa for some time, Genet gives Janey some money and leaves. However, soon after they part company, Janey dies suddenly, leaving time to pass endlessly as the narrative breaks into a final set of dream maps; here, the novel concludes. Storytelling technique In Blood and Guts in High School, Acker uses the technique of collage. She inserts letters, poems, drama scenes, dream visions and drawings. This creates a challenging text with a disturbed linearity. Acker freely admitted to using plagiarism in her work. The novel is considered an anti-narrative work since it jumps in and out of narration and contains different narrators. The narrative of the story is disrupted with pornographic drawings, letters, and dream maps to further disembody the plot but place the reader in the narrative itself. ‚ÄúAcker‚Äôs novel incorporates at least three main threads of poststructuralist discourse into Janey‚Äôs narrative. The first is an exploration biopower; the second is a reading of the oedipal family as pathology; and the third is an analysis of the gender politics of language‚Äù (Muth 90). Blood and Guts in High School incorporates the text from one of Acker's previous works, \\"Hello, I'm Erica Jong\\", a chapbook written passive- aggressively and vulgarly towards novelist and feminist satirist Erica Jong. Like the novel's heroine, Janey, Acker also died of breast cancer, twenty years after writing Blood and Guts. Many of Acker's heroines have or fear getting cancer. Critical reception Out of all of Acker's books, Blood and Guts in High School has received the most diverse criticisms and reviews. Many writers have tried analyzing Blood and Guts to understand exactly what Acker was trying to accomplish. Katie R. Muth in her article described Blood and Guts as a novel that draws arguments from gender studies, global capitalism, and theories of subject formation (89). Susan E. Hawkins describes Blood and Guts as a text that contains plagiarism, parody, pastiche, and other antirealist techniques that mark her work as postmodern (Hawkins 637). According to Hawkins, Acker is motivated by two discourses: the oedipal and the imperial (642). Using the mechanism of sexual and economic oppression, Acker is able to actualize the taboo surrounding incest by associating it with capitalism to demystify the oedipal formation of desire in the Western culture (Hawkins 646). Another critical review that Blood and Guts received is the narrative technique in the story. Not only is the narrating technique unstable and at times, unreliable, but the narrator herself, Janey, a 10-year-old girl, who lives until 14, experiences things that no little girl should. Kathy Hughes in her analysis takes a look at this approach by Acker and the overall effect of the novel when told from a 10-year-old perspective. Hughes argues that Acker attacks and flips the Freudian theory upside down through sarcasm and irony (Hughes 124). And a 10-year-old can accomplish what society is afraid of doing because of their simple matter of fact speaking, ‚ÄúJaney, as a child, does not have the socialization to throw the veil of intellectual language over the horrors of her daily life, thus Acker does not utilize poetics when describing her life‚Äù (Hughes 127). Blood and Guts was banned as being pornographic in West Germany and South Africa. It is featured in Peter Boxall's book, 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die and The Little Black Book of Books. Adaptations Laura Parnes created a \\"re-imagining\\" of the novel as a multi-screen video art piece in 2007.

He is therefore a grandson of Prince Devawongse Varopakarn, and a great-grandson of King Rama IV. (Mongkut). Reflecting his distant royal descent, Thai media refer to him as Mom Ui (; \\"Lord Ui\\"), using his nickname, \\"Ui\\". Pridiyathorn was educated at Saint Gabriel's College from year 1 to 12. During his childhood, Pridiyathorn rarely came second in school exams. He was nearly always first in his studies. He studied economics at Thammasat University, graduating with a bachelor's degree, and at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned an MBA in 1970.  Career  From 1971 to 1990 he worked for the Thai Farmers Bank, becoming senior executive vice president. In 1990 he became official spokesman for Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.

He is also a director of the Civil Service Commission and of the Thammasat University Council. Pridiyathorn repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who took office in 2001. Pridiyathorn disagreed with Thaksin's spending policy, which he saw as a cause of inflation. In 2004, the state-owned Krung Thai Bank (KTB) shocked Thailand's financial world by reclassifying approximately 40 billion baht as problem loans. Pridiyathorn threatened to fire KTB chief executive officer Viroj Nualkhair if he did not resign. Viroj was a former financial advisor to media proprietor Sondhi Limthongkul, having helped him make the initial public offering of one of his first companies.The Nation, \\"New party, old friends aid Sondhi\\", 11 April 2002 As Krung Thai Bank head, Viroj had forgiven 1.6 billion baht of Sondhi's debts and arranged for further rounds of forgiveness.

The plan to establish a new province had been proposed by the deposed government of Thaksin Shinawatra. \\"There are a lot of retention ponds in the area and water experts said they serve as waterways, allowing floods to flow to the sea.

Pridiyathorn asserted that the purchase was legal and refused to file charges, claiming that the FIDF was not a damaged party.

The site at 1-3 Chapel Street was first used for public entertainment in 1913 when Thomas Alford established the Diamond Theatre, which shared the site with a confectioner and livery stables. Part vaudeville theatre and part cinema, in 1914 it was renamed the Rex before closing in 1917. By 1924 the site had been occupied by a motor garage. History In 1935 Alford sold the property to Frank O'Collins. After council approval was received in October, demolition of the site's original buildings commenced in December. Construction began shortly afterwards, O'Collins having commissioned architect Ron Morton Taylor (among the earlier work of which included the State (now Forum) Theatre on Flinders Street) and construction firm Clements Langford. Work progressed rapidly and the new Astor Theatre was officially opened on 3 April 1936. The design of the theatre is in the Art Deco style typical of the time. Notably it was one of the last theatres in Melbourne to use the traditional two-level auditorium layout; the stall-and-circle arrangement falling out of favour for its cost during the post-war years. Originally it had a seating capacity of 1,673 people. The theatre has changed ownership several times, undergone redesign and survived redevelopment proposals to remain a Melbourne landmark venue. The Astor Theatre is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register, under record number H1751.Building details on the Heritage Victoria website It is also one of the rare contemporary theatres that consistently maintains the tradition of showing Double feature screenings for the price of single films. In 1983, The Astor Theatre was leased by George Florence, who still runs the business. Florence developed the programming style of The Astor, and the format of its quarterly calendar of forthcoming films. In August 2012, St Kilda businessman Ralph Taranto bought the Astor for an undisclosed sum believed to be less than the $3.8 million St Michael's paid for it at auction in 2007. He intended to leave the running of the cinema in the hands of Florence. When asked if his intention was to keep it as a single- screen cinema, Taranto's response was simple: Oh God yes. I wouldn't buy it otherwise. Whilst on 23 August 2014 it was announced that the Astor would close in early 2015 this changed when Palace Cinemas agreed to become the new tenant with apparent intent to 'continue business largely as it is', according to The Age. Palace announced that the cinema will reopen as is in June 2015 after some minor renovations to the candy bar.

The first satellite of this kind was launched on 13 October 1994. The satellites are produced by the company Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev (ISS Reshetnev).  Overview  The Ekspress series of communication satellites (industry code 11F639) was developed by the satellite company NPO PM as a replacement for the old Gorizont series of comsats. The first satellite of the series, Ekspress 1, was launched in 1994. It had a mass of 2500 kg, 17 channels and an operational lifetime of at 5‚Äì7 years. Starting in the mid-1990s, NPO PM started to make significant effort to close the technology gap between Russian and Western communication satellites. Cooperation with the French company Alcatel (now Thales Alenia Space) was begun in 1995. The first satellite of a new second series, Ekspress A-1, had 12 Alcatel-built transponders. It was lost in a rocket failure in 1999, but a replacement, Ekspress A-2 was successfully launched in March 2000. A major improvement was the Ekspress AM version, first launched in 2003. It has an operational lifetime of 12‚Äì15 years and is able to carry 38 channels, including digital TV, radio, broadband and internet. The launch of the Ekspress AM-3 spacecraft in June 2005 completed the modernization of Russia's communications satellite network. Other versions include the Ekspress 2000, which has a mass of 3200 kg. It has up to 60 transponders, power of 25 kW and a lifetime of 15 years. Satellites using this platform are called the Ekspress AT series and the Ekspress AM30 and AM40 series. Ekspress 1000 is smaller than the 2000 version; 700 kg to 1400 kg, 10 to 12 transponders, 2 kW of power and a lifetime of 15 years. Satellites based on Ekspress 1000 are called Ekspress AK or in its navigational version GLONASS-K. The developer NPO PM later changed its name to Information Satellite Systems Reshetnev (ISS Reshetnev). From 1999 to 2005, nine Ekspress-A and Ekspress-AM satellites were manufactured by the company. On 28 August 2008 Ekspress-AM1 switched to DVB-S2 broadcasting system and became the first DVB-S2 satellite in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. The Ekspress AM4 satellite was launched on 17 August 2011, but an anomaly with the Proton-M/Briz-M rocket left it in a useless orbit.Second Life for Failed Russian Satellite? (23 March 2012) The satellite was intentionally deorbited 26 March 2012, despite proposals to place the satellite into a higher-inclination orbit to provide coverage of the Antarctic. The Ekspress- MD2 satellite was lost in a similar failure in August 2012, when the Briz-M failed at the start of its third burn.

Desmoplakin is a critical component of desmosome structures in cardiac muscle and epidermal cells, which function to maintain the structural integrity at adjacent cell contacts. In cardiac muscle, desmoplakin is localized to intercalated discs which mechanically couple cardiac cells to function in a coordinated syncytial structure. Mutations in desmoplakin have been shown to play a role in dilated cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, striate palmoplantar keratoderma, Carvajal syndrome and paraneoplastic pemphigus. Structure Desmoplakin exists as two predominant isoforms; the first, known as \\"DPII\\", has molecular weight 260.0 kDa (2272 amino acids) and the second, known as \\"DPI\\", has molecular weight 332.0 kDa (2871 amino acids). These isoforms are identical except for the shorter rod domain in DPII. DPI is the predominant isoform expressed in cardiac muscle. The DSP gene is located on chromosome 6p24.3, containing 24 exons and spanning approximately 45 kDa of genomic DNA. Desmoplakin is a large desmosomal plaque protein that homodimerizes and adopts a dumbbell-shaped conformation. The N-terminal globular head domain of desmoplakin is composed of a series of alpha helical bundles, and is required for both the localization to the desmosome and interaction with the N-terminal region of plakophilin 1 and plakoglobin as well as desmocollin and desmoglein. This is further sub divided into a region called the \\"Plakin domain\\" made up of six spectrin repeat domains separated by SH3 domain. A crystal structure of part of the plakin domain has been resolved, while the entire plakin domain has been elucidated using small angle X-ray scattering which revealed a non-linear structure, an unexpected result considering spectrin repeats are observed in linear orientations. The C-terminal region of desmoplakin is composed of three plakin repeat domains, termed A, B and C, which are essential for coalignment and binding of intermediate filaments. Located at the most distal C-terminus of desmoplakin is a region rich in glycine‚Äìserine‚Äìarginine; it has been demonstrated that serine phosphorylation of this domain may modify desmoplakin-intermediate filament interactions. In the mid-region of desmoplakin, a coiled-coil rod domain is responsible for homodimerization.  Function  Desmosomes are intercellular junctions that tightly link adjacent cells. Desmoplakin is an obligate component of functional desmosomes that anchors intermediate filaments to desmosomal plaques. In cardiomyocytes, desmoplakin forms desmosomal plaques with the intermediate filament desmin, whereas in endothelial cells cytokeratin type intermediate filaments are recruited, and vimentin in arachnoid and follicular dendritic cell types. Both types of intermediate filaments attach in a lateral fashion to desmoplakin to form the plaque. In cardiac muscle, desmoplakin is localized to desmosomes in intercalated discs. Desmoplakin isoform DPI is highly expressed and is thought to play a role in both the assembly and stabilization of desmosomes; its role is critical, as desmoplakin knockout mice display embryonic lethality. In mice overexpressing a C-terminal mutated desmoplakin protein, desmoplakin binding to desmin is disrupted in cardiac muscle and hearts display abnormal intercalated disc formation and structure. Much has been learned regarding desmoplakin function from mutations in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, where mutations in specific binding domains alter desmoplakin binding to plakoglobin or desmin and result in cell death and dysfunction. Clinical significance Mutations in this gene are the cause of several cardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Mutations in DSP have also been associated with striate palmoplantar keratoderma. Carvajal syndrome results from an autosomal recessive mutation of a frameshift (7901delG) in DSP that results in a combination of above conditions, including dilated cardiomyopathy, keratoderma and woolly hair. Patients with Carvajal syndrome often suffer from heart failure in teenage years. A case of compound heterozygosity for two DSP nonsense mutations resulting in lethal acantholytic epidermolysis bullosa has been reported. Autoantibodies to DSP are a hallmark of the autoimmune disease paraneoplastic pemphigus. Decreased desmoplakin expression has been found in patients with oropharyngeal cancer and breast cancer, which may alter cell- cell adhesion properties and propagate metastasis.

Plakoglobin is a member of the catenin protein family and homologous to Œ≤-catenin. Plakoglobin is a cytoplasmic component of desmosomes and adherens junctions structures located within intercalated discs of cardiac muscle that function to anchor sarcomeres and join adjacent cells in cardiac muscle. Mutations in plakoglobin are associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Structure Human plakoglobin is 81.7 kDa in molecular weight and 745 amino acids long. The JUP gene contains 13 exons spanning 17 kb on chromosome 17q21. Plakoglobin is a member of the catenin family, since it contains a distinct repeating amino acid motif called the armadillo repeat. Plakoglobin is highly similar to Œ≤-catenin; both have 12 armadillo repeats as well as N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains of unknown structure. Plakoglobin was originally identified as a component of desmosomes, where it can bind to the cadherin family member desmoglein I. Plakoglobin also associates with classical cadherins such as E-cadherin; in that context, it was called gamma-catenin. Plakoglobin forms distinct complexes with cadherins and desmosomal cadherins.  Function  Plakoglobin is a major cytoplasmic component of both desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is the only known constituent common to submembranous plaques in both of these structures, which are located at the intercalated disc (ICD) of cardiomyocytes. Plakoglobin links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton. Plakoglobin binds to conserved regions of desmoglein and desmocollin at intracellular catenin-binding sites to assemble desmosomes. Plakoglobin is essential for normal development of intercalated discs and stability of cardiac muscle. Transgenic mice homozygous for a null mutation of the JUP gene die around embryonic day 12 from substantial defects in adherens junctions and a lack of functional desmosomes in the heart. Further studies showed that cardiac fibers obtained from JUP-null embryonic mice had decreased passive compliance albeit normal attachment of sarcomeres to adherens junctions. In additional studies, an inducible cardiac-specific plakoglobin knockout mice were generated. Transgenic mice displayed a similar phenotype as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy patients, with loss of cardiomyocytes, fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction, as well as alterations in desmosome protein content and gap junction remodeling. Hearts also exhibited increases in Œ≤-catenin signaling. Further investigations on the role of Œ≤-catenin and plakoglobin in the heart generated a double knockout of these two proteins. Mice exhibited cardiomyopathy, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities and sudden cardiac death, presumably via spontaneous lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Mice also showed a decrease in gap junction structures at intercalated discs. Intracellular plakoglobin expression s controlled by Wnt signaling and ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation. Phosphorylation of N-terminal Serines by a ‚Äúdestruction complex‚Äù composed of glycogen synthase kinase 3Œ≤ (GSK3Œ≤) and scaffold proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and axin targets plakoglobin for degradation.[31‚Äì33]. The phosphorylated motif is recognized by Œ≤-TrCP, a ubiquitin ligase that targets plakoglobin 26S proteasome-dependent degradation. Plakoglobin is also O-glycosylated near its N-terminal destruction box.  Clinical significance  Mutation of the JUP gene encoding plakoglobin has been implicated as one of the causes of the cardiomyopathy known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; mutations in JUP specifically causes an autosomal recessive form referred to as Naxos disease. This form of was first identified in a small cluster of families on the Greek island of Naxos. The phenotype of the Naxos disease variant of ARVD is unique in that it involves the hair and skin as well as the right ventricle. Affected individuals have kinky, wooly hair; there is also palmar and plantar erythema at birth that progresses to keratosis as the palms and soles of the feet are used in crawling and walking. These findings co- segregate 100% with the development of ARVD by early adolescence. It has become clear that ARVD/ARVC is a disease of the cardiac muscle desmosome; advances in molecular genetics have illuminated this notion. Studies investigating the role of plakoglobin in disease pathology have found that suppression of desmoplakin expression by siRNA led to the nuclear localization of plakoglobin, resulting in a reduction in Wnt signaling via Tcf/Lef1 and ensued pathogenesis of ARVC. Specifically, adipogenic factor expression was induced and cardiac progenitor cells at the epicardium were differentiated to adipocytes. Non-invasive cardiac screening identified T-wave inversion, abnormalities in right ventricular wall motion, and frequent ventricular extrasystoles as sensitive and specific markers of a JUP mutation. Additional studies have shown that immunohistochemical analysis of cardiac muscle desmosomal proteins is also a sensitive and specific diagnostic text for ARVD/ARVC. Abnormal distribution of plakoglobin due to mutations in genes encoding for Desmoglein 1 and 3 have also been implicated in Pemphigus vulgaris.  Interactions  Plakoglobin has been shown to interact with: * APC, * CTNNA1, * CTNNB1, * CDH1, * CDH2, * CDH3, * CDH5, * DSG2, * DSP, * MUC1, * PKP2, * PTPkappa (PTPRK), * PTPrho (PTPRT), and *PDLIM3.

The case report form is the tool used by the sponsor of the clinical trial to collect data from each participating patient. All data on each patient participating in a clinical trial are held and/or documented in the CRF, including adverse events. The sponsor of the clinical trial develops the CRF to collect the specific data they need in order to test their hypotheses or answer their research questions. The size of a CRF can range from a handwritten one-time 'snapshot' of a patient's physical condition to hundreds of pages of electronically captured data obtained over a period of weeks or months. (It can also include required check-up visits months after the patient's treatment has stopped.) The sponsor is responsible for designing a CRF that accurately represents the protocol of the clinical trial, as well as managing its production, monitoring the data collection and auditing the content of the filled-in CRFs. Case report forms contain data obtained during the patient's participation in the clinical trial. Before being sent to the sponsor, this data is usually de- identified (not traceable to the patient) by removing the patient's name, medical record number, etc., and giving the patient a unique study number. The supervising Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversees the release of any personally identifiable data to the sponsor. From the sponsor's point of view, the main logistic goal of a clinical trial is to obtain accurate CRFs. However, because of human and machine error, the data entered in CRFs is rarely completely accurate or entirely readable. To combat these errors monitors are usually hired by the sponsor to audit the CRF to make sure the CRF contains the correct data. When the study administrators or automated mechanisms process the CRFs that were sent to the sponsor by local researchers, they make a note of queries. Queries are non-sensible or questionable data that must be explained. Examples of data that would lead to a query: a male patient being on female birth control medication or having had an abortion, or a 15-year-old participant having had hip replacement surgery. Each query has to be resolved by the individual attention of a member of each local research team, as well as an individual in the study administration. To ensure quality control, these queries are usually addressed and resolved before the CRF data is included by the sponsor in the final clinical study report. Depending on variables relating to the nature of the study, (e.g., the health of the study population), the effectiveness of the study administrators in resolving these queries can significantly impact the cost of studies.  eCRF Originally all case report forms were made on paper.

(born 6 September 1982), commonly known as Carlitos, is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a left winger. In his country, he played mainly with Estoril, but also won one Primeira Liga championship with Benfica. He spent most of his career in Switzerland, with Sion and Basel. Club career Early years / Benfica Born in Lisbon, Carlitos started his professional career at Amora F.C. in 2001, at the age of 19. Two years later he moved to neighbours G.D. Estoril Praia, helping it achieve promotion to the Primeira Liga in his second year. Subsequently, Carlitos caught the eye of S.L. Benfica, who signed the player after the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Germany, where he appeared with Portugal. He helped Benfica conquer their first league title in 11 years, but could never break into the first team (ten games, nine as a reserve, none complete). Switzerland In January 2006, Carlitos was loaned out to Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, making a good impression in six months. In June, he returned to Benfica but was immediately loaned out again, this time to Swiss side FC Sion, teaming up with compatriot ‚Äì of Benfica and FC Porto fame ‚Äì Jo√£o Manuel Pinto. In July 2007, Carlitos was sold definitely but stayed in the country, moving to FC Basel for a fee of ‚Ç¨1.5 million. His official debut came on 22 July in a 1‚Äì0 win over FC Z√ºrich at St. Jakob-Park, and he scored the club's 200th goal in European competition on 5 December, curling the ball into the back of the net from a free kick against SK Brann, also at home, which also meant that Basel qualified for the UEFA Cup's round-of-32. Carlitos was a very important attacking element in Basel's double during his debut campaign. On 17 August 2008 he netted twice in a 4‚Äì1 win over the team's greatest rivals, Z√ºrich, at the Letzigrund. Hannover On 3 August 2010, Carlitos moved to Germany and its Bundesliga by signing with Hannover 96 for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut on the 21st, retiring injured after three minutes in an eventual 2‚Äì1 home win against Eintracht Frankfurt; after being diagnosed with a tore cruciate ligament, he featured rarely until the end of his contract. Later career Carlitos returned to Portugal and its top division on 31 August 2012, re-joining former club Estoril. He scored his first goal for them in the competition on 9 February 2013 to close a 2‚Äì0 home victory over Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es, adding six matches and one goal in the 2013‚Äì14 UEFA Europa League. In the summer of 2014, Carlitos returned to Sion on a two-year deal.

His analyses on the declining leadership of the \\"new\\" (post-1968) middle classes on the French political system explain the 2007 success of Nicolas Sarkozy. He develops a comparative theory of Welfare regime sustainability based on the age-period- cohort impact of economic stresses on social generations: Southern European countries, including France, prefer the development of seniority rights to the integration of the new generations. A \\"policy of generation\\" would be able to restore the long-term balance between age groups. He has published seventy scientific papers on social change, social inequalities, middle class, generational change and suicide, he is also a proponent of public sociology. Member of the Institut universitaire de France, he is also member of the executive committee of the French Association Fran√ßaise de Sociologie and of the International Sociological Association, and had been the General Secretary of the European Sociological Association (2004‚Äì2006).

It is an active process, the hormone is transported in cell-to-cell manner and one of the main features of the transport is its asymmetry and directionality (polarity). The polar auxin transport functions to coordinate plant development; the following spatial auxin distribution underpins most of plant growth responses to its environment and plant growth and developmental changes in general. In other words, the flow and relative concentrations of auxin informs each plant cell where it is located and therefore what it should do or become. Chemiosmotic model Polar auxin transport (PAT) is directional and active flow of auxin molecules through the plant tissues. The flow of auxin molecules through the neighboring cells is driven by carriers (type of membrane transport protein) in the cell-to-cell fashion (from one cell to other cell and then to the next one) and the direction of the flow is determined by the localization of the carriers on the plasma membrane in the concerned cells. The transport from cell to the neighboring one is achieved through relatively complex combination of several sub-processes. To explain the mechanism behind unique character of auxin transport through living cell files of the plant, the so-called chemiosmotic model was formulated. The mechanism was first proposed in the seventies by Ruberry and Sheldrake and this visionary prediction was finally proven in the 21st century. The mechanism below describes the process in which auxin is trapped in the cell by the so-called acid trap and how it can then leave the cell only by activity of specific carriers, which control the directionality of the flow from cells and generally the direction of auxin transport through the whole plant body. Acid trap Passive diffusion on a cell membrane. However; in a case of auxins, only the non-dissociated portion of auxin molecules is able to cross the membrane As weak acids, the protonation state of auxins is dictated by the pH of the environment; a strongly acidic environment inhibits the forward reaction (dissociation), whereas an alkaline environment strongly favors it (see Henderson-Hasselbalch equation): The export of auxins from cells is termed auxin efflux and the entry of auxin in to cells is called auxin influx. The first step in polar transport is auxin influx. Auxin enters plant cells by two methods, first by passive diffusion as non-ionized IAA molecule or the protonated form as IAAH across the phospholipid bilayer, or second by active co-transport in the anionic form IAA‚àí. As IAAH is lipophilic, it can easily cross the lipid bilayer. ::\`IAAH\` \`IAA‚àí + H+\`, where \`IAAH\` = indole-3-acetic acid; \`IAA‚àí\` = its conjugate base The inside of cells (pH ~ 7) is less acidic than the outside (the apoplast; pH ~ 5.5). So outside the cell a significant portion (17%) of the IAA molecules remain un-dissociated (proton-associated). This portion of auxin molecules is charge-neutral and therefore it is able to diffuse through the lipophilic lipid bilayer (lipid bilayer being constituent of cell membrane) into the cells. Once through the bilayer in the cell, the molecules are exposed to the more basic pH of the cell interior, and there they dissociate almost completely, producing anionic IAA‚àí. These chemically polar ions are unable to passively diffuse across the cell membrane and remain trapped inside the cell.  Polarity of auxin export Once inside the cell, auxin cannot leave the cell on its own by crossing the lipid bilayer. Hence the export of auxin from the cell requires an active transport component in the plasma membrane - i.e. some membrane transport protein. Two protein families: The PIN proteins and ABCB (PGP proteins) transporters function as \\"auxin efflux carriers\\" and transport the anionic form of auxin out of the cell. While the PGP auxin efflux carriers are evenly distributed, the PIN proteins normally maintain polar (i.e. asymmetric) localisation on the plasma membrane. That is to say they are most concentrated on one side of the cell. Furthermore, the asymmetrical localisation of the PIN proteins is coordinated between neighbouring cells. As a result, the PIN proteins generate a directional flow of auxin at the tissue and organ scale. This PIN-generated flow is called auxin polar transport. For example, the cells located in the vasculature (at the center) of the root all show PIN1 proteins on their basal membrane only (i.e. on their lower side). As a result, in the root vasculature, auxin is transported directionally from the shoot to the root tip (i.e. downwards).  Role in plant development   Self-organisation of polar auxin transport  :See also \\"Uneven distribution of auxin\\" and \\"Organization of the plant\\" in the main Auxin article Auxin plays a central role in PIN protein polarity establishment. The regulation of PIN localisation by auxin creates a feedback loop where PIN proteins control the directionality of auxin fluxes, and auxin in turn controls PIN proteins localisation. These interactions between auxin and its own transporters confer to the system self- organizing properties, which explains for instance phyllotaxis (the regular and geometrical arrangements of lateral organ along the stem), the formation of leaf serrations, and the formation of vascular strands. This positive feedback regulation auxin on its own transport also plays an essential role in vascular development, which process is called canalization. PIN proteins are so named because mutant plants lacking the founding member of this family, PIN1, cannot develop flowers. The formation of flowers is triggered by regularly spaced local auxin accumulation at the surface of the shoot apical meristem and, for this PIN1 is required. As a result, the pin1 mutant plants produce a \\"pin-like\\" inflorescence consisting only of a naked stem. This highlights the importance of polar auxin transport in plant development.  Tropisms  Other external and internal signals (e.g. blue light, mechanical stress, gravity or cytokinins) can interfere with PIN protein polarity and therefore with the directionality of auxin polar transport. Because auxin controls cell division and cell elongation, the change of PIN proteins localisation, and the subsequent change in auxin distribution, often lead to a change in the growth pattern. For instance, the regulation of polar auxin transport is central in a process such as gravitropism. This process, which ensures that the root grows downwards, relies on the redistribution of auxin by the columella cells (the cells located at the very tip of the root). These cells respond to gravity by special organelles, the statoliths, that redistribute auxin from the vasculature to the root epidermis and the lateral root cap. These tissues (which form the external cell layers of the root) transport auxin back to the elongation zone where it regulates cell elongation. When the gravitational gradient is not aligned with the axis of the columella cells (because the root is not vertical), the PIN proteins move to the side of the cell membrane that is gravitationally lowest. This causes more auxin to flow to the lower side of the root. Once in the elongation zone, the extra auxin inhibits cell elongation and cause the root to re-orient downwards. Similar mechanisms occur in other tropic responses, such as phototropism. The mechanisms were first described by the Cholodny-Went model, proposed in the 1920s by N. Cholodny and Frits Warmolt Went.  Generation of morphogenetic gradients  Polar auxin transport is required for the generation of auxin gradients throughout the plant body. Those gradients have development significances akin to the gradients of morphogens in animal bodies. They are necessary for development, growth and response of any plant organ (such as cotyledons, leaves, roots, flowers or fruits) and response of plant to environmental stimuli known as tropisms.  Regulation  Although the detailed molecular mechanism of PIN proteins polarity establishment remains to be elucidated, many endogenous and exogenous regulators of PIN proteins localisation have been characterised.  Auxin  Most importantly, PIN proteins localisation on the plasma membrane is controlled by auxin. Several mathematical models making different assumptions on the way auxin influences PIN localisation explain different observations. Some models assume PIN proteins polarize towards the neighbouring cell containing the highest cytosolic auxin concentration. These models are called \\"up-the-gradient\\" models and explain for instance phyllotaxis. Other models assume that PIN proteins localise on the side of the cell where the efflux of auxin is the highest. These models are called \\"with-the-flux\\" models and explain the formation of vascular strands in leaves. The molecular mechanism responsible for these different behaviours of the system (with-the-flux and up-the- gradient) is not yet fully understood. Noticeably, an auxin receptor protein called ABP1 is thought to play a potentially significant role in the control of PIN proteins polarity by auxin.  Mechanical stress  Mechanical signals have been proposed to regulate PIN polarity.  Vesicle Trafficking  The asymmetrical localisation of PIN efflux carrier protein at the plasma membrane has been shown to involve the localized targeting of vesicles and the local regulation of endocytosis. The latter involves the actin cytoskeleton.  Inhibitors of the transport  In research, 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) are used as specific inhibitors of the auxin efflux. Quercetin (a flavonol) and Genistein are naturally-occurring auxin transport inhibitors.p.435 Plant Physiology Third Edition Taiz and Zeiger (2002) 9-Hydroxyfluorene-9-carboxylic acid (HFCA), TIBA, and trans- cinnamic acid (TCA) are also example of Polar Auxin Transport Inhibitors. They prevent the development of the bilateral growth of the plant embryo during the globular stage. All 3 inhibitors induce the formation of fused cotyledons in globular but not heart-shaped embryo.  Phosphorylation  Polar auxin transport can be regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation; protein kinases and protein phosphatases mediate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. A study suggests that phosphatase inhibition can alter the activities of acropetal and basipetal auxin transport. With decades of studies, multiple kinases have been reported to phosphorylate PIN proteins, including PINOID, D6PK, PAX, MPK6 and CRK5; and phosphorylated PIN proteins can be oppositely dephosphorylated by Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A), Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP6. The AGC family of kinases play essential roles in catalyzing PIN phosphorylation and in regulating PIN function. 3'-Phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), also from the AGC family, is a critical activator of AGC kinases and is thus also involved in the regulation of PIN-mediated auxin transport. Gloria K Muday, Alison DeLong. (2001)Polar auxin transport:controlling where and how much. Trends in Plant Science 6(11):535-542. PINOID and D6PK share at least three phosphosites (P-sites) at the cytoplasmic loop (also called hydrophilic loop) of long PIN proteins, but their functions are not all the same. both of the two kinases can increase PIN activity via phosphorylation. However, PINOID (non- polar)-mediated phosphorylation also determines the apicobasal polar targeting of PIN proteins, i.e., more phosphorylation, more apical. D6PK and its homologs localize at the basal side of plasma membrane, modulating the rootward auxin fluxes and subsequent developmental processes.

(1) pindo; (2) mji; (3) jina. The jina of this kanga is Bahati ni upepo sasa upo kwangu, which can be translated as \\"Luck is like the (blowing of the) wind, now it is on my side\\" The kanga, is a colourful fabric similar to kitenge, but lighter, worn by women and occasionally by men throughout the African Great Lakes region. It is a piece of printed cotton fabric, about 1.5 m by 1 m, often with a border along all four sides (called pindo in Swahili), and a central part (mji) which differs in design from the borders. They are sold in pairs, which can then be cut and hemmed to be used as a set. Whereas kitenge is a more formal fabric used for nice clothing, the kanga is much more than a clothing piece, it can be used as a skirt, head-wrap, apron, pot- holder, towel, and much more. The kanga is culturally significant on Eastern coast of Africa, often given as a gift for birthdays or other special occasions. They are also given to mourning families in Tanzania after the loss of a family member as part of a michengo (or collection) into which many community members put a bit of money to support the family in their grief. Kangas are also similar to Kishutu and Kikoy which are traditionally worn by men. The Kishutu is one of the earliest known designs, probably named after a town in Tanzania, they are particular given to young brides as part of their dowry or by healers to cast off evil spirits. Due to its ritual function they do not always include a proverb. The earliest pattern of the kanga was patterned with small dots or speckles, which look like the plumage of the guinea hen, also called \\"kanga\\" in Swahili. This is where the name comes from, contrary to the belief that it comes from a Swahili verb for to close. Origins A woman wearing kanga in Siyu on Pate Island, Kenya. Kangas have been a traditional type of dress amongst women in East Africa since the 19th century.  Merikani  According to some sources, it was developed from a type of unbleached cotton cloth imported from the US. The cloth was known as merikani in Zanzibar, a Swahili noun derived from the adjective American (indicative of the place it originated). Male slaves wrapped it around their waist and female slaves wrapped it under their armpits. To make the cloth more feminine, slave women occasionally dyed them black or dark blue, using locally obtained indigo. This dyed merikani was referred to as kaniki. People despised kaniki due to its association with slavery. Ex-slave women seeking to become part of the Swahili society began to decorate their merikani clothes. They did this using one of three techniques; a form of resist dying, a form of block printing or hand painting. After slavery was abolished in 1897, Kangas began to be used for self-empowerment and to indicate that the wearer had personal wealth.  Len√ßos  According to other sources, the origin is in the kerchief squares called lencos brought by Portuguese traders from India and Arabia. Stylish ladies in Zanzibar and Mombasa, started to use them stitching together six kerchiefs in a 3X2 pattern to create one large rectangular wrap. Soon they became popular in the whole coastal region, later expanding inland to the Great Lakes region. They are still known as lesos or lessos in some localities, after the Portuguese word.  Manufacture  Until the mid- twentieth century, they were mostly designed and printed in India, the Far East and Europe. Since the 1950s kangas started to be printed also in the city of Morogoro in Tanzania (MeTL Group Textile Company) and Kenya (Rivatex and Thika Cloth Mills Ltd are some of the largest manufacturers in Kenya) and other countries on the African continent.  Proverbs  In the early 1900s, proverbs, sayings, aphorisms and slogans were added to kangas. A trader in Mombasa, Kaderdina Hajee Essak, also known as \\"Abdulla\\", began to distinguish his kangas with the mark \\"K.H.E. - Mali ya Abdulla\\", to which he often added a proverb in Swahili. Initially they were printed in Arabic script, and later in Roman letters. Towards the eastern part of the region, phrases in Kiswahili are traditional, while in central areas phrases in both Kiswahili and Lingala are popular.  Appearance  * Generally Kangas are 150 cm wide by 110 cm long. * They are rectangular and always have a border along all four sides. * Often kangas have a central symbol. * Most modern kangas bear a saying, usually in Kiswahili. There are many different ways to wear kangas. One traditional way of wearing the kanga is to wrap one piece as a shawl, to cover the head and shoulders, and another piece wrapped around the waist. Kangas are also used as baby carriers. Communication vehicle Paje, Zanzibar, Tanzania Typically, kangas consist of three parts: The pindo (wide border), the mji (central motif), Ujumbe or jina (the Kiswahili) is featured on a strip which contains a message. It is less commonly written in Arabic or Comorian. Other countries which produce their own Kangas write the Kanga messages/names in their main languages: in Madagascar (Malagasy Republic) where they are known as lambas, they feature ohabolana, traditional proverbs written in Malagasy; they are also produced in Zambia and Malawi. This message is called the jina (literally 'name') of the kanga. Messages are often in the form of riddles or proverbs. When giving a kanga as a gift, one must be mindful of the proverb, as they can be somewhat insulting. Occasionally, one of these is given as a gift at a wedding to express a person's opinion that the couple shouldn't be married! However, most of the messages express kind sentiments and good wishes. Some examples of proverbs: *Majivuno hayafai: There is no value in showing off *Mkipendana mambo huwa sawa: Everything is all right if you love each other *Japo sipati tamaa sikati: Even though I have nothing, I have not given up my desire to get what I want *Wazazi ni dhahabu kuwatunza ni thawabu: Parents are gold; to take care of them is a blessing *Sisi sote abiria dereva ni Mungu: We are all passengers, God is the driver *Fimbo La Mnyonge Halina Nguvu: The feeble punishers blow, is weak. *Mwanamke mazingira tunataka, usawa, amani, maendelo: We (women) want equality, peace, and progress *Naogopa simba na meno yake siogopi mtu kwa maneno yake: I‚Äôm afraid of a lion with its strong teeth but not a man with his words(lyrics). *Leo ni siku ya shangwe na vigelegele: Today is a day for celebrations and ululations.

Family and early career He was involved in the negotiations that led to the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk with Russia, placing the Georgian kingdom under the protection of Tsarina Catherine II. In 1784, Prince Chavchavadze was appointed as an ambassador to St Petersburg. He was welcomed in Russia, and Empress Catherine became a godmother at the baptism of his Petersburg-born son, Alexander, the future poet and general. During his tenure as ambassador, Garsevan urged the Russian government to timely fulfill the promise of protection, but Georgia was left without any assistance when, in 1795, Persia attacked and devastated the country after Erekle's refusal to terminate his ties with Russia.Lang, DM (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, p. 38Cornell, SE (2001) Small Nations and Great Powers: A Study of Ethnopolitical Conflict in the Caucasus, Routledge (UK), , p. 145 Although many leading Georgian politicians became disillusioned in Russia, Chavchavadze still seconded the alliance with Russia, to which Georgia was bound by common faith, and supported George XII‚Äôs renewed quest for the Russian protection in 1799.

Back in Georgia, he fruitlessly attempted to lobby for the preservation of a degree of internal autonomy for his native country. He remained in opposition to the Russian rule throughout the following years, prompting the new administration of Georgia to deport him to Russia in 1805. Not allowed to return to his homeland, Chavchavadze settled in St. Petersburg. He died there in 1811, and was buried at Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

On February 15, 2000, the Middle District Court of Florida (Orlando) sentenced Weiss, to 845 years (later reduced to 835 years) in prison for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, restitution of $125,016,656, and a fine of $123,399,910, in connection with the collapse of National Heritage Life Insurance Company (NHLC).United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF-KRS. Judgment Doc. 1372. His involvement did not result in any losses to the insurance company or the stakeholders in the company's policies. Weiss fled the country at the end of his trial and was a fugitive for one year, and was subsequently extradited from Austria. Weiss' sentence is the longest given to a white-collar criminal in the United States. It is also the longest sentence given for a victimless crime. Early life and background The son of Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivors, Weiss did construction work as a young man, and established Windsor Plumbing Supply in 1974, eventually making $20 million a year. After Windsor Plumbing declared bankruptcy in 1989, Weiss became a bankruptcy specialist. Through that business he met New York attorney Michael D. Blutrich, who was \\"outside counsel\\" to National Heritage Life Insurance Company, and his partner Lyle K. Pfeffer, also connected to National Heritage, through whom he became involved with National Heritage. Weiss was indicted on mail fraud charges and found guilty, for which he served eight months in prison. He is an observant Hasidic Jew and has acted as a rabbi to other Jewish inmates while incarcerated. Allegations and conviction In late 1989, National Heritage reported an operating loss and 27% reduction of capital from a decline of sales, and in 1990 insurance regulators threatened to shut down the company if it did not raise additional capital. A group of investors, offered $4 million to satisfy regulators, in exchange for a controlling interest in National Heritage. The group provided a $4 million check, but once in control of National Heritage, transferred $3 million from National Heritage to help cover the check. This began a long series of schemes in which millions were stolen from National Heritage by the group of investors. Bad investments further depleted National Heritage capital creating a $35 million dollar hole plus an additional $10 million for the company. In the early 1993, the group decided to cover up all the missing money by a \\"mortgage-backed bond scheme\\". Weiss was contracted by the investment group to purchase discounted mortgages with National Heritage funds, which were put into a mortgage-backed bond. Weiss and NHLC agreed that Weiss through his company South Star would place NHLC money into viable secured investments, which needed to be backed by real property, and be for the benefit of the insurance company. Weiss received approximately $100 million of NHLC funds and bought $177 million face-valued mortgages. They were mostly non-performing but was bought at a deep discount of roughly for $87 million. The mortgages were mostly FDIC-insured and secured by real property. It was believed that the discounted mortgages could be rehabilitated, and thus make a large profit for NHLC. But once the mortgages were purchased and placed in a bond, the managers of NHLC fraudulently placed the bond on National Heritage's books with inflated values to conceal the missing money that was mismanaged or looted by the company's managers. Weiss and other business executives and lawyers working for NHLC either pleaded guilty or were convicted in the fraud case. Some of the executives who were the originators of the crime either received immunity or pleaded guilty with a plea deal for their testimony, admitted to forging documents and lying to regulators. In exchange for their testimony against co-defendants like Weiss, the prosecutors would drop their criminal counts and recommend a reduction of their sentence. Weiss claims that if he were re-sentenced today under current sentencing guidelines, without losses attributed to him, he would receive a sentence of no more than 37 months.United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF-KRS. Doc. 2454 Additionally, Weiss claims that the satisfaction of restitution was satisfied with the proceeds of the mortgages that he bought for the benefit of NHLC at a substantial discount from its face value (53% discount). The receivers settled these mortgages and collected the full face value, realizing a large profit for the insurance company. Sentencing The rules of the sentencing guideline (¬ß2B1.1, Application Notes: (D) Exclusions from Loss and (E) Credits Against Loss (iii), \\"In a case involving collateral pledged or otherwise provided by the defendant, the amount the victim has recovered at the time of sentencing from disposition of the collateral, or if the collateral has not been disposed of by that time, the fair market value of the collateral at the time of sentencing\\"). While at sentencing, the receivers claimed they had collected only $65 million, however no credit was given.Sholam Weiss PSR, 74, \\"some of the assets (valued approximately $65 Million) purchased with these fund were recovered\\". Three weeks after sentencing the receivers had collected a total of $175-$200 million, yielding a profit of $50-$100 million. It took the government 16 years to file a satisfaction of restitution. At Weiss's sentencing on the National Heritage charges in February 2000, Judge Patricia C. Fawsett sentenced Weiss to 845 years in prison, with a fine of $123.4 million and ordered $125 million in restitution (which is jointly and severally with other co-defendant, and has fully been paid.Notice to the court, filed by the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida, to the Middle District Court of Florida. United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF-KRS. Doc. 2446.) Weiss is currently serving his sentence at the medium security prison, FCI Otisville, in Otisville, New York. His projected release date is June 10, 2738. Extradition Weiss surrendered to Austrian authorities in the fall of 2000, and was extradited back to the United States in 2002. The extradition was challenged at the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and the European Court of Human Rights, both of which noted that the United States provided assurances that Weiss would receive a full appeal and a full re- sentencing.Sholam Weiss v. Austria, Communication No. 1086/2002, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/77/D/1086/2002 (2002) The extradition was also raised in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, also noting the U.S. assurances.Parliamentary Assembly, Extradition of Sholam Weiss, Written Question No. 415 by Lord Russell-Johnston (Doc. 9578) April 1, 2003. According to a 2017 letter from Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern to US President Donald Trump, under Austrian law, Weiss would have received no more than a 10-year sentence, and Austria granted extradition on assurances from the United States that Weiss would receive a full appeal and full re-sentencing. Austria has requested Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump for a commutation of sentence to time served. Weiss challenged his incarceration in federal court, arguing that the United States violated its extradition treaty with Austria by not providing a full re-sentencing and a full appeal (denied under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine), which United States assured Austria to effectuate the extradition.United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF- KRS. Doc. 168 In 2009, a judge restored his right of appeal to satisfy the treaty obligation, and took ten years off his sentence.United States v. Weiss, Case No. 6:98-cr-99-PCF-KRS. Doc. 189 Weiss argued that the United States was also required to provide a full re-sentencing, but was denied for procedural reasons, with the court commenting that it was up to the Executive branch to satisfy the international obligation by a commutation of sentence.United States v.

It contains more caffeine than rival energy drinks Red Bull and Rockstar, symbolized by three and a half steer heads on the label. Aside from caffeine, the label claims 750 milligrams of taurine, another common ingredient found in many energy drinks. History Cocaine was created by Jamey Kirby, who used to work as a software executive. Originally, the drink was going to be named \\"Reboot\\", but the name was already taken. Instead, the name \\"Cocaine\\" was chosen for its potential to be controversial. Kirby founded Redux Beverages in 2006 with his wife Hannah, and launched Cocaine in autumn of that year. According to Jamey Kirby, initial marketing costs merely consisted of sending a case of energy drinks to the New York Post offices. While the drink contained no actual cocaine, the product launch attracted criticism from lawmakers and anti-drug organizations, who felt that Cocaine glamorized drug usage to children. That same month, 7-Eleven publicly asked its franchisees to stop selling the energy drink. According to the Las Vegas Sun, Kirby made over $1.5 million in sales three months after Cocaine's debut. In 2007, Cocaine was temporarily pulled from shelves in the United States, after the Food and Drug Administration published a warning letter stating that Cocaine \\"was illegally marketing the drink as both a street drug alternative and a dietary supplement\\".https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2007/ucm076349.htm The FDA cited statements made on Cocaine's packaging and website as evidence for their claims. In response, Redux Beverages removed the statements from their website, and began working on a new name for the product immediately. At the end of May, 2007, the Redux team decided to change the name to No Name. On 17 June 2007, the drink was redistributed in the U.S. under the new labeling. The Las Vegas Sun reported that online sales of Cocaine had quadrupled two weeks after the FDA's warning letter. Beginning in February 2008, the old Cocaine name was used again. In addition to the FDA, Cocaine also faced trouble from specific U.S. states that same year. In April 2007, hundreds of cases of Cocaine were seized by the Department of Consumer Protection in Connecticut, which stated that the company had not registered with them, and that drink's labels did not comply with state laws requiring companies to label their drink's water source. That year, attorney generals in Connecticut and Illinois announced that Redux Beverages complied to not market Cocaine in their respective states. In May 2007, the Texas Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Redux Beverages, stating that the drink was being marketed as a legal substitute to actual cocaine. In 2011, The Coca-Cola Company filed an opposition to Redux Beverages' trademark of Cocaine in Chile, claiming that \\"the referenced trademark would infringe fair competition\\". That same year, Redux Beverages released an energy shot called the Cocaine Energy Shot. The drink is available online and in local beverage stores around the U.S. The beverage is also available in Europe, where it has always been sold as Cocaine Energy Drink rather than \\"No Name\\" (as it was briefly sold in the U.S). According to Cocaine's official website, the drink is now being sold in three varieties: one being Original, one being \\"Cut\\" (which lacks the purported \\"throat-burning\\" sensation of Original), and one being \\"Free\\", which contains no sugar. Ingredients The ingredients are carbonated water, dextrose, citric acid, taurine, caffeine, natural flavors, sodium citrate, D-ribose, salt, sodium benzoate, inositol, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), sucralose, L-carnitine, potassium sorbate, guarana seed extract, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), and Red 40. According to Kirby, the drink contains 280 milligrams of caffeine.

It often is done in compliance with censors' guidelines, public authorities and community standards when female breasts are required to be covered in film or other media. If the arms are used instead of the hands the expression is arm bra. The use of long hair for this purpose is called a hair bra. A handbra may also be used by women to cover their breasts to maintain their modesty, when they find themselves with their breasts uncovered in front of others. Social conventions requiring females to cover their breasts in public have been widespread throughout history and across cultures. Contemporary Western cultures usually regard the exposure of the nipples and areolae as immodest and sometimes prosecute it as indecent exposure. However, the covering of the nipples and areolae in some manner is regarded as sufficient to maintain modesty and decency, at least within the letter if not the spirit of the censors' guidelines.  In cinema  At the start of the 20th century, the use of the handbra was not very common in European or American cinema, where toplessness and nudity was quite common. In the 1930s, the Hays Code brought an end to nudity in all its forms, including toplessness, in Hollywood films. To remain within the censors' guidelines or community standards of decency and modesty, breasts of actresses in an otherwise topless scene were required to be covered, especially the nipples and areolae, with their hands (using a handbra gesture), arms, towel, pasties, some other object, or the angle of the body in relation to the camera. Full nudity in film and toplessness, consisting of fully uncovered breasts, became more common in cinema after the 1960s, after which the use of the handbra technique or other obvious covering became less necessary and even pass√© or odd.  In print media  Similar community standards apply in other media, with female models being required to at least cover their breasts in some way. The handbra technique became less common and an unnecessary pose in early 20th century European and American pinup postcard media as toplessness and nudity became more common. In America, after bare breasts become repressed in mainstream media circa 1930, the handbra became an increasingly durable pose, especially as more widespread American pinup literature emerged in the 1950s. Once bare breasts became common in pinup literature, after the early 1960s, the handbra pose became less necessary. As with pinup magazines of the 1950s, the handbra pose was a mainstay of late 20th century mainstream media, especially lad mags, such as FHM, Maxim, and Zoo Weekly, that prominently featured photos of scantily clad actresses and models who wished to avoid topless and nude glamour photography. Examples include Brigitte Bardot (1955, 1971), Elizabeth Taylor in a Playboy magazine pictorial from the set of Cleopatra, Peggy Moffitt modeling Rudi Gernreich's topless maillot and how Life magazine handled the story (1964),Shana Alexander, \\"Fashion's Best Joke on Itself in Years\\", Life, July 10, 1964, p. 57Peggy Moffitt and William Claxton, The Rudi Gernreich Book, Rizzoli, New York, 1991 and the emergence of handbras in publications such as the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue by model Elle MacPherson (1989).Sports Illustrated, February 1989 Toward the end of the 20th century, the handbra appeared on numerous celebrity magazine covers. The August 1991 cover of Vanity Fair magazine, known as the More Demi Moore cover, contained a controversial handbra nude photograph of the then seven-months pregnant Demi Moore taken by Annie Leibovitz. Two years later Janet Jackson appeared on the September 1993 cover of Rolling Stone with her nipples covered by a pair of male hands. The magazine later named it their \\"Most Popular Cover Ever\\". In July 1994, Ronald Reagan's daughter Patti Davis appeared on the cover of Playboy with another model covering her breasts. Photographer Raphael Mazzucco created an eight-woman handbra on the cover of the 2006 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and a photo of Marisa Miller covering her breasts with her arms and her vulva with an iPod in the 2007 Swimsuit Issue. The handbra was the subject of a pointed parody advertisement for Holding Your Own Boobs magazine performed by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Will Ferrell on the May 15, 1999 episode of Saturday Night Live. Websites In 2014 Playboy Enterprises made its Playboy.com website \\"safe for work\\" by covering nipples with handbras and armbras. Other uses There is a brassiere named the \\"handbra\\" that is fashioned in the shape of hands as a parody of the technique. Lady Gaga wore one in the music video for her 2013 single \\"Applause\\".

Found only 4 km from the center of Chania on the island of Crete, it is known for its small protected woods, for a summer beach volleyball competition, and as a favorite beach for winter swimmers. Agioi Apostoloi is located between the city of Chania to the east, and the summer resorts of Agia Marina and Platanias to the west. Many inhabitants of Chania visit the sandy beaches during the weekends because they are close to the city, they have sport facilities and in the end they are quite warm even from the first weeks of the summer. There are three different beaches in Agioi Apostoloi, each one situated in its own small bay. The most well-known beach in the village is called Chrissi Akti (\\"Golden Beach\\"), due to the gold colour of the sand. The second of Agioi Apostoli's beaches is a horseshoe shaped sandy cove which is popular with swimmers. The beach is 500 metres long and 50 metres wide and can be accessed via wooden boards and ramps. The beach has received a Blue Flag award. The third beach is the smallest beach in this Municipality at 300 metres long and 20 metres wide. The beach is approached by wooden boards and ramps and again has Blue Flag status. The village of Agioi Apostoloi is also known for its sardine feast. During the feast, many locals and tourists gather here to freely taste the grilled sardines, drink raki or tsikoudia, and listen to traditional Cretan music. The waterfront of the Agioi Apostoloi (the park included) is under preservation by the authorities, therefore there is still some green space next to the sea. The local flora consists of many Pine, Nerium oleander, Palmaes and Eucalyptus trees. Sea Daffodil, a rare and protected species with large, delicate, white flowers and a strong scent, also grows in the area. Environmental educational projects take place throughout the year, particularly regarding the Loggerhead sea turtles that use the coastline to breed. In the past few years there has been discussion in the local community about whether Agii Apostoli should be protected from any kind of tourist development.

History and Development  In 1969 John and Essie Rosser, local honey producers, donated 2.02ha to the city for the establishment of a park. In 2000, Council formally ratified this park, then known as 'Rosser Park', as the city's botanical garden. The development of the master plan for the botanic gardens involved more than 18 months' investigation, site analysis and community consultation. The plan was finally adopted by City of Gold Coast in 2002. In November 2003, the master plan for what was then proposed to be a $12 million project received acclaim for its design and community involvement. The inaugural Community Tree Planting Day and opening ceremony was held on 27 July 2003. By February 2006, the garden's transformation was well underway, with the new rose garden and a mangrove-to- mountains section having been recently completed.

The series attempted to capitalize on the success of the motion picture National Lampoon's Animal House. It was the third of three \\"frat house\\" comedy series to air in early 1979 (the others were ABC's Delta House and NBC's Brothers and Sisters). CBS cancelled Co-Ed Fever after only one episode, and all three series were off the air by the end of April 1979. The series was so low rated, it never made it to its regular time slot, Monday night, instead having aired as a \\"special preview\\" the night before.(11 February 1979). \\"Co-Ed Fever\\" Expires, Bonham Daily Favorite (UPI story) In 2002, Co-Ed Fever ranked number 32 on TV Guides 50 Worst Shows of All Time list. Synopsis The series was set in Brewster House, a dormitory on the campus of Baxter College, a formerly all-female college that had just started to admit male students.(12 January 1979). College fun big success in Hollywood, Montreal Gazette (UPI story) Co- Ed Fever starred Heather Thomas (as Sandi), Alexa Kenin (Maria a.k.a. \\"Mousie\\"), Cathryn O'Neil (Elizabeth), Tacey Phillips (Hope), and Jillian Kesner (Melba) as residents of Brewster House, who are joined by David Keith (Tucker Davis), Christopher S. Nelson (Doug), and Michael Pasternak (Gobo). Jane Rose played the \\"spaced-out\\" housemother Mrs. Selby; Hamilton Camp was Mr. Peabody. The episode \\"Pepperoni Passion\\" was aired as a \\"special preview\\" at 10:30 pm (ET) on February 4, immediately after the airing of the movie Rocky; however, the series was cancelled in the interim between this airing and the scheduled premiere date (February 19), the result of low ratings aside from viewer complaints and censorship issues because of content (a problem that also affected its rival shows). Six episodes were completed, but only \\"Pepperoni Passion\\" was broadcast in the United States; however, all six were aired in Canada (on BCTV in Vancouver) in a late-afternoon weekend timeslot. The Brewster House \\"set\\" was later reused as the girls' dormitory during the first season of The Facts of Life, which premiered during the summer of 1979. Another new sitcom, Billy, was scheduled on CBS in Co-Ed Fever's regular timeslot, instead. By airing once, Co-Ed Fever at least fared better than Mr. Dugan, another sitcom that CBS planned to air during the spring of 1979; the Norman Lear-produced comedy about a black congressman never aired at all, due to complaints from real black congressmen.

By the end of the 1st century AD, the Roman forces were evacuated from the peninsula. Several decades later the camp was restored by a vexillatio of the Legio I Italica; it hosted a detachment of the Legio XI Claudia at the end of the 2nd century. The camp was abandoned by the Romans in the mid-3rd century. The ruins of the camp were discovered by Peter Keppen in 1837; he estimated the length of the defensive wall at 185 sazhens (395 meters). Keppen identified the site with Charax (from the Greek word for \\"fortification\\"), the only Roman camp recorded in Crimea. Although there is no evidence that Charax was situated near Ai- Todor, the name stuck. Intrigued by Keppen's publication, Count Shuvalov funded the first (and rather amateurish) excavations of the site in 1849. In 1896, excavations were resumed under the supervision of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, who had his summer dacha constructed in the immediate vicitinity of the ruins and the 1865 lighthouse. The excavations lasted for fifteen years and yielded a great number of Roman coins and bronze artifacts. Michael Rostovtzeff, who oversaw the excavations on behalf of the St. Petersburg University, classed Charax as the \\"entire Roman city\\", rather than just a fort, as was previously thought.Page about Charax on the website of the Crimean government. A museum of archaeological finds was opened at Charax in 1907. Further exploration of the site, undertaken by Vladimir Blavatsky in 1931-35, revealed remains of two public water basins, thermae, and an aqueduct. There were also a gymnasium and a sanctuary outside the walls. Blavatsky and his followers lent their support to Rostovtzeff's theory that the most ancient line of cyclopean walls at Charax was erected by the Tauri before the arrival of Romans,\\"In Charax, the Roman defences consisted partially of cyclopean walls erected by the Tauri and two new lines of fairly carelessly laid stone walls. Most of the buildings were concentrated in quite a small area (not above a hectare and a half) enclosed by the upper wall. In this area there were small stone and brick houses, water drains made of clay pipes and a reservoir with a mosaic portrayal of an octopus\\". Quoted from: A.L. Mongait. Archaeology in the USSR.

A member of the genus Camponotus in the subfamily Formicinae, it was described by German entomologist Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson in 1842. Its common name refers to the ant's liking for sugar and sweet food, as well as the distinctive orange-brown band that wraps around its gaster. The ant is polymorphic and relatively large, with two different castes of workers: major workers (also known as soldiers), and minor workers. These two group of workers measure around in length, while the queen ants are even larger. Mainly nocturnal, banded sugar ants prefer a mesic habitat, and are commonly found in forests and woodlands. They also occur in urban areas, where they are considered a household pest. The ant's diet includes sweet secretions that are retrieved from aphids and other insects that it tends. This species is a competitor of the meat ant (Iridomyrmex purpureus), and food robbery and nest-plugging is known to occur between these two ants. Workers prey on insects, killing them with a spray of formic acid. Banded sugar ants are preyed upon by other ants, echidnas, and birds. The eggs of this species were consumed by Indigenous Australians. Taxonomy The banded sugar ant was first described by German entomologist Wilhelm Ferdinand Erichson, who named it Formica consobrina in 1842. The holotype specimen is a queen collected from Tasmania, which is now housed in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin. Formica consobrina was later moved to the genus Camponotus as Camponotus consobrinus, by entomologist Julius Roger in 1863. In 1933, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler described some subspecies and variants of the banded sugar ant. These subspecies were C. consobrinus lividipes and C. consobrinus nigriceps, while the variants were C. consobrinus var. obniger and C. consobrinus var. perthianus. Some of these classifications were short-lived; C. consobrinus nigriceps was later revived as a full species in 1934 as C. nigriceps, while C. consobrinus lividipes was synonymised with C. consobrinus. C. consobrinus lividipes was treated as a subspecies for C. nigriceps in 1985, now known as C. nigriceps lividipes. In 1996 C. consobrinus perthianus was synonymised with C. nigriceps, and C. consobrinus var. obniger was synonymised with C. consobrinus. The specific name is derived from the Latin word consobrina, meaning \\"cousin\\". This is in reference to its similar appearance with the species C. herculeanus. The ant is a member of the Camponotus nigriceps species group, which also includes C. clarior, C. dryandrae, C. eastwoodi, C. loweryi, C. longideclivis, C. nigriceps, C. pallidiceps and C. prostans. The species is commonly known as the banded sugar ant or sugar ant due to its attraction to sweet food and the orange-brown band that is present on its gaster. Description Banded sugar ants appear in different forms, varying from in length, making them a large species. Banded sugar ants are polymorphic, and colonies have two types of workers: minor workers and major workers that have different size ranges. The two castes can be identified easily, due to the workers being smaller and more slender, while the soldiers are larger and more robust. Both castes carry a set of powerful mandibles. Queen ants are the largest ants in the colony. Banded sugar ants come in a variety of colours, possibly due to ecological rather than genetic influences. For example, humidity, insolation and temperature may all affect the colour of an individual. Female banded sugar ants are easily recognised by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males of the species are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21. The related black- headed sugar ant (Camponotus nigriceps) has a similar appearance and may be mistaken for a banded sugar ant. Black-headed sugar ants are lighter in colour than banded sugar ants and the orange-brown band is absent from their gaster. Distribution and habitat Banded sugar ants rebuild their nest entrance following rain The banded sugar ant is one of the most widely distributed ants in Australia, but is most commonly found in south-east Australia. It occurs along the north-east coast of Queensland, from Charters Towers in the north to Brisbane in the south. The ant is widespread in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania. In South Australia, it is a common household pest in Adelaide, and populations are mostly found in the south-east of the state while the species is absent in the north-west. The banded sugar ant's presence in Western Australia has yet to be verified. These ants are found in urban areas, eucalypt forests, dry sclerophyll woodland, grasslands and heaths, preferring a mesic habitat. In the drier regions of Australia, the banded sugar ant is absent and is usually replaced by Camponotus nigriceps. Banded sugar ants have been recorded from elevations ranging from . Nests are found in a variety of sites, including holes in wood, roots of plants, twigs of trees and shrubs, between rocks, in the soil, and under paving stones. Sometimes, banded sugar ant colonies form small mounds, which are less than 20 cm (8 in) in diameter and usually funnel-shaped and ephemeral. Mounds are not constructed in undisturbed regions where land degradation has not occurred. Instead, the entrance of a nest consists of a smooth-walled vertical shaft that is in diameter. Chambers in the nest have a similar appearance to the nest entrance (shaft-like walls), and the floors within the chambers are typically in length with an arched roof that is in height. Excavated meat ant nests show that banded sugar ants will also inhabit them. Behaviour and ecology Workers recruit additional nestmates to exploit newly discovered food sources by the method of tandem running. The lead worker (on the left) has returned to the nest and is leading the remaining workers back to the food source. Banded sugar ants are the dominant group of nocturnal ants in their range. Workers are mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2‚Äì35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running. Banded sugar ants will often attack the nests of other ant species at random, while ignoring other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues to help them find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend off an attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators. The meat ant, a known competitor of the banded sugar ant A common competitor of sugar ants are meat ants, which have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during the early hours of the day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. In a 1999 study, Pogonoscopus myrmex leafhoppers were placed in a banded sugar ant colony to test the reaction of non-host ants. These leafhoppers were attacked, suggesting no symbiotic relationship between the two. Starlings have been observed to rub banded sugar ants on their feathers and skin, a behaviour known as anting. Diet and predators Banded sugar ants are omnivores and feed on sweet substances. They tend plant- eating insects such as aphids, and feed on the fluids they secrete. Honeydew secretions are produced from the anus of the aphid, which is later provided to the ants. This behaviour is mutually beneficial to both organisms, as the ants protect the aphids from predation and the aphids provides a nutritious liquid to the ants. Banded sugar ants also tend the larvae of the southern purple azure butterfly (Ogyris genoveva). They are visitors to flowers of Eucalyptus globulus trees, where they can act as pollinators. They may be seen at night foraging under lights in urban areas for arthropod prey, such as termites and the southern cattle tick (Rhipicephalus microplus). During the night, banded sugar ants are known to \\"rob\\" food sources excreted by Hemiptera insects that are fed on by meat ants during the day. Banded sugar ants and meat ants tend to nest near one another, and areas where the two ants forage have shorter foraging periods due to interference between the species. However, banded sugar ants are nocturnal while meat ants are not, so foraging periods are extended by one or two hours if no interference occurs. Banded sugar ants have been found in the feces of the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), and non-passerine birds are known to predate them. The blackish blindsnake (Ramphotyphlops nigrescens) follows trails laid by banded sugar ants, possibly to locate them as potential prey. Blindsnakes are also known to consume the brood of this species. Nematodes are a parasite to banded sugar ant larvae, as several mermithergate larvae were described. Infected individuals are recognisable by their swollen gasters; for example, uninfected ants measuring in length have a gaster length of while the gaster of infected individuals who are similar in size is . Some specimens collected had gasters so swollen that the intersegmental-membrane was exposed. Life cycle and reproduction Queens exiting a nest for nuptial flight Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a female; if not, it will become a male. They develop through complete metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults. Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that contains a single queen), some have been found to be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January; and in early December in Southeast Queensland (2017). This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20‚Äì25 ¬∞C (68‚Äì77 ¬∞F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies. Workers that belong to different matrilines (female ancestry) appear significantly different from each other in size. Matrilines are also said to influence caste determination within the species. Interaction with humans The banded sugar ant is considered a household pest and is occasionally seen in houses at night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; carbon disulphide is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray formic acid, however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the formic acid they spray is corrosive to human skin.

The school was formerly known as \\"Heaton Manor School.\\" It was renamed \\"Jesmond Park Academy\\" in 2019. The school building, fully rebuilt in 2004 from PFI funding replaced two separate sites (known as the Jesmond and Benton sites) which in turn were made up of a number of different schools. History Before 2004, Years 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 were housed on the \\"Jesmond Site\\" situated in buildings between Jesmond Park West and Newton Road. The main building was built in the 1920s, with a 1960s gym to the west and another addition to the north of the building, which was attached to it by a bridge walkway. Years 10 and 11 were housed half a mile away on the \\"Benton Site\\", a purpose built 1960s former Secondary Technical school on Benton Road, opposite the Benton Park View governmental office complex. Heaton Grammar and Heaton High Schools The buildings on Newton Road were opened by King George V in 1928 after opening the Tyne Bridge. The school building was symmetrical; everything found on one side of the school was mirrored on the opposite side. The western side of the building was Heaton Grammar School for boys with an entrance on Jesmond Park West and the eastern side of the building was Heaton High School for girls, again with a separate entrance on Newton Road. Manor Park Technical Grammar School Across on Benton Road was Manor Park Technical Grammar School opened in 1960, following the Tripartite System of Grammar, Technical Grammar, and Secondary Modern schooling in England. This school, completely separate from Heaton Grammar and High Schools was initially on the Benton Road site only (1960-1966) then from 1967 expanded to encompass two sites itself. The lower site, which was on Addycombe Terrace, is now the Heaton Centre (for adult education) and Heaton Community Centre.  Heaton Manor School  Newcastle City Council's budget cuts meant that schools with low numbers had to be closed and it was decided to merge Heaton Secondary School with Manor Park School, in 1983, to form a new school: Heaton Manor School. Originally, the sixth form (Years 12 and 13) were going to be housed on the former Manor Park site, but this was not possible due to the nature of the buildings. The former Heaton Grammar site (located on Jesmond Park West) became known as the \\"Jesmond Site\\", whilst the former Manor Park site (located on Benton Road) became known as the \\"Benton Site\\". The rooms on the Jesmond site had a \\"J-\\" prefix (e.g. J44, JP1, JD1) to distinguish the same rooms over on the Benton site which had a \\"B-\\" prefix (e.g. B75, BP2, BD1) Before 2001, the library was found on the upper south- west corridor and there were two halls (east and west). In 2001, the west hall became a new \\"Learning Resource Centre\\" and the former library suite was rebuilt and became a British Airways sponsored suite for those studying Travel and Tourism. Back in 1998, a number of students were featured along with John Dryden and Ann Smedley (Headteacher and Deputy Headteacher respectively) on the front page of the Evening Chronicle with the headline \\"Thanks a Mi¬£¬£ion!\\" after Heaton Manor had secured money for a complete refurbishment. Building of the new school Building work commenced in 2002 with the new school being built \\"upon\\" the old one ‚Äì which required the East half of the school to be demolished in the summer of 2003 and work to commence on the footprint of the old east side and the front and back fields. This meant that from September 2003 until the summer of 2004, the school was truly half old, half new. Three new buildings were open for use and the west side of the old building was still being used. After July 2004, the Benton Road site was closed and soon after was demolished, to make way for the housing development named after it, as \\"Manor Park\\". The remaining old buildings on the Jesmond site were then fully demolished and the remainder of the new buildings were built. The new school was ready for service in September 2004. Jesmond Park Academy As of 2018, the school's last inspection was in 2016, when it was judged Inadequate. Due to the inadequate judgement, it was announced that the school would become an academy, starting on the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year. The new academy caused controversy in the local community as it discarded the area that is was located, Heaton, with the new name, Jesmond Park Academy. Academic performance In 2018, the school's Progress 8 score at GCSE was below average, but the Attainment 8 score was above average. Activities There is an extensive \\"period seven\\" programme which offers extra-curricular activities. There are many sports teams as well as \\"booster\\" lessons in most subjects. Heaton Manor is also a member of Amnesty International. The school participates in many sporting competitions. Debating One of the Period Seven activities that was offered was the Heaton Manor Union Society, which was the school's Debating Society for students in Key Stages Three and Four. The Society was founded in 2006 by the Department of Citizenship. Its weekly meetings involved a debate on a pre-released topic, featuring two pairs arguing for or against the motion respectively. A vote is held, and a team of judges also selected a winner. On 10 May 2008, two of the Society's members participated in the national finals of the International Competition for Young Debaters, in Oxford. This was widely regarded as a great achievement, as very few comprehensive schools qualified.http://icyd.com/index.php?module=documents&JAS;_DocumentManager_op=downloadFile&JAS;_File_id=33 Heaton Manor also maintained a Post 16 debating team, \\"The Head Strong Club\\".

Amateur career During the late 1990s, Tugade joined up with fellow Pangasinense Danny Ildefonso to lead the NU Bulldogs to decent finishes in the UAAP. Tugade, then became NU's primary offense player after Ildefonso's departure to the PBL. He later join the Red Bull Energy Drink squad in the Philippine Basketball League with Ildefonso and later Junthy Valenzuela, Jimwell Torion, Davonn Harp and Kerby Raymundo. Still, Red Bull failed to win a single title in the PBL. PBA career Red Bull Barako In 2000, Red Bull moved up to the PBA ranks as its 10th member. Newly installed head coach Yeng Guiao, the same man who guided the PBL as its commissioner from 1997‚Äì99, picked Tugade as one of six direct-hire players from their amateur team. He played a limited role during his first three seasons in the league and was instrumental in Red Bull's two title victories in the 2001 and 2002 Commissioner's Cup tournaments. By the 2004-05 season, Tugade's role increased after the franchise retooled its lineup following losses to Davonn Harp, Willie Miller, and for a while, Mick Pennisi. Along with Enrico Villanueva both led Red Bull to a surprising semifinals appearance in the 2005 Fiesta Conference. At the 2005 Fiesta Conference, through the effort of Tugade, Villanueva, the return of Pennisi, the acquisition of rookie shooting guard Larry Fonacier, the much-suited import James Penny, and the other tough players from the team, Red Bull won the Fiesta Conference crown and the club's first title in four years. In Game 2 against the Purefoods Chunkee Giants, Tugade outscored all locals with 30 points before eventually winning the championship. He was named the Finals Most Valuable Player for the first time in his PBA career. The next conference, Tugade averaged 56.7 percent from the three-point distance, the highest of his career and became the league's leading three-point shooter during the 2006 Philippine Cup. The Bulls made it to the finals but lost to Purefoods in six games. At the end of the season, he ranked fourth in the MVP race and became part of the First Mythical Team selection for the first time in his career. San Miguel Beermen At the start of the 2006-07 PBA Philippine Cup, Tugade was sidelined with an injury and missed the first part of the conference. However, he was later traded to San Miguel in a three-way deal that also involved Rommel Adducul of the Barangay Ginebra Kings. With a strong lineup, Tugade played a limited role for the Beermen as he was still recuperating from his injury while sharing minutes with Danny Seigle, Chris Calaguio and Dondon Hontiveros. He did posted significant numbers for San Miguel during their long eight-game winning streak. Tugade is one of the PBA's best three point shooter along with James Yap, teammate Dondon Hontiveros and Jimmy Alapag. Since 2008, Tugade has been plagued by injuries, playing only 64 games from 2008‚Äì11. Tugade's minutes also began to decrease in his tenure with San Miguel. Final season and retirement Tugade did not fully recover from his injuries but played all of the 32 games in the 2011 season. Tugade was traded to the Powerade along with Rabeh Al-Hussaini and Rey Guevarra before the start of the 2012 Governor's Cup, where he played only 10 games, again, because of injuries. At the end of the season, he decided to retire because of his injuries.

History The origins of CNGI date to 2001 when 57 members of the Chinese Academy of Science and Chinese Academy of Engineering wrote a letter to the State Council recommending construction of the next generation academic Internet. In 2002 the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) organized a study of the topic, and in 2003 the study group submitted a strategic report. After authorization, the CNGI was then launched under the auspices of eight ministries: NDRC as the lead, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information Industry, the State Council Information Office, Chinese Academy of Science, Chinese Academy of Engineering, and the National Natural Science Foundation. Current status As of October 2009, the CNGI effort comprises six nationwide backbone networks and 39 GigaPOPs (Gigapop is short for gigabit point-of-presence, an access point to Internet2), which extends the next generation footprint to over 20 major cities and over 300 academic, industrial, and government research campuses within China. Five backbones are commercial (operated by China Telecom, China Unicom, China Netcom/CSTNET, China Mobile, and China Railcom), with an additional academic research network operated by CERNET, which is known as CNGI-CERNET2. CNGI also encompasses two exchange points (IX) in Beijing (named CNGI-6IX) and Shanghai for interconnecting these backbones and for international links to APAN (Asia Pacific Advanced Network), GEANT, and Internet2.

is India‚Äôs imaging-intelligence organisation, a part of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;). The first head of the ARC was R. N. Kao, the founding chief of R&AW.; Over the years the ARC has grown into a large operation and flies a large and varied fleet that till recently included the high-flying Mach 3 capable MIG-25. Inventory The ARC began operations in 1962 with a Helio Twin Courier loaned from the USAF. ARC operates fixed-wing transport aircraft like Russian IL-76s and AN-32s. It also has General Dynamics Gulfstream III and Global 5000 jets. The helicopter inventory comprises Russian Mil Mi-17s and a mix of locally built Cheetahs (modified French Alouette IIs) and Chetaks (Alouette IIIs). The MIG-25 (also christened as Foxbat by NATO) was used for high altitude reconnaissance until being decommissioned in 2006. ARC is also believed to be the first wing of Indian intelligence agencies to induct the indigenously built 'Pilotless Target Aircraft' (PTA) Lakshya. Lakshya is equipped with advanced support system to help it perform tactful aerial exploration in the battlefield, including target acquisition. The Lakshya is fitted with a digitally controlled engine that can be operated from the ground using a remote. Lakshya had been designed by Aeronautical Development Establishment, Bangalore. Lakshya is a surface/ship launched high subsonic reusable aerial target system, remotely piloted from ground. It provides training to the gun and missile crew and to air defence pilots for weapon engagement. Bases According to a report from Globalsecurity.org, R&AW; Aviation Research Centre previously or currently operates bases at Charbatia Air Base in Choudwar, Cuttack district (largest base); Sarsawa Air Base near Saharanpur on the Uttar Pradesh-Haryana border; Dum Duma Air Base near Tinsukia in Assam; Palam Air Base in Delhi; and the Farkhor Air Base, the only Indian military base situated in a foreign country, at Farkhor/Ayni in Tajikistan.Asia Times Online :: South Asia news - India's foray into Central AsiaDum Duma Air Station In 2018 the Duma Duma Air Base was identified as one of 15 disused airfields that could be transferred to other public agencies.

Kargil War In 1999 during the Kargil War, after the Pakistani intrusion was detected, ARC was tasked to check if the Pakistanis had indeed crossed the Line of Control to the Indian side and violated the border agreement. A number of missions were flown by the ARC on request from the Indian Army and the PMO. Senior officials of the Indian armed forces including the Chief of Air Staff and Chief of Army staff highly commended the work done by ARC, quoting \\"The electronic and optical information provided by the ARC before and during the actual operations was of immense value to the conduct of air strikes.\\" Air Marshal Ashok Goel's blog post-Secrets of RAW Also the K.

It is closely related to Gardiner's frog, Sechellophryne gardineri. The Seychelles palm frog inhabits forests higher than above sea level and is closely associated with the palm Phoenicophorium borsigianum (another Seychelles endemic); most individuals are found in axils of the palm. It is the most arboreal of the Sooglossidae. As a result, the palm frog is the most recent species of the family to have been discovered (in 2000). The reproductive biology of this species is unknown, but it is presumed to involve direct development, i.e. eggs that hatch directly into froglets. IUCN has reassessed the species in 2012 and concluded that Seychelles palm frog should be considered as \\"Critically Endangered\\" because of its small area of occupancy (about 7 km¬≤), decline in population size, and threats to its habitat.

Sawfish display a circumglobal distribution in warm marine and freshwater habitats. Their extant biodiversity is limited to five species belonging to two genera (Pristis and Anoxypristis). The sawfishes are characterised by the long, narrow, flattened rostrum or extension on their snout. This is lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged in a way that resemble the teeth of a saw and are used for killing prey. It is found in the shallow coastal waters and estuaries of the Indo-West Pacific, ranging from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to southern Japan, Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. It is the only living member of the genus Anoxypristis, but was previously included in the genus Pristis. Compared to Pristis, Anoxypristis has a narrower rostral saw with numerous teeth on the distal part and no teeth on the basal one-quarter (toothless section about one-sixth in juveniles). This endangered species reaches a length of up to 3.5 m (11.5 ft). In addition to the living Anoxypristis cuspidata, this genus includes a few extinct species that are only known from fossil remains. Description Knifetooth sawfish in 2014. The narrow sawfish grows to a maximum length of about 3.5 m (11.5 ft), although there are highly questionable and unconfirmed claims of much larger individuals. Its body is generally shark-like, but its most obvious feature is the flattened head, which is extended forward in a blade-like bony snout with, in Australian waters, 18 to 22 pairs of sideways-facing teeth. However, elsewhere there may be as many as 25. These teeth are short, flat, and roughly triangular in shape. The blade does not taper towards its point and in adults, the basal one-quarter is devoid of teeth. In juveniles, about one-sixth of the base is toothless. The nostrils are narrow and partially concealed by nasal flaps. The skin of young sawfish is smooth, but on older individuals, it is sparsely covered in dermal denticles. The dorsal (upper) side of the fish is greyish and the ventral (lower) side and fins are a pale grey color. The rostrum is grey with white teeth and sometimes has a chocolate-brown base portion. Distribution and habitat The Narrow Sawfish is distributed across a broad swathe of the Indo-Pacific Ocean. It is present in the waters off Iran, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Burma, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. At its western extreme, it is present in the Arabian Sea and may extend as far as Somalia. Its northern limit is the Gulf of Chihli, China, South Korea, and the most southerly parts of Japan, and its southern limit is the northern Australian states of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. The Narrow Sawfish is bentho-pelagic and is found at depths of about 100 meters (328 ft). The Narrow Sawfish prefers soft bottom-substrates, such as sand, mud, or seagrass, to rocky or coraline habitats. It can tolerate low salinity levels and is found in inshore waters, including bays and estuaries. The Narrow Sawfish is euryhaline, meaning it can tolerate a wide range of salinity and move between estuarine and marine environments. It undergoes an ontogenetic shift in habitat. Larger individuals are commonly found offshore, whereas smaller individuals are found inshore. Females are also more likely to be found offshore. The Narrow Sawfish is suspected to be locally extinct in the coastal waters of Vietnam due to commercial fishing (especially trawling), coastal development, and subsequent habitat loss. Behavior  Reproduction and Life History  The breeding behavior of the Narrow Sawfish has been little studied. Fertilization is internal, and a number of young develop at one time in the oviduct, each one being nourished from a yolk sac. Mating season varies by geographic region, and pups are born after a gestational period of about five months. Litter sizes range from 6 to 23 pups with an average of 12. The pups are usually 43 - 61 cm long at birth, and their rostral teeth are not fully developed, being covered by a membrane, which prevents them from damaging the mother's tissues. Only two studies have been conducted on the age and growth of the narrow sawfish. The longest lived narrow sawfish found was 9 years old. However, the theoretical longevity is calculated to be 27 years. Females begin to mature at 8 feet 1 inch total length and are fully mature at 15 feet 5 inches. Males are fully mature at 8 feet total length.  Temperament  The narrow sawfish is docile towards humans and not large enough to consider them as prey. If left undisturbed, it is harmless towards people. However, when highly stressed, such as when caught in a net, narrow sawfish will flail their heads from side to side to defend themselves. This can potentially inflict serious injury on unprotected persons who get too close.  Diet  The narrow sawfish feeds on small fish, squid, and invertebrates such as crabs and shrimp. It uses its rostrum in a side-to- side thrashing action to stir up the sediment and uncover concealed prey. It can also use its rostrum among schools of fish to incapacitate or stun individual fish. The head and rostrum of the sawfish contain thousands of electroreception organs called ampullae of lorenzini, which allow it to sense and locate the electric fields of its prey. The narrow sawfish is itself prey to various sharks such as the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna spp.), the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) and also the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus). Conservation Status  Threats  Human actions are the main cause of the declining Narrow Sawfish populations and ranges. Overutilization, primarily from commercial fisheries, is its biggest threat. Narrow Sawfish populations have likely decreased between 50 and 70% over the last 20 years. The Narrow Sawfish is a high-value target for fishermen. Sawfish are commonly hunted to make shark fin soup or for their rostrums to be displayed as trophies. Most countries have regulations against catching it; however, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing remains a threat. Furthermore, the Narrow Sawfish is a common bycatch for fisheries in its geographic range. The toothed rostrum makes it vulnerable to most types of fishing gear, particularly nets. Damaged, neglected, or lost fishing gear (aka ghost nets) are also a considerable threat to Narrow Sawfish. Pregnant females and juveniles are at the highest risk for this threat. Additionally, the Narrow Sawfish has the highest post-release mortality of any sawfish species. Habitat loss and water pollution are also threats to the Narrow Sawfish. Coastal development, coastline urbanisation, and an expanding mining industry result in the modification and destruction of critical habitat. Furthermore, the pollution from these activities degrades the water quality. The Narrow Sawfish range is suspected to have declined by 30% from historic extent. These threats are expected to become more significant as the human population grows. Natural threats, such as disease and predation, do not significantly harm the Narrow Sawfish population.  IUCN Status  The IUCN listed the Narrow Sawfish as \\"Endangered\\" in its Red List of Threatened Species in the year 2000. This was due to the threats of overutilization, habitat loss, and a decreasing population. Its status was updated to ‚ÄúCritically Endangered‚Äù in 2006. In 2013, its status returned to ‚ÄúEndangered‚Äù due to the availability of new information.  ESA Listing  On September 10, 2010, WildEarth Guardians petitioned the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to list six sawfish species - the Narrow Sawfish; the Dwarf Sawfish, the Freshwater Sawfish, the Common Sawfish, the Narrowsnout Sawfish, and the Smalltooth Sawfish - as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act.WildEarth Guardians (2010). ‚ÄúA Petition: Requesting the Secretary of Commerce to Add Six Critically Endangered Sawfish Species to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species Maintained Under the Authority of the Endangered Species Act.‚Äù NOAA Fisheries. Retrieved 27 May 2020 The NMFS published a 90-day review on March 7, 2011, stating that action may be warranted for five of the six species. Information available at the time indicated that the Common Sawfish was not a valid species. On June 4, 2013, the NMFS published a proposal that concluded all five Sawfish species were at high risk for extinction. The proposal listed habitat loss, water quality, and overutilization as the biggest threats to the Narrow Sawfish. The NMFS published its final ruling on December 12, 2014, which listed all five Sawfish species as endangered. Scientific data showed that geographical areas occupied by the Narrow Sawfish were entirely outside U.S. jurisdiction. Therefore, the NMFS was not able to designate any critical habitat. Furthermore, the NMFS did not develop a recovery plan because they would not be able to enforce it.  Conservation Efforts  Western Australia and Queensland have listed protections for the Narrow Sawfish as a ‚Äúno-take‚Äù species. Sawfish also are considered ‚Äúno-take‚Äù species in India, but the legislation is frequently ignored and rarely enforced. International trade of the narrow sawfish has been banned by its inclusion in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix 1. Current population of the Narrow Sawfish is unknown.

The earliest records of accession celebrations date from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and the custom is now observed in many nations. Accession Day in India's Jammu and Kashmir commemorates the day in 1947 when the area joined the Dominion of India. Belgium In Belgium there are local celebrations of the reigning monarch's accession, but the anniversary of the accession of the first King of modern Belgium, Leopold I, on 21 July 1831, is celebrated as a full national holiday, known as \\"Belgian National Day\\".See page 9 of this document from the Belgian Federal Government website. Indian subcontinent Accession Day is a state holiday in India's northernmost state, Jammu and Kashmir, commemorating 26 October 1947, when Maharaja Hari Singh signed off the Instrument of Accession, in which Jammu and Kashmir joined the Dominion of India. This was part of the series of events in 1947 by which rule the Indian Empire was converted into the two new Dominions of India and Pakistan, the latter having two territories separated by the whole of northern India. As a Hindu ruler of a state with both Hindu and Muslim subjects, the Maharaja's decision was crucial. Festivities of the day include holding rallies, lighting firecrackers, singing India's national anthem, and raising the flag of India. Netherlands Koninginnedag (Queen's Day) was, during the reign of Queen Beatrix, celebrated on 30 April, the date of her accession in 1980 upon the abdication of her mother, Queen Juliana, whose birthday fell on 30 April). Beatrix abdicated on Koninginnedag 2013 which, led to the accession of King Willem-Alexander. As a result, the holiday became known as Koningsdag (King's Day) from 2014 and the celebration was moved three days ahead to 27 April, to instead mark the birthday of Willem- Alexander. United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates is unusual in celebrating the accession of its President, although the President is elected from amongst the seven hereditary Emirs (ruling Princes) of the constituent states of the UAE, and is therefore also a hereditary and monarchical leader. Accession Day is a national holiday in the UAE.Details of the celebration on 6 August.  United Kingdom  The custom of marking this day was inaugurated during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Her accession day was celebrated in England and Wales during her reign and also, according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Lathbury, during the reigns of her successors.\\"According to Lathbury, the 17th day of November, the day of the Queen's accession, was observed even after Elizabeth's death as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God for the gracious deliverance wrought out for the Church by her instrumentality.\\" (Evan Daniel, The Prayer-Book; its history, language and contents; 26th ed. Redhill: Wells Gardner (1948), p. 535.) A \\"Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving\\" to be used in churches on the anniversary of the queen's accession was published in 1576 and used until 1602. In 1568, the tenth anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession was marked with the ringing of bells and 17 November became known as \\"Queen Elizabeth's Day\\" or \\"Queene's Day\\".Chambers Book of Days, Edinburgh: Chambers, 2004 () p.553 ff. As her reign progressed, it was celebrated with increased fervour and, long after her death, it continued to be observed as a day of Protestant rejoicing and expression of anti-Catholic feeling. The observances included triumphal parades and processions, sermons against populism and the burning of the Pope in effigy. After the Great Fire of London (1666), \\"these rejoicings were converted into a satirical saturnalia of the most turbulent kind\\"; the greatest excesses occurred in the years 1679‚Äì81 when wealthy members of political clubs paid for processions and bonfires to arouse the populace to political fervour. The inhabitants of Berry Pomeroy in south Devon reinstated the tradition of Queene's Day in 2005 with a special church service and bonfire. On the accession of King James I of England, a form of prayer and thanksgiving was issued for use in all churches \\"upon his entry to this kingdom\\".Daniel Prayer-Book, p. 535. In 1625, a new service was issued which was sanctioned by Convocation in 1640 but set aside by Parliament at the Restoration when certain parts of it were included in the special service for 29 May. When King James II acceded the throne, he ordered the preparation of a special form of prayer and thanksgiving for the anniversary of his accession day and a revised version of the old service was prepared and set forth by authority in 1685. The form of words \\"the day on which His Majesty began his happy reign\\" was first used in this service and has been retained ever since. After falling out of use during the reigns of William III and Mary II, the service was revised and used again during the reign of Queen Anne.Daniel Prayer-Book, p. 536. King George V's accession day (reigned 1910‚Äì36) was 6 May.Hoe & Co's Travellers' Diary for 1927. Madras: Hoe & Co, p. 11. The present monarch, Elizabeth II's accession day is 6 February and is observed in the United Kingdom by the flying of specific flags and various official functions. In London, a Royal Salute is fired by the guns of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park and by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London. Salutes are also fired at Woolwich, Colchester, Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, Cardiff, Belfast, York, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Dover Castle. Special services are required by canon in all cathedrals, churches, and chapels of the Church of England. The Book of Common Prayer provides options for a stand-alone Accession Day service, or for special propers by which any or all of the services of Matins, Evensong and Holy Communion may be altered for the day.All these options are available on-line at here. The Church's more recent prayer book Common Worship does not provide a full form of service, but refers the user to the Book of Common Prayer; it does, however, provide propers for the Eucharist on 6 February.See \\"Common Worship ‚Äì Festivals\\", Church House Publishing, 2008, page 367, which may be viewed on-line here. Although not a legal requirement, special services are also held in some churches of other denominations. Divine Worship: The Missal provides the following Collect for use at Masses, Mattins, and Evensong in the Catholic Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham: :O GOD, who providest for thy people by thy power, and rulest over them in love: vouchsafe so to bless thy Servant our King (Queen); that under him (her) this nation may be wisely governed, and grant that he (she) being devoted to thee with his (her) whole heart, and persevering in good works unto the end, may, by thy guidance, come to thine everlasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord, who liveth and reigneth with thee, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without end. Amen.  Vatican City  The Vatican counts the Anniversario dell'Elezione del Santo Padre, or the anniversary of the election of the reigning pontiff, among its statutory public holidays. Since 2014, the city-state has observed this holiday on 13 March, the anniversary of Pope Francis' election in 2013.

They ruled during the 10th and early 11th centuries. Early history The origin of the Muhtajids is unknown; the name has been given by modern historians after their presumed forebear Muhtaj ( Mu·∏•tƒÅj).Edward J. Keall, Margaret A. Leveque, and Nancy Willson, \\"Qal'eh-i Yazdigird: Its Architectural Decorations,\\" Iran: Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies (1980): 1-43, p. 3. They may have been descended from the ChaghƒÅn KhudƒÅs who ruled Chaghaniyan during the early Middle Ages; another possibility is that their ancestors were Arabs who migrated to the region and were Iranicized.Clifford Edmund Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties (Columbia University Press, 1996: ), p. 177. In any case, by the early 10th century Chaghaniyan had become a vassal to the Samanids of Bukhara. Abu Bakr Muhammad The first ruler fully attested to by the sources was Abu Bakr Muhammad b. Muzaffar b. Muhtaj. Under the Samanids he was the governor of Ferghana. When in 929 the Samanid amir Nasr b. Ahmad was temporarily expelled from power by his brothers, Muhammad remained loyal to him. As a result, when Nasr managed to restore himself he rewarded Muhammad with the governorship of Balkh, and then in 933 made him governor of Khurasan. During his time as governor of Khurasan, Muhammad battled various Dailamite bands in northern Iran. In 939 he fell ill and was removed from his post; he died in 941. Abu 'Ali Chaghani Abu 'Ali Ahmad Chaghani was the most prominent of the Muhtajid rulers. He succeeded his father in his posts in 939 and earnestly fought to maintain a Samanid presence in northern Iran, attempting to stem there the rise of the Buyids, Dailamite officers who had already taken over southwest Iran. He fell out of favor with the Samanid amir Nuh b. Nasr and was removed from the governorship of Khurasan. Refusing to accept this, he revolted and installed in Bukhara another Samanid, but eventually Nuh retook Bukhara. Despite this, he was unable to defeat Abu 'Ali, and in the end he allowed him to retain his rule of Chaghaniyan. In 952 Abu 'Ali was made governor of Khurasan a second time, but only a year later was again dismissed. He fled to the Buyids and died in 955. Later history The Muhtajid rulers succeeding Abu 'Ali are not well recorded. Abu'l Muzaffar (b.?) Muhammad was the ruler of Chaghaniyan toward the end of the 10th century. He was an ally of the Turkish general Fa'iq and together they fought against Abu'l Muzaffar's relative, Abu'l-Hasan Taher b. Fazl b. Muhammad, who had either been the previous ruler of Chaghaniyan or had usurped power there. Taher's army marched to Balkh in 991 but in the ensuing battle he was killed and Abu'l Muzaffar Muhammad established himself in Chaghaniyan. The alliance with Fa'iq meant that he was also an enemy of the Simjuris; he therefore took part in the conflicts that marked the end of the Samanids as a power (see Nuh II of Samanid for details). By the end of the century the Muhtajid rulers became vassals of the Ghaznavids, who had supplanted the Samanids in Afghanistan and Khurasan. In 1025 an unnamed Chaghani ruler and other Ghaznavid vassals joined Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna when he crossed the Oxus River to meet his ally, the Karakhanid ruler of Kashgar Qadir-khan Yusuf. During the reign of Mahmud's successor Mas'ud, the governor of Chaghaniyan was described as a son-in-law of Mas'ud's named Abu'l-Qasem, who may have been a Muhtajid. Abu'l-Qasem temporarily had to flee from the province in the face of an invasion by the Transoxianan Karakhanids. No more rulers of Chaghaniyan are mentioned after this, and only a few years later the Seljuks took control of the region.

According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had an estimated population of 198 in 2000. Geography Zephyr is located at (31.6759884, -98.7947697). It is situated along U.S. Highway 84 in southeastern Brown County, about 12 miles east of Brownwood and 54 miles southwest of Stephenville. History The community was initially located on the banks of Blanket Creek in 1850. The name Zephyr, meaning soft, gentle wind, was first used by land surveyors who were trapped in the area during a blue norther. In 1863, the Lazarus Vann family arrived in the vicinity. They were joined by other families over the next few years. A school was founded in 1876. Zephyr's first store opened in 1878 and a post office was established the following year. In 1885, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway completed a line from Brownwood to Lampasas that missed Zephyr by roughly a mile. Store owner J.M. Wilson moved his store and the post office one mile west of the community's initial location to its present site. The community later became a station on the railroad. On May 30, 1909, an F4 tornado struck Zephyr, killing 34 people and injuring 70. Most of the deaths occurred in residential areas on the southern and eastern sides of the community. To date, the Zephyr tornado remains one of the deadliest tornadoes in the state's history. The community rebuilt and experienced a long period of growth. By 1940, the population stood around 750. A new high school was constructed that same year. Zephyr's economy was dependent on cotton, but a boll weevil infestation and deteriorating market conditions caused the community's last gin to close in the early 1940s. The population had fallen below 300 during the 1960s and remained at that level into the 1970s. During the final decades of the 20th century, Zephyr was home to around 198 people. That figure remained constant through 2000. Although it is unincorporated, Zephyr has a post office with the zip code of 76890.Zip Code Lookup Education Public education in the community of Zephyr is provided by the Zephyr Independent School District.
