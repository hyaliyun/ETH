The state highway runs from U.S. Route 15 (US 15) in Point of Rocks east to MD 182 in Norwood. The western portion of MD 28 is a rural highway connecting several villages in southern Frederick County and western Montgomery County. By contrast, the eastern portion of the state highway is a major east-west commuter route, particularly within Gaithersburg and Rockville. MD 28 was an original 1927 Maryland state highway. The state highway originally extended north and east through Olney to Ashton, but the highway was rolled back to Norbeck in the 1940s. MD 28 was extended east to its present eastern terminus in the early 1980s. The original western terminus was in Tuscarora, but the state highway was extended to Point of Rocks around 1970. In addition to being expanded to a multi-lane divided highway in central Montgomery County beginning in the 1970s, MD 28 was relocated in downtown Rockville in the 1940s, in eastern Rockville in the 1970s, and in western Rockville in the 1990s. Route description MD 28 follows portions of two Maryland Scenic Byways: the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Scenic Byway from its western terminus in Point of Rocks to MD 109 in Beallsville and the Antietam Campaign Scenic Byway from MD 85 near Tuscarora to Mount Ephraim Road at Dickerson. The highway is also part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 112 in Darnestown to MD 182 in Norwood. Point of Rocks to Darnestown MD 28 begins at an intersection with US 15 (Catoctin Mountain Highway) in Point of Rocks, just north of the Point of Rocks Bridge across the Potomac River. The state highway heads east as two-lane undivided Clay Street, which parallels CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision rail line and the linear Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park through town. MD 28 passes the Point of Rocks station of MARC's Brunswick Line where the Metropolitan Subdivision and the Old Main Line Subdivision meet at a wye. The state highway parallels and then crosses at grade to the south side of the Old Main Line Subdivision at the east end of town. MD 28 continues east as Tuscarora Road, which crosses Washington Run and Tuscarora Creek. The highway passes through the hamlet of Tuscarora before reaching a three-way intersection with MD 85, which heads north as Buckeystown Pike. MD 28 turns southeast onto Dickerson Road. View east along MD 28 east of Point of Rocks MD 28 heads southeast and crosses the Monocacy River at Furnace Ford shortly before entering Montgomery County. After intersecting Mouth of Monocacy Road, which heads west to the Monocacy Aqueduct, the state highway enters Dickerson, where the road meets Mt. Ephraim Road, which serves MARC's Dickerson station and continues northeast toward Sugarloaf Mountain. Immediately after Mt. Ephraim Road, MD 28 turns south and passes through a narrow underpass of the Metropolitan Subdivision rail line. MD 28 crosses the Little Monocacy River before the intersection with Martinsburg Road, which heads southwest toward the Dickerson Generating Station and White's Ferry. Intersection of MD 28 and Mt. Ephraim Road next to the underpass of CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision in DickersonMD 28 continues southeast as Darnestown Road toward Beallsville, where the highway intersects MD 109 (Beallsville Road), which serves Poolesville to the south. The highway passes the Darby Store at the latter intersection, then continues past the Hanover Farm House at Four Streams Golf Club and crosses Dry Seneca Creek. After an oblique intersection with MD 117 (Bucklodge Road) at Lees Corner, the state highway enters Dawsonville, where it intersects White Grounds Road, which heads north past the Susanna Farm, and meets the eastern end of MD 107 (Whites Ferry Road), which serves Poolesville and leads to White's Ferry. MD 28 crosses Seneca Creek and passes Seneca Creek State Park before entering Darnestown. Within Darnestown, the state highway intersects MD 118 (Germantown Road) and MD 112 (Seneca Road). East of MD 112, MD 28 curves northeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway before passing Quince Orchard High School and intersecting MD 124 (Quince Orchard Road) at the southwest corner of the city of Gaithersburg. Gaithersburg to Norwood MD 28 continues southeast along the southern edge of Gaithersburg and passes by the new urbanist development Kentlands. The highway crosses Muddy Branch parallel to a pair of spurs on the south designated MD 899 (American Way). After the state highway expands to six lanes and intersects Muddy Branch Road, the old alignment of MD 28, Darnestown Road, splits to the east and MD 28 veers northeast as Key West Avenue. The state highway intersects MD 119 (Great Seneca Highway); passes to the north of the Montgomery County campus of Johns Hopkins University, the Universities at Shady Grove, and Shady Grove Adventist Hospital, and enters the city of Rockville at its intersection with Shady Grove Road, where the highway's name changes to Montgomery Avenue. MD 28 curves south through the western part of Rockville and meets the western end of Gude Drive, which provides a bypass of downtown Rockville, and the eastern end of Darnestown Road. The highway curves east again and crosses Watts Branch within its seven-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway). MD 28 eastbound in RockvilleMD 28 continues through the West Montgomery Avenue Historic District as a two-lane road with center turn lane. At Great Falls Road, near the Beall-Dawson House, the state highway veers southeast onto four-lane Jefferson Street through the Montgomery County Courthouse Historic District along the southern edge of downtown Rockville. MD 28 becomes a divided highway and its name changes to Veirs Mill Road at Monroe Street shortly before its oblique intersection with MD 355 (Rockville Pike) to the north of Richard Montgomery High School. Access from eastbound MD 28 to northbound MD 355 is provided via Monroe Street; the movement from westbound MD 28 to southbound MD 355 can be made via MD 660 (Dodge Street). After MD 28 crosses the Metropolitan Subdivision rail line and the Red Line of the Washington Metro, ramps to Stonestreet Avenue join eastbound and leave westbound to provide access to the Rockville station serving Metro, MARC, and Amtrak trains. East of the Stonestreet ramps, the state highway has a four-way intersection with MD 586 (Veirs Mill Road) and MD 911 (First Street); the latter route provides another connection between MD 355 and both MD 28 and MD 586. MD 28 continues north along four-lane divided First Street. North of Baltimore Road, First Street continues straight while the state highway veers to the northeast as Norbeck Road. MD 28 intersects the eastern end of Gude Drive, leaves the city of Rockville at its crossing of Rock Creek, and meets the other end of Baltimore Road. The state highway continues east, flanked along most of the way by service roads, many of which are part of MD 655 (Old MD 28). After intersecting MD 115 (Muncaster Mill Road), MD 28 meets MD 97 (Georgia Avenue) in the unincorporated community of Norbeck. The highway heads southeast of a park and ride lot that is accessed from MD 928 before it reduces to a two-lane road and runs along the northern edge of Leisure World. The state highway crosses over MD 200 (Intercounty Connector) with no access immediately to the west of Wintergate Drive, where it crosses the ICC Trail. After crossing Batchellors Run, MD 28 expands to a four-lane divided highway for its terminating intersection with MD 182 (Layhill Road) near Norwood. Norbeck Road continues east as a county- maintained highway toward the intersection of MD 650 and MD 198 near Spencerville. History MD 28 is one of the original Maryland state-numbered highways assigned in 1927. The highway's original western terminus was at Tuscarora, from which US 15 headed west toward Point of Rocks and north toward Frederick. MD 28 was extended west to Point of Rocks when US 15 was moved to its present course between Point of Rocks and Frederick in 1970. The state highway's original eastern terminus was at the original MD 27 in Ashton. MD 27 later became US 29; today, this is the intersection of MD 108 and MD 650. MD 28 followed MD 97 from Norbeck north to Olney, then used what is now MD 108 from Olney east to Ashton. MD 28 was truncated to Norbeck by 1946. The highway was extended from Norbeck to its present eastern terminus near Norwood, replacing what had been MD 609, in 1981. MD 28 westbound near the village of Tuscarora MD 28 originally followed Baltimore Road between downtown Rockville and east of Rock Creek. Between 1940 and 1944, MD 28 was placed on a new grade-separated crossing of the Metropolitan Branch along Veirs Mill Road, then north on First Street to Baltimore Road. MD 28 was rolled back from Ashton to Norbeck between 1944 and 1946. In 1969 or 1970, the controlled access portion of US 15 north of Point of Rocks was completed. As a result, MD 85 was assigned to the old route of US 15 north of Tuscarora and MD 28 was extended west to its current terminus in Point of Rocks. Also in 1970, the bypass of Baltimore Road in eastern Rockville was under construction. In 1981, MD 28 was made a divided highway between downtown Rockville and Baltimore Avenue west of Rock Creek. In 1982, the divided highway was extended from Baltimore Avenue east of Rock Creek to MD 97. In the mid 1990s, Key West Avenue in the western part of Rockville was completed and expanded to a six- lane divided highway. MD 28 was moved to the improved highway to bypass the parallel stretch of Darnestown Road by 1999. Between 2002 and 2004, MD 28 was widened to a four- to six-lane divided highway between MD 124 and the west end of Key West Avenue. In 2002, Norbeck Road was completed between the eastern terminus of MD 28 and the MD 650-MD 198 intersection.

It was formerly found in forests in Northeastern Brazil in what is now the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas, which is the origin of its common name (Harry 2006). It is now extinct in the wild; there are about 130 individuals in captivity. German naturalist Georg Marcgrave first identified the Alagoas curassow in 1648 in its native range. Subsequently, the origin and legitimacy of the bird began to be questioned due to the lack of specimens. An adult female curassow was rediscovered in 1951, in the coastal forests of Alagoas. The Mitu mitu was then accepted as a separate species (Silveira). At that time fewer than 60 birds were left in the wild, in the forests around S√£o Miguel dos Campos. Several authors in the 1970s brought to light the growing destruction of its habitat and the rarity of the species. Even with these concerns, the last large forest remnants which contained native Mitu mitu were demolished for sugarcane agriculture. Description The Alagoas curassow measures approximately in length. Feathers covering its body are black and glossy, with a blue-purple hue (BirdLife International 2013). Specimens of Mitu mitu also has a large, bright red beak, flattened at its sides, with a white tip. The same red coloration found on its legs and feet. The tips of its tail feathers are light brown in color, with chestnut colored feathers under the tail. It has a unique grey colored, crescent-shaped patch of bare skin covering its ears, a character not found in other curassows (Harry 2006). The distinct coloration separates M.mitu as its own species distinct from other curassow species. Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced: females tend to be lighter in color and slightly smaller in size (Sick 1980). The birds can live to more than twenty four years in captivity (The Website of Everything 2010). Video recording in captivity show that this cracid sporadically makes a high-pitched chirping sound (Bonaf√© 2003). Population Since 1977, the entire Mitu mitu population has been in captivity. The population numbered 44 in 2000, and by 2008, there were 130 birds in two aviaries. About 35% of the birds were hybrids with M. tuberosum (BirdLife International 2012). Habitat and ecology Mitu mitu native habitat is subtropical/tropical moist lowland primary forest, where it was known to consume fruit of Phyllanthus, Eugenia and \\"mangabeira.\\" It is extinct and extirpated in its native range in Alagoas and Pernambuco states, Northeastern Brazil (BirdLife International 2012). Breeding habits Due to their absence in the wild and lack of study previously conducted on these cracids before their extinction in the wild, not much is known about their breeding habits outside of captivity. Alagoas curassow females begin reproducing at about 2 years old. In captivity, they produce about 2-3 eggs each year (Harry 2006). There has been a greater genetic variability amongst the Alagoas curassow after 1990, when hybrid breeding programs were introduced; Alagoas curassows were bred with closely related razor-billed curassows (BirdLife International 2013). Taxonomy The Alagoas curassow was first mentioned by German naturalist Georg Marcgrave in his work Historia Naturalis Brasiliae which was published in 1648. Because of the lack of information and specimens, it was considered conspecific with the common razor-billed curassow, until its rediscovery in 1951 in the Alagoas lowland forests, Brazil. Following the review of Pereira & Baker (2004), they are today believed to be a fairly basal lineage of its genus, related to the crestless curassow, the other Mitu species with brown eumelanin in the tail tip. Its lineage has been distinct since the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (approximately 5 million years ago), when it became isolated in refugia in the Atlantic Forest (Pereira & Baker 2004). Conservation efforts As this species is extinct in the wild, the total population of 130 birds only persists in two separate captive populations. A reintroduction plan is being organized, though it faces challenges. Even if the population could be bred to healthy numbers, the species would need to be reintroduced into a large natural geographical area. Human expansion and overpopulation has caused nearly all of the Alagoas curassow's natural habitat to be destroyed. One potential reintroduction site has been proposed. Precautions would have to be taken in order to prevent illegal hunting of the species after reintroduction. Status The Alagoas curassow became extinct in the wild due to deforestation and hunting. The last wild Alagoas curassow was seen and killed in 1984, or possibly 1987 or 1988. The captive population has been extensively hybridized with the razor-billed curassow,Another case of successful interbreeding between quite distant species, as is often found in cracids. See for example Crax species. and there are several dozen purebred birds left. These are being maintained and bred in two privately owned professional aviaries in Brazil mainly due to lack of official interest owing to the long- standing doubt about the taxon's validity. The Alagoas curassow is protected under Brazilian law and is listed on Appendix I of CITES. Diet and interactions The Alagoas curassow is known to consume a diet of fruits and nuts. Although not much information is known about this species' interactions and behavior in the wild, the stomach contents of these birds were found to contain fruits specifically from the castelo tree. It has also been said that they enjoy fruits from the plant Clarisia racemosa. Generally, the female birds weigh less than the males and lay about 2-3 eggs a year. The average lifespan in captivity is about 24 years. The lack of knowledge about their behavior in the wild makes it difficult to know how the birds interact with other species. The impact of their introduction on interactions with other species is difficult to predict. For instance, the Chamek spider monkey also eats Clarisia racemosa, which could lead to competition with the Alagoas curassow. A lack of genetic diversity is another potential concern. Scientists have been controlling the sexual interactions within the species by pairing certain birds together in order to reduce hybridization and maintain the original Alagoas curassow. File:Hofl√∂ssnitz Eckhout 54br.jpg|Illustration from the 1650s Future of the species With the objective to preserve the species and to increase genetic variability in the population, the \\"original\\" stock had their DNA examined by scientists in order to guide future pairings. Once a captive population has been successfully created, they can start being reintroduced back into the wild. The more ideal locations would be large forest remnants, such as those located at Usina Utinga-Le√£o and Usina Serra Grande (Silveira).

The book focuses mainly on maintaining societal order through a system of impartial laws that strictly mete out rewards and punishments for citizens' actions. The first chapters advise promoting agriculture and suppressing other low-priority secondary activities, as well as encouraging martial virtues for use in creating and maintaining a state army for wars of conquest. Textual tradition With some chapters written decades or even more than a century after his death, no critical scholar supposes the text to have been written by Shang Yang, though \\"some chapters were almost certainly penned by Shang Yang himself; others may come from the hand of his immediate disciples and followers.\\" Highly composite, it nonetheless forms a \\"relatively coherent ideological vision\\", likely reflecting the evolution of what Zheng Liangshu (1989) dubbed Shang Yang's 'intellectual current' (xuepai Â≠∏Ê¥æ).Creel,What Is Taoism?, 101 * Pines, Yuri, \\"Legalism in Chinese Philosophy\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N.

The band's live lineup varies quite a bit, largely depending on the location of the show. Caustic's lyrics are typically humorous, while the music itself ranges between older styled industrial and more modern styled powernoise. Caustic has performed live at a number of international industrial music festivals, including the 2005 and 2006 Providence Industrial Festival and the 2006 Blacksun, Reverence, Indoctrination, and the UK's Infest Festival in 2007. Background History Originally the debut album, Unicorns, Kittens, and Shit, was supposed to be released by Static Sky Records in early 2006, but due to production issues surrounding the CD liner notes, the release of the album was pushed back until summer 2006. After Static Sky Records closed, Caustic moved to the Crunch Pod label. The debut album is listed as a co-release between the then defunct Static Sky Records and Crunch Pod. Caustic has enjoyed moderate success in 2006 with the release of Unicorns, Kittens, and Shit, which hit number 1 on Metropolis Records' mail-order site. Caustic's second full-length Booze Up and Riot propelled the project even further, with a follow-up planned for late 2008 on Crunch Pod. In the meantime Caustic has also released several split EPs and CDR releases, as well. Matt Fanale has been in side projects such as m00ntz! (with Eric Oehler (Null Device) and Chuck Spencer (Stochastic Theory)), as well as currently with Parasite Twin (with Brian Schuh), and Prude, with Chemlab's Jared Louche, Cyanotic's Sean Payne, and Plastic Heroes' Marc Plastic. Perhaps one of Caustic's more famous songs is \\"Kill AFI\\" Written in response to post-punk band AFI's song on Decemberunderground \\"Kill Caustic\\". The title of that song, however, had nothing to do with Caustic. In 2010, right before the release of And You Will Know Me By The Trail of Vomit, Fanale publicly declared he gave up drinking, frequently blogging about his experiences with his alcoholism. The song \\"White Knuckle Head Fuck\\" on 2011's The Golden Vagina of Fame and Profit is specifically about his dealing with withdrawal. Genre and style Caustic can largely be described as industrial and/or powernoise, with a more humorous and self-deprecating tone than similar acts: Fanale has claimed Caustic's genre to be \\"Jizzcore,\\" as a joke about the amount of self-indulgent, artist-created subgenres in industrial. Influences Matt Fanale has referenced include Revolting Cocks, Hank III, Pop Will Eat Itself, Chemlab, Atari Teenage Riot, and Stromkern, as well as the comedians Doug Stanhope, Bill Hicks, and Louis CK. Live Live performances are often noted for the often frenetic interaction with the audience and the band's surroundings, characterized by mild drunken belligerence. Forties were often on prominent display. Bizarre costumes and frenetic lightshows are also a staple: Caustic was set to open for 5 dates of the 2006 KMFDM/COMBICHRIST tour, but managed to get kicked off within 24 hours. Of note is Caustic's last performance of 2006 at the Indoctrination Festival in Chicago in which Fanale commandeer the event's video projector to project gay porn onto the band (consisting of Fanale and the Gothsicles). He also taped his microphone to his chin with clear duct tape, festooned the stage with pages from a gay pornographic magazine, sprayed the audience with a douche, had a rubber chicken shoved down his pants as well as taped to his head and arm, and, after assailing the audience with the rubber chicken repeatedly, was handed a bouquet of roses with the chicken taped to it.

Synopsis Illustration by John D. Batten for More English Fairy Tales A little boy was given a little bull-calf by his father. His father died, and his mother remarried. His stepfather was cruel to him and threatened to kill the calf. An old man advised the boy to run away, and he did. He begged for some bread, which he shared with the calf. Later, he begged for some cheese, which he would have shared, but the calf refused. It told the boy it would go into the wild and kill all the creatures it finds, except a dragon, which will kill it. It told the boy to climb a tree, and once it was dead, to skin it and take its bladder, which would make anything it struck drop dead. With it, he was to kill the dragon. It happened as the calf said. Monkeys climbed the tree after him, and the boy squeezed the cheese, claiming it was flint; when they saw the whey, they retreated. The boy set out to find the dragon and kill it. He found a princess who had been staked out for the dragon. He killed it, though it bit off his forefinger. He said he must leave her, but first he cut out the dragon's tongue and the princess gave him a diamond ring. The princess told her father, who asked for him to come, and many gentlemen cut off their forefingers and brought diamond rings and the tongues of all kinds of beasts, but none were the dragon's tongue or the princess's ring. The boy came, but the king turned him away as a beggar, though the princess knew he was like the boy. Somewhat later, he came back, better dressed, and the princess insisted on speaking with him. He produced the ring and the tongue and married the princess. And they lived happily ever after. Motifs Jacobs noted the dragon slaying theme was in common with Perseus and Andromeda myths, and that the trick with the cheese is also common in fairy tales.

Design and development In late 1938, the Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) searched unsuccessfully for a suitable engine for its new \\"safe\\" airplane, the Ercoupe. ERCO hired Harold Morehouse, former engineer in charge of small engine design at Continental Motors, to design a new engine.

The engine performed well, but ERCO discontinued it when Continental introduced the Continental A65 engine in 1940, which generated comparable horsepower at half the cost.

Heritage and early life in Switzerland He was born Felice Adolfo M√ºller on 29 March 1862 at Airolo, Switzerland, to a prominent patrician family that by the 18th and 19th centuries included mercenaries, lawyers, hoteliers and businessmen. Adolfo was the sixth of nineteen children, most of whom survived infancy, born to Roman Catholic parents: Carl Alois M√ºller (1825‚Äì1887), a lawyer, was Gerichtspr√§sident (Presiding Judge) of the Cantonal Courts, and Genovefa (n√©e Lombardi; 1836‚Äì1920), daughter of Felice Lombardi, Director of the Hospice on the St Gotthard Pass, which he took over from the Capuchin monks who had run it for centuries. The family spoke Airolese mainly, a local dialect of Ticinese Italian, as well as Swiss-German. Training in Switzerland, Munich, Rome and Paris After attending the municipal drawing school in the Ticino, and school in Sarnen he was encouraged by the sculptor Vincenzo Vela (1820‚Äì1891) and possibly the Commendatore Metalli-Stresa (a family friend), to study oil painting under the local painter of religious pictures in a Nazarene-style, Melchior Paul von Deschwanden in Stans in Switzerland (who died in Adolfo's arms in February 1881). On April 25, 1881, he entered the Munich Academy where he stayed 18 months, studying with Professors Alexander Str√§huber (1814‚Äì82), Alois Gabl (1845‚Äì93), Gyula Benczur (1844‚Äì1920), and possibly Karl von Piloty; on the same day, a fellow Swiss called Adalbert Baggenstos (1863‚Äì97), who originated from Stans, also registered at the Munich Academy. Between Munich and Paris he spent nearly two years (1882‚Äì84) in Rome, studying and copying Old Masters, apparently at the instigation of the distinguished Ticinese-born artist Antonio Ciseri (1821-1891), and where he apparently painted portraits of Cardinals Joseph Hergenr√∂ther and Gustav Adolf Hohenlohe who were acquaintances of his uncle Josef, a Domherr in Chur, Switzerland. His known early work is necessarily varied, and includes pictures in the style of Deschwanden (usually signed M√ºller, Adolfo), academic drawings executed in Munich (usually signed Ad. M√ºller), copies of Old Masters, and early independent oils, sometimes was influenced by artist's like Robert Z√ºnd (1827‚Äì1909) and Frank Buchser (1828‚Äì1890) which includes landscapes, genre and religious pictures. Many of these survive in the ancestral home of the M√ºllers in Hospental, Switzerland, and with surviving members of his family in the St Gotthard and elsewhere. Early career Saidee Williams Overton (Sarah Gladys Cheeney Williams) Whilst in Paris in late 1884 he decided to visit America. He arrived first in Milwaukee, and then visited Chicago and St Paul, Minnesota, where he had relatives. In 1885 he went to Baltimore to paint James Cardinal Gibbons for the first time and in 1886 completed a full-length portrait which was given to the Cardinal for his residence after being exhibited at Schaus's Gallery in New York (missing). At around this time he was travelling all over the eastern United States painting and executed a very large canvas of the Bushkill Falls in Pennsylvania (Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal, Germany). Luckily for the artist, his talent for portraiture was soon noticed by the St. Paul railroad builder James J. Hill, who was to commission or acquire many pictures of himself, his family, his friends and business associates, like the Canadian missionary Father Albert Lacombe in 1895, and John Stewart Kennedy the financier in 1901. In the Newark Museum, New Jersey, is a portrait of a little girl dressed in pink called Miss Brandeis which is probably his first commissioned picture made in America (it is signed with a variation of his family name, A. Lombardi-Muller), though a portrait of Father Joseph Fransioli, who was minister to the large influx of Italian-speaking immigrants arriving in New York, today at the Brooklyn Historical Society, was possibly completed before this as it is signed Adolph Muller. It would seem that from quite early on he wanted to sign his works in a way that was unique to him, and so portraits between 1886 and 1889 are sometimes signed F. Adolphus Muller, A. Muller-Uri, or Muller d'Uri. By 1890 this was fully anglicized as A. Muller-Ury, the umlaut in his surname being dropped. Some of his later smaller works are signed A M Ury. (As late as 1932, the Swiss-American Historical Society published a book on Swiss-Americans where his name was inaccurately stated as Adolph Felix Muller-Uri.) In 1889 he painted a portrait of John R. Brady a New York Judge which was apparently presented to the American Bar Association. He may have travelled in North Africa in the summer of 1889 after visiting the Exposition Universelle as he dated a Portrait of a North African man with a Gun (previously known as Portrait of an Arab; Private Collection, London) that year and exhibited a picture called In the Dark Continent at the National Academy of Design in New York at the end of that year (No. 105; lost). In 1890 he completed a second bust-length portrait of Father Joseph Fransioli of Brooklyn (lost). His New York studio 1885-1904 was in the Sherwood Studio Building, 58 West 57th Street and 6th Avenue (the building has been long demolished), where he is noted before 1889 in Room C; by 1894 he had a studio with a waiting room (both lit by windows) and a bedroom. Other artists who rented studios in the building in the 1880s were his friend from Munich, Jan Che≈Çmi≈Ñski (who later married the sister of art dealer Roland Knoedler), landscape painter Robert W. Van Boskerck, James Carroll Beckwith, painter and muralist Edwin Howland Blashfield, and painter turned critic Arthur Hoeber, and later artists such as Carle Blenner and portraitist George Burroughs Torrey.John Davis, Our United Happy Family: 'Artists in the Sherwood Studio Building 1880-1900', Archives of American Art Journal, Vol. 36, No. 3/4, (1996) pp.2-19. He was photographed in his Sherwood studio by artist turned photographer Edwin Scott Bennett (1847-1915) which was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Society of Amateur Photographers of New York in 1894.An artist turned photographer of artists: Edwin Scott Bennett (1847-1915) is the subject of a forthcoming article by Dr Carole Lowrey. For a number of years he commuted between New York and Europe. In 1892, after the great success of his portraits of Senator Chauncey Depew in 1890 (Yale Club of New York City) and Mrs Theodore Havemeyer in 1891 (now the property of the Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island), he applied for United States citizenship. It was apparently at this date that he met the young art dealer Joseph Duveen, who was to become a close friend, and after 1891 that he began to be dubbed 'Painter to the Four Hundred', referring the √©lite of New York society in whose circles he socialized. He was much aided by the Havemeyers, and also by Louis Benziger (1840-1896), a Roman Catholic publisher (Benziger Brothers), who persuaded many New Yorkers to sit to him; he remained friendly with his son Bruno Benziger until his death, and indeed Bruno Benziger organized the artist's burial.Benziger was one of the executors of the artist's Will, the other being the Swiss Consul-General in New York, but Benziger's name is on the receipt for the burial plot in Calvary Cemetery (Muller Family Papers). For three years in the late 1890s he leased one of the studios in Pembroke Studios in Kensington, London,The Royal Blue Book: Fashionable Directory and Parliamentary Guide, London 1899, p. 1108, says Muller-Ury occupied No. 9. This had formerly been the studio of Pre-Raphaelite painter Herbert Draper. where he certainly painted portraits of Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, and Lord Mount Stephen who were business associates of James J. Hill, of whom he made an etching in London in 1898 which was distributed to Hill's family and colleagues. According to a letter he wrote to Hill he started the portrait of Consuelo Yznaga, the 8th Duchess of Manchester, in London in 1898, but it is not known if it was ever completed. In 1903 he was one of a group of artists who invested in a new studio building, the Atelier Building, 33 West 67th Street. Muller-Ury lived in the top floor right studio, and incorporated a stained glass panel of the M√ºller coat-of-arms into the window (removed in 1947 and now at the Haus M√ºller in Hospental, Switzerland). The floors were all inlaid with borders of intarsia, and the smaller windows given mullions. He moved into the studio in 1904 and remained there until 1947.'Some Interesting Studio Apartments in the Atelier Building', Architectural Record, No. 21, (May 1907) pp. 385‚Äì88.

Wiltse, who raised the U.S. flag on Honolulu in January 1893 Painter of roses and still lifes Still Life With Chinese Vase And Pink Roses In 1896 A Boston newspaper reported that, ‚Äò... Mr. M√ºller-Ury, the portrait painter, who has just returned from abroad, has taken an attractive studio in Everett street, Newport, the one occupied by Mr. Harper Pennington last season. Mr. M√ºller-Ury‚Äôs roses as well as his portraits are admired, and he is painting a huge basket of American Beauties for the Havemeyer villa.‚ÄôBudget, Boston, August 2, 1896. In a surviving photograph of the artist‚Äôs studio in the Sherwood taken in 1894 (a portrait of Monsignor Satolli is on the easel next to it) there is huge still life, and in a letter from his studio to James J. Hill dated 12 August 1895 (Hill Papers, St. Paul, MN) he says that he hopes that the 'flower peace [sic]' he sent to him 'will suit for the place intended for', further evidence that he had painted some still lifes before 1896. After 1918 the style of his still lifes becomes more impressionistic, the technique more painterly and using a great deal of impasto, and usually depict roses in Chinese vases from the former collection of J. Pierpont Morgan that he copied at the galleries of Duveen Brothers in New York (Duveen's exhibited the Morgan collection in 1919) and elsewhere, and sometimes including depictions of other works of art like bronze or biscuit porcelain statuettes, Chinese porcelain Buddhas, Italian maiolica plates and so on. It is known he was an admirer of Claude Monet and others, as he told the German Kaiser ‚Äì who hated the Impressionists ‚Äì in 1909 that the Impressionists had \\"done a great deal to awaken modern art.\\"New York American, November 28, 1909, Part II Main Sheet, p. 1. The roses were claimed by the soprano Jessica Dragonette in her autobiography to be the varieties American Beauty (red), La France (pink), Belle of Portugal (pale pink), Claudius, Killarney (rose pink), and Boucher-Piern√©, but there were others. Many of his impressionistic rose paintings were created after he moved to California. Californian sojourn President William McKinley In March 1922 he travelled with Sir Joseph Duveen (later Lord Duveen) to California for the first time, in order that Duveen could deliver to bibliophile and art collector Henry E. Huntington Gainsborough's famous picture The Blue Boy which Huntington had bought the previous year. Duveen had promised the artist that Huntington would commission a portrait of himself. He did not.Edward Fowles, Memories of Duveen Brothers: Seventy years in the art world (London, 1976), p. 148. M√ºller-Ury liked California and after painting Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna in San Francisco in 1923 decided the following year to erect a studio near Huntington's estate. The studio he built was at the corner of Monterey and Shenandoah Roads in San Marino (architect Carleton Winslow), in the fashionable Spanish style with a green tiled roof and in the studio an enormous north-facing window. He placed the Muller coat-of-arms on the east frontage, where it may be found today. The gardens were extensively planted with many varieties of roses including Radiance, Columbia, Rose Marie, Irish Charm, Imperial Potentate and American Beauty which he painted into his canvases depicting the Morgan porcelains begun in New York. Duveen built a bungalow next door to the artist on Shenandoah Road, but seems to have quickly sold it after the death of his client Henry E. Huntington in 1927. It was in San Marino during the following years, that Muller-Ury executed portraits of the following sitters: * Mary Brockway Metcalf, Huntington's granddaughter * Henry Mauris Robinson, the diplomat * Anita Baldwin (daughter of Lucky Baldwin of Arcadia, full-length, today at the Los Angeles County Arboretum & Botanic Garden) * Maurice DeMond, founder of the Breakfast Club then in Griffith Park * Mrs Carrie Ada Lawless, wife of William J. Lawless, the Mayor of Sierra Madre 1928-1929 (today at the Sierre Madre Women's Club) * President Rufus B. von KleinSmid (1931) of the University of Southern California (three-quarter length; deaccessioned by the university in the 1980s). In 1926, M√ºller-Ury seems to have begun from a photograph a portrait of Henry E. Huntington standing (now at the Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena) and a seated one (which was engraved by Witherspoon) as well as another smaller seated version which was acquired by John and Elizabeth Huntington Metcalf; his portrait of their daughter Mary Brockway Metcalf was for some years hanging in the lobby to the office of the Director of the Huntington Library. In 1930, M√ºller-Ury painted the former Miss Gladys Quarr√© of San Francisco (then Mrs Frederick Peabody of Montecito, Santa Barbara); later she became known as Gladys Quarr√© Knapp, a socialite and friend of many Hollywood actors. He also painted a large allegorical work entitled The Spirit of California a version of which was acquired by a prominent art collector called Fred Elbridge Keeler (lost). M√ºller-Ury abandoned the studio for the last time on September 3, 1933, after which it was let to friends. The house was apparently used by the Red Cross during the Second World War. He sold it in January 1947 for about half its value because nobody was prepared at that time to buy a property where most rooms were comparatively small except for the enormous studio. Last years After his return from California he settled permanently back in his New York studio. In 1936 he travelled to Europe and he may have done so in 1937 and certainly in 1938 when he painted a large portrait of President Motta of Switzerland, for his home town of Bellinzona (Archivio Cantonale). In 1937 he painted a portrait of Ellen Dunlap Hopkins, founder of the New York School of Applied Design for Women which he presented to the School in 1938 (Private collection, Brooklyn). He painted Pope Pius XII in 1936 during his visit to the United States when still Cardinal Pacelli, only finishing the work in 1939 (by painting in the white robes after his election to the pontificate), and painted his friend Cardinal Francis Spellman of New York twice in 1940 (St Joseph's Seminary, Yonkers) one version being presented by Manhattan College to Fordham University in 1941 (who appear to have lost the work),New York Times, Sunday, February 23, 1941 (reproduced). and again in 1942; he also painted Archbishop Joseph Rummell of New Orleans (1943). In 1940, he painted the then famous radio soprano Jessica Dragonette (Georgian Court College, New Jersey) and several times thereafter, his last portrait in 1946 depicting her bust-length in a gold fez. In 1941 he produced a portrait of her sister Rosalinda (always called Nadea) Loftus looking over her shoulder. He also painted Dragonette's colleague Fred Mitchell, and several portraits of her friends and acquaintances. In 1942, at age 80, he painted a three quarter length seated portrait of Mrs George H. Ingalls (n√©e Katharine Davis Hinkle), whose late husband, a descendant of one of the founder families of America who had left Lincolnshire in 1628, had been a Vice-President of the New York Central Railroad. Death M√ºller-Ury died, apparently of cancer, on July 6, 1947, at the Lenox Hill Hospital, New York and is buried in New Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York, where his gravestone is marked simply, if incorrectly, 'ADOLPH MULLER-URY 1862-1947'.The grave is located at Section 10, Plot 445, Grave No. 8. On Thursday, July 10, 1947, a Requiem Mass was held for the artist in St. Patrick's Cathedral. After his death his youngest brother Otto M√ºller travelled to New York to settle his estate. Most of his studio contents, and a good many of his pictures, were sold in two sales at the Plaza Art Galleries, 28 and 29 November 1947 (No. 2809) and 5 December 1947 (No. 2813), including his oil sketch of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the portrait of Lina Cavalieri. The Frick Art Reference Library, New York, has a copy of both catalogues, where the prices for his pictures are marked; three extra lots were included in the second sale.

Collections The largest public collections of his works are: The Historisches Museum von Uri, Altdorf, Switzerland which has ten pictures, including a large allegorical work painted in 1888 called Alpenrose und Edelweiss, and portraits of his father and his uncle (all three donated by him in 1905 when the Museum was first opened). The Preservation Society of Newport County, Rhode Island, who were given six of the portraits and two etchings by Muller-Ury in the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie in 2007 to add to the six they already possessed five of which are of the Havemeyer family (this collection included Governor Merriam of St Paul as well as his etchings of railroad builder James J. Hill and Senator Chauncey Depew and was donated to Wyoming by Nicholas M. Turner, husband of the soprano Jessica Dragonette, who at one time owned nearly forty pictures by the artist many bought at his studio sale in 1947).: 'His books, furniture, pictures, brocades and velvets with which he covered his portraits were carelessly thrown about. Dealers only interested in the handsome frames denuded the pictures. I bought whatever I could in friendship and admiration of the master.' They also acquired from Wyoming the artist's hands modelled by Gertrude Colburn (died 1968). The National Portrait Gallery in Washington has nine portraits, including President William McKinley, General Henry Clarke Corbin, James J. Hill, the two etchings of James J. Hill and Chauncey Depew, and two oils that the American Heritage Center at the University of Wyoming in Laramie gave them in 2007 from the Dragonette Collection: a Self-portrait and a portrait of steel titan Charles M. Schwab. In 2009 they acquired a drawing of Anaconda Copper Mining Millionaire Marcus Daly. The New York State Museum at Albany contains six portraits, five of which were in the former New York Chamber of Commerce: Theodore Havemeyer, Oswald Ottendorfer, James Constable, William 'Boyce' Thompson, and Benjamin Altman. Much of his work remains in private collections or with the descendants of his sitters, and many of the portraits of his most famous sitters are apparently lost. However, his recently rediscovered 1923 portrait of his great friend Sir Joseph Duveen, the art dealer, has been recently widely reproduced, notably on the cover of the 2004 biography of Duveen by Meryle Secrest; it was subsequently sold at TEFAF Maastricht in 2006 for $95,000.See: Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts, Portraits and Other Recent Acquisitions (2006) pp.29-30, notice by Stephen Conrad. Hildegarde Muller-Uri Hildegarde Muller-Uri (born 1894, Greenwich Village, New York City ‚Äì died 1990) ‚Äì actually born Hildegarde Petronella Bernhardina Muller ‚Äì an American visual artist, was a relative, and in fact a third cousin, of M√ºller-Ury. She was the eldest daughter of amateur artist Henry Muller and his wife Wihelmina, both of whom were of course natives of Canton Uri in Switzerland.The most complete account of Hildegarde Muller-Uri's life and contribution is given in . Henry Muller had moved from New York to San Augustine in around 1898 to work as a chef in one of Henry Flagler's hotels, and later became to builder and owner of the Hotel Marion at 128 Bay Street.See entry in Clark S. Marlor, The Society of Independent Artists, The Exhibition Record 1917-1944, 1984, p. 406 where she is listed as resident at the Hotel in 1929 She studied first with Hugh H. Breckinridge (1870-1937) at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and at the Breckenridge Art School in East Gloucester, Massachusetts, between 1925 and 1930, and later at the Art Students League with Frank Vincent Dumond (1865-1951) and possibly with Olinsky, Lewis, and others., points out that precise source information available on her early training is actually confused. She exhibited at the Society of Independent Artists 1929 to 1931.Marlor, loc. cit., states she exhibited 'Still Life' in 1929 (No. 518a), and in 1931 two paintings without titles (Nos. 691 and 692). She founded and directed the Galleon Art School in San Augustine in 1925, but this was more a club for artists than a school, so by 1931 she founded the San Augustine Arts Club, where she proved herself a capable arts administrator; she was producing much art of her own in these years and by May 1933 she was able to exhibit a large number of her impressionist paintings, woodcuts of San Augustine, and etchings, at the Woman's Club of Charlotte, North Carolina, in May 1933. By 1937 she had become interested in portraiture and studied again with Wayman Adams (1883-1959) and at some point with his teacher Jossey Bilan. She served as president of the San Augustine Art Association in 1947-1948, and was to be president and treasurer of the Florida Association of Art. Her parents were major patrons of the Arts Club and, in fact, assisted the club by selling them land they owned bordering Marine, Charlotte and Cadiz Streets at a below-market price. They then loaned the Arts Club the money to erect a building, essentially designed by Hildegarde Muller-Uri and her father, which was completed in 1954.A photograph of the model for the Arts Center they designed is reproduced on p. 34 (fig. 19) of . Muller-Uri's work includes stained glass, etchings, illustrations, woodblock prints and linoleum cuts of city scenes and historic buildings in Florida. In 1955 she was working on a book with twenty-two woodcuts called St. Augustine in Woodcuts. She died in 1990 and was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Several of her works have been sold at auction, including St. Augustine Street Scene depicting a Black Woman Outside a St. Augustine House (sold 2013).Hildegarde Muller-Uri brief description, mutualart.com; accessed March 23, 2015.

If the player hits the ground, they will be stunned temporarily rather than exploding as is common in most flying games. In addition to flying a single plane, players are also able to fly a squadron of planes, which are controlled simultaneously, in many formations. Challenges include balloon popping, fire fighting, and cargo delivery. The game also includes multi player mini game elements. Development According to Hudson Soft, development on Wing Island was inspired by Nintendo's flight simulator Pilotwings, as the two share some distinct similarities. Reception The game has received very poor reviews, with most on-line and magazine based reviewers giving the game under half marks. The game sold only 800 copies on December 2, 2006, the day of the Wii launch in Japan.

Decades of research have demonstrated that both genetic and environmental factors play a role in a variety of behaviors in humans and animals (e.g. Grigorenko & Sternberg, 2003). The genetic basis of aggression, however, remains poorly understood. Aggression is a multi-dimensional concept, but it can be generally defined as behavior that inflicts pain or harm on another. Genetic-developmental theory states that individual differences in a continuous phenotype result from the action of a large number of genes, each exerting an effect that works with environmental factors to produce the trait. This type of trait is influenced by multiple factors making it more complex and difficult to study than a simple Mendelian trait (one gene for one phenotype). History Past thought on genetic factors influencing aggression tended to seek answers from chromosomal abnormalities. Specifically, four decades ago, the XYY genotype was (erroneously) believed by many to be correlated with aggression. In 1965 and 1966, researchers at the MRC Clinical & Population Cytogenetics Research Unit led by Dr. Court Brown at Western General Hospital in Edinburgh reported finding a much higher than expected nine XYY men (2.9%) averaging almost 6 ft. tall in a survey of 314 patients at the State Hospital for Scotland; seven of the nine XYY patients were mentally retarded. In their initial reports published before examining the XYY patients, the researchers suggested they might have been hospitalized because of aggressive behavior. When the XYY patients were examined, the researchers found their assumptions of aggressive behavior were incorrect. Unfortunately, many science and medicine textbooks quickly and uncritically incorporated the initial, incorrect assumptions about XYY and aggression‚Äîincluding psychology textbooks on aggression. The XYY genotype first gained wide notoriety in 1968 when it was raised as a part of a defense in two murder trials in Australia and France. In the United States, five attempts to use the XYY genotype as a defense were unsuccessful‚Äîin only one case in 1969 was it allowed to go to a jury‚Äîwhich rejected it. Results from several decades of long-term follow-up of scores of unselected XYY males identified in eight international newborn chromosome screening studies in the 1960s and 1970s have replaced pioneering but biased studies from the 1960s (that used only institutionalized XYY men), as the basis for current understanding of the XYY genotype and established that XYY males are characterized by increased height but are not characterized by aggressive behavior. Though the link currently between genetics and aggression has turned to an aspect of genetics different from chromosomal abnormalities, it is important to understand where the research started and the direction it is moving towards today. Heritability Aggression, as well as other behavioral traits, is studied genetically based on its heritability through generations. Heritability models of aggression are mainly based on animals due to the ethical concern in using humans for genetic study. Animals are first selectively bred and then placed in a variety of environmental conditions, allowing researchers to examine the differences of selection in the aggression of animals. Research methods As with other topics in behavioral genetics, aggression is studied in three main experimental ways to help identify what role genetics plays in the behavior: * Heritability studies ‚Äì studies focused to determine whether a trait, such as aggression, is heritable and how it is inherited from parent to offspring. These studies make use of genetic linkage maps to identify genes associated with certain behaviors such as aggression. * Mechanism experiments ‚Äì studies to determine the biological mechanisms that lead certain genes to influence types of behavior like aggression. * Genetic behavior correlation studies ‚Äì studies that use scientific data and attempt to correlate it with actual human behavior. Examples include twin studies and adoption studies. These three main experimental types are used in animal studies, studies testing heritability and molecular genetics, and gene/environment interaction studies. Recently, important links between aggression and genetics have been studied and the results are allowing scientists to better understand the connections. Selective breeding The heritability of aggression has been observed in many animal strains after noting that some strains of birds, dogs, fish, and mice seem to be more aggressive than other strains. Selective breeding has demonstrated that it is possible to select for genes that lead to more aggressive behavior in animals. Selective breeding examples also allow researchers to understand the importance of developmental timing for genetic influences on aggressive behavior. A study done in 1983 (Cairns) produced both highly aggressive male and female strains of mice dependent on certain developmental periods to have this more aggressive behavior expressed. These mice were not observed to be more aggressive during the early and later stages of their lives, but during certain periods of time (in their middle-age period) were more violent and aggressive in their attacks on other mice. Selective breeding is a quick way to select for specific traits and see those selected traits within a few generations of breeding. These characteristics make selective breeding an important tool in the study of genetics and aggressive behavior. Mouse studies Mice are often used as a model for human genetic behavior since mice and humans have homologous genes coding for homologous proteins that are used for similar functions at some biological levels. Mice aggression studies have led to some interesting insight in human aggression. Using reverse genetics, the DNA of genes for the receptors of many neurotransmitters have been cloned and sequenced, and the role of neurotransmitters in rodent aggression has been investigated using pharmacological manipulations. Serotonin has been identified in the offensive attack by male mice against intruder male mice. Mutants were made by manipulating a receptor for serotonin by deleting a gene for the serotonin receptor. These mutant male mice with the knockout alleles exhibited normal behavior in everyday activities such as eating and exploration, but when prompted, attacked intruders with twice the intensity of normal male mice. In offense aggression in mice, males with the same or similar genotypes were more likely to fight than males that encountered males of other genotypes. Another interesting finding in mice dealt with mice reared alone. These mice showed a strong tendency to attack other male mice upon their first exposure to the other animals. The mice reared alone were not taught to be more aggressive; they simply exhibited the behavior. This implicates the natural tendency related to biological aggression in mice since the mice reared alone lacked a parent to model aggressive behavior. Oxidative stress arises as a result of excess production of reactive oxygen species in relation to defense mechanisms, including the action of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Knockout of the Sod1 gene was experimentally introduced in male mice leading to impaired antioxidant defense. These mice were designated (Sod1-/-). The Sod1-/- male mice proved to be more aggressive than both heterozygous knockout males (Sod1+/-) that were 50% deficient in SOD1, and wild-type males (Sod1+/+). The basis for the association of oxidative stress with increased aggression has not yet been determined. Biological mechanisms Experiments designed to study biological mechanisms are utilized when exploring how aggression is influenced by genetics. Molecular genetics studies allow many different types of behavioral traits to be examined by manipulating genes and studying the effect(s) of the manipulation. Molecular genetics A number of molecular genetics studies have focused on manipulating candidate aggression genes in mice and other animals to induce effects that can be possibly applied to humans. Most studies have focused on polymorphisms of serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors, and neurotransmitter metabolizing enzymes. Results of these studies have led to linkage analysis to map the serotonin-related genes and impulsive aggression, as well as dopamin-related genes and proactive aggression. In particular, the serotonin 5-HT seems to be an influence in inter-male aggression either directly or through other molecules that use the 5-HT pathway. 5-HT normally dampens aggression in animals and humans. Mice missing specific genes for 5-HT were observed to be more aggressive than normal mice and were more rapid and violent in their attacks. Other studies have been focused on neurotransmitters. Studies of a mutation in the neurotransmitter metabolizing enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) have been shown to cause a syndrome that includes violence and impulsivity in humans. Studies of the molecular genetics pathways are leading to the production of pharmaceuticals to fix the pathway problems and hopefully show an observed change in aggressive behavior. Human behavior genetics In determining if a trait is related to genetic factors or environmental factors, twin studies and adoption studies are used. These studies examine correlations based on similarity of a trait and a person's genetic or environmental factors that could influence the trait. Aggression has been examined via both twin studies and adoption studies. Twin studies Twin studies manipulate the environmental factors of behavior by examining if identical twins raised apart are different from twins raised together. Before the advancement of molecular genetics, twin studies were almost the only mode of investigation of genetic influences on personality. Heritability was estimated as twice the difference between the correlation for identical, or monozygotic, twins and that for fraternal, or dizygotic, twins. Early studies indicated that personality was fifty percent genetic. Current thinking holds that each individual picks and chooses from a range of stimuli and events largely on the basis of his genotype creating a unique set of experiences; basically meaning that people create their own environments.

It was directed by Walt Disney with Ub Iwerks as the head animator. The title is written as Barn Dance on the poster, while the full title is used on the title screen. Plot The barn dance of the title is the occasion which brings together Minnie Mouse and her two suitors: Mickey and Peg-Leg Pete. The latter two and their vehicles are first seen arriving at Minnie's house in an attempt to pick her up for the dance. Mickey turns up in his horse-cart while Pete in a newly purchased automobile. Minnie initially chooses Pete to drive her to the dance but the automobile unexpectedly breaks down. She resorts to accepting Mickey's invitation. They are later seen dancing together, but Mickey proves to be a rather clumsy dancer as he repeatedly steps on Minnie's feet. She consequently turns down his invitation for a second dance. She instead accepts that of Pete, who proves to be a better dancing partner. Mickey then attempts to solve his problem by placing a balloon in his shorts. That apparently helps him to be \\"light on his feet\\" and he proceeds to ask Minnie for another dance. She accepts and is surprised to find his dancing skills to have apparently improved. Pete soon discovers Mickey's trick and points it out to Minnie. Minnie is visibly disgusted by this attempt at deception. As a result, she leaves Mickey and resumes dancing with Pete, leaving Mickey crying on the floor. Production Like Mickey's previous cartoon, Steamboat Willie, The Barn Dance was planned as a sound cartoon, and there are many sound gags, including Mickey using a passing duck as a horn for his car. The dance also demonstrates the studio's increasing facility with mixing cartoon action with musical rhythm. This short is notable for featuring Mickey turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete. It is also an unusual appearance of the Pete character; previously depicted as a menacing villain, he is portrayed here as a well-mannered gentleman. In addition, Mickey was not depicted as a hero but as a rather ineffective young suitor. In his sadness and crying over his failure, Mickey appears unusually emotional and vulnerable. The style of Pete's clothing and car were the inspiration for his appearance in the 2013 short Get a Horse! Reception Variety (February 13, 1929): \\"The Barn Dance has laughs, although a little jerky in spots. It can be spotted anywhere on talking short programs as pleasant relaxation and change of diet from the straightaway shorts with human actors.\\" Motion Picture News (February 16, 1929): \\"Walt Disney has evolved another of those animal characters for comedy purposes. This is Mickey Mouse. Mickey is wooing another mousie and takes her to a barn dance with a lot of the usual comedy ticks following. There are some laughs in it.\\" The Film Daily (February 17, 1929): \\"This is another of the adventure of Mickey Mouse and his sweetie. The villain cat tries to take gal driving in his auto, which is wrecked. So she goes to the barn dance with Mickey who is driving his carriage drawn by the old plug. This horse is one of the funniest cartoon characters seen in the animateds. Later at the dance the cat shows up and tries to take the gal away again, but Mickey fools him. The sound effects are funny, and this number enhances the usual cartoon subject easily 100 per cent.\\" Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Pete: Billy Bletcher See also *Mickey Mouse (film series) References External links   The Barn Dance at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts Category:Disney animated short films, 1920s Category:1929 films Category:1929 comedy films Category:1929 animated films Category:Mickey Mouse short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Walt Disney Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Columbia Pictures short films Category:Columbia Pictures animated short films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about cats Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films without speech ","title":"The Barn Dance"},{"id":"7070612","text":"Kartell showroom Kartell is an Italian company that makes and sells plastic contemporary furniture.

After the Flying Burrito Brothers scored a minor country hit in 1979 with a live cover of Merle Haggard's \\"White Line Fever\\", the band was dropped from their record contract and hit yet again with personnel changes. By 1980, Greg Harris and Ed Ponder had left the group, leaving the Burritos as a trio of \\"Sneaky\\" Pete Kleinow, Gib Guilbeau and Skip Battin. In addition to commitments with the Flying Burrito Brothers, Guilbeau was also working as a songwriter for Criterion Music with John Beland, who Guilbeau knew from his time in the band Swampwater. Guilbeau and Beland wrote some songs and ultimately, Beland was invited to join the Burritos. Beland was reluctant to join the now nearly defunct band, as he was riding strong as lead guitarist with Ricky Nelson who (with Beland's help) was enjoying his own comeback of sorts. However, after leaving Nelson in the hopes of producing the Burritos, Beland who took the Burritos to a more commercial direction, having written a number of country hits for other artists prior to his joining the FBB. In addition, the band's name was shortened to simply The Burrito Brothers, a suggestion by Curb Records. Beland's song demos, which featured the Burritos on them, eventually made it to Dick Whitehouse at Curb records, who signed the band to a deal with Curb / Epic Records. By December 1980, the band's first single for Curb, \\"She's a Friend of a Friend\\" reached the US country top 70. Hearts on the Line followed in January 1981 and spawned two further singles, both of which made the US country top 20, \\"Does She Wish She Was Single Again?\\" and \\"She Belongs to Everyone But Me\\". More would follow. That year, The Burrito Brothers received the number one \\"Crossover from pop to country\\" award from Billboard Magazine as well as best new vocal group award from Record World Magazine. Skip Battin was fired from the band after the photo shoot for the album cover of Hearts on the Line, and was replaced in the studio by Dennis Belfield on bass. Mickey McGee was also replaced on drums by Ron Krasinsky, for the recordings. The success of the Burrito Brothers marked the first time in the band's 11-year history of having any serious chart success. During their span as a country hit act, they scored nine hits for Curb Records. Despite this success, the album is currently unavailable.

It was the fifth Mickey Mouse short to be released, the second of that year. It cast Mickey as the owner of a small theater (or opera house according to the title). Mickey performs a vaudeville show all by himself. Acts include his impersonation of a snake charmer, his dressing in drag and performing a belly dance, his caricature of a Hasidic Jew and, for the finale, a piano performance. Synopsis The cartoon starts with the opening of a theater and Mickey Mouse sweeping and using the broom as an instrument and a dance partner. Mickey is then faced with a large show goer, who must be deflated in order to fit through the doorway. The band takes over, with a large variety of short gags occurring throughout. Following, Mickey Mouse becomes the star of the show, taking on the multiple roles of a vaudeville star. The cartoon ends with a humorous fight between himself and a piano and a stool.Mickey Mouse in The Opry House. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxVJwH_89o Mickey's interactions are highly stylized in order to capture the essence of what a vaudeville performance should be.Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age. OUP Oxford, 2003 pg. 59. Production The Opry House was the fifth Mickey Mouse cartoon released by Walt Disney Productions. It appears in black and white, and the audio was recorded using Pat Powers's cinephone system.Iwerks, Ub. The Opry House. Comedy, Family, Animation, Short, Music, 1929. It was animated mostly by Ub Iwerks, Walt Disney's first employee who later became known as a ‚ÄúDisney Legend‚Äù.‚ÄúUb Iwerks‚Äù https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412650/ The short became the most expensive early Disney short, its negative cost being almost $2,500 more than the Steamboat Willie cartoon produced just a year prior. This short is an early example of how the Disney studio's animated shorts became more sophisticated. The short shows more realistic animating. The early Disney cartoons, like Steamboat Willie show many similarities to the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons that preceded them. However, as Mickey Mouse evolved from the silent film era, the cartoons became more intricate. Mickey Mouse began interacting within his space in his cartoon world to create a more realist feel.Telotte, J.P. ‚ÄúThe Stereoscopic Mickey: Space, Animation, and the Mouse‚Äù. Walt Disney himself reinforces this idea: > ‚Äú...Our characters were beginning to act & behave like real persons. Because > of this we could begin to put real feeling and charm into our > characterization. After all you can't expect charm from animated sticks and > that is what Mickey Mouse was in his first pictures‚Äù.Barrier, Michael. > Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age. OUP Oxford, 2003 > pg. 86 Mickey's fight with the piano would be reused and extended seven months later in the cartoon The Jazz Fool. Use of sound This short features no dialogue and consequently its humor relies on a long series of visual gags. The accompanying musical pieces notably include \\"Yankee Doodle\\", Rachmaninoff's \\"Prelude in C# Minor (Op. 2/3)\\" and Georges Bizet's Carmen. It is also the first appearance of \\"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\\" by Franz Liszt in a cartoon, and its use heavily influenced later cartoons including the Merrie Melodies short Rhapsody in Rivets (1941), Bugs Bunny's Rhapsody Rabbit (1946), Tom and Jerry's The Cat Concerto (1947) and Woody Woodpecker's Convict Concerto. The sound for the short was recorded in February 1929 in New York by Walt Disney and Carl Stalling, who recorded the scores for the early Disney shorts including Steamboat Willie. Because there is no dialogue the music aids in telling the story. The music not only matches the actions being animated but the two are deeply connected. In one sequence a drummer pulls the tails of three different cats; those cat's meows become notes in the music sequence. Notable dialogue did not come until 1934, when Walt Disney voiced Mickey Mouse using a falsetto. Therefore, the comedy of the short comes in large parts to the use of music. Mickey's gloves This short also introduced Mickey's gloves; Mickey can be seen wearing them in most of his subsequent appearances. Reportedly, one reason for adding the white gloves was to allow audiences to distinguish the characters' hands when they appeared against their bodies, as both were black. (Mickey didn't appear in color until The Band Concert in 1935.) Other characters Mickey Mouse takes on multiple roles within the story of his vaudeville show. The short holds true to the early structure of Mickey Mouse cartoons. They are short, with less emphasis on storytelling and more focus on adventure and comedy. A variety of additional animals make up the crowd and the band members. In addition, the instruments, especially the piano and stool take on human qualities, making them integral characters. Minnie Mouse does not appear in person in this short. Instead, a poster of her can be seen which introduces her as a member of the Yankee Doodle Girls, apparently a group of female performers. The only other recurring character to appear in the short is known as Kat Nipp (apparently a play on the word catnip). This would be his debut; he would appear in two more shorts during the year as a minor antagonist. Reception Variety (April 10, 1929): \\"Another of the Mickey Mouse series captioned \\"The Opery House\\", [sic] from Walt Disney's cartoonistic shop. The opery idea provides for a stage presentment of vaude bits effectively sounded. Sound accompaniment has made the cartoon strips much more valuable. And the comedy point intended is more decided in the building. Some funny stuff here, especially the piano number which has the instrument given the real planner synchronization, surprising in comparison with former silent strips.\\" The Film Daily (July 28, 1929): \\"Perfectly Swell. Even the piano takes on life in this Mickey Mouse release. Walt Disney is maintaining the high standard established with Steamboat Willie. The Op'ry House demonstrates this fact in view of the amusing kinks injected into the animation and the funny situations thereby created. One of the best sound shorts on the market, this release merits attention as a laugh- provoker.\\" See also *Mickey Mouse (film series) References External links  * Category:Disney animated short films, 1920s Category:1929 films Category:1929 comedy films Category:1929 animated films Category:Mickey Mouse short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Walt Disney Category:Films directed by Ub Iwerks Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Columbia Pictures short films Category:Columbia Pictures animated short films Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films without speech ","title":"The Opry House"},{"id":"7070643","text":"A petroleum geologist is an earth scientist who works in the field of petroleum geology, which involves all aspects of oil discovery and production. Petroleum geologists are usually linked to the actual discovery of oil and the identification of possible oil deposits, gas caps, or leads. It can be a very labor-intensive task involving several different fields of science and elaborate equipment. Petroleum geologists look at the structural and sedimentary aspects of the stratum/strata to identify possible oil traps or tight shale plays. Profile Petroleum geologists make the decision of where to drill for petroleum. This is done by locating prospects within a sedimentary basin. Petroleum geologists determine a prospect's viability looking at seven main aspects in conventional petroleum geology: * Source ‚Äì The presence of an organic-rich source rock capable of generating hydrocarbons during deep burial. * Reservoir ‚Äì The usually porous rock and permeable unit that collects the hydrocarbons expelled from the source rock and holds them inside a trap. * Seal ‚Äì The rock unit that inhibits the oil or gas from escaping from a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rock. * Trap ‚Äì Structural or stratigraphic feature that captures migrating hydrocarbons into an economically producible accumulation. * Timing ‚Äì Geologic events must occur in a certain order, e.g. that the trap formed before migration rather than after. * Maturation ‚Äì The process of alteration of a source rock under heat and pressure, leading to the cracking of its organic matter into oil and gas. * Migration ‚Äì The movement of the (less dense) oil or gas from the source rock into a reservoir rock and then into a trap. These seven key aspects require the petroleum geologist to obtain a 4-dimensional idea of the subsurface (the three spatial dimensions, plus time). Data may be obtained via Geophysical methods. Geophysical surveys show the seismology data of elastic waves, mainly seismic reflection. This provides a 3-dimensional look of the trap, and source rock. More data may be obtained from the mudlogger, who analyzes the drill cuttings and the rock formation thicknesses. Today, there are also unconventional tight plays. Petroleum geologists for these plays work with petroleum engineers and other specialists to make decisions of where to drill for oil. Data is also obtained via geophysicsal methods (the same as conventional plays, plus fracture data), but these are modernly analyzed with various statistical methods. The geological analysis is done by looking at a combination of geological aspects, with completion analogs. The geological aspects are as follows: *Source - The presence of an organic-rich source rock. Unlike conventional plays, where the source rock typically underlays the reservoir rock and the oil/gas migrates into the reservoir, tight shale plays can be their own source rock. *Reservoir- The usually porous rock with lower permeability rock. This rock could have collected hydrocarbons expelled from a source rock, or be its own source rock. *Seal - Often, due to the low permeability, oil/gas is unable to migrate out of this rock, but it is common to also have a sealing rock above the reservoir rock that inhibits further migration of oil or gas. *Timing - Geologic events must occur in a certain order, e.g. A seal to trap gas must be in place before kerogen cracking. *Maturation - The process of alteration of a source rock under head and pressure, leading to the cracking of its organic matter into oil and gas. *Migration- The movement of the (less dense) oil or gas from the source rock into a reservoir rock and then into a trap. Note that the aspect trap is absent. Tight shale plays, or unconventional plays, do not require a trap to contain hydrocarbons due to the low permeability preventing further migration.

Many successful attempts have been made to \\"open up\\" stage plays to show things that could not possibly be done in the theatre (notably in The Sound of Music, in which the Alps and the city of Salzburg were displayed, in Frost/Nixon, and in Franco Zeffirelli's and Kenneth Branagh's respective films of Shakespeare plays). Many critics claim to notice the origins of stage-to- film adaptations when the characters speak. A play depends mostly on dialogue, so there is supposedly more of it in a play than in a film, and more of a tendency for the characters to make long speeches and/or soliloquies. Writers, directors and critics often claim that film makes more use of short, abrupt sentences, realistic ways of speaking, and physical action than the stage does. Another supposedly \\"dead giveaway\\" that a film is based on a play is confining great chunks of the action to one room, as in the faithful 1962 film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night, or as in Laurence Olivier's Richard III. Olivier deliberately emphasized the fact that his Henry V (1944) was based on a play by having the film begin at what was supposed to be Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, then moving into deliberately fake scenery and having the scenery gradually become more and more real until finally the viewing audience is looking at a real location, finally gradually switching back to the Globe Theatre. On some occasions, playwrights re-write their stage dramas for the screen, as Peter Shaffer did for Amadeus (1984), and as Peter Morgan did with Frost/Nixon (2008). Shaffer's screenplay made much use of camera movements and scenery that could only be suggested on-stage, as did Morgan with Frost/Nixon. For Amadeus, Shaffer even added scenes and heavily revised others for his original creation to take advantage of the medium. The scene in which the ill Mozart dictates his Requiem Mass to Salieri, while his imagined music is heard on the soundtrack, could only have been done on film. The film also allowed the music to be heard in six-track hi-fi sound, while in the play the audience heard it through tinny loudspeakers. In other cases, such as Camille (1936), Cabaret (1972), and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), the original stage dialogue is completely discarded and an entirely new script is written for the film version, even if the basic plot of the play is still followed. This has also happened with musical films such as the 1936 and 1954 film versions of Rose-Marie, the 1943 and 1953 versions of The Desert Song, and the 1954 version of The Student Prince. In the case of the 1936 Rose-Marie, the plot of the film had almost nothing to do with the stage version, other than using a very few of the stage version's songs, having a Canadian setting, and having Mounties as characters. In the case of adaptations of stage musicals, it happened most often with musical films produced before 1955, the year that the faithful film version of Oklahoma! was released. The quick succession of other Rodgers and Hammerstein films, all close adaptations of their stage originals, caused other studios to continue to adapt Broadway musicals to the screen with fewer changes than had been customary in the past. In the case of the unsuccessful Broadway musical Paint Your Wagon, new characters and songs were added, and the stage musical's plot was almost completely changed for the 1969 film, in order to bolster the film's chances of success.

It was the seventh Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the fourth of that year. As the title implies, it features a battle between an invading army of cats and an army of mice trying to defend their homes and farms. Plot Peg-Leg Pete is depicted as a leading soldier of the former army, and Mickey as a conscript of the latter one. Before joining the army, Mickey has to pass a physical examination. This scene depicts Mickey becoming the subject of physical and emotional abuse. After passing the examination, he is given a machine gun and is sent to battle. Mickey's combat efforts are comical in depiction but prove effective enough in forcing the enemy to retreat. In the end, Mickey smacks a line of advancing soldiers on the head with a mallet, and is hailed as a hero by his fellow soldiers. Production This short is notable as the first to depict Mickey as a soldier and the first to place him in combat. The physical examination scene has since often been edited out, as being somewhat disturbing. However, modern viewers have often pointed to this scene as being the most memorable of the short. There was a precedent in Disney's cartoons for sending the main character to war: Julius the Cat calls an army together in the 1926 Alice Comedies short Alice's Little Parade, and Oswald the Lucky Rabbit goes to war in the 1927 cartoon Great Guns! The mouse officer shouting \\"Company, forward march!\\" is the first character in the Mickey Mouse cartoons to speak a full sentence. Before this, characters have only communicated in single-syllable sounds and laughs, or in the case of Minnie Mouse, the greeting, \\"Yoo-Hoo!\\" This is the last Mickey Mouse cartoon in which Mickey is shown as mouse-sized among a crowd of other mice; after this, Mickey and Minnie became the only mice living in a world of other anthropomorphized animals. The short did not clearly identify the war it depicted, but it has been noted that the cats are depicted as wearing military helmets similar to those used by the German Empire during World War I. On the other hand, the mice are marching in battle to the tune of \\"Dixie\\", a song written in 1859. The song was popular among the forces of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. The victory of the mice is celebrated in the tune of \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\", known to have been popular among the forces of the United States during the same conflict. In any case, both wars were still within living memory of the audiences at the time of release and so it is possible that the details mentioned were intended as recognizable references to both of them. Because the cats wear helmets that resemble German pickelhaube, the cartoon was banned in Germany in 1930 on the grounds of being \\"offensive to national dignity\\". Legacy and influence An LCD Game & Watch- styled mini-game based on the short appears in the 2019 video game Kingdom Hearts III.

It was the eighth Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the fifth of that year. Synopsis As the title implies, Mickey is depicted as a farmer alongside Minnie Mouse. He is first seen with his horse while plowing a field. Then Minnie comes along with her cow. She has Mickey milk the cow for her. As he does, the cow starts licking him in an apparent sign of affection. Mickey does not seem pleased and replies by rolling up its muzzle with its own tongue. Mickey eventually manages to present Minnie with a full bucket of milk and proceeds forcefully to kiss her. Minnie's reply to this sign of affection is knocking his head with the bucket. At some point the horse is stung by a bee, panics and starts galloping. By the time the horse calms down again, the plow has been broken. In the finale, Mickey resorts to using a pig as a plow. Impact Curiously, the short is considered mainly notable for the livestock it featured. Minnie's cow is considered to be Clarabelle Cow making her second appearance, and Mickey's plow horse is considered to be Horace Horsecollar making his debut. Both characters became fully anthropomorphic in the 1930 short The Shindig, where they're treated as Mickey and Minnie's friends rather than farm animals. By 1933, Disney Studio publicity referred to The Plowboy as Horace's first film. This short is also the first time Minnie Mouse is seen wearing her gloves. Reception The Film Daily (July 28, 1929): \\"Splendid. The Disney studio is clicking right along on with its Mickey Mouse cartoon series. The animation is not only clever but packs an idea as well. The adventures of Mickey are not particularly important, but they are funny. A fine subject, replete with fun and laughs.\\" Variety (Nov 27, 1929): \\"Clever as to conception and sound effects, but as heard here faulty and well nigh inaudible. That it got laughs despite this is a testimonial. What was wrong can only be guessed. Before and after shorts played on Western Electric discs came through well. Needless to emphasize that if this was a matter of servicing Cinephone should give it prompt attention, even in a daily change grind. After the success of the first of this sound series at the Colony and Strand on Broadway, the distributors got an unusually big break. There is probably no cartoonist who personally or through assistants consistently has gotten so much originality into his stuff as Walter Disney. At this advanced stage of sound, mediocre reproduction calls for investigations, not alibis.\\" See also *Mickey Mouse (film series) References External links  The Plowboy at Mickey Mouse Follies: Black and White * Category:Disney animated short films, 1920s Category:1929 short films Category:1929 comedy films Category:American short films Category:American animated short films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Mickey Mouse short films Category:1929 animated films Category:1929 films Category:Films directed by Walt Disney Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:American comedy films Category:Films without speech Category:Columbia Pictures short films Category:Columbia Pictures animated short films ","title":"The Plowboy"},{"id":"7070728","text":"Kabuliwala ( KƒÅbuli'≈ç·∫èƒÅlƒÅ, \\"Kabul wallah\\") is a 1957 Bengali film directed by Tapan Sinha and based on the eponymous 1892 short story by the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore. Plot Rahmat (Chhabi Biswas), a middle-age fruit seller from Afghanistan, comes to Calcutta to hawk his merchandise. He befriends a small Bengali girl called Mini (Oindrila Tagore aka Tinku Tagore) who reminds him of his daughter back in Afghanistan. He stays at a boarding house with his countrymen. One day, Rahmat receives a letter with news of his daughter's illness; he decides to leave for his country. Since he is short of money he sells his goods on credit to increase his business. Later, when he goes to collect his money, one of his customers abuses him. In the fight that ensues, Rahmat warns that he will not tolerate abuse and stabs the guy when he does not stop. In the court Rahmat's lawyer tries to obfuscate the facts but, in his characteristic and simple fashion, Rahmat states the truth in a matter- of-fact way. The judge, pleased with Rahmat's honesty, gives him 10 years' rigorous imprisonment instead of the death sentence. On the day of his release he goes to meet Mini and discovers that she has grown up into a 14-year-old girl who is about to get married. Mini does not recognize the aged Rahmat, who realizes that his daughter must have forgotten him, too. Mini's father advises him to go back to his homeland and Mini's mother gives Rahmat the money for travel out of the wedding budget to which Mini agrees; she also sends a gift for Rahmat's daughter.

In 2005, the group campaigned against dawn raids, raised public awareness and found support in the Scottish Parliament. Their story has been told in a musical and a film. History The group all attended Drumchapel High School in Glasgow and formed in 2005 with the support of their teacher Euan Girvan, in response to the detention of one of their friends, Agnesa Murselaj. The name came from two of its members, Amal Azzudin and Roza Salih. Pupils at the school signed a petition, then 26 MSPs signed a parliamentary motion praising the pupils' actions. By September 2005, their efforts had gained national attention. The girls challenged the then First Minister Jack McConnell on the matter and publicly voiced their concerns as more children at their school were being dawn raided, detained and deported. After visiting the Scottish Parliament twice, The Glasgow Girls obtained cross-party support on the issue. The group won the Scottish Campaign of the Year Award in 2005 at the annual Scottish politician of the year ceremony for their hard work. However, it did not stop them from demanding to know just what had happened to the \\"protocol\\" that Jack McConnell had promised to obtain from the Home Office that social services, education services, and the Immigration police would be consulted before any decision was made on the removal of a family. Two documentaries have been made by the BBC about their campaign- Tales from the Edge won the Nations and Regions Award in the Amnesty International UK Media Awards. It took until September 2008 for the Murselaj family to be granted permanent leave to remain. Salih gained a place at Strathclyde University and studied law and politics. In 2014, the university announced scholarship funding for three asylum seekers to enable them to study there. In January 2017 Salih announced that she would stand as an SNP candidate in the local elections later that year. Depiction in popular culture In 2012, the National Theatre of Scotland presented a modern musical at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow depicting the life of the Glasgow Girls. The musical then had a run at Stratford East Theatre in London and returned to the Citizens in 2014 as part of the Glasgow 2014 Cultural Programme. BBC Scotland created a new musical television drama which aired on BBC Three on 15 July 2014. It won an award for drama at the Royal Television Society Scotland Awards 2014 and best TV drama at the BAFTA Scotland awards in November 2015.

Under both the Republican and Conservative Party banners, he served in the New York State Senate from 1963 to 1970 and in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1993. Early life Lent was born in Oceanside, Nassau County, New York. He graduated from Malverne High School in 1948, from Hofstra University in 1952, and from Cornell Law School in 1957. Lent served as a code breaker in the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1954, during and immediately after the Korean War Following his military service, Lent worked as a lawyer in private practice in Lynbrook, New York beginning in 1957, and served as an Associate Police Justice in East Rockaway from 1959 to 1960. He then worked as Confidential Law Secretary for New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas P. Farley from 1960 to 1962. Political career New York State Senate Lent was a member of the New York State Senate from 1963 to 1970, sitting in the 174th, 175th, 176th, 177th and 178th New York State Legislatures. As a State Senator, he opposed the integration of the elementary schools in Malverne, which the state's education commissioner ordered in 1963. After the United States Supreme Court upheld order, Lent introduced an anti-busing bill in the State Senate that was ultimately signed into law but found unconstitutional by a federal court. Lent stated that he opposed the order because the integration could undermine neighborhood schools. Lent supported efforts to expand the grounds under which women could have legal abortions in New York. He headed both the Joint Committee on Public Health as well as the Senate Health Committee and pushed for a limited expansion of the law in order to reduce the number of illegal abortions taking place. The joint committee recommended expanding the legal grounds to include forcible rape, incest, substantial risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, unmarried mothers under 16 years, ‚Äúgross abnormalities‚Äù of the fetus, and mental incompetence or physical disability of the mother. Congressional service Lent was elected as a Republican to the 92nd, 93rd, 94th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, 99th, 100th, 101st and 102nd United States Congresses, holding office from January 3, 1971, to January 3, 1993. He was a delegate or alternate delegate to the 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1992 Republican National Conventions. Lent entered Congress by defeating an incumbent, the controversial Democratic representative Allard K. Lowenstein, by 9,300 votes in a hotly contested election in a newly drawn, largely Republican district. One of his campaign slogans was the play on words, \\"Let's vote out Lowenstein for Lent.\\" Long Island's generally liberal Five Towns region had recently been removed from the district, and the far more conservative Massapequa added, during Congressional redistricting by the Republican-controlled State legislature. The election was viewed nationwide as a referendum on President Richard Nixon's conduct of the Vietnam War. Lent supported Nixon's policy of gradually withdrawing American Forces from Vietnam while turning the fighting over to the South Vietnamese Army. As a U.S. Representative, Lent was endorsed several times by Long Island's largest newspaper, Newsday, whose editors called Lent a \\"key player in environmental and energy legislation\\". He was most active as a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, ultimately becoming the ranking minority member of both committees. Lent worked on drafting and handled floor debate for the Republican minority on some of the most sweeping environmental, energy, telecommunications and transportation legislation enacted during his tenure. These included the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, National Energy Policy Act of 1992, Cable Television Act, Legislation ending the 1992 National Rail Strike, the Superfund Act (CERCLA), Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TOSCA), the Conrail Privatization Act, and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud, Enforcement Act. Lent held Honorary Doctor of Laws Degrees from Hofstra University (1988) and Molloy College (1985) and was the recipient of the Prime Minister's Medal, State of Israel (1977), Distinguished Achievement Medal, Holland Society of New York (1987) and the George Estabrook achievement Award, Hofstra University (1967), along with many other awards. Lent died on June 11, 2012 at his home in Arlington, Virginia, of cancer.

It was used for freight, joy-riding and passenger services. It was also used by many commercial operators and for some military purposes. Design and development It was a twin-engined high-wing monoplane of plastic-bonded plywood construction with some spruce and metal parts. It had fixed tricycle undercarriage, three vertical tail and rudder units, one central and two as tailplane endplates, reminiscent of the Miles Messenger. A large fin area was required by the deep-sided forward fuselage, and a pod and boom fuselage. Two pilots were seated beneath a large clear perspex canopy which formed the front dorsal part of the pod, four or five circular windows providing a view for passengers on either side. The Aerovan was capable of lifting a family car, loaded through clamshell rear doors. Designed in 1944, the prototype was built at Miles factory at Woodley, Berkshire and was first flown there by Tommy Rose on 26 January 1945.Jackson, 1974, p. 79 Aerovan production started in 1946 primarily for civil use, although examples were used briefly by the military of Israel and New Zealand. Production ended late in 1947. A licence was granted to manufacture the type in France but no production resulted. One RNZAF machine was converted, unsuccessfully, for aerial fertiliser spreading and a second for aeromagnetic survey work.http://www.adf-serials.com.au/nz- serials/nzaerovan.htm One Mark 4 was used for research with a Hurel-Dubois high aspect ratio wing in 1957, being then known as the Miles HDM.105. The prototype retroactively named the Mark 1 was later fitted with a 5/6th replica of the Armstrong Siddeley Mamba turboprop nacelle for the Miles Marathon. Service Most Mk 3 and 4 Aerovans were employed on passenger and freight services, charter work and joyriding in the UK and in the Near East. Meridian Air Maps operated Aerovan 4 G-AISF on aerial survey work from October 1955 until it crashed on takeoff from Manchester (Ringway) on 29 April 1957.Jackson, 1974, p. 499 The accident killed the pilot Jean Lennox Bird, the first woman to receive RAF wings, and two passengers. The RNZAF evaluated two Aerovan 4s during 1950. The newly formed Israeli Air Force acquired a single Aerovan G-AJWI from the UK which entered service in June 1948. Able to use very short landing strips it was flown into settlements and Jerusalem airport in the face of defensive rifle fire. On 17 July 1948 it made a forced landing south of Tel Aviv and was destroyed by Palestinians.Dor 2004, pp. 26‚Äì28.

The tokens were originally created as patterns to demonstrate a new type of metal for coinage, however when these proposals failed, they were temporarily used by the public during depressions to accommodate a small change shortage. History Lewis Feuchtwanger (born in F√ºrth, Bavaria on January 11, 1805) received a doctorate at the University of Jena and then moved to New York City. He was primarily a mineralogist, metallurgist, and chemist, but also worked as a physician and was a member of a number of learned societies. He wrote four books on mineralogy and chemicals. In 1837, to alleviate the need for small change during the Hard Times, Feuchtwanger created tokens made of argentan (commonly known as German Silver), an alloy made of copper, nickel, zinc, tin and trace metals. It was considerably cheaper to produce than the extraction of copper for the government minted half-cents and cents. The Hard Times, an especially rough period of economic recession following the dissolution of the Second Bank of the United States, was known for massive hoarding of small change. Much of the small change circulating at this time (roughly 1837-1844) was composed of clunky copper half-cents and cents privately produced or various cut and whole silver coins of foreign origin. In fact, it would not be until 1857, that Congress would enact into law that legal currency be coin of United States Mint origin. In 1837, Feuchtwanger presented his one cent coins to Congress for approval as legal coinage and a cheaper substitute for copper. This was probably the first attempt to circulate \\"nickel\\" coinage in the United States. Congress denied his request, but Feuchtwanger persisted in his production and circulation. Laws banning private coinage were not passed until 1864. Between 1837 and 1844 thousands of Feuchtwanger cents came out of his New York City pharmacy. To the discerning collector over a dozen different die casts have been identified, affecting the relative rarity of each specimen found. Aside from one cent tokens, in 1864 Feuchtwanger also produced three cent tokens which are considered extremely rare, as few specimens have survived. Feuchtwanger was also noted for producing stamp-like casts featuring his common theme of a pouncing eagle attacking a snake.

He gratudated from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, and served as the president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union for two terms. Prasad played a key role in the development of the All India Students Association. On 31 March 1997, he was assassinated by sharpshooters allegedly in the employ of Mohammad Shahabuddin of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, while addressing street corner meetings in the district town of Siwan, Bihar in support of a strike. His assassination led to remarkable student protests across India. In 2012, four people were convicted for his murder and life sentences were awarded to each of them; all the convicted were former members of the Janata Dal (later split into Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal). Early life and education Chandrashekhar Prasad was born in 20 September 1964 in Siwan, Bihar. His father was a sergeant in the Indian Air Force who died of a heart attack when he was 8 years old. His mother, Kaushalya Devi states that she only got as compensation for her husband's service to the forces but made sure her son was educated well. Chandrashekhar completed his intermediate education at Army School in Jhumri Tilaiya. Following his schooling, he was selected for National Defence Academy training in Pune. He joined the program but left it after 2 years stating dissatisfaction. He subsequently enrolled in Patna University and became involved in the All India Students Federation as an active member but became disillusioned with the federation some time afterwards. In 1990, he joined Jawaharlal Nehru University for a MPhil degree in English literature. He later started working on a PhD on Bihar's popular folk theater form Bidesia but was assassinated before he could complete it.  Political activism  Chandrashekhar Prasad became associated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation during the formation of the All India Students Association. In an Aligarh town hall, he expressed his desire to bring a \\"revolution\\" for clean politics in India. He is credited for almost single handedly building up the All India Students Association during his stay in Jawaharlal Nehru University. He was elected to the body of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union as the vice president for one term and president for two terms. He is described to have played a key role in creating the foundations of labourers, students, women's and dalits rights movements among the students community. After completing his M. Phil, he decided to move back to his hometown of Siwan to start a movement there. Prasad was deputed as a youth leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation in Siwan. He began campaigning against corruption and alleged criminal leaders of the region. He is described to have made considerable inroads as a mass leader and posed a threat to the Janata Dal (later split into Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal), the ruling party in Bihar. After his death, Brij Bihari Pandey stated that Mohammad Shahabuddin, the Member of Parliament from the Siwan constituency was threatened by the activism of Chandrashekhar who was considered as a candidate from the constituency in the upcoming elections. Assassination Prasad was addressing a nukkad sabha (corner meeting) on J.P Road in Siwan, Bihar on 31 March 1997 for organising a bandh (general strike) called in Bihar to protest against the mass murders and scandals that were rampant in the state. During the meeting, he was killed in a mass shooting along with another activist, Shyam Narayan Yadav and a hawker Bhutele Miyan. Mohammad Shahabuddin who was a member of parliament and known as a strongman in the district, was the prime accused for the shooting along with 5 other members of the Janata Dal (later split into Janata Dal (United) and Rashtriya Janata Dal).  Student protests  Following the assassination of Chandrashekhar Prasad, there were \\"unprecedented protests\\" by students across India. In Delhi, students from the Jawaharlal Nehru University marched to the Bihar Niwas demanding a dialogue with the then Chief Minister of Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav. In response, Sadhu Yadav, a leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal had allegedly ordered a mass shooting on the student protesters by the police. The protests occurred in various university campuses across major institutions such as Banaras Hindu University, Jadavpur University, Jamia Millia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University and University of Lucknow among others; led by Kaushalya Devi, the mother of Chandrashekhar. Devi had been offered monetary compensation by the Government of Bihar which she had refused. The All India Students Association also demanded the arrest of Sadhu Yadav and capital punishment for Mohammad Shahabuddin. The student protests were able to pressurise Lalu Prasad Yadav into allowing the Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate the case. The term goonda raj to refer to the criminalisation of politics in Bihar was coined during these protests.  Investigation and trial  On 26 February 2012, following the investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation, a special court convicted 3 of the accused, sentenced them to life imprisonment and fined each of them a sum of . The general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya however expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and stated that the verdict was \\"disappointing inadequate\\" and that the courts had skirted the \\"political charecterisation of the murder\\" by ignoring the charges on Mohammad Shahabuddin, the prime accused in the case. On 23 March 2012, a fourth accused was sentenced for life whose trial had run separately and a fifth accused had died during the course of the trials, therefore, no convictions were brought against him. Following the trials, the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation states that the CBI treated the crime like a case of random shooting instead of a political assassination. The party maintains the position that no justice was granted with the verdict where a young activist was killed by a sitting member of Parliament and only his hitmen were sentenced.  Recognition  In 2010, filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt initiated a project to create a biopic of Chandrashekhar Prasad titled Chandu. The announcement invoked controversy against any perceived sense of distortions of facts on the contemporary figure. The project however stated that the film will not indulge in any distortion of facts for commercial gains and will be produced as a documentary film. The documentary film maker Ajay Kanchan was employed as the director of the film. The actor Imran Zahid was casted to play the role of Chandrashekhar \\"Chandu\\" Prasad. In 2013, the project was scrapped due to opposition to its production and concerns of potential legal hurdles as a result of the cases related to the assassination being sub judice at the time. The project was revived in 2016 and is currently under production as a non-commercial documentary. In 2017, a memorial statue of Chandrashekhar Prasad was installed in Gopalganj More Chowk (which has been renamed to Chandrashekhar Chowk) in Siwan, Bihar. Kaushalya Devi, the mother of Chandrashekhar has also donated a piece of land near the memorial to the Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) Liberation for the construction of a school and a library in his honor.

MPL is the largest public library system in Wisconsin. History The Milwaukee Public Library can trace its lineage back to 1847 when the Young Men's Association started a subscription library that collected dues from its members. The group rented space for its library in a number of locations over the years and expanded into sponsoring a lecture series with such important speakers as Horace Mann, Horace Greeley and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The city- sponsored library began in 1878 when the state legislature authorized Milwaukee to establish a public library. At that time, it took over the association's rented quarters and the group's collection of 10,000 volumes, many in German. After several moves and several fires, the library moved into a new, block-long limestone building at what is now 814 W. Wisconsin Avenue.Still, Bayrd.(1948). Milwaukee: The History of a City. Madison: State Historical Society of Wisconsin. That building, which opened on Oct. 3, 1898, was shared with the Milwaukee Public Museum until the museum moved to its own building on West Wells Street in the mid-1960s. In 1929 when it still shared the space with the museum, the Library was home to a lion named Simba, who lived in the taxidermy department on the fourth floor. Simba \\"The Library Lion\\" was also known to play on the roof.\\"Milwaukee's Menagerie: Sim the Library Lion\\" http://mpl.org/blog/now/milwaukee-s-menagerie-sim-the-library- lion Retrieved 2016-9-10 In 1957, an addition to the Central Library building was opened on the Wells Street side. It included four fireproof levels of shelving below ground level. The library system expanded by establishing book depositories at locations around the city, first in grocery stores, then in rented store buildings. On June 16, 1910, the South Division branch opened in its own building at what is now 931 W. Madison Street. In the 1960s the library system began a program to replace the storefront libraries and the outdated South Division branch and build new branch buildings throughout the city. Today there are 12 neighborhood libraries, each of which serves a population of about 50,000.Kamps, Mary. (1993). The Wonders Within: The Milwaukee Public Library. Reiman Publications. The most recently built branch library is the East Library, which re-opened in a new building to the public on November 22, 2014. Since then, Milwaukee Public Library has completely remodeled the Tippecanoe neighborhood branch in 2015 and opened the Mitchell Street branch on October 7, 2017 in the historic Hills Building on the city's near-south side. The Mitchell Street branch replaces the Forest Home branch, which closed permanently in September 2017. Central Library The Central Library is the headquarters for the Milwaukee Public Library System and also houses the administrative offices of the Milwaukee County Federated Library System. Designated a Milwaukee Landmark in 1969, the building remains one of Milwaukee's most monumental public structures. Today, the Central Library occupies almost the entire building with 3 exceptions: the headquarters for the Milwaukee County Federated Library System; the Wisconsin Talking Book and Braille Library; and Audio & Braille Literacy Enhancement.

The mansion has been a state museum since 1960. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975.. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, David Davis Mansion was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). Set in a residential neighborhood on Bloomington's near-south-side, the three-story yellow brick mansion comprises 36 rooms in an Italianate villa style. The mansion's lot includes an 1872 wood house, a barn and stable, privies, a foaling shed, carriage barn, and a flower and ornamental cutting garden. \\"Sarah's Garden\\", the Victorian cut flower garden, with original heirloom roses and perennials began restoration in 2001. History Inside Clover Lawn National Historic Landmark.Clover Lawn was built between 1870 and 1872 and is where Justice Davis lived until his death in 1886. Davis commissioned French-born architect Alfred H. Piquenard to design the mansion, which combines Italianate and Second Empire architectural features and is a model of mid-Victorian style and taste. Piquenard was a prominent Midwest architect who designed the State Capitol in Springfield. The home was meant as a residence for Davis' wife, Sarah. David Davis himself spent most of his time there after his retirement from the U.S. Senate in 1883. The house remained in the Davis family until 1960, when it was donated to the state of Illinois, which operates it as a state historic site.

It was written by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. It is the first track on Aerosmith's hard rock album Rocks released in 1976. The song was also released as the third single from the album in 1977. It peaked at #38 on the Billboard Hot 100. Background The song's main riff was written by Joe Perry on a Fender Bass VI, which gives the song its distinctive \\"growl\\". Brad Whitford plays the lead guitar part. \\"Back in the Saddle\\" also features one of the heaviest and most noticeable bass lines by Tom Hamilton. The song is also notable for the slow buildup of the drum beat and guitar riff in the beginning of the song, as well as the sound effects of a galloping horse and whips, and screams and yodeling by Steven Tyler at the end of the song. A real bullwhip was intended to be used for the whip effects and hours were spent trying to get it to crack. The band members ended up cut up and hurt without making any progress. Eventually, the band decided the whip effects would be created by whirling a 30-foot cord from the studio, then by firing a cap gun to create the crack of the whip (the sound effects are more prominent in the Quadraphonic mix of the album (Columbia CAQ 34165)). When the song is performed in concert, Tyler often makes more noticeable lyrical and visible references to sex. Although the lyrics, by Tyler, were written with the simple idea of cowboys and sex, this song took on new meaning after Aerosmith reunited in 1984 and embarked on their Back in the Saddle Tour. Today, the song remains a staple on classic rock radio and in concert. It is arguably one of the heaviest songs of Aerosmith's Top 40 singles, and is cited by rock musicians Slash and James Hetfield as among their favorite rock songs. The \\"saddle\\" Tyler refers to in the song is metaphorical to several sexual positions. Cover versions Sebastian Bach covered the song on his 2007 solo album Angel Down as a duet with Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose. Mark Slaughter, Albert Lee, Rudy Sarzo and Frankie Banali covered the song for the Aerosmith tribute album Not the Same Old Song and Dance (Eagle Records, 1999). Additional guitars were by the album's producers, Bob Kulick and Bruce Bouillet. In other media *In February 2009, Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-VA) used Aerosmith's \\"Back in the Saddle\\" to boast in an ad that \\"The House GOP is back\\" due to the party's unanimous opposition in the house to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. After Stage Three Music, which owns the rights to the song, asserted the use as copyright infringement, Cantor was forced to take down the ad.

The process is highly iterative - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary. It is a decision making process (often iterative) in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective. Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation. Common stages of the engineering design process It's important to understand that there are various framings/articulations of the engineering design process. Different terminology employed may have varying degrees of overlap, which affects what steps get stated explicitly or deemed \\"high level\\" versus subordinate in any given model. This, of course, applies as much to any particular example steps/sequences given here. One example framing of the engineering design process delineates the following stages: research, conceptualization, feasibility assessment, establishing design requirements, preliminary design, detailed design, production planning and tool design, and production.Ertas, A. & Jones, J. (1996). The Engineering Design Process. 2nd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Others, noting that \\"different authors (in both research literature and in textbooks) define different phases of the design process with varying activities occurring within them,\\" have suggested more simplified/generalized models - such as problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, and design communication.Dym, C.L. & Little, P. (2009). Engineering Design. 3rd ed. New York, N.Y., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Another summary of the process, from European engineering design literature, includes clarification of the task, conceptual design, embodiment design, detail design.Pahl, G. & Beitz, W. (1988). Engineering Design: a systematic approach. London, UK, The Design Council. (NOTE: In these examples, other key aspects - such as concept evaluation and prototyping - are subsets and/or extensions of one or more of the listed steps.) Research Various stages of the design process (and even earlier) can involve a significant amount of time spent on locating information and research.A.Eide, R.Jenison, L.Mashaw, L.Northup. Engineering: Fundamentals and Problem Solving. New York City: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.,2002 Consideration should be given to the existing applicable literature, problems and successes associated with existing solutions, costs, and marketplace needs. The source of information should be relevant. Reverse engineering can be an effective technique if other solutions are available on the market. Other sources of information include the Internet, local libraries, available government documents, personal organizations, trade journals, vendor catalogs and individual experts available. Design requirements Establishing design requirements and conducting requirement analysis, sometimes termed problem definition (or deemed a related activity), is one of the most important elements in the design process,Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., Mylopoulos, J., and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136. and this task is often performed at the same time as a feasibility analysis. The design requirements control the design of the product or process being developed, throughout the engineering design process. These include basic things like the functions, attributes, and specifications - determined after assessing user needs. Some design requirements include hardware and software parameters, maintainability, availability, and testability. Feasibility In some cases, a feasibility study is carried out after which schedules, resource plans and estimates for the next phase are developed. The feasibility study is an evaluation and analysis of the potential of a proposed project to support the process of decision making. It outlines and analyses alternatives or methods of achieving the desired outcome. The feasibility study helps to narrow the scope of the project to identify the best scenario. A feasibility report is generated following which Post Feasibility Review is performed. The purpose of a feasibility assessment is to determine whether the engineer's project can proceed into the design phase. This is based on two criteria: the project needs to be based on an achievable idea, and it needs to be within cost constraints. It is important to have engineers with experience and good judgment to be involved in this portion of the feasibility study. Concept Generation  A concept study (conceptualization, conceptual design) is often a phase of project planning that includes producing ideas and taking into account the pros and cons of implementing those ideas. This stage of a project is done to minimize the likelihood of error, manage costs, assess risks, and evaluate the potential success of the intended project. In any event, once an engineering issue or problem is defined, potential solutions must be identified. These solutions can be found by using ideation, the mental process by which ideas are generated. In fact, this step is often termed Ideation or \\"Concept Generation.\\" The following are widely used techniques: *trigger word - a word or phrase associated with the issue at hand is stated, and subsequent words and phrases are evoked. *morphological analysis - independent design characteristics are listed in a chart, and different engineering solutions are proposed for each solution. Normally, a preliminary sketch and short report accompany the morphological chart. *synectics - the engineer imagines him or herself as the item and asks, \\"What would I do if I were the system?\\" This unconventional method of thinking may find a solution to the problem at hand. The vital aspects of the conceptualization step is synthesis. Synthesis is the process of taking the element of the concept and arranging them in the proper way. Synthesis creative process is present in every design. *brainstorming - this popular method involves thinking of different ideas, typically as part of a small group, and adopting these ideas in some form as a solution to the problem Various generated ideas must then undergo a concept evaluation step, which utilizes various tools to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weakness of possible alternatives. Preliminary design The preliminary design, or high-level design includes (also called FEED or Basic design), often bridges a gap between design conception and detailed design, particularly in cases where the level of conceptualization achieved during ideation is not sufficient for full evaluation. So in this task, the overall system configuration is defined, and schematics, diagrams, and layouts of the project may provide early project configuration. (This notably varies a lot by field, industry, and product.) During detailed design and optimization, the parameters of the part being created will change, but the preliminary design focuses on creating the general framework to build the project on. S. Blanchard and J. Fabrycky describe it as: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòwhats‚Äô initiating conceptual design produce ‚Äòhows‚Äô from the conceptual design evaluation effort applied to feasible conceptual design concepts. Next, the ‚Äòhows‚Äô are taken into preliminary design through the means of allocated requirements. There they become ‚Äòwhats‚Äô and drive preliminary design to address ‚Äòhows‚Äô at this lower level.‚Äù Detailed design Following FEED is the Detailed Design (Detailed Engineering) phase, which may consist of procurement of materials as well. This phase further elaborates each aspect of the project/product by complete description through solid modeling, drawings as well as specifications. Computer-aided design (CAD) programs have made the detailed design phase more efficient. For example, a CAD program can provide optimization to reduce volume without hindering a part's quality. It can also calculate stress and displacement using the finite element method to determine stresses throughout the part. Widas, P. (1997, April 9). Introduction to finite element analysis. Retrieved from Production planning The production planning and tool design consists of planning how to mass-produce the product and which tools should be used in the manufacturing process. Tasks to complete in this step include selecting materials, selection of the production processes, determination of the sequence of operations, and selection of tools such as jigs, fixtures, metal cutting and metal or plastics forming tools. This task also involves additional prototype testing iterations to ensure the mass- produced version meets qualification testing standards. Comparison with the scientific method Engineering is formulating a problem that can be solved through design. Science is formulating a question that can be solved through investigation. The engineering design process bears some similarity to the scientific method. Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1997). The design process: properties, paradigms, and structure. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics-Part A: Systems and Humans, 27(2), 146-166. Braha, Dan; Maimon, Oded (1998). A Mathematical Theory of Design: Foundations, Algorithms, and Applications. Springer. Chapter 2. Both processes begin with existing knowledge, and gradually become more specific in the search for knowledge (in the case of \\"pure\\" or basic science) or a solution (in the case of \\"applied\\" science, such as engineering). The key difference between the engineering process and the scientific process is that the engineering process focuses on design, creativity and innovation while the scientific process emphasizes Discovery (observation).

Locust Lake State Park is located approximately north of Pottsville, south of Mahanoy City, west of Tamaqua and west of Tuscarora State Park. The lake is . The park offers hiking, camping, boating, fishing, swimming, biking, and a wide array of other seasonal activities.  History  The Locust Valley area was originally claimed by the Lenape. Their land was conquered by the Susquehannocks, then later controlled by New York Iroquios League of Five Nations. In the mid-19th century, settlers discovered anthracite coal in the area which led to thousands of immigrants swiftly arriving to the area to mine coal. Although the area was not suitable for coal mining, it did not escape the Industrial Revolution. The forest was quickly turned into a shrubbery area prone to flooding and fires after loggers turned the trees into lumber, shingles, tool handles, and other wood products. Tanneries used the white pine and hemlock bark for tanning leather. The forests were gone by the early 20th century, with some farmers clearing and tilling the land. After its purchase by the Marchalonis Brothers, Locust Lake became a fishing spot and picnicking area. While they were digging a lake, they found a dam with a water wheel under seven feet of debris and leaves. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the land from the Marchalonis Brothers in 1966. Locust Lake officially opened on June 10, 1972. Oldest brother, Bill, went on to create \\"Blue Mt. Lakes\\", in Schyukill Haven, Pa.  Recreation  Locust Lake Motor boats are allowed as long as you have a boat registration from any state. Non-powered boats may either have a boat registration from any state, or a launching or mooring permit from Pennsylvania State Parks. Boat rentals are available at a nominal fee. Locust Lake has 282 campsites divided into tent or trailer sites. The campsites encircle the lake. Fishing is permitted year round. The lake is stocked several times a year with brown and brook trout. Pickerel, bass (smallmouth and largemouth), and panfish are also caught year round. Ice fishing is permitted, but the ice is not monitored for safety. Swimming is permitted from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Since 2008, lifeguards are not posted at the beach. Swimming areas are marked with buoys, and the deepest area is . Hunting Approximately are available for hunting. Ruffed Grouse, woodcock, doves, Common pheasants, Eastern gray squirrels, wild turkeys, eastern cottontail rabbit, and white-tailed deer are common species and frequently spotted. Although there is ample room for hunting, it is restricted to designated areas of the park and surrounding state forest. A bow and arrow and flintlock muzzle loader only hunting area is located in the park. Hunting groundhogs is prohibited. Dog training is permitted from the day after Labor day until March 31 in designated hunting areas.

Madder lake contains two organic red dyes: alizarin and purpurin. As a paint, it has been described as a fugitive, transparent, nonstaining, mid valued, moderately dull violet red pigment in tints and medium solutions, darkening to an impermanent, dull magenta red in masstone. History Madder has been cultivated as a dyestuff since antiquity in Central Asia, South Asia, and Egypt, where it was grown as early as 1500 BC. Cloth dyed with madder root dye was found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun and on an Egyptian tomb painting from the Graeco-Roman period, diluted with gypsum to produce a pink color. It was also found in ancient Greece (in Corinth), and in Italy in the Baths of Titus and the ruins of Pompeii. It is referred to in the Talmud as well as mentioned in writings by Dioscorides (who referred to it as ·ºêœÅœÖŒ∏œÅœåŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒøŒΩ), Hippocrates, and other literary figures, and in artwork where it is referred to as rubio and used in paintings by J. M. W. Turner and as a color for ceramics. In Spain, madder was introduced and then cultivated by the Moors. The production of a lake pigment from madder seems to have been first invented by the ancient Egyptians. Several techniques and recipes developed. Ideal color was said to come from plants 18 to 28 months old that had been grown in calcareous soil, which is full of lime and typically chalky. Most were considered relatively weak and extremely fugitive until 1804, when the English dye maker George Field Field's notes are held at the Courtauld Institute of Art. See: http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=4107&inst;_id=2 (accessed: 2007/09/05) refined the technique of making a lake from madder by treating it with alum and an alkali. Winsor & Newton's madder pigment is still made according to his process. See http://www.winsornewton.com/artnews/EN/artnewsletterA4_english03_2002.pdf page 6. (accessed: 2007/09/03). Note that Henry Charles Newton, founder of Winsor Newton, was his assistant and friend. The resulting madder lake had a less fugitive color and could be used more efficaciously, for example by blending it into a paint. Over the following years, other metal salts, including those containing chromium, iron, and tin, were found to be usable in place of alum to give madder-based pigments of various other colors. In 1827, the French chemists Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Colin began producing garancine, the concentrated version of natural madder. They then found that madder lake contained two colorants, the red alizarin and the more rapidly fading purpurin. Purpurin is only present in the natural form of madder and gives a distinctive orange/red generally warmer tone that pure synthetic alizarin does not. Purpurin fluoresces yellow to red under ultraviolet light, while synthetic alizarin slightly shows violet. Alizarin was discovered before purpurin, by heating the ground madder with acid and potash. A yellow vapor crystallized into bright red needles: alizarin. This alizarin concentrate comprises only 1% of the madder root. Natural rose madder supplied half the world with red, until 1868, when its alizarin component became the first natural dye to be synthetically duplicated by Carl Gr√§be and Carl Liebermann. Advances in the understanding of chemistry, such as chemical structures, chemical formulas, and elemental formulas, aided these Berlin-based scientists in discovering that alizarin had an anthracene base. However, their recipe was not feasible for large-scale production; it required expensive and volatile substances, specifically bromine. William Perkin, the inventor of mauve, filed a patent in June 1869 for a new way to produce alizarin without bromine. Gr√§be, Liebermann, and Heinrich Caro filed a patent for a similar process just one day before Perkin did ‚Äì yet both patents were granted, as Perkin's had been sealed first. They divided the market in half: Perkin sold to the English market, and the scientists from Berlin to the United States and mainland Europe. Because this synthetic alizarin dye could be produced for a fraction of the cost of the natural madder dye, it quickly replaced all madder-based colorants then in use (in, for instance, British army red coats that had been a shade of madder from the late 17th century to 1870, and French military cloth, often called \\"Turkey Red\\"). In turn, alizarin itself has now been largely replaced by the more light-resistant quinacridone pigments originally developed at DuPont in 1958. It is still manufactured in traditional ways to meet the demands of the fine art market.

The show was created by Vinta Nanda, Piyush Gupta and Jatin Sethi and was produced by their production company Diamond Pictures.  Plot  The story mainly focus on Sneha, who is the youngest daughter-in-law of the Shah family; her battle is against her father-in-law Mansukh Lal Shah. Mansukh believes that men should be dominant over women at all times, where Sneha believes that both should have equal rights. Sneha is married to Pranav, who is very strong-minded and is a good son. Sneha is married in a joint family, which consists of a sweet, strong-minded but shy mother (Daya), a sweet and gentle natured daughter-in-law (Jyoti), a sweet smart gynecologist doctor turned housewife (Bhavna), a strong-minded son (Amar), a dedicated son (Manoj), a cool, modern son (Karan), a nosy aunt (Kanta Ben), an apprentice of an uncle (Bhagu Mamaji), two sweet little kids (Alisha and Bittu), a teenage daughter with big dreams (Hetal) and two loving but funny servants (Manjit and Santu). That is the Shah family, a Jain joint family living together in a male-dominated home. But with Sneha's arrival things start to go haywire. After Sneha is married, her bhabhis (sisters-in-law) Jyoti, Bhavna, and Daya challenge Sneha that she has to change her behavior and attitude in two months because their father-in-law is a very strict man with many rules that govern their lives. Sneha is determined to open the eyes of the other women of the house, but Mansukh (her father-in-law) is always two steps ahead of her. This show teaches how Sneha, a simple girl, tries to change her in-laws, especially the father-in-law's behavior and thoughts about women in general. And Sneha is successful in changing her father-in-law's thoughts after many ups and downs.  Cast  * Deepa Parab ... Sneha Shah * Amit Jain ... Pranav Shah *Arvind Rathod ...

It originally had a negative connotation in Mexico as it was used to describe anything lower class or impoverished, but was recontextualized by the Mexican and Chicano arts movement. The word was transformed to describe a specific artistic aesthetic, Rasquachismo, suited to overcoming material and professional limitations faced by artists in the movement. It is the \\"view of the underdog, which combines inventiveness with a survivalist attitude.\\" Background Rasquache art uses the most basic, simplest, quickest, and crudest means necessary to create the desired expression, in essence, creating the most from the least. The term can also be used to reference the bicultural inspiration from which these artists draw inspiration. Amalia Mesa-Bains, artist and writer, writes that \\"In rasquachismo, the irreverent and spontaneous are employed to make the most from the least... one has a stance that is both defiant and inventive. Aesthetic expression comes from discards, fragments, even recycled everyday materials... The capacity to hold life together with bits of string, old coffee cans, and broken mirrors in a dazzling gesture of aesthetic bravado is at the heart of rasquachismo.\\" When employed by female artists, she calls it Domesticana, but cautions that these terms should not be understood as applying to all Chicano artists. Making the most with the least is a statement of irreverence and is both \\"defiant and inventive.\\" Rasquache has non-artistic usage as well and can be used to mean \\"ghetto.\\" Behavior such as reusing plastic utensils and zip lock bags could be described as \\"rasquache.\\" Beyond being simply frugal, the rasquache philosophy also involves inventing new uses for conventional objects. This often means giving a new function to something that would conventionally be considered broken.

Plot House's ketamine treatment has worn off, and he has to diagnose Dr. Ezra Powell (played by Joel Grey), a 71-year-old renowned pioneer in the field of medical research who collapsed while studying cancer in lab rats. House puts Powell through diagnostic rigors, but the team is unable to come up with a conclusive diagnosis, and Powell's health continues to deteriorate. Becoming increasingly debilitated, Powell ultimately demands that the team stop the litany of medical tests and euthanize him. House strikes a deal with him and asks for one day to do tests on him. When House fails to diagnose Powell in one day, he visits him in his room to give him the lethal morphine dose. Instead of killing him, House puts Powell in a coma, so that he can do his diagnosis in peace. Cameron becomes disgusted with House for acting against the wish of the patient and for tricking him just so that House can solve his puzzle. House says to Cameron that you can either save a patient or you can let him die but you cannot do both. House also asks Cameron to read a medical journal which states that Dr.Ezra Powell had performed radiology treatment as an experiment on many babies without the consent of their parent. House notices that Powell has lost reflex capabilities in his right arm, and wakes Powell from his coma to find that Powell has also lost sensation in his abdomen and right leg. House ends up diagnosing Powell with amyloidosis and Chase finds that it is of sub-type AA, and therefore is a terminal illness. The following morning, Cuddy informs House that Powell died at 2:30 am, although had been declared stable at 2:00 am. House then goes to Cameron, who is crying in the hospital chapel, and tells her that he is proud of her indicating that Cameron had overcome her fear and helped to end the life of the patient according to his wish.

The launcher was placed atop the M4 Sherman, with its prominent vertical side frames anchored to the turret's sides, and fired a barrage of 4.5 in (114 mm) M8 rockets from 60 launch tubes. It was developed in 1943; small numbers were produced and were used by various US armor units in 1944‚Äì45. It adopts its name from the musical instrument \\"Calliope\\", also known as the steam organ, which had similar parallel or clustered pipes, and which had historically existed on steamboats of the Mississippi River in the United States, or as is more commonly known and associated with traditional \\"circus music\\". Variants Sherman Calliope tank in Italy, December 1944 * Rocket Launcher T34 (Calliope) ‚Äì Version carrying 60 4.5 in (114 mm) rockets in arrangement of a group of 36 tubes on the top, and a pair jettisonable groups of 12 tubes (24 tubes of jettisonable groups) on the bottom (Not jettisonable from M4A1 Sherman variant). A large support beam bolted to the left and right turret cheeks supported the weapon placed 1 meter above the turret. The rack was physically connected to the barrel of the M4‚Äôs 75mm gun using an arm. This arm was connected to the rack via a pivoting joint and clamped to the gun with a split ring. This allowed the missile launcher to follow the same elevation and depression arc of +25 to -12 Degrees. Each rocket was armed with a 4.5 inch (114 mm) fin-stabilized projectile armed with High-Explosive, and had a maximum range of 4200 yards (4 km) The range was increased to 5250 yards (5 km). The rockets were fired electronically using cables that were inserted through the commander's hatch. The 75mm main gun could not be fired once the rocket launcher has been attached. This caused the tank crews to modify the launcher's installation in the field, thereby allowing the main gun to fire albeit at a reduced elevation for the launcher . * Rocket Launcher T34E1 (Calliope) ‚Äì Same as T34 but groups of 12 jettisonable tubes replaced by groups of 14 tubes. * Rocket Launcher T34E2 (Calliope) ‚Äì Caliber of rockets increased from 4.5 in (114 mm) to 7.2 in (183 mm), number of tubes remains at 60. Saw combat in 1944‚Äì1945.  Service History  Although Calliopes were originally manufactured before D-Day and were envisioned for bunker-busting duties on the beaches, the proposal was dropped due to the tank's high center of gravity which makes its transportation unsteady. Thirty M4s of the 743rd Tank Battalion had the T34 launchers installed to assist a planned push by the 30th Infantry Division in December 1944. The German Ardennes offensive stopped this plan, and the launchers were subsequently removed. In 1945, it was used in various actions by the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th, and 14th Armored Divisions. Although seeing limited action, it was effective as a weapon for psychological warfare. The noise generated by launches was enough to scare enemy soldiers.

Many of them are now inseparable parts of everyday life, or simply common social etiquette, though they often have their origins in superstition. Awareness of them, and their perceived importance, depends on various factors including region and age. Some are extremely common and practiced by the vast majority of the population, while some are extremely obscure and could be more regionally Customs that are more often regarded as superstition *Hands that itch are an omen that one will come into wealth. *Mothers typically do not show their Baby to anyone except the boys, the midwife and other close relatives for forty eight hours after the baby is born. *Before leaving for a long journey, travelers and, all those who are seeing them off, must sit for a moment in silence before leaving the house. It is often conveniently written off as a time to sit and think of anything one may have forgotten. Another version of the superstition states that the traveler must sit for a moment on or beside their suitcase. *After someone has left the house on a long journey, their room and/or their things should not be cleaned up until they have arrived, or at least a day has passed if there are guests in a house. *Knocking on wood is practiced in Russia as in other countries. However Russians tend to add a symbolic three spits over one's left shoulder (or simply with the head turned to the left), and Russians will often knock three times as well. Traditionally one was spitting on the devil (who is always on the left). *Breaking a mirror is considered bad luck in Russia, as is looking at one's reflection in a broken mirror, but the effect is also more severe than 7 years of bad luck (as in American culture). *On examination day, it is bad luck to make your bed, wear anything new, or cut your fingernails. *It is bad luck to use physical hand gestures to demonstrate something negative using oneself or someone else as the object. For example, when describing a scar you saw on someone's face you should not gesture on your own face or someone else's. If you must, you can demonstrate in mid-air. If one does it without realizing, it can be countered by making a hand motion towards the body part used and then an abrupt motion away (as if to pick up the bad energy and throw it away) or by wiping the area with your hand and then blowing on your hand (as if to wipe off the bad energy and then blow it away). This is also a case where spitting over one's left shoulder may be used. *If one person accidentally steps on another person's foot, it is common for the person who was stepped on to lightly step on the foot of the person who stepped first. It is said that they thus avoid a future conflict. *Birthday parties should be celebrated on or after one's birthday, not before. So when one's birthday falls during the week, it's best to celebrate the following weekend. And never give someone birthday wishes before their birthday. *Talking about future success, especially boasting about it, is considered bad luck. It is considered better to be silent until the success has been achieved or to even sound pessimistic. *Returning home for forgotten things is a bad omen. It is better to leave it behind, but if returning is necessary, one should look in the mirror before leaving the house again. Otherwise the journey will be bad. *Many Russians consider giving gifts of sharp objects, like knives or scissors, to be taboo. This taboo may be avoided by the donor taking a symbolic payment, for example one Russian ruble, in exchange as if it is a trade, not a gift. *Birds that land on a windowsill should be chased away. If they tap on the window, or fly into it (open or closed) it is considered a very bad omen (often of death or just a loss of a leg or two). *If a chicken crows at you three times before noon, the death of a close family member can be expected within a fortnight. The chicken should be killed, but not eaten, as consuming it will bring about further misfortune. *Things bought for a newborn baby (such as clothes, toys, furniture, etc.) should only be purchased after the baby is born. This is usually done in a big hurry as a result. *It is often considered taboo to step over people, or parts of their body, who are on the ground. It is often said that it will prevent the person from growing (if they are not fully grown already). It is better to politely ask the person to move or to find a way around them. If one accidentally steps over a person (or people), it is sometimes standard to step backwards over them. *Unmarried people should not sit at the corner of the table. Otherwise they will not marry. This mostly applies to girls, and often only young girls. Sometimes it is said that the affected individual will not marry for 7 years, making it all right for young children to sit there. *When giving an animal as a gift (a cat, dog, bird, etc.), the receiver should give the giver a symbolic sum of money, for example one Russian ruble. *A purse (or any other money holder) as a gift requires a little money inside. Given empty it is said to cause bad financial luck. *A funeral procession brings good luck. But one should never cross its path or it is bad luck. *A woman with empty water buckets coming towards you is considered a bad omen. *A group of two or more people should not walk on different sides of a tree. They should all keep to one side or the other. *Bread should only be cut with a knife, not with your hands. Otherwise, it is said, that your life will be broken. The opposite is held true by some people. *Two or more people should never use one towel at the same time to dry their hands or bodies, or it is said to bring conflict. *A stranger should not look at a newborn baby before it is a certain age (between two months and one year). If one looks at the baby it is considered bad luck to compliment it. Instead, one could say, \\"Oh, what an ugly child!\\". *It's good luck to trip on your left foot. *One should never hand a knife directly to another person, as it is said that the two will get into a fight. Instead a person should always place the knife down on a surface, and only then can the other person pick it up. In several cases you can give it directly, but only pointing the sharp end to yourself and making the knife's handle accessible for the opposite person. *One is to never lick food off a knife. Doing so will make you a cruel person. * If one feels that he or she may have been cursed by someone (had the \\"evil eye\\" put on them) or just has the feeling of a hostile presence, it is recommended to remove one's coat and then put it back on starting with the hand opposing the usually used one. It is also recommended to pin a French Pin inside your clothing to avoid the curse of the evil eye in the first place. *One should not shake hands or give something through a threshold such as a door frame, window frame, or a state border. It is considered proper to either invite the person outside in or to step outside to shake hands if parting. *Whistling in a house would bring misfortune to that household (see origins below). *It is considered taboo to give something that is broken or has a defect as a gift. *Before one takes an exam, someone else would say, \\"–Ω–∏ –ø—É—Ö–∞ –Ω–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–∞!\\" which roughly translates to \\"neither fur, nor feather!\\" which means good luck. To this, the one taking the exam would reply, \\"–ö —á—ë—Ä—Ç—É!\\" which means, \\"Go to the Devil!\\" or \\"To the Devil!\\" which is a way of securing good luck. *If one walks underneath or ducks under the arm of another person, he or she must go back underneath that person's arm. Otherwise, they will never grow to their full height. Traditions for the use of alcohol in Russia *When you have alcohol, it must be drunk until it is gone. *One should not put a glass with alcohol back on the table. However it refers only to shot-type strong alcohol which you are supposed to drink at once. Wine, long drink cocktails and beer do not fall under the rule as they are meant to be sipped. *Traditionally alcohol is poured out to all the people present, though they are not required to drink. *One should not make a long interruption between first and second shots. *The latecomer must drink a full glass. (so-called \\"penalty\\") *Outgoing guest must drink last glass, so-called \\"na pososhok\\" (russ. \\"–ù–∞ –ø–æ—Å–æ—à–æ–∫\\"). Literally it is translated \\"On a small (walking) staff\\", really means \\"For lucky way\\". *As a rule, every portion of spirit is accompanied by a touch of glasses and a toast. Funeral and commemoration are exceptions; there the touch of glasses is forbidden. *It is not allowed to pour out by hand holding a bottle from below. *It is not allowed to fill a glass being held in the air. *It is considered bad luck to make a toast with an empty glass. If done, the toaster must finish off the bottle of what he had last. *It is considered bad luck to put an empty bottle back on the table when it's finished.Donaldson, Lloyd.

(2010) Russia. Lonely Planet. p. 109 \\"Cause and effect\\" Russian superstitions * If your ears or cheeks are hot, someone is thinking or talking about you (usually speaking ill). * If your nose itches, you'll be drinking soon. For children they might say, \\"You'll get hit in the nose\\". * If your right eye itches, you're going to be happy soon. If your left eye itches, you'll be sad. * If your lips itch, you'll be kissing someone soon. * If your right hand itches, you're going to get money soon. It sometimes means you're going to greet someone. If your left hand itches, you're going to give someone money. * If you have the hiccups, someone is remembering you at this moment. * If an eyelash falls out you'll receive a gift. If someone finds an eyelash on someone he or she will sometimes let the person blow it away and make a wish. * If a fork or spoon falls on the ground, expect a female guest. If a knife falls, expect a male guest. * If you eat from a knife, you'll be \\"angry like a dog\\". * If someone is not recognized when seen or heard, he or she will be rich. So if someone calls you on the phone and you don't recognize them you can cheer them up by telling them they'll be rich. * If someone was talking about you before you entered the room/conversation, then you will live a long and rich life. * If a cat is washing its face, expect guests soon. * If a black cat crosses your path, it's bad luck (though not unique to Russian tradition). People will often avoid crossing the place where it crossed, or will at least wait for someone else to cross it first. * If a hare crosses your path, it's bad luck. This is much less common than the cat superstition, which is understandable given the lack of hares in urban conditions. * If you spill salt, it's bad luck and is said to bring conflict, but no one will throw salt over their left shoulder. * If you step on a crack, it's bad luck. This one isn't very common, and Russians who do avoid cracks don't do it in an effort to save his or her mother's backs. * If it's raining when you leave a place, it means you'll return, and it is considered a generally good omen. * If it rains on someone's wedding, it means they'll be wealthy. * If someone sneezes while telling something, it means he or she is telling the truth. * If one or more birds defecate on you or your property (commonly cars), it's good luck, and may bring you riches. * If you find a bay leaf in your soup (commonly Borshch) while eating, it means you'll get mail from someone. * If you wear clothes (such as an undershirt) inside out, you will get beaten. Your friend should point this out, wait for you to fix the clothes and then punch you symbolically. * Lucky in cards not lucky in love. This, however, is only a pre-marital superstition. The reason for the division is that marriage is a sacrament in the Russian Orthodox Church, and this sacrament, ordained by God, eviscerates the pre-marital superstition. Thus, when a man is bonded by divine sacrament to a single woman whom he loves the cause and effect is reversed: namely, his married love for a single woman, and her love for him, will bring him good fortune in all endeavors including cards. * If you wear a shirt backwards, you will become acquainted with someone new. * In Russian superstition if a couple sets a wedding date and doesn't end up getting married on that date they can not set another date and should not get married as their union will be cursed. * Accidentally breaking a glass is considered good luck. * If one tripped on his or her left leg and was born on an odd- numbered day, or tripped on his or her right foot and born on an even-numbered day, one should ask someone else to slap his or her corresponding hand in order to negate the bad luck. * If you have ringing in one of your ears, ask someone which ear is ringing. If they guessed right, you should both make a wish. * If someone does something bad, a ghost may take a possession owned by the family. If the sinner repents, the ghost will return the item sometime during the week of his or her birthday. *If someone whistles inside a house, they will become financially irresponsible and lose money. * If you find yourself standing between people with identical names, you should make a wish and it will come true. Russia lacks some of the superstitions Westerners find commonplace. Most Russians are not particularly concerned with the number , opening umbrellas indoors or walking under ladders. Communion or hold conversations with demons. Sorcerers primarily use black magic to summon devils. The goals of summoning devils include attaining wealth, fame, approval of superiors, sex, or harming another person. Those that rejected Christianity and sought the Devil felt that the Devil was as strong as God and impious spells were more powerful than prayer.Elena B. Smilianksaia, \\"Witches, Blasphemers, and Heretics,\\" Russian Studies in History 45. 4 (2001). Love magic Romance was connected with magic and sorcery even until the 18th century when it became a prevalent literary theme. Neighbors suspected magic to be the cause of people so passionate they lost their senses. Christianity supported marriage and child-bearing, but it did not support the pursuit of pleasures of the flesh. This ban did not stop people from employing the Devil to get their share of pleasure. For men the usual aim was sex, but for women it could have been to get married, exact revenge, or regain a husband's affection. Death There are many interpretations of death in Russian folk tradition. It can be reversible, and it sometimes resides outside of the body. It is also closely related to sleep. It is believed that when one sleeps one can traverse the ‚Äúother world‚Äù and come back alive. There are two kinds of deaths. A person who dies in his or her old age surrounded by family died a ‚Äúgood‚Äù death, a death that was ‚Äútheir own.‚Äù They depart when God says they should. A person who dies a ‚Äúbad‚Äù death, or a death ‚Äúnot their own,‚Äù died too soon before the time God assigned them. These persons might have been murdered, committed suicide, died of illness, or in war. Because of the nature of these deaths the earth cannot accept them until their time comes which means they do not receive a proper burial and are sometimes not buried at all but covered with rocks or sticks. Russians associate ‚Äúgood‚Äù deaths with bringing good harvests while attributing storms, droughts and other forms of destruction to ‚Äúbad‚Äù deaths.Elizabeth A. Warner. Russian Myths. (Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2002.) Funeral rites Several steps must be taken once a person has died so their body can be buried and their soul can travel to the ‚Äúother world.‚Äù The first step is washing the body. In a Dual-Faith setting (in which Orthodoxy and folk tradition are combined) this ritual prepares the deceased's for his or her meeting with God. They then dress the body in all-white, handmade clothing left slightly unfinished because it belongs not in this world but the ‚Äúother world.‚Äù In Christianity, the white clothing worn by the corpse represents the pure life the deceased promised to live when he or she was baptized.Elizabeth A. Warner, ‚ÄúRussian Peasant Beliefs and Practices Concerning Death and the Supernatural Collected in Novosokol'niki Region, Pskov Province, Russia, 1995. Part II: Death in Natural Circumstances,\\" Folklore 111. 2 (2000): 255-281. The body must wear a belt during its burial because the deceased will need it when he or she is resurrected during the Last Judgment. Belts are significant in both Christian and folk rituals. Christians value them babies receive them, along with a cross, at their christening. Thus, it symbolizes a person's commitment to Christianity. In folk tradition, belts mark out an individual's private space and prove that he or she is a member of society and protect the wearer from dark forces. After washing and dressing the body, the body is laid out in the house for three days before it is put it in the coffin. Orthodox households and Old Belief (pre-1650 Orthodoxy) households perform this ritual slightly differently. Orthodox families lay their dead loved one so his or her head points towards the icon corner. In the houses of Old Believers the feet are placed closer to the icon corner so the deceased faces the corner and can pray if he or she desires. Old Believers believe that the dead can still feel for a time after their death. For fear of waking the newly dead, mourning does not begin during the washing or dressing. Inappropriate funeral etiquette can also wake the dead.Elizabeth A. Warner. Russian Myths. (Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press, 2002). The coffin, sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúnew living room,‚Äù is very comfortable, made like a bed with a pillow stuffed with birch bark or wood shavings. Mourners place objects in the coffin that the body might need after death such as money, food, favorite belongings, and reflections of status or occupation. Traditionally, men carry the coffin on their backs to the cemetery where the funeral will take place. At the funeral, a priest performs the ‚Äúseeing off‚Äù ceremony, praying over the body and allowing mourners to throw dirt on the grave, symbolically incorporating the corpse into the earth. The priest then places a paper crown on the head of the deceased and the mourners throw soil and coins into the grave (the coins are either to pay for transit to the ‚Äúother world‚Äù or for the space in the cemetery). After the funeral, mourners sing laments depicting the deceased leaving his or her family and the soul departing from the body. Also it is important to throw away any handkerchiefs used to wipe away tears at the funeral. You should under no circumstances bring it home at it is believed that if you do this you are bringing tears into the house. The soul Russian folk culture depicts the soul either as small and childlike, or having wings and flying. For forty days after a funeral, the soul of the deceased visits places it liked or places where it sinned to ask for forgiveness. After forty days the deceased's family sets a place for their loved one at dinner, inviting him or her join them for his or her own commemoration. When the family sees that the skin goes untouched they know their loved one has gone.

Although the beings of the unclean force resided primarily in the spirit realm (—Ç–æ—Ç —Å–≤–µ—Ç) they were able to manifest themselves in this world in many forms, the most well known included the domovoi, the leshy, the kikimora, the vodianoi and the rusalka.Cornwell, Neil. (2002) The Routledge Companion to Russian Literature. Routledge. p. 45 Also counted among the unclean force are sorcerers, witches, the undead, and the \\"unclean dead\\", including suicides, those who died of drunkenness, victims of accidents and violent deaths, unbaptized infants, and vampires. Likewise, strangers and people of other religions were viewed as possessing the unclean force.Morrissey, Susan K. (2012) Suicide and the Body Politic in Imperial Russia. Cambridge University. p. 232 Among these spirits, the domovoi was considered the least dangerous. If angered, the domovoi would act as a poltergeist. Other spirits, like the rusalka, were more malevolent. She was said to lure men to their watery deaths.Andrews, Tamra. (2000) Dictionary of Nature Myths: Legends of the Earth, Sea, and Sky. Oxford University. p. 165 Among the places where the unclean force was strongest against the Russian peasant were the crossroads, the threshold and the bathhouse. Spoiling Related to the unclean force was the superstitious belief in \\"spoiling\\" (–ø–æ—Ä—á–∞). One aligned with the unclean force could spoil another through the use of the evil eye or by means of a magical ritual. The spoiled person would be inflicted with such maladies and misfortunes as sickness, mental illness, deformity, loss of livelihood, and death.Bezrukova, V. S.

One type of spoiling was a form of hysteria called klikushestvo (–∫–ª–∏–∫—É—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ). It caused the bewitched person to shriek, curse, and fall to the floor when in the presence of religious objects or displays.

Ship history The ship was built by Harland & Wolff of Belfast, Northern Ireland, and was originally named Euripides when she sailed for the Aberdeen and Commonwealth Line. She was launched on 29 January 1914 and was 14,947 gross tons at the time and could make a top speed of 15 knots. Her shakedown cruise took place in June 1914, with her maiden voyage from London to Brisbane leaving on 1 July 1914. Two days after her arrival, she was taken over for Australian troop transport; the following year she returned to the UK-Australia run, but would continue transporting Australian troops through 1919, when she was overhauled at Belfast. In 1929, the Euripides was transferred to the White Star Line, and in 1932 was again transferred, this time to the Shaw, Savill & Albion Line. The company had her re-fitted to 15,128 gross tons, and renamed the ship Akaroa, sailing her from Southampton, England to Wellington, New Zealand by way of the Panama Canal. The round journey could be taken for ¬£112. On 1 September 1939, two days before the declaration of war, under Captain William Horatio Hartman, she set sail for Auckland, arriving on 8 October. The voyage was an epic one and the passengers presented the Captain with a silver salver in memory of, \\"an epic and perilous voyage\\". Captain Hartmann was awarded the OBE in 1943. In 1945 she was again re-fitted, and continued the UK-NZ run. Finally, in May 1954, she was sent to the breakers at Antwerp. Her scrap value was ¬£130,000.

The ship was laid down in 1865 at the Thames Ironworks shipyard in London, originally under the name Fatih for the Ottoman Empire. She was purchased by Prussia in February 1867, launched in April 1868, and commissioned into the Prussian Navy in February 1869. The ship was the fifth ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy, after , , , and . She was built as an armored frigate, armed with a main battery of sixteen and five guns; several smaller guns and torpedo tubes were added later in her career. The ship was for a time the largest and most powerful warship in the German navy; she served as its flagship during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870‚Äì1871, though engine troubles prevented the ship from seeing action. In 1878, the ship accidentally rammed and sank the ironclad , with great loss of life. K√∂nig Wilhelm was converted into an armored cruiser in 1895‚Äì1896; by early 1904, however, she had been superseded by newer vessels. In May of that year, she was placed out of active service and used as a floating barracks and training ship, a role she held through World War I. In 1921, the ship was ultimately broken up for scrap, after a career spanning 52 years and three German states.  Design  The ship had originally been ordered by the Ottoman Empire under the name Fatih from the Thames Ironworks shipyard in London, England in 1865. The vessel was built to a design created by the British naval architect Edward Reed, and at the time it was regarded in the press to be the most powerful vessel in the world. Some larger than the contemporary British ironclad , she also carried a larger gun battery. But owing to the Ottoman inability to pay for the vessel, the builder placed the still-incomplete vessel for sale the following year. The Kingdom of Prussia had embarked on a program to acquire sea-going ironclad warships, and after having placed orders for two such vessels in British and French shipyards in 1865, opted to add Fatih to the Prussian Navy when the opportunity arose. The small Prussian fleet had been unable to defeat the Danish naval blockade in the Second Schleswig War of 1863‚Äì1864, and sought to strengthen its fleet with ironclads to prevent future blockades. On entering service, the ship was the largest and most powerful vessel in the Prussian fleet, and served as its flagship. Indeed, K√∂nig Wilhelm remained the largest German vessel until 1891. This was in part due to the fact that Germany laid down only one small ironclad between 1876 and 1888; the four s, launched in 1891 and 1892, were the first ships to surpass K√∂nig Wilhelm in size.  General characteristics and machinery  Line-drawing of SMS K√∂nig Wilhelm K√∂nig Wilhelm was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading, and up to with a combat load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames. It contained eleven watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 70 percent of the length of the vessel. K√∂nig Wilhelm was noted by the German navy as having had \\"satisfactory sea-keeping qualities\\"; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She suffered from severe roll but little pitch. The ship's crew numbered 36 officers and 694 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff composed of 9 officers and 47 enlisted men. K√∂nig Wilhelm carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy. A horizontal two-cylinder single expansion steam engine, built by Maudslay, Son & Field of London, powered the ship. It drove a four-bladed screw in diameter. J Penn & Sons of Greenwich built eight trunk boilers for the ship. These were divided into two boiler rooms with twenty fireboxes in each, supplied steam to the engine at . The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials K√∂nig Wilhelm managed to make and . The ship carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . A ship rig with a surface area of supplemented the steam engine, though in service they added little to the ship's performance. Steering was controlled with a single rudder.  Armament and armor  As built, K√∂nig Wilhelm was equipped with thirty-three rifled 72-pounder cannon. After her delivery to Germany, these guns were replaced with eighteen L/20 guns, supplied with a total of 1,440 rounds of ammunition. These guns were mounted in a central battery, with nine on either broadside. The guns could depress to ‚àí4¬∞ and elevate to 7.5¬∞; at maximum elevation, the guns could reach targets out to . The ship's armament was rounded out by five guns, which could depress to ‚àí5¬∞ and elevate to 13¬∞. Their maximum range was . K√∂nig Wilhelm after the 1895‚Äì1896 reconstruction into an armored cruiser K√∂nig Wilhelm was reconstructed into an armored cruiser in 1895‚Äì1896 and rearmed with twenty-two 24 cm L/20 guns, a single L/30 gun with 109 rounds mounted in the stern, and eighteen quick-firing guns on the upper deck, nine on each broadside. The 15 cm gun had a range of . Five torpedo tubes were also installed; two were placed in the bow, one on both broadsides, and one in the stern, all above water. The torpedo tubes were supplied with a total of 13 rounds. Following her conversion into a training ship, most of her armament was removed. The ship only carried sixteen 8.8 cm L/30 guns, and in 1915, twelve of these were removed. As built, the ship was protected by wrought iron plating mounted over teak backing. Protection at the waterline was thickest amidships, with an outer layer of iron armor thick, an inner layer of thick iron, and of teak behind the iron. The outer layer was reduced to in the stern but did not extend to the bow. The inner layer was thick in both the bow and stern, and the teak backing was for both ends of the ship. The main battery was protected with thick plating and capped on either end with 150 mm thick transverse bulkheads. During her reconstruction into an armored cruiser, the iron armor was cut away and replaced with stronger steel armor. The conning tower received armor protection during the refit as well. The sides were thick sloped plates, with a thick roof.  Service history  The ship was laid down in 1865 and the Prussians purchased her on 6 February 1867, initially renaming her Wilhelm I. They changed her name again to K√∂nig Wilhelm on 14 December, and she was launched on 25 April 1868. After completing fitting-out, she was commissioned less than a year later, on 20 February 1869. The ship's first commander was Kapit√§n zur See Ludwig von Henk. Shortly after entering service, she joined the ironclads and for training exercises in August and September.  Franco-Prussian War  In May 1870, K√∂nig Wilhelm, Kronprinz, and Friedrich Carl were joined by the ironclad ram for a visit to Britain, though Friedrich Carl was damaged after running aground in the Great Belt. K√∂nig Wilhelm, Kronprinz, and Prinz Adalbert continued on to Plymouth while Friedrich Carl returned to Kiel for repairs. The latter vessel quickly rejoined the ships there and on 1 July they departed for a training cruise to Fayal in the Azores, Portugal. But tensions with France over the Hohenzollern candidacy for the vacant Spanish throne were reaching a crisis point. While they cruised east through the English Channel, they learned of the increasing likelihood of war, and the Prussians detached Prinz Adalbert to Dartmouth to be kept informed of events. The rest of the squadron joined her there on 13 July, and as war seemed to be imminent, the Prussians ended the cruise and returned to home. The ships arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 16 July, three days before France declared war on Prussia over the Ems Dispatch, initiating the Franco-Prussian War. The greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy. Kronprinz, Friedrich Carl, and K√∂nig Wilhelm were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven, with a view toward breaking the French blockade of the port. They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship , which had been stationed in Kiel. Despite the great French naval superiority, the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. K√∂nig Wilhelm and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. K√∂nig Wilhelm, Friedrich Carl, and Kronprinz stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict, while Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France. Peacetime operations in the 1870s After the war, the Prussian Navy became the Imperial Navy, and resumed its peacetime training routines. General Albrecht von Stosch became the chief of the Imperial Navy, and organized the fleet for coastal defense. Through the early 1870s, K√∂nig Wilhelm and the other armored frigates operated intermittently, alternating between periods of training activity and stints in reserve. Typically, the ships were commissioned for summer training cycles before being laid up over the winter, with one or two ironclads kept in commission but with reduced crews to serve as guard ships. For the 1875 training year, K√∂nig Wilhelm cruised with Kronprinz and the recently completed ironclads and , though they stayed in local waters. K√∂nig Wilhelm remained laid up through 1876 and 1877. K√∂nig Wilhelm collides with Grosser Kurf√ºrst K√∂nig Wilhelm was recommissioned in early 1878 to take part in that year's training program. While steaming in the Straits of Dover on 31 May, K√∂nig Wilhelm accidentally collided with the newly commissioned turret ironclad . The two ships, along with , had left Wilhelmshaven on the 29th. K√∂nig Wilhelm and Preussen steamed in a line, with Grosser Kurf√ºrst off to starboard. On the morning of the 31st, the three ships encountered a pair of sailing vessels off Folkestone. Grosser Kurf√ºrst turned to port to avoid the boats while K√∂nig Wilhelm sought to pass the two boats, but there was not enough distance between her and Grosser Kurf√ºrst. She therefore turned hard to port to avoid Grosser Kurf√ºrst, but the action was not taken quickly enough, and K√∂nig Wilhelm found herself pointed directly at Grosser Kurf√ºrst. K√∂nig Wilhelms ram bow tore a hole in Grosser Kurf√ºrst. A failure to adequately seal the watertight bulkheads aboard Grosser Kurf√ºrst caused the ship to sink rapidly, in the span of about eight minutes. Out of a crew of 500 men, 269 died in the accident. K√∂nig Wilhelm was also badly damaged in the collision, with severe flooding forward. K√∂nig Wilhelms captain initially planned on beaching the ship to prevent it from sinking, but determined that the ship's pumps could hold the flooding to an acceptable level. The ship made for Portsmouth, where temporary repairs could be effected to allow the ship to return to Germany. In the aftermath of the collision, the German navy held a court martial for Rear Admiral Batsch, the squadron commander, and Captains Monts and Kuehne, the commanders of the two ships, along with Lieutenant Clausa, the first officer aboard Grosser Kurf√ºrst, to investigate the sinking. The damage to K√∂nig Wilhelm necessitated a lengthy period of repairs from 1878 to 1882. The work was carried out at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, and also included reboilering and replacement of the ship's ram. Her 21 cm guns were replaced with 24 cm guns, providing the ship with a uniform gun battery.  Later service  K√∂nig Wilhelm as a training ship Torpedo nets were fitted to the ship from 1885 to 1897. K√∂nig Wilhelm returned to service in 1887 to participate in the ceremonies marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, which was to link the Kiel with the North Sea. She remained in commission for the summer training exercises, serving with I Division of the fleet. The ship participated in the 1888 training cycle as well, along with Kaiser and the ironclads and . She did not see activity from 1889 to late 1892, but she was reactivated to take part in the training cruise of the winter of 1892‚Äì1893. By 1893, K√∂nig Wilhelm had been assigned as the flagship for II Division of the German fleet; the four armored corvettes composed I Division. The ship flew the flag of Admiral Otto von Diederichs, and was based in Wilhelmshaven. On 20 February 1894, a special ceremony was held on board the ship to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her commissioning. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the ceremony, as did Ludwig von Henk, who had by that time retired as a Vizeadmiral. In April 1894, II Division conducted a training cruise to prepare for the annual summer maneuvers. During the cruise, K√∂nig Wilhelm ran aground on a mud bank off the Frisian coast. and quickly pulled the ship free with minimal damage. The ships then proceeded to Scotland via Oslo and Bergen. The division returned to Kiel at the end of May to replenish its stocks of coal and provisions for the summer exercises. During the 1894 maneuvers, von Diederich's II Division acted as the opposing force in the Baltic, simulating a Russian fleet attacking Germany's Baltic coast. Following the conclusion of maneuvers in September, Diederichs left the squadron and was replaced by Admiral Karl Barandon. In 1895, K√∂nig Wilhelm went into drydock at the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg for an extensive reconstruction into an armored cruiser. The vessel's armament was increased, the ship rig was removed, and new fighting masts were installed in place of the old masts. The ship's crew was dramatically increased, to 38 officers and 1,120 enlisted men. Work lasted through 1896, and the ship was returned to the fleet in her new guise on 25 January 1897. On 26 June, she represented Germany at the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. She served with the fleet until 1904, when she was removed from active duty. Starting on 3 May 1904, she became a harbor ship. She was then used as barracks ship and training vessel for naval cadets, based in Kiel, starting on 1 October 1907. Two years later, K√∂nig Wilhelm was moved to the Naval Academy at M√ºrwik, where she continued in these duties. Starting in 1910, the old corvette served as a support vessel for the ship. The light cruiser replaced Charlotte as K√∂nig Wilhelms auxiliary vessel in 1917. K√∂nig Wilhelm served through World War I, until 1921, after Germany's defeat. On 4 January 1921, the ship was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in R√∂nnebeck.

After his retirement he headed two commissions inquiring into the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots and the Godhra riots. Early life Judge Nanavati was the eldest of twelve children born to a family of professionals. In his family, his father, grandfather and uncle were all lawyers. Judge Nanavati studied at St. Xaviers College in Mumbai. After finishing his education in the arts, he enrolled in the Government Law College in Mumbai to receive his bachelor's and master's degrees in law. Career Mr. G.T. Nanavati enrolled as an advocate in the Bombay High Court in 1958. Circumstances forced him to return to Gujarat from Mumbai when the bifurcation of the Bombay state in 1960 left him a hard choice. His wish to practice at the prestigious Bombay High Court went unfulfilled and left for Ahmedabad. His practice in Ahmedabad was very low key. He dealt with a smattering of revenue cases, but his true potential was realized when he began to practice criminal cases. He received and accepted an offer to become a public prosecutor in 1964, which became a turning point in the young man's career. At that time, high court judges, not the government, appointed prosecutors. This began a fifteen-year stint prosecuting cases before the high court. He was appointed a permanent judge to the Gujarat High Court in 1979. Fourteen years later he was transferred to the high court in Orissa. A year later, in 1994, he was appointed chief justice of the High Court of Orissa. He was transferred again eight months later to the Karnataka High Court. In March 1995 he was appointed as a judge to the Supreme Court of India by the Congress government. Judge Nanavati retired on 16 February 2000. Nanavati Commission Nanavati was appointed by the National Democratic Alliance government to probe the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots. He was the sole member of the Nanavati commission. The commission incriminated Indian National Congress politicians Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler. Nanavati has stated that evidence indicated that it was a \\"lapse on part of the civil administration\\" not to call the Indian Army in a timely fashion, \\"resulting in large-scale rioting and loss of lives\\". Godhra riots In March 2002, Judge Nanavati was appointed to head a two-man commission investigating the 2002 Godhra riots, replacing Judge K. G. Shah. Throughout the proceedings and in its final report of November 2014, the commission concluded that there had been no serious lapses by either the police, nor the state administration in dealing with the riots. The report itself has yet to be made public.

In chemistry, the history of molecular theory traces the origins of the concept or idea of the existence of strong chemical bonds between two or more atoms. The modern concept of molecules can be traced back towards pre-scientific and Greek philosophers such as Leucippus and Democritus who argued that all the universe is composed of atoms and voids. Circa 450 BC Empedocles imagined fundamental elements (fire (20px), earth (20px), air (20px), and water (20px)) and \\"forces\\" of attraction and repulsion allowing the elements to interact. Prior to this, Heraclitus had claimed that fire or change was fundamental to our existence, created through the combination of opposite properties. In the Timaeus, Plato, following Pythagoras, considered mathematical entities such as number, point, line and triangle as the fundamental building blocks or elements of this ephemeral world, and considered the four elements of fire, air, water and earth as states of substances through which the true mathematical principles or elements would pass. A fifth element, the incorruptible quintessence aether, was considered to be the fundamental building block of the heavenly bodies. The viewpoint of Leucippus and Empedocles, along with the aether, was accepted by Aristotle and passed to medieval and renaissance Europe. A modern conceptualization of molecules began to develop in the 19th century along with experimental evidence for pure chemical elements and how individual atoms of different chemical substances such as hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form chemically stable molecules such as water molecules. 17th century The earliest views on the shapes and connectivity of atoms was that proposed by Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus who reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded to the shape of the atoms involved. Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. It was Democritus that was the main proponent of this view. Using analogies based on the experiences of the senses, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with hooks and eyes others with balls and sockets (see diagram).See testimonia DK 68 A 80, DK 68 A 37 and DK 68 A 43. See also A water molecule as hook-and- eye model might have represented it. Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius and Gassendi adhered to such conception. Note that the composition of water was not known before Avogadro (c. 1811). With the rise of scholasticism and the decline of the Roman Empire, the atomic theory was abandoned for many ages in favor of the various four element theories and later alchemical theories. The 17th century, however, saw a resurgence in the atomic theory primarily through the works of Gassendi, and Newton. Among other scientists of that time Gassendi deeply studied ancient history, wrote major works about Epicurus natural philosophy and was a persuasive propagandist of it. He reasoned that to account for the size and shape of atoms moving in a void could account for the properties of matter. Heat was due to small, round atoms; cold, to pyramidal atoms with sharp points, which accounted for the pricking sensation of severe cold; and solids were held together by interlacing hooks. Newton, though he acknowledged the various atom attachment theories in vogue at the time, i.e. \\"hooked atoms\\", \\"glued atoms\\" (bodies at rest), and the \\"stick together by conspiring motions\\" theory, rather believed, as famously stated in \\"Query 31\\" of his 1704 Opticks, that particles attract one another by some force, which \\"in immediate contact is extremely strong, at small distances performs the chemical operations, and reaches not far from particles with any sensible effect.\\" (a) Isaac Newton, (1704). Opticks. (pg. 389). New York: Dover. (b) In a more concrete manner, however, the concept of aggregates or units of bonded atoms, i.e. \\"molecules\\", traces its origins to Robert Boyle's 1661 hypothesis, in his famous treatise The Sceptical Chymist, that matter is composed of clusters of particles and that chemical change results from the rearrangement of the clusters. Boyle argued that matter's basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called \\"corpuscles\\", which were capable of arranging themselves into groups. In 1680, using the corpuscular theory as a basis, French chemist Nicolas Lemery stipulated that the acidity of any substance consisted in its pointed particles, while alkalis were endowed with pores of various sizes.Lemery, Nicolas. (1680). An Appendix to a Course of Chymistry. London, pgs 14-15. A molecule, according to this view, consisted of corpuscles united through a geometric locking of points and pores. 18th century √âtienne Fran√ßois Geoffroy‚Äôs 1718 Affinity Table: at the head of the column is a substance with which all the substances below can combine. An early precursor to the idea of bonded \\"combinations of atoms\\", was the theory of \\"combination via chemical affinity\\". For example, in 1718, building on Boyle's conception of combinations of clusters, the French chemist √âtienne Fran√ßois Geoffroy developed theories of chemical affinity to explain combinations of particles, reasoning that a certain alchemical \\"force\\" draws certain alchemical components together. Geoffroy's name is best known in connection with his tables of \\"affinities\\" (tables des rapports), which he presented to the French Academy in 1718 and 1720. These were lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different reagents. These tables retained their vogue for the rest of the century, until displaced by the profounder conceptions introduced by CL Berthollet. In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published Hydrodynamica, which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli positioned the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic. In 1789, William Higgins published views on what he called combinations of \\"ultimate\\" particles, which foreshadowed the concept of valency bonds. If, for example, according to Higgins, the force between the ultimate particle of oxygen and the ultimate particle of nitrogen were 6, then the strength of the force would be divided accordingly, and similarly for the other combinations of ultimate particles: William Higgins' combinations of ultimate particles (1789) 19th century John Dalton's union of atoms combined in ratios (1808) Similar to these views, in 1803 John Dalton took the atomic weight of hydrogen, the lightest element, as unity, and determined, for example, that the ratio for nitrous anhydride was 2 to 3 which gives the formula N2O3. Dalton incorrectly imagined that atoms \\"hooked\\" together to form molecules. Later, in 1808, Dalton published his famous diagram of combined \\"atoms\\": Amedeo Avogadro created the word \\"molecule\\". His 1811 paper \\"Essay on Determining the Relative Masses of the Elementary Molecules of Bodies\\", he essentially states, i.e. according to Partington's A Short History of Chemistry, that: Note that this quote is not a literal translation. Avogadro uses the name \\"molecule\\" for both atoms and molecules. Specifically, he uses the name \\"elementary molecule\\" when referring to atoms and to complicate the matter also speaks of \\"compound molecules\\" and \\"composite molecules\\". During his stay in Vercelli, Avogadro wrote a concise note (memoria) in which he declared the hypothesis of what we now call Avogadro's law: equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. This law implies that the relationship occurring between the weights of same volumes of different gases, at the same temperature and pressure, corresponds to the relationship between respective molecular weights. Hence, relative molecular masses could now be calculated from the masses of gas samples. Avogadro developed this hypothesis in order to reconcile Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac's 1808 law on volumes and combining gases with Dalton's 1803 atomic theory. The greatest difficulty Avogadro had to resolve was the huge confusion at that time regarding atoms and molecules‚Äîone of the most important contributions of Avogadro's work was clearly distinguishing one from the other, admitting that simple particles too could be composed of molecules, and that these are composed of atoms. Dalton, by contrast, did not consider this possibility. Curiously, Avogadro considers only molecules containing even numbers of atoms; he does not say why odd numbers are left out. In 1826, building on the work of Avogadro, the French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas states: In coordination with these concepts, in 1833 the French chemist Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin presented a clear account of Avogadro's hypothesis, regarding atomic weights, by making use of \\"volume diagrams\\", which clearly show both semi-correct molecular geometries, such as a linear water molecule, and correct molecular formulas, such as H2O: Marc Antoine Auguste Gaudin's volume diagrams of molecules in the gas phase (1833) In two papers outlining his \\"theory of atomicity of the elements\\" (1857‚Äì58), Friedrich August Kekul√© was the first to offer a theory of how every atom in an organic molecule was bonded to every other atom. He proposed that carbon atoms were tetravalent, and could bond to themselves to form the carbon skeletons of organic molecules. In 1856, Scottish chemist Archibald Couper began research on the bromination of benzene at the laboratory of Charles Wurtz in Paris.Chemical Bonding Concepts ‚Äì Oklahoma State University One month after Kekul√©'s second paper appeared, Couper's independent and largely identical theory of molecular structure was published. He offered a very concrete idea of molecular structure, proposing that atoms joined to each other like modern-day Tinkertoys in specific three-dimensional structures. Couper was the first to use lines between atoms, in conjunction with the older method of using brackets, to represent bonds, and also postulated straight chains of atoms as the structures of some molecules, ring-shaped molecules of others, such as in tartaric acid and cyanuric acid. In later publications, Couper's bonds were represented using straight dotted lines (although it is not known if this is the typesetter's preference) such as with alcohol and oxalic acid below: Archibald Couper's molecular structures, for alcohol and oxalic acid, using elemental symbols for atoms and lines for bonds (1858) In 1861, an unknown Vienna high-school teacher named Joseph Loschmidt published, at his own expense, a booklet entitled Chemische Studien I, containing pioneering molecular images which showed both \\"ringed\\" structures as well as double-bonded structures, such as:Bader, A. & Parker, L. (2001). \\"Joseph Loschmidt\\", Physics Today, Mar. Joseph Loschmidt's molecule drawings of ethylene H2C=CH2 and acetylene HC‚â°CH (1861) Loschmidt also suggested a possible formula for benzene, but left the issue open. The first proposal of the modern structure for benzene was due to Kekul√©, in 1865. The cyclic nature of benzene was finally confirmed by the crystallographer Kathleen Lonsdale. Benzene presents a special problem in that, to account for all the bonds, there must be alternating double carbon bonds: Benzene molecule with alternating double bonds In 1865, German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann was the first to make stick-and-ball molecular models, which he used in lecture at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, such as methane shown below: Hofmann's 1865 stick-and-ball model of methane CH4. The basis of this model followed the earlier 1855 suggestion by his colleague William Odling that carbon is tetravalent. Hofmann's color scheme, to note, is still used to this day: nitrogen = blue, oxygen = red, chlorine = green, sulfur = yellow, hydrogen = white. The deficiencies in Hofmann's model were essentially geometric: carbon bonding was shown as planar, rather than tetrahedral, and the atoms were out of proportion, e.g. carbon was smaller in size than the hydrogen. In 1864, Scottish organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown began to draw pictures of molecules, in which he enclosed the symbols for atoms in circles, and used broken lines to connect the atoms together in a way that satisfied each atom's valence. The year 1873, by many accounts, was a seminal point in the history of the development of the concept of the \\"molecule\\". In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature.Maxwell, James Clerk, \\"Molecules \\". Nature, September, 1873. In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \\"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel independently proposed that the phenomenon of optical activity could be explained by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron. This led to a better understanding of the three-dimensional nature of molecules. Emil Fischer developed the Fischer projection technique for viewing 3-D molecules on a 2-D sheet of paper: 200px In 1898, Ludwig Boltzmann, in his Lectures on Gas Theory, used the theory of valence to explain the phenomenon of gas phase molecular dissociation, and in doing so drew one of the first rudimentary yet detailed atomic orbital overlap drawings. Noting first the known fact that molecular iodine vapor dissociates into atoms at higher temperatures, Boltzmann states that we must explain the existence of molecules composed of two atoms, the \\"double atom\\" as Boltzmann calls it, by an attractive force acting between the two atoms. Boltzmann states that this chemical attraction, owing to certain facts of chemical valence, must be associated with a relatively small region on the surface of the atom called the sensitive region. Boltzmann states that this \\"sensitive region\\" will lie on the surface of the atom, or may partially lie inside the atom, and will firmly be connected to it. Specifically, he states \\"only when two atoms are situated so that their sensitive regions are in contact, or partly overlap, will there be a chemical attraction between them. We then say that they are chemically bound to each other.\\" This picture is detailed below, showing the Œ±-sensitive region of atom-A overlapping with the Œ≤-sensitive region of atom-B: Boltzmann‚Äôs 1898 I2 molecule diagram showing atomic \\"sensitive region\\" (Œ±, Œ≤) overlap. 20th century In the early 20th century, the American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis began to use dots in lecture, while teaching undergraduates at Harvard, to represent the electrons around atoms. His students favored these drawings, which stimulated him in this direction. From these lectures, Lewis noted that elements with a certain number of electrons seemed to have a special stability. This phenomenon was pointed out by the German chemist Richard Abegg in 1904, to which Lewis referred to as \\"Abegg's law of valence\\" (now generally known as Abegg's rule). To Lewis it appeared that once a core of eight electrons has formed around a nucleus, the layer is filled, and a new layer is started. Lewis also noted that various ions with eight electrons also seemed to have a special stability. On these views, he proposed the rule of eight or octet rule: Ions or atoms with a filled layer of eight electrons have a special stability. Moreover, noting that a cube has eight corners Lewis envisioned an atom as having eight sides available for electrons, like the corner of a cube. Subsequently, in 1902 he devised a conception in which cubic atoms can bond on their sides to form cubic-structured molecules. In other words, electron-pair bonds are formed when two atoms share an edge, as in structure C below. This results in the sharing of two electrons. Similarly, charged ionic-bonds are formed by the transfer of an electron from one cube to another, without sharing an edge A. An intermediate state B where only one corner is shared was also postulated by Lewis. Lewis cubic-atoms bonding to form cubic-molecules Hence, double bonds are formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This results in the sharing of four electrons. In 1913, while working as the chair of the department of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, Lewis read a preliminary outline of paper by an English graduate student, Alfred Lauck Parson, who was visiting Berkeley for a year. In this paper, Parson suggested that the electron is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or \\"magneton\\" as he called it) and furthermore that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms.Parson, A.L. (1915). \\"A Magneton Theory of the Structure of the Atom\\". Smithsonian Publication 2371, Washington. This, according to Lewis, meant that bonding occurred when two electrons formed a shared edge between two complete cubes. On these views, in his famous 1916 article The Atom and the Molecule, Lewis introduced the \\"Lewis structure\\" to represent atoms and molecules, where dots represent electrons and lines represent covalent bonds. In this article, he developed the concept of the electron-pair bond, in which two atoms may share one to six electrons, thus forming the single electron bond, a single bond, a double bond, or a triple bond. Lewis-type Chemical bond In Lewis' own words: Moreover, he proposed that an atom tended to form an ion by gaining or losing the number of electrons needed to complete a cube. Thus, Lewis structures show each atom in the structure of the molecule using its chemical symbol. Lines are drawn between atoms that are bonded to one another; occasionally, pairs of dots are used instead of lines. Excess electrons that form lone pairs are represented as pair of dots, and are placed next to the atoms on which they reside: Lewis dot structures of the Nitrite-ion To summarize his views on his new bonding model, Lewis states:\\"Valence and The Structure of Atoms and Molecules\\", G. N. Lewis, American Chemical Society Monograph Series, page 79 and 81. The following year, in 1917, an unknown American undergraduate chemical engineer named Linus Pauling was learning the Dalton hook-and-eye bonding method at the Oregon Agricultural College, which was the vogue description of bonds between atoms at the time. Each atom had a certain number of hooks that allowed it to attach to other atoms, and a certain number of eyes that allowed other atoms to attach to it. A chemical bond resulted when a hook and eye connected. Pauling, however, wasn't satisfied with this archaic method and looked to the newly emerging field of quantum physics for a new method. In 1927, the physicists Fritz London and Walter Heitler applied the new quantum mechanics to the deal with the saturable, nondynamic forces of attraction and repulsion, i.e., exchange forces, of the hydrogen molecule. Their valence bond treatment of this problem, in their joint paper, was a landmark in that it brought chemistry under quantum mechanics. Their work was an influence on Pauling, who had just received his doctorate and visited Heitler and London in Z√ºrich on a Guggenheim Fellowship. Subsequently, in 1931, building on the work of Heitler and London and on theories found in Lewis' famous article, Pauling published his ground-breaking article \\"The Nature of the Chemical Bond\\" (see: manuscript) in which he used quantum mechanics to calculate properties and structures of molecules, such as angles between bonds and rotation about bonds. On these concepts, Pauling developed hybridization theory to account for bonds in molecules such as CH4, in which four sp¬≥ hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogen's 1s orbital, yielding four sigma (œÉ) bonds. The four bonds are of the same length and strength, which yields a molecular structure as shown below: A schematic presentation of hybrid orbitals overlapping hydrogens' s orbitals Owing to these exceptional theories, Pauling won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Notably he has been the only person to ever win two unshared Nobel prizes, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1963. In 1926, French physicist Jean Perrin received the Nobel Prize in physics for proving, conclusively, the existence of molecules. He did this by calculating Avogadro's number using three different methods, all involving liquid phase systems. First, he used a gamboge soap-like emulsion, second by doing experimental work on Brownian motion, and third by confirming Einstein's theory of particle rotation in the liquid phase.Perrin, Jean, B. (1926). Discontinuous Structure of Matter, Nobel Lecture, December 11. In 1937, chemist K.L. Wolf introduced the concept of supermolecules (√úbermolek√ºle) to describe hydrogen bonding in acetic acid dimers. This would eventually lead to the area of supermolecular chemistry, which is the study of non-covalent bonding. In 1951, physicist Erwin Wilhelm M√ºller invents the field ion microscope and is the first to see atoms, e.g. bonded atomic arrangements at the tip of a metal point. In 1999, researchers from the University of Vienna reported results from experiments on wave-particle duality for C60 molecules. The data published by Zeilinger et al. were consistent with de Broglie wave interference for C60 molecules. This experiment was noted for extending the applicability of wave‚Äìparticle duality by about one order of magnitude in the macroscopic direction. In 2009, researchers from IBM managed to take the first picture of a real molecule.Single molecule's stunning image. Using an atomic force microscope every single atom and bond of a pentacene molecule could be imaged.

The western terminus is at PA 23 in Caernarvon Township, across the county line from Elverson. The eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in East Whiteland Township, a short distance west of Malvern. PA 401 is called Conestoga Road its entire length and runs through rural areas with suburban development toward the eastern part of the route. PA 401 follows a former turnpike chartered in 1809 known as the Little Conestoga Turnpike. PA 401 was designated along Conestoga Road between PA 29 (Phoenixville Pike) and US 30/PA 1 in 1928. The route was extended west to PA 23 in the 1930s, at which time the entire length was paved. Route description PA 401 westbound past its eastern terminus at US 30 in East Whiteland Township PA 401 begins at an intersection with PA 23 in Caernarvon Township, Berks County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Conestoga Road. The route heads into agricultural areas as it crosses into the borough of Elverson in Chester County, where it runs between farmland to the north and rural areas of woods and homes to the south, crossing PA 82. After this junction, the road runs between housing developments to the north and rural areas to the south, crossing into West Nantmeal Township. PA 401 continues into forested areas with some farm fields as it enters East Nantmeal Township and comes to the PA 345 intersection. At this point, the route continues southeast through more woods before heading into farmland and turning south. The road crosses into forests and turns sharply to the east, entering areas of farms with a few residences. Farther east, PA 401 heads into more wooded areas of homes as it crosses into West Vincent Township and reaches the PA 100 junction. The route continues southeast past a mix of farms, woods, and housing developments, briefly crossing into Upper Uwchlan Township before heading back into West Vincent Township. The road curves south before continuing southeast into West Pikeland Township, where it crosses Pickering Creek before intersecting PA 113. Past this intersection, PA 401 passes through wooded areas of residential development, passing under the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76). A short distance later, the route comes into Charlestown Township and passes more forested areas of homes before turning east into East Whiteland Township. The route passes more housing developments and crosses Valley Creek before it widens to four lanes at the Phoenixville Pike intersection and reaches the interchange with the US 202 freeway, where it is briefly a divided highway. The route narrows back to a two-lane undivided road past this interchange and crosses the Chester Valley Trail before continuing southeast to the eastern terminus at US 30 in commercial areas. History PA 401 eastbound at the Pennsylvania Turnpike bridge A turnpike called the Little Conestoga Turnpike was chartered on March 16, 1809 to run from the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike near the Warren Tavern in Malvern northwest toward Berks County, where it intersected a junction between roads leading to Morgantown and Reading. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the current route of PA 401 was not legislated as a route. PA 401 was designated in 1928 to run along Conestoga Road between PA 29 (Phoenixville Pike) and US 30/PA 1 while the road west from PA 29 to PA 23 remained unnumbered. At this time, the entire length of Conestoga Road, including the part designated PA 401, was unpaved. During the 1930s, PA 401 was extended west along Conestoga Road from PA 29 to its current western terminus at PA 23. At this time, the entire length was paved. PA 401 has remained on the same alignment since. Major intersections PA 401 Alternate Truck PA 401 Alternate Truck at intersection with PA 100 in Eagle. Pennsylvania Route 401 Alternate Truck is a truck route around a weight- restricted bridge over a branch of the Pickering Creek in West Pikeland Township, on which trucks over 32 tons and combination loads over 40 tons are prohibited. It was signed on November 1, 2013 and is routed on Byers Road, Graphite Mine Road, PA 100, and PA 113. It has an interchange the Pennsylvania Turnpike at exit 312, running concurrent with PA 100.

He did his military service from 1942 to 1946, as a LTJG, Deck, USNR, Pacific, Chief Radio Technician, followed by Stanford University, where he gained an MS EE in 1949. He worked for IBM from 1949 to 1990, as a Staff Member, Thomas J. Watson Research Center, with the position of Senior Engineer for the last 20 years of this period. He published, sometimes with other authors, 22 technical papers, 14 patents and patent publications ‚Äî see below. Between 1949 and 1953, his activities included design and construction of the prototype of the first electronic memory for the IBM 701 computer, and managing digital electronic design for the working prototype of the highly successful AN/FSQ-7 SAGE project. The SAGE system was a nationwide network of computer centers linked to radar inputs and operated by military personnel using graphic and numeric display terminals whose operators directly controlled the air defense fighter activities in real time. This was followed by a period working for IBM Data Processing Division as Director of Standards for the company-wide transition from vacuum tube technologies to transistor circuits introduced in IBM's 1400 and 7090 computer product line. There he was responsible for planning the new circuit standards and financial controls which moved design of circuits and packaging of IBM products from each individual product group to a company-wide standards activity such that manufacture could be changed from manual assembly to fully automatic assembly and test of digital circuit assemblies. This contributed to the financial success of the IBM 1400 and 7000 series of transistorized computer products. He then spent two periods of 2 years each in the 1960s and 1980s consulting for the Institute for Defense Analyses (on loan from IBM), Recommendations were made which changed the IS support of the War Room activities in The Pentagon and studies made provided technology projections for future National Military Command System and World-Wide Military Command Systems. Edwards then became IBM Director of Interdivisional Technical Liaison, in which position he established a number of IBM internal professional groups and conferences. This was followed by 2 years as Manager, Custom & Defense Systems, IBM World Trade, where he concentrated on directing IBM's efforts relating to the NATO Air Defense information system (NADGE). During the 1960s and 1970s Edwards' emphasis was on technical planning and assisting in writing Corporate Strategies, while performing studies of image processing, gallium arsenide circuit performance, and representing IBM Research in the GUIDE Applications Development group (AS-201) (GUIDE is no longer in existence, but was a user group similar to SHARE). A major report was prepared as a result of the GUIDE studies relating to the potential for use of specification techniques in preparation of computer applications. Around 1977, he adopted the term configurable modularity, coined by Raoul de Campo of IBM Research to mean the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections, but not their internals, and developed this concept in several papers.P. Edwards, On the Architectural Requirements of an Engineered System , IBM Research Report, RC 6688 (#28797), T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 8/18/1977 He describes this as a characteristic of all systems that can be said to be \\"engineered\\", and this is one of the key concepts in the technology now referred to as Flow-Based Programming. After retirement, Edwards established, with E. C. Lamb, ELI Research and Engineering, Inc. Campbell Stubbs has a 10% interest in ELI R&E;, and a patent owned by it (see below). They have concentrated on the design and patenting of an assembly-line-based data processing architecture which has potential performance in the high Teraflop range, using off-the-shelf hardware, while being simple to program and extremely resistant to hackers and other mischief. Systems can be built which produce results which can be certified to conform to specification, as is standard practice in physical manufacturing systems.

It was one of a number of Shaker communities founded in the 19th century. It is one of the most intact and authentic surviving Shaker community sites, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993. The site is operated by a non-profit organization established in 1969 to preserve the heritage of the Canterbury Shakers. Canterbury Shaker Village is an internationally known, non-profit museum and historic site with 25 original Shaker buildings, four reconstructed Shaker buildings and of forests, fields, gardens and mill ponds under permanent conservation easement. Canterbury Shaker Village \\"is dedicated to preserving the 200-year legacy of the Canterbury Shakers and to providing a place for learning, reflection and renewal of the human spirit.\\" Visitors learn about the life, ideals, values and legacy of the Canterbury Shakers through tours, programs, exhibits, research and publications. Village staff, largely volunteer, conduct tours, and its restaurant serves traditional Shaker lunches and dinners spring, summer and fall. History  Origins and growth  The Canterbury site was one of two communities existing in what was known as the New Hampshire Bishopric, which contained Canterbury village and the Shaker Village of Enfield.Rieman, Timothy D., and Jean M. Burks. The Complete Book of Shaker Furniture. 1st ed. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc, 1993. A bishopric was composed of two or more communities in the same area or geographical location. They were designed as a way to organize communications and events amongst villages and acted as an administrative unit, which represented the governing body of the United Society of Believers.Stein, Stephen J. The Shaker Experience in America: A History of the United Society of Believers. 1st ed. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1992. In 1782 Israel Chauncey and Ebeneezer Cooley from the Mount Lebanon village of Shakers traveled to Canterbury and converted several prominent figures of the community. These figures included Benjamin and Mary Whitcher and the Wiggin and Sanborn families, who later donated land to house the Canterbury Village community of Shakers. Through a donation of land from local community members, the Canterbury Village was founded in 1792, led by Father Job Bishop. The village expanded over time, and in 1803 there were 159 members in three families. Nearly fifty years later in 1850, the site contained with a community of 300 housed in 100 buildings. Modernization Over the period in which the Canterbury Village existed as a working Shaker community, various inventions from mainstream society were adopted by its members. As Stephen Stein highlights in his definitive guide to the Shaker society, The Shaker Experience, \\"New means of transportation, sources of power, complex machinery, and communication devices transformed community life and came to symbolize the views of modern Believers.\\" In 1901 the New England Telephone Company installed telephones at the Canterbury Village site. As Stein outlined, this would have changed community life in the sense that the installation of the telephone eradicated the need for long distance travel between Shaker communities. The Canterbury Village had its own powerhouse constructed in 1910. The cost of the powerhouse was $8,000, and at first the generator powered the electric lights in sixteen community buildings. The Canterbury members were also given a television set after its invention in the 1950s by friends of the community.Starbuck, David R. Neither Plain nor Simple: New Perspective on the Canterbury Shakers. 1st ed. New Haven, CT: University Press of New England, 2004. The Shakers of Canterbury also had laborsaving inventions of their own, which contributed greatly to their economy. The Canterbury Shakers patented a washing machine, an accomplishment that was recognized by mainstream society in the form of a gold medal at the Centennial Exposition in 1876. Music was an important part of Shaker life at Canterbury. Among the many Canterbury Shaker spirituals are the hymn \\"Celestial Praises\\" from 1841, and the song \\"We Will All Go Home with You\\" from 1862. Between 1842 and 1908 there were eleven different Shaker hymnals published by the Shakers at Canterbury.Hall, Roger L. A Guide to Shaker Music - With Music Supplement. Stoughton, MA: 6th ed. PineTree Press, 2006.  Decline  In 1905, there were 100 members, and by 1916, the Shakers in Canterbury had dwindled to just 49, 47 women and two men. In addition, there were 12 females under the age of 21 as well as one non-Shaker who had been living in the village for seven years. The last male member of the Canterbury Village, Brother Irving Greenwood, died in 1939. In 1947, when LIFE reporter Nina Leen visited the village, there were 16 sisters remaining, ranging in age from 43 to 80. In 1957, after \\"months of prayer\\", Eldresses Gertrude, Emma, and Ida, the leaders of the United Society of Believers and who were based out of Canterbury, voted to close the Shaker Covenant, the document which all new members need to sign to become members of the Shakers. In 1988, speaking about the three men and women in their 20s and 30s who had joined the Shakers and were living in the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, Eldress Bertha Lindsay stated, \\"To become a Shaker you have to sign a legal document taking the necessary vows and that document, the official covenant, is locked up in our safe. Membership is closed forever.\\" By as early as 1980, Canterbury Shaker Village had opened to visitors as a historic site, with tours, greetings by some of the few remaining Shakers, and a gift shop, called \\"Simple Gifts\\". In 1992, it received 60,000 visitors from all 50 US states and 45 countries. In 1988, Eldress Gertrude Soule died, leaving only two Shakers left at Canterbury Village, Eldress Bertha Lindsay and Sister Ethel Hudson, aged 93 and 96, respectively. Bertha Lindsay, the last Shaker eldress, died on 3 October 1990, leaving only one Shaker at Canterbury, Sister Ethel Hudson. By September 1992, she had died at the age of 96.  Governance  The Shakers were organized in a hierarchical system of four levels. The first level to which every member of the community was involved was the family. Above the family were members known as elders and eldresses, deacons and deaconesses.

Many French organ builders adopted his English bellows design. Slonimsky, Nicolas Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, 7th ed. 1984. Schirmer Books, New York, N.Y. . Early life and career Organ of Ch√¢lons Cathedral, delivered in 1849 and housed in a case designed by Jean-Jacques Arveuf-Fransquin Abbey was born at Whilton, a Northamptonshire village, on 22 December 1785. In his youth, he was an apprentice for James and David Davis, and later for Hugh Russel after 1818, both reputable organ builders in their day. In 1826 Abbey went to Paris, on the invitation of S√©bastien √ârard, the celebrated harp and pianoforte maker, to work upon an organ which √ârard had designed, and which he sent to the Exhibition of the Productions of National Industry in 1827, and also to build an organ for the Convent of the Legion of Honour, at St. Denis. He also built an organ from √ârard's design for the chapel of the Tuileries, which, however, had only a short existence, being destroyed in the Revolution of 1830. Having established himself as an organ- builder in Paris, Abbey became extensively employed in the construction, renovation, and enlargement of organs in France and elsewhere. Amongst others he built choir organs for accompanying voices for the cathedrals of Rheims, Nantes, Versailles, and √âvreux, and for the churches of St. Eustache, Saint- Nicholas-des-Champs, St. Elizabeth, St. Medard, St. Etienne du Mont, and St. Thomas Aquinas, in Paris; and large organs for the cathedrals of La Rochelle, Rennes, Viviers, Tulle, Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne, Bayeux, and Amiens, and for churches, convents, and chapels at Saint-Denis, Orl√©ans, Caen, Ch√¢lons, Picpus, and Versailles. He repaired and enlarged organs in the cathedrals of Mende, Moulins, Rheims, √âvreux, and Nevers, and in the churches of Saint- √âtienne-du-Mont, Saint-Philippe du Roule, the Assumption, and St. Louis d'Antin in Paris. He also built many organs for Chile and South America. In 1831 Abbey was employed, at the instance of Meyerbeer (who had introduced the instrument into the score of his opera Robert le Diable, then about to be produced), to build an organ for the Grand Opera at Paris, which instrument continued to be used there until it was destroyed, with the theatre, by fire in 1873. Abbey was the first who introduced into French organs the English mechanism and the bellows invented by Cummins. His example was speedily followed by the French builders, and from that period may be dated the improvements in organ-building which raised the French builders to eminence. Death He died at Versailles on 19 February 1859. He left two sons, E. and J. Abbey, to carry on the business of organ-builders in Versailles.Fuller Maitland, J. A (editor). Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians; Vol. 1. New York: Macmillan Company (1911), p. 2. His son John Albert Abbey and his grandson John Mary Abbey were also organ builders.

It is housed at the University of Maryland, College Park in Hornbake Library. NPBA serves as a living reminder of the cultural and intellectual continuity of the effort to make television something more than commercial networks can provide. Its mission is to work with the primary national entities of American noncommercial broadcasting to identify records and programs of historical value and to serve as a repository for those materials. Its collection is open to the public. NPBA was initiated by educator and former PBS board member Donald R McNeil (1923‚Äì1996). Citing the language of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 that the primary entities of public broadcasting will \\"establish and maintain a library and archives of non-commercial educational television and radio programs and related materials,\\" McNeil convinced the chief officers of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and the Association of America's Public Television Stations to launch a cooperative effort to gather in one place the historical record of American public broadcasting. The University of Maryland Libraries agreed to serve as the academic host for the effort and the Archives was officially inaugurated June 1, 1990. NPBA maintains the archival record of key public broadcasting agencies such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), National Public Radio (NPR), Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), Children's Television Workshop (CTW) as well as important program materials from stations WAMU 88.5 FM, WETA and Maryland Public Television. The NPBA includes the NPR News Programming Collection.Press release NPBA also maintains the personal papers of over 120 individuals who were associated with public radio or television during the course of their careers. NPBA continues to grow and develop with the regular transfer of participants' records to its storage areas. The Archives also seeks new collections from other organizations and individuals associated with public broadcasting. To enhance its holdings the Archives welcomes additional correspondence, memoranda, reports, meeting minutes and daily logs or journals; photographs, films, audio/videotapes, kinescopes, graphic materials, scrapbooks, journals and magazines.

His attacking excursions down the right wing sometimes caused concern to his team's supporters but probably more to his opponents. After service in the Royal Navy during the war he became a milkman and played in local league football, signing professional for Stockport County at the relatively late age of 22. When the Stockport manager Andy Beattie moved to Huddersfield Town in the 1952 close season, Staniforth followed. Huddersfield had just been relegated. Staniforth, together with all the remainder of the defence, played in every game in the following season in which Huddersfield finished in second place and so were promoted back to the First Division. In their first season back, Huddersfield maintained their momentum and were challenging for the championship. This led to Staniforth playing three times for England 'B' and then gaining eight England caps, all in 1954, including three in the final stages of the World Cup. He was also in the England side which notoriously lost 7‚Äì1 to Hungary although this did not lead to his losing his place. In 1955 Huddersfield were becoming concerned about the ageing profile of their team and Staniforth was dropped after being given the run-around by Bobby Mitchell in a quarter-final of the F.A. Cup. In July 1955 he moved to Sheffield Wednesday, along with Roy Shiner, in an exchange deal which brought Tony Conwell and Jackie Marriott to Huddersfield (they were respectively eight and four years younger). At the age of 31, however, Staniforth's career was far from over. It must have seemed like d√©j√† vu. Like his arrival at Huddersfield, Wednesday had just been relegated from the First Division and were promoted in his first season. Also he teamed up again with former Huddersfield defender Don McEvoy. He went on to make 102 appearances for Wednesday over four seasons, during which they were promoted twice and relegated once. In October 1959 he moved to Barrow as player- manager, later to be joined by McEvoy as a player. He retired from playing after 38 games and resigned as manager in 1964. Later he had two spells on the coaching staff at Hillsborough. He died in Barrow on 5 October 1988, aged 64.

Early life James Kenneth Stephen was the second son of Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, barrister-at-law, and his wife Mary Richenda Cunningham. Known as 'Jem' among his family and close friends, he was first cousin to Virginia Woolf (n√©e Stephen), and shared with his cousin symptoms of bipolar disorder that would afflict him increasingly in later life. As a youth attending Eton College as a King's Scholar, Stephen's prodigious size and physical strength helped him prove himself an outstanding player of the Eton Wall Game, representing the Collegers (King's Scholars) on St. Andrew's Day from 1874 to 1877 and leading the team to victory as Keeper of the College Wall in his final two years. He has been commemorated in a toast raised by College Wall on the eve of St Andrew's Day every year for over a century: \\"In Piam Memoriam J.K.S.\\" Stephen developed a reputation as an intellectual, and it was said that he spoke in a pedantic, but highly articulate and entertaining manner. At King's College, Cambridge, again as a King's Scholar, he continued a flourishing academic career: he was a member of the Apostles intellectual society, and President of the Cambridge Union Society in the Michaelmas term of 1880, and was made a Fellow of King's College in 1885. Relationship with Prince Albert Victor In 1883, Stephen was chosen as the tutor and companion of Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale (nicknamed Eddy), the son of the Prince of Wales,McDonald, Deborah (2007). The Prince, His Tutor and the Ripper. McFarland. and was expected to help raise the prince's poor academic standing before he attended Trinity College, Cambridge.Aronson, pp. 64‚Äì67; Cook, pp. 101‚Äì104. Stephen was initially optimistic about tutoring the prince, but by the time the party were to move to Cambridge he had concluded, \\"I do not think he can possibly derive much benefit from attending lectures at Cambridge ... He hardly knows the meaning of the words to read\\".Cook p. 103, quoting from correspondence in the Royal archives Z 474/63. Some biographers have suggested Stephen was emotionally attached to Albert Victor, but whether or not his feelings were overtly homosexual is open to question.Aronson, Theo (1994). Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld, pp. 66‚Äì67. London: John Murray. In 1972, writer Michael Harrison claimed that a sexual relationship began between tutor and pupil, ending when Prince Eddy was gazetted to the 10th Hussars on 17 June 1885, and resulted in a scandal of which, apparently, little evidence remains.Harrison, Michael (1972). Clarence: The life of H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864‚Äì1892). London and New York: W. H. Allen. Rumbelow, Donald (2004). The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated Penguin Books. . Accident Stephen suffered a serious head injury in an accident in the winter of 1886 or 1887, which may have exacerbated the bipolar disorder from which he suffered, a condition also found in his cousin, Virginia Woolf.McDonald, The Prince, His Tutor and the Ripper Separate descriptions of the accident exist. Virginia Woolf's biographer, Quentin Bell, says that the family tradition was that Stephen was struck in the head by some object from a moving train. Others claim that Stephen was injured when a horse he was riding shied and backed him into the moving vane of a windmill.Harrison, Michael (1972). Clarence: The life of H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864‚Äì1892). London and New York: W. H. Allen. While Stephen originally appeared to have made a complete recovery, it was later discovered that his brain had been permanently damaged and his behaviour became increasingly erratic. Bell relates incidents of Stephen plunging the blade from a sword stick into bread; becoming deluded that he was a painter of great genius; rushing about dangerously in a hansom cab; and \\"'on another occasion he appeared at breakfast and announced, as though it were an amusing incident, that the doctors had told him that he would either die or go completely mad.'\\"Rumbelow, Donald (2004). The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated, pp. 99. Penguin Books. . Stephen became a patient of physician Sir William Gull, but his rapid mental and physical decline saw him drift from one project to the next with little focus or interest ‚Äì outside of completing two volumes of poetry ‚Äì before he was finally committed to a mental asylum. Poetry In 1891, Stephen became a published poet under the initials J.K.S. with the collections Lapsus Calami and Quo Musa Tendis both released that year. Rudyard Kipling called him \\"that genius\\" and told how he \\"dealt with Haggard and me in some stanzas which I would have given much to have written myself\\".Kipling, R. Something of Myself, For My Friends Known and Unknown. 1937. Those stanzas, in which Stephen deplores the state of contemporary writing,Ellis P.B. H. Rider Haggard: a voice from the infinite. Routledge, 1978 appear in his poem 'To R. K.': > Will there never come a season Which shall rid us from the curse Of a prose > which knows no reason And an unmelodious verse: When the world shall cease > to wonder At the genius of an Ass, And a boy's eccentric blunder Shall not > bring success to pass: When mankind shall be delivered From the clash of > magazines, And the inkstand shall be shivered Into countless smithereens: > When there stands a muzzled stripling, Mute, beside a muzzled bore: When the > Rudyards cease from Kipling And the Haggards Ride no more. \\"The Last Ride Together (From Her Point of View)\\" parodies Robert Browning's \\"Last Ride Together\\"; Lord Byron is parodied in \\"A Grievance\\"; and William Wordsworth in \\"A Sonnet\\": > Two voices are there: one is of the deep; It learns the storm-cloud's > thunderous melody, Now roars, now murmurs with the changing sea, Now bird- > like pipes, now closes soft in sleep: And one is of an old half-witted sheep > Which bleats articulate monotony, And indicates that two and one are three, > That grass is green, lakes damp, and mountains steep: And, Wordsworth, both > are thine. Stephen also took a satirical and occasionally nostalgic approach to his academic life and colleagues. Stephen wrote a satirical pastiche of Thomas Gray's \\"Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College\\" pillorying Eton for being Tory. Stephen was at Cambridge at the same time as the distinguished antiquarian and writer of ghost-stories, M. R. James, and mentions him at the end of a curious Latin celebration of then-current worthies of 'Coll. Regale' (King's College): > Vivat J.K. Stephanus, Humilis poeta! Vivat Monty Jamesius, Vivant A, B, C, > D, E Et totus Alphabeta! Stephen's poem The Old School List from Quo Musa Tendis is included in the front pages of H. E. C. Stapleton's Eton School Lists 1853-1892, and the author refers to him in the preface as 'an Etonian of great promise, who died only too early for his numerous friends'. During his time at Eton, Stephen was a friend of Harry Goodhart (1858‚Äì1895), who became an England international footballer and later a Professor at the University of Edinburgh. Goodhart is referred to as \\"one of them's wed\\" in the last verse of The Old School List: > There were two good fellows I used to know. \\\\--How distant it all appears! > We played together in football weather, And messed together for years: Now > one of them's wed, and the other's dead So long that he's hardly missed Save > by us, who messed with him years ago: But we're all in the old School List. A poem which gave him a reputation as a misogynist is \\"Men and Women,\\" where he describes two people, a man and a woman, whom he does not know but to whom he takes a violent dislike. The first part, subtitled \\"In the Backs\\" (The Backs is a riverside area of Cambridge), concludes > ...I do not want to see that girl again: I did not like her: and I should > not mind If she were done away with, killed, or ploughed. She did not seem > to serve a useful end: And certainly she was not beautiful. Death In 1891, Stephen was committed to St Andrew's Hospital, a mental asylum in Northampton.University of Toronto - Representative Poetry Online In January 1892 the former royal tutor heard that his erstwhile pupil, the 28-year-old Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence, a man destined to be king one day, had died of pneumonia at Sandringham, after contracting influenza. On hearing the news, Stephen refused to eat, and he died twenty days later, aged 32. The cause of death, according to the death certificate, was mania.McDonald, The Prince, His Tutor and the Ripper Legacy Stephen's outstanding record in the Eton Wall Game has become part of school legend: unverified accounts suggest that in his final year, he held up the whole of the opposing team single handed for five minutes until the rest of College Wall made it to the furrow. Ever after, the King's Scholars of Eton College have honoured his memory with a toast at the Christmas Sock Supper and other festive occasions - in piam memoriam J.K.S. - \\"to the pious memory of James Kenneth Stephen\\". Stephen was recalled in less pious memory in a play by former Eton housemaster and Old Etonian, Angus Graham-Campbell: entitled Sympathy for the Devil, it premiered at the Eton Drama Festival in 1993 and was based on the notion that Stephen could have been one of the Jack the Ripper suspects. Renewed interest in the 1888 Whitechapel murders had exploded in 1970 when British physician Thomas E. A. Stowell, allegedly working from the papers of Sir William Gull, made the veiled suggestion that Stephen's former pupil Prince Albert Victor, named only as \\"S\\", was the culprit.Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970). \\"Jack the Ripper ‚Äì A Solution?\\". The Criminologist vol.5, pp. 40‚Äì51. In 1972, writer Michael Harrison, working from this sensational theory, had come to the conclusion that \\"S\\" was not the prince, but actually Stephen who was committing the murders \\"out of a twisted desire for revenge\\" because of the dissolution of an alleged homosexual relationship between the two. Harrison contends that the breakup of the relationship with Eddy, combined with his mental decline, provoked Stephen to act out his own poem \\"Air: Kaphoozelum\\" in which the protagonist kills ten harlots.Harrison, Michael (1972). Clarence: The life of H.R.H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864‚Äì1892). London and New York: W. H. Allen. Forensic psychiatrist David Abrahamsen identified Stephen as matching his psychological profile of Jack The Ripper, claiming that Prince Eddy was an accomplice in his crimes and that the two enjoyed a mutually dependent relationship, with Stephen as the dominant partner.Abrahamsen, David. Murder and Madness, The Secret Life of Jack the Ripper. This and similar theories have been dismissed on a number of counts, with some citing that Stephen would have been unable to commit any murders in London and return to Cambridge in time for lectures the following morning.McDonald, The Prince, His Tutor and the Ripper Harrison had also connected Stephen's handwriting with the Ripper letters \\"From Hell\\" and \\"Dear Boss\\", and that the internal style of some of Stephen's poems matches some of the anonymous Ripper letters. This connection was rebutted by Thomas J. Mann in an article in the Journal of the World Association of Document Examiners (June 1975) in which Mann determines that only the Lusk letter is likely to be genuine and that the connection between Stephen's handwriting and that letter was minimal: \\"The overwhelming evidence is that the two do not match; and if the author of the Lusk letter was indeed Jack the Ripper, then J.K. Stephen was not that man.\\"Rumbelow, Donald (2004). The Complete Jack the Ripper: Fully Revised and Updated, pp. 204. Penguin Books. . Despite this, Stephen, Eddy and their mutual doctor Sir William Gull have been inextricably linked in the public imagination to these unsolved crimes.

He controlled the National City Bank of New York (later to become Citibank), the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western railroad, and the Moses Taylor & Co. import business, and he held numerous other investments in railroads and industry. Early life Taylor was born on January 11, 1806 to Jacob B. Taylor and Martha (n√©e Brant) Taylor. His father was a close associate of John Jacob Astor and acted as his agent by purchasing New York real estate while concealing Astor's interest. Astor's relationship with the Taylor family provided Moses with an early advantage. Career At age 15, Moses Taylor began working at J. D. Brown shippers. He soon moved to a clerk's position in the firm of Gardiner Greene Howland and Samuel Howland's firm G. G. & S. Howland Company of New York, a shipping and import firm that traded with South America. By 1832, at age 26, Moses had sufficient wealth to marry, leave the Howland company, and start his own business as a sugar broker. As a sugar broker, Moses dealt with slave-owning Cuban sugar growers, found buyers for their product, exchanged currency, and advised and assisted them with their investments. He nurtured relationships with those slave-owners, who relied on him for loans and investments to support their plantations. Taylor never visited Cuba, but his friendship with Henry Augustus Coit, a prominent trader who was fluent in Spanish, enabled him to trade with the Cuban growers. Taylor soon discovered that loans and investments provided returns that were as good as, or better than, those from the sugar business, although the sugar trade remained a core source of income. By the 1840s his income was largely from interest and investments. By 1847, Moses Taylor was listed as one of New York City's 25 millionaires. Banking and investments Thomas Nast cartoon of the \\"White-washing Committee\\" (L‚ÄìR: Astor, Taylor, Marshall O. Roberts) When the Panic of 1837 allowed Astor to take over what was then City Bank of New York (today known as Citibank), he named Moses Taylor as director. Moses himself had doubled his fortune during the panic, and brought his growing financial connections to the bank. He acquired equity in the bank and in 1855 became its president, operating it largely in support of his and his associates' businesses and investments. In the 1850s Moses invested in iron and coal, and began purchasing interest in the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western railroad. When the Panic of 1857 brought the railroad to the brink of bankruptcy, Moses obtained control by purchasing its outstanding shares for $5 a share. Within seven years the shares became worth $240, and the D. L. & W was one of the premier railroads of the country. By 1865 Moses held 20,000 shares worth almost $50 million. Moses held an interest in the New York, Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company that Cyrus West Field had founded in 1854. Although its attempts to lay a cable across the Atlantic were initially unsuccessful, it eventually succeeded and in 1866 became the first transatlantic telegraph company. Taylor also had controlling interest in the largest two of the seven gas companies in Manhattan that were merged (after his death) to form the Consolidated Gas Company in 1884, eventually becoming Consolidated Edison. Taylor's Manhattan Gas Company and New York Gas Light Company were 45% of the merged Consolidated Gas, and his descendants remained some the largest individual shareholders of Consolidated Edison. Tammany Hall After the Civil War, during which he assisted the Union with financing the war debt, he continued to invest in iron, railroads, and real estate. His real estate holdings in New York brought him into close association with Boss Tweed of New York's Tammany Hall. Moses sat in 1871 on a committee made up of New York's most influential and successful businessmen and signed his name to a report that commended Tweed's controller for his honesty and integrity. This report was considered a notorious whitewash. Personal life Taylor was married to Catharine Anne Wilson (1810‚Äì1892). Together, they were the parents of: * Albertina Shelton Taylor (1833‚Äì1900), who married Percy Rivington Pyne (1820‚Äì1895) in 1855. Pyne, an assistant to Moses, became president of City Bank upon Moses' death. * Mary Taylor (1837‚Äì1907), who married George Lewis (1833‚Äì1888) * George Campbell Taylor (1837‚Äì1907) * Katherine Wilson Taylor (1839‚Äì1925), who married Robert Winthrop * Henry Augustus Coit Taylor (1841‚Äì1921), who married Charlotte Talbot Fearing (1845‚Äì1899) in 1868. After her death, he married Josephine Whitney Johnson (1849‚Äì1927) in 1903. Taylor left an estate worth $50 million upon his death in 1921, just a few months before the death of his nephew Moses Taylor Pyne. Moses died in 1882 and although he owned a vault at the New York City Marble Cemetery that already contained members of his family, he was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York City.Obituary: Moses left his fortune to his wife and children. Many of the Taylor family descendants were prominent in New York and Newport society and several prominent families owe a substantial portion of their fortunes to the Taylor inheritances.  Descendants  Through his daughter Albertina, the Pynes family became a dynasty of bankers that survives to this day. Percy's son Moses Taylor Pyne was a benefactor of Princeton University who supported its development from a college into a university and left an estate worth $100 million at his death in 1921. Through his daughter Katherine, he was a grandfather of Hamilton Fish Kean (1862‚Äì1941), ancestor of the political Kean family which includes the former governor of New Jersey Thomas Kean. Legacy Not noted for philanthropy during his life, at its end in 1882 Moses Taylor donated $250,000 to build a hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania to benefit his iron and coal workers, and workers of the D. L. & W railroad. The Moses Taylor hospital continues in operation today.

It is approximately one mile SE of Blythe Bridge and has a population of approximately 300. From the 2011 census the population of this hamlet has been included with Draycott-in-the- Moors. The \\"Izaak Walton\\" public house and restaurant is named after the seventeenth-century fisherman whose book The Compleat Angler is still in publication today. Walton was born in Stafford, and legend has it that he fished in the River Blithe, which is near the pub. During the English Civil War Staffordshire saw a great deal of conflict. The local manor house Paynsley Hall was first held for Charles I, then garrisoned by Parliamentarian forces before being destroyed. The site of the hall is protected as a scheduled ancient monument. Although little masonry remains, it is significant as an example of a moated site. Although it is still a rural area, the hamlet is the home of the Blythe Colour Works, which was established to produce under-glaze colours for the pottery industry. Cresswell is also the home of Blythe Cricket Club. Cresswell formerly had a railway station on the Crewe to Derby Line, but, although trains still pass through the hamlet, there are now no stations between Blythe Bridge and Uttoxeter. In the twentieth century there was also a short line from Cresswell to Cheadle (Cheadle Branch Line). Places of worship Cresswell has an old Roman Catholic community. After the Reformation part of the population worshipped not in the local parish church at Draycott in the Moors, but in a private chapel at Paynsley Hall, whose owners, the Draycot family, remained faithful to the old religion. Anthony Babington (famous for the Babington Plot) married into the Draycot family. In 1791 Roman Catholicism was legalised in England and St. Mary's Catholic Church was constructed to serve the local Roman Catholics. The church is now served by the clergy of St. Augustine's, Meir, Stoke-on-Trent.

A significant event of the Peninsular War, France's Grande Arm√©e lay siege to the town of Girona for seven months, from 6 May to 12 December 1809. Girona was strategically important because it controlled the main road between France and Spain. General Mariano Alvarez de Castro Some 32,000 French and Westphalian troops besieged the town. General Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr was in command of the French during much of the siege. Marshal Pierre Augereau took command after 12 October. The Girona defense was under General Mariano Alvarez de Castro, with about 9,000 regular troops and militiamen. Girona held out until disease and famine compelled it to capitulate. Though badly outnumbered, the Spanish defenders forced a lengthy siege, and a large French army was pinned down for an entire campaigning season. The battle became legendary over the course of Spain's War of Independence, and Alvarez became a national hero. Background In 1808 Joseph Bonaparte acceded to the throne of Spain, effectively making Spain a client state to Napoleonic France. Spain's resistance to France precipitated the Peninsular War 1808-1814. In 1809 General Alvarez, commander of Montju√Øc Castle in Barcelona, was ordered by his superiors to surrender the castle to the French, although he had been preparing to resist. Alvarez left Barcelona and joined the Spanish rebels against French rule. The Spanish Government in Cadiz named him commander of the Army of Catalonia and Governor of Girona. The city of Girona was on the main road between France and Spain, hence it was strategically important. The French had twice besieged the town the year before, first in the Battle of Girona 20-21 June, and then in the three-week Second Siege of Girona from 24 July to 16 August, both times having to retreat.Summary of the French War Pedres de Girona (in Catalan) Taking command of the city on 1 February 1809, Alvarez immediately started preparing its defense, requesting provisions for 7,000 men. The city of Girona at that time had a population of between 13,000 and 14,000, and it was defended by a garrison of about 5,700.The Edinburgh Annual Register for 1809, p. 769. At Google Books. Retrieved 3 August 2013. The defenders of Girona included Irish mercenaries belonging to the Ultonia Regiment. The women of the town organized into a Company of Santa Barbara to care for the sick and wounded, transport ammunition, and other tasks. On 1 April, Alvarez proclaimed his famous edict, to the effect that if the city were attacked, he would immediately execute anybody that mentioned surrender or capitulation. On 3 May, arms were distributed to 1717 volunteers. Grahit y Papell, Emilio (1896) Historia de los sitios de Gerona en 1808 y 1809. Ministerio de Educaci√≥n, Cultura y Deporte. Retrieved 3 August 2013. The fortifications of Girona were antiquated, since nothing had been done to modernize the them since the War of the Spanish Succession a hundred years earlier. The medieval walls were thin, so they often could not support artillery. The area of the Mercadal, to the west of the River Onyar, was particularly weakly fortified. The French did not attack there, however, fearing the dangers of artillery fire from the heights of Girona and the difficulty of street fighting after their recent experience in the second siege of Zaragoza earlier in the year. The wall fortifications were augmented by surrounding bastions such as La Merced and Santa Maria by the Onyar to the south and north of Girona, respectively, and the several forts and redoubts (Capuchins, Chapter, Calvary, etc.) along the crest of the mountain behind Girona. Although Montju√Øc Castle, just to the north of Girona, was well-supplied with cannon, there were less than 300 men who were experienced with artillery. Nevertheless, Alvarez made the most of the defenses. Siege Map of the Third Siege of Gerona in 1809 indicating city defenses and French deployments around the city. The direction of north is to the right. At the beginning of May 1809, General Saint-Cyr began setting up artillery batteries and fortifications, mounting 40 gun batteries. The French forces consisted of over 17,000 men led by general Honor√© Charles Reille, soon superseded by general Jean-Antoine Verdier, engaged in the siege, and an additional 15,000 men in a covering army led by Saint-Cyr, used to protect and reinforce the siege. On 12 June, Alvarez rejected the terms of a truce offered, and Saint-Cyr ordered bombardment to commence after midnight 13‚Äì14 June. Over the next seven months some 20,000 bombs and grenades and 80,000 cannonballs were fired into the city and the adjacent Montju√Øc Castle. After three weeks of heavy bombardment, on 7 July the French attempted to take the castle by frontal assault. Verdier employed 2500 men in the attempt, and although the cannons of the fort had been silenced, he still lost over a thousand men to unrelenting musket fire. The French were forced to retreat. They resumed bombardment of the fort, reducing three sides of the castle to ruins. With little water left and the French siege works arriving at the castle moat, on 11 August the remaining defenders of the castle took what supplies they could, evacuated to Girona, and blew up the castle. There was little left of the castle when the French took possession. Alvarez then barricaded and entrenched the city, and the siege continued for another four months. Attempts to relieve the city by General Joaqu√≠n Blake were weak and only minimally successful. Reinforcements of only 3,600 troops were able to enter Girona during the siege. The Great Day of Girona by Ram√≥n Mart√≠ Alsina (1864). The painting depicts the defeat of the French, seen retreating down the hill to the right, at the end of the battle on 19 September 1809. The French strategy had been to take Montju√Øc, after which Girona was expected to surrender, but in September another entreaty from the French for the Spanish to surrender was rejected. The French began their first direct assault on the city on 19 September. The incessant bombardment, now also from nearby Montju√Øc, had breached several holes in the city's northern defensive walls. After bloody hand-to-hand combat and repeated assaults were repulsed, the French finally abandoned the attempt and retreated. The French lost 624 soldiers in the attack, while the Spanish lost 251. The event demoralized the French and rallied the Spanish. Towards the end of September, General Saint- Cyr left his command, angered by the fact he was to be replaced as the head of the French and Allied force. He left the troops without an overall commander for several days, in clear disobedience of orders received in June. He was replaced by Marshal Augereau, who assumed command of the siege on 12 October. After the bloody engagements of August and September, the French adopted a more patient strategy, attempting to force surrender by starvation and disease. In December Alvarez, seriously ill and delirious, handed over command to Brigadier Juan Bolivar. The French had taken several important fortifications of the city, and the Spanish were in retreat within the city itself. Two days later, on 12 December, the town finally capitulated. On the Spanish side, it is estimated that some 10,000 soldiers and civilians died during the siege, mostly from disease or famine. Only about 8000 of the original 14,000 inhabitants of the city survived, while about 3000 emaciated soldiers remained to surrender. French losses were approximately 14,000, over half of those to disease. Aftermath After the extensive bombardment by artillery and 7 months of siege, the town of Girona was virtually uninhabitable. There was little of value left in the city for the French. As described by Charles Oman in his A History of the Peninsular War (1908), Girona In spite of Alvarez's poor health, the French imprisoned him and the other officers from Girona at Perpignan, France on 23 December. After a month, he was taken to stand trial for treason at the castle of San Fernando in Figueres. On 21 January 1810, the day after his arrival at the castle, Alvarez was found dead in his cell. Owing to the long delays and heavy losses suffered by the French, the town's resistance served Spanish purposes, however. The siege had pinned down the French army for an entire campaigning season. The battle became legendary over the course of Spain's War of Independence, rallying national resistance, and Alvarez became a national hero. The success of the Spanish in repelling the 19 September attack was commemorated in 1864 by a painting by Ram√≥n Mart√≠ Alsina entitled \\"The Great Day of Girona\\". Roughly 5m by 11m in size, this large painting is the property of the Catalan National Art Museum. On 14 September 2010 it was put on permanent display in an auditorium of the government of Catalonia in Girona.Google Art ofereix en detall m√©s de 30.000 obres, entre les quals ¬¥El gran dia de Girona' (in Catalan) Independence Square In Girona today, the Pla√ßa de la Independ√®ncia, is a town square that honors the defenders of Girona during this war.

It was part of an era of momentous change in the Soviet Union. Production and crew The show involved a large production team and logistics provided by Eurotruk. Generators powered the entire event as it was broadcast as a pay-per-view event by MTV. Catering came from the UK. There were direct-dial telephone lines from the production office, and satellite uplink from Bear Lake back to the USA. The show production radios were the latest from the US and some were encrypted. There was 6 Megawatts of power available from the generators. Management The concert was put together by the Make a Difference Foundation, its founder, rock producer and manager Doc McGhee, Stas Namin and other major players in the Soviet Union and the United States. It is often stated that McGhee agreed to bring his artists to Moscow after becoming involved in a drug scandal himself and wishing to avoid a jail sentence, but he explicitly denied that in 2011. \\"We always wanted to go over to Moscow and do the first rock show in the Soviet Union. I wanted to do their Woodstock.\\" Since it had also been part of that plan that the proceeds would go to Make a Difference and doctors would be brought to the USSR to teach methods of treating addiction (Soviet doctors at the time primarily used electroshock therapy for that purpose), he did not expect the sentencing judge would have denied him the opportunity. M√∂tley Cr√ºe have been on record stating they were upset with McGhee at this point in time. They felt McGhee was favoring Bon Jovi, whom he also managed, and whom Cr√ºe disdained. When Bon Jovi closed the show, they used pyrotechnics, which M√∂tley Cr√ºe had been told they could not do (McGhee claims it was a malfunction on one side of the stadium that he did not hear because he was backstage). Sebastian Bach of Skid Row, whom McGhee also managed, says Tommy Lee went over to him and said \\"Your manager's a fucking asshole\\" and chugged most of a bottle of vodka Bach had been drinking (up to this point, Lee has said, it was the first time the band had done a show sober). Then he ran up to McGhee, punched him in the face and told him he could go manage The Chipmunks because he was no longer M√∂tley Cr√ºe's manager. Bon Jovi fired him as well shortly afterwards. Lee and his bandmates were still so angry they refused to fly home on the same plane as McGhee. Venue The event was held over two days in Moscow's largest stadium, Central Lenin Stadium (now called Luzhniki Stadium), which has a seating capacity of about 100,000. However, as the concert used a proscenium stage rather than an arena stage, a thousands of seats behind the stage were not occupied. The event was the first rock concert to be held at the stadium, which had previously been used primarily for sporting events.

Each band recorded a song originally by some famous rock artist who had suffered a drug- or alcohol- related death. These included songs from The Who, the Sex Pistols, Jimi Hendrix, Tommy Bolin, Thin Lizzy, and Janis Joplin, along with a collaboration for Led Zeppelin's \\"Moby Dick\\" (for John Bonham), and a live collaboration where the bands perform a medley of Elvis Presley and Led Zeppelin songs. Problems Noted in books such as Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal, the concert also showcased the ego clashes which eventually helped lead to the collapse of glam metal shortly thereafter. Many of the bands argued over who went on before whom, and many were envious of Bon Jovi, who not only headlined the event and was far more considered to be pop music among the hard rock and heavy metal community, but also had a much more theatrical stage spectacle and longer set times; each band was supposed to do a stripped-down show with just music and no spectacular theatrics. Jon Bon Jovi supposedly offered his headlining spot to Ozzy Osbourne after Ozzy threatened to not go through with his set (a move many felt was calculated to further JBJ's 'boy next door' persona). Ozzy's set was initially scheduled before M√∂tley Cr√ºe's set. Apparently, Ozzy felt his band was bigger and he should go on after M√∂tley Cr√ºe. To solve the problem, M√∂tley Cr√ºe went on before Ozzy but the tape was edited so it appeared Ozzy went on before M√∂tley Cr√ºe to the viewers back in the U.S. Those involved in the show's production felt this was an egotistical bush move on Ozzy's behalf since this was supposed to be for charity, and left many in the rock 'n roll community confused since Ozzy and M√∂tley Cr√ºe toured together for Ozzy's Bark at the Moon and M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Shout at the Devil albums, respectively, and became fast friends during the tour. The members of M√∂tley Cr√ºe were so incensed about preferences shown to Bon Jovi that Tommy Lee punched manager Doc McGhee (who was also the manager for Bon Jovi) backstage at the venue (McGhee was fired shortly thereafter), opting to fly back to the US on their own. The concert was also often chided by the bands themselves as being hypocritical, as many of the musicians were drinking or using drugs at the time despite the ties with the Make a Difference Foundation. The event became known for inspiring the song \\"Wind of Change\\" by the Scorpions, a ballad which became a soundtrack to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the end of Soviet Union.

Lando's passion for life was revived, but it didn't last long. Without apparent reason, Lando left Kalin, who became very angry and heart-broken. As time passed, Lando, still in distress, found that Kalin had become a supermodel, and saw her presence everywhere. Lando yearned to see Kalin again and explain why he had left her. He finally got the opportunity and met Kalin, but this encounter again ended tragically as Kalin ran into an accident and turned blind. Later on, Kalin obtained a cornea donor that enabled her to see again, but she could not seem to find Lando, whom she was actually very much in love with.

(2013). Foundations of child and youth care. Dubuque: Kendall Hunt. Child and Youth Care is primarily a way of working with others and practitioners can be found in a variety of roles including direct care, private practice, educator, trainer, writer, supervisor, manager, researcher, and more. They are sometimes known as Child and Youth Workers, Child and Youth Counselors, Youth Workers, or Child and Youth Care Workers. There are strong connections around the world between Child and Youth Care and Social Pedagogy.  Global network  The International Child and Youth Care Network promotes reading, discussion, and networking among Child and Youth Care Practitioners through a monthly journal, 4000 member discussion group, and an archive of writing by and for Child and Youth Care Workers. The Child and Youth Care Association of Newfoundland Labrador hosted the first Child and Youth Care World Conference in June 2013 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The second Child and Youth Care World Conference was held in August 2016 in Vienna, Austria. The third Child and Youth Care World Conference will be held in January 2018 in Ventura, California (USA).  Scope of practice  Child and Youth Care practice includes skills in developing relationships, assessing needs and strengths, supporting children and families in the life space, and participating in systems interventions through direct care, supervision, administration, teaching, research, consultation and advocacy. This springs from what used to be known as children's homes or children's institutions which in turn used to part of a city's \\"charitable\\" work for children and families who had no access to professional services. Resources for this were always extremely limited and minimally staffed and the service could seldom see beyond a bed with a bedside locker and minimal food and adult attention. There was little or no staff training, with child-staff ratios often being as poor as 1:30. It was those same staff members who originally bootstrapped their own training programs by soliciting the help of well- intentioned social workers and teachers into voluntary training opportunities, and rudimentary syllabi were developed into shared coursework. Similar grassroots efforts led to the formation, for example, of the National Association of Child Care Workers in South Africa, who over the years took over much of the organisation and work of this (largely voluntary) corps of teachers and child care workers, and who established further connections with helpful professionals. Practitioners work in a variety of settings, such as early care and education, community-based child and youth development programs, parent education and family support, school-based programs, community mental health, group homes, residential centers, rehabilitation programs, pediatric health care, and juvenile justice programs. The scope of practice from the Council of Canadian Child and Youth Care Associations provides a helpful definition of the field: > \\"Child and youth care practitioners work with children, youth and families > with complex needs.

Professional associations  There are a number of professional associations for Child and Youth Care Workers around the world.  Canada  * Child and Youth Educational Accreditation Board of Canada (CYCEA) * Ontario Association of Child and Youth Care * Child and Youth Care Association Newfoundland Labrador * Nova Scotia Child and Youth Care Workers Association * Child and Youth Care Workers Association of Prince Edward Island * Child and Youth Care Association of New Brunswick * Quebec Association of Educators * Child and Youth Care Workers Association of Manitoba * Child and Youth Care Association of Alberta * Child and Youth Care Association of British Columbia * Nova Scotia Child and Youth Care Association  United States  * Association of Children's Residential Centers * Association for Child & Youth Care Practice  South Africa  * National Association of Child Care Workers  Scotland  * Scottish Residential Childcare Workers Association * Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland  Education  Education for Child and Youth Care Practitioners varies around the world. Some have formal education in Child and Youth Care while others may enter the field through another discipline or specialty. Some countries, such as Canada, have opportunities to complete a four-year programme in a university or two to three-year programme in a college leading to an advanced diploma in child and youth care which includes coursework and field placement. Some individuals enter the child and youth care field with a college diploma or university degree in a related field, such as psychology, sociology, addictions, or social service worker training. Some CYW or CYC's further their education specifically in child and youth care and hold bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in child and youth care. The University of Victoria in Canada offers a doctoral programme for child and youth workers. In the fall of 2016, Ryerson University will begin offering a Master's of CYC program. Students of Seneca College learn academic and professional values of child and youth care program as well as self-care strategies, relational practice, evidence-based research and interventions, therapeutic activities, professional and personal development. A partial list of schools offering degrees or programs in Child and Youth Care includes: * Ryerson University, School of Child and Youth Care * Seneca College Child and Youth Care * University of Victoria, School of Child and Youth Care * MacEwan University Child and Youth Care Program * University of the Fraser Valley * Flemming College, Child and Youth Care Program * Centennial College * St. Lawrence College * Fanshawe College * Lambton College * Monash South Africa  Professional certification  Professional certification is available to Child and Youth Workers through the Child and Youth Care Certification Board. Certification involves an assessment process and demonstration of high standards of care and commitment to ongoing professional development. Certification is awarded to candidates who successfully demonstrate their professional practice through: * Minimum requirements of education, experience & training * Passing score on a situational judgement exam * Provision of colleague references & supervisor assessment * Membership in a professional association * Agreement to abide by ethical practice * Completion of a written portfolio  Journals  * https://web.archive.org/web/20170420143333/http://udayancare.org/iceb- journal/home_iceb.html] Institutionalised Children and Beyond] Published by Udayan Care Child & Youth Care Online () Editors: Thom Garfat & James Freeman * Relational Child & Youth Care Practice () Editors: Heather Snell, MES CYC (c) (Professor & Program Coordinator, Bachelor of Child and Youth Care, Humber College, Ontario, Canada) & Rika Swanzen, PhD (Associate Professor, Section Head: Child and Youth Development, Monash South Africa) * Scottish Journal of Residential Child Care () Editors: Graham Connelly & Laura Steckley * Child & Youth Services () Editors: Ben Anderson-Nathe (Child and Family Studies, Portland State University, Portland, OR) & Kiaras Gharabaghi (School of Child and Youth Care, Ryerson University, Toronto) * International Journal of Social Pedagogy () Jointly published by ThemPra Social Pedagogy and the Centre for Understanding Social Pedagogy, UCL Institute of Education, London Notes Connecting With ChildExternal links * CYC-NET International Child and Youth Care Network * Council of Canadian Child and Youth Care Associations * Association for Child & Youth Care Practice Category:Community and social services occupations Category:Youth work Category:Child development ","title":"Child and Youth Care"},{"id":"7072037","text":"The Coastal Scottish Pipe Band, also known simply as 'Coastals', is a grade 3 pipe band based in Perth, Western Australia. The band was formed in 1898, and along with the City of Melbourne Highland Pipe Band is one of the oldest pipe bands in Australia. Their many recent successes include winning the 2007 New Zealand Pipe Band Championships (Grade 4), held in Dunedin. History The Coastal Scottish Pipe Band was formed in 1898 by a group of expatriate Scottish men working at the old Fremantle Railway Workshops. As one of the only pipe bands in Western Australia at this time the band called themselves 'The Gay Gordons' and adopted the Gordon tartan in their uniform. As early as 1901 it had become known as the Coastal Scottish Pipe Band., however many references after that date still called it the Fremantle Gordon Pipe Band. Their first competition entered was at the WACA Ground in 1929. An event which was, among other festivities, organised to coincide with the Centenary of Western Australia. The economic depression of the coming years was to have quite a large impact on the band. In the years following World War II, Coastals regained its full strength and by the 1950s and 60s the band was actively performing at many notable social turnouts including the first visit to WA in 1954 by the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. It was also around this time that Bon Scott, who went on to become the front man for the Australian Hard Rock band AC/DC, was a snare drummer with the band. In 1975, the band was renamed the City of South Perth Pipe Band and also adopted the Ancient MacLaine of Lochbuie clan tartan, which continues to be part of the current uniform. It was also in the coming years that the band produced the first known recording of Pipe Band music in Western Australia. In 2001, the City of South Perth council reviewed their sponsorship of the band, and on 28 August of the same year the band officially readopted their former name \\"Coastal Scottish Pipe Band WA\\". Since this time the band has had success at both state and international levels of competition. The most notable achievement in the bands short term history was winning first place in Grade 4 at the 2007 New Zealand Pipe Band championships. The band was awarded first place in the MSR, Musical Selection, Drumming, and Street March (Music), thereby winning the overall Grade 4 competition and trophies. In 2009, the band travelled to Glasgow, Scotland, to compete at the World Pipe Band Championships. Most recently in 2012, Coastals travelled to Ballarat, Victoria to compete in the Australian National Pipe Band Championships. As of early October 2008, the APBA WA branch upgraded Coastals to Grade 3.

Alternative fashion includes the fashions of specific subcultures such as emo, scene, goth subculture, hip hop, cyberpunk, and Lolita fashion;Osgersby,Bill. (2010)Fashion and Subculture: A History of Style. however, it is not limited to these. In general, alternative, or 'alt', fashion does not conform to widely popular style trends of the times that have widespread popularity. It may exhibit itself as a fringe style ‚Äì extremely attention-grabbing and more artistic than practical ‚Äì but it can also develop from anti-fashion sentiments that focus on simplistic utilitarian drives (e.g.: grunge fashion, which was largely based around comfort and availability). Historical and sociological perspectives 1911 sketch by American journalist Marguerite Martyn contrasts fashion designer Beatrice Farnham's alternative attire with that of a modern woman of that era. Alternative fashion is often considered a modern concept but it, and the concept of subculture it is often related to, have existed for centuries. As covered in Ken Gelder's exploration of the history of alternative culture patterns in Western society, \\"Subcultures: Cultural Histories and Social Practice,\\" alternative fashions have often been used to identify, and even stereotype, members of groups with value systems that diverged from common culture. Gelder states that alternative fashions have traditionally been related to subcultures that have been identified by mass society as: *disinterested in common moral order: idle, parasitical, hedonistic, criminal *disinterested in or against adhering to structure of social class *identification with an area (street, neighborhood, club) rather than self- owned property *preferring to develop \\"family\\" and community outside of traditional paradigms *attitudes against or wary of mass production, homogeneity, socially imposed behavior constrictions Those who utilize alternative fashion may vary greatly in beliefs and not identify with any of these concepts. Often it is the mass social perceptions of the meaning of certain fashions and their relation to a particular niche group that is important in understanding the interaction of alternative fashion with mass culture - a fashion is often more remembered for what it is related to in the popular consciousness than what its wearer's intended it to stand for. Particularly in a sociopolitical sense alternative fashion has often been intentionally adopted by an individual or group to display a break from the beliefs or mores of popular culture and as a form of self-expression that challenged the boundaries of what was considered appropriate, fashionable or practical.Gelder, Ken.(2007)Subcultures: Cultural Histories and Social Practice. The meaning behind a certain style, or said style even having a meaning, is up for debate between individual wearers and those outside the style. The use of subculture terminology in the 21st century to categorize or interpret dress style is often inaccurate, or at the least does not provide a complete picture of the individual being assessed by their 'look,' due to the constant evolution in the meaning, relevance and cohesion of certain subcultures and even the term 'subculture' itself.Muggleton,David.(2004)The Post-Subcultures Reader. Alternative fashion is often looked at through the lens of social politics - it is considered a visual expression of opposition to societal norms, thus heavily associated with the idealism, energy and rebellion of youth culture.Brake,Mike.(1990)Comparative Youth Culture: The Sociology of Youth Cultures and Youth Subcultures in America, Britain and Canada. Greenberg,Arielle.(2006)Youth Subcultures: Exploring Underground America. However, sociological studies into exploring alternative fashion have found individuals who retained statistically uncommon modes of dress on a permanent post-adolescent basis.Jenks, Chris. (2004) Subculture: The Fragmentation of the Social. Alternative fashion generally lays down a challenge to accepted norms, though the reactions received by wearers of alternative fashion from those who adhere to more conventional stylings can be as diverse as the wearers themselves. It can be a visual language that people employ to communicate with each other Smith,Courney & Topham,Sean. Extreme Fashion. Straw, W. (1991) \\"Systems of Articulation, Logics of Change:Communities and Scenes in Popular music\\" Cultural studies, 5 (3) :368-88 indicating common interests or involvement with similar activities, a challenge to modern conceptions of aesthetic beauty and/or a basic form of self-expression, like painting or writing.Muggleton,David.(2002)Inside Subculture: The Postmodern Meaning of Style.978-1859733523 It may be none of these things - the wearer may have no conscious intent in the choosing of their style and may find themselves outside the mainstream purely by accident. Common influences Modern individual alternative fashion genres, and their wearers, may have homogenized or diverse influences that vary from group to group and person to person but some basic similarities do exist across the scope of alt fashion. Some prominent examples of influences, regardless of genre or label, are: *vintage and retro fashion trends that have fallen out of favor with the general population (e.g.: Pin-up girl, Rockabilly, New Romanticism, Victorian fashion, etc.)which are revived or incorporated by a new generation *dress styles, traditional and modern, from other cultures (such as Japanese street fashion) Such as Harajuku, and Decora *various forms of visual and performance art, including painting, sculpture, film and television *notable personalities - authors, models, musicians, actors, etc. *personal tastes and aesthetics *personal attitudes towards concepts such as individuality, consumerism, social constructs on behavior, self-expression, and/or disenfranchisement with what is viewed as \\"normal\\" society Bennett, Andy. (2004)After Subculture: Critical Studies in Contemporary Youth Culture. Hall,Stuart.(1990) Resistance Through Rituals: Youth Subcultures in Post-War Britain. *considerations of availability and utilitarianism Like many other aspects of alternative culture, alt fashion is often heavily influenced by music and the dress style of individual bands or musicians.Schwobel, Laura.(2008)Gothic Subculture in Finland: History, Fashion and Lifestyle. While the qualities of individuality and open-mindedness are associated with alternative fashion, levels of conformity within subcultures, judgemental behaviors and expressions of feelings of superiority exist within certain alternative fashion communities just as they exist in aspects of mainstream fashion and culture. Pressure to 'fit in,' even just within a small niche community, may influence personal style.Hodkinson, Paul. (2002) Goth: Identity, Style and Subculture. Changes in availability As alternative fashion can relate to such a diverse selection of styles the acquisition of clothing, accessories and services (such as hair care) can come from a huge variety of resources, particularly as alternative fashion trends become more accepted and assimilated into mainstream culture.McKell, Iain (2004) Fashion Forever: 30 Years of Subculture. Traditionally alternative clothing, shoes and accessories have been largely procured from independently owned businesses, such as the boutiques found in bohemian and artistic districts of large urban centers. Though still popular, these type of small, specialized retailers have become displaced much like mainstream retail outlets by the Internet. Also, as fashion trends are co-opted by more and more people chain stores, which may offer a wider variety of product at a lower price and are easier to access in non-urban areas than boutiques, began to soak up a large part of the alternative fashion market. This change in the availability and commodification of alternative fashions has encouraged much broader use of styles in the mainstream once only found in niche groups. Items from thrift & vintage shops, altered and DIY fashions have also long held a place in alternative fashion to the point where the use of mismatched second-hand clothing is considered cliche to alternative and liberal ideologies.Julia Plevin. \\"Who's a Hipster?\\" Huffington Post. August 8, 2008 Mainstream attention Many forms of alternative fashion gain attention, and even notoriety, through their relationship to individuals or groups that are seen as socially undesirable ‚Äì those involved in behavior considered criminal, deviant or anti-social ‚Äì even though these types of behaviors may not be common among those involved in alternative fashion.Hebdige,Dick. (1981) Subculture: The Meaning of Style. Haenfler,Ross. (2009)Goths, Gamers, and Grrrls: Deviance and Youth Subcultures. For instance, greasers of the 1950s were associated with street gangs and random acts of juvenile violence, hippies of the 1960s (along with ravers of the 1980‚Äì90s) with promiscuity, anti-establishment agendas and, especially, drug use and those sporting hip hop style in the 1980s-now with the selling of drugs and other criminal behavior. The most headline-grabbing event in recent years related to alternative fashion was the wave of anti-Gothic policies and commentary that flooded through common culture in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre. The crime, perpetrated by two young men dressed in black trench coats who were known to be fans of heavy, dark themed music, was immediately associated with the Gothic subculture in the media despite the teens' lack of any concrete affiliation with the dress or musical style usually given this label. Policies were passed in schools across the country banning dress styles and items associated with the Gothic subculture. Many individuals who dressed in any way related to Gothic style, whether or not they associated with this subculture, were targets of fear, anger and suspicion.Kass, Jeff.(2009) Columbine: A True Crime Story, a victim, the killers and the nation's search for answers. The subculture as a whole, though extremely diverse in religious and social beliefs, was pigeonholed by the media as a dangerous influence on children.Goodlad,Lauren M.E. (2007) Goth: Undead Subculture. Alternative fashion's influence on mainstream fashion Mainstream culture, particularly retailers and the media, have often looked to alternative fashion for up and coming trends and, increasingly, as an easy way to market products to a niche group that may not be having its tastes supplied elsewhere.English, Bonnie. (2007) A Cultural History of Fashion in the Twentieth Century: From the Catwalk to the Sidewalk. Some in the alternative community view this as flattering and as a positive expansion of what is socially acceptable, and easily available, fashion. Others consider the involvement of mainstream institutions in alternative fashion as a desecration of what the concept stands for and feel the mass marketing of previously underground styles, particularly to impressionable youth markets who are more concerned with a look than the meaning behind it, amounts to a non-violent form of cultural genocide. When a previously non-mainstream style becomes popular the core group of a certain alternative niche may be watered down with dozens or even hundreds of individuals who are not genuinely invested in the advancement of alternative culture or its precepts of individuality and present an image of the subculture not at all related to its traditional members' behaviors. For instance, rave culture was heavily associated with ideas of racial, gender and sexual orientation equality and encouraged unity, creativity and individuality amongst its members.St.John, Graham.(2004).Rave culture and religion. The commodification of rave fashions in chain outlets and internet boutiques coincided with a media frenzy focusing on drug use in the rave community. These factors led to an insurgence of young people interested in emulating rave style, and obtaining the substances associated with it, rather than in promoting the utopian precepts originally associated with raves.Reynolds,Simon.(1999)Generation ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture. Alternative fashion is expressed, discussed, viewed and proliferated through many of the same channels as mainstream fashion, such as fashion shows, websites, blogs and magazines. The use of these avenues in the alt community traditionally tend to follow similar principles to traditional alt fashion itself - existing outside of mainstream outlets, fueled by personal creativity. It is common for projects related to alternative fashion to be independently run by individuals or small groups and to be offered to the public cheaply or free of charge. However, just as alternative fashion has been commodified by chain stores some level of commercialization may exist within outlets of alternative fashion seeking to exploit certain styles as 'the next big thing' or taking financial advantage of customers with limited options.

Over 700 Democrats are elected across the state of Nebraska. The party moved from a caucus to a traditional primary in 2019 that will impact the 2020 election cycle. The party voted to allow Independents to choose a Democratic ballot in the primary and their votes now count towards the Presidential nomination. The Republican Party does not allow Independents to vote. Jane Kleeb is the Chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and also serves as the Midwest Chair of the Association of State Democratic Committees.  Overview of party structure  Headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska, the Nebraska Democratic Party's State Central Committee is responsible for drafting, updating, and approving the platform of the Nebraska Democratic Party. The State Central Committee is made up of elected party leaders and State Central Committee members from each Legislative District, along with issue and constituency based caucuses.. The State Central Committee is responsible for fundraising to support the statewide operations and coordinates with county parties, candidates and the national party committees like the DNC. The SCC also publishes communication pieces for the state including items like the Rural Bill of Rights to connect with rural voters.  Party history  The Nebraska Democratic Party traces its origin to the Democratic-Republican Party founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1793. The Democratic Party itself was formed when a faction of the \\"Democratic- Republicans\\" led by Jerry Mcroy formed the party in the 1820s. Following Jackson's defeat in the election of 1824, despite having a majority of the popular vote, Jackson set about building a political coalition strong enough to defeat John Quincy Adams in the election of 1828. The coalition that he built was the foundation of the subsequent Democratic Party. Democrats dominated Nebraska until 1860. In 1890, Democrat William Jennings Bryan ran for President three times but lost every time. The state has elected more Democrats to the governor seat and into Congress. Nebraska passed a referendum in 1937 which gave it the country's only unicameral legislature known as the Nebraska Unicameral. It is a nonpartisan single-house system.Nebraska, History.com, http://www.history.com/topics/nebraska/page3, retrieved 14 December 2011 Nevertheless, despite the lack of party registration, party primaries or party-based caucusing, senators in the legislature are informally affiliated with political parties in the state by party endorsements and campaign support.  Recent elections  Nebraska has more registered Republicans than any other party. This has been true since at least 1976 when the Nebraska Secretary of State began documenting party affiliation. In 2008, Nebraska's second congressional district went for President Obama, giving him an electoral vote since Nebraska, like Maine, splits their electoral votes and is not a winner-take-all state. Notably, Nebraska's rural counties are more Republican than Democratic. The urban counties, which have a higher population base, have a smaller divide in the number of registered Republicans to Democrats. Nebraska has experienced a growing divide between registered Democratic and Republicans. In 2000, Nebraska has 145,261 more Republicans than Democrats. That number increased to 221,858. In 2019, the voter registration numbers are as follows, Republicans 576,916; Democrats 355,182; Independents/Non-Partisan 256,375; Other 15,024. In the 2016 elections, bucking national trends, Democrats flipped five seats from Republican to Democratic in the state's unicameral legislature. In 2018, over 850 Democrats ran for office and 73% won their races. In 2019, Democratic candidates dominated in the municipal city elections in Lincoln securing majorities on the city council, county commission and the Mayor's office. Nebraska Democrats gained three seats in the 2018 election. Machaela Cavanaugh defeated Theresa Thibodeau, who was appointed by Governor Pete Ricketts and Steve Lathrop defeated incumbent GOP Sen. Merv Riepe. Wendy DeBoer defeated Matt Deaver who was supported by Gov. Ricketts. Sen. DeBoer's replaced Sen. Bob Krist's seat who changed from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party. The make-up of the 2019-2020 Nebraska legislature is 18 Democrats, 1 Independent, and 30 Republicans. The Nebraska Democratic Party's report to the Federal Election Commission for May 31, 2019 states they owe $120,301.47 to vendors in outstanding debt. The majority of this debt was incurred during the 2018 election cycle. Since November 26, 2018 when the debt was first reported, only $5,678.76 has been repaid.

James Exon, Governor and Senator *Helen Boosalis, Mayor of Lincoln *Bob Kerrey, Governor and Senator *Ben Nelson, Governor and Senator  Current elected officials  As of June 2019, the Nebraska Democratic Party holds none of the state's six statewide offices, none of the state's U.S. House seats, and neither of the state's U.S. Senate seats. The Nebraska Democratic Party also does not control the Omaha mayor's office. Republican Jean Stothert defeated former state senator Heath Mello on May 9, 2017 when she was re-elected as Omaha mayor. Leirion Gaylor Baird, a Democrat, won the mayoral race in Lincoln on May 7, 2019 to replace term-limited Democrat Chris Beutler. Democrats hold majorities on both the Omaha and Lincoln city councils. State legislature State senators are elected to serve a four year term. Due to term limits, the senators can serve two consecutive terms, but they are not legally prevented from running in future elections for the same District. While Ernie Chambers frequently caucuses with the Democrats, he is a registered nonpartisan and is not a member of the Democratic Party.

Overview Historically, build automation was accomplished through makefiles. Today, there are two general categories of tools: ;Build-automation utility :This includes utilities like Make, Rake, CMake, MSBuild, Ant, Maven or Gradle (Java) etc. Their primary purpose is to generate build artifacts through activities like compiling and linking source code. ;Build-automation servers: These are general web based tools that execute build-automation utilities on a scheduled or triggered basis; a continuous integration server is a type of build-automation server. Depending on the level of automation the following classification is possible: *Makefile - level ** Make-based tools ** Non-Make- based tools * Build script (or Makefile) generation tools * Continuous- integration tools * Configuration-management tools * Meta-build tools or package managers * Other A software list for each can be found in list of build automation software. Build-automation utilities Build-automation utilities allow the automation of simple, repeatable tasks. When using the tool, it will calculate how to reach the goal by executing tasks in the correct, specific order and running each task. The two ways build tools differ are task-oriented vs. product-oriented. Task-oriented tools describe the dependency of networks in terms of a specific set task and product-oriented tools describe things in terms of the products they generate. Build- automation servers Although build servers existed long before continuous- integration servers, they are generally synonymous with continuous-integration servers, however a build server may also be incorporated into an ARA tool or ALM tool. Server types * On-demand automation such as a user running a script at the command line * Scheduled automation such as a continuous integration server running a nightly build * Triggered automation such as a continuous integration server running a build on every commit to a version-control system. Distributed build automation Automation is achieved through the use of a compile farm for either distributed compilation or the execution of the utility step. The distributed build process must have machine intelligence to understand the source-code dependencies to execute the distributed build. Relationship to continuous delivery and continuous integration Build automation is considered the first step in moving toward implementing a culture of continuous delivery and DevOps. Build automation combined with continuous integration, deployment, application-release automation, and many other processes help move an organization forward in establishing software- delivery best practices. Advantages The advantages of build automation to software development projects include * A necessary pre-condition for continuous integration and continuous testing * Improve product quality * Accelerate the compile and link processing * Eliminate redundant tasks * Minimize \\"bad builds\\" * Eliminate dependencies on key personnel * Have history of builds and releases in order to investigate issues * Save time and money - because of the reasons listed above.

He became a cardinal of the Catholic Church. Biography Hohenlohe was born in Rotenburg an der Fulda, in the Electorate of Hesse, on 26 February 1823, the son of its ruler, Franz Joseph, 5th Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst, and Princess Caroline Friederike Constanze of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.ThePeerage.com \\"Gustav Adolf Prinz zu Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst\\" His father was a Catholic, while his mother was a Lutheran. In the standard compromise of the era, he and his brothers were raised in the faith of their father, while his sisters were raised in that of their mother. His brothers were: * Victor Herzog von Ratibor (1818-1893), officer in the Prussian army, liberal politician in the Prussian- and in the German Parliament. * Chlodwig zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst (1819-1901), liberal politician, Prime Minister of Bavaria, Chancellor of the German Empire. * Konstantin zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst (1828-1896), son-in-law of Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, Erster Obersthofmeister of Emperor Franz Joseph I. of Austria. Hohenlohe took Catholic holy orders in 1849 and became in 1857 the titular bishop of Edessa in Mesopotamia and almoner to Pope Pius IX. He was appointed a cardinal in June 1866, with the titular church of Santa Maria in Traspontina.Catholic Hierarchy \\"Gustav Adolf Cardinal von Hohenlohe- Schillingsf√ºrst\\" In 1872, during the Kulturkampf, Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of the German Empire, appointed Hohenlohe as Ambassador to the Holy See, but his appointment was rejected by Pope Pius IX, possibly as a result of the open opposition he and his brothers had shown to the ultramontane position of that pope. He returned to Rome in 1876 and subsequently gained the favor of Pope Leo XIII, and went on to spend the rest of his ecclesiastical career in Italy. In July 1878 he became the archpriest of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. In May 1879 he was named the Cardinal-Bishop of Albano, which office he resigned in December 1883. A year later he was given the title of Cardinal- Priest of the Church of San Callisto, until 1895, when his title was transferred to that of San Lorenzo in Lucina.Catholic Hierarchy Grabst√§tte des Kurienkardinals Gustav Adolf zu Hohenlohe-Schillingsf√ºrst Hohenlohe died in Rome on 30 October 1896 and was buried in the Teutonic Cemetery, reserved to German nationals serving the institutions of the Church in Rome.Vatican City website \\"Teutonic Cemetery\\" Hohenlohe's period of ownership of the Villa d'Este attracted artists. His portrait was apparently painted by the Swiss- born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862-1947) during the two years he spent studying in Italy 1882-1884, and was probably signed \\"Ad. Muller\\". Its present whereabouts is unknown. The American sculptor and Rome resident Moses Jacob Ezekiel, a friend, created a bust of Hohenlohe. Hohenlohe and Liszt In October 1861 Hohenlohe was the genius behind the prevention of the marriage of Franz Liszt with Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein in the San Carlo al Corso in Rome. Thus he averted disinheritance of his brother Konstantin, husband of Carolyne‚Äôs daughter Marie. Nevertheless, he became friendly with Liszt: in April 1865 he conveyed him the tonsure, in July the Minor Orders. Besides he granted Liszt hospitality in his apartments in the Vatican, from April 1865 until June 1866 (his creation as a cardinal).Lisztomania: Liszt in RomeA.

The Kentucky Center, dedicated in 1983, located in the downtown hotel and entertainment district, is a premiere performing arts center. It features a variety of plays and concerts, and is the performance home of the Louisville Ballet, Louisville Orchestra, Broadway Across America - Louisville, Music Theatre Louisville, Stage One, KentuckyShow! and the Kentucky Opera, which is the twelfth oldest opera in the United States. The center also manages the historic W. L. Lyons Brown Theatre, which opened in 1925 and is patterned after New York's acclaimed Music Box Theatre. Actors Theatre of Louisville is another performing arts center that has become the cornerstone of the revitalization of Louisville's Main Street. As the centerpiece of the city's urban cultural district, Actors Theatre has significant economic impact on a vital downtown life. Highly acclaimed for its artistic programming and business acumen, Actors Theatre hosts the Humana Festival of New American Plays each Spring. It also presents approximately six hundred performances of about thirty productions during its year-round season, composed of a diverse array of contemporary and classical fare. It has attracted one of the largest per capita subscription audiences in the country and logs an annual attendance of over 200,000. The Louisville Palace, one of the city's venues for the Louisville Orchestra, is an elegant, ornate theatre in downtown Louisville's theatre district. In addition to orchestra performances, the theatre also features an array of popular movies, old and new, as well as concerts by popular artists. Located nearby is the Kentucky Theater, which was built in 1921 and operated for 60 years as a movie house, but was closed and was almost demolished in 1986. Ultimately it was saved by local arts advocates, and the newly renovated Kentucky Theater opened its doors in 2000 and has become a vibrant community arts center and art film house. Iroquois Park is the home of the renovated Iroquois Amphitheater which hosts a variety of musical concerts in a partially covered outdoor setting. Up through 2008, it also hosted the musical productions of Music Theatre Louisville, which moved to the Kentucky Center in 2009. The Jewish Community Center of Louisville is home to Center Stage, whose members have performed some of Broadway's best musicals. The shows range from new, hip, modern music all the way to Rodgers and Hammerstein classics. In the 2008 Season, they are introducing straight plays to their stage again with the first part of Angels in America. Louisville is home to a thriving indie music scene with bands such as the widely known Love Jones, Flaw, Slint, My Morning Jacket, Wax Fang, VHS or Beta and The Villebillies. It is also home to the post-grunge band Days of the New. On Fourth Street in downtown is the brand new Fourth Street Live! outdoor entertainment complex, which features a wide variety of restaurants, stores and nightclubs. The complex sponsors many free concerts, as does the popular Waterfront Park. The large performing arts community played a role in the relocation of ZFX Inc, the second largest theatrical flying special effects company in the world, from Las Vegas to Louisville in 2006.

In 1915, the facility was renamed as the Callan Park Mental Hospital and, again in 1976, to Callan Park Hospital. Since 1994, the facility has been formally known as Rozelle Hospital. In April 2008, all Rozelle Hospital services and patients were transferred to Concord Hospital. The restricts future uses of the site to health, tertiary education and community uses. In 2015, the Government of New South Wales approved the master plan for the site and retains ownership in consultation with the Municipality of Leichhardt pending the establishment of a trust to manage the site's ongoing use as a wellness sanctuary, encompassing health, community and educational uses. Current tenants include the Sydney College of the Arts, Writing NSW (formerly the New South Wales Writers' Centre), and New South Wales Ambulance headquarters. The current structure incorporates sandstone institutional buildings and houses that were based on designs by the colonial architects, James Barnet and Mortimer Lewis and grounds designed by botanist, Charles Moore, the founder of the Royal Botanic Gardens. The site was listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Rozelle Hospital. The Kirkbride Complex, Callan Park. One of many rock carvings in the hospital grounds, possibly the work of former patients. Indigenous, early colonial and residential use Before European settlement the Wangal clan or band lived at the site and their territory extended along the Parramatta River from about Petersham westward. The Wangal were part of the Eora or Dharug tribes. Due to a smallpox epidemic between 1789 and 1790 and European land development, only about 50 people from Dharug families were living in the Sydney area by 1900.Wayne McPhee, 2006 The first European colonisation in the district was formed by 15 land grants between 1789 and 1821. The areas west of the peninsula were slow to develop, however the later land grants were instrumental in developing Rozelle Hospital. Francis Lloyd received 50 acres in 1819, and Luke Ralph received 50 acres in 1821, naming the latter \\"Fairlight\\". These adjoining grants stretched from Long or Iron Cove to Rozelle Bay. To their west, Lawrence Butler received 100 acres in 1819.Portion 114 These grants by the 1840s were in common ownership and became Garry Owen estate, later known as Callan Park. To the west of Butler's grant was John Austen's 100 acre grant, which he received in 1819. This estate was initially called Spring Cove, but by the 1840s was known as Austenham. This was separated from the Garry Owen estate by a line formed by the extension northward of Wharf Road. Broughton Hall (built 1840s) was one of two substantial houses built on this estate: it would eventually form the adjacent \\"Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic\\", which while separate from the Callan Park Hospital for many years, would merge to form Rozelle Hospital in 1976.Tanner & Associates, 2002 Garry Owen House was built on the eponymous estate about 1839 for the estate's owner, Ryan Brenan. It was likely designed by Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis. A contemporary description of the estate noted its \\"stately wrought iron gates, unequalled in the colony, supported on handsome pillars each one a block of stone with pedestal and cap, and a beautiful serpentine approach, the avenue lined with trees and choice shrubs, 1/8 of a mile long\\". Brenan was born in Garry Owen in Ireland. He arrived in New South Wales in 1834 with his second wife. Brenan was known to Governor Bourke (who was also Irish), and appointed Brenan as Coroner in 1835 and Police Magistrate in 1836. Brenan lost his job in the 1844 depression. In 1843 a sale was held at Garry Owen of all the household's furniture. In 1845 he gave up the rights to Garry Owen estate. In either 1864 or 1865 (sources differ), Brenan sold the estate to Sydney businessman John Gordon, and moved to Maitland. Gordon renamed the property Callan Park, and in 1873 subdivided the land for auction as a new waterfront suburb. Callan Park Hospital In 1873 the Colonial Government of New South Wales purchased the Callan Park site, then known as \\"Callan Estates\\", with the purpose of building a large lunatic asylum to ease the severe overcrowding at the Gladesville Hospital for the Insane, at Bedlam Point, near Tarban Creek in Gladesville. The new lunatic asylum was designed according to the views of Dr Thomas Kirkbride, an American. Charles Moore, then Director of the Botanic Gardens, was entrusted with (re-)designing the grounds. Garry Owen House was then adapted as an asylum in 1875-86; though altered and extended, it remains substantially intact. Colonial Architect James Barnet worked with the Inspector of the Insane, Dr Frederick Norton Manning to produce a group of twenty neo-classical buildings, considerably extending the asylum operating out of the original house. These were completed in 1885 and named the Kirkbride Block. In 1912 Balmain Road was widened, necessitating the relocation of the Balmain Road boundary wall, main gates and gateposts in addition to the removal of part of the original boundary plantation. Plants were sent to Callan Park between 1909 and 1912 but there is no indication where these were planted. The re-location of the entrance gates precipitated the need to reassess the alignment of the entry drive and by the 1920s the entry drive was relocated to its current position with plantings of Canary Island palms (Phoenix canariensis) defining its edge.Kate Napier Architecture, 2013, 6-7 During World War I changes to mental health care were instigated and in 1914 patients could only be treated if they were committed into one of the major institutions, resulting in additional facilities being built in the grounds. Harry Richard Bailey (1922-1985), psychiatrist, Harry enrolled in science at the University of Sydney in 1940. Lacking money, he did not finish the course and found work as a pharmacist's assistant. He studied medicine at the University of Sydney (MB, BS, 1951; DPM, 1954), winning the Norton Manning memorial prize for psychiatry and the Major Ian Vickery prize for paediatrics. After twelve months at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Bailey became a medical officer at Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic, Leichhardt, in 1952. That year he was appointed assistant-director of psychiatric clinical services in the Department of Public Health. He had already come under the influence of such prominent advocates of surgical and pharmacological treatments for mental illness as (Sir) William Trethowan and Cedric Swanton. From December 1954 he spent fifteen months on a World Health Organisation fellowship in the United States of America and Europe, closely observing the sedation techniques, psychosurgery and electroconvulsive therapy methods of Ewan Cameron in Canada, William Sargant in London and Lars Leksell in Sweden. On his recommendation, the Cerebral Surgery and Research Unit at Callan Park Mental Hospital was established in 1957. Bailey was named director. There he experimented with new ECT and psychosurgical methods, announcing significant developments in the successful treatment of mental illness. In 1952 Bailey was assistant director of clinical psychiatry for the public health service. Between 1962 and 1979, he served as chief psychiatrist at Chelmsford Private Hospital, Pennant Hills, northwest of Sydney. Under his care, 26 Chelmsford patients died.[5] Callan Park Hospital for the Insane merged with the adjacent Broughton Hall Psychiatric Clinic in 1976 to form Rozelle Hospital. De- institutional care The Kirkbride complex continued to be used for the housing and treatment of patients until 1994, when the last remaining services were transferred to other buildings in the Callan Park grounds, towards the Broughton Hall at the southern end of the site. Many patients were also transferred into buildings in the local community, in line with the policy of the State Government (see The Richmond Report of 1983 which accelerated the move towards de-institutionalising care), creating a number of social and moral problems. In 2007 it was reported that the Minister for Planning, Frank Sartor had announced in Parliament that the University of Sydney and the Government had commenced discussions about the future use of Callan Park. The University and the Government proposed to enter into a memorandum of understanding and then a lease. In June 2008, Rozelle Hospital services and patients were transferred to Concord Hospital. In the face of strong community opposition, by October 2008 the Government rejected the University's plans to accommodate up to 6,000 students on the Callan Park site and announced that of the site would be handed to Leichhardt Council. Current use The parklands are currently open to the public for use and enjoyment in accordance with the principal objects of the Callan Park (Special Provisions) Act 2002. The restricts future uses of the site to health, tertiary education, and community (not-for-profit). Commercial (profit-making) activity in Callan Park is disallowed under the Act. After a period of extensive renovation, the Kirkbride Complex which housed the former hospital, the Sydney College of the Arts, the fine arts campus of the University of Sydney, commenced occupancy under a 99‚Äìyear lease. It was later revealed in Sartor's biography, The Fog on the Hill - How NSW Labor Lost its Way, that the Keneally-led NSW Government secretly planned to compensate Sydney University on the 'loss' of Callan Park by offering it the North Eveleigh site in Redfern, which had been prepared for tender. However, it was reported that the North Eveleigh site had been prepared for the market and was valued at about 100 million. Cabinet had also approved the proceeds of the North Eveleigh sale to go towards a major upgrade of Redfern Station. Yet the university was only prepared to pay some $30 million, and so the 'deal' didn't go ahead. Other tenants include Writing NSW, formerly the New South Wales Writers' Centre, and the New South Wales Ambulance headquarters. In November 2011, the Leichhardt Council and the Friends of Callan Park formally presented the Draft Callan Park Master Plan to the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Brad Hazzard . In 2015, the New South Wales Parliament approved the draft masterplan and agreed to establish a specialised trust, finalise the site's master plan and develop a sustainable long-term funding model to protect it. It was envisaged that the Callan Park and Broughton Hall Trust would manage the site, comprising the following trustees appointed by the Governor: *an appointee to represent the traditional owners; *three appointees on the recommendation of the Premier to represent the relevant NSW Government Ministers in relation to Heritage, Health and Environmental considerations; *three appointees on the recommendation of relevant local Council area, at least 1 of who has expertise in heritage; *an appointee to represent mental health consumers; *an appointee from the local council area to represent the Friends of Callan Park; *an appointee to represent educational/arts tenants/lessees; *an appointee from the local council area to represent sporting bodies; and *an appointee to represent not- for-profit organisations which are tenants/lessees. The government did not proceed with these plans, and in 2015, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage was delegated management of several precincts in Callan Park.  Description  Rozelle Hospital site is 61 hectares of undulating waterfront parkland site, with complexes of buildings clustered across it, and diverse landscape elements and plantings. The site incorporates many layers of archaeological, Aboriginal, historic, cultural, aesthetic and environmental heritage. It contains many heritage buildings, including two of the original houses (1839 and 1842) of the three original estates on which it is based: and the magnificent Kirkbride Block, completed in 1885 for the Callan Park Psychiatric Hospital, and now the campus of the Sydney College of the Arts. Garry Owen House (now Writing NSW) This, the first building on the site, c.1840, was built on a curved earth terrace projecting from the slope (the edge of the sandstone ridge where the land begins to fall away at the top of the slopes) with commanding views over Iron Cove. It was originally a grand private residence and prominent in Leichhardt society (1991 Heritage Study of Rozelle Hospital). It retains some early estate and garden layout, showing the influence of English pattern books on laying out a garden - with axial approach to the front door with a carriage loop. Garryowen also retains some early plantings, such as an old (1.5m trunk girth) evergreen or Southern magnolia /bull bay, (M.grandiflora) and a Camellia japonica cv. (double red with a fleck of white) west of the house's main garden front (western side) in front of Garry Owen Cottage (1880s, designed by Government Architect James Barnet for male convalescent patients. Four mature jacarandas (J.mimosifolia) and 3 cabbage tree palms (Livistona australis) and a cedar wattle (Acacia elata) are to Garryowen's north. A Cordyline stricta, Western Australian peppermint (Agonis flexuosa) and a hedge of Cape plumbago (P.capensis) are to the house's north-east. To the north are a Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), 3 Bhutan cypresses (Cupressus torulosa) and a Norfolk Island hibiscus tree (Lagunaria patersonia. To the west are more jacaranda trees. The house has two main front rooms (drawing room and dining room) accessed through sliding doors from a central hall, enabling the opening of both right up into a large single ballroom, similar to that of Government House (which Mortimer Lewis had implemented, overseeing the plans prepared by English architect, Edmund Blore. It shows Lewis' architectural trademarks, such as reeded, rather than fluted mouldings in the tops of window cases, floor skirtings are panelled, French doors onto the verandahs (onto the entrance front (north) and garden front (west) sides of the house (these doors were later changed by James Barnet to hung windows). The octagonal asphalt paving blocks on the verandah floors are a trademark of James Barnet, also seen at his Police & Justice Museum near Circular Quay and South West Rocks Lighthouse. The Library and another room are divided by sliding doors. A gardener's cottage has 6 rooms. The original small cottage has been incorporated into the present mid-Victorian two storey building. Additions have been made to the east and south. The stair hall has a fine Neoclasical interior and domed ceiling, with stained glass inserts. There is a centrally placed entrance on the north elevation with elegant fanlight and classically detailed moulded entablature. It is constructed of rendered brick ashlar coursed single-storey verandah with timber supports and posts, corrugated iron roofed. The main roof is of galvanised iron, hidden behind the parapet. Extensive brick additions to the east which have been rendered and painted (1992, Preliminary Heritage & Conservation Register - Central District Area Health Service). Garry Owen Cottage (1880s) This was designed by Government Architect James Barnet for male convalescent patients is of sandstone, sited on the edge (west) of Garryowen's earth platform, and together with the group of Convalescent Cottages (zone 5) forms part of the deliberately composed picturesque setting for the Kirkbride Block. Also there is a small male attendant's cottage designed by Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon in the zone. Kirkbride Complex The Kirkbride complex sits proud on a high ridge on the site to the north east of Garryowen's grounds. It is a magnificent sandstone complex of buildings and courtyards, surrounded by walls and has (hidden boundary lines behind 'sunk fences'). The complex was completed in 1885 for the government-run Callan Park Psychiatric Hospital. This complex has more recently been used by Sydney University as a campus of the Sydney College of the Arts. Heritage listing On 2 April 2017 the area and buildings were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following statement of significance: The building was also listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

He served as the Lebanese representative to the United Nations, the President of the Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations General Assembly, a member of the Lebanese Cabinet, a national minister of Education and the Arts, and of Foreign Affairs and Emigration, and theologian. He was responsible for the drafting and adoption of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Birth and education Charles Malik's statue in the American University of Science and Technology's campus in Beirut, Lebanon. Born in Btourram, Lebanon, Malik was the son of Dr. Habib Malik and Zarifa Karam. Malik was the great-nephew of the renowned author Farah Antun. Malik was educated at the American Mission School for Boys, now Tripoli Evangelical School for Girls and Boys in Tripoli and the American University of Beirut, where he graduated with a degree in mathematics and physics. He moved on to Cairo in 1929, where he developed an interest in philosophy, which he proceeded to study at Harvard (under Alfred North Whitehead) and in Freiburg, Germany under Martin Heidegger in 1932. His stay in Germany, however, was short-lived. He found the policies of the Nazis unfavorable, and left soon after they came to power in 1933. In 1937, he received his Ph.D. in philosophy (based on metaphysics in the philosophies of Whitehead and Heidegger) from Harvard University. He taught there as well as at other universities in the United States. After returning to Lebanon, Malik founded the Philosophy Department at the American University of Beirut, as well as a cultural studies program (the 'civilization sequence program',Now: Civilization Studies Program, AUB http://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cvsp/Pages/index.aspx now 'Civilization Studies Program'). He remained in this capacity until 1945 when he was appointed to be the Lebanese Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations.  In the United Nations Malik represented Lebanon at the San Francisco conference at which the United Nations was founded. He served as a rapporteur for the Commission on Human Rights in 1947 and 1948, when he became President of the Economic and Social Council. The same year, he helped to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with Chair and President of the Human Rights Commission, U.S. Delegate to the U.N. General Assembly, Eleanor Roosevelt. He succeeded Mrs. Roosevelt as the Human Rights Commission's Chair. He remained as ambassador to the US and UN until 1955. He was an outspoken participant in debates in the United Nations General Assembly and often criticized the Soviet Union. After a three-year absence, he returned in 1958 to preside over the thirteenth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Roles in Lebanon Meanwhile, Malik had been appointed to the Lebanese Cabinet. He was Minister of National Education and Fine Arts in 1956 and 1957, and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1956 to 1958. While a Minister, he was elected to the National Assembly in 1957, and served there for three years. Following the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War, which raged from 1975 to 1990, Malik helped to found the Front for Freedom and Man in Lebanon, which he named as such, to defend the Christian cause. It was later renamed the Lebanese Front. A Greek Orthodox Christian, he was the only non-Maronite among the Front's top leaders, who included Phalangist Party founder Pierre Gemayel and former President and National Liberal Party leader Camille Chamoun. Malik was widely regarded as the brains of the Front, in which the other politicians were the brawn. Malik was also noted as a theologian who successfully reached across confessional lines, appealing to his fellow Eastern Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and Evangelicals alike. The author of numerous commentaries on the Bible and on the writings of the early Church Fathers, Malik was one of the few Orthodox theologians of his time to be widely known in Evangelical circles, and the evangelical leader Bill Bright spoke well of him and quoted him. Partly owing to Malik's ecumenical appeal, as well as to his academic credentials, he served as President of the World Council on Christian Education from 1967 to 1971, and as Vice-President of the United Bible Societies from 1966 to 1972. Malik also famously worked alongside fellow Lebanese diplomat and philosopher Karim Azkoul. He is related to founder of postcolonialism Edward Said through marriage. At a UN session in December 1948, Malik described Lebanon as follows: > \\"The history of my country for centuries is precisely that of a small > country struggling against all odds for the maintenance and strengthening of > real freedom of thought and conscience. Innumerable persecuted minorities > have found, throughout the ages, a most understanding haven in my country, > so that the very basis of our existence is complete respect of differences > of opinion and belief.\\" Academic career Malik returned to his academic career in 1960. He traveled extensively, lectured on human rights and other subjects, and held professorships at a number of American universities including Harvard, the American University in Washington, DC, Dartmouth College (New Hampshire), University of Notre Dame (Indiana). In 1981, he was also a Pascal Lecturer at the University of Waterloo in Canada. His last official post was with The Catholic University of America (Washington, DC), where he served as a Jacques Maritain Distinguished Professor of Moral and Political Philosophy from 1981 to 1983. He also returned to his old chair in Philosophy at the American University of Beirut (1962 to 1976) and was appointed Dean of Graduate Studies. Malik has been awarded a world record of 50 honorary degrees; the originals are in his archives in Notre Dame University-Louaize, Lebanon. Death Malik died of complications due to kidney failure, secondary to atheroembolic disease sustained after a cardiac catheterization, performed at the Mayo Clinic two years earlier, in Beirut on 28 December 1987. His son, Habib Malik, is a prominent academic (with expertise in the history of ideas, and associate professor in the humanities division at the Lebanese American University) and also a human rights activist. He was also survived by his brother, the late Father Ramzi Habib Malik, a prominent Catholic priest who worked tirelessly for the cause of Christian reconciliation with the Jewish people as well as for the belief that the Jewish People are the elder brothers of the Christians. Malik's personal papers are housed in Notre Dame University-Louaize, Lebanon, where 200 of his personal papers and books are stored, and in the Library of Congress, Washington D.C., where his heritage occupies 44 meters of shelves in the special collection area.

In particular, he is known as the co-founder of Burns Philp and Company, a shipping and trading company, and for establishing the Burnside Presbyterian Homes for Children in North Parramatta (now known as UnitingCare Burnside), a children and family welfare organisation. Early life Burns was born at Polmont, Stirlingshire, Scotland, the son of a merchant, David Burns, and educated at Newington Academy and the Royal High School in Edinburgh. He migrated to Queensland in 1862 and worked for three years in Western Queensland as a jackaroo. In 1865 he formed a Brisbane store, Burns & Scott, in partnership with his brother, and established the first stores in Gympie and nearby One Mile Creek and Kilkivan in 1867, when gold was found there. He then sold his interests and returned to Scotland in 1870 after the death of his father. He briefly visited France as an observer and assistant in relief efforts after the Paris Commune of 1871 before returning to Queensland. Business and other activities In 1871, Burns returned to North Queensland to establish a new trading company in Townsville. He later loaned Robert Philp enough money to become a partner in the enterprise. The company thrived through ownership of sail and steam powered trading ships, initially leased to ensure a steady supply of goods between Queensland and Sydney. This formed the basis of the Queensland Steam Shipping Company Limited, later amalgamated into Burns Philp and Company, which remains as a major trading company today. The shipping expanded into various ports in the East Indies and the Pacific Islands, and the company branched into various trading endeavours throughout the following decades. In addition to establishing Burns Philp and Company, his business interests include serving as chairman of the (North) Queensland Insurance Co. Ltd in 1886‚Äì1923, the New South Wales Mortgage, Land, and Agency Co. and the Solomon Islands Development Co. Ltd. He was also a director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the Sydney Exchange Co., the Bank of North Queensland, and various collieries, as well as owning extensive Queensland pastoral properties. Burns served on a royal commission of inquiry into railway administration in 1906 and was appointed to the Legislative Council of New South Wales in 1908. He joined the Parramatta troop of the 1st Light Horse Regiment (New South Wales Lancers) as a trooper in June 1891 and was immediately promoted Captain, and became Major in January 1896. From September 1897 to June 1903 he commanded the regiment as its Lieutenant-Colonel. He was promoted to Colonel in July 1903 and commanded the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade until January 1907, when he retired. Burns was president of the Caledonian Society for twenty years. During World War I Burns helped establish a scheme for insuring enlisted men with dependants, personally contributing ¬£2000 a year during the duration of the war. Later life From the 1880s, Burns was based at a property known as Gowan Brae, North of Parramatta. He retired from government and business activities due to ill health in 1908, and lived at Gowan Brae from that time on. Shortly afterwards, he approached the Presbyterian Church of Australia, suggesting that they establish a Presbyterian home for children. In 1910 he endowed some of the Gowan Brae property, to establish the Presbyterian Homes for Children (later renamed Burnside and currently known as UnitingCare Burnside) and was chairman of its board for ten years. It became his passion in his \\"retired\\" years, as he made numerous contributions towards new homes and the children. His business and government connections ensured that donations from other sources were also forthcoming, with houses named after sponsors and officially opened by dignitaries. Burns continued to live at Gowan Brae until his death and was buried there in a family cemetery. He left the property to his son, James, but suggested that, should James not need the property, it should be given to the (then) Burnside Presbyterian Orphans Homes. James honoured this request, and the property was donated. Much of the land has since been sold or leased to other organisations, or as residential developments. The property immediately around Gowan Brae is now owned by The King's School, while sections of the property are now owned by the Redeemer Baptist School and Tara Anglican School for Girls, with some still owned by the Synod of New South Wales and the ACT of the Uniting Church in Australia for Burnside's own operations and the synod's activities such as the archives, Camden Library and the Uniting Theological College.

In a spark ignition internal combustion engine, Ignition timing refers to the timing, relative to the current piston position and crankshaft angle, of the release of a spark in the combustion chamber near the end of the compression stroke. The need for advancing (or retarding) the timing of the spark is because fuel does not completely burn the instant the spark fires. The combustion gases take a period of time to expand and the angular or rotational speed of the engine can lengthen or shorten the time frame in which the burning and expansion should occur. In a vast majority of cases, the angle will be described as a certain angle advanced before top dead center (BTDC). Advancing the spark BTDC means that the spark is energized prior to the point where the combustion chamber reaches its minimum size, since the purpose of the power stroke in the engine is to force the combustion chamber to expand. Sparks occurring after top dead center (ATDC) are usually counter-productive (producing wasted spark, back- fire, engine knock, etc.) unless there is need for a supplemental or continuing spark prior to the exhaust stroke. Setting the correct ignition timing is crucial in the performance of an engine. Sparks occurring too soon or too late in the engine cycle are often responsible for excessive vibrations and even engine damage. The ignition timing affects many variables including engine longevity, fuel economy, and engine power. Many variables also affect what the 'best' timing is. Modern engines that are controlled in real time by an engine control unit use a computer to control the timing throughout the engine's RPM and load range. Older engines that use mechanical distributors rely on inertia (by using rotating weights and springs) and manifold vacuum in order to set the ignition timing throughout the engine's RPM and load range. Early cars required the driver to adjust timing via controls according to driving conditions, but this is now automated. There are many factors that influence proper ignition timing for a given engine. These include the timing of the intake valve(s) or fuel injector(s), the type of ignition system used, the type and condition of the spark plugs, the contents and impurities of the fuel, fuel temperature and pressure, engine speed and load, air and engine temperature, turbo boost pressure or intake air pressure, the components used in the ignition system, and the settings of the ignition system components. Usually, any major engine changes or upgrades will require a change to the ignition timing settings of the engine. Background The spark ignition system of mechanically controlled gasoline internal combustion engines consist of a mechanical device, known as a distributor, that triggers and distributes ignition spark to each cylinder relative to piston position--in crankshaft degrees relative to top dead centre (TDC). Spark timing, relative to piston position, is based on static (initial or base) timing without mechanical advance. The distributor's centrifugal timing advance mechanism makes the spark occur sooner as engine speed increases. Many of these engines will also use a vacuum advance that advances timing during light loads and deceleration, independent of the centrifugal advance. This typically applies to automotive use; marine gasoline engines generally use a similar system but without vacuum advance. In mid-1963, Ford offered transistorized ignition on their new 427 FE V8. This system only passed a very low current through the ignition points, using a PNP transistor to perform high-voltage switching of the ignition current, allowing for a higher voltage ignition spark, as well as reducing variations in ignition timing due to arc-wear of the breaker points. Engines so equipped carried special stickers on their valve covers reading ‚Äú427-T.‚Äù AC Delco‚Äôs Delcotron Transistor Control Magnetic Pulse Ignition System became optional on a number of General Motors vehicles beginning in 1964. The Delco system eliminated the mechanical points completely, using magnetic flux variation for current switching, virtually eliminating point wear concerns. In 1967, Ferrari and Fiat Dinos came equipped with Magneti Marelli Dinoplex electronic ignition, and all Porsche 911s had electronic ignition beginning with the B-Series 1969 models. In 1972, Chrysler introduced a magnetically- triggered pointless electronic ignition system as standard equipment on some production cars, and included it as standard across the board by 1973. Electronic control of ignition timing was introduced a few years later in 1975-'76 with the introduction of Chrysler's computer-controlled \\"Lean-Burn\\" electronic spark advance system. By 1979 with the Bosch Motronic engine management system, technology had advanced to include simultaneous control of both the ignition timing and fuel delivery. These systems form the basis of modern engine management systems. Setting the ignition timing Typical dependency of effective power (Pe) and specific fuel consumption on the ignition timing. The optimal setting (red) exists in every engine regime. Timing light \\"Timing advance\\" refers to the number of degrees before top dead center (BTDC) that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber during the compression stroke. Retarded timing can be defined as changing the timing so that fuel ignition happens later than the manufacturer's specified time. For example, if the timing specified by the manufacturer was set at 12 degrees BTDC initially and adjusted to 11 degrees BTDC, it would be referred to as retarded. In a classic ignition system with breaker points, the basic timing can be set statically using a test light or dynamically using the timing marks and a timing light. Timing advance is required because it takes time to burn the air-fuel mixture. Igniting the mixture before the piston reaches TDC will allow the mixture to fully burn soon after the piston reaches TDC. If the air-fuel mixture is ignited at the correct time, maximum pressure in the cylinder will occur sometime after the piston reaches TDC allowing the ignited mixture to push the piston down the cylinder with the greatest force. Ideally, the time at which the mixture should be fully burnt is about 20 degrees ATDC. This will maximize the engine's power producing potential. If the ignition spark occurs at a position that is too advanced relative to piston position, the rapidly expanding air- fuel mixture can actually push against the piston still moving up, causing knocking (pinking or pinging) and possible engine damage, this usually occurs at low RPM and is known as pre-ignition or in severe cases detonation. If the spark occurs too retarded relative to the piston position, maximum cylinder pressure will occur after the piston is already traveling too far down the cylinder. This results in lost power, overheating tendencies, high emissions, and unburned fuel. The ignition timing will need to become increasingly advanced (relative to TDC) as the engine speed increases so that the air-fuel mixture has the correct amount of time to fully burn. As the engine speed (RPM) increases, the time available to burn the mixture decreases but the burning itself proceeds at the same speed, it needs to be started increasingly earlier to complete in time. Poor volumetric efficiency at higher engine speeds also requires increased advancement of ignition timing. The correct timing advance for a given engine speed will allow for maximum cylinder pressure to be achieved at the correct crankshaft angular position. When setting the timing for an automobile engine, the factory timing setting can usually be found on a sticker in the engine bay. The ignition timing is also dependent on the load of the engine with more load (larger throttle opening and therefore air:fuel ratio) requiring less advance (the mixture burns faster). Also it is dependent on the temperature of the engine with lower temperature allowing for more advance. The speed with which the mixture burns depends on the type of fuel, the amount of turbulence in the airflow (which is tied to the design the cylinder head and valvetrain system) and on the air- fuel ratio. It is a common myth that burn speed is linked with octane rating. Dynamometer tuning Setting the ignition timing while monitoring engine power output with a dynamometer is one way to correctly set the ignition timing. After advancing or retarding the timing, a corresponding change in power output will usually occur. A load type dynamometer is the best way to accomplish this as the engine can be held at a steady speed and load while the timing is adjusted for maximum output. Using a knock sensor to find the correct timing is one method used to tune an engine. In this method, the timing is advanced until knock occurs. The timing is then retarded one or two degrees and set there. This method is inferior to tuning with a dynomometer since it often leads to ignition timing which is excessively advanced particularly on modern engines which don't require as much advance to deliver peak torque. With excessive advance, the engine will be prone to pinging and detonation when conditions change (fuel quality, temperature, sensor issues, etc). After achieving the desired power characteristics for a given engine load/rpm, the spark plugs should be inspected for signs of engine detonation. If there are any such signs, the ignition timing should be retarded until there are none. The best way to set ignition timing on a load type dynamometer is to slowly advance the timing until peak torque output is reached. Some engines (particularly turbo or supercharged) will not reach peak torque at a given engine speed before they begin to knock (pinging or minor detonation). In this case, engine timing should be retarded slightly below this timing value (known as the \\"knock limit\\"). Engine combustion efficiency and volumetric efficiency will change as ignition timing is varied, which means fuel quantity must also be changed as the ignition is varied. After each change in ignition timing, fuel is adjusted also to deliver peak torque. Mechanical ignition systems Mechanical ignition systems use a mechanical spark distributor to distribute a high voltage current to the correct spark plug at the correct time. In order to set an initial timing advance or timing retard for an engine, the engine is allowed to idle and the distributor is adjusted to achieve the best ignition timing for the engine at idle speed. This process is called 'setting the base advance'. There are two methods of increasing timing advance past the base advance. The advances achieved by these methods are added to the base advance number in order to achieve a total timing advance number. Mechanical timing advance Distributor weights An increasing mechanical advancement of the timing takes place with increasing engine speed. This is possible by using the law of inertia. Weights and springs inside the distributor rotate and affect the timing advance according to engine speed by altering the angular position of the timing sensor shaft with respect to the actual engine position. This type of timing advance is also referred to as centrifugal timing advance. The amount of mechanical advance is dependent solely on the speed at which the distributor is rotating. In a 2-stroke engine, this is the same as engine RPM. In a 4-stroke engine, this is half the engine RPM. The relationship between advance in degrees and distributor RPM can be drawn as a simple 2-dimensional graph. Lighter weights or heavier springs can be used to reduce the timing advance at lower engine RPM. Heavier weights or lighter springs can be used to advance the timing at lower engine RPM. Usually, at some point in the engine's RPM range, these weights contact their travel limits, and the amount of centrifugal ignition advance is then fixed above that rpm. Vacuum timing advance The second method used to advance (or retard) the ignition timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method is almost always used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor with respect to the distributor shaft. Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance. One source for vacuum advance is a small opening located in the wall of the throttle body or carburetor adjacent to but slightly upstream of the edge of the throttle plate. This is called a ported vacuum. The effect of having the opening here is that there is little or no vacuum at idle, hence little or no advance. Other vehicles use vacuum directly from the intake manifold. This provides full engine vacuum (and hence, full vacuum advance) at idle. Some vacuum advance units have two vacuum connections, one at each side of the actuator membrane, connected to both manifold vacuum and ported vacuum. These units will both advance and retard the ignition timing. On some vehicles, a temperature sensing switch will apply manifold vacuum to the vacuum advance system when the engine is hot or cold, and ported vacuum at normal operating temperature. This is a version of emissions control; the ported vacuum allowed carburetor adjustments for a leaner idle mixture. At high engine temperature, the increased advance raised engine speed to allow the cooling system to operate more efficiently. At low temperature the advance allowed the enriched warm-up mixture to burn more completely, providing better cold-engine running. Electrical or mechanical switches may be used to prevent or alter vacuum advance under certain conditions. Early emissions electronics would engage some in relation to oxygen sensor signals or activation of emissions-related equipment. It was also common to prevent some or all of the vacuum advance in certain gears to prevent detonation due to lean-burning engines. Computer- controlled ignition systems Newer engines typically use computerized ignition systems. The computer has a timing map (lookup table) with spark advance values for all combinations of engine speed and engine load. The computer will send a signal to the ignition coil at the indicated time in the timing map in order to fire the spark plug. Most computers from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) cannot be modified so changing the timing advance curve is not possible. Overall timing changes are still possible, depending on the engine design. Aftermarket engine control units allow the tuner to make changes to the timing map. This allows the timing to be advanced or retarded based on various engine applications. A knock sensor may be used by the ignition system to allow for fuel quality variation.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants. Casilla throws four pitches: a fastball, slider, curveball, and changeup. Professional career Minor Leagues Casilla was originally signed by the Oakland A's on January 31, 2000, as an amateur free agent, and pitched from then through under the name of Jairo Garcia. During spring training in he revealed his real name to be Santiago Casilla, and that he had used false documents which listed him as three years younger than his actual age when he first signed in 2000. Oakland Athletics (2004‚Äì2009) Casilla pitched small parts of , , and for the Athletics as a reliever. In , Casilla was recalled by the Athletics from Triple-A after going 2‚Äì1 with a 4.13 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 24 innings. He stepped into a bullpen that had Huston Street, Justin Duchscherer, and Kiko Calero on the disabled list. Casilla started off well, going 2‚Äì1 with 2 saves and a 0.45 ERA in his first 16 games. But he wound up finishing the season with a 3‚Äì1 record and a 4.44 ERA in 46 games. He pitched in the A's bullpen in the 2008 and 2009 seasons with mixed success. San Francisco Giants (2010‚Äì2016) At the end of 2009, he was granted free agency by the A's and signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants for 2010. He made his Giants debut on May 21, 2010 against his former team in Oakland and remained with the team for the remainder of the season until they won the World Series. He returned to the Giants for 2011 as a member of the bullpen and took over as its closer after Brian Wilson went on the disabled list in August. Casilla picked up his first career base hit, a bases loaded, two out RBI ground ball single between Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and Aaron Hill on September 14, 2012. Casilla was the winning pitcher in Game 4 of the 2012 World Series as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers. On December 17, 2012, Casilla re-signed with the Giants for 3 years at $15 million. On May 28, 2013, Casilla underwent knee surgery to remove a cyst and was placed on the 15-day DL. On May 17, 2015, in a 9‚Äì8 win over the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park, Casilla entered the bottom on the ninth inning and struck out three batters on nine pitches, thus recording an immaculate save. Casilla was the third San Francisco Giant in franchise history to pitch an immaculate inning, joining Trevor Wilson and Orel Hershiser. On April 25, 2016, Casilla successfully logged his 100th save, closing 1 & 1/3 innings against the San Diego Padres. In 2016 he saved 31 games, but tied for the major league lead in blown saves, with nine.Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2016 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Standard Statistics FanGraphs Baseball Return to Oakland On January 20, 2017, Casilla signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Oakland Athletics. He served as the A's closer to begin the season before being removed as closer. He was 16/23 in save opportunities. In 59 innings, he had an ERA of 4.27 with 57 strikeouts. He was designated for assignment on July 14, 2018. Colorado Rockies Casilla signed a minor league deal with Colorado on July 26 after being released by the Athletics on July 19. He elected free agency on November 3, 2018. Scouting Casilla works with a prototypical power pitcher repertoire, chiefly throwing a low to mid-90s two-seam fastball and a hard- breaking slider. He also occasionally mixes in a curveball and changeup. However, at times, he struggles with control of his pitches.

Findlay Market is Ohio‚Äôs oldest continuously-operated public market and one of Cincinnati‚Äôs most notable institutions. The market is the last remaining market among the many that once served Cincinnati. \\"Cincinnati chili\\" is \\"one of this nation's most distinctive regional plates of food,\\" according to national food writers Jane and Michael Stern. It is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce served over spaghetti or hot dogs at several chains such as Skyline Chili, Gold Star Chili, Empress Chili, and Dixie Chili plus independents such as Camp Washington Chili. The chili is best appreciated not in a bowl, as one would with the chunkier, \\"Tex-Mex\\" chili, but rather, as a sauce to cover a plate of spaghetti, covered in shredded cheddar cheese (3-way), the latter with onions or beans (4-way) or with both (as a 5-way), all topped off with oyster crackers and to some, hot sauce. It can also be placed on top of a hot dog in a steamed bun with mustard and onions, and topped with cheddar cheese (referred to as a cheese coney). Findlay Market Findlay Market is the oldest continuously-operated public market in the state of Ohio. Goetta Goetta is a meat-and-grain sausage or mush of German inspiration that is popular in the greater Cincinnati area. It is primarily composed of ground meat (pork, or pork and beef), pin-head oatmeal and spices formed into a loaf and then sliced and fried, often in butter, \\"to a melt-in-the-mouth tenderness.\\" Graeter's Graeter's is a regional chain of ice cream parlors that also sells baked goods and candies. It was founded by Louis \\"Charlie\\" and Regina Graeter, husband-and-wife immigrants from Bavaria, in 1870, and grew into a chain under Regina's leadership following her husband's death. The Graeter family still runs the chain, which has spread beyond the Cincinnati area with chain-owned and franchised locations in several regional metropolitan areas, plus one store on the Las Vegas Strip. Pints of the ice cream are also sold in grocery stores in all U.S. states except Hawaii and the Dakotas. Oprah Winfrey is a fan of Graeter's and caused sales to skyrocket when she raved about the ice cream on her show.

Known originally as Donderfliegen (translated into band speak as 'darn that fly'), the band changed names to Deitiphobia in 1991 to better clarify the band's focus on Christianity. The band's name means \\"Fear of God\\". History Early years (1990‚Äì1992) Deitiphobia was initially formed in 1990 under the name Donderfliegen by artists Wally Shaw and Brent Stackhouse. They released a demo album, Digital Priests, on their own independent label, Slava Music. The name change from Donderfliegen to Deitiphobia was first announced on-stage at the Cornerstone New Band Showcase performance of 1991. Their first major release, Fear of God, was released later that year when the band was signed to Blonde Vinyl Records. Slava Music subsequently became a sub-label of Blonde Vinyl. A remix of the band's independent first release, Digital Priests - the Remixes followed in 1992 on the new Slava Music sub- label, and became known as Deitiphobia's unofficial second album. 1992 also brought a change in the line-up when Stackhouse parted ways with the band to form Wigtop with his vocalist wife, Heather - which released its first and only album, Revelation 1921 that year on Blonde Vinyl ‚Äì Slava Music. Stackhouse went on to be involved with the electronic dance band X-Propagation with Bryon Payne. The band released one spiritual warfare themed album, Conflict, in 1993. Reformation (1993‚Äì1998) After Shaw and Stackhouse separated, Shaw relocated to Chicago to continue with Deitiphobia releases. Shaw's fianc√©, Sheri Swaback (later Sheri Shaw) stepped in to fill the keyboard and vocals position in Deitiphobia. Joined with guitarist and percussionist Josh Plemon, the band released Clean on Myx Records in 1994. The following year brought Fear of the Digital Remix. The album was more of a project by former Blonde Vinyl head and alternative artist Michael Knott than an effort by the band. For the album, Knott remixed elements of the band's first two albums into new compositions. The band also featured another new member at live performances, former Sorrow of Seven guitarist Kevin 131. The Shaws spent the later half of the 90's focused on their industrial rock side project Massivivid (originally known as Vivid), formed in 1996. Unlike the electronic sound of Deitiphobia, Massivivid featured a more guitar-driven sound. Subsequently, the band won a Dove Award for its debut album, Brightblur, released in 1998. Comeback (1999‚Äì2001) Deitiphobia was relaunched in 1999 with Wil Foster, who was a member of Massivivid and also founded techno band Sheltershed. The band's fourth official studio album, Lo:Fi.Vs.Sci:Fi, was released on N*Soul Records that year. Wally Shaw went on to run a remix competition on MP3.com in 2000, where he released the source material under the name DPHB3K.DPHB3K at Discogs After the competition three subsequent versions of a remix album, Persist! Remix!, were released on MP3.com, along with Vivaphobia - Medium.Rare, a collection of demos and miscellaneous tracks by Deitiphobia and Massivivid. The following year the original Donderfliegen demo was re-released as Donderfliegen by Millennium Eight Records. Aftermath (2002‚Äì2007) Shortly after the launch of Lo:Fi.Vs.Sci:Fi, Sheri Shaw left both Deitiphobia and Massivivid. As of September 2007 she has been working on a new project, Sstaria, alongside Lyte of industrial / progressive trance band Delta-S, following a collaboration on the song \\"Erase\\" from the album Voyage to Isis. In 2007 Foster and Wally Shaw also independently released a Deitiphobia compilation album titled Sweet:Hereafter. However, contrary to speculation, Wally confirmed that Deitiphobia would not be making a comeback, although they did continue to write for Massivivid.

Rather than a direct causal relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, a mediation model proposes that the independent variable influences the (non-observable) mediator variable, which in turn influences the dependent variable. Thus, the mediator variable serves to clarify the nature of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.MacKinnon, D. P. (2008). Introduction to Statistical Mediation Analysis. New York: Erlbaum. Mediation analyses are employed to understand a known relationship by exploring the underlying mechanism or process by which one variable influences another variable through a mediator variable.Cohen, J.; Cohen, P.; West, S. G.; Aiken, L. S. (2003) Applied multiple regression/correlation analysis for the behavioral sciences (3rd ed.). Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. In particular, mediation analysis can contribute to better understanding the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable when these variables do not have an obvious direct connection. Baron and Kenny's (1986) steps for mediation Baron and Kenny (1986) Baron, R. M. and Kenny, D. A. (1986) \\"The Moderator-Mediator Variable Distinction in Social Psychological Research - Conceptual, Strategic, and Statistical Considerations\\", Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 51(6), pp. 1173-1182. laid out several requirements that must be met to form a true mediation relationship. They are outlined below using a real-world example. See the diagram above for a visual representation of the overall mediating relationship to be explained. Note: Hayes (2009) critiqued Baron and Kenny's mediation steps approach, and as of 2019, David A. Kenny on his website stated that mediation can exist in the absence of a 'significant' total effect, and therefore step 1 below may not be needed. This situation is sometimes referred to as \\"inconsistent mediation\\". Later publications by Hayes also questioned the concepts of full or partial mediation and advocated for these terms, along with the classical mediation steps approach outlined below, to be abandoned. Step 1: :Regress the dependent variable on the independent variable to confirm that the independent variable is a significant predictor of the dependent variable. : Independent variable \\\\to dependent variable :: Y=\\\\beta_{10} +\\\\beta_{11}X + \\\\varepsilon_1 * Œ≤11 is significant Step 2: :Regress the mediator on the independent variable to confirm that the independent variable is a significant predictor of the mediator. If the mediator is not associated with the independent variable, then it couldn‚Äôt possibly mediate anything. : Independent variable \\\\to mediator :: Me=\\\\beta_{20} +\\\\beta_{21}X + \\\\varepsilon_2 * Œ≤21 is significant Step 3: :Regress the dependent variable on both the mediator and independent variable to confirm that a) the mediator is a significant predictor of the dependent variable, and b) the strength of the coefficient of the previously significant independent variable in Step #1 is now greatly reduced, if not rendered nonsignificant. :: Y=\\\\beta_{30} +\\\\beta_{31}X +\\\\beta_{32}Me + \\\\varepsilon_3 * Œ≤32 is significant * Œ≤31 should be smaller in absolute value than the original effect for the independent variable (Œ≤11 above) Example The following example, drawn from Howell (2009),Howell, D. C. (2009). Statistical methods for psychology (7th ed.). Belmot, CA: Cengage Learning. explains each step of Baron and Kenny's requirements to understand further how a mediation effect is characterized. Step 1 and step 2 use simple regression analysis, whereas step 3 uses multiple regression analysis. Step 1: :How you were parented (i.e., independent variable) predicts how confident you feel about parenting your own children (i.e., dependent variable). : How you were parented \\\\to confidence in own parenting abilities. Step 2: :How you were parented (i.e., independent variable) predicts your feelings of competence and self-esteem (i.e., mediator). : How you were parented \\\\to Feelings of competence and self-esteem. Step 3: :Your feelings of competence and self- esteem (i.e., mediator) predict how confident you feel about parenting your own children (i.e., dependent variable), while controlling for how you were parented (i.e., independent variable). Such findings would lead to the conclusion implying that your feelings of competence and self-esteem mediate the relationship between how you were parented and how confident you feel about parenting your own children. Note: If step 1 does not yield a significant result, one may still have grounds to move to step 2. Sometimes there is actually a significant relationship between independent and dependent variables but because of small sample sizes, or other extraneous factors, there could not be enough power to predict the effect that actually exists (See Shrout & Bolger, 2002 for more info). Direct versus indirect effects Direct Effect in a Mediation Model In the diagram shown above, the indirect effect is the product of path coefficients \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". The direct effect is the coefficient \\" C' \\". The direct effect measures the extent to which the dependent variable changes when the independent variable increases by one unit and the mediator variable remains unaltered. In contrast, the indirect effect measures the extent to which the dependent variable changes when the independent variable is held fixed and the mediator variable changes by the amount it would have changed had the independent variable increased by one unit. Indirect Effect in a Simple Mediation Model: The indirect effect constitutes the extent to which the X variable influences the Y variable through the mediator. In linear systems, the total effect is equal to the sum of the direct and indirect (C' + AB in the model above). In nonlinear models, the total effect is not generally equal to the sum of the direct and indirect effects, but to a modified combination of the two. Full versus partial mediation A mediator variable can either account for all or some of the observed relationship between two variables. Full mediation Maximum evidence for mediation, also called full mediation, would occur if inclusion of the mediation variable drops the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable (see pathway c in diagram above) to zero. Full Mediation Model Partial mediation The Partial Mediation Model Includes a Direct Effect Partial mediation maintains that the mediating variable accounts for some, but not all, of the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable. Partial mediation implies that there is not only a significant relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable, but also some direct relationship between the independent and dependent variable. In order for either full or partial mediation to be established, the reduction in variance explained by the independent variable must be significant as determined by one of several tests, such as the Sobel test. The effect of an independent variable on the dependent variable can become nonsignificant when the mediator is introduced simply because a trivial amount of variance is explained (i.e., not true mediation). Thus, it is imperative to show a significant reduction in variance explained by the independent variable before asserting either full or partial mediation. It is possible to have statistically significant indirect effects in the absence of a total effect. This can be explained by the presence of several mediating paths that cancel each other out, and become noticeable when one of the cancelling mediators is controlled for. This implies that the terms 'partial' and 'full' mediation should always be interpreted relative to the set of variables that are present in the model. In all cases, the operation of \\"fixing a variable\\" must be distinguished from that of \\"controlling for a variable,\\" which has been inappropriately used in the literature. The former stands for physically fixing, while the latter stands for conditioning on, adjusting for, or adding to the regression model. The two notions coincide only when all error terms (not shown in the diagram) are statistically uncorrelated. When errors are correlated, adjustments must be made to neutralize those correlations before embarking on mediation analysis (see Bayesian Networks). Sobel's test As mentioned above, Sobel's test is performed to determine if the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable has been significantly reduced after inclusion of the mediator variable. In other words, this test assesses whether a mediation effect is significant. It examines the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable compared to the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable including the mediation factor. The Sobel test is more accurate than the Baron and Kenny steps explained above; however, it does have low statistical power. As such, large sample sizes are required in order to have sufficient power to detect significant effects. This is because the key assumption of Sobel's test is the assumption of normality. Because Sobel's test evaluates a given sample on the normal distribution, small sample sizes and skewness of the sampling distribution can be problematic (see Normal distribution for more details). Thus, the rule of thumb as suggested by MacKinnon et al., (2002) is that a sample size of 1000 is required to detect a small effect, a sample size of 100 is sufficient in detecting a medium effect, and a sample size of 50 is required to detect a large effect. Preacher and Hayes (2004) bootstrap method The bootstrapping method provides some advantages to the Sobel's test, primarily an increase in power. The Preacher and Hayes Bootstrapping method is a non-parametric test (See Non- parametric statistics for a discussion on non parametric tests and their power). As such, the bootstrap method does not violate assumptions of normality and is therefore recommended for small sample sizes. Bootstrapping involves repeatedly randomly sampling observations with replacement from the data set to compute the desired statistic in each resample. Computing over hundreds, or thousands, of bootstrap resamples provide an approximation of the sampling distribution of the statistic of interest. Hayes offers a macro that calculates bootstrapping directly within SPSS, a computer program used for statistical analyses. This method provides point estimates and confidence intervals by which one can assess the significance or nonsignificance of a mediation effect. Point estimates reveal the mean over the number of bootstrapped samples and if zero does not fall between the resulting confidence intervals of the bootstrapping method, one can confidently conclude that there is a significant mediation effect to report. Significance of mediation As outlined above, there are a few different options one can choose from to evaluate a mediation model. Bootstrapping is becoming the most popular method of testing mediation because it does not require the normality assumption to be met, and because it can be effectively utilized with smaller sample sizes (N < 25). However, mediation continues to be most frequently determined using the logic of Baron and Kenny \\"Mediation\\". davidakenny.net. Retrieved April 25, 2012. or the Sobel test. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to publish tests of mediation based purely on the Baron and Kenny method or tests that make distributional assumptions such as the Sobel test. Thus, it is important to consider your options when choosing which test to conduct. Approaches to mediation While the concept of mediation as defined within psychology is theoretically appealing, the methods used to study mediation empirically have been challenged by statisticians and epidemiologists and interpreted formally.Pearl, J. (2001) \\"Direct and indirect effects\\". Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, Morgan Kaufmann, 411-420. (1) Experimental-causal- chain design An experimental-causal-chain design is used when the proposed mediator is experimentally manipulated. Such a design implies that one manipulates some controlled third variable that they have reason to believe could be the underlying mechanism of a given relationship. (2) Measurement-of- mediation design A measurement-of-mediation design can be conceptualized as a statistical approach. Such a design implies that one measures the proposed intervening variable and then uses statistical analyses to establish mediation. This approach does not involve manipulation of the hypothesized mediating variable, but only involves measurement. Criticisms of mediation measurement Experimental approaches to mediation must be carried out with caution. First, it is important to have strong theoretical support for the exploratory investigation of a potential mediating variable. A criticism of a mediation approach rests on the ability to manipulate and measure a mediating variable. Thus, one must be able to manipulate the proposed mediator in an acceptable and ethical fashion. As such, one must be able to measure the intervening process without interfering with the outcome. The mediator must also be able to establish construct validity of manipulation. One of the most common criticisms of the measurement-of-mediation approach is that it is ultimately a correlational design. Consequently, it is possible that some other third variable, independent from the proposed mediator, could be responsible for the proposed effect. However, researchers have worked hard to provide counter-evidence to this disparagement. Specifically, the following counter-arguments have been put forward: (1) Temporal precedence. For example, if the independent variable precedes the dependent variable in time, this would provide evidence suggesting a directional, and potentially causal, link from the independent variable to the dependent variable. (2) Nonspuriousness and/or no confounds. For example, should one identify other third variables and prove that they do not alter the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable he/she would have a stronger argument for their mediation effect. See other 3rd variables below. Mediation can be an extremely useful and powerful statistical test; however, it must be used properly. It is important that the measures used to assess the mediator and the dependent variable are theoretically distinct and that the independent variable and mediator cannot interact. Should there be an interaction between the independent variable and the mediator one would have grounds to investigate moderation. Other third variables (1) Confounding: :Another model that is often tested is one in which competing variables in the model are alternative potential mediators or an unmeasured cause of the dependent variable. An additional variable in a causal model may obscure or confound the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Potential confounders are variables that may have a causal impact on both the independent variable and dependent variable. They include common sources of measurement error (as discussed above) as well as other influences shared by both the independent and dependent variables. Mediation model with two covariates In experimental studies, there is a special concern about aspects of the experimental manipulation or setting that may account for study effects, rather than the motivating theoretical factor. Any of these problems may produce spurious relationships between the independent and dependent variables as measured. Ignoring a confounding variable may bias empirical estimates of the causal effect of the independent variable. (2) Suppression: :A suppressor variable increases the predictive validity of another variable when included in a regression equation. Suppression can occur when a single causal variable is related to an outcome variable through two separate mediator variables, and when one of those mediated effects is positive and one is negative. In such a case, each mediator variable suppresses or conceals the effect that is carried through the other mediator variable. For example, higher intelligence scores (a causal variable, A) may cause an increase in error detection (a mediator variable, B) which in turn may cause a decrease in errors made at work on an assembly line (an outcome variable, X); at the same time, intelligence could also cause an increase in boredom (C), which in turn may cause an increase in errors (X). Thus, in one causal path intelligence decreases errors, and in the other it increases them. When neither mediator is included in the analysis, intelligence appears to have no effect or a weak effect on errors. However, when boredom is controlled intelligence will appear to decrease errors, and when error detection is controlled intelligence will appear to increase errors. If intelligence could be increased while only boredom was held constant, errors would decrease; if intelligence could be increased while holding only error detection constant, errors would increase. In general, the omission of suppressors or confounders will lead to either an underestimation or an overestimation of the effect of A on X, thereby either reducing or artificially inflating the magnitude of a relationship between two variables. (3) Moderators: :Other important third variables are moderators. Moderators are variables that can make the relationship between two variables either stronger or weaker. Such variables further characterize interactions in regression by affecting the direction and/or strength of the relationship between X and Y. A moderating relationship can be thought of as an interaction. It occurs when the relationship between variables A and B depends on the level of C. See moderation for further discussion. Moderated mediation Mediation and moderation can co-occur in statistical models. It is possible to mediate moderation and moderate mediation. Moderated mediation is when the effect of the treatment A on the mediator and/or the partial effect B on the dependent variable depend in turn on levels of another variable (moderator). Essentially, in moderated mediation, mediation is first established, and then one investigates if the mediation effect that describes the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable is moderated by different levels of another variable (i.e., a moderator). This definition has been outlined by Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005) and Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007).Preacher, K. J., Rucker, D. D. & Hayes, A. F. (2007). Assessing moderated mediation hypotheses: Strategies, methods, and prescriptions. Multivariate Behavioral Research, 42, 185-227. Models of moderated mediation There are five possible models of moderated mediation, as illustrated in the diagrams below. # In the first model the independent variable also moderates the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable. # The second possible model of moderated mediation involves a new variable which moderates the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator (the A path). # The third model of moderated mediation involves a new moderator variable which moderates the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable (the B path). # Moderated mediation can also occur when one moderating variable affects both the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator (the A path) and the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable (the B path). # The fifth and final possible model of moderated mediation involves two new moderator variables, one moderating the A path and the other moderating the B path. { centre|thumbFirst option: independent variable moderates the B path. centre|thumbSecond option: fourth variable moderates the A path. centre|thumbThird option: fourth variable moderates the B path. centre|thumbFourth option: fourth variable moderates both the A path and the B path. centre|thumbFifth option: fourth variable moderates the A path and a fifth variable moderates the B path. |} Mediated moderation Mediated moderation is a variant of both moderation and mediation. This is where there is initially overall moderation and the direct effect of the moderator variable on the outcome is mediated. The main difference between mediated moderation and moderated mediation is that for the former there is initial (overall) moderation and this effect is mediated and for the latter there is no moderation but the effect of either the treatment on the mediator (path A) is moderated or the effect of the mediator on the outcome (path B) is moderated. In order to establish mediated moderation, one must first establish moderation, meaning that the direction and/or the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables (path C) differs depending on the level of a third variable (the moderator variable). Researchers next look for the presence of mediated moderation when they have a theoretical reason to believe that there is a fourth variable that acts as the mechanism or process that causes the relationship between the independent variable and the moderator (path A) or between the moderator and the dependent variable (path C). Example The following is a published example of mediated moderation in psychological research. Participants were presented with an initial stimulus (a prime) that made them think of morality or made them think of might. They then participated in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG), in which participants pretend that they and their partner in crime have been arrested, and they must decide whether to remain loyal to their partner or to compete with their partner and cooperate with the authorities. The researchers found that prosocial individuals were affected by the morality and might primes, whereas proself individuals were not. Thus, social value orientation (proself vs. prosocial) moderated the relationship between the prime (independent variable: morality vs. might) and the behaviour chosen in the PDG (dependent variable: competitive vs. cooperative). The researchers next looked for the presence of a mediated moderation effect. Regression analyses revealed that the type of prime (morality vs. might) mediated the moderating relationship of participants‚Äô social value orientation on PDG behaviour. Prosocial participants who experienced the morality prime expected their partner to cooperate with them, so they chose to cooperate themselves. Prosocial participants who experienced the might prime expected their partner to compete with them, which made them more likely to compete with their partner and cooperate with the authorities. In contrast, participants with a pro-self social value orientation always acted competitively. Regression equations for moderated mediation and mediated moderation Muller, Judd, and Yzerbyt (2005) outline three fundamental models that underlie both moderated mediation and mediated moderation. Mo represents the moderator variable(s), Me represents the mediator variable(s), and Œµi represents the measurement error of each regression equation. A simple statistical mediation model. Step 1: Moderation of the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y), also called the overall treatment effect (path C in the diagram). : Y=\\\\beta_{40} +\\\\beta_{41}X +\\\\beta_{42}Mo +\\\\beta_{43}XMo + \\\\varepsilon_4 * To establish overall moderation, the Œ≤43 regression weight must be significant (first step for establishing mediated moderation). * Establishing moderated mediation requires that there be no moderation effect, so the Œ≤43 regression weight must not be significant. Step 2: Moderation of the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator (path A). : Me=\\\\beta_{50} +\\\\beta_{51}X +\\\\beta_{52}Mo +\\\\beta_{53}XMo + \\\\varepsilon_5 * If the Œ≤53 regression weight is significant, the moderator affects the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator. Step 3: Moderation of both the relationship between the independent and dependent variables (path A) and the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable (path B). : Y=\\\\beta_{60} +\\\\beta_{61}X +\\\\beta_{62}Mo +\\\\beta_{63}XMo +\\\\beta_{64}Me +\\\\beta_{65}MeMo + \\\\varepsilon_6 * If both Œ≤53 in step 2 and Œ≤63 in step 3 are significant, the moderator affects the relationship between the independent variable and the mediator (path A). * If both Œ≤53 in step 2 and Œ≤65 in step 3 are significant, the moderator affects the relationship between the mediator and the dependent variable (path B). * Either or both of the conditions above may be true. Causal mediation analysis Fixing versus conditioning Mediation analysis quantifies the extent to which a variable participates in the transmittance of change from a cause to its effect. It is inherently a causal notion, hence it cannot be defined in statistical terms. Traditionally, however, the bulk of mediation analysis has been conducted within the confines of linear regression, with statistical terminology masking the causal character of the relationships involved. This led to difficulties, biases, and limitations that have been alleviated by modern methods of causal analysis, based on causal diagrams and counterfactual logic. The source of these difficulties lies in defining mediation in terms of changes induced by adding a third variables into a regression equation. Such statistical changes are epiphenomena which sometimes accompany mediation but, in general, fail to capture the causal relationships that mediation analysis aims to quantify. The basic premise of the causal approach is that it is not always appropriate to \\"control\\" for the mediator M when we seek to estimate the direct effect of X on Y (see the Figure above). The classical rationale for \\"controlling\\" for M\\" is that, if we succeed in preventing M from changing, then whatever changes we measure in Y are attributable solely to variations in X and we are justified then in proclaiming the effect observed as \\"direct effect of X on Y.\\" Unfortunately, \\"controlling for M\\" does not physically prevent M from changing; it merely narrows the analyst's attention to cases of equal M values. Moreover, the language of probability theory does not possess the notation to express the idea of \\"preventing M from changing\\" or \\"physically holding M constant\\". The only operator probability provides is \\"Conditioning\\" which is what we do when we \\"control\\" for M, or add M as a regressor in the equation for Y. The result is that, instead of physically holding M\\" constant (say at M = m) and comparing Y for units under X = 1' to those under X = 0, we allow M to vary but ignore all units except those in which M achieves the value M = m. These two operations are fundamentally different, and yield different results, except in the case of no omitted variables. To illustrate, assume that the error terms of M and Y are correlated. Under such conditions, the structural coefficient B and A (between M and Y and between Y and X) can no longer be estimated by regressing Y on X and M. In fact, the regression slopes may both be nonzero even when C is zero. This has two consequences. First, new strategies must be devised for estimating the structural coefficients A,B and C. Second, the basic definitions of direct and indirect effects must go beyond regression analysis, and should invoke an operation that mimics \\"fixing M\\", rather than \\"conditioning on M.\\" Definitions Such an operator, denoted do(M = m), was defined in Pearl (1994) and it operates by removing the equation of M and replacing it by a constant m. For example, if the basic mediation model consists of the equations: : X=f(\\\\varepsilon_1),~~M=g(X,\\\\varepsilon_2),~~Y=h(X,M,\\\\varepsilon_3) , then after applying the operator do(M = m) the model becomes: : X=f(\\\\varepsilon_1),~~M=m,~~Y=h(X,m,\\\\varepsilon_3) and after applying the operator do(X = x) the model becomes: : X=x, M=g(x, \\\\varepsilon_2), Y=h(x,M,\\\\varepsilon_3) where the functions f and g, as well as the distributions of the error terms Œµ1 and Œµ3 remain unaltered. If we further rename the variables M and Y resulting from do(X = x) as M(x) and Y(x), respectively, we obtain what came to be known as \\"potential outcomes\\" or \\"structural counterfactuals\\". These new variables provide convenient notation for defining direct and indirect effects. In particular, four types of effects have been defined for the transition from X = 0 to X = 1: (a) Total effect ‚Äì : TE = E [Y(1) - Y(0)] (b) Controlled direct effect - : CDE(m) = E [Y(1,m) - Y(0,m) ] (c) Natural direct effect - : NDE = E [Y(1,M(0)) - Y(0,M(0))] (d) Natural indirect effect : NIE = E [Y(0,M(1)) - Y(0,M(0))] Where E[ ] stands for expectation taken over the error terms. These effects have the following interpretations: * TE measures the expected increase in the outcome Y as X changes from X=0 to X =1, while the mediator is allowed to track the change in X as dictated by the function M = g(X, Œµ2). * CDE measures the expected increase in the outcome Y as X changes from X = 0 to X = 1, while the mediator is fixed at a pre-specified level M = m uniformly over the entire population * NDE measures the expected increase in Y as X changes from X = 0 to X = 1, while setting the mediator variable to whatever value it would have obtained under X = 0, i.e., before the change. * NIE measures the expected increase in Y when the X is held constant, at X = 1, and M changes to whatever value it would have attained (for each individual) under X = 1. * The difference TE-NDE measures the extent to which mediation is necessary for explaining the effect, while the NIE measures the extent to which mediation is sufficient for sustaining it. A controlled version of the indirect effect does not exist because there is no way of disabling the direct effect by fixing a variable to a constant. According to these definitions the total effect can be decomposed as a sum : TE = NDE - NIE_r where NIEr stands for the reverse transition, from X = 1 to X = 0; it becomes additive in linear systems, where reversal of transitions entails sign reversal. The power of these definitions lies in their generality; they are applicable to models with arbitrary nonlinear interactions, arbitrary dependencies among the disturbances, and both continuous and categorical variables. The mediation formula Formulation of the indirect effect In linear analysis, all effects are determined by sums of products of structural coefficients, giving : \\\\begin{align} TE & = C + AB \\\\\\\\\\\\ CDE(m) & = NDE = C, \\\\text{ independent of } m\\\\\\\\\\\\ NIE & = AB. \\\\end{align} Therefore, all effects are estimable whenever the model is identified. In non- linear systems, more stringent conditions are needed for estimating the direct and indirect effects . For example, if no confounding exists, (i.e., Œµ1, Œµ2, and Œµ3 are mutually independent) the following formulas can be derived: : \\\\begin{align} TE & = E(Y\\\\mid X=1)- E(Y\\\\mid X=0)\\\\\\\\\\\\ CDE(m) & = E(Y\\\\mid X=1, M=m) - E(Y\\\\mid X=0, M=m) \\\\\\\\\\\\ NDE & = \\\\sum_m [E(Y|X=1, M=m) - E(Y\\\\mid X=0, M=m) ] P(M=m\\\\mid X=0) \\\\\\\\\\\\ NIE & = \\\\sum_m [P(M=m\\\\mid X=1) - P(M=m\\\\mid X=0)] E(Y\\\\mid X=0, M=m). \\\\end{align} The last two equations are called Mediation Formulas and have become the target of estimation in many studies of mediation. They give distribution-free expressions for direct and indirect effects and demonstrate that, despite the arbitrary nature of the error distributions and the functions f, g, and h, mediated effects can nevertheless be estimated from data using regression. The analyses of moderated mediation and mediating moderators fall as special cases of the causal mediation analysis, and the mediation formulas identify how various interactions coefficients contribute to the necessary and sufficient components of mediation. A serial mediation model with two mediator variables. Example A conceptual diagram that depicts a parallel mediation model with two mediator variables. Assume the model takes the form : \\\\begin{align} X & = \\\\varepsilon_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ M & = b_0 + b_1X + \\\\varepsilon_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ Y & = c_0 + c_1X + c_2M + c_3XM + \\\\varepsilon_3 \\\\end{align} where the parameter c_3 quantifies the degree to which M modifies the effect of X on Y. Even when all parameters are estimated from data, it is still not obvious what combinations of parameters measure the direct and indirect effect of X on Y, or, more practically, how to assess the fraction of the total effect TE that is explained by mediation and the fraction of TE that is owed to mediation. In linear analysis, the former fraction is captured by the product b_1 c_2 / TE, the latter by the difference (TE - c_1)/TE, and the two quantities coincide. In the presence of interaction, however, each fraction demands a separate analysis, as dictated by the Mediation Formula, which yields: : \\\\begin{align} NDE & = c_1 + b_0 c_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ NIE & = b_1 c_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ TE & = c_1 + b_0 c_3 + b_1(c_2 + c_3) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = NDE + NIE + b_1 c_3. \\\\end{align} Thus, the fraction of output response for which mediation would be sufficient is : \\\\frac{NIE}{TE} = \\\\frac{b_1 c_2}{c_1 + b_0 c_3 + b_1 (c_2 + c_3)}, while the fraction for which mediation would be necessary is : 1- \\\\frac{NDE}{TE} = \\\\frac{b_1 (c_2 +c_3)}{c_1 + b_0c_3 + b_1 (c_2 + c_3)}. These fractions involve non-obvious combinations of the model's parameters, and can be constructed mechanically with the help of the Mediation Formula. Significantly, due to interaction, a direct effect can be sustained even when the parameter c_1 vanishes and, moreover, a total effect can be sustained even when both the direct and indirect effects vanish. This illustrates that estimating parameters in isolation tells us little about the effect of mediation and, more generally, mediation and moderation are intertwined and cannot be assessed separately.

Directed by Richard Lester, it starred Sellers, Milligan, Valentine Dyall, Kenneth Connor and Graham Stark - principle contributors it shared with The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d, a comedy show which had finished only a month before. Its five 30 minute episodes were made by Associated-Rediffusion for ITV and broadcast only in the London area. It was predominantly a sketch comedy, attempting to translate the audio antics of The Goon Show into visual antics in bizarre and often surreal comedy sketches. Jazz harmonica player Max Geldray had a music segment in the show, reprising his role from The Goon Show, and Canadian star Patti Lewis had a singing spot. Performers including Mario Fabrizi, Ernest Clark, Patricia Driscoll, Jon Jon Keefe, Jennifer Lautrec and John Vyvyan had roles over the show's run. Contemporary celebrities such as Hans and Lotte Hass were parodied. There were a few taboos, with sketches showing people in various states of undress, cameramen, behind the scenes workers and the studios. The \\"Ying Tong Song\\", written by Milligan, served as the show's opening theme, and became a hit on the UK Singles Chart when released in September 1956. A Show Called Fred provoked strong reactions upon broadcast for its unusual content. The People reported that the show had received more telephone complaints than any other ITV show for being difficult to understand. Reviewing the programme in the Daily Mirror, Clifford Davis described it as \\"the most meaningless, weird, un-funny piffle ever to have been perpetrated on TV\\". In other quarters, the show garnered critical acclaim. Kenneth Baily of The People described it as \\"a new approach to TV fun\\" and \\"just as original as the Goons and radio's inimitable It's That Man Again\\". Writing for Truth, Denis Thomas singled out the show from any other comedy show on television, describing it as \\"so televisually funny: this, for once, is a variety programme which owes nothing at all to gramophone records or to the Palladium, or even to cabaret\\". Thomas's comments were echoed by Truth's Bernard Levin, who noted that the show had been \\"hailed in many quarters as not only the funniest thing that has ever been seen on television, but as the first programmes to exploit the full resources of the newest medium in a manner which owes nothing to the methods of any older one\\". It was followed by Son of Fred later in 1956. A half-hour special, Best of Fred, was broadcast on 18 September 1963 combining surviving sketches from A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. The 1995 convention of the Goon Show Preservation Society was billed as A Weekend Called Fred, followed in 2003 by its successor, the Great Grandson of a Weekend Called Fred, held in Egham, Surrey. As of 2020, the series's fifth episode is available to stream on BFI Player.

Its construction and equipment costs were covered by a gift of $7,000 by Dr. George C. Shattuck, Dartmouth class of 1803, who stipulated that the Trustees match the gift with an additional $4,000.

The group's mission reads in part: ‚ÄúNew York City Audubon is a grassroots community that works for the protection of wild birds and habitat in the five boroughs, improving the quality of life for all New Yorkers.‚Äù With nearly 10,000 members, it is one of the largest organizations in the Audubon movement. It is named in honor of John James Audubon, an ornithologist and naturalist who shot, painted, catalogued, and described the Birds of North America. In recent years, New York City Audubon has exercised particular influence in two areas: the restoration of the red-tailed hawk Pale Male's nest and the fatal effects of light pollution and glass windows on migratory birds. Pale Male New York City Audubon organized the protests that followed the removal of the hawk Pale Male‚Äôs nest in December, 2004 and played a major role in negotiating a solution with the co-op board of 927 Fifth Avenue. Although Pale Male and his mate, Lola, continued to nest at the site. No new chicks fledged in subsequent years. In 2008, NYC Audubon recruited experts from around the country to assess the problem, and removed pigeon spikes from the nest structure as a result of their recommendations.Gothamist: Improving Pale Male and Lola's Fifth Avenue Nest In 2011, Pale Male, with a new mate, successfully fledged two chicks,Pale Male Irregulars Blog July 17, 2011: http://palemaleirregulars.blogspot.com/2011_07_17_archive.html suggesting that fertility issues were the likely cause of the nest failure from 2005‚Äì2010. Project Safe Flight Each year, tens of thousands of birds are killed in North America by flying into windows. In 1997 New York City Audubon launched Project Safe Flight, modeled after Toronto‚Äôs Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP), to work toward long-term solutions for the bird collision problem. From the program's inception through 2013, field volunteers have found more than 6,000 dead or injured birds of more than 100 species. The most frequently harmed species include white-throated sparrows, common yellowthroats, and ovenbirds. Project Safe Flight works with building owners and managers to address site-specific threats to migratory birds and is working with politicians, architects, glass manufacturers and others to seek long-term solutions. Prior to 9/11, World Trade Center management, at New York City Audubon's request, placed protective netting around the lower floors of 1 WTC and 2 WTC. The netting acted somewhat like a trampoline ‚Äî instead of striking the glass, the birds just bounced off, unharmed. In September, 2006, Project Safe Flight began a comprehensive study aimed at quantifying the magnitude of the bird collision problem in New York City as well as identifying the main factors involved in such collisions. Dr. Daniel Klem of Muhlenberg College, an international authority on the bird collision topic, is leading the study. The project, funded by a grant from US Fish and Wildlife Service with matching funds from corporations and individuals, relies on local citizen scientists to monitor nearly 80 sites in Manhattan over the course of two migration seasons. Over 20 volunteers are involved in the monitoring effort Lights Out New York Light pollution contributes to bird collisions. In 2005 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs administration endorsed a voluntary New York City Audubon program that encourages tall buildings to turn out external lights between midnight and 6 AM and shield interior lights as well. The Chrysler Building, Bank of America Tower, and New York Times Building are among the nearly 100 buildings participating in the program.Lights Out NY http://www.nycaudubon.org/home/lightsout.shtml Urban Green Council Blog on Lights Out NY: http://blog.urbangreencouncil.org/2011/08/lights-out-new-york- save-energy-save-birds/ Harbor Herons Project Unknown to most, even to many birdwatchers, the small islands of the highly commercialized and heavily developed New York/New Jersey Estuary are home to one of the Atlantic Coast's largest colonies of nesting herons ‚Äì with more than 3,000 individuals.

Hawaii  Tina Marie Machado was born in Hawaii in 1960, one of four children of Marie and Harold Machado, a military family. Harold served multiple tours in Korea and Vietnam, earning a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Silver Star. Marie moved where the Army told them, and often raised the family alone. Tina Machado graduated Waipahu High School, then earned a Bachelor's degree in International business from the University of Washington in 1980. She worked as a model, and had multiple minor acting roles in the television series Hawaiian Heat, Magnum, P.I., and the film Aloha Summer (1988). Machado was crowned Miss Hawaii USA in February 1985. She lost the title less than a week later, when pageant officials said that at 25 she was too old, and was directed to step down in favor of Toni Leimomi Costa, 18, her runner-up. Machado had already given up her job at the Honolulu Board of Realtors because of needing to devote time for the contest. Slightly longer form as Machado sued for $5 million for breach of contract, and was restored to the title in April. She competed in the Miss USA 1985 pageant in Lakeland, Florida, in May as Miss Hawaii USA and was a semi-finalist in the nationally televised pageant (won by Laura Martinez Harring of Texas). Toni Costa competed again next year and won Miss Hawaii USA 1986. In 1987, Machado married Hawaii restaurateur Aaron Placourakis, taking his last name. His brother, Yanni Placourakis, also a restaurateur, subsequently married Pamela Kimura, Miss Hawaii 1992. Tina and Aaron Placourakis had three children together, and regularly appeared in Hawaii society columns. Their son Jesse won three gold medals in national karate competition at age 7, and a title at the All-Japan Junior Championships at the age of 8, in 1999. Tina Placourakis followed her son to karate lessons, earning a black belt, and also winning multiple medals in national karate.  Arizona  In 2000, Tina Placourakis left Hawaii to live in Arizona with former major league baseball player Charles \\"Chili\\" Davis, taking the three children, and getting an amicable divorce. In 2002, Placourakis and Davis bought a house in North Scottsdale, Arizona, that she would later remodel and have featured in Phoenix Home & Garden magazine. In 2003, Tina Placourakis filed civil suit against Davis, for assault, battery, and money spent on the house. She testified about physical and mental abuse, and played a tape recorded phone conversation of him saying \\"Tina, you deserved to get hit\\". The jury awarded her $350,000 in damages. Alt URL In 2006, Placourakis appeared as \\"The Divorced Mom\\", on the CBS reality television program Tuesday Night Book Club, where she was described as a former beauty queen and karate champion, the oldest of seven Scottsdale, Arizona women who gathered to discuss their lives and relationships. The show was pulled after two episodes out of its scheduled eight due to poor ratings. In 2007, Tina Marie Placourakis was working for the Sherman Oaks, California-based Diversified Lending Group, when it bought Phoenix, Arizona-based private label water bottling company, Sun West Bottlers, LLC, as a subsidiary, and appointed her president and chief operating officer. She oversaw an expansion of the company, buying a local competitor, and had plans to expand even further, out of state. In 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Diversified Lending Group, and its head, Bruce Fred Friedman, with operating a $216 million Ponzi scheme. Placourakis was named as a relief defendant (not accused of wrongdoing), and asked to return $275,000 Friedman had given her. Placourakis said Sun West would not be affected. In 2010, Sun West Bottlers was acquired by NutriPure Beverages, Inc. After Sun West, Tina Machado (returning to her maiden name), worked with Gerald Schwalbach of Spensa Development Group. They co-founded Rarity Investments in 2012, which funds new and emerging technology companies. Then, in 2013, they launched CodeRed-I, a mobile application development studio, with Machado as CEO. Her latest project is Bridge the Gap Strategy, a business consulting company. In 2015, Machado was listed among the most influential women in Arizona business by Arizona Business Magazine.

In 2005, 39% of Colombia's exports went to the United States, and 29% of Colombia's imports were supplied by the United States. The second most significant trading partner for Colombia is Venezuela, accounting for 7% of Colombia's imports and 10% of Colombia's exports. Other significant trading partners for Colombia are Mexico, Ecuador, Germany, and Brazil. Colombia is the 28th largest U.S. export market ($5.41 billion in 2005) and the 31st largest source of U.S. imports ($8.85 billion in 2005). The dominant U.S. import item from Colombia is crude oil (38% of U.S. imports from Colombia in 2005), followed by coal, other petroleum oils, precious and semi- precious stones, coffee, tea, and flowers and plants.Luxner, Larry, Colombia Reaches Crossroads With Free Trade Agreement, The Washington Diplomat, 27 July 2011 Two-thirds of U.S. exports to Colombia are manufactured goods.Hidalgo, Juan C. and Griswold, D., Trade Agreement Would Promote U.S. Exports and Colombian Civil Society, Free Trade Bulletin No. 44, 15 February 2011 The top U.S. exports are chemicals, plastics, electrical equipment, excavating machinery, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer accessories, industrial engines, and drilling and oilfield equipment. For the last seven years, Colombia has been receiving $10 billion to $15 billion annually in foreign direct investment, and has been rapidly developing its mining sector. As a result, Colombia is the sixth-largest market in the world for large earthmoving equipment manufactured by Caterpillar Inc., a U.S. manufacturer of bulldozers and other earthmoving machinery, despite a Colombian tariff of five to fifteen percent.Tarter, Steve, and McDonald, Karen, Schock, Cat CEO praise trade pact with Colombia, The Journal Star, 6 April 2011. U.S. agricultural exports benefiting under the agreement include beef and pork products, wheat, corn, soybeans, and cotton. The agreement would grant immediate duty-free access to export categories most important to the U.S. beef industry, such as USDA Prime and Choice beef cuts. All other tariffs on beef would be eliminated, with the final tariffs removed within 15 years. Colombian tariffs on pork products ranging from 20 to 30 percent, would be phased out to zero within 5 to 15 years. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates the fully implemented agreement would boost U.S. beef exports to Colombia by 46 percent and pork exports by 72 percent. Colombian tariffs of 5 to 20 percent for wheat and soybeans would be immediately eliminated; with a 25 percent tariff on corn to be phased out over 12 years. The agreement would immediately eliminate the 10 percent duty on U.S. cotton upon enactment U.S. imports from Colombia have increased notably since 1996, from $4.27 billion in 1996 to $8.85 billion in 2005, a 107% increase. The U.S. trade deficit with Colombia was $3.43 billion in 2005. Since late 2006, U.S. products have been charged more than $3.4 billion in Colombian tariffs and duties that otherwise would have been eliminated by the free trade agreement.

The Agreement then underwent a constitutionally mandated court review, according to Colombian regulations. The agreement was deemed to conform to the Colombian Constitution by Colombia's Constitutional Court in July 2008. Aspects of the agreement relating to copyright were planned to be implemented in Colombia Bill no. 201 of 2012.El Congreso de Colombia, Proyecto de Ley no. 201 de 2012 (unofficial English translation). Process in the U.S. President Bush sent legislation to implement the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement to Congress for its approval on April 7, 2007. It was not approved before the end of the Congressional session in December 2008 or the end of President Bush's term in January 2009. President Obama asked the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to address outstanding issues in the agreement; however, during a visit from Colombian President Uribe in June 2009, Obama said he did not have a \\"strict timetable\\" to the agreement, as controversy over the safety of Colombian labor leaders continue. U.S. Congress' failure to secure approval of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement has adversely affected bilateral relations between the two nations.Jos√© R. C√°rdenas, How Obama is losing Colombia FP, 25 April 2011 On October 12, 2011 after renegotiating parts of the agreement, it was passed by the House 262‚Äì167 and the Senate 66‚Äì33. An aid program for displaced workers called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was also included in the bill.  Key provisions of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement   Market access  Upon implementation, the agreement would eliminate duties on 80% of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products to Colombia. An additional 7% of U.S. exports would receive duty-free treatment within five years of implementation. Remaining tariffs would be eliminated ten years after implementation. Colombia will join the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Information Technology Agreement (ITA), which would remove Colombia's trade barriers to information technology products. In agriculture, the agreement would grant duty-free treatment immediately to certain farm products from both countries, including high quality beef, cotton, wheat, and soybean meal. Other products that would receive immediate duty-free treatment are key fruits and vegetables, including apples, pears, peaches, and cherries, and many processed food products, including frozen French fries and cookies. Some other products would receive improved market access; these include pork, beef, corn, poultry, rice, fruits and vegetables, processed products, and dairy products. The United States and Colombia worked together to resolve sanitary and phytosanitary barriers to trade in agriculture, including food safety inspection procedures for beef, pork, and poultry. These commitments are reportedly written in two separate side letters on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that would be attached to the FTA. Allegations of human rights violations In the first 10 months of the Santos administration in Colombia, 104 labor and human rights activists were murdered. One category of human rights abuses involves the murder of over 50 labor leaders from the Legal Left at the hands of paramilitaries and death squads, and sometimes there have been allegations of involvement on the part of multinational corporations. In a few cases, this has resulted in damaging public allegations and even court cases for several multinational corporations from the US and Canada (including Dole, Coca-Cola, Drummond Coal, and Chiquita, formerly known as the United Fruit Company). The Colombian Sintraminercol mining union has alleged that many international mining companies already working in Colombia have a record of paramilitary collaboration, as well as environmental negligence. The agreement has had much difficulty passing Congress for years due to the persistence of these issues. The following videos, launched by the US Office on Colombia on June 23, 2011, provide testimony from Colombian citizens on the impact of the FTA on: * Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities *Small-scale workers and farmers *Colombian civil society Political violence had greatly lessened in Colombia over the past decade, however, and objections to the trade agreement have been criticized by Colombians and the Republican party. Conservative Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who signed a Canada - Colombia agreement that took effect in August 2011, has accused opponents of trade deals with the country as \\"standing in the way of the development of the prosperity of Colombia,\\" adding that \\"we can't block the progress of a country like this for protectionist reasons and try to use human rights as a front for doing that.\\"Steven Chase, Stephen Harper defends free-trade deal with Colombia The Globe and Mail August 2011 See also * Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement * √Årea de Libre Comercio de las Am√©ricas (ALCA), English name: Free Trade Area of the Americas * Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act *Rules of Origin *Market access *Free-trade area *Tariffs References External links *Embassy of Colombia * The Colombian Government Trade Bureau * U.S. International Trade Commission Press Release * Congressional Research Service Report on Andean Free Trade Agreement, including Peru TPA * Colombia-United States Free Trade Agreement at Discourse DB *Brief Summary of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement *Fact Sheets Detailed Summary of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement Video talking about the reasons for a FTA with Colombia - Under Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Chris.

It is located on Campus Road, adjacent to the Ho Plaza and Cornell Health. Background The construction of Willard Straight Hall was initiated by Willard Dickerman Straight's widow, Dorothy Payne Whitney, as a memorial to her husband. The building was intended to lead to \\"the enrichment of the human contacts of student life\\", according to the speech Straight gave at the dedication of the hall. Cornell historian Corey Earle notes that in the era Willard Straight Hall was constructed, \\"it was unusual to have a building with no academic purpose\\". The concept of a \\"student union\\" building was a recent invention at the time‚Äîthe first student union in North America, Houston Hall at the University of Pennsylvania, had opened in 1896. When Willard Straight Hall opened its doors in 1925, it was still one of only a few such structures in the country dedicated to student life. However, Cornell provided on-campus space for student organizations since its earliest days. In January 1870, Andrew Dickson White allocated a large room in the middle section of White Hall to be used as a \\"Society Hall.\\" White donated $1,000 to furnish it subject to $300 in matching gifts from student organizations.F.E. Moyer, ‚ÄùCornell Student Activities,‚Äù Cornell Magazine (8:4)(Jan. 1895) at 187‚Äì194 Later, Barnes Hall was built to house the Students‚Äô Christian Association in 1888. Western facade on Libe Slope In 1918, recently widowed, Dorothy Whitney Straight met a Cornell Agriculture student, Leonard Knight Elmhirst, who persuaded her to visit the campus. Elmhirst and Straight together with certain faculty members decided that the best realization of Willard Straight's wish that some of his estate be used to make Cornell a more \\"human place\\" was to build a student union building. Elmhirst graduated from Cornell and left for India in 1921. For the next three years, Dorothy Straight oversaw planning for Willard Straight Memorial Hall, which was to be built with part of her Whitney family fortune in addition to Willard Straight's bequest. The cornerstone was laid on June 15, 1924 and the dedication ceremony was held on November 25, 1925. Elmhirst and Dorothy Straight had been married in April 1925. The North Lobby entrance on the eastern side of the building on Ho Plaza. This entrance was previously limited to use by men.Leonard Elmhirst came from a land-owning family in Yorkshire, England. The seeds for his study of agriculture in Ithaca, NY and subsequent Dartington Hall School and \\"Institute for Rural Reconstruction' in the agriculturally impoverished England of the 1920s were sown on his first visit to India during World War I. Design Willard Straight Memorial Hall was designed by a noted architect of the day, William Adams Delano, and constructed from the local \\"llenroc\\" bluestone, a feldspathic sandstone; the architectural model for its Gothic revival style may have been the 14th- century Dartington Hall in Devon, which the newlyweds purchased in 1925. Murals in the lobby by Ezra Winter date from 1926 and represent Willard Straight's business interests in China and his enthusiasm for the arts. The murals depict virtues as chivalry, adventure, diplomacy, creativity, and optimism. History Opening Willard Straight Hall opened in November 1925, following twenty months of construction at a cost of $1.5 million to construct, and $100,000 to furnish. 4,800 people streamed into the building to see it on opening day, and 3,000 more on the following day. Access to the building was by membership only. All undergraduates were automatically members, but faculty, trustees, and grad students could pay for the privilege at $8 per year, and alumni could join for $5 per year. Access for women Dorothy Straight's preference was for the building to be equally accessible to men and women, but she encountered strong faculty opposition. As a compromise, the larger main entrance would be restricted to men, and women would be permitted to enter via the smaller south entrance; Straight's hope was that women would subsequently have access to the main central area of the building. However, on the building's opening in 1925, women were restricted to the use to two lounges and a rest room near the south entrance. Ten years later, the food service areas were opened to women. During World War II, women were given access to the entire building except the barber shop. It was not until 1977 that the barber shop, and thus the whole building, was finally integrated to both sexes. From Willard Straight Hall's opening, the main desk was staffed by undergraduate students. In addition, the building's policies are set, updated, and enforced by the student-led Willard Straight Hall Board of Governors, more commonly known on campus as the Willard Straight Hall Student Union Board (SUB). Prior to 1969, the upper floors of the Straight served as a hotel for Cornell's visitors and guests. The broadcast studios of the WVBR Radio station were in a lower level. The building also housed the University Theatre, where until 1988 the Cornell Dramatic Club (formed in 1925 from the merger of the Dramatic Club and the Women‚Äôs Dramatic Club) staged almost 50 performances a year. As Cornell built more dormitories on the West Campus and the North Campus, two additional buildings supplemented the Straight to serve students: Noyes Center on West Campus and the North Campus Union (now Robert Purcell Community Center) on North Campus. The combined operation constituted the Department of University Unions. In 1970, with the advent of the University Senate, University Unions became a part of the new Division of Campus Life. In order to end duplication and tensions between the University Unions and the Dean of Students Office, University Unions merged into the latter Department. 1969 building takeover Pulitzer Prize-winning photo Willard Straight Hall and Ho Plaza as seen from McGraw Tower In the 1968‚Äì69 school year, the university judicial system was the center of a controversy in connection with the disciplining of African-American students who had engaged in a protest. It was also directly related to the burning of a cross on the lawn of the Wari House, the dormitory for African-American women on campus. (Ithaca police reportedly suspected, but never proved, that the cross was burned by members of the campus Afro-American Society as a pretext for further protest). As racial tensions escalated, some African-American students demanded amnesty for the accused protesters as well as the establishment of an Africana Studies center. On April 19, 1969, some of them occupied Willard Straight Hall, ejecting parents who were visiting for \\"Parents Weekend\\" from the hotel rooms on the upper floors. Subsequently, white students from Delta Upsilon fraternity unsuccessfully attempted to retake the building by force. Some of the occupying students left the building and returned with firearms in case of a further attack. Then the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) led by C. David Burak formed a protective cordon outside the building. Ultimately, the Cornell Administration, particularly Vice President Steven Muller, negotiated an end to the building takeover. The photos of the students marching out of the Straight carrying rifles and wearing bandoleers made the national news and won a Pulitzer Prize for Associated Press photographer Steve Starr. On campus, the Straight takeover led to the formation of the University Senate, a restructuring of the Board of Trustees, a new campus judicial system, and the foundation of the Africana Studies and Research Center. By the end of the academic year, Cornell President James Perkins resigned. It also led to the creation of the Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center in late 1969, but the building it was housed in was burned down by a racially motivated arson attack less than a year after its creation. Beyond Cornell, the Straight takeover led to the New York State Legislature enacting the Henderson Law, which required each college to adopt \\"Rules of the Maintenance of Public Order.\\"N.Y.S. Education Law ¬ß 6430 Vice President Spiro Agnew referred to the Straight Takeover in speeches as an example of the excess of college students. Thomas Sowell would later refer to the takeover as the result of policies intended to \\"increase minority student enrollment... by admitting students who would not meet the existing academic standards at Cornell.\\" In Sowell's opinion, some of the militants accepted \\"turned out to be hoodlums who terrorized other black students\\".Thomas Sowell, \\"The Day Cornell Died,\\" Hoover Digest 1999 no. 4, November 30, 1999. 2017 protest In a move reminiscent of the 1969 takeover, 300 marchers again occupied Willard Straight Hall for a few hours after presenting a list of demands to president Martha Pollack. The protest, led by Black Students United, was a response in part to the assault of a black Cornell student a few days earlier. Facilities Willard Straight Hall has always served as an space for socializing and informal connection between students. Over the years the building has evolved and changed significantly. At various times the building has featured an information desk, a Game Room with billiards and ping pong, a Browsing Library, a tea room (for women), a barber shop, movie theater, dining halls, an Art Room, a Music Room, a lost-and-found, a newsstand, a live performance theatre with orchestra pit and rotating stage, a ceramics studio, an ice cream shop, television lounges, spaces for meetings and coffeehouses, and offices for student organizations. The Ivy Room was originally built as a mess hall for servicemen during World War II. The building once held guest rooms on the fifth floor for alumni and visitors. A photographic darkroom opened in 1939, was expanded in 1973, and closed its doors in 2006. Celebrations were held to observe the building's 25th anniversary in 1950, and its 75th anniversary in 2000. Current facilities Inside the Memorial Room, used for administrative meetings, dances, fashion shows, craft fairs, and weddings The building currently encloses several dining facilities (Okenshields, The Ivy Room, and The Bears Den), and lounge spaces for students. A lounge on the south end of the building is named in honor of Leonard Elmhirst. Special facilities include: Several multi-purpose rooms used for dance and performance troupes, Cornell Cinema (in the Straight Theater), a full service digital computer lab, newly remodeled 2nd floor Elizabeth Staley Office of Student Support and Diversity Education, 5th floor Student Activities Office, Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, offices and mailboxes for student organizations, the 4th Floor WSH Art Gallery, and the Browsing Library, International Lounge, and Music Room. It formerly housed the Cornell Ceramics Studio, which closed in May 2011. A long-running joke among students concerns the placement of a power outlet on the ceiling of the staircase leading down to the Ivy Room. The offices of Cornell Cinema and the Dean of Students Office are also in the building. During the Fall 2020 Semester, a COVID-19 surveillance testing facility opened on the 4th floor of the building. Limitations Due to its age, the Straight has many outdated facilities, such as poor heating, ventilation, and acoustics. Amenities such as teleconferencing and modern air conditioning are restricted by the ancient electrical system, and the building is not adequately wheelchair accessible.

The formation of the Party  Its support was concentrated in the Western Division, mainly in the provinces of Nadroga and Ba. Its formation was due to disenchantment of western Fijians about not receiving fair return from the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) from the income derived from their land. Fiji's foreign exchange earnings are mainly generated from sugar, tourism, pine and gold, produced in the western division. It was claimed that western landowners, despite providing 65% of the money that financed the NLTB, received only 9%. The Party was launched on 17 July 1981 with the following goals: * Protect and encourage the unity of western Fijians * Protect the interests of landowners and to defend their rights to develop their resources according to their aspirations. * Seek changes in the Ministry of Fijian Affairs and Rural Development to improve the lives of western Fijians. * Improve educational facilities of western Fijians and provide them opportunities in commercial and industrial enterprises.  Coalition with NFP  As the WUF had a narrow base and a regional focus it formed a coalition with NFP on 11 January 1982, because it regarded the NFP as \\"the most prominent political party opposed to the Alliance\\". Each party was to maintain its independent identity and objectives. Jai Ram Reddy, the leader of the NFP regarded the coalition as a partnership of equals.  Leadership of WUF  The leader of the party was Osea Gavidi, a Nadroga chief, who had had a long-standing dispute with NLTB regarding pine plantations in Nadroga. He had contested the parliamentary election of March 1977 and September 1977 as an independent candidate, narrowly winning the Nadroga Fijian Communal Constituency. A prominent member was Napolioni Dawai, a Nadi chief, who had been an assistant Minister in the Alliance Government, but had lost pre-selection for his seat. He had been involved in disputes with tourist resort operators in Nadi regarding appropriate compensation for the use of his tribal land. Another prominent member was Isikeli Nadalo, who had formed the Nadroga Fijian Cane Growers Association and later the Fijian National Party to contest the 1963 election. He had then merged his party with Apisai Tora's Western Democratic Party to form the National Democratic Party, which in turn had merged with the Federation party to form the National Federation Party (NFP). Isikeli Nadalo was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972 under the NFP ticket but left the party following its split in 1977.  1982 Election  In the 1982 election, the WUF contested all the Fijian Communal Seats in the Western Division plus some others in adjoining provinces. Osea Gavidi narrowly lost the Nadroga Fijian seat, with 47.9% of the votes. Isikeli Nadalo won the National seat based in the Nadroga Province, while Napolioni Dawai lost his Ba-Nadi Fijian Communal seat obtaining only 22.8% of the votes. All other WUF candidates did poorly, getting less than 10% of the votes. Although WUF delivered 7% of the ethnic Fijian vote to the NFP-WUF coalition it was not enough to win enough seats to form Government. The coalition ended with the election and the leader of NFP blamed the failure of WUF to win enough Fijian votes for the coalition's loss.  1987 Election  On 6 June 1986, the first meeting regarding a coalition with the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) took place with Western United Front delegates where MP, Isikeli Nadalo argued that, \\"there should only be two political groups fighting the election.\\" With the common aim of defeating the Alliance, on 10 October 1986, agreement was reached for coalition with FLP. In November 1986, when only Osea Gavidi was endorsed as a candidate by the coalition, which now also included the National Federation Party (NFP), WUF withdrew from the coalition. WUF fought the 1987 election in partnership with an NFP splinter group led by Sharda Nand, a supporter of Sidiq Koya. In the elections, WUF lost ground to both the Alliance and the Labour Party, with Gavidi receiving 41.7 percent of the vote and Nadalo only 13 percent.  References  * R.

He is now considered the 'Poet of Yemen'.  Life and works  Shabazi was born in 1619 in the town of Najd Al-Walid. His family's pedigree has been traced back to Zera·∏•, the son of Judah, the son of Jacob who is called Israel.Avraham al- Nadaf, Hoveret (Composition), Jerusalem 1928 , p. 1; reprinted in Zekhor Le'Avraham, Jerusalem 1992, p. 1 of Part II (Hebrew); includes the author's note, where he adds concerning Shabazi's lineage: \\"Thus did R. Yefeth b. Sa ªadia Shar ªabi tell me, may G-d keep him, who saw the said genealogy in a certain book belonging to our Rabbi Sholem in his house of study in the town of Ta ªiz.\\" At the death of his father, Yosef Mashta, Shalom moved to the small town of Shabbaz, near the city of Ta'izz. Not long thereafter, he again moved and settled in Ta'izz where he built a house of prayer and a ritual bath (mikveh) outside of the city, beneath Jebel ·π¢abir.Avraham al-Nadaf, History of Rabbi Shalom ben Yosef al-Shabazi, of Blessed Memory (pub. in Zekhor Le'Avraham), Jerusalem 1992, p. 3 of Part II It was from here that he and his family were expelled, along with most of the Yemenite Jews in 1679. He died in ca. 1720. His father, Yosef ben Abijad ben Khalfun, was also a Rabbi and a poet. Shabazi's extant poetic diwan, comprising some 550 poems, was published for the first time by the Ben-Zvi Institute in 1977. He wrote in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Judeo-Arabic. Shabazi's other works include a treatise on astrology and a kabbalistic commentary on the Torah. Shabazi's grave in Ta'izz is revered by Jews and Muslims alike. He wrote a commentary on the Torah called Hemdath Yamim (Pleasant Days). His leadership was instrumental in helping the Jews of Yemen survive some of the worst persecution in its history. Mori (Yemenites often call their spiritual leaders \\"Mori\\" meaning \\"my master\\" or \\"my teacher\\"). Shabazi wrote a kinah (lamentation) for recitation during the Ninth of Av, recalling the terrible exile of Jews in his lifetime (known as the Exile of Mawza) from all cities and towns in Yemen to an inhospitable desert called Mawza, duringtime the Jews were banished there of which 20% perished. The Diwan of Mori Shabazi alludes not only to that dreadful event in 1679 but also to the Decree of the Headgear in 1667.Yosef Tobi, Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazi. In the poem, Be- hatkaz gazeru  ªal ha- ªa·π≠arot, Shabazi writes: \\"In the year 5467 (of the Creation=1667 CE), the sons of the handmaid made a decree over the headgear (Heb.  ªA·π≠arot), so as to humiliate my elders.\\" Shabazi's Diwan has become an essential part of Yemenite Jewry's spiritual and cultural lives. According to Professor emeritus, Yosef Tobi, \\"the fundamental revolutionary change in the poetry of Yemen occurred with the work of Yosef ben Yisrael (17th century), when poetry became the primary tool for spiritual expression of Yemenite Jewry, and when the subject of exile and redemption took on vitality and had the most concrete political significance. Even more so, we find this change in the poetry of his younger relative, Shalom Shabazƒ´.\\"Yosef Tobi, Politics and Poetry in the Works of Shalom Shabazi, Department of Hebrew & Comparative Literature, University of Haifa (Israel); Published online by Routledge, 14 Apr 2014, p. 5 In Shabazi's Diwan there can be found many long eschatological poems, numbered at several dozen, and which open with the words, Baraq burayq, or with compounds that are similar to them, said to be a sign of some supernatural occurrence, as one of the signs heralding the coming of the Messiah. The founder of these genres of poetic visions of redemption is Yosef ben Yisrael in whose footsteps followed many poets, including Shabazƒ´ who is said to have refined it. An example of Shabazi's sublime poetic style is seen in the following lyric although the rhyme has been lost in the translation: Mori Shalom Shabazi is said to have written nearly 15,000 liturgical poems on nearly all topics in Judaism, of which only about 850 have survived the ravages of persecution, time and the lack of printing presses in Yemen. He wrote his Diwan (Anthology of liturgical poetry) in Judeo-Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic. When rumors reached Yemen concerning Shabbetai Zevi in 1666, many of the Jews of Yemen were drawn after him, including Shabazƒ´ himself, even though the rabbinic court at ·π¢an ªƒÅ‚Äô had completely rejected the faith in this pseudo- Messiah. In Shabazi's poem, Adon ha-kol me·∏•ayye kol neshama, he alludes to Shabbetai Zevi in these words: \\"We have heard singing from the end of the earth: / A righteous gazelle has appeared in the East and West.\\" The ‚Äúrighteous gazelle‚Äù (in original Hebrew: zevi ·π£addƒ´q) is an allusion to Shabbetai Zevi. Mori Shalom Shabazi is also said to have composed several poems concerning the Exile of Mawza (Galut Mawza), which he witnessed in his day. Currently, the Israeli government and the Chief Rabbinate are trying to bring the remains of Rabbi Shabazi to Israel. Many of his poems have elaborate detailed premonitions of returning to Israel, with his people. In popular culture Shabazi's poem \\"Im Nin'alu\\" (◊ê◊ù ◊†◊†◊¢◊ú◊ï) became a hit single sung by Israeli singer Ofra Haza whose family is of Yemenite origin, and it has also been interpreted by Yemenite singer Daklon. Other songs, such as \\"As'alak\\" (ÿ£ÿ≥ÿ£ŸÑŸÉ), were also performed by Ofra Haza as well as Zion Golan, Aharon Amram and Shoshana Damari. Another famous poem, \\"Ahavat Ra'aya Retzoni\\", was performed by Zohar Argov. The Israeli metal band, Orphaned Land, sang one of his poems in ita song \\"Olat Ha'tamid\\". There is also a small street named after him in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem. {class=\\"toccolours\\" |+ The SONGS of SHABAZI -- A collection of abstracts ◊ñ◊ï◊î◊® ◊§◊†◊ô ◊®◊¢◊ô◊î. ◊ú◊ë◊ô ◊ë◊°◊ï◊ì ◊î◊ó◊ô◊î. ◊ô◊ï◊ù ◊î◊†◊ì◊ï÷π◊ì ◊ê◊ï◊ñ◊ú ◊ó◊û◊ì ◊ß◊®◊ô◊î. ◊ê◊ï◊î◊ú ◊ú◊™◊ï◊©◊ô◊î. ◊†◊ë◊ó◊® ◊ú◊ì◊ï÷π◊ì ◊ï◊ê◊†◊ô ◊ë◊™◊ï◊ö ◊©◊ë◊ô◊î. ◊ó◊©◊ß◊ô ◊®÷∞◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ ◊¶◊ë◊ô◊î. ◊ú◊î ◊ê◊ó◊û◊ï÷π◊ì ‚ÄúThe face of my companion shines, My heart by [her] secret was enlivened, On [this sullen] day of wandering.

Rockefeller III National Tournament of Elementary State Champions. The tournament is named for the founder, Arnold Denker and is usually referred to as \\"The Denker\\". History The Denker Tournament of High School Champions was started by Arnold Denker in 1984. Qualifying This chess tournament is by invitation only. Each United States Chess Federation sanctioned state affiliate, including Northern California, Southern California, and Washington, D.C., is allowed to send one player. If there is an odd number of players, the host state is allowed to send a second player to compete and win prizes. Each state affiliate can use any method they wish to choose their representative. Many state affiliates have chosen to hold one tournament, usually their state championship tournament, as the qualifier. The highest finishing high school player from the high school championship division, is then chosen as the state representative. If no player is chosen, or for some reason cannot attend, the United States Chess Federation will instead contact the second-place finisher or designated alternate to determine if they wish to attend. Prizes The tournament has multiple sponsors. The US Chess Trust provides scholarship money for the top players; based upon final rank. Mitchell Denker, son of Arnold Denker, provided funding for many of the prizes. Players who are under the age of 16 are also eligible to win another scholarship. The Ursula Foster Scholarship provides $500 to the best finish by a competitor under 16. If there are no players under 16, it goes to the best finish by a player under 17.

Some of the modules built for Mir-2 have been incorporated into the International Space Station (ISS). The project underwent many changes, but was always based on the DOS-8 base block space station core module, built as a back-up to the DOS-7 base block used in the Mir station. The DOS-8 base block was eventually used as the Zvezda module of the ISS. Its design lineage extends back to the original Salyut stations. Project history The evolution of the Mir-2 project 1981 to 1987: KB Salyut Mir-2 The prototype of the central module was as Polyus. Mir-2 would be capable of docking at least four modules in ordinary operation. December 14, 1987: NPO Energia Mir-2 Designated as OSETS (Orbital Assembly and Operations Centre). The station would be built in a 65 degree orbit and consist of 90 ton modules. *Launch 1 - DOS 8, providing housing for the assembly crew. *Launch 2 - 90 ton module. *Launch 3 - Truss and solar arrays. *Launches 4 to 6 - additional 90 ton modules. 1991: \\"Mir-1.5\\" This would involve launch of the DOS-8, after which the Buran shuttle would grapple the module, rendezvous with Mir, and attach it to the old DOS-7 base block. This plan was later altered so that DOS-8 would maneuver and dock itself to Mir. It would remain attached for two years. 1992: \\"Mir-2\\" The station would consist of the DOS-8 core module and a cross beam called the NEP (Science Power Platform). This was equipped with MSB retractable solar panels, Sfora thruster packages and small scientific packages. Four 3 to 4 ton modules were planned: *Docking Module - with the APDS universal androgynous docking system, and a side hatch for space walks *Resource Module - Equipped with gyrodynes for orienting the station and a passive docking port for docking of Soyuz or Progress ferry spacecraft *Technology Module - with materials experiments *Biotechnology Module November 1993: International Space Station built around Mir-2 The Russian Orbital Segment Russian elements of the International Space Station include: *Zarya FGB, the first element launched. This was a US-funded TKS- derived propulsion module built by KB Salyut. *Zvezda Service Module - this is the DOS-8 station, which was launched as the third major ISS module in July 2000. *SO-1 (Pirs) - one of the docking modules originally designed for Buran/Mir-2 was added to the station in September 2001. *SO-2 Poisk - A module similar to Pirs. Poisk also provides extra space for scientific experiments, and power-supply outlets and data-transmission interfaces for external scientific payloads. *Rassvet - the only module delivered by NASA shuttle, in a barter exchange for the launch 'owed' for Zarya. Rassvet is used for cargo storage, science, and as a docking port for visiting spacecraft.

Early life McKay was born at the Hudson's Bay Company's Edmonton House, the son of James Charles (b. 1797 Scotland) and Marguerite Gladu (Metis b. 1809, Cumberland House). He was a fur-trader and guide/interpreter with the HBC and later became a political figure in the Red River Colony. McKay was educated at Red River and began work with the HBC in 1853. It is a testament to his skills that many distinguished visitors sought him out as a guide. He often met the HBC governor, George Simpson in Crow Wing, Minnesota and escorted him to Upper Fort Garry. In 1857, while at Fort Ellice, he was engaged to guide the John Palliser party from Fort Ellice (St Lazare, Man.) through the Saskatchewan plains to its winter quarters at Fort Carlton (Sask.). McKay married in 1859 and left the HBC in 1860, going into business for himself. He established his home west of the Forks in present-day Manitoba and quickly became involved in this community. He was made a member of the Council of Assiniboia in 1868, and caught up in the hostilities in the Red River Colony during 1869‚Äì70. Because of his M√©tis heritage, he chose to leave the community for a short time. On his return, he was made a member of the provisional government. He was a brother to Angus McKay who was active in the political unrest of the time. Northwest Territories Council McKay was appointed as a member of the Temporary North-West Council along with Pierre Delorme and Joseph Royal in 1873. These appointments were made in response to demand by M√©tis who wanted representation in the government. While he was on the council he worked on dealing with problems affecting the native population. His skills, both as a negotiator and interpreter, made his input instrumental in a number of Treaty negotiations.  Indian Treaty negotiations  James McKay made important contributions in the settlement of Indian land claims. He was part of the negotiation of Treaty 1 (Lower Fort Garry) and Treaty 2 (Manitoba Post on Lake Manitoba) in 1871. He continued with Treaty 3 (North West Angle of Lake of the Woods) in 1873. In 1875, he was a commissioner for Treaty 5, which was negotiated at Winnipeg. He also was Indian commissioner for Treaty 6 which was signed at Fort Carlton and Fort Pitt in 1876.  Province of Manitoba  After Manitoba became a province, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Manitoba, serving as its speaker until 1874. After the council was abolished in 1876, he was elected by acclamation to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the district of Lake Manitoba. McKay served as Minister of Agriculture from 1875 to 1878, when he resigned due to poor health. He was considered to have excellent judgment; but influenced strongly by the views of the Archbishop Alexandre-Antonin Tach√©.

Career Postyshev was born in Ivanovo-Voznesensk in Vladimir Governorate in to the family of a weaver. He was a member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party from 1904, then a member of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) in Siberia. In 1923 he was reassigned from his position in the Far Eastern Republic to supervise organization of the Communist Party committee in Kyiv Governorate (guberniya) in central Ukraine. In 1925 Postyshev became secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, or CP(b)U. In 1926‚Äì30 he became a member of the Politburo and Organizational Bureau of Ukraine's Bolshevik Party. As secretary of the Kharkiv Oblast and city Party committees, Postyshev organized the purge of Trotskyists and Ukrainian national-communists as well as industrialization and collectivization campaigns in the region. In July 1930 he was promoted to the office of secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolshevik) in Moscow and put in charge of propaganda and organization. Postyshev speaks at House of the Unions Sep 05 1931 In January 1933 Postyshev was once again sent to Ukraine as Stalin's personal representative, along with thousands of political appointees from Russia. Upon Postyshev's arrival in Ukraine he was elected second secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine and first secretary of the Kharkiv city and Kharkiv Oblast Party organizations. From July 1934 to January 1937 he was in charge of the Kyiv Oblast Party organization. As second secretary he was nominally subordinate to First Secretary Stanislav Kosior, but his appointment by Stalin effectively gave him supreme power. Postyshev's mission in Ukraine was to eliminate any remaining opposition to Stalin by purging all traces of \\"nationalist deviation\\" from the Party, to end the cultural policy of Ukrainization, and to bring collectivization to completion at any cost.Paul Robert Magocsi (1996), p 567, Subtelny (1998), p 418. A prominent scapegoat was Mykola Skrypnyk, the director of Ukrainization, who was removed from his post within a month (he later shot himself rather than face a show trial).Magocsi (1996), p 567, Subtelny (1998), p 419. The end of Ukrainization was accompanied by an attack on cultural institutions in Ukraine and the new Soviet intelligentsia. Under Postyshev, thousands of authors, scholars, philosophers, artists, musicians and editors were exiled to labour camps, executed or simply disappeared. Many others avoided being denounced by working according to Moscow dictates. \\"Nests of nationalist counter-revolutionaries\\" like the commissariats of education, agriculture, and justice, newspapers, journals, encyclopedias and film studios were purged.Subtelny (1988), p 419. Over 15,000 officials were eliminated on charges of \\"nationalism.\\" The Ukrainian Communist Party was also targeted. In a prelude to the Great Purge, almost 100,000 members were expelled during Postyshev's first year in Ukraine, and a further 168,000 through 1938.Magocsi (1996), p 567‚Äì68, Subtelny (1988), p 419. Postyshev wrote in his report that the majority were exiled or shot. The highest ranking were paraded through elaborate show trials. As the purges progressed after 1933, affecting millions throughout the Soviet Union, Postyshev's crackdown spread beyond perceived \\"Ukrainianizers,\\" \\"nationalists,\\" and opponents of collectivization. Eventually it came to include the liquidation of entire classes such as kulaks, priests, people who had been members of anti-Bolshevik armies, and even ethnic Ukrainians who had travelled abroad or immigrated from Galicia.Magocsi (1996), p 567, Subtelny (1988), p 420‚Äì21.Kaganovich, Stalin, Postyshev, Voroshilov. Postyshev criticized the Ukrainian Communists for their \\"lack of Bolshevik vigilance\\" in Stalin's systematic enforcement of increased grain quotas. His party activists conducted a brutal campaign through farms and homes, searching for suspected hiding places and confiscating every bit of grain, with disregard for the starvation they encountered. Millions died in the famine of 1932‚Äì33.Subtelny (1988), p 414. Lev Mekhlis letter to Zhdanov: \\"Postyshev searches enemies not where they really are\\" After the famine, Postyshev was removed from Ukraine and appointed first secretary of the Kuibyshev Oblast Party Committee.Subtelny (1998), p 420. There during the Great Purge, he launched an extensive hunt for \\"enemies of the people\\". He was noteworthy for promoting the practice of the New Year tree after publishing a famous letter in Pravda on 28 December 1935, in which he asked for trees to be installed in schools, children's homes, Young Pioneer Palaces, children's clubs, children's theaters and cinemas. Downfall Despite being a fanatical fighter against Trotskyists through his career, soon he was accused of being Trotskyist himself and was arrested on February 26, 1938.. Postyshev story on 25:00. His arrest came after he was denounced by Lev Mekhlis who feared that Postyshev's repression might affect him. He was shot at Kuibyshev on February 26, 1939.Magocsi (1996), p 570. Nikita Khrushchev, along with Vyacheslav Molotov and Nikolai Yezhov, were sent to take over Postyshev's post in Ukraine. Khrushchev had to be appointed by Moscow; he could not be elected because, after Postyshev's removal, the entire Central Committee of the CP(b)U \\"had been purged spotless,\\" according to Khrushchev.Magocsi (1996), p. 570, Subtelny (1998), p 420. His wife and son were later executed, after Molotov added his wife's name to a death list. Legacy A railway station which eventually became the city of Pokrovsk was briefly (1934-1938) named Postyshevo after him. Postyshev is known for reviving the New Year tree tradition in the Soviet Union. A letter from Postyshev published in Pravda on December 28, 1935 calls for the installation of New Year trees in schools, children's homes, Young Pioneer Palaces, children's clubs, children's theaters and cinemas.Karen Petrone, Life Has Become More Joyous, Comrades: Celebrations in the Time of Stalin, Indiana University Press, 2000, , Google Print, p.85 Postyshev was rehabilitated in 1956 by Nikita Khrushchev. In January 2010, a Ukrainian Court of Appeal accused Postyshev, Josef Stalin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Stanislav Kosior and other Soviet officials of organizing a man-made famine in Ukraine in 1932‚Äì33 (known as Holodomor) but quashed criminal proceedings against them due to their deaths.Kyiv court accuses Stalin leadership of organizing famine, Kyiv Post (January 13, 2010)  References  *Magocsi, Paul Robert (1996).

Nuclear criticality safety is concerned with mitigating the consequences of a nuclear criticality accident. A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation. Nuclear criticality safety practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, job instructions and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes that could lead to a nuclear criticality accident. Principles The hollow ring shape of this plutonium ingot favors neutron leakage and thus reduces the likelihood of criticality. As a simplistic analysis, a system will be exactly critical if the rate of neutron production from fission is exactly balanced by the rate at which neutrons are either absorbed or lost from the system due to leakage. Safely subcritical systems can be designed by ensuring that the potential combined rate of absorption and leakage always exceeds the potential rate of neutron production. The parameters affecting the criticality of the system may be remembered using the mnemonic MAGICMERV. Some these parameters are not independent from one another, for example, changing mass will result in a change of volume among others. Mass: The probability of fission increases as the total number of fissile nuclei increases. The relationship is not linear. If a fissile body has a given size and shape but varying density and mass, there is a threshold below which criticality can not occur. This threshold is called the critical mass. Absorption: Absorption removes neutrons from the system. Large amounts of absorbers are used to control or reduce the probability of a criticality. Good absorbers are boron, cadmium, gadolinium, silver, and indium. Geometry/shape: The shape of the fissile system affects how easily neutrons can escape (leak out) from it, in which case they are not available to cause fission events in the fissile material. Therefore, the shape of the fissile material affects the probability of occurrence of fission events. A shape with a large surface area, such as a thin slab, favors leakage and is safer than the same amount of fissile material in a small, compact shape such as a cube or sphere. Interaction of units: Neutrons leaking from one unit can enter another. Two units, which by themselves are sub-critical, could interact with each other to form a critical system. The distance separating the units and any material between them influences the effect. Concentration/Density: Neutron reactions leading to scattering, capture or fission reactions are more likely to occur in dense materials; conversely neutrons are more likely to escape (leak) from low density materials. Moderation: Neutrons resulting from fission are typically fast (high energy). These fast neutrons do not cause fission as readily as slower (less energetic) ones. Neutrons are slowed down (moderated) by collision with atomic nuclei. The most effective moderating nuclei are hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon. Hence hydrogenous materials including oil, polyethylene, water, wood, paraffin, and the human body are good moderators. Note that moderation comes from collisions; therefore most moderators are also good reflectors. Enrichment: The probability of a neutron reacting with a fissile nucleus is influenced by the relative numbers of fissile and non-fissile nuclei in a system. The process of increasing the relative number of fissile nuclei in a system is called enrichment. Typically, low enrichment means less likelihood of a criticality and high enrichment means a greater likelihood. Reflection: When neutrons collide with other atomic particles (primarily nuclei) and are not absorbed, they are scattered (i.e. they change direction). If the change in direction is large enough, neutrons that have just escaped from a fissile body may be deflected back into it, increasing the likelihood of fission. This is called ‚Äòreflection‚Äô. Good reflectors include hydrogen, beryllium, carbon, lead, uranium, water, polyethylene, concrete, Tungsten carbide and steel. Volume: For a body of fissile material in any given shape, increasing the size of the body increases the average distance that neutrons must travel before they can reach the surface and escape. Hence, increasing the size of the body increases the likelihood of fission and decreases the likelihood of leakage. Hence, for any given shape (and reflection conditions - see below) there will be a size that gives an exact balance between the rate of neutron production and the combined rate of absorption and leakage. This is the critical size. Other parameters include: Temperature: This particular parameter is less common for the criticality safety practitioner, as in a typical operating environment, where the variation in temperature is minimal, or where the increase in temperature does not adversely affect the criticality of the system, often, it is assumed that room temperate is bounding of the actual temperature of the system being analyzed. This is however only an assumption, it is important for the criticality safety practitioner to understand where this not apply, such as high temperature reactors, or low temperature cryogenic experiments. Heterogeneity: Blending fissile powders into solution, milling of powders or scraps, or other processes that effects the small-scale structure of fissile materials is important. While normally referred to as heterogeneity control, generally the concern is maintaining homogeneity because the homogeneous case is usually less reactive. Particularly, at lower enrichment a system may be more reactive in a heterogeneous configuration compared to a homogeneous configuration. Physicochemical Form: Consists of controlling the physical state (i.e., solid, liquid, or gas) and form (e.g., solution, powder, green or sintered pellets, or metal) and/or chemical composition (e.g., uranium hexafluoride, uranyl fluoride, plutonium nitrate, or mixed oxide) of a particular fissile material. The physicochemical form could indirectly affect other parameters, such as density, moderation, and neutron absorption. Calculations and analyses To determine if any given system containing fissile material is safe, its neutron balance must be calculated. In all but very simple cases, this usually requires the use of computer programs to model the system geometry and its material properties. The analyst describes the geometry of the system and the materials, usually with conservative or pessimistic assumptions. The density and size of any neutron absorbers is minimised while the amount of fissile material is maximised. As some moderators are also absorbers, the analyst must be careful when modelling these to be pessimistic. Computer codes allow analysts to describe a three- dimensional system with boundary conditions. These boundary conditions can represent real boundaries such as concrete walls or the surface of a pond, or can be used to represent an artificial infinite system using a periodic boundary condition. These are useful when representing a large system consisting of many repeated units. Computer codes used for criticality safety analyses include COG (US),COG(US) MONK (UK),MONK(UK) SCALE/KENO (US), MCNP (US),MCNP(US) and CRISTAL (France).CRISTAL (France) Burnup credit Traditional criticality analyses assume that the fissile material is in its most reactive condition, which is usually at maximum enrichment, with no irradiation. For spent nuclear fuel storage and transport, burnup credit may be used to allow fuel to be more closely packed, reducing space and allowing more fuel to be handled safely. In order to implement burnup credit, fuel is modeled as irradiated using pessimistic conditions which produce an isotopic composition representative of all irradiated fuel. Fuel irradiation produces actinides consisting of both neutron absorbers and fissionable isotopes as well as fission products which absorb neutrons. In fuel storage pools using burnup credit, separate regions are designed for storage of fresh and irradiated fuel. In order to store fuel in the irradiated fuel store it must satisfy a loading curve which is dependent on initial enrichment and irradiation.

The ship, along with her three sister ships, was ordered from Britain in 1905 and was built in the Yarrow shipyard at Cubitt Town, London. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and, due to Greece's neutrality the four Thyella class ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916, taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy 1917-18. By 1918, they were back on escort duty under Greek colors, mainly in the Aegean Sea. Sfendoni saw action in the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). After the declaration of war by Italy in World War II, Sfendoni saw action in the area of North Ionian Sea and the strait of Otranto, executing escort missions for cargo ships carrying ammunition, fuel and food to Allied forces. In between escort missions, attack operations of limited scale were planned and executed without any losses to the Hellenic Navy. After the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, the Royal Hellenic Navy suffered serious losses, but Sfendoni evacuated with the remaining ships of the Greek fleet to Alexandria, Egypt and served under British command for the duration of the war. After the war, Sfendoni was decommissioned.

It is a Christian school, founded in 1815, under the auspices of the Bombay Education Society. It has close to 3800 students, all of whom are night scholars. The school is twinned with Barnes School, in Deolali, Nashik. Both schools follow the ICSE curriculum. It is located in Byculla, just ahead of the JJ flyover. The school is located on Clare Road, or as it is locally called, Mirza Ghalib Marg.  History  In the early 1700s, the Rev. Richard Cobbe was appointed chaplain to the British East India Company's Factory in Bombay. In 1718, he founded a small school where twelve poor boys were given free housing, clothing, food, and education. The school, which had one teacher, was located in a building not far from the present-day Cathedral of St. Thomas in Fort, Mumbai. After nearly a century, the Ven. Archdeacon George Barnes, also with the East India Company, realised that the original school could not possibly meet the needs of hundreds of children it then looked after. He appealed for funds, and started the Bombay Education Society in 1815. The original school was taken over by the BES, and numbers grew rapidly until it was apparent that new grounds and school buildings were essential. A large site at Byculla was given by the Government for the building of the school, and the new school buildings were opened in 1825. One of the copper plates commemorating the opening is on the wall of Evan's Hall in Barnes School, while the other remains with Christ Church School. The parish church Christ Church, Byculla was later built on part of the land given originally to the BES, and remains there to this day. Much of the original land was later sold to help in the building of Barnes, which was established in 1925 as a school for boarders. The BES schools, as they were popularly known, were primarily boarding schools for Anglo-Indian boys and girls, mainly belonging to the Anglican Church. However, day-scholars were later admitted, and they were of all castes and creeds. In the early 1900s, the BES merged with the Indo British institution which had been founded by Rev. George Candy, in 1837. In 1925, two new schools were established - one for day-students only (Christ Church School), and one for boarders and day-students (Barnes School). Campus and facilities The school is spread across a large campus. The main building is a long, three-storey structure which houses the 1st to 10th grade classes, the ISC classes, the IGCSE classrooms as well as the science laboratories, teacher's rooms and administration offices. At the other end of the school stands a fourteen-storey building which houses the kindergarten classes, and staff quarters, along with the woodwork room. This building also houses the music room. In between the two buildings lie a hall (used for morning assembly and school functions), a tennis lawn, a basketball court, and a children's playground. The school has a sports field, which is used for its sports activities, as well as for athletics.  School features  The school follows the ICSE course syllabus, as set out by the ICSE board in Delhi. It runs classes from kindergarten to the 10th grade, with each grade being divided into four divisions (A to D). The average class consists of 25 students in kindergarten, and increases to an average of 45 students per class in the 10th grade. The students are divided among four houses, and compete through the year in extracurricular activities: * Barnes (red) * Heber (green) * Malcolm (blue) * Willoughby (yellow) Students called Prefects are appointed by the school to perform duties like monitoring classes when there is no teacher in the class or being involved in flag hoisting during Independence Day. They wear a coloured tie of their house. The main prefects are the head boy and the head girl. There are also house captains for each house, who are the secondary head of each house. The primary head of each house are the 'house presidents', who are one of the teachers. From 2008, Christ Church has introduced a junior college. This college is one of the few ISC colleges in Mumbai, with courses in arts, science and commerce. The college is up till Std. 12.  Uniform  Kindergarten students wear Persian coloured checked shorts, and a Persian blue shirt attached to the shorts, while girls wear Persian blue dress. Boys, up to the 7th grade, wear white shorts, white half- sleeved shirts, school belt, black shoes, and the school tie (which is dark bottle green with a thin yellow stripes running diagonally). The students usually pin a badge of their house name (and the house colour on the background) to their tie or their pockets. From the 8th grade onwards, boys wear full white trousers, a white half- sleeved shirt, the green and yellow striped school belt with school logo in the middle, black shoes, and the school tie. Girls wear a belted all-white dress, with the same tie as boys (for all grades). The college boys wear a deep green full pant and a shirt which has a yellow coloured logo of the school on the pocket. The tie stripes are of a little lighter colour than that of the other students. The college girls wear a deep green skirt and a bow tie of the same colour. On days when students have Physical Education (PE) training, the boys wear a white collared T-shirt, with the collar and sleeves being in the colour of their House. Girls wear a similar T-shirt, with a house-coloured skirt, with house-coloured shorts underneath. Both girls and boys wear white canvas shoes and socks (with two circular bands on the socks representing their house colour) on these days.  Faculty  There is a 16:1 student to teacher ratio. Some of the faculty live on campus, in apartments located in a building which also house the kindergarten school classes. The apartment is located at one end of the school field. Each teacher is affiliated to a house, and each house has a House President for the girls and boys respectively. As part of their House duties, teachers oversee the selection and training of students for participation in inter-house activities. Most of the training is done by the Captain and vice captain of the house.  Heads of Staff  * Principal : Mr. F. Bunyan * Vice-Principal: Mr. Graham Heiden. * Junior school Headmistress : Mrs. W.

He falls into the category of the zanni. His name is a double diminutive of the name Giacomo (Jacob or James). In English, he might be called Jimmy or Jackie. The character dates back to at least the 16th century. He was typically from the southern part of Italy, and could apparently dance and play the mandolin quite well. His mask usually portrays him with a ridiculously long beak-like nose, often near as long as his whole face. His nose and cheeks are usually painted red. He sometimes wears glasses, and is frequently shown with plumes in his hat. Callot shows him dancing with a slapstick and a sword on his belt. Niccolo Barbieri says that Coviello entertains the audience by his \\"grimaces and affected language.\\" Salvator Rosa says that Coviello is \\"sly, adroit, supple, and conceited.\\" In Moli√®re's \\"The Bourgeois Gentleman\\" he disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. He could apparently be stupid or clever as the actor and scenario saw fit to portray him. Likewise his costume could vary. He sometimes wears a skintight unitard, other times he is shown clothed in pants and a doublet. The nose and plumed hat seem to be his most consistent features.

This arboreal ant nests in dead wood and crevices in tree barks. The species name is after the type locality, Bangalore, where the ant was discovered in 2006. The ants build their nest in the Frangipani plant species Plumeria alba and Plumeria rubra. While they live in colonies like other ants, they forage individually on tree trunks. The spines on the head and thorax are blunt, thus differentiating this species from others. When foraging, these ants raise their gaster high up in the air, very similar to the acrobat ants, Crematogaster. The species differs from other known species in the smaller size of worker and queen ants, the sculpted thorax and pedicel, colouration, six well defined mandibular teeth, and the lesser number of rugosities between the frontal carinae.

It began as a school for agriculture under the auspices of the University of Frankfurt. During World War II, the lower fields became an interrogation center for the German Air Force. After World War II, the United States Army also used it as an interrogation center and intelligence post. In 1968, it became the command and control center for the United States Army Movements Control Agency - Europe (USAMCAEUR). Today it has been rebuilt as a German housing area.  History   Prior to World War II (1926-1939)  Prior to World War II, what later became known as Auswertstelle West during World War II, was an educational farm established, in 1936, under the auspices of the University of Frankfurt. Students learned gardening, bee keeping, animal husbandry as well as general farming techniques. It was in essence an agricultural learning center.Spratt, Jack. The History of Camp King.  World War II  During World War II, the land below the school was adapted to military use as Auswertstelle West also usually erroneously called Dulag Luft. The discrepancy arises due to the post initially being both the Dulag and the interrogation center. Dulag Luft, initially on the post but later transferred to Frankfurt and later Wetzlar.Toliver, Raymond F. The Interrogator. Atglen, PA: Schiffer Publishing LTD., 1997 Activities at Auswertstelle West were intelligence-related. Captured allied air crews were brought to the post for interrogation. Once the interrogations were completed, they were transferred to their Stalag. The center housed many types of intelligence to include unit histories on most allied air forces. During this time the post also picked up its nickname \\"The Goat Farm\\". As mentioned earlier, the lands acquisitioned for military use were the lands below the school, which were agricultural. In one of the fields was home to a nasty goat that was noted for chasing prisoners who attempted to invade its territory.Rollings, Charles. \\"Dulag Luft\\" After the Battle, issue 106 After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the British convened a war crimes trial due to the allegations of ill treatment of British Prisoners of War interrogated at this facility. The hearing, known as the \\"Dulag Luft Trial\\", was convened in Wuppertal, Germany, beginning on November 26, 1945. Four officers were charged: Killenger, Junge, Eberhardt, and Boehringer. Killenger and Junge were sentenced to five years confinement. Eberhardt received three years. Boehringer was acquitted. Meanwhile, the facility itself was put by the victors to their own use (see following).  Post World War II (1945-1953)  As the war ended, the Americans stumbled across the post. Because the facilities were already designed for interrogations and intelligence gathering it was decided to continue using it for intelligence-gathering. Under U.S. control, the post was originally, unofficially, known as Camp Sibert (after General Edwin Sibert, the senior intelligence officer for the U.S. Zone), however it should not be confused with the domestic U.S. post of Camp Sibert in Alabama. Department of Defense records indicate that several Mobile Field Interrogation Units moved into the post to serve at the army and army group levels. On September 19, 1946, (General Order 264) named the intelligence center \\"Camp King\\", after Colonel Charles B. King, an intelligence officer who died on June 22, 1944, while accompanying a patrol bringing back prisoners.US Military records Officially European Command Intelligence Center, Oberursel, it served as a United States interrogation center, engaged initially in denazification, and later for defectors from, and agents of, the Warsaw Pact. This included many intelligence sources as well as scientists. The book The History of Camp King lists the following people: : Karl Brandt, Hitler‚Äôs personal surgeon and in charge of sanitation : Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz, Commander of the German navy, : Hans Frank, Reich Minister, Governor-General of occupied Poland : Reich Marshal Hermann G√∂ring, Chief of the German Air Force, : Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Chief of Operations Staff of the German Armed Forces : Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht : Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, Supreme Commander West Some civilians were held at the post, including German test pilot Hanna Reitsch and‚Äîat the request of the FBI, before her transfer to the United States and trial for treason‚Äîthe German-American Mildred Elizabeth Sisk, one of the propagandists referred to as \\"Axis Sally\\". In July 1946 General Reinhard Gehlen arrived on the post and established the Gehlen Organization which later went on to become the BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst, or \\"Federal Intelligence Service\\").Silver, Arnold M \\"Memories of Oberursel; Questions, Questions, Questions\\", Intelligence and National Security, Vol 8, No 2 published by Frank Cass, LondonPruitt,Randy. \\"Camp King: A casern with a past\\" Stars and Stripes Newspaper, European Edition January 18, 1993  1953-1968  In 1953 Camp King was assigned to the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. The post was still used as an interrogation center but also assumed intelligence duties as a command center for many field offices in Europe.The 513th Military Intelligence Brigade website The post was a major intelligence center for the European Theater. The unit supported many field offices throughout Germany. The units power was usurped as the unit became so large that instead of command and control it actually served in more of a support role. Col Franz Ross rectified this and the unit resumed its actual function.Koehler, John. STASI; The Untold Story of The East German Secret Police. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1999 In the fall of 1968, the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade merged with the 66th Military Intelligence Group and relocated to the McGraw Kaserne in Munich, Germany.  1968 to 1993  In 1968 the United States Army Movements Control Center - Europe (USAMCAEUR) was assigned to Camp King. The organization was reflagged on 1 April 1975 as the 4th Transportation Brigade (redesignated 4th Transportation Command on 16 April 1981), reactivating the colors of a unit that had been in Vietnam and inactivated on 28 June 1972 at Fort Lewis, WA, after its return. Its mission, as stated in military records, was to operate integrated transportation service in support of US forces in Central Europe. The responsibilities encompassed: * Operation of a military highway transportation system primarily known as the 37th Transportation Group (Trucks and Containers) * Operation of a military water terminals, notably in Bremerhaven, Germany, and Rotterdam, Netherlands (container ports). * Reception, processing, and on-carriage transportation of military units deployed in Europe * Movement and control of personnel and material. * Traffic management for US forces in Central Europe. * Preparation of USAREUR wartime movement program. * Intra-theater transport, employing both US Air Force and US Army aircraft. * Traffic regulation services for US forces in Central Europe. The unit was inactivated in 1991 during the post-Cold War drawdown and its mission assigned to the 1st Transportation Movement Control Agency, which was formed from the command and control section of the former 4th TRANSCOM. In the spring of 1990, Headquarters, 22d Signal Brigade was moved to Camp King.  1993 to present In 1993 the post was deactivated and was returned to the German Government. Since that time it has been redeveloped into a housing area. In honor of the past, the people of Oberursel have named the area Camp King.Sewo website There is a small monument in the housing area to the history of the area as a military base.

Born in Norwalk, Connecticut and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Pearlman received a degree in English from Columbia University in New York, and began his career in opera as a resident stage director at the Metropolitan Opera from 1964 to 1967 where he worked with Gian Carlo Menotti, Franco Zeffirelli, Luchino Visconti and Tyrone Guthrie. While serving as assistant director for an absent Zeffirelli, Pearlman directed his first opera, Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1962. These experiences led to his first credited direction, the first American staging of Berlioz's B√©atrice et B√©n√©dict for the Washington National Opera in the 1964-65 season. After a period as a staff director at the Metropolitan Opera, he became General Director of Washington Opera from 1967 to 1970. His work there included a version of The Medium recorded by Columbia, the operatic debut of film star Madeline Kahn, and a highly regarded film/live action production of Turn of the Screw with Benita Valente and Eleanor Steber. In the years that followed, Pearlman made numerous directing debuts across the U.S. His association with San Francisco Opera's Spring Opera Theatre began in 1971 with Donizetti's Don Pasquale and continued with six more productions through 1976. Pearlman staged the world premiere of George Rochberg's The Confidence Man at the Santa Fe Opera in 1982. In 1971, he directed the first professionally mounted production of The Who's rock opera Tommy starring Bette Midler, for Seattle Opera. In 1987 he staged and produced the premiere of Reaching for the Moon, a hitherto-unperformed musical by George and Ira Gershwin. From 1976 to 1995, Pearlman served as director of the Eastman Opera Theatre at Rochester University's Eastman School of Music where he trained many important singers including Ren√©e Fleming. His staging of Conrad Susa's chamber opera, \\"Transformations,\\" produced in Carmel Valley, California in 1977, featured Eastman School of Music students. In 1995 Pearlman was appointed director of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, the Lyric Opera of Chicago's apprenticeship program where he helped launch the careers of scores of young singers, including Nicole Cabell, Erin Wall, Maria Kanyova, Dina Kuznetsova, Matthew Polenzani, David Cangelosi and Christopher Feigum. Pearlman productions had a reputation for both faithful adherence to the intentions of the composer and bold interpretation. A production of Monteverdi‚Äôs L'incoronazione di Poppea was updated to Mussolini's Italy in the 1930s, a production of Mozart's The Magic Flute featuring a live boa constrictor, and a staging of Britten's Albert Herring was a wicked send-up of then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative utopia. \\"Opera is the music,\\" he once said. \\"If you try to go against that, it never comes out right.\\" Also active as a writer and translator, his translations of La boh√®me, La P√©richole, Faust, La finta giardiniera, and La cambiale di matrimonio (rechristened The IOU Wedding) are frequently performed. He died from cancer at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

Semen is a Basque name. It is either the Basque version of the biblical name Simon or a native Basque name based on the word seme (meaning \\"son\\").

(died 846), called Mostelanicus, was the Count of Bordeaux and Saintes from 840 and Duke of Gascony from 845. He was either the son or grandson of Seguin I, the duke appointed by Charlemagne. When Louis the Pious subdued Aquitaine and took it from his rebellious grandson Pepin II in 839, he began partitioning it into counties for those loyal to him. Seguin was one of the new counts. It was probably the emperor's intention to install a duke with local connections to offset the power of Sancho S√°nchez, the local factional leader who opposed both Pepin and then Louis. Seguin continued to support Louis until his death and then his successor in the west, Charles the Bald, but his fidelity to the latter wavered and he went over to the side of Pepin. He was rewarded with the title of dux Wasconum--Duke of Gascony--which probably referred to the Frankish march against the Gascons of Sancho. In Autumn 845, Seguin marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes but was captured and put to death. Notes Sources *Monlezun, Jean Justin.

Many celebrated writers, artists, comedians and politicians began their careers at the \\"Jacko\\", as it is often called, including: Theodor Geisel (who first took the name Seuss as a pseudonym so that he could continue to work on the Jack O‚ÄôLantern after he was banned from participating in college activities for violating Prohibition. After graduating, he felt his alter ego deserved a degree as well, and began signing his artwork 'Dr. Seuss'), Chris Miller (who based his short stories in National Lampoon on his undergraduate experiences at Dartmouth College, and subsequently turned them into the movie Animal House), Norman MacLean, Buck Henry, and Robert Reich. The magazine was referenced in the opening line of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story The Lost Decade, which was first published in Esquire in 1939. The Jack O'Lantern's website is available here.

It provided thousands of troops to the Union Army, as well as millions of dollars in supplies, equipment, food, and support to the soldiers. Public sentiments on the war Prior to the Civil War, residents of Cleveland viewed the slaveholding South based on political affiliation. While a majority of Clevelanders tended to side with the abolitionist North, not all of them loathed slavery, nor were all convinced that a civil war would resolve ideological differences between North and South. As the 1860 election year approached and impending clouds of war loomed, Cleveland's newspapers reflected divisions in the city. For example, The Cleveland Herald and Gazette and The Cleveland Leader, both largely Republican papers, argued that Southern injustices had driven John Brown to raid Harpers Ferry in October 1859. The Plain Dealer, a largely Democratic publication, blamed Brown and abolitionist Republicans for the raid. Republican leader Abraham Lincoln spoke in the city during the 1859 gubernatorial election, and won 58% of the vote in 9 of 11 wards for the Presidency in 1860. As the secession crisis loomed closer, the partisan rhetoric of Cleveland newspapers became more and more heated. The Herald celebrated Lincoln's victory as one of right over wrong, of Unionists over secession-minded southern Democrats, while the Leader dismissed threats of the South's secession. The Plain Dealer, meanwhile, warned that secession was imminent. Lincoln came through Cleveland on his way to Washington, D.C. for his inauguration. When war finally did break out with the Confederate firing on Fort Sumter in April 1861, Cleveland's Democrats and Republicans decided to end their dispute and united to form the National Union party to support Lincoln's war effort. However, this coalition did not go untested. Economic impact of the war The Civil War years brought an economic boom to Cleveland. The city made the transition from a small town to an industrial giant. Railroad iron and gun-carriage axles were manufactured for military use. Due to the cutoff of Southern trade, Cleveland opened its first tobacco factory, T. Maxfield & Co., in 1862. The city's garment industry also began to prosper. The German Woolen Factory (also in 1862) became the first company to manufacture wool cloth in Cleveland. By 1865, its banks held $2.25 million in capital and $3.7 million in deposits. In 1863, 22% of all U.S. warships built for use on the Great Lakes were built in Cleveland. That figure increased by 1865 to 44%. Civilian aid to the military centered on establishment and maintenance of the Soldiers' Aid Society of Northern Ohio (1861), the U.S. General Hospital (1862), Camp Taylor (1861), and Camp Cleveland (1862). Food, blankets, and reading material were provided by citizens to recruits at both military camps until government stores and equipment could be distributed. Memorialization and lingering issues Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument was built to commemorate the more than 9,000 individuals from the county who served in the Civil War. When the war ended, Cleveland welcomed home troops after service in the field, treating them to a meal and a short welcoming ceremony on Public Square before they marched to Camp Cleveland for payment and discharge from the army. Those Clevelanders who died in the war were honored at Woodland Cemetery with the memorials commemorating the 7th Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 23rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Another famous regiment with Cleveland ties was the 8th Ohio Infantry, which helped repel Pickett's Charge. In April 1865, the Lincoln funeral train was brought to Cleveland. A large public funeral was held and his coffin was displayed on Public Square. The issue of full emancipation still lingered. The Herald and the Leader had supported the proposed Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, commending Lincoln \\"for the stalwart blow he struck for freedom and for the peace and future tranquility of the Union.\\" The Plain Dealer, on the other hand, argued that the only purpose of the war was to preserve the Union and that making \\"citizens of the entire black population\\" would ultimately tarnish the white race. The Cuyahoga County Soldier's and Sailors' Monument was erected in Public Square and dedicated July 4, 1894 as a memorial to the over 9,000 individuals from the county who served the Union during the American Civil War. The interior of the structure features 38 marble tablets inscribed with the names of veterans who served honorably from the region. Of the four life-size bronze relief panels, one is designed to commemorate the efforts of local women during the war, notably the women of the Northern Ohio Sanitary Commission. Local members of the United States Colored Troops are also honored. The names of 107 members of the USCT discovered through research were added in 2019. The monument remains open to the public to this day.

The Union Central Insurance Company building in Forest Park, suburb of Cincinnati OH. Built 1964  Fountain Square  Tyler Davidson Fountain, centerpiece of Fountain Square Fountain Square is a public square in Downtown Cincinnati, located at Fifth Street and Vine. Its centerpiece is the landmark bronze Tyler Davidson Fountain. The square is a popular hardscape, surrounded by hotels, banks, department stores, and restaurants. The space was donated to the city of Cincinnati by prominent citizen Henry Probasco and dedicated on its completion in 1871 to his brother-in-law, Tyler Davidson. In 1998, the fountain underwent extensive restoration. In September 2005, the fountain was temporarily moved to the Cincinnati Art Museum while Square was extensively renovated. The fountain was returned to a different location on the Square on August 19, 2006, in preparation for its re-opening in early October 2006. Fountain Square was featured in the credits of the television series WKRP in Cincinnati.  Riverfront  Cincinnati's riverfront skyline Being situated on the Ohio River, Cincinnati is home to several prominent bridges that connect the downtown to Covington, Kentucky and Newport, Kentucky. In fact, there are more bridges that cross the Ohio River in Cincinnati than at any other place on the River. These bridges include the historic and picturesque John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge, which served as a prototype for the Brooklyn Bridge; the Daniel Carter Beard Bridge (aka The Big Mac Bridge); and the Newport Southbank Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Purple People Bridge), which is the longest pedestrian-only bridge in the United States connecting two states. Cincinnatians place a great value on the riverfront for its entertainment and economic benefits. The riverfront is home to both Paul Brown Stadium home of the Cincinnati Bengals, and to Great American Ball Park home of the Cincinnati Reds, as well as to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. \\"The Banks\\", a site planned for future mixed commercial, residential and public recreational use is also on the riverfront. The annual WEBN Fireworks on Labor Day are celebrated at the river, as is Tall Stacks, the largest gathering of steam riverboats in the nation. Many cultural festivals are held at Sawyer Point, including the Cincy Blues Fest and the Cincinnati Celtic Festival, formerly held at Ault Park. Coney Island is on the river several miles east (up-river) from the Downtown area.  Neighborhoods  Over-the-Rhine Cincinnati's unique geography nestles its neighborhoods in small basins and the hillsides that overlook them. Because of this, many of the city's neighborhoods developed very strong identities. Today's outer neighborhoods such as Clifton, Hyde Park, Mount Washington, Westwood, College Hill, and Carthage were originally settled as separate villages, with business sections of their own. Over-the-Rhine was an important neighborhood in German American history. Northside also has its own identity. Also highly important to the city's landscape is the division into \\"East Side and West Side.\\" The division came about after the construction of Interstate Route 71, which runs north from Kentucky towards Columbus, Ohio. The rivalry has been intense at times (limited violence or reported discrimination), but is considered mostly light- hearted, although a good number of city residents take the division more seriously. Accents, fashion, attitudes, city planning (i.e., the way the houses are laid out), financial demographics, and other items are some of the stereotypes and behaviors that separate the two distinctions. Though this division is often considered a point of contention in the city, it has only led to limited incidents of violence or litigious discrimination, and is considered more of a \\"charming quirk\\" than a divisive hindrance to society.  Larger divisions  Interstates 71 and 75 define the four major areas of the city. :1. The area in between I-75 and I-71 tends to be denser and more urban and can be further divided into four smaller areas that decrease in density as one moves further away from the river. (1) The central business district is the area south of Central Parkway and surrounded on three sides by Interstate Highways 75 and 71. (2) A densely populated urban area surrounds the central business district to the west and north, filling up the rest of the low, flat basin between the two highways and extending all the way to the foothills. Its major components are the West End and Over-the-Rhine. 3) To the north where the hills begin is the Uptown area, the area surrounding the University of Cincinnati. This area is the second major business district featuring the other sizable collection of high-rise buildings and public institutions in the city, such as the aforementioned university and the Cincinnati Zoo. A large number of hospitals are located here as well. Many people, including a large number of students, call this diverse and densely populated area home. (4) North of Uptown is a large residential area, home to many well established neighborhoods such as Avondale, Clifton, Bond Hill and Evanston. Again, major city institutions are common here, such as Xavier University in Evanston and Cincinnati Gardens, the city‚Äôs former NBA venue, in Bond Hill. :2. Just west of Downtown, I-75 follows the Mill Creek Valley as it winds its way north from the river. The Mill Creek Valley is the industrial heart of the city and the center of production, storage and freight transportation. Interstate 75 is a major transnational trucking route and the valley contains the city's main rail complex and a water port where Mill Creek meets the Ohio River. The size and complexity of this area physically separates the West Side from the rest of the city. Accessing the West Side from the east usually requires crossing any one of several large viaducts, which accentuates the East/West division. :3. The area west of I-75, the West Side, is a residential area. It is popularly known for its working class character. :4. The East Side, east of I-71, is also largely residential. It is popularly known as an upper middle class area. The suburbs of the city also tend to follow this pattern, with higher density found between the two highways (the business centers of Blue Ash, Evendale and Sharonville, for instance), heavy industry and freight located along Mill Creek and I-75 (The sprawling GE Aviation plant, for instance), and residential suburbs to the east and west. In Kentucky the pattern continues, with densely populated Covington and Newport located between the 71/75 and 471 interstates, and lower density residential cities such as Villa Hills and Fort Thomas to either side.  New development projects  Fountain Square was renovated by 3CDC in 2005 Much of the new development plans are run through the Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC) which was formed in July 2003 as part of the overall system to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of development activities in the City, as recommended by The Cincinnati Economic Development Task Force. 3CDC works collaboratively with the City and the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority to take full advantage of each organization's resources and abilities. They plan to develop in three specific areas: The Banks, Fountain Square, Over-The-Rhine Cincinnati's City Manager Office also organizes and promotes development within the city, through the Economic Development Division. EDD serves as a liaison between the City and developers, development authorities, and development corporations that are seeking to promote development within the City. These are broken down into Commercial, Mixed-Use, and Residential.

The production process is not linear because other factors must be considered, including marketable and non-marketable goods, financial benefits, management practices, and the environmental implications, of those management practices. Forests include market and non- market products. Marketable products include goods that have a market price. Timber is the main one, with prices that range from a few hundred dollars per thousand board feet (MBF) to several thousand dollars for a veneer log. Others include grazing/fodder, specialty crops such as mushrooms or berries, usage fees for recreation or hunting, and biomass. Forests also provide some non- market values which have no current market price. Examples of non-market goods would be improving water quality, air quality, aesthetics, and carbon sequestration. The more biodiverse the hardwood-forest ecosystem, the more challenges and opportunities its managers face. Managers aim for sustainable forest management to keep their cash crop renewing itself, using silvicultural practices that include growing, selling, controlling insects and most diseases, providing manure, applying herbicle treatments, and thinning. Fertilization can stop the growth rate and amount of plant material, thus possibly increasing the number of wildlife that can inhabit a site. Invasive species control maintains an area's structure and native composition. But management can also harm the ecosystem; for example, machinery used in a timber harvest can compact the soil, stress the root system, reduce tree growth, lengthen the time needed for a stand to mature to harvestability. Machinery can also damage the understory, disturbing wildlife habitat and prevent regeneration. See also * Forest farming References *Nyland, R.D. 2002. Silviculture: Concepts and Applications.

The primary interest in riparian forest and aquatic ecosystems under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) is the need to restore stream habitat for fish populations, particularly Anadromous salmonids. Some of these forests have been grazed by cattle or other livestock. The heavy hooves of these animals compact the soil. This compaction does not allow the water to be absorbed into the ground, so the water runs off into the stream carrying topsoil along the way. The simplification of the stream itself has also had negative effects. The large woody debris in the streams has been removed to allow for easy access to the stream and for better travel in the streams themselves. But the faster moving current erodes the stream banks, filling the stream with more sediment. The removal of trees on the stream banks also leads to erosion and stream degradation. Another effect of the removal of trees is an increase in stream temperatures because of the lack of shade. These changes to riparian forests can be fixed through three steps; # Creation of riparian reserves # Restoration of channel complexity # Silviculture practices These steps will help restore riparian forest ecosystems which will directly help the salmon populations.  Riparian forest restoration  The following steps used to help restore and maintain healthy riparian forests came from the Bureau of Land Management‚Äôs best management practices (BMPs) in the Roseburg District. The first step towards riparian forest restoration should be the establishment of riparian reserves. The second step is to restore channel complexity. The third step is to apply silvicultural treatments to restore large conifers. The large conifer species would be western red cedar Thuja plicata and western hemlock Tsuga heterophylla. These three steps will help direct the ecosystem back to its pre-disturbed state.  Riparian reserves  The riparian reserve is the designated width from the stream where restrictions on what can be done are placed in order to protect the functions of the land and water in that reserved area. There are three different riparian reserve widths: # Fish bearing stream widths are on each side of the stream. # Permanently flowing non-fish bearing stream widths are . # Seasonally following or intermittent stream widths are . Some activities that are restricted or limited in the riparian reserve include: # Cattle grazing. # Mineral lease operations. # Chemical loading operations or similar toxic activities. # Disturbance of unstable banks and headwalls. # Operation of tracked equipment on slopes greater than 30% # Chemical applications # Timber harvest or fuel wood cutting ( except for salvage operations & management of stands) # Road construction.  Channel complexity restoration  The placement of large woody debris (LWD) in streams creates pools and side channels. The pools provide habitat for aquatic organisms while the side channels help alleviate flooding. The LWD also controls the routing of sedimentation. The source of the LWD should be outside of the riparian reserve whenever possible so as not to promote erosion in the riparian reserve. However, if usable trees are generated during management, then they can be used to add LWD. Any trees that naturally fall in the stream are an advantage and should be left.  Silviculture techniques  There are three silvicultural techniques that will help restore large conifers (western red cedar & western hemlock) in riparian forests. Since silviculture is a cyclical process, the numbering of the techniques doesn‚Äôt denote the order in which these operations should begin or the importance of the step. # Site preparation # Seeding # Single tree selection  Site preparation  The role of site preparation is to modify current growing vegetative conditions making the site suitable for the desired seedlings. Western red cedar and western hemlock are the desired seedlings. The goals of site preparation in this case are: # Control competing ground vegetation # Erosion control # Nutrient balancing # Promote decomposition of surface litter layer # Expose mineral soil. Mechanical site preparation will be difficult Because of the heavy equipment‚Äôs size, and inability to maneuver in the small spaces left by single tree selection. Prescribed burning is another method of site preparation, but will not work because the shallow roots of western hemlock would get damaged, hurting the seed sources. Prescribed burning would also damage the thin bark of both western hemlock and red cedar girdling the trees. Chemical applications are restricted in the riparian reserves because of the danger of runoff or leaching of chemicals into the stream. So the methods that will be used for site preparation are: # Passive site preparation # Manual site preparation. The passive site preparation will entail keeping the debris created by naturally falling trees where they land. Keeping the slash and smaller trees that are generated by tree selections on the ground is another passive site preparation that will work well within the riparian forest. This will supply a good rotting seed bed for both Western Redcedar and Western Hemlock. Both species also can use disturbed mineral seed beds for regeneration from seed. To obtain disturbed mineral soil in the small areas that single tree selection creates manually turning up the soil with hand tools or small tillers is the manual site preparation option.  Seeding  Seeding is done following site preparation. Seeding is one way to ensure the survival of the desired species on a site. With seeding, foresters have control of genetic makeup of the species and the source of the seed. Natural regeneration may be obtained because of the high numbers of annual seed crops (100,000‚Äì1 million/acre). Where annual seed production is low western red cedar can be direct seeded in the fall if the soil moisture is adequate. High numbers of seeds will be needed to reach the desired stocking level. Containerized stocking also works well. In the coastal ranges, 2-year-old bare-root stock seems to be most efficient. Containerized stock plantings in the spring perform better than bare-root stock in the interior. Western hemlock has a good rate of survival in a wide range of conditions. This will allow for natural regeneration on sites that have good organic or mineral soil. If the site is not suitable for natural regeneration then the use of container-grown stock should be used. Hemlock doesn‚Äôt survive well with the bare-root stock method. Both western red cedar and western hemlock are able to reproduce by some form of vegetative reproduction. Western red cedar reproduces in three ways of vegetative form; layering, rooting of fallen branches, and branch development on fallen trees. In some areas of the Cascades, this form of regeneration is the most successful. Another option for the establishment of red cedar is the use of stem cuttings. Western hemlock also has vegetative reproduction capabilities. Hemlock can be propagated by layering and from cuttings.  Single-tree selection  Single-tree selection harvest method works best within the riparian ecosystem. Single-tree selection is a good method to keep the western hemlock and western red cedar on the site. If the stand was left alone and the forest naturally created gaps for succession then other species that are less tolerant than the desired tree species of western red cedar and western hemlock could overtake the created gaps. Single-tree selection will contribute minimally to erosion, still provide habitat for wildlife, be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, and follow the best management practices (BMPs) that are associated with riparian forests. Single-tree selection gives the forest a great vertical distribution of foliage. The last reason for doing a single tree selection is that it spreads out income over longer period of time. This could help pay for any costs associated with the stand‚Äôs management. Single-tree selection replicates the natural process called gap-phase. Gap-phase is an event that happens in a forest when a tree in the upper canopy of the forest falls down, usually form a strong wind. The gap formed in the upper canopy allows enough sunlight to come through the opening and reach saplings at the forest floor. These saplings can grow and eventually penetrate the canopy. The natural gap-phase process may only open the total stand by 1 percent. Single tee selection is different from the natural process because the openings are created more often. Since both species are tolerant an opening of the stand by 10 percent each cutting cycle would be enough for a stand to do well. An uneven-aged forest is a result of periodically opening the canopy. Since both Western Hemlock and Western Redcedar are shade tolerant species, a basal area of is recommended and would be the maximum basal area the stand could support. The q-factor for these species is 1.2 because of their tolerance. So the number of trees in the size class would be 7 trees. A cutting cycle of 20 years is recommended to ensure the stand is following the ideal stocking curve for western red cedar and western hemlock. Western Redcedar can tolerate mixed- species conditions in the understory and is often overtopped by species such as Douglas-fir, Western White Pine and Western Hemlock (Minore, 1990). Western Hemlock responds well to release after long periods of suppression. After 50 to 60 years, the advanced regeneration will grow vigorously after overstory removal (Packee, 1990). The single-tree selection works well with these growth characteristics of both species.

The stories as well as the book were written for the Boy's Own Paper and published by the Religious Tract Society, with illustrations by Gordon Browne. It was adapted into the film of the same name. Reed had no personal experience of a public school education himself; consequently, the book lacked some of the realism of other comparable books like Tom Brown's Schooldays and Eric, or, Little by Little. It also avoids much of the overt moralising and sentimentality found in these books, though a muscular type of Christianity makes occasional appearances. However, the book was written with great enthusiasm and it started a tradition of boarding school stories in British juvenile fiction that lasted until the end of World War II. The novel was serialized as a 14-part 2-page comic in Look and Learn magazine between December 1979 and March 1980. The plot revolves around the fall into turpitude of a senior schoolboy named Loman, under the influence of a manipulative and dissolute innkeeper. Loman's young prot√©g√© (his fag - a junior boy who acts as the unpaid servant of a senior) is also endangered by association with the innkeeper, but is eventually rescued by his older brother. This brother is falsely suspected of having cheated in a major examination and is ostracised by his fellow schoolmates. The plot is resolved by the vindication of the right-thinking and the forgiveness of those who have fallen into error. There is much coverage of schoolboy societies and the forms of self-governance that the scholars have established within their traditions, and of descriptions of various forms of sport.

This includes the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage; as well as, pathogens that may cause disease especially if food is improperly cooked or stored. Those used to produce fermented foods such as cheese, yogurt, bread, beer, and wine. Then those researchers with other useful roles such as producing probiotics.  Food safety  A microbiologist working in a biosafety laboratory tests for high risk pathogens in food. Food safety is a major focus of food microbiology. Numerous agents of disease and pathogens are readily transmitted via food which includes bacteria and viruses. Microbial toxins are also possible contaminants of food; However, microorganisms and their products can also be used to combat these pathogenic microbes. Probiotic bacteria, including those that produce bacteriocins can kill and inhibit pathogens. Alternatively, purified bacteriocins such as nisin can be added directly to food products. Finally, bacteriophages, viruses that only infect bacteria can be used to kill bacterial pathogens. Thorough preparation of food, including proper cooking, eliminates most bacteria and viruses. However, toxins produced by contaminants may not be liable to change to non-toxic forms by heating or cooking the contaminated food due to other safety conditions.  Fermentation  Fermentation is one of the methods to preserve food and alter its quality. Yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is used to leaven bread, brew beer and make wine. Certain bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, are used to make yogurt, cheese, hot sauce, pickles, fermented sausages and dishes such as kimchi. A common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less hospitable to other microorganisms, including pathogens and spoilage-causing microorganisms, thus extending the food's shelf-life. Some cheese varieties also require molds to ripen and develop their characteristic flavors. Microbial biopolymers Several microbially produced biopolymers are used in the food industry. Alginate Alginates can be used as thickening agents. Although listed here under the category 'Microbial polysaccharides', commercial alginates are currently only produced by extraction from brown seaweeds such as Laminaria hyperborea or L. japonica. Poly-Œ≥-glutamic acid Poly-Œ≥-glutamic acid (Œ≥-PGA) produced by various strains of Bacillus has potential applications as a thickener in the food industry. Food testing Faculty of Food Technology, Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. To ensure safety of food products, microbiological tests such as testing for pathogens and spoilage organisms are required. This way the risk of contamination under normal use conditions can be examined and food poisoning outbreaks can be prevented. Testing of food products and ingredients is important along the whole supply chain as possible flaws of products can occur at every stage of production. Food Testing Laboratories Apart from detecting spoilage, microbiological tests can also determine germ content, identify yeasts and molds, and salmonella. For salmonella, scientists are also developing rapid and portable technologies capable of identifying unique variants of Salmonella . Rapid Testing and Identification of Salmonella in Foods Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a quick and inexpensive method to generate numbers of copies of a DNA fragment at a specific band (\\"PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction),\\" 2008). For that reason, scientists are using PCR to detect different kinds of viruses or bacteria, such as HIV and anthrax based on their unique DNA patterns. Various kits are commercially available to help in food pathogen nucleic acids extraction,FOOD PATHOGEN DNA EXTRACTION filter paper card PCR detection, and differentiation. The detection of bacterial strands in food products is very important to everyone in the world, for it helps prevent the occurrence of food borne illness. Therefore, PCR is recognized as a DNA detector in order to amplify and trace the presence of pathogenic strands in different processed food.

Running north, it is five miles (8 km) to the first highway intersection, SH-22, just west of Kenefic. Highway 48 continues on to the north, passing through the community of Folsom, and at Coleman, SH-48A spurs off to the west, towards the town of Milburn. Seven miles ahead is Wapanucka, and the junction with SH-7. Nine miles past Wapanucka, SH-31 intersects, heading to the east, and in seven more miles Highway 48 reaches the town of Tupelo. Just north of Tupelo, SH-48 intersects SH-3, and then continues for to Allen, where it joins SH-1 for a seven-mile (11 km) concurrency to Atwood. At Atwood, SH-48 splits off to the north, crosses the Canadian River,(the road originally angled west parallel to the river but was eventually rerouted after years of the river undercutting the roadbed) and soon enters the city of Holdenville, seat of Hughes County.

Early years He was the son of Edgar J. Kaufmann, a wealthy Pittsburgh businessman and philanthropist who owned Kaufmann's department store, and his wife Liliane. Kaufmann Jr. attended the School for Arts and Crafts at the Austrian Museum of Applied Art in Vienna, in the late 1920s. He studied painting and typography for three years with Victor Hammer in Florence. After reading Frank Lloyd Wright's autobiography, Kaufmann decided to become a resident apprentice in architecture at Wright's Taliesin East School and Studio from 1933 to 1934. According to fallingwater.org, he was particular about spelling his name \\"Edgar Kaufmann jr.\\" Career When he left Wright's Taliesin Fellowship in 1935, he joined the family business and became merchandise manager for home furnishings, and in 1938, was elected secretary of the Kaufmann Department Stores, Inc. In 1940, Edgar wrote to Alfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art, proposing the Organic Design in Home Furnishings Competition, won by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen. That same year, he left Kaufmann's to join the Museum of Modern Art. He served with the Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1946 during World War II. Afterwards, he was director of the Industrial Design Department at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York City. Edgar's greatest accomplishment during his tenure at MOMA was the 'Good Design' program of 1950 to 1955, in which the museum joined with the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, promoting good design in household objects and furnishings. From 1963 to 1986, Kaufmann was an adjunct professor of Architecture and Art History at Columbia University. He authored several books on Wright architecture and modern design, and was a contributor to Arts + Architecture journal and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Fallingwater Kaufmann strongly supported his father's decision to commission Frank Lloyd Wright for the famous 1936 Fallingwater house over Bear Run, in Stewart Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. After his father's death in 1955, Kaufmann inherited the Fallingwater house, continuing to use and share it as a mountain retreat until 1963. Then, he entrusted the Wright structures and several hundred acres of the surrounding pristine Laurel Highlands lands in the Allegheny Mountains to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy as an architectural house museum and conservation open space preserve, in memory of his parents. Personal life Kaufmann, who did not marry and had no children, died in 1989. His ashes were scattered around the property at Fallingwater by his partner Paul May√©n, with whom he shared his life since the 1950s. May√©n oversaw the building of the Fallingwater pavilion from 1979 to 1981, which houses the caf√©, gift store, and visitor‚Äôs center at Fallingwater. Following his own death in 2000, May√©n's ashes were also scattered at Fallingwater in accordance with his wishes. Kaufmann was among the public figures at the core of the effort to save Olana, the home of Frederic Edwin Church, before it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and subsequently became a New York State Historic Site. Art collection After his death, 21 pieces of his collection of art and sculpture were auctioned off at Sotheby's in New York. They included Mondrian's Facade in Tan and Grey and Composition in a Square, Klee's Face of a Flower, Picasso's Guitar and Pink Fruit Dish, Braque's Harlequin, a Matisse's Nude With Pink Shoes, L√©ger's Forms in Contrast and Acrobats, de Kooning's Untitled III, Calder's Little Tree, Monet's Waterlilies, Duchamp's Small Horse, Giacometti's Woman With a Broken Shoulder, and Mir√≥'s Bird Flying Toward a Silver Tree.

Biography  He was a Frenchman, from Gonesse or La Gonesse, a village near Paris. His father, Guillaume of Lagonesse, had accompanied Charles on his conquest of the Kingdom of Sicily, and died in 1269. Philip was invested by Charles with the fief of Roccaguglielma in 1272. While serving as seneschal of Piedmont, he was sharply defeated in autumn of 1275 and was forced to retreat into Provence, abandoning most of the province. However, before 1278, he had been granted the additional fief of San Nicandro. Made marshal of the Kingdom of Sicily some time after Charles' conquest of that kingdom, he was appointed bailli and vicar-general of Achaea in 1280. His predecessor, Galeran of Ivry, had left the affairs of the principality in disarray, and Philip strove to pay off the troops stationed there and improve the fortresses with funds from the reorganized mint at Glarentza. After the Sicilian Vespers and the revolt of the island of Sicily, he was recalled from Achaea for the ensuing war. He was invested with Giffoni and Vairano in 1284; he was, in addition, Lord of Airola.

This nocturnal insectivore is also referred to as the coqu√≠ pitito in Puerto Rico. Their distinctive song is a single, rising whistle, which is repeated and followed by three clicking sounds. Description The whistling coqui measures between 0.6 and 0.7 inches, but the females can grow to 0.9 in long. Their physical coloration is gray, tan, or gray-brown. Their dorsa have a unique pattern of fine lines that resemble two reverse parenthesis {)(}. Their venters are white, gray, or creamy yellow. Their legs are brown with small toe pads, and they have dark, fine lines on the midline of their snouts. Their throats and thighs are distinctive for their speckled, small brown spots. See references for picture website. Distribution and habitat The whistling coqui is usually found sleeping in the refuge of tree bromeliads (where it also lays its eggs) and coconut husk piles during the day. Several inhabit the southwest flank of the Luquillo Mountains and Guanica‚Äôs dry forest in Puerto Rico, as well as humid areas of Puerto Rico such as Utuado, Cayey, and the Caribbean National Forest. Overall, they range from the Puerto Rican islands (except Mona and Monito) to St. John, St. Thomas, and the British Virgin Islands (except Anegada). The whistling coqui is found in semiarid, wooded areas, such as the dry forest of Gu√°nica and the humid areas of Utuado, Cayey, and Luquillo. They find and use trees, such as bromeliad plants, and leaf litter to hide from predators during the day. Depending on their area, they are found as high as three feet from the ground in trees. Reproduction Males use their songs as mating calls from about three feet from the ground in trees, and are usually heard before dusk and after dawn. Their reproduction, as most of the family Eleutherodactylidae, skips the tadpole phase. Their eggs are laid in humid areas, and the froglets emerge and continue their lives.

It consisted of a single track line connecting Patuxent River, MD to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Despite numerous problems, the railroad was able to survive for 73 years before shutting down in 1954. History Origins The Southern Maryland Railroad (SMR) was incorporated on March 20, 1868 ‚Äúfor the purpose of constructing, maintaining, and working a railroad from some point in Prince George‚Äôs County to Point Lookout.‚Äù As was typical of the roads of the era, the alignment of the right-of-way bisected the peninsula created by the Potomac and Patuxent rivers. A rail line from the major north-south Potomac River crossings into Virginia near Washington, D.C., to a port on the Patuxent River near the Chesapeake Bay would be an ideal line to promote agricultural and mineral business and rail shipments from the counties of this peninsula. A commission was appointed, money was raised, and an engineer was hired to build an eighty-mile rail line. Washington City and Point Lookout Railroad In 1872, a competitor railroad, the Washington City and Point Lookout Railroad was incorporated and authorized to run trains between Washington, D.C., and Point Lookout with connecting steamers to Norfolk, Virginia. They began building a line immediately parallel and adjacent to the SMR. In 1876 the SMR was investigated for defrauding the state of Maryland, the sole shareholder in the company, and went bankrupt without running a single train. In 1878 the WC&PL; was authorized to purchase the SMR but never did. Construction was later restarted in Brandywine where the SMR connected with the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (later the Pope's Creek branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad) and was built in a southeasterly direction. It wasn't until 1881 that the first train was run serving Charlotte Hall and Mechanicsville. By 1884, they'd built twenty-one miles and graded fifty more in Maryland. They also graded and partially laid out the right-of-way for 2.2 miles of railroad from Deanwood to the Maryland line in the District of Columbia. By 1886 they'd laid down ties and some rail in DC, but they never operated trains on this section which later came under control of the Chesapeake Beach Railway. Washington & Potomac Railroad The line went into its next bankruptcy in 1886 and emerged on April 1, 1886, as the Washington & Potomac Railroad (W&P;). The line wouldn't run farther south than Mechanicsville until the U.S. Navy took over during World War II. In 1894, the W&P; merged with the WC&PL;, which was by then in receivership. Washington, Potomac & Chesapeake Railway In 1900, the line went through another bankruptcy and emerged on July 24, 1901, as the Washington, Potomac & Chesapeake Railway. The WP&C; had a contentious relationship with the state. In 1910 they were ordered to run two trains a day - up from one and to drop their prices. The line had trouble fulfilling its obligations and in 1914 the state of Maryland threatened to withdraw their charter. Washington, Brandywine & Point Lookout Railroad At the end of 1917 the line again found itself in bankruptcy and was very nearly scrapped due to the high price of scrap metal during World War I. In 1918, the state of Maryland attempted to have the U.S. government take over control of the railroad. Farmers in the area were able to purchase the line from a salvage firm and in June 1918 the line began running again, this time under the name of the Washington, Brandywine & Point Lookout Railroad. In the 1930s, revenues were dropping due to increased competition from the automobile and the line probably would have been gone for good, except for the intervention of World War II. Navy Control In June 1942, the US Navy took over the line and extended it to the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. The name was changed again, this time to the more accurate Brandywine and Cedar Point Railroad. As late as the mid-1950s the Navy was still operating the line. The Navy operated an \\"accommodation\\" train that connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad in Brandywine until the PRR stopped passenger trains on the Pope's Creek Line in 1949. Pennsylvania Railroad Control In 1953 the railroad fell into disrepair. The extensive maintenance costs were too much to keep it in business and the Brandywine and Cedar Point was closed in 1954. The last regular run was made in July 1954 from the Naval Air Station to Hollywood, MD. Through the late 1950s/early 1960s, PRR trains used the line to deliver aviation fuel to the base. However, when fuel started coming in by barge, the importance of the line dwindled. End of the Line  When train operation ceased, the line was offered for sale by the GSA but there were no takers. Then, on June 26, 1970, the St. Mary's County Commissioners purchased 28 miles of the abandoned right of way from Hughesville, Maryland, to Patuxent River, Maryland. The tracks were removed in the mid-1970s.

The Brandywine terminal was U.S. government property and was maintained by Public Works personnel from Patuxent River. The terminal was turned over to the Air Force just before it burned.

Among his best-known work is The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's. He was a regular and prolific contributor to The Boy's Own Paper (B.O.P.), in which most of his fiction first appeared. Through his family's business, Reed became a prominent typefounder, and wrote a standard work on the subject: History of the Old English Letter Foundries. Reed's father, Charles Reed, was a successful London printer who later became a Member of Parliament (MP). Talbot attended the City of London School before leaving at 17 to join the family business in Fann Street. His literary career began in 1879, when the B.O.P. was launched. The family were staunchly Christian, pillars of the Congregational Church, and were heavily involved in charitable works. However, Reed did not use his writing as a vehicle for moralising, and was dismissive of those early school story writers who did, such as Dean Farrar. Reed's affinity with boys, his instinctive understanding of their standpoint in life and his gift for creating believable characters, ensured that his popularity survived through several generations. He was widely imitated by other writers in the school story genre. In 1881, following the death of his father, Reed became head of the company. By then he had begun his monumental history which was published in 1887. Along with his B.O.P. contributions Reed wrote regular articles and book reviews for his cousin Edward Baines's newspaper, the Leeds Mercury. He was a co-founder and first honorary secretary of the Bibliographical Society, and a trustee for his family's charities. All this activity may have undermined his health; after struggling with illness for most of 1893, Reed died in November that year, at the age of 41. Tributes honoured him both for his contribution to children's fiction and for his work as the definitive historian of English typefounding. Family background Charles Reed MP, father of Talbot Baines Reed The Reeds were descended from John Reed, a colonel in Oliver Cromwell's army during the English Civil War. The family was based in Maiden Newton in the county of Dorset before moving to London at the end of the 18th century. Talbot Reed's grandfather, Andrew Reed (1787‚Äì1862), was a minister of the Congregational Church and the founder of several charitable institutions, including the London Orphan Asylum and a hospital for the incurably sick. He was also a hymn-writer of repute; his \\"Spirit Divine, attend our prayers\\" is still found in several 20th and 21st century hymnals.Morison, pp. 1‚Äì3 Andrew Reed had five sons, the third of whom, Charles Reed (1819‚Äì81), was apprenticed in 1836 to a wool manufacturer in Leeds, Yorkshire, where he also became secretary of the local Sunday School union. Through this work he met Edward Baines, proprietor of the Leeds Mercury one of the town's two MPs. The Baines family had a strong tradition of public and political service; both of Edward Baines's sons followed him into Parliament, the elder, Matthew Talbot Baines, eventually reaching Cabinet rank. Charles Reed was attracted to the youngest Baines offspring, a daughter, Margaret, whom he married in 1844. By this time Charles had left the wool industry and returned to London, where he founded his first business, a printing firm. The family settled in the London district of Hackney where Charles was active in public and religious affairs, with a particular interest in education. He became a member, and later chairman, of the London School Board, and helped to establish the Congregational Church Board of Education. From 1868 to 1881 he was one of Hackney's MPs. He also raised a family of five sons, the third of whom, named Talbot Baines after his distinguished uncle, was born at the family home, \\"Earlsmead\\", on 3 April 1852. Over the years, Charles expanded his business interests, and by 1861 had prospered sufficiently to acquire the Thorowgood type foundry in Fann Street, City of London. Early life The City of London School in Milk Street, Cheapside Talbot Baines Reed grew up in a happy household, dominated by Charles Reed's religious zeal and his belief that hardy outdoor sports were the best means for bringing up boys. This atmosphere of \\"simple, cheerful Puritanism\\" was, according to a friend, \\"eminently suited to [Talbot's] character and disposition\\". Talbot began his education at Priory House School, Clapton,Sime, p. x and in 1864 became a day pupil at the City of London School, a relatively new foundation that had been established in Milk Street, Cheapside, in 1837. Talbot's eldest brother, Charles junior, had been notably successful there, as captain of the school and a leading figure in its cricket and football teams. Talbot soon made his own mark, particularly on the sporting field; a contemporary describes him as \\"full of life and vigour ... his strength of muscle, length of limb, boldness of attack, absolute fearlessness and perfection of nerve always made him conspicuous\\". Reed later showed some reticence about his academic achievements, asserting that one of his few successes was winning \\"the comfortable corner desk near the fire\\", reserved for the bottom place in Mathematics. In fact, in keeping with the school's record of producing men of letters and language scholars, Reed had excellent results in French, Greek and Latin, and had competed for the Sixth Form Latin prize. One of his school contemporaries was H. H. Asquith, the future British prime minister.Morison, pp. 4‚Äì7 Despite evidence of considerable academic ability, Reed did not follow his brother Charles, who went on from the school to Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead, in 1869, Reed left the school to join the family firm, known as Sir Charles Reed & Sons or informally as the Fann Street Foundry, beginning a lifelong association with the printing trade. He found time, however, to pursue many other interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice he walked the from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and arriving at St John's College for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent swimmer, and won a Royal Humane Society medal for saving a cousin from drowning in rough seas. He was an accomplished pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were put to service in the production of a family magazine, The Earlsfield Chronicle, which Reed edited (and largely wrote) from the mid-1870s. The magazine circulated only among the extended Reed family, and included serious articles (\\"Is total abstinence a moral duty?\\") alongside comic verses and cartoons.Cox, pp. 28‚Äì29 Printer and typefounder The Caxton Exhibition, South Kensington, July 1877. In this illustration, W.E. Gladstone stands centre picture; on the right are William Blades (bearded) and, far right, Charles Reed Although Reed would later jokingly describe his work for the family firm as \\"drudgery\\",Quigly, p. 78 in reality he was enthusiastic about the trade and worked hard to master it. Early in his career he met the leading printer and bibliographer of the day, William Blades, from whom he acquired a lasting fascination with the printing and typefounding crafts.Morison, p. 13 While still relatively inexperienced, Reed was asked by Blades to help organise a major exhibition to mark the 400th anniversary of William Caxton's printing of The Game and Playe of the Chesse. This was thought to be the first book printed in England, in 1474, and the exhibition was originally planned for 1874. However, Blades's research indicated that Caxton's first printing in England had been in 1477, of a different book: The Dictes and Notable Wise Sayings of the Philosophers,Bullen (ed.), pp. 8‚Äì9 so the quatercentenary celebrations were rescheduled accordingly.Morison, p. 11 The exhibition was held during the summer of 1877, at South Kensington, and was opened by William Gladstone, the former and future prime minister.Morison, p. 12 It included displays of Caxton's printed works, together with many examples of printing through the intervening years. Reed contributed an essay to the exhibition's catalogue, entitled \\"The Rise and Progress of Type-Founding in England\\".Bullen (ed.), p. xi The exhibition was supported by leading London printers, publishers, booksellers, antiquarians and scholars, and attracted wide public interest. Sir Charles Reed, who had been knighted on Gladstone's recommendation in 1874, died in 1881. A few months later, Talbot's elder brother Andrew retired from the business because of ill health. As a result, at the age of 29, Talbot became the sole managing director of the Fann Street business, a position he held until his death.Morison, pp. 37‚Äì44 In 1878, in response to a suggestion from Blades, Reed began work on a general history of typefounding in England, a task which occupied him intermittently for nearly ten years. Published by Elliot Stock in 1887 under the title of History of the Old English Letter Foundries, the book became a standard text on the subject. Its 21 chapters are illustrated throughout with examples of typefaces and symbols used for four centuries. The text is presented in modern style, but with the initial letter of each chapter ornately drawn from a 1544 pattern.Morison, pp. 48‚Äì50 Also in 1887 Reed produced a revised and enlarged specimen book for the Fann Street foundry, with many new typeface designs and artistic ornamentations. As an acknowledged expert in his field, Reed was in demand as a lecturer to learned societies. Among the papers he delivered were \\"Old and New Fashions in Typography\\", to the Royal Society of Arts in 1890, and \\"On the Use and Classification of a Typographical Library\\", to the Library Association in 1892.Morison, pp. 50‚Äì52 After Blades's death in 1890, Reed prepared his former mentor's unfinished Pentateuch of Printing for publication, adding a long memorial tribute to Blades. His foundry cast custom type such as the Golden Type for William Morris's Kelmscott Press in 1890 and Reed persuaded Morris to deliver a lecture on \\"The Ideal Book\\" for the Bibliographical Society in 1893. The Boy's Own Paper Issue No. 1 of The Boy's Own Paper, 18 January 1879, with Reed's short story \\"My First Football Match\\" The Reed family had longstanding connections with The Religious Tract Society (RTS), which had been founded in 1799 to publish and disseminate material of a Christian nature.Fyfe, p. 357 Talbot's grandfather Andrew Reed, at the age of 12, had attended the Society's inaugural meeting; Charles Reed and his eldest son, Charles junior, were both active members. On 23 July 1878 an RTS subcommittee (including both Charles Reeds) recommended the publication of \\"a magazine for Boys to be issued weekly at a price of one penny\\".Cox, p. 18 Although the Society had frequently expressed a desire to counter the \\"cheap and sensational\\" magazines that were read by young people, its main committee was initially hesitant about this proposal, fearing its financial implications. Finally, however, it felt obliged \\"to attempt an enterprise from which others shrank\\". Thereafter the committee moved swiftly, and the first issue of the new publication, The Boy's Own Paper, was on sale on 18 January 1879.Cox, p. 22 Although at that time his writing experience was limited, Reed was asked by his father and brother to contribute to the new venture, a challenge he accepted enthusiastically.Morison, p. 14 Apart from his stories for The Earlsfield Chronicle, his sole prior experience of magazine writing had been an article entitled \\"Camping Out\\", for the Edinburgh-based young peoples' magazine Morning of Life. This account of a boating excursion on the Thames had appeared in 1875.Morison, p. 17 For the first issue of the B.O.P., Reed wrote a school story, \\"My First Football Match\\" which, accompanied by a half- page illustration, appeared on the front page \\"by An Old Boy\\". The story was very well received, and prompted demands for more about \\"Parkhurst\\", the school where the football match was played. Reed responded with several more tales, among which were \\"The Parkhurst Paper Chase\\" and \\"The Parkhurst Boat Race\\". In the new magazine's first year Reed was a regular contributor of articles and stories on a range of subjects, joining distinguished writers such as G. A. Henty,Morison, p. 21 R.M. Ballantyne and Jules Verne.Cox, pp. 35‚Äì37 A prominent illustrator for the magazine was the artist and mountaineer Edward Whymper.Cox, p. 9 Reed's association with the B.O.P. lasted for the remainder of his life; the magazine would be the initial publisher for almost all his subsequent output of fiction. This commitment to the B.O.P. delayed progress on his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, especially as Reed began writing regular columns and book reviews for the Leeds Mercury, now edited by his cousin, the younger Edward Baines.Morison, pp. 23‚Äì24 The 1880s was a decade of growing national prosperity, and increasing numbers of families from the expanding middle classes were sending their sons to boarding schools. The B.O.P. editor, George Hutchison, felt that such schools would provide the ideal setting for stories in which a boy hero (or heroes) could display Christian principles and strength of character in the face of temptations, and planned to run a long serial story. Reed, who had not himself attended a boarding school, was not the obvious choice as the writer. However, the skill and imagination he had displayed in his short school stories convinced Hutchison that Reed should be given the assignment.Cox, pp. 40‚Äì42 School stories Boys at St. Dominic's: an illustration from the first book edition, 1887 Reed's first response to the request for school stories for The Boy's Own Paper was The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch, which ran for 19 instalments from October 1880 to April 1881. The travels of a schoolboy's pocket watch are charted through school, university and, finally, India at the time of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.Morison, p. 28 The school, \\"Randlebury\\", is believed to be based, like \\"Parkhurst\\", on information Reed received from friends who had boarded at Radley.Cox, pp. 29 and 41‚Äì42 The success of the story encouraged the B.O.P.'s editors to ask Reed to attempt a longer and more ambitious work. The result was The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's, which became the favourite and most influential of all Reed's stories.Quigly, p. 79 Extended over 38 episodes, each a self-contained unit within an overall plot, this was the first of a sequence of school stories, all serialised in the B.O.P. The boarding school milieu was repeated, with a few variations, in The Willoughby Captains (serialised 1883‚Äì84), The Master of the Shell (1887‚Äì88), The Cock-House at Fellsgarth (1891) and Tom, Dick and Harry (1892‚Äì93). Reed followed the suggestion of his editors by setting My Friend Smith (1882‚Äì83) in a different kind of school, a \\"modest establishment for the backward and troublesome\\".Hutchison, G.A., in \\"Preface\\", My Friend Smith, The Religious Tract Society, London 1889 It was, however, the boarding school stories that endured and which became the standard model for school stories for many decades.Quigly, pp. 83‚Äì85 All the serials were quickly issued in book form, and most were reprinted for the benefit of successive generations of boys, up to the 1950s. The model was imitated or copied by other writers for the next half century; according to historian Isabel Quigly, \\"Reed was a better writer than his followers, and has been diminished by their imitations.\\"Quigly, p. 82 In a biographical sketch written in 2004, the historian Jeffrey Richards characterises Reed's work as a mixing of the earlier school story traditions established by Dean Farrar and Thomas Hughes, crafted with a vivid readability. Reed dismissed Farrar's Eric, or, Little by Little as a religious tract thinly disguised as a school story, and sought to produce something more \\"manly\\". Many of the incidents and characterisations introduced by Reed in St. Dominic's became standard elements in his subsequent stories, and in those of his imitators. Quigly lists among other recurrent features the stolen exam paper, the innocent who is wrongly accused and ultimately justified after much proud suffering, the boating accident, the group rivalries, the noble friendships. Adult characters are largely stereotypes: a headmaster known as \\"the Doctor\\" and modelled on Thomas Arnold of Rugby, \\"the jabbering French master (pointed beard and two-tone shoes)\\", the popular games master, the dry pedant, the generally comic domestic staff.Quigly, pp. 27 and 87 Reed established a tradition in which the fictional boarding school was peopled by such characters and was almost invariably represented in terms of \\"dark passages, iron bedsteads, scratched desks, chill dormitories and cosy, shabby studies\\".Quigly, p. 88 Quigly suggests that one reason for the success of Reed's stories and their long-lasting appeal is that they are not so much books about school as books about people.Quigly, p. 80 John Sime of the RTS, in a memorial tribute to Reed after his death, notes that the boys in the stories are recognisably of flesh and blood, with \\"just that spice of wickedness ... without which a boy is not a boy\\".Sime, pp. vii‚Äìviii Personal life and other activities Lough Swilly, County Donegal, Ireland, the annual holiday destination for the Reed family In 1876 Reed married Elizabeth Greer, the daughter of Samuel MacCurdy Greer, a County Court judge and former MP for the County of Londonderry in the north of Ireland. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy, but three healthy children followed: Charles in 1879, Margaret in 1882 and Talbot in 1886.Morison, p. 23 The connection with Ireland was of great value to Reed, and the family regularly spent annual holidays on the shores of Lough Swilly in County Donegal.Sime, pp. xvi‚Äìxvii Reed was constantly busy; he held the \\"loafer\\"‚Äîdefined by him as \\"anyone who worked from nine to five and did nothing with the rest of the day\\"‚Äîin contempt. Alongside his heavy schedule of duties at the foundry and his prolific writing, he took his share in the supervision of the various charities founded by his grandfather Andrew Reed, and was a deacon at his local Congregational Church. In 1892 he was a co-founder of the Bibliographical Society and its first honorary secretary, an office he modestly agreed to hold \\"pro tem in the hopes of your finding a better man\\".Morison, pp. 66‚Äì70 Physically active and energetic, Reed keenly followed his old school's fortunes on the sports field, on one occasion writing anxiously to the school about its apparent loss of enthusiasm for football and cricket. As part of a busy social life he regularly attended City of London Old Boys' reunion dinners, and was a member of two London clubs, the Savile and the Reform. In politics Reed was a Liberal, although he disagreed with Gladstone's Irish Home Rule policy.Sime, pp. xii and xxi His busy and fulfilling life was punctuated from time to time by private tragedies. The loss of his baby daughter was followed, soon after, by the death of his younger brother Kenneth, drowned with a companion in Lough Allen in County Leitrim, while exploring the River Shannon. In 1883 his elder brother, The Rev. Charles Reed, \\"my 'father confessor' in times of all trouble\\", died after a fall during a walking holiday in Switzerland.Sime, pp. xvii‚Äìxviii Death and legacy Reed's memorial stone in Abney Park cemetery Reed generally enjoyed vigorous good health. However, early in 1893 there were signs that his workload was taking its toll. In January of that year he left London for an extended stay in Ireland, hoping to recover his energies. He returned to his various duties in May, but later in the summer became seriously ill with what was identified at the time as \\"consumption\\", and was probably pulmonary tuberculosis.Morison, pp. 70‚Äì71Cox, pp. 46‚Äì47 He relinquished the secretaryship of the Bibliographical Society and returned to Ireland where, though largely confined indoors, he continued writing his regular weekly column for the Leeds Mercury and finished his final novel, Kilgorman. Letters to friends at home indicated that he remained in good spirits and was hopeful of recovery.Sime, pp. xxii‚Äìxxiii However, his condition worsened, and he was advised to return home for urgent medical treatment. Back in London he wrote his last piece for the Mercury, a review of Seventy Years of Irish Life by W.R. Le Fanu. He died at his home in Highgate on 28 November 1893, aged 41, and was buried in Abney Park Cemetery, by the side of his father and grandfather.Morison, p. 72 Among the many tributes paid to Reed, Joseph Sime spoke for \\"the boys of the English-speaking world\\" who had \\"lost one of their best friends\\". Sime wrote of Reed's particular empathy with the young: \\"He possessed in himself the healthy freshness of heart of boyhood ... and could place himself sympathetically at the boy's standpoint in life.\\" Reed's grave was visited by boys and their families for many years. He died a wealthy man, although long before his death he had transferred the copyright of his books to the Religious Tract Society for a nominal sum.Morison, p. 31 Reed's regular readers included the young P.G. Wodehouse, who particularly loved the school stories.Donaldson, p. 66 Wodehouse's literary biographer Benny Green, while excoriating Reed as a \\"hereditary prig\\" and a \\"religious huckster\\", accepts that he influenced Wodehouse, and cites in particular The Willoughby Captains. Green also echoes Quigly in asserting that none of Reed's successors could match his abilities as a storyteller.Green, pp. 15‚Äì17 Quigly summarises Reed's legacy to future school story writers: he established a genre by \\"alter[ing] the shapeless, long-winded, garrulous and moralistic school story\\" into something popular and readable, a convention followed by all his successors.Quigly, pp. 82‚Äì83 Reed himself expressed the guiding principles of his life in a letter addressed to a new Boys' Club in Manchester: \\"The strong fellows should look after the weak, the active must look after the lazy, the merry must cheer up the dull, the sharp must lend a helping hand to the duffer. Pull together in all your learning, playing and praying.\\" The grave in Abney Park was eventually surmounted by a memorial stone for Reed's family in the style of a Celtic cross, reflecting their connections to Ireland. It was cut by the O'Shea brothers' firm. Reed's biographer, the printing executive and historian Stanley Morison, suggests that Reed's legacy is his History of the Old English Letter Foundries, while Jack Cox, historian of the B.O.P, asserts that the school stories first serialised in the magazine are the writer's true memorial.Cox, p. 47 After Reed's death, Elizabeth Reed agreed that his considerable personal library should be given to the St Bride Foundation Institute, whose collection of typographic literature included the library of Reed's early mentor, William Blades.Morison, p. 73 This collection now forms part of the St Bride Library, The books and collection of Reed's company, the Fann Street Foundry, went to first its later purchaser Stephenson Blake and then to the Type Museum collection. Bibliography This does not include Reed's uncollected short stories, journalism or trade publications. All the school stories, and much of the other fiction, first appeared in The Boy's Own Paper.

It was one of the first projects by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, as attested in his monograph I quattro libri dell'architettura. The work was commissioned by the brothers Girolamo, Pietro and Marcantonio Godi, started in 1537 and concluded in 1542, with later modifications to the rear entry and gardens. The villa has been designated by UNESCO as part of the World Heritage Site \\"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\\". The villa and extensive gardens are open to the public in the afternoon, year round. The building also houses a museum of archeology in the basement, with hundreds of fossils of plant and animal life in the region. Its large park was laid out in the 19th century and was used as a film location for Senso. Architecture  The building lacks of ornamentation usually associated with Palladio's mature work, and for the refined, symmetrical proportions of the fa√ßade and massing of the structure. The plan is arranged with suites of apartments arranged symmetrically on each side of the main sala and a recessed entry loggia. The plan published in I quattro libri dell'architettura twenty- eight years after the building's completion is probably a revision of Palladio's original design and includes an extensive complex of farm buildings, which are not part of the actual realisation. This early work by Palladio still demonstrates characteristics of the architecture of his time. A harmonic unity of landscape and architecture does not yet seem to have been an aspiration. The building is a massive block consisting of three distinct parts. The public space of the reception area (the sala) is clearly distinguished from the domestic living areas and the ensemble does not present a unified appearance. The flight of entrance steps is flanked by balusters and its width corresponds to the middle arch of the arcade of the loggia.

Their \\"Hall of the Muses\\" includes depictions of caryatids within a composition of muses and poets in Arcadian landscapes. Ruins of a Greek temple also form the backdrop for the depiction of Olympian gods. This is followed by symbols of peace and justice, a common theme in Venetian villas following the War of the League of Cambrai and the desire for a new Pax Venetiana, or great peace within the Republic of Venice.

The band moved through many different musical styles since its inception, weaving together at various times shoegazer, Heavy Metal, gothic rock, post-punk, prog-rock, industrial, and post-rock influences; while at the same time working in tribal, experimental, ambient and ethereal atmospheres. The most common lyrical themes had to do with spirituality, relationships with others (human as well as paranormal or divine), paranoia, power, and control. Biography Apse was formed in 1999 in Newtown, Connecticut by high school friends Robert Toher (guitar), Ezer Lichtenstein (drums), and Ryan Todd (bass) as an instrumental, experimental ambient rock group . After the group recorded its first EP in 2001, friend Aaron Piccirillo joined as an additional guitarist. This lineup recorded several more EPs, and eventually Toher's vocals entered the mix. In the spring of 2003, friend Michael Gundlach (guitar) joined the band. The band's gigs were often performed in low light with the members seated, surrounded by antique electronic equipment. By the end of 2004, Apse was signed to Acuarela Discos, based in Madrid, Spain. Apse (a self-titled, 34 minute EP), was released internationally in the spring of 2005. A second drummer, Matthew Wick, was added to the band for live performances during this period. The group underwent another lineup change in the late summer of 2005, when Todd and Wick left the band; Piccirillo switched to bass, and Albert Gray recruited to play guitar. With this lineup, their tribal and darkly atmospheric debut album, Spirit, was recorded, and was released internationally on November 21, 2006. The group toured Europe in support of it that fall, most notably appearing at the Tanned Tin festival in Castellon, Spain . Gray and Piccirillo left the band in early 2007, and friends Austin Stawiarz (guitar) and John Mordecai (bass) were taken on as new members for that year's European tours, which included a stop at Belgium's Pukkelpop festival. Toher and Gundlach relocated to Cape Cod, Mass., later that year, and by January 2008, creative and personal differences led to Lichtenstein and Stawiarz parting ways with the group. Brandon Collins (drums) and Jed Armour (guitar) joined the band, and Piccirillo rejoined soon after as a keyboardist/guitarist/percussionist for that spring's European tour. The band made its UK debut on that tour at the ATP v. Pitchfork Festival in Camber Sands, England, and would go on to play several more ATP festivals in the UK and US over the next two years. A re-release of Spirit with alternate packaging and a bonus track (a version of the Eras track \\"Ark,\\" which here features an alternate ending) was released on London-based ATP Recordings in July (UK) and August (US), 2008. An album titled Eras was released in a limited run of 425 vinyl copies on Feb. 14, 2009, on Equation Records. Recorded during 2007 (various production issues delayed its release), it primarily features songs written by Toher and Lichtenstein, with an individual track each from Piccirillo and Gundlach. Eras, while similar to Spirit for its dark, experimental nature, ambient passages and heavy rhythms, marked the beginning of a stylistic shift, particularly for the occasional use of major- key chords and overall shorter song lengths. The album notably features performances from almost all of Apse's former and current members (as of 2007). There are no plans to officially release the album in any other format, but with few remaining physical copies, the band is offering it as a free download on its official site. Numerous new songs for the follow-up to Spirit were written, demoed, performed and discarded since 2007. Recording commenced in autumn of 2008 and continued through the spring. The album, Climb Up, was finally released Oct. 20, 2009 in the UK and Nov. 10 in the US on ATP Recordings. The album marked another departure for the band; the songs are noticeably less dark, shorter, and sometimes adhere to more common rock song structures. Members have attributed the change in sound to the long time spent touring for Spirit, after which a stark contrast to the dark atmospheres was desired. The album was featured in Under the Radar magazine's Best Albums of 2009 list at No. 25\\\\. By the time of its release, Piccirillo was no longer a member of the group, though he was present for the initial writing process and is thus credited with co-writing several songs on the album (\\"Rook,\\" \\"The Age,\\" and \\"The Whip\\"). In 2009, the band added Daniel Sobo as a touring keyboardist/auxiliary musician for tours and live performances through 2010. Sobo, a longtime friend, produced one of the band's early EPs. The group disbanded in early 2011, with some members moving on to form the band ERAAS.

Military career Shwe Mann graduated from the Defence Services Academy, Intake 11, Pyin Oo Lwin in 1969. He quickly rose through the ranks, and became major in 1986. He served as a Regiment Commander in Karen State and earned the honorific title Thura (brave hero) for his military campaign against the Karen National Liberation Army in 1988. The campaign led to the eventual capture of the Karen National Union (KNU)‚Äôs headquarters in the Methawaw Area. He served as a tactical operations commander for Light Infantry Division (LID) 66 based in Prome from 1993 to 1995. His achievements in the Karen state in 1994 meant that he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He was commander of the elite LID 11 based in Inn Daing, near Yangon in 1996.

In line with the SPDC‚Äôs developmental rhetoric, he supported a number of initiatives aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and food security. These included supporting seasonal crop rotation, and converting more than 1 million acres of low, dry and wetlands into cultivated land. This was possible thanks to improvements in water channelisation and river banks. 500,000 acres of intensive and extensive fishery farms were also created. He was promoted to Joint Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in 2001. That same year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general. He became Chief of General Staff of the Armed Services in 2003. As a key figure in the SPDC, he seems to have overseen a number of offensives against ethnic insurgents.

Relationship with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi Despite their opposite political standpoints, the relationship between Shwe Mann and Aung San Suu Kyi has been defined as ‚Äúexcellent.‚Äù Others have defined it as ‚Äúa working relationship, albeit perhaps one of convenience.‚Äù They have maintained an open stance on a possible future alliance.\\"Myanmar‚Äôs Suu Kyi Praises ‚ÄòCooperative Spirit‚Äô of Key Rival\\", Mediacorp News Group Channel NewsAsia, 7 May 2015.

However, he has also stressed that the problem has been on-going for at least the last 100 years. In his conference at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, he pointed out that the ongoing violence in Rakhine State is not only between religious groups, but also between mobs. Shwe Mann has assumed a liberal- conservative position on federalism. He has claimed he would rather see an evolution of the federal system rather than its revolution. Education Shwe Mann has spoken about the need to strengthen the current education system in Myanmar. He has argued that Myanmar education is ‚Äúnot in line with what [is] need today.‚Äù He has also spoken in favour of a National Educational Bill to improve basic and secondary education, including universities and vocational schools. Stance on the international community Shwe Mann has made it known that the country‚Äôs future development depends on the ‚Äúeconomic cooperation [between] the private sector and the international community.‚Äù Speaking at The Asian Foundation, he praised the non-profit sector and NGOs, who work ‚Äúnot for an individual country but for the international community.‚Äù Relationship with the U.S. Shwe Mann has been seen as a key figure in the ongoing diplomatic effort to recalibrating Washington‚Äôs foreign policy towards Asia, known as \\"pivot.\\" Indeed, the U.S. President sought his company during his first official visit to Myanmar. Jim Della-Giacoma, Southeast Asia analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG), argued that the U.S. had made a common cause with Shwe Mann to \\"bringing the national parliament to life as a legitimate democratic institution.\\" Oppositely, a U.S. State Department cable published by WikiLeaks in March 2007 was titled \\"Shwe Mann, Burma's Dictator-in-Waiting,\\" and described him as an ambitious politician. Shwe Mann has argued in favour of increased U.S. investment and technical support in Myanmar. Relationship with China Shwe Mann visited China before his 2015 official visit to the U.S. He has stressed that Myanmar and China are good neighbours and entertain friendly diplomatic relations. At the same time, he has called for greater transparency and accountability on Chinese investments. ASEAN Shwe Mann has emphasised the need to integrate Myanmar into the global economy. \\"In the globalised economy, no country or region can stand alone. The development of one region depends on integration with other regions in the world,\\" he stated in an official press release.\\"Statement by Rt. Honourable Thura U Shwe Mann, Speaker of Pyidaungsu Hluttaw and Pyithu Hluttaw, at the Eighth Asia-Europe Parliamentary Partnership Meeting (ASEP-8)\\" Pyithu Hluttaw, 2012. Retrieved 30 May 2015.

India and North Korea Whilst still in the military, Shwe Mann travelled to India and North Korea to sign military cooperation agreements with the two countries. In the 2000s, he tried to forge closer ties with India, which he visited to appeal for more armaments in 2006. In November 2008, Shwe Mann travelled to North Korea and signed a memorandum of understanding on military cooperation. In an interview, he said that the Burmese counterpart \\"studied their air defence system, weapons factories, aircrafts and ships.\\" Personal life Shwe Mann, a Burmese Buddhist, was born on 11 July 1947 in Kanyuntkwin, Bago Division, to father Pho Phay, and mother Htay Yi. He is married to Khin Lay Thet, a former high school teacher. In a 2007-dated U.S. cable, she was recorded as a member of the Panel of Patrons and one of four vice presidents of the Myanmar Women‚Äôs Affairs Federation.

Cohen, he has \\"taken concrete steps to promote political reforms and human rights, and to move Burma away from repression and dictatorship toward democracy and freedom\\".\\"Treasury Department Lifts Sanctions Against Burma‚Äôs President and Lower House Speaker\\", U.S. Department of the Treasury, 19 September 2012.

Aung Thet Mann Aung Thet Mann is the Chief Executive officer at Ayer Shwe Wah, which became the first private company allowed to export rice to Bangladesh and Singapore in 2005. The company is part of Burmese tycoon Tay Za‚Äôs Htoo Group of Companies. When Shwe Mann was Regional Commander in the Ayeyarwady Division, Ayer Shwe Wah received lucrative government contracts to supply fertilizers to farmers throughout the delta. The company also received 30,000 acres of land for development under the government‚Äôs Lowland Development Program. These have since been returned with all dues and taxes paid for. Ayer Shwe Wah has also been involved in construction projects in Naypyidaw. Toe Naing Mann Toe Naing Mann is the founder of Red Link Communications, a major Burmese telecommunications group. In 2004, Toe Naing Mann married Zay Zin Latt, daughter of Khin Shwe, who is the president of Zaygabar Co. Ltd. and a leading Rangoon real estate mogul.

(died sometime between 854 and 864) succeeded his brother Aznar S√°nchez as count of Vasconia Citerior (Gascony) in 836, in spite of the objections of King Pepin I of Aquitaine. After Pepin's death in 838, confusion enveloped southern Gaul. Most Aquitainian counts elected Pepin II as their king, but Emperor Louis the Pious, urged by his wife Judith, redivided his vast realm at Worms in May 839, granting all of Aquitaine, Gascony, Septimania, and the Hispanic March to his youngest son, Charles the Bald. Louis sent an imperial army into the Limousin and then installed his son at Poitiers. The partisans of Pepin were defeated and Louis proceeded to appoint new counts in new districts. One Seguin was appointed in Bordeaux to counter Sancho, now acting virtually alone. Seguin was appointed dux Wasconum by Louis the Pious--that is, duke of the march guarding the frontier with the Gascons, led by Sancho, most probably a Basque himself. Seguin was killed later that year in a battle against the Vikings. In 848, Bordeaux was left without a leader after the withdrawal of the Vikings. It is not known for sure if Sancho took possession of the city, but it is certainly possible. Historian Ferdinand Lot supposed that Sancho was even nominated as duke at Limoges or Orl√©ans by Charles the Bald in that year.Higounet, 39 n57. He certainly submitted by 850.Lewis, 98. With his brother-in-law Emenon, Count of P√©rigord, the husband of his sister Sancha, Sancho was captured by the dissident Moorish chieftain Musa. Charles negotiated their release and in turn Sancho handed over Pepin II when the latter took refuge in Gascony in September 852.Higounet, 39. The chronology here is confused and the chief Moorish offensive should probably be dated to 856, leaving open the sequence and veracity of the related event. In or before 864, Sancho died and the duchy of Gascony passed to his nephew Arnold, son of Emenon. The later duke Garc√≠a S√°nchez may have been his son.  Notes Sources Primary *Pertz, G, ed.

Life According to his Vita, written by Braulius, bishop of Caesaraugusta (modern Zaragoza) roughly a hundred years after the saint's death, Emilianus was born in Vergaja,Monks of Ramsgate. \\"Aemilian\\". Book of Saints, 1921 CatholicSaints.Info. 26 November 2016 which is identified with Berceo in La Rioja, where he was a shepherd. Emilian had a religious experience, perhaps around the age of twenty, which led him to decide to dedicate himself to God's service. He sought out an experienced hermit in Bilibio,\\"Bilibio, tambi√©n conocido como Haro la Vieja, fue una aldea situada en la falda norte de los Riscos de Bilibio, donde el r√≠o Ebro entra en La Rioja por el lugar de Las Conchas, municipio de Haro.\\" (Paloma Torrijos, \\"Historia y Genealog√¨a\\") Felix (more usually known by the Spanish form of his common name, San Felices), where Emilianus lived for a number of years. After leaving his teacher, Emilianus lived as a hermit (perhaps even a gyrovagus) in the mountains or on the historic Roman road which became the Camino de Santiago. Didymus the Bishop of Tarazona ordained Emilianus and appointed him parish priest of Vergaja. However, Emilianus aroused the opposition of his fellow priests because of his heavy distribution of alms or reputation for holiness or miracleworking. Emilianus returned to the wilderness, and a small community of disciples gathered around his cell. He died at a venerable age, and his body, was initially interred at his hermitage, but later transferred to a monastery built in memory of him. Veneration Braulius also recorded miracles that occurred after Aemilian's death, but the fame of the San Mill√°n de la Cogolla monastery dedicated in his memory (and which held his tomb) eclipsed that of its founder. San Mill√°n de Suso monastery is known for its Mozarabic architecture, and its growing popularity during the heyday of the pilgrimage rout led to its expansion in the eleventh century with San Mill√°n de Yuso (the communities however having separate abbots until the 12th century). The longstanding monastic community (Benedictine by the mid-medieval era) is credited with one of the oldest books written in the Spanish language, the Vida de San Mill√°n de la Cogolla (biography by Gonzalo de Berceo). St. Dominic of Silos (the miracleworker for whom Saint Dominic was named) also received his education and began his religious career at San Millan monastery. He is a patron saint of La Rioja; the longer name of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla refers to the monastic cowl. Because of the monastery's role on the traditional pilgrimage route, representations of Emilianus can be mixed with that of Saint James the Moor-slayer, such as a Benedictine on horseback with a banner and sword.

T. Meade was the pseudonym of Elizabeth Thomasina Meade Smith (1844‚Äì1914), a prolific writer of girls' stories. She was born in Bandon, County Cork, Ireland, daughter of Rev. R. T. Meade, of Nohoval, County Cork.Stephen Brown: A Reader's Guide to Irish Fiction (1910) She later moved to London, where she married Alfred Toulmin Smith in September 1879. She began writing at 17 and produced over 300 books in her lifetime, being so prolific that no fewer than eleven new titles under her byline appeared in the first few years after her death. She was primarily known for her books for young people, of which the most famous was A World of Girls, published in 1886. However, she also wrote \\"sentimental\\" and \\"sensational\\" stories, religious stories, historical novels, adventure, romances, and mysteries, including several with male co-authors. The first of these was Dr. Clifford Halifax, with whom she first collaborated in 1893 and wrote six books. A year later she first teamed with Robert Eustace, and turned out eleven volumes with him. Her last co-author was Sir Robert Kennaway Douglas (her daughter's father-in-law); they produced only one book, in 1897. The Eustace partnerships are notable for two female villains, Madame Sara (in The Sorceress of the Strand) and Madame Koluchy (the mastermind of a band of gangsters, in The Brotherhood of the Seven Kings). Meade and Eustace also created the occult detective and palmist Diana Marburg (\\"the Oracle of Maddox Street\\"), who first appeared in the US edition of Pearson's Magazine in 1902. One of her most unusual titles is Dumps; A Plain Girl (1905). She was also the editor of a popular girls' magazine, Atalanta. Meade was a feminist and a member of the Pioneer Club. Following the death of women's-rights pioneer and Pioneer Club founder Emily Langton Massingberd (1847‚Äì1897), Meade wrote a novel in 1898 based on her life titled The Cleverest Woman in England.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/gunby-estate-hall- and-gardens/features/women-and-power-emily-massingberd Whitney Standlee, Power to Observe: Irish Women Novelists in Britain, 1890-1916.

It is similar to the related S. luteus, but can be distinguished by its ringless stalk. Like S. luteus, it is an edible mushroom that often grows in a symbiosis (mycorrhiza) with pine. It has been commonly known as the weeping bolete, or the granulated bolete. Previously thought to exist in North America, that species has now been confirmed to be the rediscovered Suillus weaverae. Taxonomy Suillus granulatus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as a species of Boletus. It was given its current name by French naturalist Henri Fran√ßois Anne de Roussel when he transferred it to Suillus in 1796. Suillus is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from the word \\"swine\\". Granulatus means \\"grainy\\" and refers to the glandular dots on the upper part of the stem. However in some specimens the glandular dots may be inconspicuous and not darkening with age; thus the name S. lactifluus, \\"oozing milk\\" was formerly applied to this form as it is not notably characterized by glandular dots. Description Suillus granulatus showing 'milky droplets' on pores. The orange-brown, to brown-yellow cap is viscid (sticky) when wet, and shiny when dry, and is usually 3 to 9 cm in diameter. The stem is pale yellow, of uniform thickness, with tiny brownish granules at the apex. It is without a ring. The tubes and pores are small, pale yellow, and exude pale milky droplets when young. The flesh is also pale yellow. Suillus granulatus is often confused with Suillus luteus, which is another common and widely distributed species occurring in the same habitat. S. luteus has conspicuous a partial veil and ring, and lacks the milky droplets on the pores. Also similar is Suillus brevipes, which has a short stipe in relation to the cap, and which does not ooze droplets from the pore surface.  Bioleaching  Bioleaching is the industrial process of using living organisms to extract metals from ores, typically where there is only a trace amount of the metal to be extracted. It has been found that Suillus granulatus can extract trace elements (Titanium, Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium and Lead) from wood ash and apatite. Distribution and habitat Grows with Pinus (pine trees) on both calcareous and acid soils, and sometimes occurs in large numbers. Suillus granulatus is the most widespread pine-associating Suillus species in warm climates. It is common in Britain, Europe. It is associated with Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) in South Korea. A native to the Northern Hemisphere, the fungus has been introduced into Australia under Pinus radiata. It is also found in Africa, New Zealand, Hawaii, Argentina and southern Chile. Edibility Suillus granulatus is edible and good. Like all Suillus species, the tubes are best removed before cooking. It is sometimes included in commercially produced mushroom preserves. Has been known to cause mild stomach upsets. The fruit bodies‚Äîlow in fat, high in fiber and carbohydrates, and a source of nutraceutical compounds‚Äîcan be considered a functional food. Toxicity Suillus granulatus sometimes causes contact dermatitis to those who handle it.

They are perhaps best known for creating original dance singles as well as dance remixes for artists such as iiO, Moby, New Order, Rosko and Sin√©ad O'Connor.  Early life and careers  John Creamer grew up in Philadelphia and began his career in New York in the mid-90s as an A&R; man for Eightball Records, and later for Satellite Records, and was producing acid house before he met up with his future production partner. Stephane K came to New York by way of Tokyo and Paris, and was making music with Satoshi Tomiie under the name \\"Bipath\\" when he met Creamer. Both artists were formerly musicians, with Creamer playing trombone in a ska band in Philly, and K playing bass guitar in an alternative rock band in Tokyo, and both artists have claimed in interviews that they were converted to house music at the legendary New York nightclub, Sound Factory. They paired up as a production team in 1998, and also perform live around the world as DJs, both separately and together as a duo.  Early 2000s ‚Äì breakthrough years  In 2002, they were named \\"Remixers of the Year\\" by Remix Magazine. Their careers reached new heights that year when they were chosen by John Digweed to mix the 4th volume of his acclaimed \\"Bedrock\\" mixed compilation series.

D. Patel. To distinguish between the two, he was generally referred to as R.D. A member of parliament from 1966 until 1976, he was Speaker of the House of Representatives between 1972 and 1976. Early life R.D. Patel was born in the Kheda district of Gujarat in India. He arrived in Fiji after his brother had established his law practice in Nadi. Like his brother, he was a lawyer and worked together with him before establishing his own law practice in Ba. Political career In the elections for the expanded Legislative Council in 1966, he was nominated for the Ba Indian Constituency. This was the most marginal seat in the 1963 election, in which Sidiq Koya had managed to defeat James Shankar Singh by only 518 votes. With the redrawing of the constituency's boundaries, the seat had become even harder for the Federation Party (NFP) to win, but after a hard campaign, R.D. Patel defeated James Shankar Singh by only 293 votes. He increased his majority in the 1968 by-election to 2000. Rivalry with Sidiq Koya After the death of A.D. Patel in 1969, R.D. was touted as the next leader but the party chose Sidiq Koya instead. There was dissatisfaction within the National Federation Party with the concessions made by Koya to facilitate Fiji's independence, so after the 1972 election, when R.D. Patel was made the Speaker of the House of Representatives, many assumed that it was an attempt by Koya to get R.D. out of his way. While he was Speaker, he did not refrain from making public comments regarding the way Sidiq Koya was conducting his duties as leader of the NFP. His term as Speaker was not without controversy, and when he adjourned Parliament to delay debate on a Bill that his party opposed, a vote of no-confidence was held on him in May 1973, passing by 21 votes to 15. However, with the constitution requiring a two-thirds majority for a Speaker to be removed from office, he remained in the chair.Immovable Pacific Islands Monthly, June 1973, p12 He later resigned as Speaker in 1976, only to become embroiled in the emerging conflict within the NFP. Differences within NFP were patched up for the elections held in March 1977, but R. D. Patel stood against Sidiq Koya as an independent candidate. Although he lost the election, he won a significant number of votes and \\"softened\\" Sidiq Koya for the first defeat of his political career six months later in the September elections. R.D. Patel became the de facto leader of the Gujarati community in Fiji after his brother's death and he spent the rest of his life in community service, in particular with the Gujarat Education Society of Fiji.

The composition is considered to be important in the development of jazz.Magee, Jeffrey. \\"'King Porter Stomp' and the Jazz Tradition\\", p.46, Current Musicology, 71-73 (Spring 2001-Spring 2002), p. 22-53. It became a hit during the swing era, when it was recorded by Benny Goodman. History According to Jelly Roll Morton, the tune was composed in 1906 and was the first \\"stomp\\" in the history of jazz. Morton first recorded the number in 1923 as a piano solo, but did not file a copyright on the tune until 1924. That year, Morton recorded a duet version with Joe \\"King\\" Oliver on cornet. Morton said that he had actually written the tune almost 20 years earlier, and that it was named after his friend and fellow pianist Porter King. On July 1, 1935, Benny Goodman and his orchestra recorded Fletcher Henderson's arrangement of the number, backed with \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\". It was released July 31 as Victor 25090, and became a sizeable hit and a standard of the big band era. Goodman's recording featured the well known trumpeter of the day Bunny Berigan. Fletcher Henderson had recorded his own arrangement several times with his own band during the 1920s and early 1930s. Harry James recorded a version in 1939 on Brunswick 8366. Other big bands also recorded the tune, as did more traditional jazz groups. Late 1960s \\"space-age\\" bandleader Pat Williams recorded the song on his 1968 Verve LP Shades of Today. In 1975, Gil Evans and his orchestra arranged a new cover in There Comes a Time album, with Tony Williams, David Sanborn and George Adams among others. The American jazz trio Air recorded the tune for their 1979 album Air Lore.

A native of northern California, Owen played both baseball and football at Santa Clara University. He made his Major League Baseball debut in 1931, but spent the 1932 season in the International League where he was named the league's Most Valuable Player. He returned to the Tigers in 1933, became part of Detroit's \\"Battalion of Death\\" infield, and remained the team's starting third baseman from 1933 to 1937. He had his best season in 1934 when he compiled a .317 batting average with 98 RBIs. He was involved in a fight with Joe Medwick during the final game of the 1934 World Series that led to a near riot and Medwick's ejection from the game. In December 1937, Owen was traded to the Chicago White Sox where he played in 1938 and 1939 and compiled a career-high 305 assists in 1938. In December 1939, he was sold to the Boston Red Sox where he concluded his major league career during the 1940 season. During his nine-year career in Major League Baseball, Owen compiled a .275 batting average and .339 on-base percentage, appeared in 1,011 games, and totaled 1,388 total bases, 1,040 hits, 499 RBIs, 474 runs scored, 338 bases on balls, and 242 extra base hits. Owen later served as a minor league manager for 11 years for the Portland Beavers (1944‚Äì1946), San Jose Red Sox (1947‚Äì1951), Davenport Tigers (1952), Durham Bulls (1953), and Valdosta Tigers (1954). He was also a scout for the Detroit Tigers until retiring in the 1970s. Early years Owen was born in Agnew, California (now part of Santa Clara), and attended Bellarmine College Preparatory. He then attended Santa Clara University where he played for the Broncos baseball and football teams. In his senior year at Santa Clara, he was declared ineligible to play baseball as he had signed an optional contract to play professional baseball for the Seattle Indians. Instead, he served as the coach of the Santa Clara baseball team during his senior year. Playing career Seattle Indians (1930 season) Owen began his professional baseball career in 1930 with the Seattle Indians of the Pacific Coast League. He appeared in 138 games and compiled a .300 batting average with 24 doubles and seven triples. Detroit Tigers (1931 season) Prior to the 1931 season, Owen was purchased by the Detroit Tigers from the Seattle Indians. Tigers manager Bucky Harris rated Owen as \\"the greatest prospect the American League has seen in many years.\\" During the 1931 season, Owen appeared in 105 games, 37 as the team's starting shortstop, 34 as the third baseman, and 21 as the second baseman. Newark Bears (1932 season) After batting only .223 with the Tigers in 1931, Owen returned to the minors. He split the 1932 season in the International League with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Newark Bears. In October 1932, he hit a home run to clinch the Little World Series championship for Newark. He was named the Most Valuable Player in the International League for the 1932 season. Detroit Tigers 1933 season In 1933, Owen returned to the Tigers and became the team's starting third baseman. He was part of an infield that became known as the \\"Battalion of Death\\" consisting of Hank Greenberg at first, Charlie Gehringer at second, Billy Rogell at shortstop, and Owen at third. The Battalion of Death remained intact from 1933 to 1935 (until injury sidelined Greenberg in 1936) and was considered one of the best infield combinations in baseball history. Owen appeared in 138 games in 1933, 134 of them as the Tigers' starting third baseman, compiled a .262 batting average, and collected 64 RBIs. 1934 season In 1934, the Tigers' Battalion of Death infield collected 769 hits (214 by Gehringer, 201 by Greenberg, 179 by Owen and 175 by Rogell), 462 RBIs (139 by Greenberg, 127 by Gehringer, 100 by Rogell, and 96 by Owen), and 179 doubles (63 by Greenberg, 50 by Gehringer, 34 by Owen and 32 by Rogell). Three members of the 1934 Tigers infield (Gehringer, Owen and Rogell) played in all 154 games, and the fourth (Greenberg) played in 153. Three members of the 1934 infield finished in the top ten in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award ‚Äì Gehringer second, Greenberg sixth and Owen ninth. Owen also stood out on defense in 1934, turning a career high 33 double plays at third base. He also led the American League's third baseman with 202 putouts. Since 1934, only two major league third basemen (Willie Jones and Eddie Yost) have had more putouts than Owen's 1934 tally. Owen's hands were so large that he was reportedly able to hold and secure seven baseballs in each hand. He was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! with the claim that he \\"can hold 7 baseballs in one hand.\\" The 1934 Tigers won the American League pennant with a 101‚Äì53 record but lost the 1934 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. In Game 7 of the World Series at Navin Field, Joe Medwick of the Cardinals tripled in the sixth inning and knocked Owen down with a hard slide at third. Owen stepped on Medwick, and Medwick, as he lay on the ground, \\"suddenly began lashing out at Owen's legs with his spiked feet.\\" The two players fought, and, when Medwick returned to left field in the bottom of the inning, the Detroit spectators began pelting him with fruit, bottles, and other debris. Sports writer Paul Gallico described the fans as \\"a deadly and vicious mob\\" and added: > \\"The next moment the air was full of flying fruit, apples, oranges, bananas > and beer and pop bottles . . . I watched the crowd and Medwick and the > pelting missiles through my field glasses, and it was a terrifying sight. > Every face in the crowd, women and men was distorted with rage.\\" Eventually, and to prevent a full riot, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered Medwick removed from the game. Interviewed in 1989, Owen recalled, \\"Medwick slid extra hard into me at third base. When he did that, I kicked him in the groin and he didn't like that.\\" 1935 season Prior to the 1935 season, Owen had surgery on his nose and reported sick to spring training. He sustained a strained muscle in spring training and was benched for two weeks in June to allow the injury to heal. Owen appeared in 131 games as the Tigers' starting third baseman in 1935. Despite the injuries, he continued to contribute defensively, ranking third among the American League's third basemen with 19 double plays and a .958 fielding percentage. He helped the Tigers win their second consecutive American League pennant, but his batting average dropped by 54 points to .263. He also compiled poor batting statistics in the post-season with an .069 average in the 1934 World Series and .050 in the 1935 World Series, in which the Tigers defeated the Chicago Cubs in six games. He set a record with 31 consecutive World Series plate appearances without a hit. 1936‚Äì1937 seasons In 1936, Owen had one of his best seasons. He compiled a .295 batting average and a .361 on-base percentage with a career high 105 RBIs. He also led the American League's third basemen with 190 putouts and 28 double plays. In 1937, he missed a portion of the season with a fractured hand, appearing in only 107 games, 102 as the team's starting third baseman. In those appearances, Owen compiled a .288 batting average and a .358 on-base percentage and led the American League third basemen with a .970 fielding percentage. Chicago White Sox (1938‚Äì1939 seasons) In December 1937, Owen was traded by the Tigers with Gee Walker to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Vern Kennedy, Dixie Walker and Tony Piet. During the 1938 season, Owen appeared in 141 games for the White Sox, 139 as the starting third baseman, and compiled a .287 batting average with 35 extra base hits and 55 RBIs. He also collected a career high 305 assists in 1938. In 1939, he appeared in only 58 games, the fewest in his major league career up to that point. Boston Red Sox (1940 season) In December 1939, the White Sox sold Owen to the Boston Red Sox for an undisclosed amount of money. Owen concluded his major league career appearing in 20 games for the Boston Red Sox during the 1940 season. During his nine-year career in Major League Baseball, Owen compiled a .275 batting average and .339 on-base percentage, appeared in 1,011 games, and totaled 1,388 total bases, 1,040 hits, 499 RBIs, 474 runs scored, 338 bases on balls, and 242 extra base hits. Portland Beavers (1941‚Äì1946 seasons) In March 1941, Owen signed with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League. He appeared in 144 games for Portland during the 1941 season. He continued to play for the Beavers through the 1946 season. Managerial career In 1944, Owen took over as the player-manager of the Portland Beavers. In three years as the manager, he compiled records of 87-82 in 1944, 112-68 in 1945, and 74-109 in 1946. In December 1946, Owen signed to manage the San Jose Red Sox in the California State League. He also played for San Jose until an injury led him to announce his retirement as a player in June 1947 at age 41. He continued to manage the San Jose club through the 1951 season. In November 1951, Owen requested and received his release from the San Jose club. In January 1952, he was hired as the manager of the Davenport Tigers in the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League. After one year as manager at Davenport, Owen was hired in January 1953 as the manager of the Durham Bulls. After one year as manager at Durham, Owen served as the manager of the Valdosta Tigers during the 1954 season. Owen later served as a scout, and eventually scouting supervisor, for the Detroit Tigers until he retired in the mid-1970s. Family and death In December 1938, Owen married Violet Walsh, a Detroit public school teacher. Teammate Charlie Gehringer was his best man. They had a son, Skip, in approximately 1944. Owen died in 1991 at age 85 at a nursing home in Mountain View, California, having suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He was buried at the Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s cemetery. A baseball on which Owen gathered the signatures of 11 of the first 12 members of the Baseball Hall of Fame was sold at auction in August 2018 for $623,369. He had preserved the ball inside a fur-lined glove kept in a safe deposit box until his death in 1991.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/24362845/signed-ball- inaugural-hall-fame-inductees-sells-record-price References External links * Category:1906 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Baseball players from California Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Burials at Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Detroit Tigers scouts Category:Durham Bulls managers Category:International League MVP award winners Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Milwaukee Braves scouts Category:Newark Bears (IL) players Category:Portland Beavers managers Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Santa Clara Broncos baseball coaches Category:Seattle Indians players Category:Sportspeople from San Jose, California Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players ","title":"Marv Owen"},{"id":"7074182","text":"Bill Cosby Talks to Kids About Drugs (1971) is an album by Bill Cosby.

In college athletics in the United States, recruiting is the process in which college coaches add prospective student athletes to their roster each off-season. This process typically culminates in a coach extending an athletic scholarship offer to a player who is about to be a junior in high school or higher. There are instances, mostly at lower division universities, where no athletic scholarship can be awarded and where the player pays for tuition, housing, and textbook costs out of pocket or from financial aid. During this recruiting process, schools must comply with rules that define who may be involved in the recruiting process, when recruiting may occur and the conditions under which recruiting may be conducted. Recruiting rules seek, as much as possible, to control intrusions into the lives of prospective student-athletes. The NCAA defines recruiting as ‚Äúany solicitation of prospective student-athletes or their parents by an institutional staff member or by a representative of the institution‚Äôs athletics interests for the purpose of securing a prospective student-athlete‚Äôs enrollment and ultimate participation in the institution‚Äôs intercollegiate athletics program.\\" General process To be considered a ‚Äúrecruited prospective student- athlete‚Äù, athletes must be approached by a college coach or representative about participating in that college's athletic program. NCAA guidelines specify how and when they can be contacted. Letters, telephone calls, and in- person conversations are limited to certain frequency and dates during and after the student's junior year. The NCAA also determines when the athletes can be contacted by dividing the year into four recruiting and non-recruiting periods: 1\\\\. During a contact period, recruiters may make in-person, on- or off-campus contacts and evaluations. Coaches can also write and/or phone athletes during this period. 2\\\\. During an evaluation period, they can only assess academic qualifications and playing abilities. Letters and phone calls are permitted; in-person, off-campus recruiting contacts are not permitted. 3\\\\. During a quiet period, they may make in-person recruiting contacts only on the college campus. Off-campus, recruiters are limited to phone calls and letter-writing. 4\\\\. During a dead period, they cannot make in-person recruiting contacts or evaluations on- or off-campus or permit official/unofficial visits. However, phone calls and letters are permitted. During the recruiting process, the prospective student-athlete goes on an official visit to the school that they're being recruited by. An official visit is a prospective student-athlete's visit to a college campus paid for by the college. The college can pay for transportation to and from the college, room, and meals (three per day) while visiting and reasonable entertainment expenses, including three complimentary admissions to a home athletics contest. NCAA recruiting bylaws limit the number of official visits a recruit may take to five. The NCAA has imposed stringent rules limiting the manner in which competing university-firms may bid for the newest crop of prospective student-athletes. Such rules limit the number of visits, which a student- athlete may make to a given campus, the amount of his expenses that may be covered by the university-firm, and so forth. National Letter of Intent During recruitment, a college coach may ask a prospective player to sign a National Letter of Intent or NLI for short. The NLI is a voluntary program with regard to both institutions and student-athletes. No prospective student- athlete or parent is required to sign the NLI, and no institution is required to join the program. By signing a NLI, a prospective student-athlete agrees to attend the designated college or university for one academic year. Pursuant to the terms of the NLI program, participating institutions agree to provide athletics financial aid to the student-athlete, provided he/she is admitted to the institution and eligible for financial aid under NCAA rules. An important provision of this program serves as a recruiting prohibition applied after a prospective student-athlete signs an NLI This prohibition requires participating institutions to cease recruitment of a prospective student- athlete once an NLI is signed with another institution. The NLI has many advantages to both prospective student-athletes and participating educational institutions: (A) Once a NLI is signed, prospective student-athletes are no longer subject to further recruiting contacts and calls. (B) Student-athletes are assured of an athletics scholarship for a minimum of one full academic year. (C) By emphasizing a commitment to an educational institution, not particular coaches or teams, the program focuses on a prospective student- athlete's educational objectives. In professional sports, the services of athletes are secured via an exclusive contract with an organization. By comparison, the services of many college athletes are secured through recruiting services established by the athletic departments which include staff members and influential friends of the institutions. The college athlete normally signs an exclusive contract, such as the NLI, at the expense of losing a year's eligibility if he chooses to transfer to another institution of his choosing. The NLI program is subscribed to by all major athletic conferences and nearly all-independent universities. NCAA Division I is likely to create its own NLI for each sport and, in addition, designate a different signing date for each sport in order to reduce the time and expense incurred when the recruiting season is overly long. Intercollegiate athletics Recruiting top student-athletes is even more strategic due to the potential increase in undergraduate admissions and booster donations that a championship may bring. Traditionally, coaches recruiting for major college athletic departments focused on highlighting the athletic accomplishments of the athletic program. Clotfelter writes about the problems of college sports. But he says there are benefits to universities in playing big-time sports, which he defines as Division I basketball and schools in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Those benefits go beyond money and can be difficult to measure. The transformation of college athletics over the past 30 years into a multibillion-dollar, internationally recognized business has changed the focus of intercollegiate athletic departments. Budget minded administrators have realized that a winning team can provide an effective means of advertising their institutions and securing much needed additional funding. In order to ensure the cycle of successful seasons, it is imperative that the athletic department recruits the most athletically talented and academically eligible potential student-athletes possible. Since success or failure in recruiting is seen as a precursor of a team's future prospects, many college sports fans follow it as closely as the team's actual games and it also provides a way to be connected to the team during the off season. Fans' desire for information has spawned a million-dollar industry which first developed extensively during the 1980s. Prior to the internet, popular recruiting services used newsletters and pay telephone numbers to disseminate information. Since the mid-1990s, many online recruiting websites have offered fans player profiles, scouting videos, player photos, statistics, interviews, and other information, including rankings of both a player and a team's recruiting class. Most of these websites charge for their information. College football In the United States, the most widely followed recruiting cycle is that of college football. This is due in part to the large following football usually has at most universities in Division I, especially those in the top-level Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Division I FBS football also has the highest number of scholarship players of any college sport, with 85. The NCAA allows football teams to add up to 25 new scholarship players to the roster per academic year, so long as the total number of scholarship players does not exceed 85. For teams in the second-tier Division I FCS, scholarships are limited to an amount equal to 63 full scholarships. However, FCS schools are allowed to award partial scholarships, as long as the total number of \\"counters\\" (NCAA terminology for a person who counts against limits on players receiving financial aid for that sport) is no greater than 85. Effective with the 2017‚Äì18 recruiting cycle, FCS teams are free to award financial aid to any number of new players in a given year, as long as the overall team limits are met; previously, the annual limit on \\"counters\\" had been 30. In Division II, schools are limited to an amount equal to 36 full scholarships. This can be limited due to lack of funding for a schools program. The football recruiting season typically begins as soon as the previous year's class has signed ‚Äî though the building of relationships between college coaches and high school players and their coaches may have been going on for months or years before that. Each summer, high school players attend various football camps at nearby college campuses to be evaluated on measures of athleticism, such as the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, agility shuttle; and the number of repetitions of the bench press that an athlete can perform at a given weight, usually 185 pounds unlike at the NFL combine where they use 225 pounds. Recently, the SPARQ rating has become a popular composite metric of a high school football player's athleticism. At this time of year, based on game film and performance at combines, this is typically when players begin to receive most scholarship offers. After receiving an offer, a player may choose to commit. This is a non-binding, oral agreement. Although more coaches have tried in recent years to get players to commit early, the most highly rated players typically commit within a month of National Signing Day, the day all high school players who will graduate that year can sign letters of intent (LI) to play for the college of their choice. Signing Day always falls on the first Wednesday of February. Other players, who may not have as many offers to choose from, more often verbally commit earlier in the process. Players occasionally decide to sign with a different school from which they gave a verbal commitment, which often leads to rancor between the fans and coaching staffs of the two schools. Junior college players, however, can sign scholarships in late-December, once their sophomore seasons have ended. A letter of intent is binding for both the player and school for one academic year as long as the player is eligible to enroll at the college. In April 2017, the NCAA Division I Council approved a piece of legislation that significantly changed the FBS recruiting landscape. * Effective with the 2017‚Äì18 school year, an early signing period for high school players, to take place in December, was added for the first time. This particular item required the approval of the Collegiate Commissioners Association, which came on May 8. The CCA fixed the early signing period as the first three days of the previously existing midyear signing window for junior college players. * The current limit of 25 new scholarships (or financial aid agreements) per academic year became an absolute limit, eliminating the oversigning phenomenon. The most significant exceptions are for walk-ons who have been on the roster for at least two years, plus current players or recruits who suffer incapacitating injuries. * A new period for official visits, running from April 1 of the recruit's junior year to the Sunday before the last Wednesday in June in the same calendar year, was introduced. This particular change did not take effect until April 1, 2018, meaning that the first recruits able to take advantage of this period were those signing for the 2019 season. * FBS programs are prohibited from hiring designated individuals close to a recruit (such as parents or guardians) during a four-year window centered on the recruit's anticipated (and actual) enrollment at the school, unless they are hired as full-time members of the team's coaching staff. This mirrors a rule that has been in place in D-I men's basketball since 2010. * FBS coaches, as well as any staff members at FBS schools with football-specific responsibilities, are allowed to participate in clinics and camps only for 10 days in June and July, and only if they take place at that school's campus or at an off-campus facility the school regularly uses for practices or games. College basketball Recruiting for Division I basketball teams is also closely followed by fans. Schools are limited to having 13 scholarship players in men's basketball and 15 in women's basketball. The formal NCAA rules and processes for recruiting and signing recruits are similar, but the identification and recruiting of talent differs from football in important ways. Whereas football players can only play in a very limited number of competitive games per year, summer camps and traveling AAU teams afford prospects the opportunity to play outside of the regular basketball season. As a result, while football players generally only come to the attention of college recruiters after excelling at the high school varsity level, top level basketball players may emerge as early as the 8th or 9th grade. Players may also consider their AAU team as their primary squad, which can make high school basketball coaches less influential in the recruiting process than high school football coaches. Another key difference in the recruiting cycle for college basketball, as opposed to that of football (prior to 2017‚Äì18), is the time of signing: * First, basketball, along with most NCAA sports, has two signing periods during which all athletes are allowed to sign letters of intent‚Äîone in the fall (autumn) and the other in the spring. The early signing period starts on the second Wednesday of November and runs through the third Wednesday of that month. Before 2017‚Äì18, football's early signing period (between December and January) was restricted to junior-college transfers. * The regular signing period in basketball does not start until the third Wednesday of April, after high schools throughout the U.S. have completed their basketball seasons. Terminology *Oversigning - is an unofficial term for the practice of American college athletic departments signing recruits to a National Letter of Intent (NLI) that may exceed the maximum number of athletic scholarships permitted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The NCAA limits the total number of scholarships that may be awarded in all sports; in football, it also limits the number of scholarships awarded in a given year. *Quiet period - is a time when the college may not have any in-person talk with the prospective student-athlete or the parents off the college's campus. The coach may not watch the prospect play or practice. The prospective student-athlete can visit college campuses during this time and a coach may write or telephone. *Contact - occurs any time a coach has any face-to-face contact with a prospective student-athlete or the prospect's parents off the college's campus and says more than hello. A contact also occurs if a coach has any contact with the prospective student- athlete or his or her parents at the prospective student-athlete's high school or any location where the prospect is engaging in competition or practice. *Blue chip - A term referring to student athletes that are considered to be among the top players (overall or at their position) coming out of high school. *Yellow chip - The term used for athletes who are good enough to make a college team, but aren't blue chips. *Early enrollment - Enrollment of student athletes to a university during the 2nd semester or 3rd quarter of the academic calendar year that runs concurrent with their final high school calendar year. The student athlete must have completed the secondary education requirements needed to receive his or her diploma, have graduated, met minimum standards for admission and been qualified according to the NCAA clearing house. *Grayshirting - The practice of delaying enrollment of a student athlete until 2nd semester/quarter or 3rd quarter of the academic year following signing of a National Letter of Intent (NLI). Student athletes may be asked to delay enrollment or choose to do so voluntarily for various reasons. If a student athlete is asked to delay entry but chooses not to, that can have their NLI voided and immediately sign with another school without penalty. If a student athlete chooses to grayshirt then they may either be counted toward scholarship limitation for the current signing period or for the signing period of the following year. *Silent commitment - A player has committed to play for a school but has not publicly disclosed this yet. *Verbal commitment - A player has publicly announced a commitment, but has not yet signed the NLI (or a financial aid agreement). Often referred to simply as a \\"verbal\\". *Project/Sleeper/Under the Radar- Terms that refer to a recruit who is not as highly ranked as a school's typical recruits. Often, these are players who may be athletically gifted but who may have begun playing the sport recently, but the coaches believe they may develop into contributing players with more experience. The term can also refer to a recruit who is playing \\"out of position\\" in high school‚Äîthat is, playing at a position for which he may not best be suited in the long term. Sometimes, a player may be limited by his high school system, such as a quarterback with potential as a passer who is playing at a school with a ground-oriented offense. Such a player may also have been hampered by injuries during high school. Schools often recruit such players if they have scholarships left over at the end of a recruiting period. * One-and-done ‚Äì A player likely to declare for a professional draft after one season. While this term can be used in an ice hockey context due to NHL Entry Draft eligibility rules, it is most commonly associated with men's basketball, since current NBA draft rules prevent players from declaring for the draft until one year after high school graduation. Rules in other significant drafts prevent one-and-dones‚Äîwomen's basketball players are not eligible for the WNBA Draft until four years after their high school class has graduated, and the NFL and MLB have three-year restrictions.The NFL and MLB rules differ slightly. Players are not automatically eligible for the NFL Draft until the completion of their college eligibility, but can declare for the draft three years after high school. In the MLB Draft, players are automatically eligible upon high school graduation. However, if they enroll at a four-year institution, they cannot be drafted (or re-drafted) until age 21 or the end of their third year in school, whichever comes first. At that point, eligibility is once again automatic, with no need to declare. * Blow up ‚Äì Verb used to describe the sudden development of a previously-ignored player into a top prospect. Can be used in any sport, but most often connected with basketball. *Athlete - This term mostly applies to American football recruiting. This is typically a student athlete with the skills and physical attributes that would allow them to play numerous positions on the team. *Recruited Walk-On - Student athletes that are invited to join a program but are not offered athletically related financial aid or scholarship. In football, place kickers, punters, and long snappers frequently join teams as recruited walk-ons. Walk-ons may be awarded a scholarship at any time. Once a player is awarded a scholarship, that athlete counts against the scholarship limitations for the duration of the time the student athlete is on scholarship. While many walk-on athletes, particularly in football, are recruited, others may approach the coaches without invitation about joining the team. In some cases, programs may hold open try-outs to find players among the student body. Star Ratings Most recruiting services classify recruits by a number of \\"stars\\" with a higher number for more highly ranked prospects. Most services use 5 stars for the highest ranked recruits and only a few players at each position attain this rank. 4 stars is a typical ranking for most recruits at schools which regularly finish as one of the top ranked teams in a particular sport. 3 stars is a typical ranking for recruits at most other schools in \\"Power Five\\" football conferences. 2 stars is a typical ranking for recruits at most mid-major level or Division I FCS schools. No major recruiting service currently issues ratings below 2 stars; unrated players typically play at levels below NCAA Division I or may be walk-ons at Division I schools.

The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the Bureau of Public Affairs are the sister bureaus.  History  When the Foreign Affairs and Restructuring Act abolished the [United States Information Agency] (USIA) on October 1, 1999, USIA's broadcasting functions were moved to the newly created [Broadcasting Board of Governors] (BBG), and its non-broadcasting information functions were given to the newly created Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. The Bureau of International Information Programs was created out of this restructuring.  Mission and purpose  According to the bureau's page on the Department of State website, IIP \\"provides and supports the places, content, and infrastructure needed for sustained conversations with foreign audiences to build America's reputation abroad\\". Physical and virtual places include over 700 American Spaces around the world, as well as a large social media community that numbers over 12 million followers.

He is most famous for having compiled and commentated the 48-koan collection The Gateless Barrier (Japanese: Mumonkan).Aitken, Robert: The Gateless Barrier: The Wu-men Kuan (Mumonkan. North Point Press, 1990, ) Early life and education Wumen was born in Hangzhou. His first master was Gong Heshang. Wumen received his spiritual education, also called Dharma transmission in Buddhist teaching, in the Linji line (Japanese: Rinzai) of Zen from Zen master Yuelin Shiguan (ÊúàÊûóÂ∏´ËßÄ; Japanese: Gatsurin Shikan) (1143‚Äì1217). Yuelin gave Wumen the koan, a spiritual question, of \\"Zhaozhou‚Äôs dog\\", with which Wu-men struggled for six years before he attained realization. After Yuelin confirmed Wumen‚Äòs understanding of it, Wumen wrote his enlightenment poem: :A thunderclap under the clear blue sky :All beings on earth open their eyes; :Everything under heaven bows together; :Mount Sumeru leaps up and dances. Career In many respects, Wumen was the classical eccentric Zen master. He wandered from temple to temple for many years, wore old and dirty robes, grew his hair and beard long and worked in the temple fields. He was nicknamed \\"Huikai the Lay Monk\\". Wumen compiled and commentated the 48-koan collection The Gateless Barrier when he was the head monk of Longxiang (Wade-Giles: Lung-hsiang; Japanese: Ryusho) monastery. At age 64, he founded Gokoku-ninno temple near West Lake where he hoped to retire quietly, but visitors constantly came looking for instruction.Yamada, Koun (1979) Gateless Gate: newly translated with commentary by zen master Koun Yamada; Center Publications Work His teachings, as revealed in his comments in Gate of Emptiness, closely followed those of Dahui Zonggao (Â§ßÊÖßÂÆóÊù≤; Wade-Giles: Ta-hui Tsung-kao; Japanese: Daei S≈çk≈ç) (1089‚Äì1163). The importance of \\"Great Doubt\\" was one of his central teaching devices. Wumen said, \\"...[understanding Zen is] just a matter of rousing the mass of doubt throughout your body, day and night, and never letting up.\\" In his comment on Case 1, Zhaozhou's dog, he called mu (ÁÑ°) \\"a red-hot iron ball which you have gulped down and which you try to vomit up, but cannot\\". Wumen believed in blocking all avenues of escape for the student, hence the \\"gateless barrier\\". Whatever activity a student proposed, Wumen rejected: \\"If you follow regulations, keeping the rules, you tie yourself without rope, but if you act any which way without inhibition you're a heretical demon. ... Clear alertness is wearing chains and stocks. Thinking good and bad is hell and heaven. ... Neither progressing nor retreating, you're a dead man with breath. So tell me, ultimately how do you practice?\\" References Further reading * Cleary, Thomas (1993) No Barrier: unlocking the zen koan; Aquarian/Thorsons * Sekida, Katsuki (1995) Two Zen Classics: Mumonkan and Hekiganroku; Weatherhill External links * Category:1183 births Category:1260 deaths Category:Chan Buddhist monks Category:Chinese spiritual writers Category:Chinese Zen Buddhists Category:Rinzai Buddhists Category:Song dynasty Buddhist monks Category:Song dynasty writers Category:Writers from Hangzhou ","title":"Wumen Huikai"},{"id":"7074251","title":"Andy LaVerne"},{"id":"7074291","text":"Tangletown is a neighborhood in the Southwest community of Minneapolis.

Biography Robert Francis Goheen was born on August 15, 1919, to Anne (Ewing) and Dr Robert H. H. Goheen in Vengurla, India, where both his parents were serving as Presbyterian medical missionaries. His early education through the tenth grade was at Kodaikanal International School in Tamil Nadu, South India. After moving to the United States in 1934, he completed his secondary school education at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey in 1936. He then attended Princeton University, where he won the Moses Taylor Pyne Prize and graduated summa cum laude with an A.B. in classics in 1940 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"A Study of the Nature and Object of Tragedy.\\" He was also an avid soccer player. An intelligence officer in the United States Army during World War II, Goheen reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned to Princeton after the war to pursue graduate studies, earning a Ph.D. in classics in 1948 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"The imagery of Sophocles' Antigone (a study of poetic language and structure).\\" Goheen was one of the first four students to receive a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, established at Princeton to encourage war veterans to pursue a career in teaching. In 1942, Goheen married Margaret Skelly. They had four daughters (Anne, Trudi, Megan, and Elizabeth) and two sons (Stephen and Charley), who gave them 18 grandchildren, including the American novelist Megan Crane. Princeton University career Goheen taught classics at Princeton as an assistant professor from 1950 until 1957, when he was appointed the university‚Äôs 16th president. At 37, he was the youngest man to assume that position since the 18th century. Faced with the social and political challenges of the 1960s, Goheen encouraged student involvement in decision-making processes and initiated active recruitment of minorities, as well as overseeing the admission of women in 1969. The New York Times reported after his death: \\"Dr. Goheen would eventually build or acquire 38 buildings, increasing the university‚Äôs indoor square footage by 80 percent. He quadrupled the budget, doubled alumni giving and increased the number of faculty members by 40 percent. ... The university changed fundamentally under Dr. Goheen‚Äôs leadership, going from an establishment cradle to a diversified and complex research university. He attacked the exclusivity of the eating clubs, even opening one to be run by the university. He hired Princeton‚Äôs first black administrator and first black full professor and aggressively recruited promising minority students.\\" Later life After his retirement from Princeton in 1972, he was named president of the Council on Foundations in New York. On January 1, 1977, he became president of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, but that April he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to become United States Ambassador to India. He served in the country of his birth from 1977 to 1980. He returned to Princeton University in 1981, serving on the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He was involved with many activities related to Asia, including a Study Mission to the Philippines in January 1986 sponsored by the Asia Society. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on March 31, 2008.

It was released on September 4, 2006 by Roadrunner Records. It was released in the US by Sensory Records on June 22, 2010. In 2016 the band celebrated their 10th anniversary by re-releasing the album. After the disbandment of the band which had recorded the Amenity demo, the keyboard player and main composer Martijn Westerholt decided to retain lead vocalist Charlotte Wessels and to record an album with the best session musicians available, without the perspective of bringing the songs on tour. He recruited for the project Marco Hietala (Nightwish, Tarot) on vocals and bass, Ad Sluijter (Epica), Guus Eikens (Orphanage) and Jan Yrlund (Imperia) on guitars and Ari√´n van Weesenbeek (God Dethroned) on drums. Guest vocalists on the album were Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation), Liv Kristine (Leaves' Eyes), and George Oosthoek. The album was recorded in different periods during 2005 and 2006 to accommodate the availability of the many musicians involved, often on tour with their bands. Lucidity peaked at No. 43 in Dutch charts and the success of the album pushed Westerholt to reorganize Delain as a touring band with new musicians.

The Orara Way (formerly known as Coramba Road) is the main thoroughfare through the township and is an alternative route between Grafton and Coffs Harbour. Nana Glen is situated between the township of Coramba and Glenreagh.

The schools motto is \\"STRIVE TO ACHIEVE\\". Sports, Recreation and Equestrian Centre Purchased in 1930 by the local community the Sportsground was donated to Council in 1979 on the condition that it be dedicated as a sports and recreation ground for the Nana Glen community. At the time, the ground was in poor condition with no power, water or toilet facilities. A celebration of the town's centenary provided the impetus to clean up the grounds and indeed develop them further. In 1980, a Community Management Committee was formed for the Care and Control of this facility. Since this time, the Committee has overseen the improvements to the Sports Centre with the community, federal, state and local governments and user groups contributing over $2,000,000 for its development. These improvements include erecting an amenities block, extending the Kiosk and amenities, building a dam and providing underground water, and substantial ground improvements including building stockyards, covered yards, cross country jumps and ring fencing.

Galeran was appointed seneschal of the kingdom of Sicily in 1272, where he was unpopular due to his arrogance and partiality.

Galeran was sent to Achaea as Charles' first bailli and vicar-general in that province.* His tenure was not a success. Accustomed to the centralized administration of the kingdom of Sicily, he aroused many complaints from nobles whose feudal rights he traduced, and had difficulty in properly maintaining the troops and equipping the fortresses in Achaea.

He was ethnically Xiongnu and a nephew of the paramount general Erzhu Rong. After Erzhu Rong was killed by Emperor Xiaozhuang, Erzhu Zhao came to prominence by defeating, capturing, and killing Emperor Xiaozhuang. Subsequently, however, his general Gao Huan rebelled against him, defeating him and overthrowing the Erzhu regime in 532, capturing and killing most members of the Erzhu clan. Erzhu Zhao himself tried to hold out, but was again defeated by Gao in 533 and committed suicide.  Under Erzhu Rong's command  Erzhu Zhao was Erzhu Rong's nephew, and when he was young, he was known for his valor, physical strength and expertise in riding and archery, he was said to excel in armed combat so much that he could fight fierce beasts with his bare hands. One of Erzhu Rong's favorite activities as the chief of the Xiongnu Qihu (Â•ëËÉ°) tribe was hunting, and of all his attendants, only Erzhu Zhao was able to keep up with him on hunts. Erzhu Rong therefore favored him greatly. However, once, when Erzhu Rong was asking his commanders for opinions on who could succeed him as the commanding general of the army if he were no longer there, most commanders opined that Erzhu Zhao could, but Erzhu Rong himself opined that Gao Huan was the only one capable of doing so, and he warned Erzhu Zhao, \\"You are no match for Gao Huan, and one day he will surely pierce through your nose.\\" He also commented that Erzhu Zhao would be undefeatable as long as he commanded a cavalry force under 3,000 men‚Äîand that if he commanded more, his army would be in a state of confusion. Later, after Erzhu Rong overthrew Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu, after she poisoned Emperor Xiaoming and made Emperor Xiaozhuang emperor, Erzhu Rong became the paramound general of the empire, and Erzhu Zhao became a major general under him. Emperor Xiaozhuang created him the Duke of Yingchuan. He participated in the campaign by Erzhu Rong's associate Yuan Tianmu (ÂÖÉÂ§©Á©Ü) against the rebel Xing Gao (ÈÇ¢Êù≤) in 529, and subsequently, when Emperor Xiaozhuang was expelled from the capital Luoyang later that year by the competing claimant for the throne, Yuan Hao (who was supported by rival Liang Dynasty), Erzhu Zhao helped break the stalemate between Yuan Hao's troops and Erzhu Rong's troops by making a surprise attack against Yuan Hao's son Yuan Guanshou (ÂÖÉÂÜ†Âèó), causing Yuan Hao's forces to collapse and Yuan Hao to flee, allowing Emperor Xiaozhuang to be restored. By 530, Erzhu Zhao was serving as the governor of Fen Province (Ê±æÂ∑û, roughly modern Linfen, Shanxi), near Erzhu Rong's headquarters at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).  Campaign against Emperor Xiaozhuang  In 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would one day seize the throne, ambushed him in the palace at Luoyang and killed him and Yuan Tianmu. Erzhu Rong's wife Princess Beixiang and cousin Erzhu Shilong fought their way out of Luoyang and initially battled with Emperor Xiaozhuang's troops outside of Luoyang, but eventually withdrew north across the Yellow River. Erzhu Zhao met them at Zhangzi (Èï∑Â≠ê, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and they jointly declared Princess Beixiang's nephew Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang, a distant member of the imperial Yuan clan, emperor, to compete with Emperor Xiaozhuang. Despite the opposition of Gao Huan (who subsequently refused to participate in the campaign), Erzhu Rong advanced south to the Yellow River. Then, surprising Emperor Xiaozhuang, he quickly crossed the Yellow River, entering Luoyang and capturing Emperor Xiaozhuang. He allowed his soldiers to pillage the capital and kill many imperial officials, and he also killed the son of Emperor Xiaozhuang and Erzhu Rong's daughter, Empress Erzhu Ying'e. He then had Emperor Xiaozhuang delivered to Jinyang and, despite Gao's warning not to do so, strangled Emperor Xiaozhuang to death.  Subsequent control of power  In light of the Erzhus' victory, they controlled the government, and Erzhu Zhao was recognized as the supreme military authority, and Yuan Ye created him the Prince of Yinchuan. (Yuan Ye also created Erzhu Zhao's daughter empress, although it is not clear whether Yuan Ye only married her at this point or had already married her previously.) However, he did not have as much control over the clan as Erzhu Rong did, and the imperial government largely was controlled by Erzhu Shilong. Erzhu Zhao himself controlled the provinces north of the Yellow River, while his cousin Erzhu Tianguang controlled the Guanzhong region, and Erzhu Shilong's brother Erzhu Zhongyuan (ÁàæÊú±‰ª≤ÈÅ†) controlled the southeastern provinces. Erzhu Zhao set up his headquarters at Jinyang, where Erzhu Rong's headquarters had been. Around the new year 531, the general Gedouling Bufan (Á¥áË±ÜÈôµÂ∏ÉÁï™), who had been loyal to Emperor Xiaozhuang, attacked Erzhu Zhao from the north, and after scoring victories over him, approached Jinyang. Erzhu Zhao was fearful, and sought aid from Gao Huan. Gao agreed to help him, and together they defeated and killed Gedouling. In light of this joint victory, Erzhu Zhao and Gao swore to be brothers, and he, trusting Gao's faithfulness, gave the remnants of the rebel Ge Rong (ËëõÊ¶Æ), largely ethnic Xianbei, to Gao‚Äîa decision that he would regret later. In spring 531, after Yuan Ye arrived in Luoyang, Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Tianguang, believing that Yuan Ye was too distantly related to the line of recent emperors and lacking in good reputation, forced Yuan Ye to yield the throne to Yuan Gong the Prince of Guangling (who took the throne as Emperor Jiemin). Because Erzhu Shilong did not first consult with Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Zhao became angry and considered attacking Erzhu Shilong. Erzhu Zhao only calmed down and accepted the situation after Erzhu Shilong sent his brother Erzhu Yanbo (ÁàæÊú±ÂΩ•‰ºØ) to Jinyang to explain the decision to him.  Defeat by Gao Huan and death  In summer 531, Gao Huan, believing that the Erzhus had become overly corrupt and therefore vulnerable, decided to rebel. He declared another distant member of the Yuan clan, Yuan Lang, emperor, to compete with Emperor Jiemin. When the Erzhu forces converged at Guang'a (Âª£Èòø, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) to face Gao, Gao used false rumors to make them suspicious of each other‚Äîby making Erzhu Zhao believe that Erzhu Shilong and his brothers were conspiring against him, and by making Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Zhongyuan believing that Erzhu Zhao was conspiring with Gao. As a result, after a major quarrel between Erzhu Zhao and Erzhu Zhongyuan, Erzhu Zhongyuan and Erzhu Rong's cousin Erzhu Dul√º (ÁàæÊú±Â∫¶Âæã) withdrew, leaving Erzhu Zhao, albeit with still a much larger army than Gao's, alone against Gao. Gao subsequently defeated him, and, brushing his army aside, continued to advance south, entering the important city Yecheng in spring 532. The Erzhu forces recoalesced, and to cement the unity, under Erzhu Shilong's suggestion, Emperor Jiemin married another daughter of Erzhu Zhao as his empress. Erzhu Zhao thereafter made a counterattack, trying to capture Yecheng, but was defeated by Gao. After the defeat, instead of turning his army back to Luoyang to join with Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Tianguang (who had by this point arrived from his base in Chang'an), Erzhu Zhao returned to Jinyang. Meanwhile, the general Husi Chun rose against the Erzhus at Luoyang, killing Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Yanbo and capturing Erzhu Tianguang and Erzhu Dul√º, delivering them to Gao, who subsequently killed them after entering Luoyang. Erzhu Zhongyuan fled to Liang, leaving Erzhu Zhao as the only member of the Erzhu clan still remaining with a significant force. He withdrew from Jinyang and set up his new headquarters at Xiurong (ÁßÄÂÆπ, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), the old territory of the Qihu tribe. In spring 532, Gao, after making Erzhu Zhao relax by making multiple announcements of attacks but then not attacking, launched a surprise attack on Xiurong and defeated Erzhu Zhao's forces. Erzhu Zhao fled into the mountains, but, finding his escape route cut off, initially ordered his attendants Zhang Liang (Âºµ‰∫Æ) and Chen Shanti (Èô≥Â±±Êèê) to kill him. When Zhang and Chen could not bear doing so, he hanged himself on a tree after killing his war horse. Gao buried him with honors.

The event lasts officially for six full days: it starts on a Thursday, then follows the usual five days of carnival (from Friday to Wednesday at noon). The term may also be used to comprise related events that happen immediately before or after the carnival in Bahia. Therefore, extending the duration for up to twelve days. The festival happens simultaneously in many sites, being the most famous the Campo Grande track (in the upper part of the city), Barra- Ondina track (by the shore), and Pelourinho (the historical neighborhood). It features many different rhythms and has performances of several music groups. The most traditional presentations are the trio el√©trico parades, and Afro blocks presentations. Estimations state that approximately 2.5 million people (being 1.5 million tourists) participate in the festivities every year. Economic reports show that the festival has a large impact at Salvador‚Äôs local economy. History In 1950, Adolfo Dod√¥ Nascimento and Osmar √Ålvares Mac√™do, better known as Dod√¥ and Osmar created the Fobica, an open float adapted for musical presentations, and the trio el√©trico was born. By 1952, the term trio el√©trico had become generic, in reference to a truck or bus carrying musicians around during Bahian carnival. In 1969, Caetano Veloso's song \\"Atr√°s do trio- el√©trico\\" (Behind the trio-el√©trico) popularized the Trio El√©trico sound nationwide. Today, the presence of Trio El√©trico trucks is one of the main attractions of the Carnaval da Bahia.  Organization   Preceding events and official opening  Starting from the new year's eve, several events loosely related to the carnival happen in Salvador. The most traditional is \\"Lavagem da Escadaria do Bonfim\\" (), which happens since 1745 on the second Thursdays of January. A more recent event is the Salvador Summer Festival, a music festival which usually happens on late January. Some events that are closely related to carnival take place few days before the official opening. The most traditional is the party for the nomination of the year's Carnival's Queen and King Momo. Moreover, the ensaios de carnaval () have become a tradition since the 1990s. Typically, these are private events with informal presentations from the artists that will perform in the carnival. The official carnival opening in Salvador happens in the Thursday immediately before the Ash Wednesday. It happens exactly one day before the traditional carnival calendar, which starts on Friday. The anticipation happens for commercial reasons only. The official opening follows the tradition as in the rest of Brazil: there is a ceremony where the city major gives a symbolic key of the city to King Momo, whom declares that carnival celebrations are officially opened. Parades already happen in the early evening of Thursday.  The Carnival events  Parades and other events happen during the six official days of carnival, for an average of 16 hours a day. The municipality defines the ordering, starting and ending times for each carnival block to parade. Delays may result in fines. The components of a block have a predefined meeting time in the beginning of their track, called concentra√ß√£o (). After the parade concludes its official track, the trio el√©tricos go to a special place called dispers√£o (), where there is no longer separation between members of blocks and the audience. It is not infrequently that artists that were playing in the parade extend their presentations at the dispersion area. Concurrently to the parades happen the informal \\"abad√°\\" business. There, merrymakers sell, buy and exchange \\"abad√°s\\" for the different blocks and VIP cabins. Scalpers are present in significant quantity and act freely. The two most common sites are the Aeroclube Mall and Shopping Barra.  Official ending and post-events  It became a tradition in 2000s that the last regular block to parade is Voa Voa, starting in the morning dawn of Wednesday. Arrast√£o () is the last official event before the carnival ending. It starts on Wednesday early morning, and finishes before noon. There trio-el√©tricos parade the Barra-Ondina track in backward direction (from Ondina, towards the Barra Lighthouse). There is no separation between the block and the audience. The carnival is officially over at Wednesday noon. Ressaca de Carnaval () are the celebrations following immediately after the carnival ending. Porto Seguro, in the south of Bahia, became prominent site for ressaca. Its format is similar to the trio el√©trico street parades in Salvador, with a significant overlap in the performing acts. Morro de S√£o Paulo is another popular site, where there is no official (governmental) organization, and most parties are private. Within one month after the official ending, some media groups host award gala events to recognize outstanding achievement in the carnival. The most traditional accolades are Dod√¥ and Osmar Trophy (Grupo A Tarde), Band Folia Trophy (Rede Bandeirantes) and Trof√©u Bahia Folia (Rede Bahia de Televis√£o). Categories vary between the events. Common ones include best artist, best new artist, best bloco and best song (considered the most prestigious).  Carnival blocos  Meanwhile, the carnaval blocos began to evolve and branch out into various currents of aesthetic, musical, and even religious manifestations. While members of the afox√©s brought their Afro- Brazilian religious cosmology to the Carnaval procession by maintaining their African roots with the puxada do ijex√° (a rhythm played in honor of the orix√°s or Afro-Brazilian deities), the flourishing middle-class blocos mostly relied on carnaval music styled on Rio de Janeiro's samba-enrredos. Then the Afro- blocos emerged with an aesthetical proposal extrapolated from the Indian blocos, introducing some fundamental innovations in the process: parades revolved around themes and music was tailored to fit the occasion. During this phase, Bahia‚Äôs street carnaval was infused with the glamour and elitism propagated by carnaval clubs, initiating a slight reversal of the egalitarian ideal. Bahian carnival musicians With the emergence of new Bahian talent who continued to popularize regional rhythms, Carnaval became more of an organized affair though it somehow retained its informality and contagious spontaneity. The success of Luiz Caldas, Sara Jane, and Chiclete com Banana, along with the evolution of Il√™ Aiy√™ and the emergence of Olodum played a part in transforming Salvador‚Äôs Carnaval into the biggest, longest, most itinerant open-air show in the world. The upper and middle classes finally succumbed to the Carnaval‚Äìinspired ideal of racial harmony and by the end of the 1980s the pre-Lent celebration entered a process of irreversible debauchery. Street carnaval came to represent the collective identity of Bahian Carnaval. By the start of a new decade, Bahia's Carnaval became an institutionalized talent factory. The success of precursors such as Luis Caldas, Chiclete com Banana, Il√™ Aiy√™, Margareth Menezes, and Olodum heralded the convergence of Carnaval and commercial music. Slowly the northeastern and national music markets began to open. Between 1992 and 1993 Bahian Carnaval became the stage for the greatest success in Brazil's musical landscape yet: Daniela Mercury landed the number-one spot in radio stations throughout Brazil with her samba-reggae hit \\"O Canto da Cidade\\". Her show broke public attendance records from Oiapoque to Chu√≠ and she became the first exponent of the new Bahian sound to have a television special on her musical career transmitted on a national station, Rede Globo. Mercury's stunning success radically tore down the preconceptions and barriers that Brazil's musical epicenters had imposed on Bahian music with origins entrenched in carnaval. Ironically, Mercury's huge success on a national scale transformed her into Bahian Carnaval's main artist. She achieved that distinction long after having conquered a niche in Bahia and having participated in many carnavals.

NCRC has been shut down on 31 Dec 2007 and its CEO & staff, programmes and governance mechanisms have been transferred to the long-term entity BEDROC. Genesis The tsunami that hit the south-eastern coast of India resulted in an immediate action by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) throughout the country in rushing requirements and providing relief to the victims. The South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS) and SNEHA, NGOs working in the fishing, initiated an NGO Coordination Centre (NCC) in Nagapattinam District Collectorate since 1 January 2005 for enabling a more coordinated action and interaction between the District Administration, NGOs and areas affected by the tsunami in the district. During the first month of relief operations, the NGO Co-ordination Centre ensured a transparent relationship with the government officers on a daily basis. About 400 NGOs registered at the centre during the first few days. Using these volunteers, the NGO Co-ordination centre set up a two-way information flow on the requirements of the villages and the materials available with the government and NGOs. Three months later, NGO Coordination Centre metamorphosed into NGO Coordination and Resource Centre (NCRC) to continue its activities in the rehabilitation phase. NCRC adopted the model of public-private partnering by promoting coordination among the NGOs and the government.  Village Information Centre(VIC) of NCRC   Origin  The district of Nagapattinam has a coastal line of 141 km. The devastation in Nagapattinam has severely affected about 80 villages. Many more have faced damage in varying degrees. Fishing villages dominate this coastal district and nearly 70 percent of the severely affected villages are fishing villages. NCRC has selected 12 strategic locations in this region and has set up village information centre to maximize the reach throughout this district. Each VIC covers five to six villages. What do information centres do? * Collect information from the communities on details of damages, compensations, allotment of houses, etc. at the village level and provide them with information on support and services available. * Provide information to NCRC and other stakeholders on what is happening in the field * Reach out to the communities in backward and vulnerable areas to ensure that they have access to support and that their needs are accounted for in the rehabilitation process * Coordinate with support organisations and service provides whenever support and services are required  Closure  As decided during its initiation, NCRC has been shut down in its current form on 31 Dec 2007. This was primarily because NCRC was a pro-term project and had no legal status. Considering the fact that many of the initiatives that NCRC had launched were longer-term in nature, the Steering Committee of NCRC decided to set up a new legal entity to take forward the longer-term initiatives started by it. This organization, Building and Enabling Disaster Resilience of Coastal Communities (BEDROC), launched in January 2008, continues with the same CEO (Ms. Annie George) and her team, as well as most of the Steering Committee.

These make it easier for people with few computer skills to work with and use computer software. This article explains the most common elements of visual language interfaces found in the WIMP (\\"window, icon, menu, pointer\\") paradigm, although many are also used at other graphical post-WIMP interfaces. These elements are usually embodied in an interface using a widget toolkit or desktop environment.  Structural elements  Graphical user interfaces use visual conventions to represent the generic information shown. Some conventions are used to build the structure of the static elements on which the user can interact, and define the appearance of the interface.  Window  A window is an area on the screen that displays information, with its contents being displayed independently from the rest of the screen. An example of a window is what appears on the screen when the \\"My Documents\\" icon is clicked in the Windows Operating System. It is easy for a user to manipulate a window: it can be shown and hidden by clicking on an icon or application, and it can be moved to any area by dragging it (that is, by clicking in a certain area of the window ‚Äì usually the title bar along the top ‚Äì and keeping the pointing device's button pressed, then moving the pointing device). A window can be placed in front or behind another window, its size can be adjusted, and scrollbars can be used to navigate the sections within it. Multiple windows can also be open at one time, in which case each window can display a different application or file ‚Äì this is very useful when working in a multitasking environment. The system memory is the only limitation to the number of windows that can be open at once. There are also many types of specialized windows. * A container window encloses other windows or controls. When it is moved or resized, the enclosed items move, resize, reorient, or are clipped by the container window. * A browser window allows the user to view and navigate through a collection of items, such as files or web pages. Web browsers are an example of these types of windows. * Text terminal windows present a character-based, command-driven text user interfaces within the overall graphical interface. MS-DOS and UNIX consoles are examples of these types of windows. Terminal windows often conform to the hotkey and display conventions of CRT-based terminals that predate GUIs, such as the VT-100. * A child window opens automatically or as a result of a user activity in a parent window. Pop-up windows on the Internet can be child windows. * A message window, or dialog box, is a type of child window. These are usually small and basic windows that are opened by a program to display information to the user and/or get information from the user. They almost always have one or more buttons, which allow the user to dismiss the dialog with an affirmative, negative, or neutral response. Menu Menus allow the user to execute commands by selecting from a list of choices. Options are selected with a mouse or other pointing device within a GUI. A keyboard may also be used. Menus are convenient because they show what commands are available within the software. This limits the amount of documentation the user reads to understand the software. * A menu bar is displayed horizontally across the top of the screen and/or along the tops of some or all windows. A pull-down menu is commonly associated with this menu type. When a user clicks on a menu option the pull-down menu will appear. * A menu has a visible title within the menu bar. Its contents are only revealed when the user selects it with a pointer. The user is then able to select the items within the pull-down menu. When the user clicks elsewhere the content of the menu will disappear. * A context menu is invisible until the user performs a specific mouse action, like pressing the right mouse button. When the software-specific mouse action occurs the menu will appear under the cursor. * Menu extras are individual items within or at the side of a menu. Icons An icon is a small picture that represents objects such as a file, program, web page, or command. They are a quick way to execute commands, open documents, and run programs. Icons are also very useful when searching for an object in a browser list, because in many operating systems all documents using the same extension will have the same icon. Controls (or widgets) Interface elements known as graphical control elements, controls or widgets are software components that a computer user interacts with through direct manipulation to read or edit information about an application. Each widget facilitates a specific user-computer interaction. Structuring a user interface with Widget toolkits allow developers to reuse code for similar tasks, and provides users with a common language for interaction, maintaining consistency throughout the whole information system. Common uses for widgets involve the display of collections of related items (such as with various list and canvas controls), initiation of actions and processes within the interface (buttons and menus), navigation within the space of the information system (links, tabs and scrollbars), and representing and manipulating data values (such as labels, check boxes, radio buttons, sliders, and spinners.) Tabs A tab is typically a rectangular small box which usually contains a text label or graphical icon associated with a view pane. When activated the view pane, or window, displays widgets associated with that tab; groups of tabs allow the user to switch quickly between different widgets. This is used in the web browsers Firefox, Internet Explorer, Konqueror, Opera, and Safari. With these browsers, you can have multiple web pages open at once in one window, and quickly navigate between them by clicking on the tabs associated with the pages. Tabs are usually placed in groups at the top of a window, but may also be grouped on the side or bottom of a window. Tabs are also present in the settings panes of many applications. Microsoft Windows, for example, uses tabs in most of its control panel dialogues.  Interaction elements  Some common idioms for interaction have evolved in the visual language used in GUIs. Interaction elements are interface objects that represent the state of an ongoing operation or transformation, either as visual remainders of the user intent (such as the pointer), or as affordances showing places where the user may interact.  Cursor  A cursor is an indicator used to show the position on a computer monitor or other display device that will respond to input from a text input or pointing device. Pointer The pointer echoes movements of the pointing device, commonly a mouse or touchpad. The pointer is the place where actions take place that are initiated through direct manipulation gestures such as click, touch and drag. Insertion point The caret, text cursor or insertion point represents the point of the user interface where the focus is located. It represents the object that will be used as the default subject of user-initiated commands such as writing text, starting a selection or a copy-paste operation through the keyboard.  Selection  A selection is a list of items on which user operations will take place. The user typically adds items to the list manually, although the computer may create a selection automatically.  Adjustment handle  A handle is an indicator of a starting point for a drag and drop operation. Usually the pointer shape changes when placed on the handle, showing an icon that represents the supported drag operation.

The film is based on W. Somerset Maugham's 1921 short story \\"Miss Thompson\\" (later retitled \\"Rain\\"). Other film versions include Sadie Thompson (1928) starring Gloria Swanson, Rain (1932) starring Joan Crawford, and Dirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A., a 1946 race film. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song (\\"Sadie Thompson's Song\\") at 26th Academy Awards - Music by Lester Lee and Lyrics by Ned Washington. They were edged out for the award by the more popular hit, \\"Secret Love\\" from Calamity Jane ‚Äì Music by Sammy Fain and Lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Plot A bar girl from Hawaii, a religious zealot and a love-struck Marine struggle with sin and salvation just after World War II while Sadie Thompson kicks out several songs, including the Oscar-nominated \\"Blue Pacific Blues\\".

Edwards (as Charles Buchinsky) * Frances Morri as Mrs. MacPhail Production In February 1952 producer Jerry Wald announced he had the film rights to the play adaptation of Rain from producer Lester Cowan. Wald had a production unit at RKO with Norman Krasna and wanted to make it as a musical in color. In October 1953 Wald left RKO to become a vice president and executive producer at Columbia Pictures. He planned to personally produce two films a year and said one of these would be Rain. It would star Rita Hayworth, who was the biggest star at the studio. Harry Kleiner was assigned to write the script. Plans were made to shoot the film in 3-D. This was Hayworth's third film after her marriage to Prince Aly Khan had kept her off screen for four years. The public eagerly welcomed her return in two previous films Affair in Trinidad and Salome so Columbia gave Miss Sadie Thompson an \\"A\\" film budget. \\"It would give her the chance to not be glamorous\\", said Wald. 3-D films had become a fad, with some 3-D films drawing huge crowds in major cities, so it was used as well. Exteriors were filmed on the island of Kauai, Hawaii and interiors on the Columbia lot. The original story of sin and redemption was sanitized to appease the Production Code and several musical numbers were inserted to spice up the tepid reworked plot. As with her previous films, Hayworth's singing was dubbed, this time by Jo Ann Greer. In August 1953 Hayworth and Ray shot some additional romantic scenes. By the time of the premiere on December 23, 1953, interest in 3-D had died down considerably. After a two-week run, all 3-D prints were pulled. The film was given a national release \\"flat\\", in other words, in regular prints, minus the 3-D. The film was banned in some territories such as Memphis. Reviews Variety wrote, \\"She catches the feel of the title character well, even to braving completely deglamorizing makeup, costuming and photography to fit her physical appearance to that of the bawdy, shady lady that was Sadie Thompson\\". The Village Voice wrote, \\"Although its Hays Code sanitizing is mitigated somewhat by the glorious extravagances of 1950s cinema (it's a Technicolor, 3-D star vehicle with musical numbers), Miss Sadie Thompson (1953) is a scoured version of Rain (1932).\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote, \\"The character of Sadie is drained of considerable point by the prudence of the producers. And Miss Hayworth is left with a role in which she is able to inject very little, outside her own particular brand of appeal\\".

The beltway runs north to south from Gdynia to Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski and is long. Together with the S≈Çupsk bypass, it forms a part of the S6 expressway which will eventually run from Szczecin to Gda≈Ñsk. It is also part of the european route E28.  History  Construction started in the 1970s and the first section was opened for use in 1977. Due to a lack of funds during the 1980s, construction was delayed many times. The fall of communism in 1990 also slowed down construction. Major sections of the beltway were completed in 2001 with the last two major junctions finished in 2008. The various stages were constructed in the following years: *1973-1977: northbound lanes Gdynia ‚Äì Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski *1978-1984: southbound lanes Gdynia ‚Äì Straszyn *1987-1989: Kowale Junction *1994-1996: Wysoka Junction *2000-2001: southbound lanes Straszyn ‚Äì Juszkowo *2002-2003: road maintenance and resurfacing *2006-2007: connection to the A1 motorway *2006-2008: junction with Trasa Kwiatkowskiego  Transport infrastructure  Obwodnica Tr√≥jmiasta - The extra third lane is visible on the left The beltway is an important piece of infrastructure in the Pomeranian Voivodeship since it eases congestion through the center of the Tricity area as well as diverting transit traffic. The beltway connects Gda≈Ñsk Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa Airport with the rest of the Voivodeship and is an integral part of the Tricity economy, helping boost future growth in the region. The Obwodnica Tr√≥jmiejska is also one of the few orbital, beltway and ring roads that bypass major cities in Poland. Cities such as Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫ lack a complete bypass, causing transit traffic to go through the city center. This causes frustration among the local population, increases congestion, environmental damage and pollution. However, the Polish government intends to finish construction on many of the major expressways and motorways that will criss- cross the country and bypass major cities by the year 2013.  Road conditions  The beltway is currently in good condition, compared to many of the major roads in Poland. The fact that the expressway is relatively new and modernized makes it one of the best roads in Poland today. There are two lanes in each direction; in some places a third lane is available during curved or up-hill sections. The road is cleared regularly during heavy snowfall, which can be a hazard during winter. Overall, the road is safer than other roads in the region, although accidents do tend to happen.  Current development  A new junction connecting the south end of the Tricity Beltway to the A1 motorway has been completed by 22 December 2007. It enables traveling up to GrudziƒÖdz using a motorway, and when the A1 is completed, it will connect Gda≈Ñsk through Toru≈Ñ, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and Katowice, to the Czech border in the south. The A1 motorway is planned to be completed in 2016. On the 12 June 2008, Trasa im. Eugeniusza Kwiatkowskiego was completed and finally connected the Port of Gdynia to the Beltway, bypassing the local city streets. This reduced truck traffic in residential areas greatly since all heavy trucks heading towards the port used national road 6, which goes through the center of the city. From 2006 and onwards, the junction with ul. Morska in Gdynia is being modernized in order to smoothen traffic congestion on the national road 6. The final location of the S6 express road is still being evaluated although it is likely to connect roughly midway through the beltway. This will cause the northern part of the beltway to be renumbered from the junction with the S6 to ul. Morska in Gdynia. Construction of the S6 is not intended to be started for a number of years because of more critical routes that need to be constructed first. There are plans to create a so-called Tricity corridor, by modernizing existing roads and building new ones. National roads 7 and 20 will be modernized with some new sections to bypass towns, with the planned S6 completing the corridor. The A1 motorway from the end of the beltway to Toru≈Ñ should be completed by 2011, with the remainder of the road from Toru≈Ñ to the Czech border due to be finished by 2016, giving the residents of the Pomeranian Voivodeship their first access to the Polish and European motorway network.

Sometimes seen as a normal part of warfare, it is nowadays widely considered a crime. Slave raiding has occurred since antiquity. Some of the earliest surviving written records of slave raiding come from Sumer (in present-day Iraq). The act of slave raiding involves an organized and concerted attack on a settlement with the purpose of taking the areas' people. The collected new slaves are often kept in some form of slave pen or depot. From there, the slave takers will transport them to a distant place by means such as a slave ship or camel caravan. When conquered people are enslaved and remain in their place, it is not raiding. Slave raiding was a violent method of economic development where a resource shortage was addressed with the acquisition by force of the desired resource, in this case human labor. Other than the element of slavery being present, such violent seizure of a resource does not differ from similar raids to gain food or any other desired commodity. Slave raiding was a large and lucrative trade on the coasts of Africa, in ancient Europe, Mesoamerica and in medieval Asia. The Crimean-Nogai raids into East Slavic lands provided some two or three million slaves to the Ottoman Empire over the course of four centuries. The Ottoman corsairs from the 16th century onwards through 1830 engaged in razzias in Africa and the European coastal areas as far away as Iceland, capturing slaves for the Muslim slavery market in North Africa and the Middle East. The Atlantic slave trade was predicated on European countries endorsing and supporting slave raiding between African tribes to supply the workforce of agricultural plantations in the Americas. Spanish slave raiding in Chile Albeit there was a general ban of slavery of indigenous people by Spanish Crown the 1598‚Äì1604 Mapuche uprising that ended with the Destruction of the Seven Cities made the Spanish in 1608 declare slavery legal for those Mapuches caught in war.Valenzuela M√°rquez 2009, p. 231‚Äì233 Mapuches \\"rebels\\" were considered Christian apostates and could therefore be enslaved according to the church teachings of the day.Foerster 1993, p. 21. In reality these legal changes only formalized Mapuche slavery that was already occurring at the time, with captured Mapuches being treated as property in the way that they were bought and sold among the Spanish. Legalisation made Spanish slave raiding increasingly common in the Arauco War. Mapuche slaves were exported north to places such as La Serena and Lima.Valenzuela M√°rquez 2009, pp. 234‚Äì236 The Mapuche uprising of 1655 had parts of its background in the slave hunting expeditions of Juan de Salazar, including his failed 1654 expedition.Barros Arana 2000, p. 348.Barros Arana 2000, p. 349.

Life M√∏ller was elected as a Conservative member of the Folketing and in 1928 became leader of his party, a role he still held at the beginning of the Second World War. After the German occupation of Denmark, he joined a coalition cabinet, but in October 1940, following German pressure, he was forced to resign from the government, as the German authorities felt he was too negative towards them. Three months later, in 1941, he was forced to abandon his seat in parliament altogether for the same reason. He was then instrumental in founding the underground newspaper Frit Danmark. In 1942, M√∏ller fled with his family to England, where he hoped to become part of a Danish government in exile. However, his most important role in London proved to be as a broadcaster for BBC Radio's Danish language service aimed at occupied Denmark. He spoke out against the Danish government's collaborative stance towards the Germans and encouraged sabotage and other resistance activities, becoming enormously popular as a result. On 2 October 1943, an article by Christmas M√∏ller appeared in Frit Danmark which urged all Danes to do what they could to help their Jewish fellow citizens who had gone into hiding from the Nazis' planned roundup.

Early history In 1992, Buckler started racing in regional Porsche Club races, working his way through the ranks before entering his first professional race at the 1995 IMSA Grand Prix of California, which he ended up winning. From then until 2001, The Racer's Group ran part-time schedules with various drivers. Just before the 2002 season started, the Porsche factory offered to support the team at the Rolex 24 at Daytona by lending the services of factory drivers Timo Bernhard and J√∂rg Bergmeister. Major victories After seven previous attempts at Daytona, The Racer's Group, with drivers Buckler, Bernhard, Bergmeister, and Michael Schrom, won the GT class at the 2002 Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona. With the success of the team at Daytona, the Porsche factory again provided TRG with factory support and drivers for the 2002 24 Hours of Le Mans. In one of the closest GT races in history, Buckler, Bernhard, and Lucas Luhr edged the Freisinger Motorsport team by little more than one minute to capture a win at the team's maiden run at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. As the American Le Mans Series and Grand American seasons continued, The Racer's Group strung together a long series of high finishes, including wins at the Grand Prix of Mosport, Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio, and the Grand-Am 400 at California Speedway. TRG finished on the podium 14 times in 2002, including 8 in a row in the ALMS. After the season, Buckler and co-driver Schrom had a 1-2 finish in the Porsche World Cup. The award, given annually to the top independent Porsche drivers in the world, was given to Buckler at the Porsche factory in Weissach, Germany, in December 2002. Buckler and Schrom were the first and only teammates to finish 1-2 in the Porsche Cup. They followed the award up with a win at the 24 Hours of Daytona since 1977, becoming the first GT-class team to win overall. Pontiac GTO.R GM factory team 2003 and the few years beyond saw TRG continue to compete in ALMS and Grand American. In 2005, TRG was selected by GM as a factory team. Pontiac Motorsports and TRG teamed up to race the new generation of Pontiac GTO vehicles, specifically twin GTO.R's. GM brought in Paul Edwards and Jan Magnussen to drive the No. 64, while TRG hired Marc Bunting and Andy Lally to drive of the No. 65. In 2006, Kelly Collins replaced Magnussen, the same year Pontiac won the manufacturer's championship, TRG took 1st and 3rd in the team championship, and drivers Bunting and Lally took won the driver's championship. In 2006, Marc Bunting and Andy Lally won the GT drivers championship, and Bunting won the Bob Akin Sportsman Award. TRG won the GT team championship, second straight year. Lally and Bunting broke the record for most podium finishes with 14 of a possible 16 this year. The old record was their own, set in 2004 of 11 podium finishes. The TRG GTO.R Daytona 24 Hour effort was the subject of a six-part documentary by noted film maker Sean Heckman and is currently playing on INHD. 2007‚Äìpresent 2011 GT car No. 67 The GTO program has been discontinued by GM as of the 2006 season end, and TRG returned Porsche vehicles in 2007, as well as running in the DP class. They began 2008 with second, third, and fourth-place finishes at the 24 Hours of Daytona. For the 2015 United SportsCar Championship season, TRG entered one Aston Martin Vantage GT3 for a full season with drivers Christina Nielsen and James Davison running the number 007. TRG entry page on the IMSA site The team recorded a runner-up class finish at Sebring. NASCAR Bobby Labonte in the No. 71 car at Daytona International Speedway in 2010 Co-driver R. J. Valentine announced Lally's plans to race in the NASCAR Busch Series, possibly with support from TRG during the broadcast of the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series GT Race at Iowa Speedway on July 14, 2007. Lally raced the No. 47 Clorox Ford Fusion in the NASCAR Busch Series road races at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on August 4 and Watkins Glen on August 11 as part of a partnership between TRG and Wood Brothers/JTG Racing. He finished 29th and 10th respectively. In October 2007, TRG purchased the assets of Darrell Waltrip Motorsports' Craftsman Truck Series team, with Lally serving as the team's driver and United States Army Reserve sponsoring the No. 00 Toyota Tundra. In 2008, TRG switched to Chevrolet Silverados and formed a second team. They began the 2008 season fielding entries in the No. 7 for Lally and the No. 71 for fellow rookie Donny Lia. Lia won in his 8th career start in Mansfield driving the No. 71 TRG truck. Midway through the season, sponsorship issues forced Lally to cut a part-time schedule. He was replaced by Nevada driver T. J. Bell for the rest of the season. Lally would return to the No. 71 late in the year when the team released Lia, followed by Ben Stancill and J. R. Fitzpatrick. Bell had a streak of five consecutive top-tens and had a total of seven on the year. In 2009, TRG Motorsports announced they would field a full-time team in the NASCAR Sprint Cup with the number 71. The team also ran a second car in a few races using the number 70. After failing to make the Daytona 500 with Mike Wallace, the team signed David Gilliland and was 35th in points after Bristol, guaranteeing the team a start in Martinsville, only to fall out of the top-35 after the event. They were sponsored by Capital Windows and had announced an agreement to be sponsored by American Monster that fell through. The team shut down its Truck team very early into the season. In the summer, TaxSlayer.com became the team's new sponsor. Starting with the September race in Atlanta, Bobby Labonte began to share the ride with Gilliland. Mike Bliss also filled in for the team on occasion. Labonte competed the first half of the season for the team in 2010. TaxSlayer.com sponsored the team for twelve races. Since the team was not sponsored for the full season, a number of races resulted in a start-and-park situation. At Dover, the team quit after 65 laps. On June 23, Labonte parted ways with TRG Motorsports. Bliss finished ninth at Daytona. Andy Lally, Landon Cassill, Chad McCumbee and Tony Raines also drove the No. 71. Hermie Sadler made his first start since 2006 at the October Martinsville race. Brendan Gaughan raced at Phoenix, his first Cup race since 2004. Despite the team's sponsorship troubles and driver changes, TRG Motorsports finished 35th in the owner's points, guaranteeing the team a start for the first five races of 2011. Owner Kevin Buckler said on NASCAR Race Hub before the Watkins Glen race that the No. 71 team would continue to race full-time in 2011. Lally announced he would run for Rookie of the Year honors. On March 23, 2011, Buckler announced that the team is switching manufacturers to Ford, beginning at Texas. They also went into a support program with Roush Fenway Racing.TRG switching manufacturers? - Jayski \\"Buckler said TRG will campaign new cars as part of a 'light technological support program' with Roush Fenway Racing and new Ford FR9 powerplants from Roush Yates Engines.\\" Late in 2011, TRG ran a second car, a No. 77. Lally drove the car at Charlotte (with Hermie Sadler in the 71) to a 42nd-place finish. T. J. Bell attempted Talladega in the car, with the late Dan Wheldon's name adorning the namerail, but did not qualify. The No. 71 entry struggled at the end of the season and finished 36th in owner's points, not guaranteeing the team a start for the first five races of 2012. TRG suspended its NASCAR team for 2012. Lally left NASCAR and returned to the Rolex Sports Car Series.

The piece pokes fun at the china collecting craze of the later Victorian era, which was part of the Aesthetic movement later satirised in Patience and The Colonel. The story of the sketch involves an engaged man and woman who each schemes to sell off the other's purportedly valuable china. Cups and Saucers premiered in 1876 as part of an evening of piano sketches by Grossmith and was adopted by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1878 as a curtain raiser to H.M.S. Pinafore and, later, other operas. Background and productions Cups and Saucers was first produced in 1876 on tour as a vehicle for Grossmith and Florence Marryat, as part of Entre Nous, their series of piano sketches. It was then performed by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company from August 1878 to February 1880 at the Opera Comique as a curtain raiser to H.M.S. Pinafore. It was also toured by that company in 1883 (with Iolanthe) and in 1884 and was revived in 1890 at the Globe Theatre (from 6 to 12 December for 6 performances, as the curtain raiser to Richard Temple's production of Gounod's The Mock Doctor).Walters, Michael and George Low. \\"Cups and Saucers Introduction\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2011, accessed 27 February 2017 The piece was recorded by Retrospect Opera in 2016, with Simon Butteriss as General Deelah and Gaynor Keeble as Mrs. Worcester, together with F.

J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning such curtain raisers: :This was a one-act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half-empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen-Pope, Walter James.

Mrs. Worcester is in her morning room anticipating a visit from General Deelah. She recounts how she came to own the single but highly valuable item in her china collection (\\"A Friend Most Dear\\"), the sole remaining saucer from Julius Caesar's favorite tea service, appraised at ten thousand pounds. General Deelah arrives, and, after some shy conversation and gentle flirting, the conversation turns to their china collections. Mrs. Worcester notes that she has but one small saucer and inquires of the General's china collection. Deelah boasts that he has a very large collection of china, but states in an aside, \\"--in China.\\" He quickly changes the subject by asking, \\"Would it surprise you to learn that I am related to the Chinese?\\" He then sings of an extravagantly wealthy Chinese merchant named Foo Choo Chan who wished nothing more than to be English (\\"Foo Choo Chan Was a Merchant of Japan\\"). The relationship turned out to be Foo Choo Chan's marriage to the \\"sister of [Deelah's] brother's second aunt, by an uncle on [Deelah's] grandmother's side.\\" Deelah professes his love for Mrs. Worcester, whereupon she pretends to have fainted until she spots him snooping around for her famed Julius Caesar saucer. She then \\"recovers\\" and announces that since she is Deelah's true love, she can now reveal her most prized possession to him. To Deelah's horror, he finds that it is a counterfeit ‚Äì of his own make ‚Äì which he admits to Mrs. Worcester. To her horror, he also admits that his own collection of china is his own make as well. She orders Deelah to leave, and Deelah bids her farewell, attempting to make her regret her decision (\\"The Farewell Song\\"). Deelah then admits that he never had any real interest in china, but that society had forced him \\"with the alternative of being thought vulgar, to pretend an affection for its inartistic, ugly beauties at which [his] true soul actually revolts!\\" Deelah further explains: :A set of vagabonds who infest England have bought up every bit of Oriental ware, are doctoring it up, making it look dirty, cracking it, and then palming it off on would be fashionable folks as real oriental ware. One little town in Japan had been completely cleaned out of every cup and saucer, and the poor Japanese were compelled to drink their tea out of ink bottles and blacking pots. I could not bear to see this. So I started a firm for the manufacture of English china to supply the wants of the natives, and I flatter myself I am doing very well. General Deelah once again proposes to Mrs. Worcester, who agrees, and they decide to \\"give up old china and live in Japan, and make cups and saucers as fast as we can\\" (\\"We'll Give Up Old China and Live in Japan\\").

History The concept of dawn simulation was first patented in 1890 as \\"mechanical sunrise\\". Modern electronic units were patented in 1973. Variations and improvements seem to get patented every few years. Clinical trials were conducted by David Avery, MD, in the 1980s at Columbia University following a long line of basic laboratory research that showed animals' circadian rhythms to be exquisitely sensitive to the dim, gradually rising dawn signal at the end of the night. Clinical use There are two types of dawn that have been used effectively in a clinical setting: a naturalistic dawn mimicking a springtime sunrise (but used in mid-winter when it is still dark outside), and a sigmoidal-shaped dawn (30 minutes to 2 hours). When used successfully, patients are able to sleep through the dawn and wake up easily at the simulated sunrise, after which the day's treatment is over. The theory behind dawn simulation is based on the fact that early morning light signals are much more effective at advancing the biological clock than are light signals given at other times of day (see Phase response curve). Comparison with bright light therapy Dawn simulation generally uses light sources that range in illuminance from 100 to 300 lux, while bright light boxes are usually in the 10,000-lux range. Approximately 19% of patients discontinue post-awakening bright light therapy due to inconvenience. Because the entire treatment is complete before awakening, dawn simulation may be a more convenient alternative to post-awakening bright light therapy. In terms of efficacy, some studies have shown dawn simulation to be more effective than standard bright light therapy while others have shown no difference or shown that bright light therapy is superior. Some patients with seasonal affective disorder use both dawn simulation and bright light therapy to provide maximum effect at the start of the day. Other uses In an elaboration of the method, patients have also been presented with a dim dusk signal at bedtime, with indications that it eases sleep onset. In addition, the technique has been used clinically with patients who suffer from delayed sleep phase syndrome, helping them to awaken earlier in gradual steps, as the simulated dawn is moved earlier. Non-clinical sleep and wake-up uses A dawn simulator can be used as an alarm clock. Light enters through the eyelids triggering the body to begin its wake-up cycle, including the release of cortisol, so that by the time the light is at full brightness, sleepers wake up on their own, without the need for an alarm.

Its boundaries are roughly, Olson Memorial Highway to the north, Lyndale Avenue to the east, Bassett Creek to the south, and Theodore Wirth Park to the west. Two of Prince's childhood homes are located in the Harrison Neighborhood, at 1707 Glenwood Avenue and 539 Newton Avenue North. Sources vary as to the dates that he resided at these addresses. Prince lived with his father at 1707 Glenwood Avenue (apartment 105) around 1970 to 1972[4]. He also lived with his father at 539 Newton Avenue North around 1972 to 1974[4]. Prince continued to visit his father at this house in Harrison well into his career as an internationally acclaimed musician. Prince Rogers Nelson was listed on county records as the property owner at the time of Prince's death. The Harrison Neighborhood area began forming as an identifiable urban neighborhood in the late 1800s and early 1900s, many residents were of Finnish heritage. From approximately 1900 to 1960 much of the Harrison Neighborhood area was informally and widely known as the 'Finn Town' of the Minneapolis St. Paul vicinity[5]. From around the 1960s, Harrison began to lose its Finnish identity and gradually evolved into a very multi-racial and multi-ethnic neighborhood. References 4\\\\.

This can be done for various reasons including giving better ground clearance over rough terrain, a lower ground clearance to improve performance and fuel economy at high speed, or for stylistic reasons. Such a feature requires fairly sophisticated engineering. Citro√´n CX in high position Height adjustment is most often achieved by air or oil compression used for the \\"springs\\" of the vehicle when the pressure is varied the vehicle body rises or lowers. Factory systems for cars Height adjustable suspension from 1954 high position An Audi A8 Multi Media Interface control screen for its Adaptive Air Suspension, which gives the vehicle clearance a range from 95 mm to 145 mm Kneeling bus in Dublin The first instance of a production vehicle with adjustable suspension was on the 1954 Citro√´n 15CVH. This vehicle featured a self-leveling, height adjustable hydropneumatic suspension. Since this time, these systems have appeared continuously on Citro√´n models, including the DS and CX. Height adjustable suspension was banned in the United States from 1974 to 1981, due to the stringent interpretation of passenger vehicle bumper height regulations by the U.S. government agency NHTSA. Subaru was one of a few manufacturers who offered the feature after the ban was lifted on the Subaru XT, the Subaru Leone wagon and the Subaru Legacy for a short time. Many modern SUVs use height adjustability as part of active suspension systems to improve the vehicle's versatility on and off-road. The Range Rover offered this feature from 1993. New models of the Ford Expedition have a computer- controlled system designed for convenience, which lowers automatically when the doors are unlocked by remote, returns to normal height when the vehicle is started, and (on 4-wheel-drive models), raises when the 4x4 system is engaged. Some cars use these systems to improve the vehicle's handling by lowering the vehicle's height during higher speeds a current example being the Mercedes- Benz Active Body Control system. Another example is the Audi A8, which when driven at speeds of more than 120 km/h for more than 30 seconds reduces its clearance from 120 mm to 95 mm. The new 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee also includes adjustable suspension in the 4x4 model. It automatically lowers when the Park selection is engaged, and also lowers at high speeds to improve aerodynamics. It also allows drivers to manually raise the suspension for off-road situations. Starting in 2012, the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X offer their own patented height adjustable suspension as an option. Two goals are accomplished the long, low slung car can be raised to avoid road obstacles it also lowers at speed on the highway to improve aerodynamics. Factory systems for buses Height adjustable air suspensions are also equipped on some buses, mainly \\"low-floor\\" city buses or \\"kneeling buses\\", however in recent years some high floor charter/intercity buses have been equipped with this feature as well. This allows the floor to be lowered when the bus is stopped, to allow people with large or bulky luggage, passengers with disabilities, or simply when stopping at stops with unusual curb arrangements to enter or exit the vehicle easily. It can also raise the bus more than normal, which is useful when navigating roads with large amounts of speed humps, crossing railway lines or in other unusual, but not always uncommon situations. Assistive technology for persons with disabilities includes vehicles modified with height adjustable suspension, for example to allow wheelchair entry to the vehicle. Aftermarket systems In 1959, auto customizer Ron Aguirre scavenged the Pesco pumps and valves from a B-52 Bomber and adapted them to the front suspension of his X-Sonic bubble-topped custom car Corvette, allowing him to change the height of the car with a switch on the dashboard. This was done to evade California law regarding ground clearance. Aguirre is commonly accepted as the first person to create a Lowrider car with hydraulically adjustable suspension. Another customizer, Gene Winfield, created The Reactor (show rod) with height adjustable suspension in 1964, a car novel enough to guest star in several television programs. Aftermarket height adjustable suspension installed on 1964 Chevrolet Impala lowrider Adjustable suspensions have become intrinsically associated with lowrider vehicles. The popular image of these vehicles is of one \\"hopping\\" on its suspension, or sitting with one wheel completely off the ground. These systems were initially adapted from the hydraulic pistons, valves and pumps used to adjust the flaps on aircraft. Today however, many aftermarket companies produce parts and equipment specifically designed for lowriders. In recent years \\"air bag\\" systems (not to be confused with the air bag safety device) have been rapidly gaining popularity among car customizers. These air suspension systems use heavy-duty custom rubber \\"bags\\" to replace the stock shocks and springs, with either a compressor or tank of compressed gas used to raise and lower the vehicle at will. Any light-duty truck, from a small suv Chevrolet S10 Blazer to a full-size truck such as Dodge Ram 3500, can be outfitted to adjust the vehicle so that the frame will lie on the ground when the air bags are deflated, or \\"Laid Out\\". Trucks are also capable of \\"laying\\" the pinch weld of the body, or \\"Bodydrop\\" using a technique such as channeling the frame or building an entirely new frame. User control The first height adjustable suspension systems were controlled by the driver manually. With the development of computer controls, research is ongoing into electronic control of the height adjustment process. Certain modern layouts allow electronics alone to make this decision without the driver's control, notably the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model X References Category:Automotive suspension technologies ","title":"Height adjustable suspension"},{"id":"7074566","text":"The Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra: Strive for Jive is a live video recording of the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin in a jazz club setting.

Despite being a NYHC band based in Yonkers, Breakdown didn't have the Lower East Side Crew-mentality of Warzone and Agnostic Front. By a similar token, unlike some of their other contemporaries like Gorilla Biscuits and Youth of Today, Breakdown was not a straight edge positive band. They are considered more along the lines of Sheer Terror for their more metallic sound and less- than-positive lyrics. However, Breakdown always had somewhat of a tongue-in- cheek element to them, mostly due to singer Jeff Perlin's humorous live banter and lyrics. Contrary to popular belief, the original Breakdown lineup only lasted for less than a year. The band continued on with new members over the years, with Jeff Perlin being the only original member, when Jeff isn't playing gigs with the band he is employed at a local Wendy's as a cook. Through all the years Breakdown never did a tour of the U.S., concentrating mostly on the Northeast and Canada. They toured Europe 4 times (1999, 2001, 2009, 2010) with European bands including Rykers and Backfire. They also toured Japan in 2001. Starting in 2003 through 2007 Perlin was the vocalist for Slumlords, a Baltimore-based hardcore/punk band. Slumlords allowed Perlin to write lyrics with a much less serious slant while allowing for a more diverse vocal delivery by adding punk, rock n roll and some heavy metal to the mix while still relying on hardcore for the basis of their sound. Breakdown started playing gigs again in 2008, most notably the Black N Blue Bowl held in Brooklyn, NYC and the Built to Last Festival in Providence, RI in May 2009. They have also played gigs in NYC in September 2009 and the Baltimore \\"Fall Brawl\\" in October 2009. They played two gigs in Europe in November 2009 (Antwerp, Belgium and Leipzig, Germany) to support Backfire for their last two performances as well as a 4 date tour of Netherlands, Germany, France and Belgium in August 2010. In November 2010 they made their triumphant return to New York City's Webster Hall (which they last played 1988 when it was called The Ritz) opening for Sheer Terror. There have been rumors of Breakdown working on new material for general release, which would be their first output since 2001. But these rumors have been laid to rest after Breakdown decided to pack it in and not record or play any additional shows as of February 2011. In February 2012 it was formally announced that the original 1986 lineup was reforming to write, record and release all-new material. This lineup consists of vocalist Jeff Perlin, guitarists Carl Porcaro and Don Angellili, bassist Rich McLoughlin and drummer Anthony Drago. This is the first time in 25 years that this lineup has performed together. Releases Formed in 1987 in Yonkers, NY. Breakdown released a demo (cassette) in 1987, as well as a track on the definitive NYHC compilation, Revelation Records' New York City Hardcore: The Way It Is and the equally important Blackout Records' Where the Wild Things Are compilation. The \\"'87 Demo\\" was eventually released as a 7\\" EP (Blackout/Noiseville), but did not include all of the songs that were available on the original cassette demo. Breakdown also recorded several demos over the years, including \\"Running Scared\\" cassette. Notable releases include the classic EP Blacklisted (Eyeball Records) along with the popular Plus Minus LP (Eyeball Records) and not as well-received Battle Hymns for an Angry Planet LP (Thorp Records/I Scream Records). Breakdown performed at least four live sets on Crucial Chaos, WNYU's hardcore radio show between 1987 and 1994. Dead Serious Records has re-released the demo 7 with a modified artwork. This 7 re- release was a part of the NYHC HALL OF FAME series. The notorious Lost & Found Records also released a semi-unauthorized bootleg of their material entitled \\"Dissed and Dismissed\\".

Its boundaries are Lowry Avenue North to the north, the Mississippi River to the east, West Broadway to the south, and Emerson Avenue North to the west. The neighborhood is named in honor of 19th Century American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Demographics Based on Census 2000 figures, the neighborhood's ethnic makeup changed significantly between 1980 and 2000. All ethnic groups except whites and American Indians increased in number. The white population dropped from 85 percent of the population in 1980 to 19 percent in 2000. During that same time period, the black population increased from 5 percent to 50 percent, and the Asian population grew from less than 1 percent to 17 percent. The Census 2000 also indicated that children and adolescents increased by almost 30 percent, and the school-age population in particular (5 to 17 years old) grew by 93 percent. In 2000, Hawthorne saw nearly 3 percent fewer adults and 60 percent fewer senior residents than in 1980. As a result, the total population decreased slightly. The neighborhood has an average of 3.4 people living in each house in Hawthorne. The median income is $21,865 per year. Hawthorne Area Community Council The Hawthorne Area Community Council was originally established in the 1970s as a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization serving the 6,000 residents in the Hawthorne area neighborhood. The board of directors is composed of representatives from 4 quadrants as well as at-large, non-profit, youth and business representatives who are elected for their terms during the annual meeting typically held in the Fall at Farview Park. The organization's staff size has varied over the years. The Hawthorne Area Community Council works on active programs of community engagement. The primary newsletter is the Hawthorne Vibe that is published on a quarterly basis by the organization. The Hawthorne neighborhood is also the home of Farview Park, the oldest park of Minneapolis, the Nellie Stone Johnson School, and the Orvin Olson Park near the Mississippi River.

It received its world premiere Off-Broadway at the Wings Theatre in New York City. The play itself uses historical evidence and imagined circumstances to depict the rise of early Hollywood film star Ram√≥n Novarro. While a celebration of Novarro‚Äôs life, the drama is told largely through the perspective of reporter Herbert Howe. While Barthel places Howe and Novarro in a romantic relationship, it is unknown if such a connection actually existed. Howe did, however, spend a great deal of time with Novarro as his publicist.Herbert Howe - Biography The play also features Alice Terry, Rex Ingram, Irving G. Thalberg, Jim Quirk, Adela Rogers St. Johns, and Louis B. Mayer as characters.  Synopsis  The play opens with journalist Adela Rogers St. Johns and Jim Quirk, editor of Photoplay magazine, discussing Herbert Howe‚Äôs latest article and his general reputation around Hollywood as an ace reporter willing to do nearly anything to get an interview or story. Howe enters, and after a brief discussion about the tactics Howe implements to get his stories, St. Johns and Quirk leave. Tracy, a new reporter, enters and attempts to seduce Howe so that he might mentor her. She is quickly rebuffed. Howe does, however, give her one piece of advice: to never make any friends. Quirk eventually drops a bomb on Howe: That the bosses at MGM want him to follow around new star Ram√≥n Novarro and help promote Rex Ingram‚Äôs latest film, The Arab. Howe seems hesitant, but at the insistence of Quirk and thanks to a hefty paycheck from the studio, he agrees. Howe eventually meets Novarro as their ship is ready to depart for Tunisia. At first the pair do not seem to get along, but Howe is impressed with Novarro‚Äôs poise and confidence. After a very brief courtship, the two men become an item. On location Rex Ingram directs Novarro and his wife, Alice Terry in The Arab. While all four individuals are friends, Howe becomes frustrated with the long hours Novarro spends on set and his willingness to do whatever Ingram demands of him. Meanwhile, back in California, St. Johns tells Terry that Howe‚Äôs latest articles are unlike anything she‚Äôs seen from the writer. They are complementary. The play cuts back to Tunisia where Ingram and Howe come to blows over Novarro‚Äôs schedule, and eventually Ingram relents and lets the two spend more time together. As the articles continue down the path of homosexual innuendo, L.B. Mayer grows agitated. ‚ÄúBoy Wonder‚Äù Irving G. Thalberg seems more relaxed and understanding of the situation, but agrees to ask Howe to tone things down. The first act ends with Novarro learning that he has been selected to play the lead in the epic film Ben-Hur, implying that he is about to become very famous. The second act opens with a sympathetic St. Johns warning Howe that Novarro‚Äôs career is on the rise and his life very public. Quirk infuriates Terry, who was covering for Howe in his absence, by demoting her to covering small stories. Howe meets with Novarro who is busy preparing for a press conference and expresses dismay that he can never be close to him in public. A shouting match ensues in front of a few crewmembers that threatens to blow their ‚Äúcover.‚Äù Novarro, desperate, punches Howe in the face and then runs into his dressing room. Howe becomes uncharacteristically tender and offers his support. Novarro then has a miserable time on the set of Ben- Hur. The director calls him a ‚Äústupid Mexican.‚Äù Novarro is almost killed filming the chariot race and is shown to have large bruises up and down one side of his body. Howe becomes infuriated and Novarro is desperate to leave and see Ingram. Howe agrees to assist in his boyfriend‚Äôs escape. Production on the film shuts down immediately and Mayer becomes infuriated while Thalberg becomes panicked. Novarro and Howe show up and Rex Ingram‚Äôs house for cover. Thalberg is able to convince the pair to return to the film set, giving increased power to Novarro. Unfortunately, an article written by an anonymous author has revealed the relationship and exposed their romantic entanglement, threatening to end Novarro‚Äôs career. Quirk informs Howe that Mayer wants to see him at MGM studios and the two of them arrive in the movie mogul‚Äôs office. Quirk defends his star reporter, but Mayer grows furious and demands an end to their relationship. Thalberg agrees to let Howe end it his own way, which the reporter reluctantly does. One of the final scenes shows Novarro telling Alice Terry that he was going to break up with Howe as well. Back in his office, Howe concludes that Terry wrote the article in order to get his job. He compliments her on her style, and says that he needs to get out of the business. The final scene shows all the characters reading excerpts from Howe‚Äôs articles on Novarro. Original production The original production of Through a Naked Lens opened on December 16, 2005 at the Wings Theatre and ran for 28 performances. It closed on January 21, 2006.

He grew up in Denver, and graduated from Denver's South High School in 1981. After graduating high school, Lavine headed to the Pacific Northwest and attended The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, graduating in 1985. He then moved to New York City, attending Parsons School of Design, where he received a B.F.A.. While in the state of Washington, Lavine became one of the \\"photographers of record\\" of the then nascent grunge music scene. His first work on a record was the front cover of Psycho-Head Blowout by White Zombie in 1987.\\"Grunge by Michael Lavine\\". January 2010, cited June 11, 2010 His personal friendships with Kurt Cobain and other members of the group Nirvana gave him unparalleled access to create a visual record of that iconic group. He also photographed other grunge era bands such as White Zombie, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Monster Magnet, Sonic Youth and The Flaming Lips. Many of his photographs from this era were compiled in a 1996 Simon & Schuster book entitled Noise From the Underground. One of Lavine's most well known photographs is the cover for the CD Life After Death by The Notorious B.I.G., which was released fifteen days after Biggie's murder. The black-and-white photograph features Wallace (Biggie) standing alongside a black funeral hearse. In hindsight many saw this as portending his death. In another black-and-white photograph from the same shoot, Wallace is standing in front of row after row of headstones in a graveyard. Since 1988, Lavine has been photographing music and entertainment performers, landscapes, politicians and artists, as well as daily American life and everyday people. His style of bold saturated colors, dynamic and extreme use of lighting, and his awareness of what works graphically and what doesn‚Äôt, have made him a sought after photographer. He has also received awards from Communication Arts' Photography and Advertising Annual each year since 1992, as well as from American Photography, the Art Director's Club and Photo District News. Lavine currently resides in Brooklyn neighborhood with his wife, Laurie Henzel and two daughters, Olive and Penny.

Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie. Volume 1. 1875-1912. ‚Äì 16 January 1827) was a learned German jurist. Biography He was born in Paris, and educated by his father until 1789, when he went to G√∂ttingen, where he applied himself to the study of law and history under professors Runde, Hugo, Putter, and Spittler. In 1794, he was elected professor of law at Herborn (Nassau), and two years later he married a daughter of Adam Hoffman, professor of medicine. While he was at Herborn, he received offers from six universities; none of which he accepted, because his aged parents, who lived with him, were opposed to moving, and his wife at Herborn was surrounded by her family. He was a very prolific author at this period, as may be seen by a reference to Meussel's Gelehrtes Deutschland. His writings were varied: sometimes translations from English works, etc.; but chiefly legal treatises and papers relative to civil law, legislation, etc. In 1802, he accepted the situation of counsellor to the newly erected court of appeal at Hadamar, an office which he filled at D√ºsseldorf, during the disturbances of Nassau; but being recalled, in 1811, to the service of the duke of Nassau, he became vice-director of the aulic tribunal of Wiesbaden, and referendary of the minister of state. In 1813, being made member of the commission of legislation, he applied himself to the framing several useful legal reforms, most of which have since been adopted. In 1816, he was made vice-president of the aulic tribunal of Dillenburg; and shortly afterwards, he was named counsellor of state. He had for a long time pleaded the cause of the widowed duchess of Anhalt-Schaumburg (as guardian of her children) against the duke of Anhalt-Bernburg, in a question relative to the validity of the transference of some property; and the course of the suit requiring his presence at Berlin, he went there in 1819; but the views of the question which he took were not recognized by the tribunals. In consequence, he wrote a history of the Anhalt Suit, in which he made some very severe reflections on Prussian legislation. He was, in consequence of this, condemned in 1822, by the authorities at Berlin, to a year's imprisonment; the disgrace of which sentence, although never carried into effect, affected him so deeply as to cause him wholly to retire from society until his death.

By the mid-1880s Del Valle, with 50 residents, also had three churches, two cotton gins, one general store, one steam gristmill, and one school. The primary crops shipped by farmers in the Del Valle area were cotton and grain. By 1900 Del Valle had 75 residents. About 150 people lived in Del Valle in 1927. The Great Depression hampered the community, which had 25 residents in the early 1930s. In 1942 the Del Valle Army Air Base opened (later renamed Bergstrom Air Force Base), leading to an increase in the area population. In the mid-1940s Del Valle had 125 residents. In the mid-1950s Del Valle had 200 residents. In 1907 the area common school district had two schools. Throughout much of its history Del Valle was served by the Colorado Common School District Number 36 and the Hornsby-Dunlap Common School District. In April 1963 the school district was renamed Del Valle Independent #910. From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, Del Valle's population estimates hovered around 300.

Background Porous inorganic solids have found great utility as catalysts and sorption media because of their large internal surface area, i.e. the presence of voids of controllable dimensions at the atomic, molecular, and nanometer scales. With increasing environmental concerns worldwide, nanoporous materials have become more important and useful for the separation of polluting species and the recovery of useful ones. In recent years there has been great progress in applying environmentally friendly zeolites in heterogeneous reaction catalysis. The reason for their success is related to their specific features in converting molecules having kinetic diameter below 1 nm, but they become inadequate when reactants with sizes above the dimensions of the pores have to be processed. Research efforts to synthesize zeolites with larger pore diameter, high structural stability and catalytic activity have not given the expected results yet. Characteristics The discovery of a new family of mesoporous molecular sieves in the early 1990s by Kuroda et al., known as KSW-1Yanagisawa, T.; Shimizu, T.; Kuroda, K.; Kato, C. Bull. Chem. Soc.

Mesoporous silicates, such as MCM-41 and SBA-15 (the most common mesoporous silicates), are porous silicates with huge surface areas (normally ‚â•1000 m¬≤/g), large pore sizes (2 nm ‚â§ size ‚â§ 20 nm) and ordered arrays of cylindrical mesopores with very regular pore morphology. The large surface areas of these solids increase the probability that a reactant molecule in solution will come into contact with the catalyst surface and react. The large pore size and ordered pore morphology allow one to be sure that the reactant molecules are small enough to diffuse into the pores.

It is officially part of the town of Mexico.  Geography  Texas lies on Little Salmon River, about above the mouth of that river on Lake Ontario, on an east-west section between two bends. Its only major road is New York State Route 104B, which parallels the east-west section of the stream. Chief points of interest include Mexico Point State Park, Salmon Country Marina & Campgrounds, and nearby Derby Hill Bird Sanctuary.  History  In 1790, George Scriba, a merchant of New York City and a German by birth, purchased of land lying between Oneida Lake and Lake Ontario, for the sum of $80,000 (approximately $870,000 in today's money). This purchase, known as \\"Scriba's Patent\\", was bounded on the east by Fish Creek and on the west by the Oswego River, and embraced 14 towns in Oswego County and four towns in Oneida County. Around 1794, Scriba founded the settlement of Vera Cruz at the mouth of Little Salmon Creek (today known as the Little Salmon River), on the shore of Lake Ontario, northeast of Fort Ontario. Scriba built a gristmill, a store, and other buildings, and began an active trade on the lake. While the settlement showed initial promise, a series of disasters including the drowning of the heads of seven households in 1799, the British embargo on American trade prior to the War of 1812, the war itself, and a massive fire in 1820, spelled doom. Soon after the fire, S. P. Robinson established a boat yard and built boats there for five or six years, and later a paper mill and store were conducted for a time. A United States Post Office was established in 1839 but discontinued in 1905. For several years a life-saving station was maintained by the state, but it burned in 1886 and was not rebuilt. The hamlet's name became Texas some time between 1820 and 1860, probably soon after the fire. The present name is after the territory of Texas.  Demographics  Oswego County property tax records show approximately 50 houses in Texas. The population is said to be around 200.

It is seven miles (11 km) southwest of Salem. It was built in 1808, rebuilt in 1864 after a fire, one year after John Hunt Morgan demanded ransom for every Washington County mill to be spared from burning. The mill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was on the list of the Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana's 10 Most Endangered historic places in 2005 and 2006, but was not in 2007 because it received funding for its restoration. Geography The mill is situated in a rocky ravine surrounded by sycamores and maples. It is at one of the highest elevations in Indiana, at above sea level. History Beck's Mill before restoration The site of the mill was originally an Indian burial ground, with the Shawnee and Delaware tribes living nearby. The Indians were presumably displeased when the first white man on the land, George Beck arrived from North Carolina with his sons to the Indiana Territory in 1807, after brief stops in Kentucky. Once establishing a place to live near the future site of his mill and building a primitive shelter, he retrieved the rest of his family, who were living near Louisville, Kentucky, a few months later. While exploring his property, Beck saw a waterfall coming out of a cave while hunting on the property. He quickly decided it would be a perfect place for a mill. This waterfall, which is actually a spring, is the second largest spring in Indiana.Beck's Mill The cave is a mile-long, and provides water throughout the year. The first mill was built in 1808, and was 11 ft x 11 ft stone and log structure. Beck built a small dam uphill west of the mill, which through gravity would create a low head of pressure for water to go through wooden troughs to turn the mill wheel, which was overshot. Some of the stones used for mill were buhr, and were brought to the site from Louisville, but originally from France,. A second mill, built in 1825, was a frame building considerably larger than the first mill, which it replaced. Two carding machines was added in 1828. The current mill was the third one on the property, and was the first to have two stories and furniture manufacturing. The mill in its most active years (1864-1890) ran 24 hours a day, using a turbine/waterwheel combination to turn the grindstones. Families would sometimes wait three days for their corn to be milled at Beck's, forcing a settlement by the mill. Eventually, the modern roller mills far surpassed the capability of gristmills, and urbanization made rural mills difficult to transport to in comparison, causing Beck's Mill to stop operating in 1914. In 1963 a tornado touched down on the property, killing two people. Of the 65 mills that operated in Washington County, it is the only one still standing, and less than 20 still stand in Indiana. However, it was placed on Indiana's 10 Most Endangered List due to water damage and trespassers, some of whom vandalized the mill. Descendants of the original owners owned the mill and the surrounding area until November 2005, when the sixth generation became willing to sell. Restoration Beck's Mill near the end of its restoration Friends of Beck's Mill, a nonprofit organization, was given the and building by Donald & Joyce Andersen (Joyce being a direct descendant of the George Beck family). This gift was the results of the efforts and negotiation of D.Jack Mahuron of Salem, with the hope that the mill could be saved, and maybe even become operational as the centerpiece of a local park. Mahuron had worked on getting the restoration started for several years, since the owner Estel Larue Allen died in 1982. In June 2006, a member of the Friends, won a $1,000 door prize from the Washington County Community Foundation, an annual giveaway for use of community projects, and chose to use the $1,000 to start an Endowment [Acorn Fund] for the mill. The fund created a permanent endowment to market and operate the mill. John Hawkins, an architect from Jeffersonville, Indiana, calculated that $600,000 would be required to restore the mill, with additional funds needed to reopen it.

(This 70 plus acres has since been purchased-from the Andersen's in 2012 by Gayle Cook and presented to the Friends). across the road from the mill are used for parking at no cost to the Friends of Beck's Mill. William and Gayle Cook, billionaire philanthropists, made a large donation of approximately $1,200,000.00 in 2007 to begin the restoration process. Jack Mahuron had served on the Board of Advisers of IU Southeast with Bill Cook and knew that he and Gayle were interested in Beck's Mill. They had visited it several times over the years. Jack contacted him at Bloomington asking him to assist with the restoration. He graciously declined because he was busy with the restoration of French Lick and West Baden Hotels. A few months later, however, on March 1, 2007, he sent his Architect George Ridgway and his contractor Joe Pritchett of Pritchett Brothers, to a meeting of the Friends, it was announced that billionaire Bill and Gayle Cook would fund the restoration if the Friends would accept the offer. Restoration of the mill began in earnest in May 2007 with Tracy Wells as foreman of the project for Pritchett Brothers. The first task was to remove the old equipment, tools, and the remaining features of the general store and fabric-making, including two carding machines. The old turbines were cleaned, and the stone foundation was repaired by lifting the mill from its moorings. In September 2007 the outside work was stopped for the year. The mill workings, currently held in storage at Salem, were re-installed in the spring 2008. A grand opening of the mill is planned for the fall of 2008, in time for the 200th anniversary of the first Beck's Mill. The Washington County Chamber of Commerce gave their 2007 Citizen of the Year award to the Friends, due to the restoration of the mill. There is some fear that restoration of the mill by using cave water may affect the ecology of the cave, in particular its blind fish. Beck's Mill is set to be reopened for the public on September 20, 2008, to coincide with the Old Settler's Days festival in Salem.News & Events Friends of Beck's Mill, accessed September 2, 2008 Upon completion of the restoration, Jack Mahuron, the primary supporter and fund raiser for the restoration and a member of the Hoosier Hikers Council of Martinsville, Indiana, asked the hiking group to come in and build walking trails. Suzanne Mittenthal, executive Director of the group brought in several of the members for the work. Over a three-year period and on weekends the hikers built over three mile of trails for the public to use and enjoy Sinking Spring, the bluffs, the Quarry and the natural beauty of the park. The restoration of a 200-year-old log cabin has also been in progress on the hill in back of the Mill. The cabin was completed by member Raymond Lee in the fall of 2011, with most of the funds for the cabin restoration coming from the Paul Ogle Foundation of Jeffersonville. Settlement Country store at Beck's Mill, Indiana After the Pigeon Roost Massacre in 1812, the Becks built two small forts on the property to protect against Indians, and perhaps also due to Indians stealing three barrels of whiskey from George Beck. The new protection began to draw new residents. In 1814 the settlement of Beck's Mill was in consideration to be the county seat of Washington County, only for Salem to eventually get the coveted position. Today the settlement, a few yards uphill from the mill, is the crossroad of Beck's Mill Road and Old Vincennes trail, with a former fire station and country store being its main signs of civilization. The Stage Coach stop from New Albany, Indiana was also located at the SW corner and is still standing. The Beck's Hill store has been reopened and is owned and operated by Bill and Annie Smith. It is operated as an old general store and museum. Food is also served, the menu consists of soups, sandwiches and soft ice cream. An extremely old dwelling on the SE adjoining the store and also belonging to Smith's is being restored. Beck's Mill Bridge Beck's Mill Bridge On September 20, 2007, the bridge by the mill, referred to by the NRHP as the Beck's Mill Bridge, or Washington County Bridge # 105, was placed on the National Register separately. It's a concrete arch bridge designed by Daniel Luten, a noted engineer from Indiana known for his work on elastic theory, for arch bridges. The bridge is scheduled to be restored in 2017.

The higher the lighting ratio, the higher the contrast of the image; the lower the ratio, the lower the contrast. Since the lighting ratio is the ratio of the light levels on the brightest lit to the least lit parts of the subject, and the brightest lit are lit by both key (K) and fill (F), therefore the lighting ratio is properly (K+F):F although for contrast ratios of 4:1 or more, then K:F is sufficiently accurate. Light can be measured in footcandles. A key light of 100 footcandles and a fill light of 100 footcandles have a 1:1 ratio (a ratio of one to one). A keylight of 800 footcandles and a fill light of 200 footcandles has a ratio of 4:1. The ratio can be determined in relation to F stops since each increase in f-stop is equal to double the amount of light: 2 to the power of the difference in f stops is equal to the first factor in the ratio. For example, a difference in two f-stops between key and fill is 2 squared, or 4:1 ratio. A difference in 3 stops is 2 cubed, or an 8:1 ratio. No difference is equal to 2 to the power of 0, for a 1:1 ratio. In situations such as motion picture lighting sometimes the lighting ratio is described as key plus fill to fill alone.

In 1998, Atari Games re-released the game as part of one machine called Area 51/Maximum Force Duo that also included Area 51,Area 51/Maximum Force Duo Videogame by Atari Games (1998) - The International Arcade Museum and the KLOV and later ported the game to both the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn game consoles. Like its predecessor Area 51, Maximum Force uses digitized video stored on an on-board hard disk, and red gibs into which every enemy blows apart when shot, in exactly the same way. While enemies, innocents, and explosions are 2D digitized video sprites, the levels and vehicles are pre-rendered in 3D. Released into markets increasingly dominated by games with polygon graphics, Maximum Force was a critical failure but a commercial success. Gameplay The player(s) play the role of an unnamed counter-terrorist agent who engages in three major combat zones. These areas are under siege by terrorists and the player must kill the terrorists before they take aim and fire at the player character. Shooting hostages or getting shot by terrorists causes the player to lose lives. After four hits are taken, the player must refill their credits or the game is over. Players can have a maximum of seven lives in the home versions. There are several power-ups in the game, such as rapid-fire mode (which is indicated by a spinning assault rifle bullet) for the player's gun or a powerful single-shot mode (which is indicated by a spinning shotgun shell). Shooting windows, barrels, cars, and other objects increases the player's score. Development The game made its world debut on January 21, 1997 at the Amusement Trades Exhibition International show in London. Reception Maximum Force was a moderate success in arcades. Next Generation reviewed the arcade version of the game, and stated that \\"Maximum Force puts a new face on the same old game, and while it's tempting to say that it gets away with it, in the end, it really just doesn't.\\" The home console versions also met with mediocre reviews. Critics overwhelmingly remarked that digitized light gun shooting was overfamiliar or even outdated, though some added that Maximum Force was superior to most games in that style, including Area 51. In particular, they praised the sound effects and the smoothly animated video with natural-feeling transitions between locations. Sega Saturn Magazine elaborated, \\"The video backgrounds move very smoothly, and the baddies actually seem to fit in with the rest of the graphics, rather than looking as if they've been stuck in as an afterthought. The only problem with having this graphics system is the way the enemies are killed - the big splodge of red cartoon blood ...\\" However, many critics also remarked that the 30-minute length, while decent by arcade standards, was unacceptably short for a home console game, and that the lack of alternate routes to choose from leaves Maximum Force with little replay value. Most reviews assessed the game as overall bland compared to the alternatives, with IGN stating that \\"Maximum Force isn't as bad as Revolution X or some of the other ones floating around, but it's no Time Crisis either.\\" Jeff Gerstmann commented in GameSpot that it \\"simply falls short. Gamers will be better served by picking up Virtua Cop 2 or even Die Hard Trilogy.\\" Shawn Smith of Electronic Gaming Monthly summarized, \\"I suppose if you take this game for what it is (a standard B-movie type gun game), then it's not half bad. But if you're looking for something more serious, along the lines of a Virtua Cop 2, then you shouldn't even consider it.\\"  See also  *Target: Terror References  External links  * Maximum Force at GameFAQs * Maximum Force at Giant Bomb * Maximum Force at Killer List of Videogames * Maximum Force at MobyGames Category:1997 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Atari arcade games Category:Light gun games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Rail shooters Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with digitized sprites Category:Video games with pre- rendered 3D graphics ","title":"Maximum Force"},{"id":"7074912","text":"Louis Alm√©ras (1798) Baron Louis Alm√©ras (15 March 1768 in Vienne, Is√®re ‚Äì 7 January 1828 in Bordeaux) was a French general.

Applications Although BF4‚àí has high ionic mobility, solutions of its Li+ salt are less conductive than other less associated salts. As an electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries, LiBF4 offers some advantages relative to the more common LiPF6. It exhibits greater thermal stability and moisture tolerance. For example, LiBF4 can tolerate a moisture content up to 620 ppm at room temperature whereas LiPF6 readily hydrolyzes into toxic POF3 and HF gases, often destroying the battery's electrode materials. Disadvantages of the electrolyte include a relatively low conductivity and difficulties forming a stable solid electrolyte interface with graphite electrodes.

It extended from the western side of Strathaven Road to the western extremity of the Parish of Hamilton.  Etymology  Sir John Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland attributes Earnock to the Celtic Earnogg, ‚Äúthe old son‚Äôs possessions‚Äù (Sinclair 1791) while Stothers suggests alternatively ‚ÄòIreland‚Äô (Stothers nd). James Johnston's Place-names of Scotland postulates a Gaelic etymology, from earr an achaidh \\"end/boundary of the field\\". (Johnston 1892)  History  Earnock was originally part of the grant of Cadzow to Walter fitz Gilbert (progenitor of the Hamiltons of Cadzow) in 1314. It was received by the progenitor of the Roberton family, Robert de Robertoun, by feudal charter from either Malcolm IV or William I between 1160-1200 (Beverage nd) The Robertouns were feudal Lairds of Earnock from prior to 1226 ‚Äì 1296 and 1390 - c 1700. ( The family were dispossessed for signing the Ragman Roll (Rampant Scotland). Simon Robertoun regained Earnock through marriage to a daughter of David fitz Walter of Cadzow (Beverage nd) (Nesbitt A nd) ). It was sold by James Roberton, 12th Laird of Earnock, to a Mr Semple at the turn of the 19th century. He in turn sold the property to A. Millar, Esq., in 1810. Earnockmuir, part of the original estate was inherited by Sir William Erskine Cochrane,(Hamilton Advertiser 1874) (brother of Lord Dundonald) great grandson of the last Laird of Earnock. He sold it along with part of Annesfield Farm to a Mr Dixon sometime after his retirement in 1819 (Philippart 1820) Upon Millar‚Äôs death his married sister Mrs Williams inherited it, and sold it to Sir John Watson, baronet. None of the Robertons‚Äô house remains although it is said \\" the great hall was beautifully decorated with armorial bearings of the Robertons, and that the fireplace was remarkable for its carving.\\" (Hamilton Advertiser 1943) Watson and his descendants built a mansion upon the site. (Hamilton Advertiser 1943) Electric light was introduced to the house in 1881 although the town of Hamilton did not receive electricity until 1903. The house was sold in 1925 and demolished in 1926. (Stothers nd)  Overseas  When John Roberton of Glasgow settled in New Zealand in the 19th century he named his Takapuna property \\"Earnock\\", after the family estate in Scotland.(Rae 1992) The house, a white weather-board structure, still stands on Hustmere Road, Takapuna. It is used as a hair dressing salon. References # Sinclair, J Statistical Accounts of Scotland 1791 - 99 Volume 2 p 210 # Stothers, nd.

Background After the Mukden Incident, the Japanese Kwantung Army quickly overran the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, occupying major cities and railways. At that time, the Chairman Wan Fulin of Heilongjiang Province was in Beijing, leaving the provincial government leaderless. Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the Kuomintang government in Nanjing for instructions, and then appointed General Ma Zhanshan as acting Chairman and Military Commander-in-chief of Heilongjiang Province on October 16, 1931. General Ma Zhanshan arrived in the capital Qiqihar on October 19 and took office the next day. He held military meetings and personally inspected the defense positions while facing down parties who wished to surrender, saying ‚ÄúI am appointed as Chairman of the Province, and I have the responsibility to defend the Province and I will never be a surrendering general\\". Resistance at Nenjiang Bridge In November 1931, General Ma Zhanshan chose to disobey the Kuomintang government's ban on further resistance to the Japanese invasion and attempted to prevent Japanese forces from crossing into Heilongjiang province by defending a strategic railway bridge across the Nen River near Jiangqiao. This bridge had been dynamited earlier by Ma's forces during the fighting against pro-Japanese collaborationist forces of General Zhang Haipeng. A repair crew, guarded by 800 Japanese soldiers, went to work on 4 November 1931, but fighting soon erupted with the 2,500 Chinese troops nearby. Each side charged the other with opening fire without provocation. The skirmish continued for over three hours, until the Japanese drove General Ma's troops off toward Qiqihar. Later General Ma Zhanshan returned to counterattack with a much larger force. Japanese Major General Shogo Hasebe, had the sluggish river on his left, the railway on his right. Wide swamplands made the Japanese left wing impregnable, forcing Ma to concentrate his cavalry against the exposed Japanese right wing. Although dislodging the Japanese from their advance positions, Ma was unable to recapture the bridge, which the Japanese continued to repair. Ma was eventually forced to withdraw his troops in the face of Japanese tanks and artillery. Ma became a national hero for his resistance to the Japanese which was widely reported in the Chinese and international press. The publicity inspired more volunteers to enlist in the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies.Coogan, Northeast China and the Origins of the Anti-Japanese United Front, pp.283-314 Battle of Qiqihar On November 15, 1931, despite having lost more than 400 killed and 300 wounded since November 5, General Ma declined a Japanese ultimatum to surrender Qiqihar. On the November 17, in subzero weather, 3,500 Japanese troops of the 2nd division, under the command of General Jiro Tamon, mounted an attack on Qiqihar's 8,000 defenders along a five-mile front on the heights of San-chien-fang south of Tangchi. Japanese cavalry charged down the Chinese front line cutting a swath into which Japanese infantry followed. Ma's right flank held at first. The Chinese cavalry tried to encircle the Japanese right flank, but were stopped by Japanese artillery and close air support. The superior Japanese firepower turned the battle. Chinese units broke and fled across the frozen steppes. On November 18, Ma evacuated Qiqihar. By November 19, he led his troops to the east to defend Baiquan and Hailun. His forces had suffered serious casualties and their strength was now much reduced. However once Ma was forced to retire up the Nonni River valley, he managed to regroup his forces and maintain their morale. Japanese troops attempting to press Ma's men further up the Nonni River towards Koshen in the cold suffered large casualties on several occasions. At the same time the Japanese began their occupation of Qiqihar, securing control of all three Manchurian provincial capitals. At Mukden and Kirin the Japanese had already established collaborationist Chinese governments. At Qiqihar they established another government under pro-Japanese General Zhang Jinghui. Japan also secured control of the central section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, however, the eastern section was still under the control of General Ting Chao in Harbin.Matsuzaka, The Making of Japanese Manchuria, 1904-1932  See also  *Second Sino-Japanese War *Mukden Incident References   External links  *Ma Zhanshan *Notes On A Guerrilla Campaign *Two War Lords, Time Magazine Nov. 16, 1931 *Hero Ma, Time Magazine Nov. 23, 1931 *Rout of Ma, Time Magazine Nov. 30, 1931 Topographic maps of campaign area. * Chi-chi-ha-erh nl51-2 San-chien-fang ‰∏âÈó¥Êàø area, Angangxi, Qiqihar * Wang-yeh-miao nl51-5 Nenjiang Bridge area Notes Category:Conflicts in 1931 Category:Battles of the Second Sino-Japanese War Category:1931 in China Category:History of Manchuria Category:1931 in Japan Category:History of Heilongjiang Category:November 1931 events ","title":"Jiangqiao Campaign"},{"id":"7075130","text":"The Kolej Vokasional Shah Alam (formerly known as Sekolah Menengah Teknik Shah Alam and Sekolah Menengah Vokasional Shah Alam) is a public vocational college that specialises in engineering and vocational training.

He was appointed to that position on 26 February 1993 when the former Chief Justice Austin Asche took up appointment as Administrator of the Northern Territory. Chief Justice Martin was appointed as a Judge of the Court in 1987 and, following his retirement, still assists the Court as an Acting Judge having been appointed to that position in 2004. He was unusually succeeded as Chief Justice by a person bearing the same first name and surname, Justice Brian Ross Martin. The two men are distinguished by their middle names. The judgments of the latter appear as Martin (BR) CJ to eliminate confusion. Education and pre-Northern Territory Chief Justice Martin was born in Lithgow, New South Wales in 1936 and attended the Lithgow High School. He commenced studying law in 1953 and was admitted to practice in 1959. He practised as a solicitor in Sydney from 1959 - 1963. Legal career In pursuit of establishing a country law practice, he moved to Alice Springs in 1963 and, along with Ian Barker, was one of only two solicitors in the town at that time. Together they established the firm of Martin and Barker. He was to stay at Alice Springs until 1981. While there he was appointed to the Alice Springs Town Management Board and served there from 1968 - 1971. He also served terms as Alderman, Deputy Mayor and Mayor between 1972 and 1975. He was an inaugural member of the Northern Territory Law Society when it was formed in 1968 and was the Alice Springs representative from 1970 to 1977 and its Vice-President from 1972 - 1973. In 1978 Chief Justice Martin chaired a committee established by the new Northern Territory Government to inquire into the welfare needs of the Northern Territory. In 1980 he was appointed to chair a Committee of Inquiry into pastoral land tenure in the Northern Territory. He was also appointed that year to the Board of Directors of the Australian Bicentennial Authority and was Chairman of the Northern Territory Council of the Authority until 1989. Chief Justice Martin was appointed as Northern Territory Solicitor-General and Secretary of the Department of Law in 1981 and relocated to Darwin. In 1982 he was appointed as a Queen's Counsel and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. He resigned as Secretary of the Department of Law on 3 May 1986 but stayed on as Solicitor-General until he was appointed as a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory on 30 September 1987. He was appointed as an Officer of the Order of Australia in 1989. As Chief Justice he was a strong defender of the independence of the judiciary and was an even stronger supporter of the Independent Bar. He was the first Northern Territory Chief Justice to use technology such as the internet to display sentencing remarks. He also oversaw the introduction of videoconferencing and implemented the first regular sittings of the Court at Katherine. During his time as Chief Justice he was Chairman of the Northern Territory Parole Board and held a commission as Acting Administrator of the Territory. He retired on 31 October 2003 and still lives in Darwin.

Derivation of the word Etymology The word mere is recorded in Old English as mere ‚Ä≥sea, lake‚Ä≥, corresponding to Old Saxon meri, Old Low Franconian *meri (Dutch meer ‚Ä≥lake, pool‚Ä≥, Picard mer ‚Ä≥pool, lake‚Ä≥, Northern French toponymic element -mer), Old High German mari / meri (German Meer ‚Ä≥sea‚Ä≥), Goth. mari-, marei, Old Norse marr ‚Ä≥sea‚Ä≥ (Norwegian mar ‚Ä≥sea‚Ä≥, Shetland Norn mar ‚Ä≥mer, deep water fishing qarea‚Ä≥, Faroese marrur ‚Ä≥mud, sludge‚Ä≥, Swedish place name element mar-, French mare ‚Ä≥pool, pond‚Ä≥). They derive from reconstituted Proto-Germanic *mari, itself from Indo-European *mori, the same root as marsh and moor. The Indo-European root *mori gave also birth to similar words in other European languages: Latin mare, ‚Ä≥sea‚Ä≥ (Italian mare, Spanish mar, French mer); Old Celtic *mori, ‚Ä≥sea‚Ä≥ (Gaulish mori-, more, Irish muir, Welsh m√¥r, Breton mor); and Old Slavic morje.English Etymology, T. F. Hoad, Oxford University PressDas Herkunftsw√∂rterbuch, Duden Band 7, Dudenverlag. Signification Windermere (viewed from the north: about grid reference NY4003). The word once included the sea or an arm of the sea in its range of meaning but this marine usage is now obsolete (OED). It is a poetical or dialect word meaning a sheet of standing water, a lake or a pond (OED). The OED fourth definition (\\"A marsh, a fen.\\") includes wetland such as fen amongst usages of the word which is reflected in the lexicographers' recording of it. In a quotation from the year 598, mere is contrasted against moss (bog) and field against fen. The OED quotation from 1609 does not say what a mere is, except that it looks black. In 1629 mere and marsh were becoming interchangeable but in 1876 mere was \\"heard, at times, applied to ground permanently under water\\": in other words, a very shallow lake. The online edition of the OED quoted examples relate to: #the sea: Old English to 1530: 7 quotations #standing water: Old English to 1998: 22 quotations #arm of the sea: 1573 to 1676: 4 quotations #marsh or fen: 1609 to 1995: 7 quotations Characteristics Where land similar to that of Martin Mere, gently undulating glacial till, becomes flooded and develops fen and bog, the remnants of the original mere remain until the whole is filled with peat. This can be delayed where the mere is fed by lime-rich water from chalk or limestone upland and a significant proportion of the outflow from the mere takes the form of evaporation. In these circumstances, the lime (typically calcium carbonate) is deposited on the peaty bed and inhibits plant growth, therefore, peat formation. A typical feature of these meres is that they are alongside a river rather than having the river flowing through them. In this way, the mere is replenished by seepage from the bed of the lime-rich river, through the river's natural lev√©e, or by winter floods. The water of the mere is then static through the summer, when the concentration of the calcium carbonate rises until it is precipitated on the bed of the mere. Even quite shallow lake water can develop a thermocline in the short term but where there is a moderately windy climate, the circulation caused by wind drift is sufficient to break this up. (The surface is blown down-wind in a seiche and a return current passes either near the bottom or just above the thermocline if that is present at a sufficient depth.) This means that the bed of the shallow mere is aerated and bottom-feeding fish and wildfowl can survive, providing a livelihood for people around. Expressed more technically, the mere consists entirely of the epilimnion. This is quite unlike Windermere where in summer, there is a sharp thermocline at a depth of 9 to 15 metres, well above the maximum depth of 60 metres or so. (M&W; p36) At first sight, the defining feature of a mere is its breadth in relation to its shallow depth. This means that it has a large surface in proportion to the volume of water it contains. However, there is a limiting depth beyond which a lake does not behave as a mere since the sun does not warm the deeper water and the wind does not mix it. Here, a thermocline develops but where the limiting dimensions lie is influenced by the sunniness and windiness of the site and the murkiness of the water. This last usually depends on how eutrophic (rich in plant nutrients) the water is. Nonetheless, in general, with the enlargement of the extent of a mere, the depth has to become proportionately less if it is to behave as a mere.

As at Martin Mere in Lancashire, when the fens were being drained to convert the land to pasture and arable agriculture, the meres went too but some are easily traced owing to the characteristic soil. For the reasons given above, it is rich in both calcium carbonate and humus. On the ground, its paleness stands out against the surrounding black, humic soils and on the soil map, the former meres show as patches of the Willingham soil association, code number 372 (Soil Map). Apart from those drained in the medieval period, they are shown in Saxton's map of the counties (as they were in his time) of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire. The following is a list of known meres of the eastern English Fenland with their grid references. Saxton's meres are named as: *Trundle Mere TL2091 *Whittlesey Mere TL2291 *Stretham Mere TL5272 *Soham Mere. TL5773 *Ug Mere TL2487 *Ramsey Mere TL3189 In Jonas Moor's \\"map of the Great Levell of the Fenns\\" of 1720, though Trundle Mere is not named, the above are all named but one, included with the addition of: *Benwick Mere TL3489 In the interval, Stretham Mere had gone and the main features of the modern drainage pattern had appeared. Ugg, Ramsey and Benwick meres do not show in the soil map. Others which do but which appear to have been drained before Saxton's mapping in 1576 are at: *TL630875 *TL6884 *TL5375 *TL5898 The last appears to be the \\"mare 'Wide' vocatum\\" of Robert of Swaffham's version of the Hereward story (Chapter XXVI). If it is, it will have been in existence in the 1070s, when the events of the story took place. Meres in Wales *Hanmer Mere, Clwyd *Marloes Mere, Pembrokeshire Meres in the Netherlands Meres similar to those of the English Fens but more numerous and extensive used to exist in the Netherlands, particularly in Holland. See Haarlemmermeer, for example. However, the Dutch word meer is used more generally than the English mere. It means \\"lake\\", as also seen in the names of lakes containing meer in Northern Germany, e.g. Steinhuder Meer. When the Zuiderzee was enclosed by a dam and its saltwater became fresh, it changed its status from a sea (zee) to being known as the IJsselmeer, the lake into which the River IJssel flows.

Winners of the contest had the chance to participate in the following year's Empire State Building run-up competition in New York City. Triangular Tower The Azrieli Center Triangular Tower has a height of . Construction of this tower, like the circular tower, began in 1996 and was completed in 1999. It has 46 floors and its main occupant is Bezeq, Israel's largest telecommunications company; Bezeq occupies 13 floors of the tower. The tower's cross-section is an equilateral triangle. Square Tower The Azrieli Center Square Tower was completed in June 2007. The tower has 42 floors, and is 154m high. It is the shortest of the three towers in the Azrieli complex. Construction of the third tower was stopped in 1998 due to urban planning disagreements and was resumed in 2006. The lower 13 floors house Africa Israel's Crowne Plaza business hotel. The upper floors are used as office space. Shopping center The Azrieli Center Mall is one of the largest in Israel. There are about 30 restaurants, fast- food counters, cafes and food stands in the mall. The top floor of the mall is a popular hangout spot for teens, and many online message boards arrange get- togethers there during national holidays. Due to high, constant terrorism threats, the Azrieli towers are guarded to deter terrorist action, like many buildings in Israel. Other features The large complex boasted an 8-screen cinema until 2010, when H&M; took over the space. Azrieli also features a large fitness club, night schools, a small kid-focused amusement park and a pedestrian bridge leading to Tel Aviv HaShalom Railway Station. A second pedestrian bridge, completed on March 2003, connects the Azrieli Center with the other side of Begin Road and HaKirya. It is expected that a connection between Kaplan underpass and the project's underground carpark, which is one of the largest ever built in the region, will be constructed. When completed, the plot which the Center occupies will offer a 400-seat, open air auditorium. Access The Azrieli Center is bordered by the Ayalon Highway that crosses Tel Aviv from North to South, Begin Road and Giv'at HaTahmoshet Street (a short section that connects Kaplan Street with HaShalom Road). It is situated next to the HaShalom Interchange on the Ayalon Highway. The center can be easily accessed from most parts of Israel by train to the Tel Aviv HaShalom Railway Station which is connected to the center by an enclosed pedestrian bridge or by one of the many buses that stop on Begin Road. In addition, the Tel Aviv Arlozorov Bus Terminal is located 1 kilometer north of the complex.  Future Azrieli Tower  The Azrieli Tower is a planned 350 meter high spiral skyscraper which will be incorporated into the Azrieli Center complex. The Azrieli Tower will be the tallest in Israel when completed surpassing the current tallest skyscraper; Azrieli Sarona Tower.

The ventral rami supply the antero-lateral parts of the trunk and the limbs. They are mainly larger than the dorsal rami. Shortly after a spinal nerve exits the intervertebral foramen, it branches into the dorsal ramus, the ventral ramus, and the ramus communicans. Each of these three structures carries both sensory and motor information. Each spinal nerve carries both sensory and motor information, via efferent and afferent nerve fibers - ultimately via the motor cortex in the parietal cortex - but also through the phenomenon of reflex. Spinal nerves are referred to as ‚Äúmixed nerves.‚Äù In the thoracic region they remain distinct from each other and each innervates a narrow strip of muscle and skin along the sides, chest, ribs, and abdominal wall. These rami are called the intercostal nerves. In regions other than the thoracic, ventral rami converge with each other to form networks of nerves called nerve plexuses. Within each plexus, fibers from the various ventral rami branch and become redistributed so that each nerve exiting the plexus has fibers from several different spinal nerves. One advantage to having plexes is that damage to a single spinal nerve will not completely paralyze a limb. There are four main plexuses formed by the ventral rami: the cervical plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves C1-C4. Branches of the cervical plexus, which include the phrenic nerve, innervate muscles of the neck, the diaphragm, and the skin of the neck and upper chest. The brachial plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves C5-T1. This plexus innervates the pectoral girdle and upper limb. The lumbar plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves L1-L4. The sacral plexus contains ventral rami from spinal nerves L4-S4. The lumbar and sacral plexuses innervate the pelvic girdle and lower limbs. Ventral rami, including the sinuvertebral nerve branches, also supply structures anterior to the facet joint, including the vertebral bodies, the discs and their ligaments, and joins other spinal nerves to form the lumbosacral plexus.

He was beatified in 1202. The account of his life, written by his disciple Albert, who lived with him during his last year at Maleval, has been lost. Written accounts of his life by Theodobald, or Thibault, given by the Bollandists, is unreliable because it has been interpolated with the lives of at least two other Williams. After a number of chapters in which he is confused with St. William of Gellone, Duke of Aquitaine, we are told that he went to Rome, where he had an interview with pope Eugene III, who ordered him to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in penance for his sins. Though Theodobald's account of his interview with the pope does not carry conviction, the fact of this visit and his subsequent pilgrimage to Jerusalem is supported by excerpts from the older life, which are preserved by responsories and antiphons in his liturgical feast Office. He seems to have remained at Jerusalem for one or two years, not nine as Theodobald relates. About 1153 he returned to Italy and led a hermit's life in a wood near Pisa, then on Monte Pruno, and finally in 1155 in the desert valley of Stabulum Rodis, later known as Maleval, in the territory of Castiglione della Pescaia, Diocese of Grosseto, where he was joined by Albert.

Career From 1974 to 1983, while working on his doctorate at Harvard, Pelton served as an instructor and teaching fellow in the English Department. After receiving his PhD in 1983, he became Senior Tutor of Winthrop House, one of Harvard's undergraduate colleges. He left Harvard in 1986, to become Dean of Students at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. He served in that capacity until being named Dean of the College in 1988. Pelton left Colgate in 1991, when he was named dean of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.\\"Top Dartmouth Official Is Quitting, the Fourth in Six Months\\", The New York Times, January 7, 1998, p. B7. While at Dartmouth he was responsible for the largest administrative body of the school, and held an academic appointment in the Department of English. In July 1998, Pelton was appointed as the 22nd president of Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, the first university in the western United States. He expanded the faculty with 26 new tenured-track professorships and increased minority enrollment to 24 percent, up from 11 percent when he started. The school built two new buildings, Ford Hall and Kaneko Commons, and purchased several others adjacent to the campus in downtown Salem, and raised $131 million in a fund-raising campaign. At the end of the 2010 academic year Pelton left to take the same position at Emerson College in Massachusetts, replaced at Willamette by Stephen E. Thorsett. Under Pelton‚Äôs leadership since 2011, Emerson College adopted a strategic plan that outlines five guiding strategies for the institution: Academic Excellence, Civic Engagement, Internationalization and Global Engagement, Innovation, and Financial Strength. During Pelton‚Äôs tenure at Emerson, the College enhanced its Emerson Los Angeles program when it established a new physical presence in Hollywood in 2014 by opening a building for learning and living on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. Emerson College played a leading role in the revival of Boston‚Äôs theatre district when it purchased and renovated two leading theatres; the Cutler Majestic Theatre and Paramount Center theatres. The purchase and recent renovation of the historic Emerson Colonial Theatre, which hosted the first performances of Porgy and Bess (1935) and Oklahoma! (1943), among other major productions, cemented Emerson‚Äôs role in the revival of that section of the city. The theatre is now managed in partnership with Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG). In 2018, the College established its Global Portals program on several continents, opening doors for students from around the world to gain an Emerson College degree. An alliance with Marlboro College in Marlboro, VT, a private liberal arts college founded in 1946, was announced in November 2019, with the intention of keeping the legacy of the small liberal arts alive on Emerson‚Äôs Boston campus. Finalized in July 2020, the alliance moved Marlboro‚Äôs academic program, known for its self-directed nature, to Emerson and renamed Emerson‚Äôs liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies program to the Marlboro Institute for Liberal Arts and Interdisciplinary Studies. Existing Marlboro students were invited to matriculate and tenured and tenure-track faculty had the option to teach at Emerson.

While a student at Indiana University in 1968, he and Michael Brecker started a jazz-rock band that performed at the Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival. He was invited to be a member of the backing band for rock singer Janis Joplin, but a throat problem kept him from performing. Despite a successful operation on his throat, he gave up the trumpet, moved to New York City, and played guitar for the next ten years. When he returned to the trumpet, he became a member of the Nighthawks Orchestra led by Vince Giordano, followed by membership in Bechet's Legacy led by Bob Wilber. From 1984‚Äì1985, he was part of Benny Goodman's last band. Sandke remarks in the liner notes to The Subway Ballet: \\"Okay - I worked with Benny Goodman, but so did Fats Navarro and Herbie Hancock and nobody refers to them as 'swing musicians.' ...Being thus labeled is somewhat akin to being called a child molester in that the tag never seems to go away, and both can be equally deleterious to one's career.\\" He has recorded over twenty albums as a leader, ranging from revisitings of music from the 1920s and 1930s to explorations of contemporary idioms in the company Michael Brecker, Kenny Barron, Marty Ehrlich, Bill Charlap, and Uri Caine. He became interested in exploring dissonant, nonstandard harmonies that lie outside of conventional triadic harmony, creating a musical theory of what he calls \\"metatonality\\", a harmonic system outlined in his book Harmony for a New Millennium. He has led the New York All-Stars with Dan Barrett and Ken Peplowski, the Metatonal Band with Marvin Smith and Ted Rosenthal, and has done arrangements for the Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra. His writings include a method book about his \\"metatonal\\" approach to harmony. He has a brother, Jordan Sandke, who is a trumpeter. Both brothers played in the Widespread Depression Jazz Orchestra. His albums include Trumpet After Dark, a jazz-with-strings album that uses Renaissance viols instead of modern violins. Inside Out and Outside In bring together mainstream jazz musicians such as Ken Peplowski and avant-garde jazz musicians Ray Anderson and Uri Caine. His work appeared in the movies The Cotton Club, Bullets over Broadway, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion.

In 1992, it became an NHS Trust, providing 24-hour emergency and healthcare services to more than 2.1million people across the region. Geography WYMAS covered the whole of West Yorkshire, including the cities of Bradford, Leeds, and Wakefield, and the principal towns of Halifax, Huddersfield and Pontefract. In addition, WYMAS' coverage extended into the Craven area of North Yorkshire with ambulance stations at Grassington, Ingleton, Settle and Skipton, covering the western side of North Yorkshire and the Yorkshire Dales. The region included parts of the M1, A1(M), M62, M621 and M606 motorways, and West Yorkshire itself is highly industrial. Neighbouring ambulance services covered Greater Manchester, Lancashire, North Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. There were 21 ambulance stations situated across the WYMAS operating area. Services WYMAS activities were centred on two core activities: Accident & Emergency (A&E;) and patient transport services (PTS). Both covered areas far and wide, from the rural areas around Settle and Skipton in the North or the Holmfirth and Honley stations in the South; to the inner city suburbs of busy Leeds and Bradford, and were controlled from a communication centre located at the Service's headquarters at Birkenshaw, south of Bradford.

History WONU began as a campus radio station, originally called \\"Olivet Radio.\\" It used a carrier current broadcasting system, heard on AM 640 but only in buildings on campus. The station came under the direction of Professor George Snyder. With a staff of only a handful of students, in the first semester on air, 1,000 hours of programming were produced. Around 1951, WONC was discontinued until the 25th reunion of the ONU Class of 1941 raised the funds needed to bring radio broadcasting back to the ONU Campus. As part of this new venture, Olivet alumnus Dr. Ray Moore was brought in from Kansas City to oversee what would become Olivet Nazarene's first FM station, WKOC-FM, broadcasting on 88.3 MHz with a 10-watt mono signal. In January 1967, WKOC-FM officially began broadcasting from studios located on the second floor of Ludwig Hall. Moore returned to Kansas City in 1968, leaving the station in the hands of broadcasting students such as Russ Bredholt. Around the spring of 1971, Moore came back to Olivet to resume as the Director of Broadcasting. By the spring of 1977, from WKOC's inception in 1967, over 250 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio licenses had been granted to Olivet students who successfully completed testing. In 1978, Professor Don Toland became Director of Broadcasting. Included in his tenure was a move from Ludwig Hall to the third floor of Benner Library. WKOC-FM increased to 420 watts in stereo. The station later moved to 89.7 MHz and increased its power to 35,000 watts in stereo. On-air fundraisers were started, known as \\"Share A Thons.\\" They were designed to help Olivet Radio become more self-supporting, with reduced funding from the university. The broadcast day increased to 18 hours. Remote broadcasts for Olivet college football and basketball games began. The station also affiliated with a national news network. Dr. Henry Smith became the Director of Broadcasting during the Summer of 1988. He got the FCC to switch WKOC's call sign to WONU. He began a systemized music playlist and format for both the AM sarrier current station and the FM station. When Dr. Smith began work in the Graduate Studies Department at ONU, his former co-worker at Mt. Vernon Nazarene College's radio station, Professor Bill DeWees, was hired to lead WONU. Professor Carl Fletcher and Professor Brian Utter switched the moniker from \\"Olivet Radio\\" to \\"Shine.FM.\\" New simulcast FM frequencies in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana were added. Shine.FM also added online streaming formats of Spanish music and programming; praise and worship music; and Spark, a music format for young listeners. In August 2010, a station on 89.3 in Morris, Illinois, WUON, was added to the network. On December 28, 2010, WONU began a simulcast broadcast in Lowell, Indiana at 88.5 FM on WTMK- FM, purchased from the Calvary Radio Network. WONU moved the 88.5 signal to Wanatah, on April 7, 2015. WTMK can now be heard in Valparaiso, Indiana. In 2008, some listeners reported static in the signal, due to a new Chicago Public Radio station operating in Chesterton, Indiana on 89.5 under the call sign WBEW. On July 28, 2011, WONU purchased WHZN at 88.3, New Whiteland, Indiana in the Indianapolis media market, from Horizon Christian Fellowship. A secondary studio is located at the First Church of the Nazarene on the east side of Indianapolis. On December 1, 2014, WONU purchased translator W237BY at 95.3 FM in Mason, Michigan in the Lansing radio market from the Educational Media Foundation. The translator is fed locally from WITL HD-2 at 100.7. A power increase on the translator took place on May 13, 2015, increasing its coverage. Concerts WONU promotes and hosts Contemporary Christian concerts in the Kankakee area and on the Olivet Nazarene University campus. In addition to Christian music, WONU also hosts Christian comedians. Teaching Because WONU is owned by Olivet Nazarene University, it is sometimes used as a teaching station. The Bourbonnais studio contains a radio classroom with 20 computer stations for instruction in radio broadcasting. Olivet's communication department employs a full-time radio professor to teach the classes.

The rims of wine glasses filled with water are rubbed by the player's fingers to create the notes. :For the band, see Glass Harp (band) or for the similar instrument, see Glass harmonica. A glass harp (also called musical glasses, singing glasses, angelic organ, verrillon or ghost fiddle) is a musical instrument made of upright wine glasses. It is played by running moistened or chalked fingers around the rim of the glasses. Each glass is tuned to a different pitch, either by grinding each goblet to the specified pitch, in which case the tuning is invariable, or by filling the glass with water until the desired pitch is achieved. History Musical glasses were documented in Persia in the 14th century.Apel, Willi (1969). Harvard Dictionary of Music, p.347. Harvard. . The glass harp was created in 1741 by Irishman Richard Pockrich, who is known as the first virtuoso of the musical glasses. Pockrich called his instrument the \\"angelic organ\\" and it was played with sticks, rather than by rubbing the glasses with a moistened finger. It was reported in 1760 that, \\"Pockrich played Handel's Water Music on the glasses.\\" His successful concert career was brought to a premature end by a fire in which both the inventor and instrument perished in 1759.Sibyl Marcuse, \\"Angelic Organ\\", Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary, corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975). The composer Christoph Willibald Gluck played the musical glasses. He performed in London in 1746, and Copenhagen. His instrument consisted of 26 goblets,Sibyl Marcuse, \\"Musical Glasses\\", Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary, corrected edition, Norton Library N758 (New York: W. W.Norton, 1975). \\"filled with spring water.\\" The instrument was popular in the 18th century. Pockrich's contemporary, Ford, published Instructions for the Playing of the Musical Glasses while Bartl published a German version.P1205; W. A. Mozart; Hermann Abert, Stewart Spencer (translator), Cliff Eisen; Yale University Press, 2007; In 1929 Bruno Hoffmann invented a glass harp consisting, \\"of 46 individually tuned glasses fixed on a resonant table.\\" The Art of Instrumentation Contemporary uses On March 9, 1938, Bruno Hoffmann performed on the glass harp at the London Museum in a program including Mozart's Adagio (K. 356) and Quintet for harmonica, flute, viola, oboe, and cello (K. 617), accompanied by Geoffrey Gilbert, Leon Goossens, Frederick Riddle, and James Whitehead. It was an \\"exquisite performance, in which the flute and viola in their upper registers were almost indistinguishable from the glasses, [which] held spell-bound a large audience, crowded over the floor, stairs and galleries\\".A. Hyatt King, \\"The Musical Glasses and Glass Harmonica\\", Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, 72nd Session (1945‚Äì46): 97‚Äì122. Citation on 119. On February 18, 1979, Gloria Parker performed as a musical glasses soloist with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra at the Jai Alai Fronton in Hartford, Connecticut, USA. Richard Hayman, noted for his arrangements for Boston Pops conductor Arthur Fiedler, was the guest conductor for the 90-piece orchestra that accompanied the musical glasses which included songs such as \\"Lara's Theme\\" from the movie Dr. Zhivago, \\"Lover\\" and \\"Amor\\". There are several current musicians who professionally play the glass harp. Among them are the Glass Duo from Poland, Philipp Marguerre and Clemens Hofinger in Germany, France's Jean Chatillion and Thomas Bloch, Brien Engel, and Dennis James in the United States and Canada's Real Berthiaume. Glasses have been also used by famous rock band Pink Floyd during the recording of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" on their Wish You Were Here album, recorded and released in 1975. Igor Sklyarov played the glass harp on the same song during two 2006 concerts recorded in Venice, Italy by former guitarist David Gilmour. Gilmour also used the effect during his August 26, 2006, concert in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland, with the help of Guy Pratt, Phil Manzanera and Dick Parry. Both recordings are available on Gilmour's Live in Gda≈Ñsk CD, although the Venice recording is only available on the five-disc version of the album or as an internet download with the three- and four-disc versions. A colorful set of water tuned glasses is depicted as being played with a pair of metal sticks in several key scenes of the extremely successful 2009 Korean TV drama Queen Seon Deok, showing the series' main anti-heroine Mishil (Go Hyun-jung) playing her own haunting theme melody Yurijan (Glasses) on that instrument.E.g., minutes 1:04 to 4:37 of scene #6 of the second episode (birth of the future queen Seondeok). *A Toast To Christmas with the Singing Glasses is an album recorded and released in 1980, composed and performed by Gloria Parker. Fourteen well-known carols are performed with the glass harp producing flute-like sounds on crystal glasses, marking the first commercial album to use glasses as a musical instrument. Recently, there have been new advancements in the popular use of the glass harp.

Facilities Henderson High School was the first school constructed to a new common design plan, which were used during the post-World War II period to speed up secondary school construction. The \\"Henderson type school\\" was a single-storey all-timber school design, with long wings of classrooms facing onto corridors, fanning out from a central spine. It was a derivative of the \\"Naenae type school\\" (after its first use at Naenae College in Lower Hutt), which with two stories and mixed concrete and timber construction was too slow for a major school building programme. The Henderson school design lasted four years, 1953 to 1956, before it was replaced in 1957 with a new design centred on self-contained classroom blocks. Other school in the Auckland area built to the Henderson design include One Tree Hill College, Rangitoto College and Selwyn College. The school has a small independently owned and operated tuck shop.

It is located in Divis Street which is the lower section of the Falls Road. It is currently the fifteenth-tallest building in Belfast. History It was built in 1966 as part of the now-demolished Divis Flats complex, which comprised twelve 8-story blocks of terraces and flats, named after the nearby Divis Mountain. The tower, a vertical complex of 96 flats housing approx 110 residents, was designed by architect Frank Robertson for the Northern Ireland Housing Trust. The site on which the Tower stands was previously the site of the Sir Charles Lanyon-designed Falls Road Methodist Church, which opened in 1854 and closed in 1966. The site was sold to Belfast Corporation for approximately ¬£11,000. A television documentary has been made about the tower. Troubles British Army observation post In response to Provisional IRA and INLA activity in the area, the British Army constructed an observation post on the roof in the 1970s and occupied the top two floors of the building. At the height of the Troubles, the Army was only able to access the post by helicopter. Patrick Rooney and Emmanuel McClarnon shootings Divis Tower was a flashpoint area during the height of the Troubles. Nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, the first child killed in the Troubles, was killed in the tower during the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969, when the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) fired a Browning machine gun from its Shorland armoured car into the flats. The RUC claimed that it was coming under sniper attack from the tower at the time. Patrick Rooney's death took place during a day of street violence in the area. Chairman of the enquiry into the riots, Mr Justice Scarman, found the use of the Browning machine gun \\"wholly unjustifiable\\". On 12 May 1981, an Army sniper killed INLA member Emmanuel McClarnon from the top of Divis Tower, on the night that Francis Hughes died on hunger strike. Dismantling of the post Following the IRA's statement that it was ending its armed campaign, the Army decided to dismantle the observation post. Dubbed a 'spy' post by Sinn F√©in, removal of the observation post commenced on 2 August 2005. In 2009, the top two floors of the tower were reinstated as residential properties. As part of a ¬£1.1 million refurbishment programme by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive eight extra flats were provided. In popular culture Both Divis Tower and the former Divis Flats have featured in multiple works of popular culture. For example: In films In the film '71, new recruits to the British Army, who are deployed to keep peace in Belfast, are told to never enter Divis Flats. However, when a father and daughter find the protagonist lying unconscious in the street, injured by bomb shrapnel, they carry him to their home in Divis Flats and tend to his wounds. Only then do they realise he is a soldier, which presents problems for all three of them. In photography Divis Flats and Divis Tower feature in numerous iconic photographs of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In television Divis Tower was featured in the popular BBC Northern Ireland sitcom Give My Head Peace. The fictional characters of Da, Cal, Ma, and for a while Dympna and Emer, all nationalists/republicans, lived in \\"Flat 47A, Divis Tower\\". It was first seen in the pilot episode entitled \\"Two Ceasefires and a Wedding\\" (made in 1995), and a full series renamed \\"Give My Head Peace\\" commenced broadcasting in 1998. \\"Da\\" was a Sinn F√©in assembly man and a staunch republican, who based his family in Divis Tower since the 1970s. The flat was constantly raided by the RUC (later the Police Service of Northern Ireland; PSNI). It was in the flat that the Protestant character \\"Billy\\", a RUC/PSNI policeman, met Da's daughter Emer, fell in love, and married her.

Basketball is the most popular sport in the Philippines, played on both the amateur and professional levels. History The national team playing against China at the 1917 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo. Basketball was introduced in the Philippines during the American colonial period with the first American teachers teaching the sport along with baseball through the YMCA and the school system. Basketball was first introduced to the Philippine public school system by the Americans as a women's sport in 1910 and was played in Interscholastic meets in 1911 until 1913. Women's basketball met opposition from conservative groups, particularly the Catholic Church who view bloomers worn by women basketball players as inappropriate. By the time skirts were allowed to be worn above bloomers as a compromise, women's basketball was already in decline and was only played in provincial and local interscholastic meets. Indoor softball and as well as volleyball became the more preferred sport for Filipino women. The first men's national team ‚Äì organized in the 1910s ‚Äì won the first Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913. In all but one of the ten editions of the games, the national team won the gold medal. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which had basketball as its main sport, was established in 1924. The Philippines became a member of FIBA through the Basketball Association of the Philippines in 1936. The Philippines made their debut in the Olympic Games in 1936 where they finished fifth, the best result of an Asian team in Olympic basketball history. In the same year, the first basketball stamp in the world was released by the country. The first commercial league was the basketball tournament of the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) which was established in 1938. The Philippines became an independent country in 1946, and in the 1950s, the national team did well in international tournaments. The Philippine team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951, the first-time basketball was played. The Philippine basketball team dominated the Asian Games until 1962. In the 1954 FIBA World Championship the Philippines placed third, winning the bronze medal, the best performance by an Asian team in the World Championship. After missing the first FIBA Basketball World Cup (known through 2010 as the FIBA World Championship) that was held in 1950 in Argentina, the Philippines participated in the 1954 FIBA World Championship held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Philippines finished with a 5‚Äì2 win-loss record in the Final Round games, and captured the bronze medal. The third place-finish is still currently the best finish by an Asian country in the World Cup. Carlos Loyzaga finished as the world tournament's third leading scorer (148 points/16.4 points per game) and was named in the FIBA World Mythical Five Selection. In the 1960s, the first FIBA Asia Championship was won by the Philippines with Carlos Badion as the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Meanwhile, the Philippines won the right to host the third FIBA World Championship, but were suspended after then-President Diosdado Macapagal, father of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, refused to issue visas to players from communist countries (notably basketball powerhouse Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union). The Philippines' dominance in sport waned after Carlos Loyzaga's retirement, and had performed poorly in the Olympic games where the national team was unable to break into top-10 positions. However, the country continued to play competitively in the Asian and World Championships. The commercial league model pioneered by the MICAA continued with the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) in 1975 and the Philippine Amateur Basketball League (PABL) in 1983. The PBA is the first professional basketball league in Asia and the second oldest in the world after the NBA.Bartholomew, Rafe. \\"Pacific Rims\\". New American Library, 2010, p. 13. The league's regulations are a hybrid of rules from FIBA and the NBA. The league was inaugurated on April 9, 1975.Bartholomew 2010, p. 13. The PABL was established to fill the void created after the collapse of the MICAA in 1981. In 1978, the Philippines hosted the FIBA World Championship, marking the first time that the international tournament was held in Asia. The Philippines was suspended by FIBA in 2005 due to a leadership crisis which affected the former national basketball association of the country ‚Äì the Basketball Association of the Philippines. In 2007, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas became the newly- recognized national basketball body for the Philippines by FIBA.

All three medalists jumped 2.17, but Major won on countback. In the summer that year he finished fourth at the 1971 European Championships. He then defended the gold medal at the 1972 European Indoor Championships in Grenoble. His winning result of 2.24 metres was a new championships record, and also his career best jump. In the same year he competed at the Olympic Games, tying for sixth place overall. At the 1973 European Indoor Championships he won his third gold medal in a row, this time with 2.20 metres.

During a police investigation, all possible suspects are usually asked to provide details of their whereabouts during the relevant time period, which where possible would usually be confirmed by other persons or in other ways (such as by checking phone records, or credit card receipts, use of CCTV, etc.). During a criminal trial, an alibi is a defence raised by the accused as proof that they could not have committed the crime because they were in some other place at the time the alleged offence was committed. The Criminal Law Deskbook of Criminal Procedure1988; states: \\"Alibi is different from all of the other defences; it is based upon the premise that the defendant is truly innocent.\\" Duty to disclose In some legal jurisdictions there may be a requirement that the accused disclose an alibi defence prior to the trial. This is to enable the investigators to verify whether or not such a claim is true. This is an exception to the rule that a criminal defendant cannot normally be compelled to furnish information to the prosecution. Since the alibi involves evidence of innocence rather than guilt, the privilege against self-incrimination is not implicated. In Canada, the defence must disclose an alibi defence with sufficient time for the authorities to investigate the alibi, and with sufficient particularization to allow for a meaningful investigation. Failure to comply with the two requirements will result in the court making an adverse inference against the alibi defence (but will not result in the exclusion of the alibi defence).R. v.

Florida, USSC, Dissenting opinion False alibi The giving of a false alibi, beside resulting in possible subsequent criminal offences (obstruction of justice, perjury, etc.), may, in some jurisdictions, result in negative ramifications for the trial itself. In Canada, the giving of a false alibi may be used by the court as actual evidence of guilt, provided certain requirements are met.R. v. Hibbert, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445R. v. O'Connor , (2002) 170 C.C.C.

It peaked on Boxing Day, 26 December, which is celebrated as St. Stephen's Day in Ireland. Storm The storm lasted from 3:00 on 24 December to 15:00 on 29 December 1998, peaking on 26 December. The Met Office reported that mean speeds over land reached nearly over a period of twelve hours, with gusts exceeding and being recorded at over were recorded at some locations. The storm followed a period of higher than average rainfall, with 400 mm to 800 mm falling in the west of the country and 200 mm to 300 mm in the east, in the four-month period from September to December. This softened the soil, making trees more vulnerable to wind. The Met Office estimated that a storm on the magnitude of the one in December 1998 occurs around once every four years somewhere in Britain, and once every twenty at any given point, with the wind coming in a belt around wide. Damage Large parts of northern England and Scotland lost access to electricity. 50,000 households were without electricity for more than 24 hours, with some supplies not restored until the New Year. Six electricity companies in Great Britain declared a systems emergency as a result of the damage. The reactors at Hunterston B nuclear power station were shut down when power was lost, possibly due to arcing at pylons caused by salt spray from the sea. When the grid connection was restored, the generators that had powered the station during the blackout were shut down and left on \\"manual start\\", so when the power failed again the station was powered by batteries for a short time of around 30 minutes, until the diesel generators were started manually. During this period the reactors were left without forced cooling, in a similar fashion to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, but the event at Hunterston was rated as INES 2.

The Spui was originally a body of water that formed the southern limit of the city until the 1420s, when the Singel canal was dug as an outer moat around the city. In 1882 the Spui was filled in and became the square that we know today. In 1996 the square was renovated and is now largely car-free. Tram lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 16, 24 and 25 stop at or near the Spui. The Spui is a popular destination for book- lovers, with a weekly book market on Fridays and a variety of bookstores on or near the square, including two shops dedicated to English-language literature (the American Book Center relocated to the Spui in October 2006). There is also a weekly art market on the Spui, every Sunday. The Spui provides entry to the Begijnhof, a Medieval courtyard.  Works of art  A small statue, Het Lieverdje (\\"The Little Darling\\"), stands on the square. The statue represents the youth of Amsterdam, always playing pranks yet with a heart of gold. He was a gift to the city from a cigarette company in 1960. In the 1960s, the Provo counterculture movement held weekly gatherings around the statue.

Function  This gene encodes a protein associated with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. A subset of patients with stiff person syndrome who were also affected by breast cancer are positive for autoantibodies against this protein. Alternate splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms. Additional splice variants have been described, but their full length sequences have not been determined. Amphiphysin is a brain-enriched protein with an N-terminal lipid interaction, dimerisation and membrane bending BAR domain, a middle clathrin and adaptor binding domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. In the brain, its primary function is thought to be the recruitment of dynamin to sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. There are 2 mammalian amphiphysins with similar overall structure. A ubiquitous splice form of amphiphysin-2 (BIN1) that does not contain clathrin or adaptor interactions is highly expressed in muscle tissue and is involved in the formation and stabilization of the T-tubule network. In other tissues amphiphysin is likely involved in other membrane bending and curvature stabilization events.

He was professor of physics at √âcole Polytechnique from 1852 to 1881 and received the Rumford Medal in 1858 for his work on light. He improved Brewster's inclined interference plates with the development of the Jamin interferometer.  Biography  Jules Jamin, son of Anthony Peter Jamin, was born in 1818 in Termes, France. He began his education at a small school in Vouziers, a small village located in northeast France. After some time there, he was sent to the College at Reims by his father, Antoine-Pierre. In his first year at the College at Reims Jules won nine awards. In 1838 he won the science competition award with honors, and in October of the same year he was accepted on first selection to enter √âcole normale sup√©rieure where he obtained a degree in physical sciences, mathematics and natural sciences. In 1841, he graduated first in the competition of comprehensive physical sciences. He obtained his first position at the college of Caen, where he succeeded Paul Desains. After two years, he joined the College Bourbon (today's Lyc√©e Condorcet) as a substitute teacher, then in 1844, he joined the College Louis-le-Grand as a teacher. While in Caen, he begun research in support of his thesis on the reflection of light on the surface of metals, for which in 1847 he received a doctorate in Physics with his thesis on light reflection on metallic surfaces. From 1844‚Äì1854, Jamin studied and confirmed the conclusions of Macedonio Melloni concerning energy absorption alongside fellow physicists L. Court√©p√©e and Antoine-Philibert Masson. In 1852 he was appointed professor of physics at the √âcole Polytechnique, a position he held until March 1881, when Alfred Potier succeeded him. In 1856 Jules Jamin began working on, and completed his well known instrument, the Jamin interferometer. In 1858 he was awarded the Rumford Medal, from the Royal Society, for his work on light and in 1863 he became a professor at the Faculty of Paris, succeeding C√©sar Despretz as the associate chair of experimental physics. Based on his lectures at the √âcole Polytechnique, he published a compelling paper titled \\"General essay on Physics\\". On July 17, 1871, he presented Z√©nobe Gramme's invention of the electrical engine to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1868, he joined the French Academy of Sciences and in the same year he created and headed the Physical Research Laboratory funded by the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes of which he was also the principal of the studies division. In 1886, he handed off the title of Director of the Physical Research Laboratory to Gabriel Lippmann. Through the Academy of Sciences, Jamin was a member of one of many committees whose purpose was to organize the Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments, a massive exhibition of scientific artifacts from which the Museum of Science in London was eventually founded. In 1882, with arrival of a new generation of physicists who came to do research for their doctorates, such as Gabriel Lippmann, Henri Pellat and Anatole Leduc, he replaced Henri Milne Edwards as Dean of the Faculty with Edmond Bouty becoming the deputy director of the laboratory. In the same year, he presided over the Academy of Sciences and became permanent secretary in 1884 succeeding Jean- Baptiste Dumas. Like many French scientists of the period, Jamin was known to perform scientific demonstrations in public with the goal of drawing enthusiastic crowds and gaining support for his work. Jamin was a staunch advocate of the movement in 19th century French towards precision measurement being essential for meaningful scientific experimentation. Jamin interferometer His work encompassed the subjects of magnetism, electricity, humidity, and capillary action (Jamin effect, Jamin chain). Other areas included the compressibility of liquids, the critical point of gases,specific heats, hygrometry, and the measurement of indices of refraction of gases, liquid water at different pressures, and of water vapor. In addition to the elliptical polarization of glassy substances, he discovered the negative elliptical polarization of fluorine. While he was a professor in Caen he would take his pupils on botanical and geologically focused expeditions on Sundays.Morgan, Appleton. ‚ÄúSketch of Jules Jamin.‚Äù The Popular Science Monthly, June 1887, pp. 262‚Äì266. In 1860 Jamin observed that when a cylindrical capillary tube was filled with a series (\\"chain\\") of alternating bubbles and water droplets, the chain remained immobile despite an increase or decrease of pressure at one end of the tube. See p. 173 of: * The \\"Jamin effect\\" has been more broadly defined as a resistance to flow in capillaries due to hysteresis of the contact angle, or to changes in the radius of the capillary, or to differences in the interfacial tension at the forward and trailing edges of bubbles.  ; see p. 1324\\\\. In his work with optics, he discovered the elliptical polarization of light reflected from glassy substances in the vicinity of the angle of polarization, as predicted by Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Jules Jamin observed the Solar eclipse of July 8, 1842 with mentoring from Fran√ßois Arago. This was also observed with Paul Laugier, F√©lix Mauvais, Jean Goujon, Herv√© Faye, and Charles Mathieu. In 1873, Jamin invented a magnet with a layered design that allowed it to carry twenty-two times its own weight. At the time the greatest lifting capacity demonstrated for an artificial magnet was only four to five times its own weight. He also improved on the Yablachkov Candle with his Jamin Electric Light, which he claimed \\"lights and relights itself as often as is required; only requires one circuit for all the neighboring candles; it replaces automatically those which are consumed, by new carbons; it employs no insulating material which might alter the color of the flame; and it requires no preliminary preparation of the carbons, which considerably diminishes the expense.\\" He married at Reims in 1851, Theresa Josephine Eudoxia Lebrun (1832-1880), with whom he had a daughter, Lucie who was the wife of the physicist Henri Becquerel, and a son, a painter, Paul Jamin. Jamin was friends with Irish physicist John Tyndall, and after the Franco-Prussian War began he even accepted Tyndall's offer to take care of his wife and children in Brittany while Jamin remained in Paris.  Works  Jules Jamin had a couple articles that were published in Revue des Deux Mondes, a French magazine that was published in Paris. One article that Jamin had published was titled \\"La Physique Depuis Les Recherches D‚ÄôHerschel: I. Melloni et ses Travaux sur la Chaleur Rayonnantewhich\\", which translates to \\"Physics Since Herschel's Research: Melloni and His Work on Radiant Heat.\\" This article was published on December 15 of 1854. The other article that Jamin wrote was titled \\"L'Optique et la Peinture,\\" which translates as \\"Optics and Painting.\\" This article was published on February 1 of 1857. Both of these articles were published during Jamin's time as the professor of physics at the √âcole Polytechnique. *La ros√©e, son histoire, son r√¥le (Dew, its history and its role), published in soft cover edition by VillaRrose Publishing 2004, ‚Äî an article of Jamin in Revue des Deux Mondes, January 15, 1879. * Cours de physique de l'√âcole P√≥lytechnique (Physics lessons from L'Ecole Polytechnique) publish by Gauthier-Villars, 1886.Nature: Volume 33, no.836.

His name is located on the side that faces Grenelle, a neighborhood located in the southwestern part of Paris. Jamin's areas of interest were not confined entirely to the sciences. He enjoyed studying the work of distinguished artists at the Louvre and was a talented artist himself. His family is in possession of many of his paintings, as is the church in his native commune of Termes.

He won the Inter Dominion Pacing Championship in both 1973 and 1974, becoming the first horse to successfully defend an Inter Dominion title. Hondo Grattan was the first horse in Australia to win (AUD)$200,000 and also the first horse to win 21 races at Harold Park Paceway.Agnew, Max, Silks & Sulkies ‚Äì The Complete Book of Australian and New Zealand Harness Racing, Doubleday, Sydney, 1986, He was a winner at a time of top competition, that included horses such as Pure Steel and Paleface Adios. He was inducted into the Inter Dominion Hall of Fame. Racing record Throughout his career Hondo Grattan was trained by A.D. \\"Tony\\" Turnbull at The Lagoon, Bathurst, NSW who part-owned him with farmers Bill and Bob Webb. Hondo Grattan made a winning racetrack debut on 24 May 1971 at Penrith however it was his only win in six starts as a two-year-old. He began his three-year-old season by winning eight consecutive races before being defeated by Jason King at Harold Park on 26 November 1972. He then won a further eight consecutive races including the New South Wales Sires‚Äô Produce, second in importance only to the New South Wales Derby. After defeating Adios Victor and Jason King in a derby heat in March, he was unplaced in the final to Bold Biami and fourth to Bold Biami in the Simpson Sprint. He won 17 of his 21 starts during the season. Hondo Grattan finished fourth in the Australasian Four-year-old Championship at Harold Park and after an unsuccessful trip to Melbourne he contested the Australia Day Cup series in January 1973. After a win and an unlucky fifth in his heats he finished third in the final on 26 January to Bold Biami. Hondo Grattan also won the 1973 New South Wales Futurity. The Inter Dominion was to be held in Sydney that year and it attracted an extremely strong field of contenders including defending champion Welcome Advice, New Zealand stars Robalan, Arapaho, Manaroa, Royal Ascot and Globe Bay, Victorian Reichman the runner-up in the 1972 Miracle Mile Pace, as well as New South Wales trained Just Too Good, Jason King and Australia Day Cup winner Bold Biami. The quantity and quality of horses contesting the series was such that six heats were held on each night, the only time this has happened. On the first night he beat Arapaho and Jason King before defeating Speedy Ben and Bold Biami to be the only pacer undefeated after two rounds of heats. The third round was postponed several days due to rain, but when they were held Hondo Grattan remained unbeaten. After drawing barrier two Hondo Grattan was favourite for the final in a strong field. Despite a tough run Hondo Grattan prevailed over Royal Ascot and Glamour Chief. After trainer- driver Turnbull was suspended he missed the Miracle Mile Pace. Hondo Grattan then won the Lord Mayors‚Äô Cup following second and first place heat finishes. He did it the hard way defeating Nicotine Prince after making a slow start. Early in the 1973/4 season Hondo Grattan contested the Spring Cup at Harold Park and finished second in both his heats off a 20-metre handicap before finishing third to Bold Jason in the final off the same mark. He then broke 2:00 for the first time with a 1:59.5 time trial at Bathurst. Heading to Melbourne for the Hunter Cup carnival, he was third to Monara and a winner defeating Amlin and Reichman before finishing fifth in the A G Hunter Cup. Hondo Grattan‚Äôs next mission was to defend his Interdominion crown in Perth, Western Australia. He made a winning start by defeating New Zealander Hi Foyle on the first night but he was only eight on the second night of the carnival. In both those races he came from a 15m handicap. The third round of heats were run under free-for-all conditions but the ‚ÄòBathurst Bulldog‚Äô could finish no better than a dead-heat for fourth and was fortunate to make the final field. The 1974 Interdominion is best remembered for a crash at the beginning of the race that left only four winning chances. With many of his main rivals out of play Hondo Grattan held off the finishing challenge of Adios Victor with Bret Armagh third. Bret Armagh was later disqualified with Royal Gaze promoted to third. By winning the race he became the first horse to win consecutive Interdominions, and only the second horse to win the race twice. Coincidentally, Captain Sandy, the other two-time winner, also recorded his second win in Perth. Returning to Sydney, Hondo Grattan won the Miracle Mile Pace in a career best 1:59 over Paleface Adios and Mitchell Victory becoming the first horse to win both the Miracle Mile Pace and Interdominion in the same year. His last major assignment was the Albion Park Ten Thousand in Brisbane where he was fifth in the final. He was the leading stakeswinner in Australian harness racing for the second consecutive season. Hondo Grattan‚Äôs first major engagement of the 1974/5 season was the Hunter Cup carnival in Melbourne where he was third to Gallagher before finishing third to Royal Gaze and Paleface Adios in the Cup itself. The Interdominion was held in Auckland, New Zealand that year and although a strong team of Australian pacers including Hondo Grattan, Paleface Adios, Just Too Good and Royal Gaze made the trip across the Tasman, they were no match for Young Quinn who was unbeaten during the series. Hondo Grattan performed creditably finishing fifth, third and second in his heats despite a 25m handicap. Turnbull was suspended for the final when ‚ÄòHondo‚Äô finished sixth to Young Quinn. It looked like a major race win would escape him that season, but he completed 1974/5 by winning the Lord Mayor‚Äôs Cup from a handicap of 25m. During the season he became Australian harness racing‚Äôs leading stakesearner. The 1975/6 season was Hondo Grattan's last on the racetrack. His best performances during the season were a third to Paleface Adios and Don't Retreat in the Miracle Mile Pace and win over King Frost in the Hurricane Sprint. Retirement Hondo Grattan was retired to stud after finishing third to King Frost on 17 April 1976. He was not a great success at stud but one of his best progeny was the consistent Mister Meggs who later raced in the USA. Hondo Grattan died following a bout of colic at the age of 26 on 30 November 1994 in his yard at The Lagoon having remained at stud with Tony Turnbull after his retirement. Honours He was twice voted NSW Harness Horse of the Year in 1973 and 1974, and had a song written about him called \\"Little Hondo\\", which was sung by racecaller Johnny Tapp. See also *Harness racing in Australia References Category:Standardbred racehorses bred in Australia Category:Inter Dominion winners Category:Miracle Mile winners Category:1968 racehorse births Category:1994 racehorse deaths ","title":"Hondo Grattan"},{"id":"7075504","text":"Scott Warren Anderson (born 26 June 1968) is a former field hockey goalkeeper from New Zealand, who finished in eighth position with the Men's National Team, nicknamed Black Sticks, at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

It serves the council areas of Bath and North East Somerset, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, Bristol, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Gloucestershire, North Somerset, Plymouth, Isles of Scilly, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Swindon, Torbay and Wiltshire. On 1 March 2011, SWASFT was the first ambulance service in the country to become a NHS foundation trust. On 1 February 2013, neighbouring Great Western Ambulance Service merged with the trust. SWASFT serves a population of more than 5.47 million, and its area is estimated to receive an influx of over 17.5 million visitors each year. The operational area is predominantly rural but also has large urban centres including Bristol, Plymouth, Exeter, Truro, Bath, Swindon, Gloucester, Bournemouth and Poole. The service is headquartered in Exeter, Devon. It has 96 ambulance stations and six charity-operated air ambulance bases within its area. The Chief Executive is Will Warrender, who was appointed to the trust during July 2020 after retirement of former Chief Executive Ken Wenman. The trust's core operations include: * Emergency ambulance 999 services * Urgent Care Services (UCS) ‚Äì GP out-of-hours medical care (Dorset) * Tiverton Urgent Care Centre. The Star of Life ambulance boat serves the Scilly Isles It is one of the ambulance trusts providing England with emergency medical services, and employs around 4,500 mainly clinical and operational staff (including Paramedics, Emergency Care Practitioners, Advanced Technicians, Emergency Care Assistants, Ambulance Care Assistants and Nurse Practitioners). In addition there are around 3,200 volunteers including community first responders, BASICS doctors, fire co- responders and patient transport drivers. Facts and figures The trust covers an area of . There are 95 ambulance stations, six air ambulance bases delivered by five charities, two control rooms, two Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) bases and one boat across the SWASFT operational area. In 2017/2018, approximately one in nine 999 calls to SWASFT were treated over the telephone. \\"Hear and treat\\", where the patient receives clinical advice over the telephone, accounted for 11.6% of calls. For 35.8% of incidents the patients experienced \\"see and treat\\", when the patient receives treatment or advice at the scene of the incident. In a further 5.9% of incidents, the patient was taken to a non-emergency hospital department such as a community hospital or minor injuries unit. The remaining incidents resulted in a patient being taken to a hospital emergency department, thus around half of the incidents (53%) resulted in a patient not being conveyed. In 2017, SWASFT was the best performing ambulance service in the country for non-conveyance rates. In addition approximately 62% of patients taken to hospital were admitted ‚Äì this is again the highest (best) performance for an ambulance trust in the country. This means that when SWASFT takes a patient to an emergency department they are likely to be admitted, not simply treated and discharged, confirming that this is the right place for them to receive the care they need. The number of compliments received by the trust in 2014/2015 increased by 41% to 2,055 while complaints also rose by 20% to 1,268. The inspection of the trust by the Care Quality Commission in 2016 identified several areas which required improvement. The trust's income for 2017/18 was ¬£240million. In 2018, the trust said it would need an extra ¬£12M a year to meet the new ambulance performance standards.  Structure  SWASFT has two clinical hubs which take emergency calls and dispatch resources: one within the Exeter headquarters and the other at Filton, north of Bristol. , the centres had a combined staff of around 450. After a reorganisation in 2018, the trust's operations and ambulance stations are divided into eight areas. Bristol, North Somerset & South Gloucestershire area Cornwall & Isles of Scilly area North & East Devon area South & West Devon area Dorset area Gloucestershire area Somerset area Wiltshire area Air ambulances From its control centre, SWASFT is able to deploy a number of charity-funded air ambulance services that operate within its area: Vehicle fleet SWAST ambulance on an emergency call The SWASFT vehicle fleet includes *emergency ambulances *patient transport ambulances *rapid response vehicles *rapid response motorcycles *bicycles *hazardous area response teams (based in Exeter and Bristol) *ALN 043 Star of Life Wave Saver 1000 Class ambulance boat  Tiverton Urgent Care Centre  In May 2014, the trust won a contract to run a doctor-led minor injuries unit at Tiverton and District Hospital, Devon. Patients do not need an appointment to visit the centre, which is open seven days a week and provides treatment for minor injuries and ailments.  Former services  SWASFT ran the NHS 111 non- emergency phone service for Dorset, from a call centre at St Leonards. In 2016, the Care Quality Commission told SWASFT to make significant improvements in the service. In July 2019, the trust announced that it was handing back the contract for the service, owing to staff shortages, and on 1 May 2020, the 111 service transferred to Dorset HealthCare.

Mascall in most of his writings.Hebblethwaite, Brian ‚ÄòMascall, Eric Lionel (1905‚Äì1993)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Mascall was for many years one of the major figures in British theology and well respected on the Continent and in North America. He authored more than 20 books, in which he expounded Anglican theology in its most Catholic of forms. Mascall was arguably the most influential in a group of like-minded theologians, most of whom had predeceased him ‚Äì Austin Farrer, Gregory Dix, Lionel Thornton and Gabriel Hebert.Obituary: Canon E. L. Mascall Life Born in London on 12 December 1905, Eric Mascall was the son of John Mascall and his wife Susan. He was educated at Latymer Upper School, Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1931 he entered Ely Theological College and was ordained in the Church of England in 1933. After a period as a schoolmaster at Bablake School, Coventry,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary- canon-e-l-mascall-1473551.html Mascall was ordained priest in 1933 at Southwark Cathedral, serving his first curacy at St Andrew's Stockwell. In 1935 he crossed the river to St Matthew's Westminster in the Diocese of London. Subsequently, he taught theology at Lincoln Theological College and Christ Church, Oxford. He joined the Oratory of the Good Shepherd in 1938. In 1962 he became Professor of Historical Theology at King's College London and followed this appointment by a period as canon theologian of Truro Cathedral.

Intellectual interests Mascall was a devout Anglo-Catholic but his early studies were in mathematics. He took a first in the subject at Pembroke College, and the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge. He remained engaged in relations between the Anglican Communion, Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Churches. Mascall wrote on many theological themes as well as natural theology; these included the above-mentioned ecumenism in The Recovery of Unity (1958), science and religion in his Bampton Lectures, Christian Theology and Natural Science (1956), regarded by many at the time of its publication as the best book on the subject in English.Obituary: Canon E.

It was located at 56 West Regent Street in the city centre and established a reputation as the launch pad for many Scottish musicians. Burns Howff resident bands included Power, that later changed name to Stone the Crows. This band featured Maggie Bell on vocals, and James Dewar on bass guitar. James Dewar, known as Jimmy Dewar later formed The Robin Trower Band with ex Procol Harum guitarist Robin Trower and drummer Reg Isadore. It was in Burns Howff that Alex Harvey met with the musicians who were to become the Sensational Alex Harvey Band. Other bands who played at Burns Howff included Beggars Opera, Chou Pahrot, and the illustrious 'Foxy', a talented 3-piece featuring Brian Denniston (guitar), Jimmy Johnston (Bass) and Nod Kerr (Drums). The Shard a 5 piece R&B; and soul band played frequently at the Howff for about 3 years in the late 60's. Jimmy McLachlan lead guitar, Tommy Graham bass, Bill Samson on Drums, Joe McCann Keyboards and Jim Robertson vocals were the longest serving members of the band. Shortly before the ‚ÄòHOWFF‚Äô closed a recording studio was installed called STUDIO In the upstairs lounge. This was a rather modest affair that was housed in what was essentially a walk in cupboard. The studio was popular with local bands, and clients included Johnny and the Self Abusers who were playing regularly at another Glasgow music pub called The Mars Bar, that featured mainly Punk acts. Johnny and the Self Abusers split up and its members went on to form The Cuban Heels and Simple Minds. With the bands playing in the upstairs lounge there was a resident DJ in the bar area from 1973 onwards. This was called The Pony Express where rock music was played to the bar customers and also transmitted into the upstairs lounge while the band had their break. _DJ Gordon Elrick_ also ran theme nights including the popular Tuesday Club where regulars dressed up and mimed to old standards. This made the Howff one of the busiest pubs in the area on a usually quiet Tuesday night. Burns Howff finally closed in 1984. JOHN Waterson was one of the great characters of the Scottish trade. Well-known and highly respected, he had a successful career spanning more than 70 years. Not only did he own some of Glasgow's most famous pubs, but successful hotels, nightclubs and off-sales too. A former president of both the Strathclyde and Scottish Licensed Trade Associations, John was also very active in trade politics. He was a past director of The Scottish Licensed Trade Benevolent Society, a member of The Incorporation of Maltmen in Glasgow, a past chair of Strathclyde Youth and formerly a member of the Children's Panel in Glasgow. John Waterson was born in Great Hamilton Street in the Calton district of Glasgow in 1925. Not too much is known of his early years, although growing up in the Calton in the mid 1920s and ‚Äò30s must have been interesting to say the least. He went to St Alphonse Primary School, but to suggest he had a good attendance record would be stretching the truth ‚Äì he always said he was far too busy for lessons. In 1938, aged 13, he popped into The Central Hotel in Glasgow on a whim to ask if there were any jobs. He was told that if the bellboy uniform fitted he could start the next day. It did, and so started a career that would last a lifetime. His next step was as a waiter, and he learned his trade in various Glasgow hotels and restaurants. After the war he joined MacLauchlan‚Äôs the brewer, which employed him as a waiter in the famous Whitehall Restaurant on Renfield Street. Later he took charge of the cocktail bar and became an active member of The United Kingdom Bartenders‚Äô Guild. In 1957 MacLauchlan's leased him The Moss-Side Inn in Paisley. This was very successful and in 1962 he bought his first pub ‚Äì the run down Burns Bar in Govan. On the face of it, it was perhaps not a great career move at the time ‚Äì a Catholic buying a run-down Rangers pub in Govan, frequented by hardened dockers. On his first day the regulars came in only to tell him they had all barred themselves. By closing time he had sold two pints of heavy ‚Äì one to a Catholic docker who wanted to meet the bravest publican in Glasgow, the other to the Jewish shopkeeper next door who wanted to meet the most stupid. However, slowly but surely he worked his magic. Regular customers came back, the Rangers bus ran from the pub again, and within a year he had revamped the d√©cor, filled it with Burns memorabilia and changed its name to Burns Cottage. It became one of only two pubs in Glasgow licensed for live music, and musicians flocked there in their droves. John was one of the first to turn Scottish pubs into more than places to drink. He was involved in the Scottish music scene and between the ‚Äò60s and early ‚Äò80s gave a platform to many aspiring musicians. He installed closed circuit television so patrons in the bar could watch the live bands in the lounge, which was revolutionary at the time. STV even broadcast a live talent show from the lounge on a Saturday night ‚Äì a 1960s Scottish X-Factor from surely Britain's first themed pub. He was always ahead of the game. He opened his most famous pub, The Burns Howff in Glasgow, in 1967. Both the Cottage and The Howff played host to most of Scotland's best musicians, including Maggie Bell, Frankie Miller, James Dewar, Alex Harvey, Simple Minds, Midge Ure, and The Average White Band. All played for John, although his relationship with musicians could be fraught. When one was interviewed he said he would never forget John for giving him his big break, but bemoaned the fact that he and his band were only paid ¬£20 a night. John retorted that this was slander ‚Äì he never paid any band more than ¬£15! Over the years till the mid-‚Äô90s, surely the golden age for the pub business, he also opened The Burns Howff in Renfrew and The Wee Howff in Paisley. Other acquisitions were McCalls Bar in Hope Street, which became The Pot Still. Much to his enjoyment he also bought The Whitehall, which became The Maltman, in 1982. The 39 Steps followed in 1986. That was the last pub John Waterson owned. He moved into hotels, first at the Gleniffer in Paisley then The Stuart and Bruce Hotels in East Kilbride and lastly The Golden Lion hotel in Stirling, which the family still owns. Underpinning everything he was a licensed trade man, a publican through and through. Professional, disciplined and totally dedicated, he expected the same from everyone else. He instinctively knew what his customers wanted and always saw change coming ‚Äì who else would have taken the chance and opened a no smoking bar, the successful Maltman, in 1982? He said he would never retire and never did, in fact he was still doing deals well into his 80s. John is survived by his wife of 65 years Josephine, children Paul, Josephine, Jonathan and Mark, 11 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. His eldest daughter Kathleen was tragically killed in a car accident in the US in 1979. He was always thankful that the bellboy's uniform at The Central Hotel fitted him on that fateful day in 1938 ‚Äì so was the licensed trade of Scotland and its customers.

Konevsky Monastery ( (as it is written on the seal of the monastery), ) is a Russian Orthodox monastery that occupies the Konevets Island in the western part of the Lake Ladoga, Leningrad Oblast, Russian Federation. It is often regarded as the twin monastery with the Valaam Monastery, also located on an island group in the same lake.  Medieval origins  Konevets Island ( or Kononsaari) has the maximum length of 5 km; its average width is 2 km. The island is separated from the mainland by a 5-km-wide strait. In the Middle Ages, the island was considered holy by the Finnish tribes who particularly revered a huge boulder in the shape of a horse's skull, weighing more than 750 tons. This boulder is known as Kon‚Äô-Kamen‚Äô or Hevoskivi (literally, \\"Steed-Stone\\") and gives its name to the island. The monastery was founded around 1393 by St. Arseny Konevsky, who wished to convert pagan Karelians to Christianity. The location of the monastery was changed several times, in order to avert floods. The church of the Nativity of the Theotokos was founded by St. Arseny in 1428; it was at this church that the monastery's main shrine was placed. It was a miraculous image of Mother of God, brought by St. Arseny from Mount Athos and representing Christ playing with a dove nestling, symbolizing spiritual purity. Like the Valaam Monastery, the abbey at Konevets was known for its missionary activities. The Swedes captured the island during the Ingrian War, forcing the monks to retreat to Novgorod. Only after Russia retook the territory in the course of the Great Northern War they were allowed to reclaim their ancient possessions in Konevets. The revived cloister depended upon Novgorod until 1760, when it was officially recognized as a separate monastic establishment. The domes as seen from the lake In 1812, after the Finnish War the monastery administratively became part of the newly formed Grand Duchy of Finland, along with the rest of \\"Old Finland\\".  19th century  The golden age of the monastery came with the 19th century, when its fame spread to the imperial capital and the island was visited by eminent visitors from Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Dumas and Fyodor Tyutchev. An 1873 essay by Nikolai Leskov describes his impressions from the monastery. As a consequence of its high profile, the monastic community could fund extensive building projects, starting with the construction of a new cathedral in 1800‚Äì09. This huge two-storey eight-pillared building was designed by a local starets. It is surmounted by five octagonal drums bearing five blue bud-shaped domes. The same style is applied to the three-storey belltower (1810‚Äì12), rising to the height of 35 meters. Several other churches, a quay and an inn were added in the course of the century. Two sketae were set up to mark the ancient locations of the monastery.  20th century  The main church is dedicated to the Nativity of the Theotokos After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the monastery passed to the newly independent Finland, and came under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Finnish Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The island was fortified by the Finnish military, and the inn was expropriated to house a regiment staff. During the Winter War and Continuation War the monastery buildings were damaged. On 13 March 1940 the Winter War ended. The previous day the monks had been evacuated to the interior of Finland, taking the holy icon with them, but leaving the iconostasis, church bells, and the library. Another personal possession of St. Arseny, the Konevsky Psalter, dated to the 14th century, was sent to the Russian National Library. In 1940, the monks bought an estate named Hiekka (‚ÄòSands‚Äô) from the Saastamoinen company in Keitele, and the monastery continued to function there until 1956. The monks returned for a brief period during the Continuation War, but withdrew on 19 June 1944, ten days after the Soviet Union began the Offensive on the Karelian Isthmus, even though the Soviet troops never conquered the island or the adjacent shoreline on the isthmus. (These areas were ceded to the Soviet Union after the 1944 Moscow Armistice of September 19, 1944.) In 1956 the monks joined the New Valamo Monastery in Hein√§vesi. During the Soviet period, the monastery housed a military unit. In 1990 it became one of the first monasteries in the region to be revived by the Russian Orthodox Church. In November 1991, the brethren announced the discovery of St. Arseny's relics, that apparently had been hidden from the Swedes in 1573. By 2004, the Konevsky Monastery, which hosts a large number of tourists and pilgrims, had been mostly restored. References Literature * Bertash, Aleksander & Hieromonk Arseni: Konevitsan luostari.

He was reigning world champion between 1924 and 1928 after winning the gold medal in the 1924 Summer Olympics in the bantamweight category. His family was from Aberdeen, Scotland and Bedfordshire, England. Amateur career Willie Smith's boxing career began in a Johannesburg orphanage. The South African had George Harris to thank for much of his success. Harris, who had become the first SA flyweight champion when he stopped Marcus Henning in Kimberley on 12 November 1909, found time twice a week to give boxing lessons to orphans in the St George's Home in Johannesburg. Among his pupils was 12-year-old Willie Smith, said to be the terror of the neighbourhood and a boy who hardly needed an excuse to get behind his fists. Harris taught him as much as he could, but did not convince Smith that there was much more to boxing than battering your opponent into submission. In 1920, trainer Johnny Watson went to St George's to watch a tournament. He was impressed with Smith's tenacity and ended up in the boy's corner, giving him advice. This was to be the start of a lifelong partnership. Smith fought all over South Africa and won 32 amateur contests in a year. Watson taught him that defence and tactics were as important as a solid punch and turned the little slugger into a stylish boxer. In the trials for the 1924 Olympic Games, Smith came up against Harry Tyrell, who later became the father of Springbok soccer goalkeeper Aubrey. Smith won through to represent South Africa in Paris, together with Roy Ingram, Ernie Eustace and Dick Beland. Smith became the youngest Olympic boxing champion when he won the bantamweight division. Pro career He made his professional debut on 25 June 1925 against SA bantamweight champion Scotty Frazer and they fought to an eight-round draw. In a return fight on 26 September, he defeated Frazer on a disqualification in the 13th round. The bout was billed as being for the SA bantamweight title, but it was not recognised by the Transvaal Boxing Board of Control. Smith went on to win 11 bouts in a row before meeting Baldock. His victory thrilled his countrymen and there were long queues when a film of the fight went on circuit some weeks later. The youngster was then taken to the United States and beaten by Dominick Petrone. After a stay of five months, a despondent Smith decided to return and in 1928 he defeated Young Johnny Brown, Sammy Tucker and Mickey Doyle and drew with Pierre Pothier. Early in 1929 he went to Australia where he beat Archie Cowan in his first fight. Then he lost in two fights against the heavier Fidel LaBarba and was knocked out by a welterweight, Jack Roberts. On his return, Smith defeated Dolf du Plessis on points over 15 rounds. The bout, held on 30 November 1929, was billed as being for the SA featherweight title, but this was never authenticated. Smith had two cracks at the Empire bantamweight title, losing to Dick Corbett in 1930 and to Johnny McGrory in December 1936. He made a determined effort to recapture his old form and outpointed Ernest Wohrer, an Austrian, and then beat Frenchman Maurice Holtzer. Then the Union Sporting Club brought out Freddie Miller, the former world featherweight champion, to face Smith. Smith was knocked in the sixth round. Only seven weeks later, in a meaningless return match, he was knocked out again, this time in the seventh round. The curtain finally came down when he was beaten by McGrory. He finished with a record of 39‚Äì13‚Äì3 (2). Retirement Having retired from boxing, Smith spent several years as salesman and commercial traveller before running the Richmond Hotel in Hamburg, near Roodepoort, on the West Rand. He became one of the best-known South African referees after World War 2. He handled some big fights featuring Johnny Ralph and Vic Toweel, including Toweel's world title bouts against Luis Romero and Jimmy Carruthers. Smith died of a heart attack in 1955, at the age of 51.

Flows depicted in this manner appear like noodles, hence the coining of this term. This method of statistics was first used to track routing through factories. Visualizing flow in this manner can reduce inefficiency within the flow of a system. In regards to animal populations and weather buoys drifting through the ocean, they are drawn to study distribution and migration patterns. Within meteorology, these diagrams can help determine confidence in a specific weather forecast, as well as positions and intensities of high and low pressure systems. They are composed of deterministic forecasts from atmospheric models or their various ensemble members. Within medicine, they can illustrate the effects of drugs on patients during drug trials. Applications Biology Spaghetti diagrams have been used to study why butterflies are found where they are, and to see how topographic features (such as mountain ranges) limit their migration and range. Within mammal distributions across central North America, these plots have correlated their edges to regions which were glaciated within the previous ice age, as well as certain types of vegetation. Meteorology Spaghetti plot of ten NCEP global ensemble members at the 500 hPa pressure level for a 3.5 day forecast. Areas of greatest uncertainty are circled in red Within meteorology, spaghetti diagrams are normally drawn from ensemble forecasts. A meteorological variable e.g. pressure, temperature, or precipitation amount is drawn on a chart for a number of slightly different model runs from an ensemble. The model can then be stepped forward in time and the results compared and be used to gauge the amount of uncertainty in the forecast. If there is good agreement and the contours follow a recognizable pattern through the sequence, then the confidence in the forecast can be high. Conversely, if the pattern is chaotic, i.e., resembling a plate of spaghetti, then confidence will be low. Ensemble members will generally diverge over time and spaghetti plots are a quick way to see when this happens. Spaghetti plots can be a more favorable choice compared to the mean-spread ensemble in determining the intensity of a coming cyclone, anticyclone, or upper level ridge or trough. Because ensemble forecasts naturally diverge as the days progress, the projected locations of meteorological features will spread further apart. A mean-spread diagram will take a mean of the calculated pressure from each spot on the map as calculated by each permutation in the ensemble, thus effectively smoothing out the projected low and making it appear broader in size but weaker in intensity than the ensemble's permutations had actually indicated. It can also depict two features instead of one if the ensemble clustering is around two different solutions. Various forecast models within tropical cyclone track forecasting can be plotted on a spaghetti diagram to show confidence in five-day track forecasts. When track models diverge late in the forecast period, the plot takes on the shape of a squashed spider, and can be referred to as such in National Hurricane Center discussions. Within the field of climatology and paleotempestology, spaghetti plots have been used to correlate ground temperature information derived from boreholes across central and eastern Canada. As in other disciplines, spaghetti diagrams can be used to show the motion of objects, such as drifting weather buoys over time. Business Spaghetti chart which shows nurse movement through a facility in the search for a glucometer Spaghetti diagrams were first used to track routing through a factory. Spaghetti plots are a simple tool to visualize movement and transportation. Analyzing flows through systems can determine where time and energy is wasted, and identifies where streamlining would be beneficial. This is true not only with physical travel through a physical place, but also during more abstract processes such as the application of a mortgage loan. Medicine Spaghetti plots can be used to track the results of drug trials amongst a number of patients on one individual graph to determine their benefit. They have also been used to correlate progesterone levels to early pregnancy loss. The half-life of drugs within people's blood plasma, as well as discriminating effects between different populations, can be diagnosed quickly via these diagrams.

His great victory at the Battle of Tara against Olaf Cuaran in 980 resulted in Gaelic control of the Kingdom of Dublin. First reign as High King M√°el Sechnaill belonged to the Clann Cholm√°in branch of the U√≠ N√©ill dynasty. He was the grandson of Donnchad Donn, great-grandson of Flann Sinna and great-great-grandson of the first M√°el Sechnaill, M√°el Sechnaill mac M√°ele Ruanaid. The Kings of Tara or High Kings of Ireland had for centuries alternated between the various U√≠ N√©ill branches. By M√°el Sechnaill's time this alternating succession passed between Clann Cholm√°in in the south and the Cen√©l nE√≥gain in the north, so that he succeeded Domnall ua N√©ill in 980. This system had survived previous challenges by outsiders including the kings of Ulster, Munster and Leinster, and the Viking invasions. Defeat of Olaf Cuaran at the Battle of Tara In 980, Olav Cuar√°n, King of Dublin, summoned auxiliaries from Norse-ruled Scottish Isles and from Mann and attacked Meath, but was defeated by M√°el Sechnaill at Tara. Reginald, Olaf's heir, was killed. M√°el Sechnaill followed up his victory with a siege of Dublin which surrendered after three days and nights. When Ma√©l Sechnaill took Dublin in 980, according to Chronicon Scotorum, he freed all the slaves then residing in the city. Battle of Glenmama In 997, at a royal meeting near Clonfert, M√°el Sechnaill met with his long-time rival Brian Boru, King of Munster.√ì Corr√°in, p 123 The two kings made a truce, by which Brian was granted rule over the southern half of Ireland, while M√°el Sechnaill retained the northern half and high kingship. In honour of this arrangement, M√°el Sechnaill handed over to Brian the hostages he had taken from Dublin and Leinster; and in 998, Brian handed over to M√°el Sechnaill the hostages of Connacht. In the same year, Brian and M√°el Sechnaill began co-operating against the Norse of Dublin for the first time. Late in 999, however, the Leinstermen, historically hostile to domination by either the U√≠ N√©ill overkings or the King of Munster, allied themselves with the Norse of Dublin and revolted against Brian. The Annals of the Four Masters records that Brian and M√°el Sechnaill united their forces, and according to the Annals of Ulster, they met the Leinster-Dublin army at Glenmama on Thursday, 30 December, 999.

In fact this was a bloodless shift resulting from the failure of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, his kinsmen, to support M√°el Sechnaill against the aspirations of the extremely militarized overlord of Munster. Brian would have little more success with them himself. Because of the death of Brian Boru in 1014,BORU as well as the death of his son, grandson and many other Munster nobles at the Battle of Clontarf, M√°el Sechnaill succeeded in regaining the titular High Kingship,King Malachy More with the aid of his northern kinsman Flaithbertach Ua N√©ill, but the High Kingship, albeit with opposition, did not reappear until Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥ of Leinster rose to power. Clann Cholm√°in provided no further High Kings, but the northern U√≠ N√©ill of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain provided two: Domnall Ua Lochlainn and Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn.

It is situated 45 km from Solapur.The temple was built in c. 12th century CE. Bhavani (also known as Tulaja, Turaja, Tvarita, AmbƒÅ and JagadambƒÅ) is an avatar of the Hindu goddess Parvati . She is a form of Durga who is worshiped in Maharashtra, and also by Rajputs of North Gujarat, Northern Karnataka, Western Rajasthan and Punjab.[1] Bhavani translates to \\"giver of life\\", meaning the power of nature or the source of creative energy. She is considered to be a mother who provides to her devotees and also plays the role of dispensing justice by killing Asuras. Lord Shiva as Bhairava (Bhava or Bhavaneeswar), Goddess Parvati as Bhavani. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj , the founder of Maratha kingdom, always visited this temple to seek blessings. The legend has to its credit to say that the Goddess gave him a sword called ‚ÄòBhavani kadga‚Äô' by using which Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was successful in his expeditions. The history of the temple dates back to the days of ' Skanda Purana ' as it finds a mention in that holy script. According to the epic story there was a sage \\"Kardam\\" and his consort \\"Anubhuthi‚Äô with an infant, in this area. After his death his wife \\"Anubhuthi\\" performed a penance for goddess Parvati in the name of Bhavani on the banks of river \\"Mandakini\\" to look after her child. There was a demon (Rakshasa) by name ‚ÄúKukur\\" who tortured her. Then Goddess Bhavani rescued Anubhuthi and killed the demon. The goddess on the prayer of her pet devotee settled on the hill of \\"Bala ghat\\". Since then the Mother Goddess came to be called as Bhavani of Tuljapur or Tulja Bhavani. Mother Goddess Bhavani temple is the place where Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj graced was blessed by Matha Bhavani. It is situated at Tuljapur as such it is popularly known as Tulja Bhavani Temple in district of Maharashtra. It is one of the 51 Shakti Peetas attributed to Goddess Parvati. The second among the 'Shaktipeetas' is Goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur. Bhavani is one who gives life and source of original power. Tuljapur is at 45 km from Solhapur. Historically this temple was built in 12th century. There is yet another Tulja Bhavani temple built in 1537-1540 in Chittorgarh. There is a third temple of Tulja Bhavani in the village of Patnakuva Gandhinagar in Gujarat. According to the priest, this Goddess came here from Tuljapur during 14th century. The Goddess is said to be swayambhu (self emanated). It is true that God or Goddess is always referred as ‚Äòswayambhu‚Äô in Vedas, Puranas and many legends. But it does not refer to the stone idol installed in a temple. What is attributed is to the invisible Supreme power. The second among the 'Shaktipeeths' is Tulja Bhavani of Tuljapur. It is the family deity of the Bhosale Royal family, the Yadavs and of countless numbers of families belonging to different castes. The great ruler & founder of the Maratha kingdom, Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj visited the temple as he was a prominent devotee of her, people believe that the Goddess gifted him a sword - 'The Bhawani Talwar' - to succeed in his expeditions. Tulaja word indicates to an old Hindu monastery at Tolaja village in the present Rawalpindi division of Pakistan.  Temple  Along with temples of Renuka at Mahur, Mahalaxmi at Kolhapur, and Saptashringi at Vani, the temple of Bhavani at Tuljapur forms the four great Shaktipitha in Maharashtra. Many legends are associated with the temple. One legend involves a demon, Matanga who was wreaking havoc upon the gods and humans. Unable to find any solution, they turned to Lord Brahma for help, and upon his advice turned to Goddess Shakti, who took up the form of a destroyer and powered by the other (Sapta) Mata Varaahi, Brahmi, Vaishnavi, Kaumaari Indraani and Saambhavi, vanquished the demon Matanga and restored peace. Legend also states that Bhavani finished another demon that had taken up the disguise of a buffalo (Mahisha), and took shelter on the Yamunachala Hill which is part of Balaghat mountain range. The Tuljabhawani temple is located on this hill. Another legend mentions the story of a sage known as \\"Kardam\\" After his death his wife \\"Anubuti\\" had performed a penance at the banks of river \\"mandakini \\" for Bhavani mata to look after her infant child. While performing the penance the demon known \\"Kukur\\" tried to disturb her penance during which the Goddess came to the aid of \\"Anubuti\\" and killed the demon \\"Kukur\\". From that day onwards the Goddess Bhavani came to be known as Tulja Bhavani. The main entrance of the temple bears the name of Sardar Nimbalkar.

It connected Bala with Blaenau Ffestiniog.  History  The railway originally connected Bala with Llan Ffestiniog. It was incorporated on 28 July 1873 and opened on 1 November 1882. In 1883 the line was extended by converting the existing Festiniog and Blaenau Railway between Llan Ffestiniog and Blaenau Ffestiniog from gauge to standard gauge. The line terminated at Blaenau Ffestiniog (GWR) where until 1939 it connected with the Ffestiniog Railway to Porthmadog. At , the line connected with the Ruabon to Barmouth GWR line. The Bala and Festiniog was vested in the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1910. On nationalisation in 1948 management of the line passed to the Western Region of British Railways. The line closed to passengers in 1960 and to freight in 1961. An unusual feature of freight operation on the line was the carriage of gauge slate wagons (provided by the GWR) on standard gauge transporter wagons between and Blaenau Ffestiniog where the wagons were off-loaded in the large station yard and their loads of dressed slate transferred to standard gauge GWR wagons for carriage back the way they had come then on via Manod and Bala.

In 1982, the Ffestiniog Railway was reopened to a wholly new Blaenau Ffestiniog on the site of the former GWR station. Conwy Valley line services were extended along the 1964 connection to the new interchange station and Blaenau Ffestiniog North (LNWR) was closed.  Current status  The remains of a tramway linking to the BFR near Llyn Celyn The only part of the line in use today is the very short section between the two stations in Blaenau Ffestiniog. The section of line between Blaenau (GWR) and Trawsfynydd power station closed in 1998, although the track is protected and has remained in situ since. Much of the trackbed south of Trawsfynydd remains intact except for the section flooded by Llyn Celyn and some sections used to improve the A4212 road. Several other sections are open as permissive paths. Many of the former stations are now in use as private residences.  Heritage railway plans  Trawsfynydd Railway Company During 2016, the Trawsfynydd Railway Company was formed under the ownership of Colin Dale and with the use of volunteer labour, began to clear the line to Trawsfynydd Lake railway station which they proposed to be their terminus. They also intended to re- open Maentwrog Road, Llan Ffestiniog, a halt at Cwm Teigl and at Manod, en route. The clearing of the line was sanctioned by the owner of the trackbed, Network Rail and by 10 October 2016, more than six productive days had been achieved. Also, a bid was unsuccessfully made for DB Cargo's Class 08 locomotive No. 08757 from Crewe which would cost ¬£19,600. A crowd funding site was launched to this end. In August of 2017 Network Rail took the decision to revoke the licence issued to Trawsfynydd Railway Company for clearing the line following an investigation which found several breaches of the terms and conditions of the licence agreement. The company dissolved in December 2018 following the death of the owner.  Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd Railway Society A separate volunteer society, the Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd Railway Society, kept a watching brief in the background to the Trawsfynydd Railway Company. After it lost its licence to clear the line, the Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd Railway Society stepped in with the goal of developing its own plans to restore the line in a manner acceptable to Network Rail and other stakeholders. A new interim committee was formed through co- opting existing committee members from the Trawsfynydd Railway Company. It held its first and only AGM on 3 February 2019 to discuss how to take the next steps towards restoring the line. Plans included changing the Society into the Bala and Ffestiniog Railway Heritage Trust. Bala and Festiniog Railway Heritage Trust The outcome of the AGM was to disband the existing Blaenau Ffestiniog and Trawsfynydd Railway Society and replace it with a limited company named the Bala and Festiniog Railway Heritage Trust. It would be run by an elected committee which had the mandate to preserve the history of the old line between Bala and Ffestiniog and to explore options of how to restore the line between Trawsfynydd and Ffestiniog to operational use. Members of the committee reiterated that this would involve much paperwork before any tangible progress was made on the physical infrastructure once an agreement is obtained from Network Rail.

Club career During his career, which spanned from 1980 to 1996, Casagrande played for a number of clubs. He represented Corinthians, Caldense, S√£o Paulo, Flamengo, and Paulista F.C. in Brazil, Portuguese club FC Porto, and Italian clubs Ascoli and Torino F.C.. He won two S√£o Paulo State Championships with Corinthians n 1982 and 1983, while playing alongside S√≥crates, forming one of the greatest strike partnerships in the history of Brazilian football. He moved to Europe from his home country in 1986 to join Porto, winning a European Cup title in 1987 during his only season with the team. He subsequently joined Serie A side Ascoli later that year, where he remained for four seasons ‚Äì three of which were in Serie A and one in Serie B ‚Äì scoring 38 goals in 96 appearances, and becoming an idol with the club's fans. After the club was relegated to Serie B during the 1989‚Äì90 season, he remained with Ascoli and helped the team win promotion back to Serie A the following season, after which he left to join Torino. In his first season in Turin, he helped Torino to the 1992 UEFA Cup Final, scoring a goal in the first leg of the semi-finals against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium, as well as two more in the final; however, he was ultimately unable to prevent his side from losing to Ajax on away goals. Casagrande is also remembered by the club's fans for scoring a brace in a Turin Derby victory over rivals Juventus. In 1993, he helped the club win the Coppa Italia. In total he obtained 69 appearances during his time at the club under manager Emiliano Mondonico, scoring 19 goals. He later returned to Brazil in 1993, to play for Flamengo; that year, he was runner-up in the Supercopa Sudamericana with the club, losing in a penalty shootout to another Brazilian team, S√£o Paulo FC. He subsequently went on to have a second spell with Corinthians between 1994 and 1995; in total, he played 256 games and scored 102 goals for the latter club. Finally, he played for Paulista, and later S√£o Francisco, before ending his career in 1996. International career With the Brazil national football team, Casagrande played in 19 matches between April 1985 and June 1986, scoring nine goals. He was left off of the team that took part at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, but he played in three games during the 1986 FIFA World Cup.Walter Casagrande Statistics FIFA. Retrieved 2 February 2010. Style of play A tall and physically powerful striker, Casagrande usually played as a centre-forward. Although he was capable of scoring goals, and had a consistent goalscoring rate throughout his career, he was not the most prolific forward during his time in Italy; however, he was a hard-working team player, who usually acted in more of a supporting role, that is known as the \\"centravanti di manovra\\" (which literally translates to \\"manoeuvring centre-forward\\") in Italian football jargon, a precursor to the modern false-nine role, and was capable of operating across the entire front line. Although he lacked pace, he was known for his excellent technical ability, despite his large physique, as well as his ability to carry the ball. His height, strength, elevation, and heading accuracy enabled him to excel in the air, and saw him score several decisive goals from headers; he also possessed good link-up play, and was known for his ability to play the ball first time, lay it off to other players, or provide assists to teammates through knockdowns with his head or first‚Äìtime passes. Moreover, his physique enabled him to hold up the ball for other players when playing with his back to goal, while his movement allowed him either to provide depth for his team or create space for teammates with his runs off the ball. As such, he was also deployed as a second striker or as a central attacking midfielder on occasion. He was also an accurate free kick taker. Furthermore, his stature, combined with his long hair and beard, made him a highly recognisable figure on the pitch. Later life Following his retirement from professional football, Casagrande worked as an analyst for Globo. In September 2007, Casagrande was involved in a weekend traffic accident, and was briefly in a coma after his car rolled and hit parked cars. He was subsequently able to leave the intensive care unit and was breathing on his own. After the crash he described how he had become addicted to drugs since retiring, and that he had been undergoing drug treatment for the past seven months (since September 2007). In an interview with Radio Jovem Pan, Casagrande said he has been in a private drug-treatment clinic in S√£o Paulo since then. \\"When I retired, I felt a sensation of emptiness. I missed the adrenaline of the matches and practices and that led me to the compulsive use of drugs,\\" Casagrande said, adding that he became \\"addicted to heroin.\\" Casagrande, who played for Brazil at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, said he overdosed four times from 2005‚Äì07 and once almost went into a coma after using drugs. He is finishing in April 2008 his treatment. On 22 April 2013, Casagrande confessed on Programa do J√¥ that he was ashamed for doping four times while playing for F.C. Porto, during the 1986‚Äì87 season.http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Internacional/interior.aspx?content_id=817327http://abola.pt/nnh/ver.aspx?id=397057 Casagrande, suffered a heart attack on the morning of Friday, 29 May 2015. He has been sent to the ICU of TotalCor hospital in S√£o Paulo. Casagrande underwent angioplasty, a surgical intervention to unblock arteries. The hospital did not say whether he had to have a stent put in place, a device that facilitates the flow of blood in the arteries. Casagrande was vocally critical of the numerous Brazilian footballers who endorsed Jair Bolsonaro's 2018 presidential campaign, claiming that while many footballers had endorsed Bolsonaro, no one had said why or how Bolsonaro would improve Brazil.

It tells the story of an eastern European Jewish village's plan to escape the Holocaust.  Plot  The film starts off with a man, named Schlomo (Lionel Abelanski), running crazily through a forest, with his voice playing in the background, saying that he has seen the horror of the Nazis in a nearby town, and he must tell the others. Once he gets into town, he informs the rabbi, and together they run through the town and once they have got enough people together, they hold a town meeting. At first, many of the men do not believe the horrors they are being told, and many criticize Schlomo, for he is the town lunatic, and who could possibly believe him? But the rabbi believes him, and then they try to tackle the problem of the coming terrors. Amidst the pondering and the arguing, Schlomo suggests that they build a train, so they can escape by deporting themselves. Some of their members pretend to be Nazis in order to ostensibly transport them to a concentration camp, when in reality, they are going to Palestine via Russia. Thus the Train of Life is born. On their escape route through rural Eastern Europe, the train sees tensions between its inhabitants, close encounters with real Nazis as well as Communist partisans, and fraternization with the Roma, until the community arrives just at the frontlines between German and Soviet fire. Its ends with the voice-over of Schlomo himself, who tells the stories of his companions after the arrival of the train in the Soviet Union: Some went on to Palestine, some stayed in the Soviet Union, and some even made it to America. As he is telling this, a cut to a close-up of his face happens as he says, \\"That is the true story of my shtetl...\\", but then the camera makes a quick zoom-out, revealing him grinning and wearing prisoner's clothes behind the barbed wire of a concentration camp, and he ends with, \\"Ye nu, almost the true story!\\" Thus, it is implicated that he became mad because of having seen most of his companions exterminated, having made up the whole story for himself in his lunacy.

Train of Life Reviews, MovieFix MihƒÉileanu refuses to publicly discuss whether Benigni has plagiarized his film, instead preferring to say that he and Benigni have made \\"two very different films\\". Writer-director MihƒÉileanu said that reporters came to ask him about Shlomo's ultimate fate which the film leaves open, whether he will perish during the war or if he will survive. MihƒÉileanu said, \\"At first, I didn't know how to answer this one. But then I found the right answer: It's up to you in the audience! If you'll forget Shlomo, he'll die. But if you'll remember him, he'll live forever.\\"\\"\\"Ein Journalist hat mich gefragt: √úberlebt Schlomo den Krieg, der ja im Film noch nicht zu Ende ist? Am Anfang hat er mich mit seiner Frage √ºberrascht, doch dann habe ich die Antwort gefunden. Ich habe ihm gesagt: 'Das h√§ngt nicht von mir ab, das h√§ngt von Ihnen und vom Publikum ab.

Train of Life (Train de Vie), ReelViews.com While Jakob the Liar was near-universally panned, critics were divided upon which out of the other two worked better as a \\"Holocaust comedy.\\" While Desson Howe of the Washington Post called Train of Life a \\"less-than- scintillating spin on Life Is Beautiful\\",Howe, Desson (1999). Train of Life, Washington Post, November 19, 1999 James Berardinelli of ReelViews found the film's comedy \\"too 'French' in nature ‚Äî which is to say that it tends towards silliness and slapstick.\\" Rob Blackwelder of SlicedWire (while not opposed to the idea of Holocaust tragicomedies in general) found each of the three films suffering from their distinct own flaws.Blackwelder, Rob.

It sits on the water divide between the Kansas River and the Wakarusa River rivers. It was named after the long defunct Oread Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, where many of the settlers of Lawrence moved from prior to the American Civil War. The hill was originally called Hogback Ridge by many Lawrence residents until the Oread name was adopted in 1864, two years after the university was founded. For settlers going westward by wagon train on the Oregon Trail, \\"The Hill\\", as Mount Oread is now commonly referred to by Kansans, was the next big topographical challenge after crossing the Wakarusa River, which is today located two miles south of the city of Lawrence. The Oread, a hotel on Mount Oread, about one block south of the Old North College site. According to the United States Geological Survey, Mount Oread is located approximately above sea level. By way of comparison, downtown Lawrence is about above sea level. Mount Oread is perhaps best known for being the staging area of William Quantrill's raid into Lawrence on August 21, 1863, during the American Civil War. Presently, the campus of the University of Kansas (KU) rests on Mount Oread. Mount Oread is the type locality for the Oread Limestone, and so, gives its name to the Oread Escarpment rising in this region of Kansas. Oread Limestone was quarried from the hilltop and used in the earliest of the campus buildings of KU, including Spooner Hall and Dyche Hall.

The designated zone of production for the DOCG wines Roero and Roero Arneis is a subset of this territory which comprises the communes of Castellinaldo, Canale, Corneliano d‚ÄôAlba, Piobesi d‚ÄôAlba and Vezza d‚ÄôAlba, plus parts of Baldissero d'Alba, Castagnito, Guarene, Govone, Magliano Alfieri, Mont√†, Monteu Roero, Pocapaglia, Priocca, Santa Vittoria d'Alba, Santo Stefano Roero and Sommariva Perno.Map of production zone at regione.piemonte.it Extent The territory lies to the north of Alba. The river Tanaro marks its southern border, dividing it from the Langhe. To the north-east its informal boundary with Monferrato follows approximately the line of the border between the provinces of Cuneo and Asti, although Cisterna d‚ÄôAsti can be taken to be part of Roero. To the north-west it is confined by the province of Turin. To the west its border is taken to be the SS 661 state road which runs through the communes of Bra, Sanfr√® and Sommariva del Bosco.Dove si trova il Roero Coat of arms of the Roero family.

The Model 45 was the first all-new design since the original Learjet, and significantly altered the Learjet line. Through its four primary variants ‚Äì the original Model 45, the Model 45XR, Model 40 and Model 40XR ‚Äì it was the Learjet Division's principal product from the 1990s until the introduction of the Model 75 variant in 2012.George, Fred, \\"Used Aircraft Report: Learjet 45/45 XR: Fast, efficient, reliable and now less maintenance-intensive,\\" Mar 28, 2017, Business & Commercial Aviation, retrieved April 10, 2017 History Development and production on ground The Model 45 was developed in the 1990s as a competitor in the \\"super-light\\" business jet category, a rival to the popular Cessna Citation Excel / XLS ‚Äì but sacrificing the Cessna's stand-up room for the Learjet family's traditional high-speed performance. The Model 45 was Learjet's first completely new (\\"clean sheet\\") design since the company's first aircraft (all other models having been evolved from the original 1963 Learjet design, the Model 23). The Model 45 was developed to make Learjets fundamentally more competitive against newer designs from competing manufacturers. But, as a clean-sheet design (starting from scratch), being built to more rigorous (FAR Part 25) rules, than previous Learjets, the aircraft's development took substantially greater time than the development of previous Learjet models. The development of the LJ45 began in 1989, but was not announced by Bombardier until September, 1992. First flight of the prototype aircraft took place on October 7, 1995 ‚Äì the 32nd anniversary of the first flight of the original Learjet 23. FAA certification was delayed, and finally granted in September 1997, with the first customer aircraft subsequently delivered in mid-1998. The aviation magazine Flying reported that the Lear 45 was first certified under FAR Part 25 (transport category rules) in 1998. Initially, delays in production resulted in frustrated customers and lost or delayed revenues. Some customers' orders were delayed more than two years. Deliveries and difficulties in flight By late 2006, Learjet had delivered over 300 Model 45s (40 of which were its improved version, the Model 45XR). By November 2010, over 500 of the Model 45 and 45XR, had been delivered. Initially, numerous mechanical and electrical problems began appearing in the aircraft after delivery ‚Äì including cracked windshields, problems with pressurization, fried power distribution panels, and inappropriate alarms. These and other problems commonly forced Model 45 operators to ground their aircraft about once a month, limiting their use. Problems came to a head in August 2003, when the FAA discovered a defective fastener for the Model 45's horizontal stabilizer could break, sending the airplane into a fatal dive. The FAA grounded all Learjet 45s, across the nation, and they all sat on the ground for a month, while the manufacturer struggled to develop a fix and get it to aircraft in the field. By 2007, Model 45 operators were said to have a \\"love-hate\\" relationship with the aircraft ‚Äì appreciating its exceptional combination of performance, payload and economics, but frustrated by frequent maintenance problems, often grounding the aircraft, and difficulty getting prompt and adequate product support and parts.Gilbert, Gordon, \\"2005 AIN Product Support Report,\\" October 4, 2006, Aviation International News, retrieved April 5, 2017 However, 10 years later, a 2017 \\"Used Aircraft Report\\" by Business & Commercial Aviation magazine indicated that owners now regard the aircraft as \\"gas-and-go airplane\\" and credit it \\"with great reliability,\\" and the article's author, B/CA senior editor Fred George, describes it as \\"a rock-solid reliable workhorse.\\" By 2018, Learjet 45/45XRs were priced at $1.5‚Äì4.9 million. Design and manufacturing flat-floor cabin flight deck In size, the LJ45 and LJ45XR fit between the smaller Learjet 31 and Learjet 40, at the low end, and the larger Learjet 60 at the top of the Learjet product line. It offers the operating economics typical of a \\"light\\" business jet, but the performance and comfort of a \\"mid-size\\" business jet. It has a range at Mach 0.81 with four passengers on board. The plane was designed around a flat-floor cabin, with a non- circular cross-section for additional headroom. Typical interior configuration is eight passenger seats, in a double-club seating arrangement, and a fully enclosed toilet (usable as a 9th seat) and an adjoining 15-cubic-foot baggage area. An external 50-cubic-foot baggage area is also provided. The Model 45 was Learjet's first \\"clean-sheet\\" (all-new) design since the development of the original Model 23. (All previous models had been derivatives of the Model 23, with the wide-fuselage Model 55 and Model 60 utilizing the basic wing design originating in the Model 23, but with extensions and winglets; some however, view the Model 55 as a \\"clean sheet\\" design, also.) Previous Learjet designs had used rigorous, extensive \\"fail-safe\\" structures in the wing and tail assemblies, with numerous wing spars providing a highly reinforced structure (derived from the Swiss-designed P-16 prototype fighter that was the original basis for the first Learjet) ‚Äì but the Model 45, instead, used a lighter, less-robust structure, affording less cost in manufacture and lower aircraft empty weights, resulting in improved capacity, efficiency and some performance enhancement (for a given amount of engine power), at a competitive price. Outwardly, however, the Model 45 retained the traditional Learjet appearance, with its semi-swept wing, T-tail, sharp nose, and wrap-around windshield ‚Äì while using engines and avionics similar to those in the Model 60. It also incorporated two conspicuous modifications pioneered on earlier Learjets: the \\"delta fins\\" (twin ventral fins, positioned to help stabilize the aircraft in flight, and help right the aircraft in a deep aerodynamic stall) ‚Äì and winglets (upturned wingtips to reduce induced drag and improve stability). Among other characteristics, the design has reportedly yielded the most benign stall characteristics of any \\"light\\" business jet to date (as of 2017). The Model 45 cockpit is equipped with a four-screen Honeywell Primus 1000 EFIS avionics system., however it uses obsolete CRT screens, rather than modern LCD screens ‚Äì resulting substantial maintenance costs (though a $300,000 LCD-display upgrade is available). The aircraft is powered by two DEEC-controlled Honeywell TFE731-20-AR turbofan engines, rated at 3,500 pounds thrust, each, in sea-level temperatures up to 88 ¬∞F ‚Äì a fuel-efficient, \\"understressed,\\" derated version of the 4,435 lb thrust TFE731-40 ‚Äì developed specifically for the Learjet 45. Recommended engine TBO (Time Between Overhauls) is 5,000 hours. At normal atmospheric conditions, zero-wind takeoff runway requirements range from 4,200 feet (for a stripped, basic plane with a basic operating weight of 11,700 pounds) to 5,040 feet for a fully equipped model, with auxiliary power unit and other upgrades (14,200 lbs). However, the engine exhibits poor performance in high-density altitude situations (such as takeoff from hot, humid or high-elevation airports), often resulting in long runway requirements. (Engine power deficiency in high-density altitudes was largely resolved by the engine upgrade to the -20BR engine variant in the Learjet 45XR variant of the Learjet 45 ‚Äì an engine upgrade which is also available as a retrofit to the older Learjet 45, and widely recommended.) An internal auxiliary power unit, for ground use, provides electrical and pneumatic power, permits easy starts, without ground power units, and enables aircraft cooling or heating while on the ground, without the engines operating. However, the auxiliary power unit was initially optional, rather than standard, equipment. The wing has 13 degrees of wing sweep with a supercritical airfoil optimized for cruise flight at Mach 0.78. Though there are no leading-edge slats or wing fences, the wing has vortilons on the leading edge, to avoid spanwise flow, and small metal triangles on the leading edge to minimize airflow separation during flight at a high angle of attack. The Lear 45 was certified under FAR Part 25 (transport category rules), rather than FAR Part 23 (often used in earlier business jets). The stricter Part 25 certification requires greater system redundancy, and requires that the airplane reliably meets the performance numbers published in the aircraft's FAA-approved Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH). Dual-wheel, trailing link, main landing gear is provided, with digital nosewheel steering facilitating tight turns. Single-point pressure refueling is also provided, expediting turnarounds. De Havilland Canada builds the LJ45's wings, and Bombardier subsidiary Short Brothers of Belfast, Northern Ireland, builds the fuselage and empennage. Variants Model 45XR Learjet 45XR at the 2007 Paris Air Show The Learjet 45XR is an upgraded version of the Model 45, introduced in June 2004, offering substantially higher takeoff weights, faster cruise speeds and faster time-to-climb rates than the Model 45, chiefly through modifications to the engine. The XR allowed a gross weight 1,000 pounds greater than the original Model 45, greatly increasing payload and fuel/range options. The aircraft also has exceptionally short runway requirements for mid-size bizjets, capable of loaded flights from 4,000-foot runways. The 45XR's performance and specifications increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration, flat-rated to 3,500 pounds thrust, even at 104 degrees Fahrenheit, well above the 88-degree mark for that power from the original Model 45's TFE731-20 engines.\\"Bombardier Aerospace Launches Learjet 40XR High Performance Light Jet.\\" from Wings over Kansas The Model 45 cockpit is equipped with a four-screen Honeywell Primus 1000 EFIS avionics system, with TCAS and EGPWS. LJ45 owners can upgrade their aircraft through the incorporation of several service bulletins. . Model 40 The Model 40, first delivered in 2003, is a two-foot (24.5 inches) shorter variant of the Model 45, with less passenger room, but otherwise comparable characteristics and performance data. The model 40 also lacked an APU or Auxiliary Power Unit. Model 40XR The Model 40XR, introduced in 2004, is a higher-performance variant of the Model 40, with the same modifications as used to convert the Model 45 into the Model 45XR. Model 75 The Learjet Model 75 variant, first delivered in 2012, is essentially a Model 45XR with more modern engines, engine systems, and Garmin 5000 avionics, and more efficient winglets.George, Fred, \\"Operators Survey: Bombardier Learjet 70/75: Strong resurgence of the last Learjet,\\" Mar 28, 2017, Business & Commercial Aviation, retrieved April 10, 2017 The Model 75's Honeywell TFE731-40BR engines yield 10% more takeoff thrust (3,850 pounds) than the -20BR engines powering the Model 45XR, cutting required runway length 12%, allowing a sea- level, standard-day takeoff within 4,440 ft., (versus the Model 45XR's fully equipped need for 5,040 ft). In these conditions, the Model 75 can take off from a 4,500-foot runway, with a full load of passengers and fuel, and fly 1,800 nautical miles (2,070 statute miles). As with the original Model 45, the Model 75 was initially delivered in a stripped-down form, with many features only offered as options, rather than as standard equipment). However, the aircraft does come equipped with an auxiliary power unit, and thrust reversers (rare in light business jets). Early units had minor quality problems and defects. The Model 75 was first FAA-certified in 2013, and took the place of the Model 45XR, becoming the division's principal product. Since 2015 (as of 2017), it is the division's only product.McMillin, Molly, \\"Bombardier's Learjet 75 gets FAA certification,\\" November 15, 2013, Wichita Eagle, retrieved April 5, 2017 Model 70 The Model 70, introduced in 2013, is a shortened variant of the Model 75 ‚Äì alternatively described as an upgraded Model 40XR, with the same modifications as used to convert the Model 45XR into the Model 75. It was far less popular than the Model 75, and was dropped from the Learjet line in 2015. Accidents and incidents * 2008 Mexico City plane crash; On 4 November 2008, Mexican Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mouri√±o, Assistant Attorney General Jos√© Luis Santiago Vasconcelos and 7 others were killed in an accident involving a Learjet 45. The aircraft crashed on a busy road, killing another 7 people on the ground. Investigators determined that the pilots had been flying too close to a 767 and lost control after flying into the larger plane's wake turbulence. * August 2003, a defective fastener for the Model 45's horizontal stabilizer failed in flight, creating the risk of a crash, which was averted. This event led to the FAA issuing an Airworthiness Directive grounding all Learjet 45s, nationwide, for a month, while the manufacturer developed a fix and got it out to aircraft in the field. * June 1, 2003, approximately 1426 local time, a Learjet 45, registration number I-ERJC, operated by Eurojet Italia, crashed shortly after take-off from Milano Linate Airport in Milan, Italy. The airplane reportedly struck a flock of birds shortly after takeoff and crashed into an industrial building while attempting to return to airport. The 2 crew members aboard received fatal injuries.Accident Report: NTSB Identification: DCA03WA037,\\" National Transportation Safety Board, citing the foreign investigating agency, Italy's Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV); retrieved April 10, 2017 * On 4 April 2018, a Wells Fargo Learjet 45XR (N618CW) was substantially damaged at William P.

Geography  Arganda del Rey as seen from the Sentinel-2 of the European Space Agency. Located in the central part of the Iberian Peninsula, the city lies at roughly 613 metres above sea level, not far from the junction of the Jarama and Manzanares rivers. It has been ascribed either to the Comarca de Alcal√° or the Alcarria de Alcal√° natural regions. It is connected to Madrid by metro line 9, underground. History The first permanent dwelling does not date back to the Arab presence in the Iberian Peninsula as it has been suggested. archaeological Remains from the earlier Roman era have been found, and some philologists argue that the name of the municipality comes from the Latin area canda (\\"white area\\"). In the Roman texts of Ptolemy several cities are mentioned as pre-Roman habitations (Carpetanos) with Alternia (Arganda) among them. In the 11th century, Arganda was the home of the king of Spain for 20 years. It was conquered by the Christians, but there was no notable population expansion until the 14th century. The majority of historians believe that the population increase was due to the pestilence of 1348. Until 1581, Arganda belonged to the archbishopric of Toledo. Philip II granted the title of Villa to the population, but the municipality's economic problems led to it being sold to the Raul Delgado in 1613. The people rebelled in what is known as Arganda's Riot. The municipality grew due to the wine industry and the construction of a railroad that connected Arganda to Madrid in 1843. The beginning of the 20th century saw the development of a sugar plantation, which started a process of industrialization and of great demographic expansion. The Battle of Jarama took place near the town. In the 1960s, industrial growth brought another population explosion. In 1960, Arganda had 6,000 inhabitants, and this grew to 22,000 inhabitants in 1981. The majority of the expansion came from the immigration of people of Andalusian and Extremaduran origin. More recently another inflow of migrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, has led to a population in excess of 50,000 inhabitants. Arganda del Rey is one of the most indebted councils of Spain, owing over ‚Ç¨100m, mainly owing to money wasted on secret projects from the previous Partido Popular-led council. This includes an underground sports centre that was built by construction companies tied in with the G√ºrtel case which was completely hidden to the public, abandoned since 2008 and only recently discovered, and which cost ‚Ç¨12m instead of the budgeted ‚Ç¨2m.  Tourism   Historical buildings  * Church of San Juan Bautista, built between 1696 and 1714, mixing gothic, renaissance and baroque styles. This is one of the best conserved churches around the area. Its fa√ßade can be seen in Bu√±uel's film, Viridiana, as exteriors were filmed here. * Hermitage of Valtierra, in Valtierra's former medieval village. It was built in Mud√©jar style in the first half of the 13th century.

History Learjet 24B registered in France and operated by a corporate owner. Athens Airport 1973 The Learjet 24 was designed as an improved version of the Learjet 23, which was limited to gross weight. Engineers designed the model 24 to accept up to the full gross weight permitted by FAR-25 standards. Other improvements introduced in the Learjet 24 included: * increased cabin pressurization, to allow a higher operating altitude * the addition of one extra window on the right side of the cabin * more powerful engines * a new windshield * auxiliary fuel in wing tip tanks * a fire-extinguishing system for the engines With these changes, the LJ24 became the first business jet to be certified under FAR-25. The first flight of a Learjet 24 took place on January 24, 1966. From May 23 to 26, 1966, a Learjet 24 flew around the world in 50 hours and 20 minutes flying time as a demonstration of its capabilities. Different variants were the 24A, B, C, D, E and F, with changes of takeoff weight, in-fuselage fuel tank, range, cabin and engines. Altogether 259 Model 24s were built, and in 2001, there were still 210 Learjet 24s in use. Thirty-nine LJ24s have been lost through accidents. Noise compliance In 2013, the FAA modified 14 CFR part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not stage 3 noise compliant after December 31, 2015. The Learjet 24 is listed explicitly in Federal Register 78 FR 39576. Any Learjet 24s that have not been modified by installing Stage 3 noise compliant engines or have not had \\"hushkits\\" installed for non-compliant engines will not be permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after December 31, 2015. 14 CFR ¬ß91.883 Special flight authorizations for jet airplanes weighing 75,000 pounds or less ‚Äì lists special flight authorizations that may be granted for operation after December 31, 2015.

His real name was Eiichi Maita.  Biography  Gyosh≈´ was born in the plebeian downtown district of Asakusa in Tokyo. He studied traditional painting techniques as an apprentice to Matsumoto Fuko from the age of 15. When he was 17, his talent was recognized by Shik≈ç Imamura, who invited him to join the Kojikai circle of leading young artists. With the revival of the Japan Fine Arts Academy (Nihon Bijutsuin), Gyosh≈´ became a founding member. He worked in many schools of painting, including Yamato-e, Rinpa and Bunjinga, with his style evolving gradually towards a detailed realism influenced also by his studies of Chinese paintings from the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty. His later works evolved further towards Symbolism. In 1914, Gyosh≈´ formed a group called Sekiyokai to study new styles of Japanese painting. He had a leg amputated after being hit by a train in 1919, but the incident did not affect his artistic output. He devoted himself to creation, submitting numerous works to the Inten Exhibition, as well as touring Europe in 1930. His flower and bird drawings in India ink painting style and his portraits were especially well received by art critics. His most famous work, dates from 1925. It was the first art work of the Sh≈çwa period to be accorded the status of Important Cultural Property (ICP) by the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs. Gyosh≈´ died suddenly from typhoid fever in 1935 at the age of 40. Over 104 of his paintings were collected by the Yamatane Museum in Tokyo. One of Gyosh≈´'s works, Dance of Flames, was selected as the subject of a commemorative postage stamp as part of the Japanese government's Modern Art Series in 1979.

Publication history The U-Men are a collection of characters that first appeared in Grant Morrison's run on New X-Men where they were created by Grant Morrison and Leinil Francis Yu. They believe in using mutant body parts to augment their human bodies as well as to grant themselves superhuman powers. They also live in specially designed environment suits to protect them from what they believe to be an imperfect world. Until his death, they were led by John Sublime. Fictional history A group of U-Men track down a young girl named Angel Salvadore, who manifested fly-related mutant powers. They are about to dissect her in a mobile-lab by the side of the road when Wolverine finds them and attacks, having been searching for Angel with the help of Jean Grey. All the soldiers are killed and Angel is taken into the care of the X-Men. A little after Angel is rescued, a squadron of U-Men attack through the front gate of the X-Mansion. Jean Grey is the only X-Man on the premises, but with the help of several of the students, such as one who could manifest voices from any direction, she was able to keep the U-Men at bay. The U-Men have many counter- abilities to mutant powers, such as being able to shut down portions of their mind in order to escape telepathic control by the Stepford Cuckoos. Jean manages to both humiliate the U-Men with her telepathy and defeat them with her regrowing Phoenix powers. As Wolverine and Angel draw up to the mansion, the U-Men are seen running away, screaming into the night as Jean telekinetically destroys their suits and attacks them with psychic fire. The U-Men are next seen when the first Xorn takes his remedial class, which includes Angel, out on a special camping trip. They are attacked by U-Men forces. Xorn was drawn away, leaving the class to face down a lone U-Men soldier. The students defeat him and Angel, sent to search for Xorn, discovers that Xorn had slain the rest of the force. Kid Omega and his gang, high on the mutant drug Kick, made a planned attack on a U-Men stronghold, destroying it and killing the men. A U-man is also seen being killed by angry mutants in Planet X. \\"The Third Species\\" religion The U-Men were primarily led by Dr. John Sublime until his death. Individuals view his book, The Third Species, to be their bible and the practice of being a U-Man as a legitimate religion, though others, such as mutants, view them as a cult.New X-Men vol. 2 #136 U-Man life and philosophy The Third Species presents Sublime's philosophy that the current world is \\"tainted\\" and that followers must not be exposed to the air or touch the earth of the \\"fallen world\\" until it has been perfected, hence the special suits. They eat only processed, specialized foods that are deemed \\"clean,\\" and their suits have automatic waste recycling. They must pay for these suits themselves. They carry weapons used for harvesting mutants, such as propulsion guns that fire razors or bullets. U-Men act in groups, composed of a \\"central base\\", group leaders, and subordinates. They communicate through standard forms of technology and go out into hunting missions to harvest mutants. They often refer to John Sublime's website for guidance and questions. Sublime's book states that there is a \\"third species\\" on Earth called Homo perfectus or \\"the Recycled Man\\". The so-called \\"Third Species\\" is composed of normal humans who believe it is their right to use mutants and mutant parts to give themselves \\"chosen mutant\\" abilities. They do this by capturing mutants and harvesting their organs or other body parts to use either as grafts and implants (such as eyes with x-ray vision or blood transfusions that grant electrical abilities) or as tools (such as Martha the Mutant Brain). Like normal grafts and implants, the mutant organs do not always take, and some U-Men die as a result of the process, such as U-Man Bob Smitt, who died of blood poisoning when his mutant lung grafts rotted inside him. U-Men view the failure of a graft to take as a measure of an individual's \\"purity\\" and deservedness to be one of the Third Species. When a U-Man dies, the other members of his or her team congregate for a short ceremony and then harvest the deceased U-Man's grafted mutant organs for themselves. In doing so, they believe that the fallen U-Man (as well as the mutants whose organs they harvest) will continue to live within them, a form of genetic immortality. Associations The U-Men are often viewed as a cult of \\"geeks\\" or other young, social outcasts who are easily swayed by the radical philosophy found in John Sublime's book. The Third Species and the U-Men gain public attention when a high schooler holds up a school assembly with a gun and announces to the world that he had killed a school jock, a closeted mutant and gay, for the purpose of harvesting his x-ray vision eyes. The announcement, and his declared intent to join the U-Men and have the eyes transplanted is broadcast on the news. He is subsequently shot and killed by police. Despite their seemingly small and radical stigma, the U-Man organization is much larger, possibly due to John Sublime's wealth and fame. The X-Men investigate an issue in Hong Kong and discover a massive illegal mutant organ smuggling operation within John Sublime's Sublime Pharm Solutions building.New X-Men vol. 1 Annual 2001 The building houses several captured mutants, some of which have been operated on and left to die. The facility is massive and contains sophisticated technology and surgical equipment. Other versions Here Comes Tomorrow In Here Comes Tomorrow, an apocalyptic alternate future time line, the last U-Man is known as Apollyon the Destroyer, who serves as a herald for \\"The Beast\\" (a Sublime-possessed Hank McCoy).New X-Men #151 Having suffered several injuries and still being \\"perfected\\" with different grafts, Apollyon awaits the day when he will be grafted with the \\"Phoenix gene\\" and will become perfect and able to walk on a \\"perfected world.\\" However, when the Phoenix gene is harvested, Apollyon discovers that the Beast lied to him and intends to harvest the Phoenix gene for himself.New X-Men #152 When a reawoken Jean Grey extracts the intelligent bacterial entity Sublime from Beast, Apollyon strikes and decapitates Beast out of vengeance. Delusional and believing the world to now be perfected, Apollyon rips off his mask, revealing a face that is horribly disfigured.New X-Men #154 Despite this, the dying E.V.A. recognizes him and calls out, suggesting that Apollyon's true identity is that of Fantomex.New X-Men #153 In other media Television * The U-Men appear as the initial antagonists of Marvel Anime: X-Men.Watch the X-Men Anime Japanese Teaser Trailer X-Men News Marvel.com Here, they are portrayed as a human supremacist group led by Sublime (but backed by a disguised Mastermind of the Inner Circle) who are trying to harvest mutant body parts/powers similar to their comic book counterparts.

Written by David Mills from a story by Ed Burns & David Mills, and directed by Christine Moore, it originally aired on September 17, 2006. Plot At City Hall, Herc stumbles across Mayor Royce receiving oral sex from his secretary. Concerned for his career, Herc approaches Carver for advice about the situation, but Carver says the problem is beyond his pay grade and suggests they take it to Major Stan Valchek, who has more experience with politics. Valchek meets with Herc and reassures him that he could climb in rank if he keeps quiet about the incident, and can use the information against Royce if the mayor moves to punish him. Wilson visits Carcetti's house and finds him playing Battleship with his daughter, having assumed he has already lost the race for mayor. Carcetti meets with members of the Fraternal Order of Police, who admit that they are reluctant to endorse him with Royce leading in the polls. Carcetti convinces them to hold back their active support for Royce. As they leave, Valchek tells him that he achieved the best outcome possible under the circumstances. Wilson urges Carcetti to prepare for his debate with Royce, but the candidate remains pessimistic. Royce considers moving Herc out of his security detail and checks with Parker to see if he has friends high up in the department. In prison, Namond and his mother De'Londa visit his father Wee-Bey, who asks how Namond's work with Bodie is progressing; De'Londa threatens to withhold money for Namond's school supplies if he doesn't commit himself to Bodie. Back in the neighborhood, Namond and Michael ask if the latter and his younger brother can work for Bodie to earn money for school supplies. When Bodie refuses to employ them both, Namond suggests that Michael could take his job until he has the funds he needs. Carver and Bunk drive up, still looking for Lex; Bodie promises to contact them if he sees Lex, knowing that he is probably dead. While Namond and Michael meet their friends, Stanfield lieutenant Monk Metcalf arrives and hands out money. When Michael refuses to accept the money, Marlo confronts Michael and is impressed by his defiance. Donut pulls up in a stolen SUV, but the boys are spotted by Carver and forced to flee. Randy is caught by Officer Eddie Walker, who confiscates his money for school. Carver warns the boys against stealing more cars. Namond returns home to find that his mother has laid out new clothes for him despite her threats. Bunk pressures Lex's mother to give up her son's whereabouts, believing that Lex has fled from the police. Back at Homicide, Norris investigates what turns out to be the murder of a state's witness; Sergeant Jay Landsman informs Valchek about the case. At the MCU, Freamon prepares to serve subpoenas on political figures in connection with the Barksdale investigation. Sydnor and Pearlman are both worried that the move will hurt their careers. Pearlman realizes that Freamon played her by holding the investigation until now and that he lied when he said it was pushed back by fresh cases. Freamon serves developer Andy Krawczyk and State Senator Clay Davis, which are delivered by Greggs and Sydnor respectively. Davis and Krawczyk threaten to withhold financial support from Royce, who in turn puts pressure on Commissioner Ervin Burrell. Burrell and Deputy Commissioner William Rawls realize that Freamon is the cause of the problem, with Rawls resolving to find a way to remove Freamon from the MCU. Freamon and Greggs catch Marlo's voice on the wire and, knowing that his crew has not been linked to any violence, wonder why they hear what sounds like target practice in the background. At his gym, Dennis \\"Cutty\\" Wise continues to train one-time drug dealer Justin, who is preparing for an upcoming bout. Cutty is approached by the mothers of multiple students who hope to get a date with him. Cutty pays special attention to Michael, who fights with Justin after he interrupts his time using the heavy bag with Namond. Cutty breaks up the boys and offers to personally train Michael, but he declines. Meanwhile, Bubbles and his young prot√©g√© Sherrod continue to make their living selling goods from a shopping cart. Sherrod struggles to add up the price of their wares and Bubbles criticizes him for his poor math skills. Bubbles tries to hide his drug use from Sherrod, who is worried about Bubbles' criticism and tells him that he is willing to go back to school. In preparation for the school year, Prez cleans up his classroom and meets with the other teachers to discuss maintaining class rules. Assistant Principal Donnelly tasks one of her students, Crystal Judkins, to deliver secondhand school supplies to Dukie. Bubbles and Sherrod come to the school to discuss possible enrollment for Sherrod; Bubbles has a moment of recognition as he passes Prez. Despite being distracted, Carcetti is able to come up with effective answers as part of his debate preparation. He gets a visit from Valchek and is told about the death of the witness, giving him useful ammunition against Royce. During the televised debate, both Carcetti's campaign team and the Homicide unit watch as Carcetti rebuts Royce's assertion that Baltimore's crime rate has fallen by bringing up the murdered witness. Royce's response is labored, defensive, awkward, and evasive; Carcetti's team is pleased while Royce's people seem worried. Burrell and Rawls become nervous about their failure to inform the mayor about the murder. Production Simon has commented that the influx of child actors initially caused some problems on set and said that crew members' feelings mirrored the turmoil of Prez in the episode because of the young actors' behavior. However, by the end of filming they became a good crew of young actors. Title reference The title is a mysterious piece of advice that a colleague gives Prez about teaching (\\"You need soft eyes\\"). In the later episode \\"Refugees\\" that expression is used again and explained by Bunk Moreland. In terms of the title, the meaning of soft eyes means the ability to look deeper than what you first see. Epigraph Carcetti makes this statement when worrying about his chances in the upcoming election being hamstrung by his race. In 2000, Baltimore's population was 31% white.\\"Baltimore, MD Ethnicity\\" ERsys.com. (Based on U.S. Census, 2000). Retrieved 12/05/14. Credits Starring cast Although credited, Michael K.

ECWA is a partner church of the international Christian mission organisation, Serving In Mission (SIM), formerly Sudan Interior Mission. ECWA was founded in 1954 when the SIM-related churches (initially in Nigeria) came together to form an indigenous body. Since that time, mission stations, Bible Schools, academic schools, and medical programs have been transferred to ECWA leadership. History The Evangelical Church of West Africa was renamed \\"Evangelical Church Winning All\\" (ECWA) because of its wide spread beyond its initial scope. It was as a result of a history of ministry and the wide spread gospel of Jesus Christ in Africa by several missionaries, (Walter Gowans, Thomas Kent, and Rowland Bingham) who came from different parts of Canada and the United States of America in 1893 on what can be termed \\"evangelical suicide mission\\", a statement which was coined by Oji Chukwudimma Chukwudike because West Africa, at that time, was known to be heavily infested by malaria and there is almost a 100% possibility that a white man will not survive it as they even called the West African region \\"the white man's grave.\\" These missionaries braved malaria and yellow fever to preach the gospel of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ under the auspices of the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM) and planted several churches as they preached along like Paul the Apostle and around mid-20th century these churches became independent to carry on the gospel. ECWA has the largest mission organization of any African church living up to its name Evangelical the Evangelical Mission Society (EMS) has sent out about 1,600 missionaries. Throughout Nigeria, especially in the central regions, ECWA churches are growing rapidly. Some churches have experienced as much as 400% growth in the last several years. Churches in the Northern parts of the country are also growing. There are currently more than six thousand ECWA congregations with more than ten million members. ECWA has over ninety District Church Councils (DCC's) hundreds of Local Church Councils (LCC's), thousands of Local Churches (LCs) and hundreds of Prayer Houses (PHs). Bingham University, Karu was started in 2005 as a way of meeting the soaring need for not only quality, secular education, but education that recognizes and integrates the moral and spiritual values of the Christian faith that fueled its establishment. ECWA started three Theological Seminaries: ECWA Theological Seminary, Igbaja that started as a School of Prophets in 1918, ECWA Theological Seminary, Kagoro was established in 1931, and Jos ECWA Theological Seminary in 1980. There are also eight Bible colleges and fifteen theological training institutes. ECWA's Medical Department coordinates a wide network which includes four hospitals, a Community Health Program with over 110 health clinics, a Central Pharmacy and the School of Nursing and Midwifery. It is also involved in radio, publications for outreach and discipleship, rural development, urban ministries, and cross-cultural missions. There are more than 1600 missionaries from ECWA churches who serve in Nigeria and other countries with the Evangelical Missionary Society (EMS), the missionary arm of ECWA. There has been a serious confrontation between evangelical Christians standing in opposition to the expansion of Sharia law in northern Nigeria by militant Muslims since 1999.Terence O.

He is said to have been very much like his grandfather, to the extent that he may be a jana avatar, the avatar of Vishnu. The four are considered to be Vishnu-tattva or Vishnu's plenary expansions. It has been also used as one of the names of Lord Shiva.  Marriage to Rochana  Aniruddha's marriage to Rochana is described in the 61st Chapter of the 10th Canto of the Bhagavata Purana. Rukmi requested Krishna and Rukmini to have Aniruddha marry Rochana, Rukmi's granddaughter. When the marriage ceremony was arranged, Rukmi was killed by Lord Balarama after the former tried to insult the latter by cheating in a game of Pagade (dice).  Marriage to Usha  Aniruddha, holding a sword and a shield, in the Kondamotu Vrishni heroes relief, 4th century CE. As per Srimad Bhagavatam, a Daitya princess named Usha, daughter of Banasura (sometimes called Bana), fell in love with Aniruddha in her dream. As per the artistic description of Usha's dream, Chitralekha, her friend, drew pictures of many princes. Usha recognized Aniruddha among them. Chitralekha brought Aniruddha by her magic influence to Usha's palace in the latter's father's city of Sonitpura in Assam. However, according to some legends, Shonitpur is also identified with Sarahan in the Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. Going by their legends, Pradyumna was made the king of Shonitpur & subsequently the Bushahr state by Lord Krishna himself. Banasura sent guards to seize him, but the valiant youth, taking an iron club, slew his assailants. Banasura then brought his magic powers to bear and secured him. On discovering that Aniruddha had been carried away, Krishna, Balarama, and Pradyumna went to rescue him. Banasura was a great devotee of the god Shiva and had 1000 arms, as a result of which no one had ever been willing to fight him. Blinded by his pride, he asked Shiva to give him a chance to fight with someone as strong as himself. Shiva, therefore, scolded him that he would be defeated in war and his arrogance would be destroyed. Usha dreaming of Aniruddha After a month, Krishna came to know where his grandson was, after Narada told him. The Yadus launched an attack on Banasura with their army. Thus a great battle was fought. (See Canto 10, Chapter 63 of Srimad Bhagavatam) When the army laid siege to his city, Banasura staged a fierce counter-attack. At this point, Shiva joined the battle against Krishna because he had promised protection to Banasura. Krishna himself defeated Shiva with a weapon that put Shiva to sleep. After many of his warriors were defeated, Bana took up arms against Krishna. Krishna fought back with his powerful weapon Sudarshana Chakra and kept on chopping off one arm after another of Bana till he was left with only four arms. After this Shiva came and requested Lord Krishna not to kill Bana. Then Lord Krishna replied, In gratitude, King Bana bowed to lotus feet of Krishna.

Pradyumna and Aniruddha died in the intoxicated brawl between the Yadavas, which claimed the life of every Yadava prince, except Vajra who was the only survivor. Arjuna took the Yadava wives and the other survivors (older family members) to the city of Indraprashta, and crowned Vajra as the king.  Rebirth  According to Shiva Purana, Aniruddha and Usha reborn again as Lakshindar and Behula and in next life married each other again.it is mentioned in Padma Purana.

Spital Tongues is a historic area of Newcastle upon Tyne, located north west of the city centre. Its unusual name is believed to be derived from spital ‚Äì a corruption of the word hospital that is quite commonly found in British place names (for example Spitalfields) - and tongues, meaning outlying pieces of land. Edward I gave two such tongues of land to the St Mary Magdalene Hospital. St Mary Magdalene Hospital The first St Mary Magdalene Hospital was founded in the 12th century to care for victims of leprosy, the disease having been brought into Britain by the returning Crusaders. This was sited well outside the town, close to the present-day site of Lloyds TSB bank at the northern end of Northumberland Street. The St Mary Magdalene Hospital was a hospital in the medieval rather than the modern sense, concerned not with curing but with caring. Today, such an establishment would be called an almshouse. In 1874, the hospital was moved to a new location behind the Hancock Museum, before in turn being replaced in 1959 by 38 purpose-built bungalows in Spital Tongues. These properties are still collectively known as St Mary Magdalene Hospital. In 1884 the St Mary Magdalene charity opened the Home for Incurables in Moor Lodge, Spital Tongues. Moor Lodge had been built on land that had belonged to the charity for centuries. The charity had previously leased the house and grounds to William Hunter (the coal owner after whom the nearby Hunters Moor was named), so had to pay ¬£500 for the surrender of the lease at this time. A new home, still extant today, was designed by the architect Edward Shrewbrook and opened with great ceremony in 1893. This occupied the site of the Moor Lodge kitchen garden, and was extended with the addition of the Richardson Wing (providing beds for children) in 1911. The name of the hospital was later changed to St Mary Magdalene Home in 1931 (the same year that the original Moor Lodge was finally demolished, having previously reverted to use as a private dwelling), and it was renamed Hunters Moor Hospital upon becoming part of the National Health Service in 1948. Hunters Moor Hospital was home for the Regional Neurological Rehabilitation Centre until 2007 when the Centre moved to new purpose built accommodation at Walkergate Hospital. The site of Hunters Moor Hospital has been acquired by Dame Allan's Schools for development as a purpose built primary school. Spital Tongues village Originally some way from the centre of Newcastle, Spital Tongues was considered to be a beautiful place, surrounded by the large open spaces of the Town Moor and Castle Leazes. Over the last fifty years, new development has nibbled away at these green spaces, much of it related to the expansion of Newcastle University and the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) to the south and east. Nevertheless, for a place located less than from the present-day city centre, Spital Tongues retains a remarkable sense of separation and distinctiveness. Together, Hunters Moor, Nuns Moor, the Town Moor and Castle Leazes provide an effective buffer on three sides between Spital Tongues and the surrounding area, helping to maintain the area's village feel. Indeed, many older residents continue to refer to Spital Tongues as \\"the village\\", a sense of identity both reflected in and perpetuated by names such as the 'Village Chippy'. Another feature adding to Spital Tongue's erstwhile attractiveness was the existence of its own water supply. The Pandon Burn came out of the ground at a spring in what is now Fountain Row, before running its course to the Tyne. This route crossed the road at what is now Barras Bridge, near St. Thomas' Church in the city centre. The bridge arch is still extant beneath the modern road, while the river is now culverted for the entire length of its journey between Spital Tongues and the Tyne. Spital Tongues' rural feel was further enhanced by the presence of an orchard on the site now occupied by Burnside and Wallace Street, and by the grazing of cattle on the Town Moor ‚Äì a practice that continues to this day. A key shift in the life and character of Spital Tongues took place with the opening of Spital Tongues Colliery in 1836. Basic housing for pit workers housing was constructed in Long Row, behind Morpeth Street, and demolished a century later. The area's industrial importance was further developed with the opening of Robson's furniture factory in the 1880s. This precipitated the construction of further housing, including Chippendale Place and Sheraton Street. The terraces of Ancrum Street and Oxnam Terrace were reputedly named after the border towns from which Robson's employees originated. Buildings and structures of note Fenham Barracks Alongside its industrial development, Spital Tongues also established some importance as a military settlement following the construction of Fenham Barracks in 1806. The barracks were home to the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers until 1962, though the Queen's Own Yeomanry (Territorial Army) retains a presence on the site. Other barrack buildings now form part of Leazes Parade, a development of flats for Newcastle University students. BBC Broadcasting Centre One of the most recent additions to Spital Tongues, occupying the prominent site on the corner of Hunters Road and Barrack Road, is the BBC Broadcasting Centre, affectionately known as the 'Pink Palace'.Bus team win top award October 2003 www.bbc.co.uk, accessed 10 December 2019 Opened in 1986, it brought together the BBC's TV and radio operations in the North East from a range of city centre locations, notably the former Lying-In Hospital building in New Bridge Street that now forms part of the Newcastle Building Society headquarters. Huntsmoor House Huntsmoor House, Hunters Road, was built as a soldiers' home in 1899 to meet the social needs of those soldiers stationed at Fenham Barracks.Tyne and Wear HER(7882): Spital Tongues, Hunter's Road, Huntsmoor House - Details www.twsitelines.info, accessed 10 December 2019 During the fifties large steam presses were installed for finishing tailored garments. Many of the operators of the presses were adults with learning difficulties. They congregated in the centre of Newcastle each morning and were then walked to Huntsmoor House to begin their work. Occasionally, one of the workers would lean out of a window to call over children playing in the backlane between Hunter's Road and Ancrum Street to send them on an errand for sweets to Jenny Proctors sweet shop. A small twist of Victory V lozenges was a favourite purchase and the child running the errand would be rewarded with half a lozenge on their return. Later, Huntsmoor House was used as a warehouse by the Newcastle bookseller Thornes before being turned into student accommodation. A three-storey red brick structure, the design of Huntsmoor House is unusual, topped with a crenellated tower featuring carved shields and a flagpole. The central section is flanked by two arched windows that rise through two storeys, with a Tudor style exposed beam gable above. Chimney Mill Chimney Mill, Newcastle upon Tyne The Chimney Mill was constructed in 1782 in Claremont Road, replacing a previous windmill on the site. Grade II listed, it is significant on a number of levels ‚Äì as the only surviving smock mill in the region; as the first 5-sailed smock mill in Britain; and for being designed by the civil engineer John Smeaton, the man responsible for the third Eddystone Lighthouse (later dismantled and rebuilt as Smeaton's Tower on Plymouth Hoe). The Chimney Mill was powered by wind until 1891, decommissioned in 1892 and later converted into the clubhouse for Newcastle City Golf Club. The Club transferred to Gosforth in 1907, after which the windmill's sails and fantail were removed (in 1924 and 1933 respectively), with the windshaft and cap being dismantled and replaced by modern boarding in 1951.SINE Project (2004), Structure Details for Chimney Mill. In the mid-1970s the property was bought and restored by the architect Thomas Falconer. His conversion created a design studio on the top floor, an architect's studio on the first floor and space for rent on the ground floor. The building has been used as offices for the fashion design company Nigel Cabourn Ltd since 1983. In September 2006, the property was being marketed for sale at a price of ¬£775,000. Victoria Tunnel The Victoria Tunnel was built to transport coal from Spital Tongues Colliery, opened in 1836, to the river Tyne. long and up to deep, the tunnel was built by 200 men between 1839 and 1842, and came about as a result of the owners, Latimer and Porter, being refused permission to build a surface wagonway across the moor and city. Its Spital Tongues entrance was close to what is now the junction of Belle Grove West and Ancrum Street. The tunnel ceased to be used in 1860, and remained unused for the next eighty years, except for a brief period from 1928 to 1929 when Thomas Moore, a Gateshead entrepreneur, attempted to farm mushrooms in the tunnel. It was reopened for use as an air raid shelter during World War II, with ¬£37,000 spent on alterations and new entrances in order to provide seating capacity for 9,000 people. Though no longer used, some of these entrances remain very visible today, notably the entrance in Claremont Road next to the Hancock Museum. The northernmost (Spital Tongues) entrance was filled in when Belle Grove West was built in the 1870s and is therefore not accessible. At the end of the war, most of the fittings were removed and all of the entrances except Ouse Street were closed. This entrance had been built on private land: the garden of number 14 Ouse Street. Luckily, it was left open and it is now possible to step into the Victoria Tunnel and explore Newcastle's hidden heritage. Guided tours are available most days each week throughout the year and these can be booked via www.ouseburntrust.org.uk. Whiteknights The house now called Whiteknights was originally known as New House prior to being opened as a lunatic asylum in 1766. At this time the property was renamed St. Luke's, before changing its name to Belle Grove Retreat in 1795. The property went on to give its name to the various other streets and buildings built in Spital Tongues from the 1850s, such as Belle Grove Terrace, Belle Grove Villas, Belle Grove West and the Belle Grove public house. The Belle Grove Retreat reverted to use as a private house in 1857, and assumed its current name in 1900. It is Grade II listed. Belle Grove public house On the corner of Belle Grove Terrace and Ancrum Street, the Belle Grove was a public house dating from 1857 until its closure in 2008. The adjacent house at No. 19, now part of the pub, was once the home of the artist Ralph Hedley until his death in 1913, a connection marked by a commemorative plaque.Newcastle City Council (2005), Local List of Buildings, Structures, Parks and Gardens of Special Local Architectural or Historic Interest in the City of Newcastle upon Tyne: Draft Local List - Wingrove Ward. It was incorporated into the pub in 1923.Tyne and Wear HER(9948): Spital Tongues, Belle Grove Terrace, Belle Grove Public House - Details www.twsitelines.info, accessed 10 December 2019 Belle Grove Terrace No. 13 Belle Grove Terrace was also once home to T. Dan Smith, the leader of Newcastle City Council from 1960 to 1965, and the man behind the intended reinvention of Newcastle as the 'Brasilia of the North'. The 15-storey Mill House tower block in Spital Tongues is one of many such residential towers erected across Newcastle during Smith's leadership; he lived there in an upper-storey flat from the early 1980s until his death in 1993. Actor Alun Armstrong was Smith's neighbour whilst studying Fine Art at Newcastle University. George Arrowsmith's Though of little architectural significance, the shop on the corner of Belle Grove West and Hunter's Road has historical interest as the site of George Arrowsmith's general store. Opened in 1903, the shop was owned by the Arrowsmiths ‚Äì one of Spital Tongues' most well-known families - until 1940. George and his wife Margaret had fifteen children following their marriage in 1882, and members of the Arrowsmith family continue to live in Spital Tongues today. The former Arrowsmith shop has remained in continual retail use, and is now one of only a handful of shops in the village. It represents a sharp decline from the Co-operative store and 27 other retailers that Spital Tongues boasted in the 1920s. Benson Memorial Church The Benson Memorial Church in Ancrum Street was opened as a Sunday school in 1867, recognising the role of John Benson in setting up the school in temporary premises in 1845. Today, the building continues to serve a community function as the home of the Apostolic Church.Tyne and Wear HER(7879): Spital Tongues, Ancrum Street, Benson Memorial Church - Details www.twsitelines.info, accessed 10 December 2019 Moorbank Botanic Garden Moorbank Botanic Gardens is located on Hunters Moor, at the top of Claremont Road. The Gardens were opened in 1923 as a plant research station for Newcastle University. Although not open to the public every day, access is granted to booked groups and on Open Days linked to the National Gardens Scheme. In 2012, Newcastle University announced its intention to withdraw its support for the facility Spital Tongues today Just as Spital Tongues has long sought to balance its competing rural and urban faces, the village today remains protected by its green collar at the same time as facing immense development pressure within the existing built up area. The continued expansion of Newcastle University remains a challenge, with more than 2,000 students already living in University-owned accommodation in Spital Tongues ‚Äì Castle Leazes Halls off Belle Grove West and Richardson Road flats between the Dental Hospital and Wallace Street. Plans for a series of new blocks of up to ten storeys at Castle Leazes Halls were rejected by the Planning Inspectorate in 2006, following significant local opposition and an earlier refusal by Newcastle City Council.Young, P. (2006), 'Battle against student tower blocks is won', Evening Chronicle, 11 May. icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/eveningchronicle Evening Chronicle (Newcastle, England) Battle against Student Tower Blocks Is Won www.questia.com, accessed 10 December 2019 Yet, while many local residents believe that Spital Tongues' student population has reached saturation point, there is no doubt that the student presence helps to support local shops, pubs and services that may not otherwise be viable. On the other hand, the diminishing number of permanent residents has undoubtedly contributed to the closure of other local services such as the school (in 1977) and post office (in 2005), meaning that residents must make the journey into the city centre or to neighbouring areas of Fenham and Arthur's Hill. However, the insatiable demand for housing in Spital Tongues is testament to its continued popularity as a place to live, combining relative proximity to the city centre with a unique, semi-rural atmosphere.

A part of Centro I was renamed Battaglione Azad Hindoustan in August 1942 when the Raggruppamento Centri Militari itself was redesignated as Raggruppamento Frecce Rosse (\\"Red Arrows group\\").Lundari. I Paracadutisti Italiani 1937-45. p. 99 By the time of its disbandment in November 1942, Battaglione Azad Hindoustan came to be between three hundred and fifty and four hundred strong. Units of the Raggruppamento Frecce Rosse were intended to infiltrate on the ground, from submarines and by parachute. Accordingly, a further unit was raised within the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan to form the plotone paracadutisti (\\"parachute platoon\\"). The chosen troops were sent for paratroop combat training to the parachute school at Tarquinia. Uniform The soldiers of the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan wore standard Italian military uniforms. However - unlike the troops of the German-raised Legion Freies Indien, who had peaked field caps - all the troops of the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan wore a turban of the colour of the Italian Sahariana tunic. Additionally, the troops wore on their tunics collar patches with three vertical stripes in the saffron, white and green (reflecting the colours of the Indian National Congress that was at the time the focus of the nationalist movement). Italians serving in the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan were distinguished by stars on the collar patches that was not worn by the Indian troops. The Tarquinia detachment sent for parachute training wore their own collar patches above paratroop-pattern patches, as well as the paratroop badge depicting an open yellow parachute embroidered in rayon thread on the left upper arm. Structure According to the order of battle of the Italian Raggruppamento Centri Militari in May 1942, the unit had the following under its control: comando (\\"headquarters\\") commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Massimo Invrea; Centro T consisting of Italians from Tunisia; Centro A consisting of Italians from Egypt, Palestine, Syria and Arabia; plus Arabs and Sudanese ex-prisoners-of-war and lastly; Centro I consisting of Italians from India and Persia and Indian ex-prisoners-of-war. In all, the Raggruppamento Centri Militari collected together approximately 1,200 Italians, 400 Indians and 200 Arabs. In August 1942 the Raggruppamento was renamed Raggruppamento Frecce Rosse (\\"Red Arrows group\\") a name chosen by the commanding officer in memory of his service with the Italian Divisione Frecce Nere (\\"Black Arrows Division\\") of the Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (\\"Corps of Volunteer Troops\\") in the Spanish Civil War. The three Centri Militari received new designations at the same time. According to the order of battle of the Italian Raggruppamento Frecce Rosse in August 1942, the following units comprised the force structure: comando (\\"headquarters\\"), Battaglione d'Assalto Tunisia (\\"Tunisia Assault Battalion\\"), which was formerly Centro T; Gruppo Italo-Arabo (\\"Italo-Arab Group\\"), formerly Centro A; and Battaglione Azad Hindoustan (\\"Free Indian Battalion\\"), formerly Centro I. The Battaglione Azad Hindoustan was created out of Centro I using both the ex- Indian Army personnel (the Indian Army was under British operational command) and Italians previously resident in India and Persia (Iran). The order of battle of the Battaglione Azad Hindoustan in August 1942 was: *Compagnia fucilieri (\\"motorized rifle company\\") *Compagnia mitraglieri (\\"motorized machine gun company\\") *Plotone paracadutisti (\\"parachute platoon\\") *Overseas Italian platoon Disbandment Despite their investment in training the Indians in infiltration combat, the Italians considered the Indian troops of Battaglione Azad Hindoustan to be of doubtful loyalty and this view was confirmed when the Indians mutinied on learning of the Axis defeat at El Alamein in November 1942. Following this the battalion was disbanded and the Indians returned to their prisoner-of-war camps.

Comics In the Marvel Universe, Team X was a CIA black ops team that operated during the 1960s and was linked to Weapon Plus. It was made up of Logan (James Howlett) (the future Wolverine), Victor Creed (the future Sabretooth), Mastodon, David North/Christoph Nord (Maverick), the Major Arthur Barrington, Silver Fox, Noel Higgins (Wildcat), Aldo Ferro (Vole) and John Wraith (Kestrel). In other media Television Team X featured in the X-Men of the mid-1990s in an episode called \\"Weapon X, Lies & Video Tape\\". In this episode, Wolverine, as do all the original members, had several flashbacks and returned to a Weapon X facility in Canada. The other team members are Sabretooth, Silver Fox, and Maverick. They recalled their previous missions and their battles with Omega Red, but also they realized that much of these memories were implanted into them by the Weapon X scientists. They were brought there to die at the hands of a Weapon X robot called Thalos. Thalos fails, but only because the team works together again to destroy the Weapon X countermeasure. Team X has also figured prominently in the storyline of the Wolverine and the X-Men animated series that began in 2008. In this series, the team consisted of Wolverine, Sabretooth, Mystique and operated as a section of the Weapon X project under the supervision of Dr. Cornelius. Following the departures of both Wolverine and Mystique, Maverick was captured, brainwashed and made to join the team. Film In the Wolverine segment of Hulk Vs, Team X is a team that works for the Weapon X organization which consists of Sabretooth, Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, and Omega Red. They were sent to capture the Hulk and ended up capturing Wolverine as well. In X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the team is led by Major William Stryker, and consists of James Howlett, Victor Creed, Wade Wilson, Frederick Dukes, John Wraith, Chris Bradley, and Agent Zero. During one mission, while trying to find a mineral used to create adamantium, Stryker orders the team to massacre an entire village. Howlett/Wolverine stops it, and leaves the group. After his departure, other team-members begin to question the team's morality and begin to leave until only Victor/Sabretooth and Agent Zero remain faithful to Stryker. During the events of the film, multiple members of the team are killed off by Logan or Victor. Bradley is easily killed by Creed early in the film, Agent Zero was killed by Wolverine, Wraith was killed by Sabretooth after he helped Wolverine find Stryker, and it is implied that Wade/Deadpool (Weapon XI) is killed (although the after-credit scene shows a still living decapitated Deadpool). In X2, Stryker is killed. By the end of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Wolverine and Victor are confirmed to be alive, while it is implied Deadpool may still be alive as well. The fate of Dukes is left unconfirmed, but it is implied that he was killed by Victor. In a deleted scene, Victor had subdued him and interrogated him.

Write combining cannot be used for general memory access (data or code regions) due to the weak ordering. Write-combining does not guarantee that the combination of writes and reads is done in the expected order. For example, a Write/Read/Write combination to a specific address would lead to the write combining order of Read/Write/Write which can lead to obtaining wrong values with the first read (which potentially relies on the write before). In order to avoid the problem of read/write order described above, the write buffer can be treated as a fully associative cache and added into the memory hierarchy of the device in which it is implemented. Adding complexity slows down the memory hierarchy so this technique is often only used for memory which does not need strong ordering (always correct) like the frame buffers of video cards.

Birth and family Newman was born in New York City to John and Mary Newman. His father was of German descent, his mother of French. John was converted to the Christian faith at the age of sixteen and became a member of the M.E. Church. He married Miss Angeline Ensign, the daughter of the Rev. Datus Ensign, who was one of the early Methodist ministers in Northern New York. Education John entered the Seminary at Cazenovia, New York, where he pursued college preparatory and theological studies, intending to enter Wesleyan University. But acting on the advice of friends, he did not proceed to college, but instead entered the Methodist ministry. Ordained ministry John entered upon pastoral work in 1848 as a member of the Oneida Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. During his first year his salary was only one hundred dollars. At the end of the year, after paying all of his expenses, he had five dollars remaining. Each succeeding year, with a single exception, he saved some part of his salary, however small it might be. He also pastored at Hamilton, New York. In 1855 he was transferred to the Troy Annual Conference. In 1857-58 Rev. Newman was stationed in Albany, New York, where his preaching first attracted attention outside his own denomination. In 1858 he was transferred to the New York Annual Conference and stationed in New York City. Travels and missions In the spring of 1860 he sailed for Europe. After an extensive tour on the Continent he visited the East, and for a year made a thorough study of Bible lands: Egypt, Arabia, and Palestine. As a result of his research he wrote a book on the Holy Land, entitled \\"From Dan to Beersheba.\\" Upon his return from his travels, Rev. Newman was again stationed in New York City, remaining for two years. In 1864 he was sent by Bishop Ames to establish the M.E. Church in Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. The M.E. Church (the northern branch) had ceased to exist in these states after the great ecclesiastical secession of 1844; the Methodists in that region instead organized as the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Rev. Newman began his mission in New Orleans, where he soon built a church worth fifty thousand dollars. He founded a seminary and an orphan asylum, as well, each with ample buildings and endowments. Indeed, out of the mission Rev. Newman then organized grew four Annual Conferences of the M.E. Church. In 1870, Newman traveled to Salt Lake City via the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad for a highly publicized debate with Latter-day Saint church leaders over the controversial subject of polygamy. For three days Newman and LDS Apostle Orson Pratt debated the question, \\"Does the Bible sanction polygamy?\\" Transcripts of the debate were carried by major newspapers throughout the country. On the third and final day of the debate, more than 11,000 people reportedly crammed into the city's famed tabernacle to hear Newman's and Pratt's remarks. Washington, D.C. In 1869 Rev. Newman was appointed to Washington as Pastor of the Metropolitan M.E. Church, which he helped organize. He retired from this pulpit in the Spring of 1872. However, it was a general wish that he should return to it as soon as it was admissible, and he accordingly resumed his pastorate in the Spring of 1875. In the meantime, Dr. Newman was Chaplain of the United States Senate, twice by unanimous vote, first assuming this position 8 March 1869, serving until 1874. One biographer wrote this of Rev. Newman: :\\"In pastoral work Dr. Newman is as useful and successful as in the pulpit. Since his return he has felt the necessity of, and has sought, a more complete consecration to Christ, and a fuller anointing of the Holy Ghost, and on this he relies for the success of his ministry.\\"First Fifty Years of Cazenovia Seminary Government service In the Spring of 1873 Dr. Newman was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as Inspector of United States Consulates in Asia, serving 1874-76. In discharge of the duties of this position, Dr. Newman crossed the Pacific Ocean, traveling extensively in China, Japan, and other oriental countries with which the U.S.A. had diplomatic relations. He prosecuted his investigations with great industry and conscientious faithfulness. His habits of observation and ability to describe what he saw pre-eminently fitted him for the duties he was required to perform. Dr. Newman's report to the United States Department of State covered more than two hundred pages, containing observations and suggestions of great value to the Government. His expenses amounted to only two thousand, three hundred dollars, covering his service for one and one-half years. During various investigations, which were rife in 1876, Dr. Newman was summoned before a Congressional Committee, in answer to whose interrogations he gave much important information relating to the U.S. Diplomatic Service. Indeed, the Committee was surprised at the value of services, which had instead been represented in some of the newspapers as a mere \\"pleasure tour.\\" Upon his return, Dr. Newman used his extensive notes in the preparation of a work entitled, \\"Thrones and Palaces of Babylon and Nineveh.\\" Pastoral ministry resumed Upon his return from overseas Government work, Rev. Newman returned to the pulpit of the Metropolitan Church, Washington, where he served an additional three years. He was then transferred to the Central Methodist Church in New York City, where he also served three years. In the winter of 1882 he accepted a unanimous invitation to become Pastor of the Madison Avenue Congregational Church in New York, serving two years. Upon his resignation from the Madison Ave. church, Rev. Newman visited California. He was then called upon to minister to President Ulysses S. Grant in his final illness. Dr. Newman then was appointed a third time to the Metropolitan Church in Washington, serving a final two years. Service to the M.E. Church Dr. Newman was thrice elected a delegate to the General Conference of his denomination. In 1876 he served as a commissioner to help adjust the relations of the M.E. and M.E., South Churches. In 1881 he was sent to England as a delegate to the Methodist ecumenical council. In 1885 he delivered a discourse at the funeral of President Grant. In 1887 he delivered another discourse at the funeral of General John A. Logan. Indeed, Dr. Newman was known as one of the most eloquent pulpit orators of his Church, and was known throughout the Nation as a popular lecturer. Episcopal ministry Bishop Newman was elected to the episcopacy at the 1888 General Conference of the M.E. Church. He was a delegate to the first and second Ecumenical Conferences. Bishop Newman died 5 July 1899 in Saratoga Springs, New York and is buried in Mechanicville, New York. Honorary degrees Rev. Newman was honored in 1863 by the University of Rochester with the D.D. degree. He received the LL.D. degree from Grant Memorial University in 1881. Otterbein College also honored him with the LL.D. in 1881.

Juli√°n Carrillo wrote: \\"The thirteenth sound will be the beginning of the end and the point of departure of a new musical generation which will transform everything.\\"Carrillo, Juli√°n (1923). \\"El Sonido 13\\", Pl√°ticas musicales, Vol. II.

Aguirre, Sarabia, Silverman, and Vasconcelos; eds. De Gruyter. . History Early life Juli√°n Carrillo was a native of the state of San Luis Potos√≠ in Mexico. He attended the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, where he studied Violin, Composition, Physics, Acoustics, and Mathematics. The laws that define music intervals instantly amazed Carrillo, which led him to conduct experiments on his violin. He began analyzing the way the pitch of a string changed depending on the finger position, concluding that there had to be a way to split the string into an infinite number of parts. One day, Carrillo was able to divide the fourth string of his violin with a razor into 16 parts in the interval between the notes G and A, thus creating 16 unique sounds. This event was the beginning of Sonido 13 that led Carrillo to study more about physics and the nature of intervals. Professional life Carrillo became an excellent musician at the Conservatory and received a scholarship to study in Leipzig Royal Conservatory. After Carrillo returned to Mexico in 1918, he became conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra and in 1920 he also became principal of the National Conservatory of Music. It was during this time that he began to invest a significant amount of time on Sonido 13. His achievements in this area were extensive and consisted of writing over 20 books, making more than 40 compositions, patenting fifteen pianos capable of producing small intervals, and organizing the Sonido 13 Symphonic Orchestra that performed in different parts of the world, playing microtonal music composed by Carrillo in different intervals. In 1933, Ahualulco, the town where Juli√°n Carrillo was born, was renamed to Ahualulco del Sonido 13 in honor of Carrillo's work. Carrillo was, \\"closely associated with the D√≠az regime,\\" and preferred neo-classicism to nationalism.Bethell, Leslie, ed. (1998). A Cultural History of Latin America: Literature, Music and the Visual Arts in the 19th and 20th Centuries, p.95. . Music theory Introduction Juli√°n Carrillo was a pioneer of microtonal music in the Western world. Juli√°n Carrillo started dividing whole tones (major seconds) into 16 intervals, but he did not stop there. Through experiments, Carrillo noticed that he could divide the string into an infinite number of intervals, or into as many intervals as it is physically possible. Carrillo created intervals of 3 (), 4 (), 5 (), 16 (), 32 (), 64 (), and 128 () tones within a major second, leaving the formula to create more, if desired. However, as the number of intervals increases it becomes harder to distinguish the notes from each other (see just noticeable difference). Notation Because new sets of sounds were created, it was imperative to make a new notation system. Carrillo developed an easy method for notation, which would help people not familiar with previous forms of notation to quickly learn to read and write music. To show how easy the new writing system was, Carrillo gave two New York elementary school boys, who had no prior knowledge of Sonido 13, a simple work by Bach to convert to his notation system. The boys accomplished the task in less than an hour, proving that the new writing method was easy to learn. The new writing system is not as graphic as the conventional staff or stave, and instead of calling the notes by a letter or a syllable (Do, Re, Mi, etc.) they are represented by a number. The numbering system starts with a zero and increments by one until the last note of the octave is reached. Within this system, the number of notes in an octave is dependent on the number of intervals that one wishes to create within a whole tone. From Carrillo's \\"Teor√≠a L√≥gica de la M√∫sica\\" (Logical Theory of the Music) Converting current notes (above) to the new notation system (below). There are no smaller intervals in this case. Carrillo used many intervals, although mainly in multiples of 4 such as 16, 32, and 64 so that between each of the whole tones, 16, 32, or 64 additional notes were created. Carrillo called these intervals 16hs of a tone, 32nds of a tone, and 64ths of a tone, respectively. As a result, C would be labeled 0, D flat would be labeled 8, D would be labeled 16, E flat would be labeled 24, E would be labeled 32, etc., for 16ths of a tone. From Carrillo's \\"Teor√≠a L√≥gica de la M√∫sica\\" (Logical Theory of the Music). Converting current notation (above) to sixteenths of a tone to the new notation system (below). 96-tet When notating music, Carrillo used a staff. However, instead of using lines to signify different notes, he used the lines to distinguish between octaves so that each line on the staff represents a different octave. For example, if 0 on the second line of the staff denoted what conventional music terms middle C, 0 on the third line would refer to C an octave higher, and 0 on the first line would refer to C an octave lower. Musical instruments This system added sounds unexplored by generations of musicians, so new adaptations of current instruments had to be made to support the small intervals, and for this reason the instruments were reduced in the number of octaves they contained. For example, a standard piano has 88 keys that cover more than 7 octaves, and a piano with 88 keys made for 16ths of a tone would not constitute a full octave. To have the same number of octaves as a conventional piano, a piano for 16ths of a tone would need 704 keys. So, using logic and innovative thoughts of modern luthiers, a traditional piano will be enriched infinitely. Every existing instrument has to be modified to adapt to the new rules of the Sonido 13 system, but also new instruments have to be designed and created. Thus, modern luthiers have an almost fantastic but still unexplored world in front of them, except by Carrillo's mind. Latest news New efforts are being done to resurrect the 13th Sound music and theory. In 2005 Mexican cellist Jimena Gimenez recently recorded the entire Carrillo's Cello Sonatas and Mexican-Quebecer guitarist Ang√©los Quetzalc√≥atl (The \\"Ambassador\\" of the 13th Sound) recorded almost all the guitar repertoire. Besides these recording efforts, new music is being created using the Sonido 13 teachings and the Official Juli√°n Carrillo Website was created by 13th sound musician Hugo Vargas. The website soon became extremely popular among Sonido 13 researchers and it gained the \\"Official\\" Status in 2009 thanks to the decision of Angel and Miguel Carrillo, executors of the Juli√°n Carrillo Estate. The \\"Ambassador of the 13th Sound\\" travels around the world promoting the 13th Sound principles which are: #to purify music; #to enrich music; #to facilitate music. He has achieved international recognition by government institutions, the executors of the Carrillo Estate and his peers due to his formidable commitment for totally resurrecting the Revolution of the 13th Sound.

In order to help finance his chosen career of professional writer, he occasionally worked as an editor for journals such as Dazhboh and Karby. Antonych died from pneumonia on 6 July 1937. In October 2009, the National Bank of Ukraine issued a commemorative coin in his honor as a part of their \\"Outstanding Personalities of Ukraine\\" series.

Known as one of the best-known Chinese poets of the Song Dynasty, he served as a government official, and was an academic authority in geography, especially the southern provinces of China. His written work also falls under the literary category of 'travel record literature' (y√≥uj√¨ w√©nxu√©), a narrative and prose style approach to writing about one's travel experiences, which was popular in China during the Song Dynasty.Hargett, 67-68. He, along with Yang Wanli, Lu You, and You Mao, are considered to be the \\"four masters\\" of Southern Song dynasty poetry. F√†n was also a member of a cadet branch of the elite F√†n family. Life and works F√†n's work deals with the traditional themes of the period, including peasant life, Prunus mume, the seasons, Buddhism, and growing old. F√†n was born in Suzhou into a middle- ranking family at a time of conflict between the Southern Song and Jin dynasties. A precocious child, his early studies of classical literature prepared him for a career in the civil service - a career that was temporarily interrupted when his parents died within a few months of each other in 1143, leaving F√†n solely in charge of the family estate. These studies, together with his experiences of working in the fields as a teenager and his interest in Buddhism, provided inspiration for his later poetry. After a youth of austere poverty, F√†n Ch√©ngd√† was able to pass the Imperial Examination and secure the jinshi degree in 1154 AD. Afterwards, he entered a long career in service of the state. During his career he wrote an important geographical treatise known as the Gu√¨ H«éi Y√∫ H√©ng Zh√¨. The book focused primarily on the topography of the land and commercial products of China's southern provinces.Needham, Volume 3, 510. In this F√†n followed a long geographical literary tradition, continuing from the Shu Jing (Historical Classic) of the 5th century BC, the Huainan Zi of the 2nd century BC, and predating the famous written works by the Ming Dynasty geographer Xu Xiake. However, his best-known work is a series of sixty poems which he wrote in 1186, following his retirement from his position as a high official at the Southern Song Court. The poems have been translated into English under the name Stone Lake - the location of his retirement villa just outside Suzhou.  Treatise on mei- flowers  One of F√†n's greatest interests was writing about flora and fauna, and he contributed the first writing regarding horticulture in China written specifically about the meihua flower, also known as plum blossoms. He associated the mei-flower with the \\"gentleman-recluse,\\" a gentleman who still lived a simple farming life. He also believed the meihua was a flower that represented purity as it grew in the wild and was not originally a flower cultivated by people. He associated this purity with himself and his own dreams of escaping the \\"worldly-dust,\\" a reference to his deep Buddhist beliefs. In addition to his interest in mei-flowers, F√†n also wrote the Treatise on Chrysanthemums.  Summit to Mount Emei  On June 27, 1177 F√†n departed from the city of Chengdu, Sichuan and traveled 100 miles south to Jia county (modern-day Leshan). His focus on this visit was to travel to Mount Emei, a mountain famous for its notoriety in regards to Buddhism. He followed the Min River to Jia county and spent ten days there touring scenic Buddhist sites, first the Colossal Buddha and then Mount Emei. He wrote various diary entries documenting his journey up the mountain. In a diary entry dated 16‚Äì20 July 1177, F√†n wrote: > \\"Moored in Jia county. Most of the people seeing me off have now returned > home. Leaving my family on the boated moored below the banks of Jia county, > I rode alone towards Emei... It is recorded in Buddhist texts that this is > the place where the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra makes his appearance and > manifestation.\\" 22 July, he wrote: > \\"Set out from Emei town.

Sagara had 60,000 sons from wife Sumati and one son from Keshini. Story According to Valmiki's account in Ramayana, he was a wild and wicked young man. He used to throw young boys playing in Sarayu river into great depths and see them drown. Thus his father Sagara exiled him. But his son Amshuman from his wife Ambujakshi succeeded Sagara as the king of Ayodhya. According to Srimad Bhagavatam Chapter 8 of canto 9, in his previous birth, Asamanja had been a great mystic yogi, but by bad association he had fallen from his exalted position. Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a jatismara; that is, he had the special advantage of being able to remember his past birth and wanted to lead a stay isolated without interacting with the people. Therefore, he wanted to display himself as a miscreant, so that people would hate him and he would do things that were abominable in the eyes of the public and unfavorable to his relatives. He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayu by throwing them into the depths of the water. Because Asamanja engaged in such abominable activities, his father gave up affection for him and had him exiled. Then Asamanja exhibited his mystic power by reviving the boys and showing them to the King and their parents. After this, Asamanja left Ayodhya. All the inhabitants of Ayodhya saw that their boys had come back to life, they were astounded, and King Sagara greatly lamented the absence of his son.

The composer's friend Anselm H√ºttenbrenner recalled - twenty-six years after Schubert's death - a conversation in which Schubert had said \\"I loved someone very dearly and she loved me too ‚Ä¶ . For three years she hoped I would marry her; but I could not find a position which would have provided for us both.\\" Therese Grob was the daughter of Heinrich Grob and Theresia M√§nner (died 22 August 1826). She was born in Lichtental, Vienna, Archduchy of Austria. There was one other child, a boy called Heinrich (1800‚Äì1855) who was two years younger than Therese. The father died on 6 April 1804.A-Wsa, Totenbeschauprotokoll 1804 The widowed mother continued to run the small silk-weaving business that Heinrich Senior had established. The premises were very near to Schubert's home. Therese had an attractive soprano voice, and the young Heinrich was a talented pianist and violinist. The two families grew close through music-making. Therese sang in the Lichtental parish church, which Schubert had been attending since he was a child. For the church's centenary celebrations, the young Schubert completed his first mass in late July 1814 - the Mass in F, D.105 - and Therese sang the soprano solo at the premiere performance, which Schubert conducted himself. Schubert assembled an album of songs for Therese's brother Heinrich, the last of which is dated 1816. A Marriage Consent Law enforced by Metternich expressly forbade marriages by men in Schubert's class if they could not verify their ability to support a family. Schubert's application in April 1816, eventually rejected, for the post of music teacher at a teachers' training college in Laibach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia) may have been in part driven by his awareness to gain some financial security to make marriage to Therese possible. On 21 November 1820 Therese married Johann Bergmann (24 June 1797 ‚Äì 1875), a baker. Together they had four children: Theresia (1821‚Äì1894), Johann Baptist (1822‚Äì1875), Amalia (9 July 1824 ‚Äì 24 December 1886) and Carolina (b. 1828). Schubert himself never married. Eight years after the composer's death, on 14 September 1836, Schubert's brother Ignaz married Therese's aunt Wilhelmine.

It is in the Vamos municipal unit in the Apokoronas municipality. The community consists of the villages Kefalas, Drapanos and Palailoni. Overview Kefalas owes its name to the first residents there, called the Kephalades, the leaders of the Byzantine settlers sent to Crete in 1182. It is about five minutes by car from the village of Vamos itself and about 10 minutes to Almyrida beach on the northwest coast of the island. The village is on the northeast edge of the Drapanos peninsula, built facing the sea. Eight churches can be found here. (Local residents talk of up to 25 churches in total, many of which are hidden in private gardens.) There are views from Kefalas to the Bay of Georgioupolis and the Cretan White Mountains. On the approach to Kefalas from Vamos there is a stone structure with welcome notes in Greek and English. This is the tiny church of The Saint of Miracles, and was built by Vangelis, the museum curator. It is open to the public. In Kefalas Square there is an old school (renovated and reopened as a School of Environmental Studies). Immediately on the left of the school is an old house, which has been renovated and turned into a museum. It contains artefacts, donated by the villagers, to represent a typical village house from the previous century. An outhouse, across the yard to the rear, holds farming implements and various tools. The museum is open most summer evenings until 10 pm. Entrance is free but small donations are welcomed and help to pay for its upkeep. Also in the square are a taverna, a large church and a statue bearing the names of local people who died during the war. The village Palailoni is 1 km north of Kefalas. Many old, traditional buildings still remain on the main street which is lined with eucalyptus trees. On the Drapanos side of Palailoni, is a road at 35¬∞25'21.67\\"N 24¬∞14'21.68\\"E, which leads down to Ombrosgialos Bay (sometimes called \\"Octopus Bay\\"). There is no beach but a concrete ramp for boat trailers and the local people go swimming there. During summer a temporary snack bar is sometimes open. Between Palailoni and Drapanos is a track at 35¬∞25'33.09\\"N 24¬∞14'13.30\\"E, which leads to the ancient Venetian Wells. These stone-lined, water-filled holes measure several metres in diameter and hold goldfish (and mosquitos). The roads through Kefalas are narrow in places and, as it is impossible to drive a bus or large vehicle through, work has begun on a bypass road, which runs from Palailoni down the hill to Ksirosterni. At the southern end of Kefalas is a narrow turning at 35¬∞24'24.29\\"N 24¬∞14'59.39\\"E onto a tarmac road, which leads to a small church and graveyard, with views towards the Bay of Georgioupolis.

Kao was one of India's foremost intelligence officers, and helped build R&AW.; He held the position of Secretary (Research) in the Cabinet Secretariat of the Government of India, which has been held by all R&AW; directors since. He had also, during the course of his long career, served as the personal security chief to Prime Minister Nehru and as security adviser to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He also founded the Aviation Research Centre (ARC) and the Joint Intelligence Committee. An intensely private man, Kao was rarely seen in public post- retirement, and was photographed only twice throughout his life. Personal life Early years Kao was born in the city of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh on 10 May 1918 to a Kashmiri Pandit family who immigrated from Srinagar district. He was brought up by his uncle Pandit Trilokinath Kao. Encouraged to pursue education, he had his early schooling in the city of Baroda, in the Bombay Presidency. Here he did his matriculation in 1932 and intermediate in 1934. In 1936, he attained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Lucknow University. He then chose to pursue a master's degree in English Literature at Allahabad University. He completed his Master of Arts degree some time before 1940. Later years Rameshwarnath Kao was also known as Ramji amongst his friends and colleagues. A fiercely private man, he was rarely seen in public. He knew too much to make a public statement or write a book. Some attribute this to a life devoted to adventure and espionage which made it very difficult for him to mingle publicly. He was a recluse leading a heavily guarded life in his New Delhi bungalow, very rarely giving interviews. From 1989, Kao dedicated his time largely to the task of restoring the dignity and honour of the Kashmiri Pandits. He interacted with various political leaders and the Indian government to see that the Kashmir problem was not forgotten. He died in 2002 at age 84. He left behind his wife, Malini Kao, to whom he had been married for 60 years, and daughter Achala Kaul. Personal traits Kao was well liked in the international intelligence community. His professionalism was well regarded by his colleagues and the Prime Ministers Nehru and Indira Gandhi. Handsome, incorruptible, suave and intellectual, Rameshwar was a shy and humble person. Count Alexandre de Marenches, erstwhile head of the French external intelligence agency, or SDECE (Service For External Documentation And Counter-Intelligence) as it was then known, named Kao as one of the 'five great intelligence chiefs of the 1970s'. About Kao, whom he knew well and admired, the Count remarked: Alexandre praised the way Kao had built up R&AW; into a professional intelligence organisation and made it play a key role to change the strategic face of the Indian Subcontinent within a span of three years of R&AWs; formation. Career Kao, for a while, took up a job in a cigarette company floated by Pt. Jag Mohan Narain Mushran, the then Chief Justice of the Benaras State. Early career Kao took classes in Law in Allahabad University but left when he joined the Indian Imperial Police in 1940 after passing Civil services examination. His first posting was in Kanpur as an Assistant Superintendent of Police. Kao was deputed to the Intelligence Bureau (I.B.), on the eve of Independence when it was being reorganised under B.N. Mullick. He was put in charge of VIP security, which included the task of looking after the security ring of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Later looking after 2nd PM Lal bahadur shastri, can be seen in pictures while shaking hands with army soldiers. Sometime in the late 50s he was sent to Ghana to help the then government of prime minister Kwame Nkrumah set up an intelligence and security organisation there. Kashmir Princess Probe Kashmir Princess was a Lockheed L-749A Constellation aircraft owned by Air India which exploded in midair and crashed into the Pacific Ocean on 11 April 1955 while en route from Bombay, India and Hong Kong to Jakarta, Indonesia, carrying delegates to the Bandung Conference. 16 of those on board were killed; three survived. Investigators believed that the explosion had been caused by a time bomb placed aboard the aircraft by a secret agent of the Kuomintang, also known as the Chinese Nationalist Party, who was attempting to assassinate Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, who had been scheduled to board the plane to attend the conference but had changed his travel plans at the last minute. Kao, along with British and Chinese agents, probed the circumstances leading to the crash. His work with the Chinese earned him a letter of recommendation from Zhou Enlai. Under the new Government In 1977, the Government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was toppled when the Congress was defeated in the elections by the Janata Party. Kao's closeness to Indira Gandhi had aroused deep suspicion among the political class about his role in the Emergency. However, Kao had privately advised Mrs. Gandhi not to declare emergency. His tenure had been extended by Mrs. Gandhi; he would have retired in 1976 otherwise. When Morarji Desai's government came to power after the Emergency, Kao was under no illusion about how the new set of politicians‚Äî who had publicly attacked Indira Gandhi for spying on them‚Äî would react to his presence. He resigned quietly and kept out of the public eye. A thorough inquiry cleared him and the R&AW; of all blame. He returned when Indira made a comeback in 1980. He worked as a security adviser to both Indira and Rajiv Gandhi. Most of the details of Kao's life will remain secret for the better part of the next century. However it is no secret that Kao made immeasurable contributions to the security of India. His invaluable service in various capacities in the Indian intelligence establishment led to great improvements in its functioning. Notwithstanding all criticisms regarding his political impact, it is through the untiring efforts of Kao that the foundations of modern intelligence handling in India were laid and a generation of intelligence professionals were trained. National Security Guard Kao created the National Security Guard (NSG), during the Punjab terrorism of the 1980s, to address the needs of the Government of India to counteract terrorism within the country. As R&AW; Chief Founding and establishing R&AW; After the intelligence failure of being unable to predict the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the Operation Gibraltar of 1965, the Indian polity felt the need to establish a separate organisation for gathering intelligence for military purposes. Kao was handpicked by Jawaharlal Nehru himself, who knew him well, from his years as Nehru's Head of Personal Security. On his return from Ghana, he was made the first director of the newly formed Aviation Research Centre at Charbatia, Odisha, that chiefly concentrated on TECHINT collection. The Sino- Indian War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 caused the restructuring of the country's intelligence apparatus, since real-time foreign intelligence had become a political necessity. The Intelligence Bureau of India (IB) was considered to have become something of a behemoth, and was bogged down by internal operations and politicisation. In 1968, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had then also begun tightening her grip on the Congress party, bifurcated the Intelligence Bureau to form the Research and Analysis Wing. The IB would be involved in domestic intelligence gathering, while the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;) was created as India's primary external intelligence agency. Its mandate was to monitor the world in general and South Asia in particular. Kao was chosen as the head of the new organization, with a rank of Secretary (Research) in the Cabinet Secretariat, a post that all R&AW; Chiefs occupy. As its founder-chief, Kao was given the task of building up R&AW; from scratch. He spent the next nine years as the head of the organisation. He took over R&AW; at a time when things were beginning to hot up in the subcontinent. His tenure, which began in 1968, lasted for nearly a decade and marked the closest association that an Indian prime minister has ever had with the country's intelligence chief. He had unlimited access to Indira Gandhi. She reposed complete faith in him. Bangladesh liberation war period Towards the end of the 1960s, when the problems in East Pakistan began to escalate, the meetings with Indira Gandhi became more and more frequent. Recalls long-time Kao associate Victor Longer: \\"Intelligence is the only government business that depends upon the spoken word. Sometimes you can understand signs and body language. Kao had that rapport with Mrs Gandhi.\\" The PMO's inner group of Kashmiri advisors D.P. Dhar, P.N. Haksar and T.N. Kaul now had another Kashmiri, Kao, for company. While what transpired at the meetings can now only be a matter of conjecture, Kao's own team, notably Shankaran Nair (former R&AW; Director) and Girish Chandra Saxena (former R&AW; Director and Jammu and Kashmir Governor), sized up the emerging scenario in what is now Bangladesh with precision. What was worked out was not just the larger picture but the little nuts and bolts‚Äîcontingency plans and micro details. The idea of India training and equipping the freedom fighters of Mukti Bahini was evolved meticulously. After Pakistan launched Operation Searchlight, R&AW; played a highly important role in the Creation of Bangladesh. They gave arms and training support to the Mukti Bahini during the initial stages of the war. Amidst the mass killings and brutal rapes, Indian operatives would get into East Pakistan, arm the local population and capitalise on the frustrations brewing within. Ashok Raina, in his book \\"Inside R&AW;\\", writes: \\"Another R&AW; assessment sent to the prime minister spelt out the need for surgical intervention for the reports that came in gave positive indications that Pakistan was preparing for war. R&AW; received the green signal. R&AW; established guerrilla training camps along the border and began to train an illegal army.\\" According to Gunaratna, the Bangladesh operation took place in two phases: covert subversion and military intervention. \\"Phase one was coordinated by Kao and phase two by Manekshaw, both reporting directly to Indira Gandhi,\\" he said. During the 1971 war, intelligence was thorough enough that the Indian Air Force could bomb the room in which the East Pakistan Cabinet was in session. Naval commandos were able to blow every single Pakistani ship in the Chittagong harbour. Kao maintained close connection with the new nation. In May 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent him to Dhaka to warn Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of his impending assassination by some in his Army. Merger of Sikkim Kao can also largely be credited for merging Sikkim into India in 1975 as its 22nd state. It was he who predicted and identified the fact that the merger must be effected before other competing interests like China moved in. Delhi had publicly acknowledged the good work done by R&AW; at that point. Some analysts say Kao also had a substantial role in arming Tamil guerrillas in the late seventies and eighties and played a pivotal role in Sri Lankan affairs, even though he was no longer the hands-on man. Legacy Kao is a legend among the Indian and South Asian Intelligence community, for his creation of the R&AW; as a formidable force in such a short time from its inception. He is also well regarded by his juniors. His influence was such that those who served under him during this time were affectionately called 'Kaoboys'. Although the R&AW; was established only in 1968, by the 1971 war, it had become a highly efficient and formidable force. Kao is credited to have, in only three years of R&AW;'s existence, helped in bringing about the creation of a new nation. Former chairman of Joint Intelligence Committee K.N. Daruwala has said: > \\"His contacts the world over, particularly in Asia‚ÄîAfghanistan, Iran, China, > you name it‚Äîwere something else. He could move things with just one phone > call. He was a team leader who rode out notorious inter-departmental and > inter-service rivalries, which is commonplace in India.\\" R.N. Kao Memorial Lecture In order to commemorate the legacy of its founder R&AW; created the annual R.N. Kao Memorial Lecture. The first lecture took place in 2006 on the fifth anniversary of Kao's death, and was delivered by writer-diplomat Shashi Tharoor. In 2007 Kumar Mangalam Birla delivered the second annual lecture, he focused on the shortage of people with the right skill set, in and out of the government. He counted the scramble for talent as one of the issues that looms the largest ‚Äî globally and in India ‚Äî over organisations in the private and public sector.  See also  * R.N.

This firing mode is commonly used in submachine guns and assault rifles. Other types of firearms, such as machine pistols, e.g., the Beretta 93R may also have a burst mode. The burst mode is normally employed as an intermediate fire mode between semi-automatic and fully automatic, although some firearms lack a \\"full auto\\" capability and use a burst mode instead. For instance, the M16A4 (the standard-issue service rifle of the USMC) has, in addition to the semi-automatic mode, a three-round burst mode, which replaced the fully automatic mode of the previous M16A1 and A3 models. The reason for this replacement was the massive waste of ammunition and very poor performance of soldiers who fired their rifles in fully automatic mode during the Vietnam War. The number of rounds fired in a burst is almost universally determined by a cam mechanism that trips the trigger mechanism for each shot in the burst. Some designs, as employed on the M16 series, will terminate the burst if the trigger is released before the burst is complete. Thus, the next time the trigger is pulled, the weapon will only fire one or two rounds. Other designs, such as the mechanism found on Heckler & Koch weapons, will reset the cam position. Thus, the next burst will still fire a full number of rounds. Some firearms, like the AN-94, AO-63 assault rifle and the G-11 have a feature in which rounds are fired in quick succession (2-round burst at 1800 rpm in the case of the AN-94). This increases the burst's accuracy, as multiple rounds are fired before the recoil impulse has affected the shooter's aim (before the impulse is even transferred to the shooter, in the case of the G-11). This is performed by having the barrel slide back and receive another round in the chamber pulled by a pulley and is fired as the barrel slams at the bolt, when the first chambered round is fired when the sliding barrel is at rest, as opposed to a cam mechanism of the M16 design.

Advantages The main advantage of burst mode over single mode is that the burst mode typically increases the throughput of data transfer. Any bus transaction is typically handled by an arbiter, which decides when it should change the granted master and slaves. In case of burst mode, it is usually more efficient if you allow a master to complete a known length transfer sequence. The total delay in a data transaction can be typically written as a sum of initial access latency plus sequential access latency. :\\\\ t_{total} = t_{initial} + t_{sequential} Here the sequential latency is same in both single mode and burst mode, but the total initial latency is decreased in burst mode, since the initial delay (usually depends on FSM for the protocol) is caused only once in burst mode. Hence the total latency of the burst transfer is reduced, and hence the data transfer throughput is increased. It can also be used by slaves that can optimise their responses if they know in advance how many data transfers there will be. The typical example here is a DRAM which has a high initial access latency, but sequential accesses after that can be performed with fewer wait states. Details The usual reason for having a burst mode capability, or using burst mode, is to increase data throughput. The steps left out while performing a burst mode transaction may include: * Waiting for input from another device * Waiting for an internal process to terminate before continuing the transfer of data * Transmitting information which would be required for a complete transaction, but which is inherent in the use of burst mode In the case of DMA, the DMA controller and the device are given exclusive access to the bus without interruption; the CPU is also freed from handling device interrupts. The actual manner in which burst modes work varies from one type of device to another; however, devices that have some sort of a standard burst mode include the following: * Random access memory (RAM), including EDO, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, and RDRAM; only the last three are required to send data in burst mode, according to industry standards * Computer busses such as Conventional PCI, Accelerated Graphics Port, and PCI express * Hard disk drive (HDD) interfaces such as SCSI and IDE  See also  * Asynchronous I/O * Command queue * Direct memory access (DMA) * SDRAM burst ordering References Category:Computer buses Category:Computer memory ","title":"Burst mode (computing)"},{"id":"7076607","text":"Xirosterni () is a village and a community located in the Apokoronas regionhttp://www.angelfire.com/super2/greece/xirosterni.html close to the northwest coast of the island of Crete, Greece, in Chania regional unit.http://www.greece.com/destinations/Crete/Chania/Village/Xirosterni.html The community consists of the settlements Xirosterni and Litsarda.

The dam was completed in 1955 as part of the Trevallyn Hydro Electric Scheme and now holds the waters of Lake Trevallyn. Specifications Lake Trevallyn is a concrete gravity dam built on Dolerite bedrock. The spillway height is 26.8 metres and the dam wall is 177 metres long. The lake has a surface area of 1.48 km¬≤ and storage capacity of 12.33 million m¬≥. ANCOLDDam Technology in Australia 1850-1999, ed. B. Cole, ANCOLD lists Trevallyn Dam as having a dam wall height of 33 metres and the total volume of the wall as 61,000 cubic metres. The dam diverts water to the Trevallyn Power Station through a 3.2 km tunnel. Lake Trevallyn Lake Trevallyn is the long, narrow lake created by the dam and extends as far as Hadspen where the first rapids begin at the junction of the Meander and South Esk Rivers. The widest point on the lake is at Stephenson's Bay where it reaches 390m wide. Launceston's outer suburb of Blackstone Heights and part of the Trevallyn State Recreation Area form part of the shore of Lake Trevallyn. Land around the lake is a mixture of suburbs, agricultural land and dry eucalypt forest. Facilities The lake and some of the surrounding land is used as a recreation area. Most facilities are located at Aquatic Point which include a boat launching ramp, jetty and ski-jump. A walking track connects Aquatic Point to the dam wall and Trevallyn State Recreation Area. The dam wall features a viewing platform, parkland and barbecue facilities. Most areas of the lake are open to boating and fishing with the exception of waters near the dam and penstock intake. Algal Blooms Lake Trevallyn is often prone to algal blooms in the warm summer months. The blooms are due to high nutrient levels from sewerage treatment and fertilizers, limited water movement and warm temperatures. The main species is Anabaena circinalis and though it has the potential to be toxic, no blooms recorded in the lake have proven to be toxic to date. Since 2007, a monitoring program has been in place to keep a check on algal levels and to notify authorities when blooms occur. Jellyfish In 2009, scientists discovered the freshwater jellyfish, Craspedacusta sowerbyi, in the waters of Lake Trevallyn close to Blackstone Heights. Believed to have been brought by migrating birds from China, the jellyfish were accidentally discovered during routine water testing. The jellyfish are non-venomous and translucent with average sizes around 2 cm across. Though introduced, the jellyfish are believed to have a beneficial impact on the area as they consume the larvae of mosquitoes. A few specimens were temporarily displayed at the QVMAG in Launceston after the discovery was made.

Hotel Excelsior occupied number 112/113, K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe (today's Stresemannstrasse) on Askanischer Platz in the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. It was once one of the largest and most luxurious hotels in Europe but its destruction during World War II resigned it to the German capital's list of lost historical landmarks.  Early years  Otto Rehnig - the architect responsible for the similarly fated Hotel Esplanade Berlin - was commissioned to design a hotel to accommodate the floods of passengers arriving in at the Anhalter Bahnhof across the street. When the Excelsior first opened on 2 April 1908 after over two years of construction work it accommodated a modest 200 rooms but when an additional section was built on Anhalter Strasse 6 in 1912/13 the hotel had already almost doubled in size. The untimely re-opening of the hotel on the eve of World War I meant that the building spent its early existence comparatively empty. As the war progressed the hotel's fortunes dwindled. The saviour of the Excelsior appeared in 1919 in the form of Curt Elschner (1876‚Äì1963). In 1903 he took out a lease on the Hotel Metropol in Erfurt, before taking over the Hotel Esplanade in Hamburg and then a number of other hotels and restaurants across Germany. After his war service Elschner spent a short time in 1919 working as an advisor and frontman to the politician and industrialist Hugo Stinnes, when the latter was elected into parliament in Berlin, before Elschner finally took the reins of the Excelsior.  Excelsior expansion in the golden twenties  Under Elschner's management the 1920s witnessed the Excelsior's transformation from a low-key and ailing enterprise into an extravagant, successful and modern hotel complex. Using contemporary deluxe US hotels as inspiration, Elschner set about completely modernising and expanding his new property. New power and water systems and gas heating were established and the coal-powered bakery and kitchens were introduced to electricity. Between 1925 and 1926 the hotel's guest capacity was expanded under the guidance of architects Heidenreich und Michel. In 1927/28, under the direction of architect Johann Emil Schaudt (1871‚Äì1957), an 1800 m¬≤ area of the hotel cellars was transformed into a spa. an image from an Excelsior travel brochure circa 1931 showing the tunnel connecting the hotel to Anhalter Bahnhof Arguably what established the Excelsior's superior status beyond question was the 1929 construction of an underpass connecting the hotel with the Anhalter Bahnhof across the street. The 80-metre long, 3-metre wide and 3-metre high 1.2 million Reichmark construction, is believed to have been the largest of its type in the world. The tunnel meant that the hotel's privileged guests could travel from their train compartment to their hotel bedroom and back again without ever having to step out into the chaotic bustle of Askanischen Platz. An official railway ticket booth in the hotel meant that they did not even need to bother queuing up at the station either. When the dramatic renovation was complete the Hotel Excelsior accommodated 600 rooms, 750 beds, 250 bathrooms, 9 restaurants, a library, as well as such everyday amenities as a tailors, cobblers, butchers and bakers. It also provided guests with a choice of 200 daily newspapers from around the world. The interior decoration was equally lavish with marble covered walls and adornment by the Berlin-born artist Carl Langhammer (1868‚Äì1956). The Excelsior may not have been as distinguished as Berlin's Adlon, Kaiserhof or Esplanade but it was the largest, and at the end of the twenties it firmly established itself as the largest not only in Berlin, but across the whole continent.  Excelsior in Hitler's thirties  At the start of the 1930s NSDAP leadership in Munich earmarked the Excelsior as Hitler's base in Berlin until he secured leadership. The proposal was rejected by Elschner however and the F√ºhrer was forced to opt for the Hotel Kaiserhof in Wilhelmplatz. The NSDAP did not take the snub with good grace and promptly imposed a party ban on the hotel. Nevertheless, this did not stop them sparking further controversy within its walls. Its grand hall, known as \\"Saal des freien Denkens\\" (The Hall of Free Thought), featured numerous stain-glass windows featuring popes, religious founders and various Greek and Jewish philosophers. The NSDAP objected to the images of Jews and after a violent debate they were packed away in crates and replaced by portraits of the new leadership. They also objected to many of the titles in the hotel library and so these were taken away and burnt.  World War II and the demise of the Excelsior  At the beginning of World War II, Elschner fled Germany and in 1942 the NSV (Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt), a welfare subsidiary of the NSDAP, took over ownership of the Excelsior. It was during the wartime period that the hotel became known as the \\"Fehling-Bunker\\". The title honoured J√ºrgen Fehling, the then director at the theatre in K√∂niggr√§tzer Stra√üe (today known as the Hebbel Theater). A sign hung over the main entrance saying \\"Wehrmacht-Betreuungsstelle (Armed-Forces Care Point) Gep√§ckaufbewahrung (Left Luggage)\\". At the end of April 1945, as the war was coming to an end, Allied bombers reduced the Excelsior to a burning ruin. The attack left many dead and the hotel largely destroyed. Any riches that survived the assault were swiftly plundered. In 1954 it was demolished completely, six years before the remains of the Anhalter Bahnhof were pulled down. Whether or not the underpass that connected them still exists is unclear.  Aftermath  Anhalter train station in the foreground. Between 1967 and 1972 the architect group G. Krebs and Sobotka & M√ºller erected a building with 500 apartments, shops and business offices on the hotel site for the \\"Excelsior-Petrol Station GmbH & Co KG\\". A hotel with the traditional name \\"Hotel Excelsior\\" is located today in the Hardenbergstra√üe in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and is managed by the hotel management company \\"Grand City Hotels & Resort\\".  Legacy The Excelsior was the inspiration for the novel Menschen im Hotel (1929) by the Austrian writer Vicki Baum (1888‚Äì1960). The book in turn inspired the Academy Award winning Hollywood film, Grand Hotel. The hotel appears in Walter Ruttmann's 1927 film Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis. It is believed that it was here, on the 11 November 1918, that Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg's leftist revolutionary group renamed themselves the Spartakusbund (The Spartacus League).

Original family Adam de Lamberton gave a charter of a third part of his land of Lamberton to his grandson, Galfrido de Hasswell between 1190 and 1200.Historic Manuscripts Commission, Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle, N.B., London, 1902: 223 In the National Archives of Scotland (RH1/2/59) there is a charter of Sir Peter de Mordington, knt., son of the deceased Sir William de Mordington, as superior, in favour of Simon de Baddeby of certain lands in Lamberton, dated 1270. A William de Lamberton was superior c. 1318.Historic Manuscripts Commission, Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle, N.B., London, 1902: 226 Barony Some records give Lamberton as a feudal barony; others that it became part of the vast barony assigned to Coldingham Priory. (It may be partly both). Renton family A charter (RH1/2/98) dated November 21, 1325 of Agnes de Mordington, in favour of John de Raynton, thereafter designated as \\"of Lamberton\\", appears to herald the long possession of Lamberton by this family, descendants of the ancient foresters of Coldingham Priory. \\"Robert de Renton, Lord of Lamberton\\" was in possession in 1407.Historic Manuscripts Commission, Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle, N.B., London, 1902: 227 In 1632 David Renton of Billie held \\"the forty husbandlands (1040 acres) of Lambertoun within the lordship of Coldingham\\".Historic Manuscripts Commission, Manuscripts of Colonel David Milne Home of Wedderburn Castle, N.B., London, 1902: 200 By the 18th century the Rentons had passed their ancient estate of Billie to the Homes, but retained Lamberton. The Rentons of Lamberton were in the early 19th century represented by Alexander Renton of Lamberton (d. before March 1831), who was served his father's heir in the lands and mains of Lamberton in 1774, and whose only child, a daughter Susanna, married Robert Campbell, a Colonel in the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment of Foot. Their son, Charles Frederick (1819 - 1891), Colonel in the 87th Regiment of Foot, hyphenated his surname. The Campbell-Rentons of Lamberton, and, later, Mordington House, also failed in the male line with the death in 1948 of Robert Charles Campbell-Renton. Royal connection The now ruined Lamberton Kirk was the church where, in July 1503, Margaret Tudor the daughter of King Henry VII of England, met the representatives of King James IV of Scotland (and traditionally is said to have married him by proxy), thus leading to the eventual succession of James VI to the English throne. Only ruins of the nave and chancel remain, as the burial-place of the Rentons of Lamberton.Strang, Borders and Berwick: 20 Tournament A tournament featuring knights from both England and Scotland participated in a tournament on Lamberton Moor to celebrate the marriage of Margaret Tudor and King James IV.Aikman, J & Gordon, W.

Links with the Earls of Eglintoun Susanna Montgomerie (died 27 July 1754) was the third daughter of Alexander Montgomerie, 9th Earl of Eglinton by his third wife, Susanna Kennedy, daughter of Sir Archibald Kennedy of Culzean. She married (before 1 August 1739) John Renton of Lamberton and had two daughters: Susan Renton who married Sir Robert Murray of Clermont and Hillhead, 6th Bart (died 1771); and Eleonora Renton who married (22 August 1770) Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe of Hoddom (1750‚Äì1813).Montgomery family history at Irregular marriages The now demolished Old Toll House at Lamberton, situated just across the border in Scotland, was notorious for its irregular marriages. From 1798 to 1858 keepers of the Toll, as well as questionable men-of-the-cloth used to marry couples in the same fashion as at the more familiar Gretna Green. The site of the house is marked by a plaque.Steven, Alexander C.A., The Story of Lamberton Toll, 1933 Smallholdings Lamberton today consists largely of smallholdings Williams, John, editor, Smallholding Memories, Berwick-upon-Tweed, 2000 compulsorily purchased, under an Act of Parliament, from the last Campbell- Renton laird, to provide a living for soldiers returning from The Great War. However, the land was not suited to crops, the holdings were too small for anything other than subsistence living, and today the original holdings are generally merged with others to make larger farms. Some modern house-building activity has taken place over the past decade along the original A1 (now bypassed). There is no town or village, as such, just scattered housing, with views over the North Sea. Local government The regional authority today is the Scottish Borders Council, based some to the west at Newtown St. Boswells, Roxburghshire. Lamberton also returns three elected councillors to the Foulden Mordington & Lamberton Community Council, similar to an English parish council, whose meetings rotate between Foulden Village Hall, and Lamberton Hall.

The following year he finished second in the decathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, 688 points behind Jim Thorpe. In 1913, after it was discovered that Thorpe played professional baseball for a minor league team, Thorpe was disqualified for not being an amateur. Wieslander was declared the winner of the 1912 Olympics and awarded the gold medal, which he refused to accept.https://www.abebooks.com/docs/Community/Featured/olympics-crisis.shtml In 1982 Thorpe was reinstated by the IOC with Hugo Wieslander as joint winners of the 1912 Olympic decathlon. Wieslander competed in the long jump, discus throw, shot put and two types of javelin throw at the 1908 Olympics. He completed only the freestyle javelin throw event, in which he placed fifth. At the 1912 Olympics, besides his decathlon achievement he finished seventh in the pentathlon. Nationally Wieslander won four Swedish titles: in the high jump (1907), decathlon (1909) and pentathlon (1910 and 1911); in 1906‚Äì1908 he placed second-third eight times in various jumping and throwing events. In 1913 he passed the state surveying exam and became employed by the Swedish cartography agency (:sv:Rikets allm√§nna kartverk).

The two-hour show is written, hosted and produced by Van Zandt. The show debuted on approximately 30 US stations in 2003 and has become one of the fastest-growing syndicated music radio shows in the US. It is heard by approximately one million listeners in the US each week. It is currently distributed by Sun Broadcast Group.Sun Broadcast Group Parks In Little Steven‚Äôs Underground Garage ;Underground Garage radio channel Host Steven Van Zandt, known as a guitarist and actor on The Sopranos. The other outlet is a 24-hour satellite radio channel (named Underground Garage) heard nationwide in the USA & Canada on Sirius XM Radio channel 21 and via Dish Network satellite TV ‚Äì- and heard worldwide on Sirius/XM Internet Radio. In musical terms, the radio channel is an extension of Van Zandt's own weekly radio show and shares the same philosophy. The radio channel is programmed and run by Van Zandt. The programs are hosted by a team of personalities personally selected by Van Zandt. On-air hosts on the channel include, or have included, original Rolling Stones manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham, punk rock singer Handsome Dick Manitoba, The Mighty Manfred (lead singer of The Woggles), Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom, New York singer/songwriter Jesse Malin, television actor Michael Des Barres, veteran FM radio deejays Kid Leo, Rodney Bingenheimer and Bill Kelly, rock entrepreneur Kim Fowley, actor Drew Carey, and musician/producer Genya Ravan (originally the singer in Goldie & the Gingerbreads). \\"Chris Carter's British Invasion\\", hosted by Chris Carter, appears on the channel each Sunday.https://www.facebook.com/ChrisCartersBritishInvasion As of February 19, 2007, Van Zandt began hosting a regular spot Monday through Friday at 11am, 3pm, and 7pm in between each program. ;Live shows Little Steven's Underground Garage periodically co-sponsors shows, and two events in late April 2014 are scheduled to feature bands with \\"Coolest Songs,\\" including The Connection, John & Brittany, The Jellybricks, and Palmyra Delran. The shows will be hosted by Underground Garage DJ Handsome Dick Manitoba. Approach to music history The music format of both the weekly terrestrial radio show and the 24/7 satellite radio channel is based on Van Zandt's approach to rock 'n' roll history. Van Zandt believes that rock 'n' roll is a continuum from the early 1950s onwards and that it is artificial and counter-productive to segregate music by the decade it was created. So the Underground Garage presents music from every decade since the beginnings of rock 'n' roll in the early 1950s to the present day. Stylistically, the format's offerings span such genres and categories as garage rock, acid rock, girl groups, British Invasion, psychedelic music, rockabilly, surf rock, Motown, proto-punk, power pop and punk rock. The music is fully integrated so that listeners hear recordings by rock pioneers such as Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard and Elvis Presley juxtaposed with records by present-day garage bands like The Contrast ‚Äì and multiple artists from the four decades between. Van Zandt has stated that he hopes to draw younger listeners (who are attracted because of the current artists) to hear the historic acts that paved the way for today's rock. And older listeners (who are attracted because of the vintage artists) to hear the artists who are carrying on the tradition. He has described the format playlist as featuring \\"the bands that influenced the Ramones, the bands that were influenced by the Ramones, and the Ramones.\\"Van Zandt, Steven, interview with Crawdaddy magazine \\"The Coolest Song in the World This Week\\" On both the Sirius XM channel and on the syndicated show, one song is proclaimed as \\"The Coolest Song in the World This Week.\\" At the end of 2006, listeners were invited to choose among the 52 songs to pick the year's best.

The Myc family consists of three related human genes: c-myc (MYC), l-myc (MYCL), and n-myc (MYCN). c-myc (also sometimes referred to as MYC) was the first gene to be discovered in this family, due to homology with the viral gene v-myc. In cancer, c-myc is often constitutively (persistently) expressed. This leads to the increased expression of many genes, some of which are involved in cell proliferation, contributing to the formation of cancer. A common human translocation involving c-myc is critical to the development of most cases of Burkitt lymphoma. Constitutive upregulation of Myc genes have also been observed in carcinoma of the cervix, colon, breast, lung and stomach. Myc is thus viewed as a promising target for anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, Myc possesses several features that render it undruggable such that any anti-cancer drugs for Myc dysregulation will require acting on the protein indirectly, i.e. targeting the mRNA for the protein rather than a small molecule that targets the protein itself. In the human genome, C-myc is located on chromosome 8 and is believed to regulate expression of 15% of all genes through binding on enhancer box sequences (E-boxes). In addition to its role as a classical transcription factor, N-myc may recruit histone acetyltransferases (HATs). This allows it to regulate global chromatin structure via histone acetylation. Discovery The Myc family was first established after discovery of homology between an oncogene carried by the Avian virus, Myelocytomatosis (v-myc; ) and a human gene over- expressed in various cancers, cellular Myc (c-Myc). Later, discovery of further homologous genes in humans led to the addition of n-Myc and l-Myc to the family of genes. The most frequently discussed example of c-Myc as a proto-oncogene is its implication in Burkitt's lymphoma. In Burkitt's lymphoma, cancer cells show chromosomal translocations, most commonly between chromosome 8 and chromosome 14 [t(8;14)]. This causes c-Myc to be placed downstream of the highly active immunoglobulin (Ig) promoter region, leading to overexpression of Myc. Structure The protein product of Myc family genes all belong to the Myc family of transcription factors, which contain bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) and LZ (leucine zipper) structural motifs. The bHLH motif allows Myc proteins to bind with DNA, while the leucine zipper TF- binding motif allows dimerization with Max, another bHLH transcription factor. Myc mRNA contains an IRES (internal ribosome entry site) that allows the RNA to be translated into protein when 5' cap-dependent translation is inhibited, such as during viral infection.  Function  Myc proteins are transcription factors that activate expression of many pro-proliferative genes through binding enhancer box sequences (E-boxes) and recruiting histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Myc is thought to function by upregulating transcript elongation of actively transcribed genes through the recruitment of elongation factors. It can also act as a transcriptional repressor. By binding Miz-1 transcription factor and displacing the p300 co-activator, it inhibits expression of Miz-1 target genes. In addition, myc has a direct role in the control of DNA replication. This activity could contribute to DNA amplification in cancer cells. Myc is activated upon various mitogenic signals such as serum stimulation or by Wnt, Shh and EGF (via the MAPK/ERK pathway). By modifying the expression of its target genes, Myc activation results in numerous biological effects. The first to be discovered was its capability to drive cell proliferation (upregulates cyclins, downregulates p21), but it also plays a very important role in regulating cell growth (upregulates ribosomal RNA and proteins), apoptosis (downregulates Bcl-2), differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal. Nucleotide metabolism genes are upregulated by Myc, which are necessary for Myc induced proliferation or cell growth. There have been several studies that have clearly indicated Myc's role in cell competition. A major effect of c-myc is B cell proliferation, and gain of MYC has been associated with B cell malignancies and their increased aggressiveness, including histological transformation. c-Myc induces MTDH(AEG-1) gene expression and in turn itself requires AEG-1 oncogene for its expression.  Myc-nick  upright=1.5 Myc-nick is a cytoplasmic form of Myc produced by a partial proteolytic cleavage of full-length c-Myc and N-Myc. Myc cleavage is mediated by the calpain family of calcium-dependent cytosolic proteases. The cleavage of Myc by calpains is a constitutive process but is enhanced under conditions that require rapid downregulation of Myc levels, such as during terminal differentiation. Upon cleavage, the C-terminus of Myc (containing the DNA binding domain) is degraded, while Myc-nick, the N-terminal segment 298-residue segment remains in the cytoplasm. Myc-nick contains binding domains for histone acetyltransferases and for ubiquitin ligases. The functions of Myc-nick are currently under investigation, but this new Myc family member was found to regulate cell morphology, at least in part, by interacting with acetyl transferases to promote the acetylation of Œ±-tubulin. Ectopic expression of Myc-nick accelerates the differentiation of committed myoblasts into muscle cells.  Clinical significance  A large body of evidence shows that Myc genes and proteins are highly relevant for treating tumors. Except for early response genes, Myc universally upregulates gene expression. Furthermore, the upregulation is nonlinear. Genes for which expression is already significantly upregulated in the absence of Myc are strongly boosted in the presence of Myc, whereas genes for which expression is low in the absence Myc get only a small boost when Myc is present. Inactivation of SUMO-activating enzyme (SAE1 / SAE2) in the presence of Myc hyperactivation results in mitotic catastrophe and cell death in cancer cells. Hence inhibitors of SUMOylation may be a possible treatment for cancer. Amplification of the MYC gene was found in a significant number of epithelial ovarian cancer cases. In TCGA datasets, the amplification of Myc occurs in several cancer types, including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, and uterine cancers. In the experimental transformation process of normal cells into cancer cells, the MYC gene can cooperate with the RAS gene. Expression of Myc is highly dependent on BRD4 function in some cancers. BET inhibitors have been used to successfully block Myc function in pre-clinical cancer models and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.  Animal models  In Drosophila Myc is encoded by the diminutive locus, (which was known to geneticists prior to 1935). Classical diminutive alleles resulted in a viable animal with small body size. Drosophila has subsequently been used to implicate Myc in cell competition, endoreplication, and cell growth. During the discovery of Myc gene, it was realized that chromosomes that reciprocally translocate to chromosome 8 contained immunoglobulin genes at the break-point. To study the mechanism of tumorigenesis in Burkitt lymphoma by mimicking expression pattern of Myc in these cancer cells, transgenic mouse models were developed. Myc gene placed under the control of IgM heavy chain enhancer in transgenic mice gives rise to mainly lymphomas. Later on, in order to study effects of Myc in other types of cancer, transgenic mice that overexpress Myc in different tissues (liver, breast) were also made. In all these mouse models overexpression of Myc causes tumorigenesis, illustrating the potency of Myc oncogene. In a study with mice, reduced expression of Myc was shown to induce longevity, with significantly extended median and maximum lifespans in both sexes and a reduced mortality rate across all ages, better health, cancer progression was slower, better metabolism and they had smaller bodies. Also, Less TOR, AKT, S6K and other changes in energy and metabolic pathways (such as AMPK, more oxygen consumption, more body movements, etc.). The study by John M. Sedivy and others used Cre-Loxp -recombinase to knockout one copy of Myc and this resulted in a \\"Haplo-insufficient\\" genotype noted as Myc+/-. The phenotypes seen oppose the effects of normal aging and are shared with many other long-lived mouse models such as CR (calorie restriction) ames dwarf, rapamycin, metformin and resveratrol. One study found that Myc and p53 genes were key to the survival of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. Targeting Myc and p53 proteins with drugs gave positive results on mice with CML. Relationship to stem cells c-Myc plays a major role in the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It is one of the original factors discovered by Yamanaka et al. to encourage cells to return to a 'stem-like' state alongside transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4. It has since been shown that it is possible to generate iPSCs without c-Myc.

It was formerly found throughout the Ameca River drainage in Mexico; the type locality is Rio Teuchitl√°n in the vicinity of Teuchitl√°n, Jalisco. The species was only ever found in an area about 10 miles (15 km) in diameter.Miller & Fitzsimons (1971), Kelley et al. (2006) Today, the species is rated as critically endangered by the IUCN.Contreras-Balderas & Almada-Villela (1996) a remnant population has been found to persist in El Rinc√≥n waterpark near the town of Ameca. Possibly, it also exists in a feral state in the United States; individuals apparently derived from escaped or introduced captive stock were met with in southeastern Nevada.Fuller (2006) For some time, it was a popular fish among aquarists, but hobbyist stocks have declined recently, placing its survival in jeopardy.Kelley et al. (2006) Description Female (above) being courted by a young male As its common name implies, it is indeed quite an attractive fish. A dominant mature male specimen a large dorsal fin which like the caudal fin is washed with black. A yellow band stretches along the caudal's back margin. The body of both sexes is ochre, with silvery sides and a brownish back, which in males usually have numerous glittering metallic scales. Females and immatures having black dots on the sides and ochre fins. The fins of males intensify in color when they are excited, and depending on their mood, they can show more or less strongly a black band along the side. For the first two weeks or so after birth, the young are entirely silvery.Miller & Fitzsimons (1971), Tavares [2005] Males can also be told apart from females because their anal fin's front part splits off and transforms to a blunt, flexible andropodium used for mating. As usual in live- bearers, males are the smaller sex, reaching some 3 in (7‚Äì8 cm) total length at best, with females being able to grow up to 4 in (10 cm) under good conditions. Ecology In its former natural habitat, the bedrock is limestone, resulting in a hard and alkaline water with a general hardness of 6-10 dGH, while the temporary (carbonate) hardness is usually between 7 and 11¬∞. The pH is around 8, and temperature varies little between the seasons, but ranges between about 70 and 85 ¬∞F (20 and 30 ¬∞C) between day and night. The vegetation is largely limited to algae and Ceratophyllum hornworts. The remnant wild population coexists with the native blackfin goodea (Goodea atripinnis) and Lerma live-bearer (Poeciliopsis infans), as well as with the common molly (Poecilia sphenops), Oreochromis tilapias, and the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) which presumably have all been introduced.Tavares [2005], Kelley et al. (2006) Among groups of A. splendens, a loose dominance hierarchy develops, in particular in confined environments. Males chase each other about, with the dominant male(s) showing the most splendid coloration. Submissive males will try to retreat from attacks, typically towards the surface, and may shake their head as a calming signal. Like other Goodeidae, butterfly splitfins mate by internal fertilization and spawn fully developed young. The females become sexually mature at about six months of age and can give birth every six to 10 weeks according to the water temperature and the condition of the fish. Mating is preceded by a courtship, where the males present themselves to the females with their heads pointing downwards - up to 45¬∞ from horizontal - and shake the forward part of their bodies. In that respect, they resemble the jeweled splitfin (Xenotoca variata); they do not have a ritualized \\"courtship dance\\" as some other splitfins, but the male sometimes rotates to present either flank to the female. The females respond by shaking their heads. The fry when born can be up to 0.8 in (20 mm) in length, as the females feed the unborn young via trophotaenia which have a similar function as the umbilical cord in humans.Tavares [2005] As a pet Butterfly splitfin being held in captivity at Birdworld The butterfly splitfin has a reputation of being a fin nipper, but being a large and robust fish, it will certainly bully small and delicate species like guppies or small tetras. When housed with less tender species that require similar conditions, it is a great fish for any tank type; even the hardier species of Apistogramma and similar dwarf cichlids make good companions, with water parameters compromising between the splitfins' and the cichlids' requirements at a point similar to most tap water. A. splendens thrives best in clean, well-aerated water, at temperatures around 70-75 ¬∞F (20-25 ¬∞C) and neutral or slightly higher pH, with water hardness between 5 and 10 dGH composed mainly from calcium hardness. They do not tolerate overly low pH and too soft water, and are unsuitable for dedicated rainforest aquaria with low pH and almost-zero hardness (e.g. for most tetras or danionins). Butterfly splitfins are strong swimmers and social fish; they dwell in groups of three to five males and three to seven females in large tanks where they can grow to full size. In small tanks, they stay small, and fewer individuals or no other fish should be kept. Their overall effect on plant growth is beneficial as they keep down algae and clean off detritus. A. splendens breeds quite readily in the aquarium; some floating plants such as Ceratopteris or Ceratophyllum provide protection for young fry. Aggressiveness varies with population density; at high population densities, tank decoration is highly significant in influencing behavior. At least among captive populations, butterfly splitfins become more aggressive if much decoration is placed in the tank. Butterfly splitfins are voracious, and eat most forms of commercial fish food. They take live prey up to the size of week-old guppy fry, but need plant material, ideally green algae, to thrive. They are ideal algae eaters for tanks with small, hard-water cichlids. If not enough algae are available, vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, or green peas are recommended additions to the diet. Fry do not need \\"baby\\" food such as brine shrimp or nauplia, though as in adults, plant food increase growth and vitality. Lighting should be strong, to encourage growth of algae; direct sunlight is ideal. In summer, they can be kept in outside tanks, basins, or small ponds in temperate and warmer areas; they can tolerate overnight air temperatures of 60 ¬∞F (15 ¬∞C) well enough, but should be protected from birds, cats, and other predators. Many zoos and public aquariums maintain colonies of the species. References ;Sources * (2006): Ameca splendens. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database. Gainesville, FL. Revision Date: 12/5/2003.

It was originally established in Queensland, where a discount 'food barn' chain operating as \\"Jack the Slasher\\" was acquired by Woolworths in 1990. It later expanded into New South Wales and became the low-cost supermarket chain for Woolworths, competing with Franklins No Frills and Coles Myer's Bi-Lo. The chain expanded on the purchase of 67 of the Franklins supermarket chain stores in New South Wales and Queensland by Woolworths. The \\"No Frills\\" stores then became Food For Less stores with a more upmarket appearance (edging closer to that of Woolworths) and also launched a new logo at the same time. It is positioned as a budget low-cost chain and while it mainly sells dry groceries and frozen perishables only, a small number of older stores also sell fruit and vegetables. Since 2010 most stores have closed or been refurbished and converted into Woolworths. As of September 2019 no stores remain under the \\"Food For Less\\" banner. The store in Beresfield, NSW has since gone through a renewal and refurbishment and The Food for Less signs were taken down and current Woolworths signs put up in their place in 2018.

Contiguous with West Kirby and Newton, it is part of the West Kirby & Thurstaston Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral. History According to the Domesday Book, Grange (also called Great Caldy, or Caldy Grange) was one of the estates owned by Robert de Rodelent. It later passed into the hands of Basingwerk Abbey, until the dissolution of the Monasteries. In the seventeenth century it became the property of William Glegg who also founded Calday Grange Grammar School, and it remained the property of the Gleggs until 1785, when it was bought by John Leigh, a Liverpool solicitor and property speculator, who refounded the grammar school. He passed it on to his son John Shaw Leigh who later went on to buy Luton Hoo. By the twentieth century the area was in the hands of the trustees of Madame de Falbe, his son John Gerard Leigh's widow, who had remarried to Christian de Falbe, the Danish ambassador. Until 1 April 1974, Grange, along with the rest of the Wirral, was part of the county of Cheshire. Geography Grange is in the north-western part of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-east of the Irish Sea at Hoylake, less than east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and west-south-west of the River Mersey at Seacombe. Grange is situated on the eastern side of the ridge which includes Grange Hill, with the area at an elevation of between above sea level. Education Founded in 1636 local landowner William Glegg founded Calday Grange Grammar School on the present site on Grammar School Lane off Column Road. It was established as a free grammar school is Wirral's oldest surviving grammar school. Glegg's vision that it should have ‚Äòcontinuance and endure for evermore' has certainly been fulfilled and over the years, his little 12 pupil school has been transformed into a dynamic establishment of over 1300 students ‚Äì which includes over 400 male and female students in the Sixth Form. Sport Shooting Grange Rifle and Pistol Club is a private members club which was established in 1942. and offers many types of shooting including air rifle/pistol, black powder pistol, gallery rifle, smallbore rifle, long barreled revolver, fullbore rifle and archery. Swimming Near the grammar school on Gourley's Lane is Calday Grange Swimming Pool which is home to Calday Grange Amateur Swimming Club, West Kirby Amateur Swimming Club, Hoylake Amateur Swimming Club, Woodchurch Swimming Club and the Peninsula Canoe Club. Transport Road The B5139 passes around and through Grange to the north. The B5139 has junctions with the B5192 Saughall Massie Road and the A540 Column Road, the latter of which runs along the western side of Grange.

The name possibly derives from Llan diacon, meaning \\"church of the deacon\\", with the llan- prefix being of Welsh origin. However, it does not have a parish church and probably refers to Woodchurch.In this instance, Llan de chesne would be a Welsh-Norman construct, literally \\"church (built) of oak (wood)\\".

Administratively it is part of the local government ward of Greasby, Frankby and Irby in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral and is within the parliamentary constituency of Wirral West. Larton is located to the north west of the village of Frankby and east of Newton, to which it was historically linked as a combined township. Although Newton contains the majority of the former township's population, Larton's name remains in geographical use with the Larton Livery riding school, Larton Farm and a \\"state of the art\\" veterinary surgery. History The name is of Viking origin, deriving from the Old Norse Leir-t√∫n, meaning \\"clay farmstead\\". Larton was previously combined with the nearby hamlet of Newton as Newton cum Larton, part of West Kirby parish of the Wirral Hundred, in the county of Cheshire. Its population was 49 in 1801 and 44 in 1851. A civil parish from 1866, it was abolished in 1889 and subsumed into the nearby civil parish of Grange. The population of the former Newton cum Larton civil parish had risen to 66 by 1891. Between 1894 and 1933 Larton was part of Wirral Rural District, then Hoylake Urban District until 1974. Geography Larton lies on the western side of the Wirral Peninsula, approximately south-east of the Irish Sea at Hoylake, north-east of the Dee Estuary at West Kirby and about west-south-west of the River Mersey at Seacombe. The hamlet is situated at an elevation of about above sea level. To the immediate north of Larton is the site of RAF West Kirby. Newton Brook joins with Greasby Brook to the north-east of the hamlet.

Background and release Departure from Jellyfish and The Grays Before the recording of Presents Author Unknown, Falkner was the lead guitarist for the San Francisco-based power pop band, Jellyfish. He left the group shortly after the promotional tour for the group's 1990 debut, Bellybutton, due to a lack of promised songwriting credits and lead vocals on the group's songs. After quitting, Falkner reluctantly joined the band The Grays. The group released one record, entitled Ro Sham Bo, in 1994. The band split due to the album's unsuccessful commercial performance. Due to Falkner's previous experiences with bands and his desire to have complete control of his music, he plays nearly all of the instruments on his debut album.

Compositions In an article for HuffPost, writer Tony Sachs describes the album's sound as combining ‚Äúclassic ‚Äò60s songcraft, elements of ‚Äò70s glam-rock, and the new-wave sheen of the ‚Äò80s‚Äù while ‚Äúsounding completely contemporary.‚Äù The album opens with the song ‚ÄúI Live‚Äù which Matthew Greenwald of AllMusic describes as ‚Äúa cross between a mid-'70s Raspberries-like power pop sheen and a modernist approach.‚Äù The song is an ‚Äúemotionally direct love song‚Äù that uses a descending melody for the chorus. Greenwald called the track ‚Äúone of his finest, hook-laden rockers‚Äù and ‚Äúone of the great pop moments of the 1990s.‚Äù After the tracks ‚ÄúMiracle Medicine‚Äù and ‚ÄúHectified‚Äù, the album continues with the song ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Show Me Heaven‚Äù that has been described as using ‚Äúa comfortable, mid-tempo, power pop melodic base‚Äù and ‚Äúan almost tribal, psychedelic rhythm and series of hooks‚Äù to create ‚Äúan ominous atmosphere that is inescapable.‚Äù The song utilizes ‚Äúambient sounds, some classical piano flourishes, and an almost Pete Townshend-inspired chord progression‚Äù which creates what has been described as ‚Äúa monolith of sound‚Äù. The song's lyrical composition has been interpreted to be about love, with flourishes of mortality and reincarnation. The song ‚ÄúBefore My Heart Attacks‚Äù has been described as a mix between ‚Äúpop, folk, and classical‚Äù. It has been compared to the early work of Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson. The lyrics pertain to isolation which is juxtaposed by the song's ‚Äúsubdued yet powerful string arrangement‚Äù. Critical reception The album has received critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Mindy Labernz of The Austin Chronicle described the album as \\"melodious, harmony-laden, and sumptuously produced.\\" She continues by stating that, \\"His songs are not sanitized by their own perfection, nor do they bury emotions under layers of puns and fictions.\\" To summarize, she says that \\"Falkner struggles not to make things too familiar. When he wants to seduce the listener, though, as on the wrenching \\"She Goes to Bed,\\" he is epic. So is much of this album.\\" Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune, states that Presents Author Unknown \\"harks to the days when albums were packed with great songs rather than one hit and filler.\\" He continues by saying that \\"he also takes on a multitude of styles -- neopsychedelia to the near-psychotic.\\" He finishes by saying the album \\"squarely establishes him as a one-man pop combo with great verve.\\" In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Tim Sendra wrote, ‚ÄúWriting, producing, singing, and playing nearly everything except the occasional guitar overdub (and strings), Jason has released a one- man pop tour de force. Hooks abound and won't let you down. The more you listen, the more you'll find yourself humming along. Standout tracks include \\"I Go Astray\\" and \\"Don't Show Me Heaven,\\" but all are worthy of a listen. It's good ol' pop music. Better still, it's good music.‚Äù Commercial performance Despite the album‚Äôs critical success, Author Unknown was a commercial disappointment. Falkner has attributed this to a lack of proper promotion on behalf of his label, Elektra. The label did not provide Falkner with a band to tour in promotion of the album. In an article for The Guardian, Michael Hann argued that the album‚Äôs lack of success was due to the fact that Falkner was ‚Äú...too pretty to be a proper rocker, too tough to be pop, too eccentric for the jocks, too straightforward for the arty people.‚Äù After an attempt to be dropped by the label, Falkner was convinced to stay.

Along with an orally-administered gold salt, auranofin, it is one of only two gold compounds currently employed in modern medicine. Medical uses It is primarily given once or twice weekly by intramuscular injection for moderate-severe rheumatoid arthritis although it has also proven itself effective in treating tuberculosis. Adverse effects Its most common side effects are digestive (mostly dyspepsia, mouth swelling, nausea, vomiting and taste disturbance), vasomotor (mostly flushing, fainting, dizziness, sweating, weakness, palpitations, shortness of breath and blurred vision) or dermatologic (usually itchiness, rash, local irritation near to the injection site and hair loss) in nature, although conjunctivitis, blood dyscrasias, kidney damage, joint pain, muscle aches/pains and liver dysfunction are also common. Less commonly, it can cause GI bleeds, dry mucous membranes and gingivitis. Rarely it can cause: aplastic anaemia, ulcerative enterocolitis, difficulty swallowing, angiooedema, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, cholestatic jaundice, peripheral neuropathy, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, encephalopathy, encephalitis and photosensitivity. Pharmacology Its precise mechanism of action is unknown but is known that it inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins. It also modulates phagocytic cells and inhibits class II major histocompatibility complex-peptide interactions. It is also known that it inhibits the following enzymes: * Acid phosphatase * Beta- glucuronidase * Elastase * Cathepsin G * Thrombin * Microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 History of use Reports of favorable use of the compound were published in France in 1929 by Jacques Forestier. The use of gold salts was then a controversial treatment and was not immediately accepted by the international community. Success was found in the treatment of Raoul Dufy's joint pain by the use of gold salts in 1940; \\"(The treatment) brought in a few weeks such a spectacular sense of healing, that Dufy ... boasted of again having the ability to catch a tram on the move.\\" It was recently discontinued from the US market along with aurothioglucose leaving only auranofin as the only gold salt on the US market.

It was produced by Falkner and Nigel Godrich. The album was supported with singles for the songs ‚ÄúHoliday‚Äù, ‚ÄúEloquence‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMy Lucky Day‚Äù. Falkner's recording contract with Elektra came to an end after the album was met with weak sales numbers. It would be his last solo album for nearly a decade. Background Due to the lack of commercial success of his debut album, Presents Author Unknown, Falkner requested to be dropped by his label Elektra Records. Falkner felt the album could have had a ‚Äúmuch, much larger audience‚Äù and felt that the label's lack of promotion was to blame for its disappointing sales. However, according to Falkner, the label took responsibility for the album's lack of success and requested that he record another album in the same manner he had recorded his debut. The album was co-produced by Nigel Godrich, famous for his work with the band Radiohead. Falkner recalls listening to the album OK Computer and immediately beginning to look through the album's booklet to find who had produced it. He has stated that he worked well with Godrich in producing a sound that was ‚Äúexactly right‚Äù. The album's original working titles were 17A and Amazing the Survivors. Falkner decided against the latter title as he felt it was ‚Äúhard to say‚Äù and could have been ‚Äútaken a little egotistically‚Äù.

He is a glass artisan native to Namorn, and throughout the novel becomes a student of weather-mage Trisana Chandler, despite the fact that at fourteen, she is six years his junior. Character Biography Born to a Namornese family in the glass-crafting business, Keth was trained in glassblowing and the other arts of making glass from a young age, and progressed swiftly, aided by \\"a spark\\" of magic attuned to glass-work. He was betrothed and qualified as a journeyman. When walking on the shore of the Syth, Keth was caught in a thunderstorm and struck by lightning. The injury caused him to become paralyzed. Through rehabilitation, he eventually regained most of his capabilities, although symptoms like tremors and a permanently slurred speech. The injury caused Keth, previously an up-and-coming glass- worker, to become a burden on his family business. When he feared that the glass-workers' guild would take away his journeyman status, he chose instead to travel to Tharios, where his fourth cousin Antonou Tinos kept a glass workshop. In Tharios, Keth lived in a rented room in Khapik, the city-state's pleasure district, where the Tharian entertainers known as yaskedasi live and work. His stay in Khapik caused him to cross paths with the Ghost, a serial killer who operated in Khapik, murdering only female yaskedasi. When the Ghost killed his neighbor, a dancer named Iralima, Keth helped care for her orphaned daughter, Glaki. Though he was working at regaining his skill, Keth was unaware of one of the side-effects of the lightning strike that first debilitated him. Along with the physiological damage, the lightning turned Keth's seed of glass magic into a mixture of glass and lightning magic. The change in his abilities as a mage passed Keth by until it was discovered by a traveling mage, Trisana Chandler, when she saw him at the center of a large, accidental magical working; Keth was attempting to create a glass vase, when his untrained magic drew in spells from all around the neighborhood, which mixed with the glass and a seed of lightning to create a living creature, a dragon made of glass, with lightning blood. Enraged and frustrated by his lack of control over his own craft, Keth attempted to destroy the dragon. Tris, who was berating him for unraveling the spells of others in his magical working, intervened on behalf of the dragon, citing the mages' ethical code that states that a living creature, however accidentally created, should not be killed. She adopted the dragon, naming it \\"Chime\\". Once she found that Keth was a newly discovered, untrained mage, the same ethical code forced her to find him a teacher. Because of the lightning mixed into his magic, no glass-mage in Tharios was willing to teach him, and the job fell to the ranking lightning- mage, Tris herself. The learning experience proved difficult both to Tris, a naturally temperamental person who'd never had a student before, and to Keth, who was dismayed at being taught the basics of magic by a teacher younger than himself. Through meditation, Keth gradually gained some control of his magic, although glassblowing proved most difficult for him to remaster. His first deliberate magical working was a globe of glass lined from within with lightning which, when it cleared, proved to contain a replica of the scene of the Ghost's latest murder. His unintentional knowledge of the Ghost's murders caused both Keth and Tris to fall under the suspicion of the arurim, Tharios's law enforcement. Once Tris succeeded in releasing him from their suspicions, Keth, who was emotionally invested in the case because of the death of his neighbor, began collaborating with Dema Nomasdina, the officer in charge of the investigation. He continually attempted to replicate the glass and lightning globe, hoping to find the scene of the next murder before it took place. Though he eventually managed to create another globe, it was only after the fact, and failed to prevent the murder. Keth continued to create lightning globes containing the scenes of each of the Ghost's murders, each one closer and closer to the time of the victim's death. One of the victims was another of his neighbors, Glaki's foster-mother Yali, with whom he was romantically interested. After Yali's murders, Keth increased his efforts, while the arurim set up an undercover guard in Khapik, hoping to catch the Ghost in the act. With their combined efforts, a murder-in-progress was finally discovered and stopped, although the Ghost escaped. It was Tris who eventually caught him, and when Keth followed her, the Ghost was trapped to his thighs in the earth, and Tris was debating whether or not to kill him. Against Tris's former teacher, Niklaren Goldeye, Keth argued for Tris to kill the Ghost, on grounds that he was a murderer and deserved to die. Tris, however, decided against it. When Tris, Niko and Glaki left Tharios to travel north to Emelan, Keth remained in Tharios, expressing an interest in using his magic for forensics, despite his earlier statement that he'd become a glass-maker in order to create pretty things, not ugly ones.

In 1264 he was created a supposed baron by de Montfort, which title had no legal validity following the suppression of the revolt. Origins He was the only son of Sir Henry de Hastings (died 1250) by his wife Ada of Huntingdon, the youngest of the four daughters of David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon and Maud of Chester. Marriage and children His father died in 1250 when he was a minor and in about 1252 his wardship and marriage were purchased by William III de Cantilupe (d.1254), 3rd feudal baron of Eaton Bray in Bedfordshire, who married him off to the elder of his two daughters, Joan de Cantilupe (d.1271).M Julian-Jones, Thesis on de Cantilupe and Corbet families, 2015, Online Research @Cardiff (ORCA), Cardiff University, p.83 Joan's mother was Eva de Braose, heiress of the Lordship of Abergavenny in Wales. Her brother Sir George de Cantilupe (1251-1273), Lord of Abergavenny, died aged 22, when Joanna and her sister Millicent became the co- heiresses to his vast estates. By his wife he had issue including: *John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings (1262-1313), Lord of Abergavenny, eldest son, summoned to Parliament as Lord Hastings in 1290.

They spoke a set of dialects or closely related languages that have been classified in a variety of ways. The most prominent division, between Northern Cochim√≠ and Southern Cochim√≠, has generally been put to the south of San Ignacio (Mixco 1978, 1979, 2006; Laylander 1997). At one time designated \\"Peninsular Yuman\\", Cochim√≠ bears an evident relationship to the Yuman languages of northern Baja California, southern California, and western Arizona. Mauricio J. Mixco (1978, 2006) reassessed this relationship and judged it to be too distant for Cochim√≠ to be included within the Yuman family proper. He placed Cochim√≠ as a sister language to the Yuman family, thus forming the Yuman‚ÄìCochim√≠ family. The Cochim√≠ were first encountered by Spanish seaborne explorers during the sixteenth century, including Ulloa, Cabrillo, Vizca√≠no, and others. Sporadic encounters continued until the Jesuits established missions on the peninsula in the late seventeenth century. Eusebio Francisco Kino made an abortive foundation at San Bruno, to the north of Loreto, in 1683-1685. Juan Mar√≠a de Salvatierra began the first successful mission in 1697 at Loreto among the Monqui, who were southern neighbors of the Cochim√≠. This was quickly followed by Francesco Maria Piccolo's Cochim√≠ mission at San Javier in 1699. Over the next seven decades, the frontier of Jesuit control over the Cochim√≠ gradually extended northward, with missions at Muleg√© (1705), Comond√∫ (1708), La Pur√≠sima (1720), Guadalupe (1720), San Ignacio (1728), Santa Gertrudis (1751), San Borja (1762), and Santa Mar√≠a (1767). After the Spanish crown expelled the Jesuits from Baja California in 1768, the Franciscans under Jun√≠pero Serra established an additional mission at San Fernando Velicat√° (1769) on their way north to Alta California. The Franciscans' successors in Baja California, the Dominicans, created the final new mission among the Cochim√≠ at El Rosario (1774). Decimated by epidemics of Old World diseases, the Cochim√≠ population declined, until sometime in the nineteenth or possibly the early twentieth century their language and traditional culture became extinct. The Cochim√≠ were hunter-gatherers, without agriculture or metallurgy. Pottery-making may have reached the northern Cochim√≠ before Spanish contact (Rogers 1945). Their material culture was generally simple, but it suited their arid environment and mobile lifestyle. The highest level of social organization was the autonomous local community, and inter-community conflicts appear to have been frequent. Among the unusual cultural traits noted for the Cochim√≠ and some of their neighbors were the second harvest of the pitahaya, the maroma, wooden tablas, and human-hair capes: * The fruit of pitahaya cactus provided a highly valued but short-lived seasonal food resource. Subsequent to the pitahaya harvest, Baja Californians winnowed undigested pitahaya seeds from their own dried excrement and then roasted and ate this \\"second harvest\\". * Another unusual food trait was the maroma. A valued morsel of meat was tied with a string, swallowed, then pulled back up and passed to the next person in a circle of consumers, until the meat finally disintegrated. * Tablas were wooden tablets with painted designs and/or drilled holes, used in religious ceremonies. Some of these artifacts have been found archaeologically (Massey 1972; Hedges 1973; Meigs 1974). * Capes made from donated human hair were worn by shamans on ceremonial occasions (Meigs 1970). Information on Cochim√≠ customs and beliefs has been preserved in the brief observations by explorers but, above all, in the writings of the Jesuits (Aschmann 1959; Laylander 2000; Mathes 2006). Particularly important and detailed are the works of Miguel Venegas (1757, 1979) and Miguel del Barco (1973). Language The Cochim√≠ language was part of the Yuman‚ÄìCochim√≠ family.

The hill is south of St Just and east of Sennen Cove, and just to the north of the A30 London to Land's End road, which runs through the village of Crows-an-Wra. It should not be confused with another Carn Brea, the hill overlooking the Camborne‚ÄìRedruth area.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Chapel Carn Brea is often described as the first hill in Cornwall (from a westerly perspective) and rises above sea level. History Neolithic remains at the summit of Chapel Carn Brea The hill is an important historical site showing evidence of neolithic and early Bronze Age activity, as well as the remains of the thirteenth century chapel from which it is named. On the slopes and summit there were once eleven barrows, but only seven now remain, mostly in a poor state. To the west of the summit is an early neolithic long cairn with dimensions of long and built within a natural granite outcrop which extends it length by . On the summit is a diameter entrance grave (also known as chambered cairn) which had a south-facing entrance and was built in the late neolithic. The chamber was long, wide and high. This type of cairn is unique to west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, and consist of a long narrow chamber covered with large slabs and surrounded with a kerb of large stones; they are thought to be communal burial places. The entrance grave was later covered by a large cairn high and across with three concentric retaining walls and a secondary cist. The chapel, which was built on top of the cairn, was pulled down in 1816 and was said to be the home of holy men or monks. A manuscript from 1396 kept at the County Records Office, Truro records the ‚Ä≤beaconage‚Ä≤ received from fishermen for the burning an ‚Ä≤ecclesiastical light‚Ä≤, normally a brazier or fire basket at the ‚Ä≥Chapel of St Michael of Bree‚Ä≥. This is the earliest record of a navigational light in Cornwall. In 1868 and 1879 William Copeland Borlase excavated the site and built a new cairn which was destroyed by the building of a Second World War radar observation post, which was manned by the Royal Air Force. A plaque, near the car park is dedicated to those that served there. The Old Cornwall Society continues to light a beacon fire for the summer solstice on 23 June each year.
