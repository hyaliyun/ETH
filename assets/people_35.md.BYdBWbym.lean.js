Later editions were issued by Ace Books (September 1987, reprinted May 1991) and Tor Books (February 2002). The first British edition was published by Sphere Books in 1989. Plot summary In Shadizar, Conan encounters Khassek, an agent for the Shah of Iranistan, whose master wants to obtain the 'Eye of Erlik, now in the barbarian's possession. Conan accompanies him on Kassek's excursion towards Iranistan. However, their journey is interrupted by his rival Isparana, on the run with Sarid, a renegade soldier from Turan. Both Khassek and Sarid are killed in their confrontation with a giant scorpion. Soon, Conan abandons his mission, joins forces with Isparana, and travels instead for Zamboula. They're attacked by a band of raiders, who in turn are attacked by another tribe of raiders, the Shanki, who, victorious, escort the couple back to their oasis. At their village, Akhimen Khan, leader of the Shanki, welcomes the two and sends them on to Zamboula. Things are not well in Zamboula, however. The ruler, Akter Khan, has been corrupted by the power of his sorcerer, Zafra, who has enchanted two swords with his magic, one of which is in the possession of Khan. Secretly, Zafra is conspiring against him with the Khan's mistress Chia. Both the Khan and Zafra desire the 'Eye of Erlik. Magically aware of its approach, Zafra has his soldiers intercept Conan and Isparana near a canyon. Soon, the soldiers escort them the remainder of their way to the city, where they present the artifact to Akter Khan. Soon Zafra poisons the khan's mind against them and persuades the khan to imprison rather than reward them. Isparana is taken, but Conan is absent. Learning of the khan's ill-will, he joins forces with the rebel Balad and the tribesman Hajimen, son of his Shanki host, both of whom have grievances against the ruler. Conan is captured attempting to rescue Isparana, and Zafra attempts to dispatch him with his magic sword, which fights of its own accord. Conan staves off the flying sword long enough that it turns on its own master, as its enchantment requires it be slaked with blood. With the sorcerer out of the picture, the barbarian goes on to locate and free Isparana. The two confront the khan, who attempts to slay them with his own magic sword only to find it ineffective, as Zafra had tricked him, binding it to his will alone. Meanwhile, the Zamboulan guards have been overcome by the forces of Hajimen and Balad, the latter of whom slays Ahkter Khan and claims the throne for his own. Balad, proving no better than his predecessor, turns against Conan, only to fall victim to the mortally wounded Zafra, who, crawling into the room, commands the late khan's sword to attack. As Balad is the closest person to the weapon, it dispatches him; Conan beheads Zafra before the sorcerer can issue a second command to the sword. The rulership of Zamboula now passes to Akter Khan's son Jungir, to whom Isparana promptly attaches herself. Conan leaves the city.

It is near the Hume Highway, the F5 Freeway and on the Main Southern railway line. Its station is served by NSW TrainLink's Southern Highlands Line. It is about 80 km southwest of Sydney. In 2016, Douglas Park had a population of 1,362. History The area is in the lands of the Gandangara people and the Tharawal people. The first European settlement was named Hoare Town. The area is named thus on a map made by Surveyor General Sir Thomas Mitchell, in 1865.The razor back obstruction and roads planned to avoid it shewing also Mr. Shone's central line of railway Map in State Library of NSW.

The most common responses for religion were Catholic 32.7%, Anglican 28.7% and No Religion 17.0%. Religious organisations The Church of the Sacred Heart began as the town‚Äôs community hall, which was built in 1937, and consecrated as a Catholic church two years later. It is located on the south side of the railway station, and is now known as the 'Catholic Community Hall'. Douglas Park is home to a Catholic religious community known as the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, at Saint Mary's Towers in Douglas Park Drive. The community includes an historic sandstone house that was once the home of famous New South Wales surveyor Sir Thomas Mitchell. The house, first known as Park Hall, was completed in 1845. The Saint Mary's Towers Retreat Centre is also located here, utilising the historic novitiate and junior seminary buildings, and the local Catholic community of Douglas Park and Wilton is based here and uses the historic, timber Sacred Heart Church for their liturgical celebrations. The Missionaries of the Sacred Heart have lived in community here since 1904, and so \\"the Towers\\" - as it is affectionately known - has been the focus of the local Catholic (and wider) community for more than 100 years.http://towersretreat.abundance.org.au/index.html The Douglas Park Evangelical Church meets each Sunday at 10:00am in the Community Hall. It has met here for over 14 years. It has members from all walks of life and towns around the Wollondilly area.

Released after the massive success of their previous effort, Tubthumper, it commented on various aspects of the pop culture the band had inadvertently become a part of. It achieved this by the heavy inclusion of sound bites, pop culture and commercial culture references and even a small amount of self-parody.  Recording  About 8 months after the release of Tubthumper, Chumbawamba returned to the studio to work on a follow- up record. They recorded a full 10-song album, but decided it was too similar to its predecessor, so they scrapped it and started over. Critical reception The album was subject to polarized reviews from music critics upon its release. Some critics were extremely positive regarding the album. Robert Christgau awarded the album an \\"A-\\" and praised it as \\"an unslackening stream of infectious invective and simplistic satire,\\" going on to praise \\"Hey Hey We're the Junkies\\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine also praised the album, giving it 4 stars and felt that although the album didn't contain any obvious hit singles and was rather short, concluding that the record \\"delivers far more than anyone could have expected, especially anyone that considered the group one-hit wonders.\\" Some critics' feelings regarding the album were more mixed. MTV Asia gave the album 7 out of 10 and commented that the album was \\"very different\\" from its predecessor, going on to question the album's subtlety but concluding that the album demonstrates great range, positing that \\"all the eccentricities of the album, however, are offset by sweet melodies.\\" Entertainment Weekly, though praising the record's melodies and temper, felt that some of the songs' topics (such as album stickering and Rock Hudson) \\"are thumpingly dated.\\" However, some critics were extremely negative regarding the album. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield awarded the album 1 and a half stars out of 5, commenting that the album sounds like \\"a self-imitating mishmash of shout-along choruses, tepid beats and confused eclectic diddling\\", deeming the album \\"bumbling adult pop\\". Louis Pattison's review for Amazon.co.uk was also negative, deeming the songs \\"soulless\\" and \\"saccharine\\" and commenting that the album lacks subtlety and tact.  Commercial performance  Upon its release, the album was a commercial failure for Chumbawamba, causing them to leave EMI a year later, due to disputes. However, in the United States, Republic/Universal handled releases for MUTT Records, especially Readymades, but dropped the band from the label in 2004, allowing them to sign onto Koch Records.

The original Fernet is approximately 40% alcohol (Italian version 41%), whereas the Citrus is a lower 30%. History In 1884, Lionello Stock founded during the crisis after the Panic of 1873 the Camis & Stock company in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and distributed its products throughout the empire. Its flagship product was cognac, but following the end of the First World War, trade between the countries from the empire became more difficult. Stock bought a distillery in Bo≈ækov (a village near Plze≈à) and founded a subsidiary called Stock Cognac Medicinal. At first, spirits transported from Trieste were be bottled there. Cognac or brandy were long the firm's flagship products. The plant began gradually operating independently and shipments from Trieste came to an end. In 1927, the Pilsen company Stock Cognac Medicinal Bo≈ækov u Plznƒõ began with its production of a bitter liqueur Fernet Stock.Stock History It was however hit by the Great Depression in 1929 and then seized by the Nazis as Jewish property in 1939, and ending up as national property by the end of the Second World War. Although Lionello Stock regained possession briefly in 1947, it was nationalized in 1948. Fernet Stock's popularity only increased through the 1960s and 70s, and following the Velvet Revolution, its sales increased dramatically. In the nineties, sales of the popular liqueurs grew by 500%. In 1997, Stock Plze≈à introduced the Fernet Stock Citrus, which over the two years became the second most popular Czech alcoholic spirit right behind Fernet Stock.

Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 206 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Like Villard noir, Villard blanc was produced as a crossing of two Seibel grapes, in this case, Le Subereux and Seibel 6468.Villard blanc , Vitis International Variety Catalogue, Accessed: February 21st, 2011 Villard noir was once widely grown in the South West France wine region with some plantings also found in Bordeaux. The variety reaches its peaked in the late 1960s when there was more than 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares) of Villard noir planted throughout France. (And an additional 21,000 hectares of its white skin sibling, Villard blanc). By 1968, Villard noir was the fifth most widely planted black-skin grape in France and Villard blanc the third most widely planted white-skin variety. However, from that peak its numbers soon declined as French authorities attributed the proliferation of hybrid varieties as a cause of the growing wine lake problem in France and ordered the uprooting of many varieties. Since 1977 Appellation d'Origine Contr√¥l√©e (AOC) laws have forbidden the planting of the Villard grapes in France. Despite being a hybrid grape variety, plantings of Villard noir are normally grafted onto Vitis berlandieri rootstock. Although susceptible to botrytis and powdery mildew, the vine is virtually immune to downy mildew and can be found in American wine regions on the east coast where mildew is often a problem. Today, is commonly used as a blending grape for table wine or in the production of distilled beverages. History In the early 20th century, Bertille Seyve and his father-in-law Victor Villard picked up on the work of French physician and viticulturalist Albert Seibel and began experimenting with Seibel grape in the creation of new varieties. Working with these grapes, Seyve and Villard created the popular Seyval blanc variety, which became an important grape in the wine industry of the United Kingdom, and the two Villard varieties, which became popular in France. A few reasons for the Villards‚Äô popularity were the varieties‚Äô relative ease of cultivation, their resistance to downy mildew, and prolific yields. Plantings of the varieties increased for the devastation of the war years following World War I and World War II with the Villards hitting their peak in the French wine industry during the 1960s. By 1968, Villard noir was the fifth most widely black skin grape variety (behind such notable Vitis vinifera varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) while Villard blanc was the third most planted white grape variety (behind Ugni blanc and Chardonnay). During these peak years there were more than 30,000 and 21,000 hectares of Villard noir and blanc, respectively, planted over a swatch of southern France that stretched from Bordeaux all the way to the northern Rhone. But this peak period was short lived as hybrid grape varieties became a source for scorn and blame from French authorities and growers of exclusively vinifera fruit for the wine lake phenomenon that troubled the European wine industry for much of the 20th century. For the rest of the century, both Villard varieties as well as several other hybrid grapes (like Baco noir, Chambourcin, Couderc and Plantet) were targeted by aggressive vine-pull schemes where growers were paid substantial amounts to uproot their vineyards and either replant with more \\"noble grapes\\" or different agriculture crops. These efforts were highly successful and by the end of the 1980s, the numbers for Villard noir had dropped to 2,500 hectares and for Villard blanc to 4,600 hectares. Further fueled by changes to French wine laws in the 1970s that prohibited the use of hybrid grapes in AOC wines and banned future plantings, both grapes were virtually eradicated from French vineyards by the turn of the 21st century. Wine regions While the Villard grapes were once widely planted throughout southern France, particularly in the wine regions of the southwest, and could be found in Bordeaux as well the vineyards of the northern Rh√¥ne Valley, today it is virtually eradicated from France. The few exceptions are isolated old vine plantings in the departments of Ard√®che and Tarn which survived the vine- pulling period of the late 20th century. Today, both Villard grapes can be found in limited plantings in various American wines regions including Missouri, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, Virginia, Indiana, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma.

She was active in the women's suffrage movement, marching in NYC suffrage demonstrations as a flagbearer from 1913-1917. Herbert died in 1926; Cora lived until 1960. Education In 1844, after showing his father a painting of his mother that the former viewed as a success, Carpenter was allowed to go to Syracuse, New York for six months to study under Sanford Thayer. In 1848, at age 18, he was awarded a purchase prize by the American Art-Union. By the age of twenty-one, Carpenter established a studio in New York City.A Genealogical History of the Rehoboth Branch of the Carpenter Family in America. Also known as the Carpenter Memorial Carpenter was elected to the National Academy of Design as an associate member in 1852. Early career In 1852, Carpenter was commissioned to paint a portrait of President Millard Fillmore, a fellow upstate New Yorker born in Cayuga County. Commissions followed for portraits of Presidents Franklin Pierce and John Tyler, and other mid-19th century notables, including the clergyman Henry Ward Beecher; newspaper editor Horace Greeley; Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell University; James Russell Lowell, poet; and John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate. First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln According to his memoir, Six Months at the White House, Carpenter was deeply moved by Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, calling it \\"an act unparalleled for moral grandeur in the history of mankind.\\" Carpenter felt \\"an intense desire to do something expressive of... the great moral issue involved in the war.\\" Carpenter, having formulated his idea for the subject of the painting and outlined its composition, fortuitously met Frederick A. Lane, a friend who recently had earned a large amount of money. Bankrolled by Lane, and through the influence of Samuel Sinclair of the New York Tribune and Representative Schuyler Colfax of Indiana, Carpenter gained Lincoln's assent to travel to Washington and work with him on the painting. Carpenter met with the President on February 6, 1864, and then began work. Carpenter began with many sketches of Cabinet members and of Lincoln himself, working from life, as Lincoln worked, and from photographs taken by Mathew Brady of Lincoln and members of his Cabinet. Carpenter was given free access to Lincoln's White House office for the former purpose, and the State Dining Room was given him for a studio. On July 12, 1864, Lincoln led his cabinet into the State Dining Room to view the completed work. When Lincoln had the painting exhibited to the public in the East Room of the White House, Carpenter noted that the exhibition was thronged with visitors. Carpenter campaigned for Congress to purchase the painting, enlisting the help of fellow Homer native William O. Stoddard, Lincoln's private secretary. Congress did not appropriate the money. The painting remained in Carpenter's possession until 1877, when he arranged for Elizabeth Thompson to purchase it for $25,000 and donate it to Congress. A joint session of Congress was held in 1878, on Lincoln's birthday, to serve as a reception for the painting, with the artist present. Later career and death Following Lincoln's assassination, Carpenter produced many portraits of Lincoln and his family; some based on memory, others on photographs provided by Lincoln's widow. Carpenter's skills were in decline by this time. One admirer of Carpenter's early work even wondered if a later portrait of Lincoln was a forgery. Among the notable portraits painted by Carpenter, aside from Lincoln, were those of President Fillmore and Governor Myron H. Clarke, painted in the New York City Hall; Horace Greeley (a portrait owned by the Tribune Association); Asa Packer, founder of Lehigh University; James Russell Lowell; New York banker David Leavitt; Dr. Lyman Beecher; Henry Ward Beecher and others. By the late 1870s, Carpenter became increasingly interested in religion and spirituality; art historian Mary Bartlett Cowdrey believed \\"that religious obsession somehow undermined Carpenter's work\\". Carpenter died in New York City‚Äîa brief obituary appearing in The New York Times misstated the title of his most famous work. Carpenter died of \\"dropsy\\" an old-fashioned term for EdemaSee also: Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. 2, by A. Johnson, page 510. Copyright 1995 by Grolier Electronic Publishing, Inc. See also: https://web.archive.org/web/19991103094537/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/4035/fbc.htm on May 23, 1900 in New York and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Homer, Cortland County, New York. Criticism and later exhibitions of Carpenter's work Carpenter's legacy has been decidedly mixed, according to a retrospective of Carpenter's career written for the American Art Journal. Cowdrey attempted a full-scale biography that might have helped his reputation, but became frustrated by lack of interest on the part of Carpenter's family. Contemporary critic Henry T. Tuckerman acknowledged Carpenter's \\"facility in capturing a likeness\\" but \\"criticized the artist's lack of 'grace' and 'vitality'\\". The United States Senate Catalogue of Fine Art observes that First Reading, as it hangs today in the Capitol, contains a much weaker portrait of Lincoln than the engraving made from it. This is due to Carpenter's obsessive tinkering with the original painting while he had it in his possession. In 2006, an exhibition of portraits by Carpenter was shown at the Center for the Artshttp://www.center4art.org/ in Homer, New York. Portraits by Carpenter of several figures of local historical interest were exhibited. Loans of the works were obtained from community members, the Phillips Free Library in Homer, and the Homer Central School District. Portrait of Mary Lincoln First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, photographed by Mathew Brady. Compare to the forged portrait here. On February 12, 1929, The New York Times reported the discovery of a new painting of Mary Lincoln. It reported that this painting was by Francis Bicknell Carpenter. This painting was reproduced in different biographies and books such as Mary Lincoln: Wife and Widow by Carl Sandburg, printed in 1932. The owner, Ludwig Pflum (aka Lew Bloom), sold it through the Milch Galleries in New York. It was acquired by Jessie Harlan Lincoln, the President's and Mary Lincoln's granddaughter. There is no record of what the painting sold for.Bauman, Barry. (2012) Case Study: The Demise of Mary Lincoln: An Artistic Conspiracy. http://baumanconservation.com/TheDemiseofMaryLincolnfs.html.Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum Collection file LR 938. Pflum, a former vaudeville performer who dabbled in painting on the side, as Lew Bloom, claimed the painting of Mary Lincoln had not yet been presented and done in secret at the bequest of Mrs. Lincoln by the painter Francis Carpenter. After the assassination of President Lincoln, Bloom claimed Mrs. Lincoln refused it and the painting was sold to a Philadelphia shipbuilder, Jacob G. Neafi. Bloom also claimed that after the death of Mrs. Neafie, Mr. Neafie gave the painting to Susan Bloom for her kindness and caring for Mrs. Neafie through her long illness. Bloom went on to claim that he inherited the painting from his sister after her death in 1910. As it turns out, Susan Bloom was five years old when Mrs. Neafie died in 1860. This painting remained in the Lincoln family until 1976, later estimated at a value of about $400,000 US dollars, when it was given to the Illinois State Historical Library, now named the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. During a 2011 restoration by art conservator Barry Bauman, it was found to be a forgery. The forgery overpainted an original oil portrait of an unknown woman, painted circa the 1860s, that was modified by painting out a crucifix, adding an Abraham Lincoln brooch with other adjustments such as forging Francis Bicknell Carpenter's signature. Bauman is quoted to say, \\"Not only is it not Mary Lincoln, it's not Francis Carpenter.\\"This quote is drawn from Barry Bauman's Case Study: The Demise of Mary Lincoln: An Artistic Conspiracy.

The company is India's 2nd largest downstream oil company and is ranked 275th on the Fortune list of the world's biggest corporations as of 2019. BPCL ranked 672 in the Forbes 2018 list.  History  1891 to 1976 The company today known as BPCL started off as Rangoon Oil and Exploration company set up to explore the new discoveries off Assam and Burma during the British colonial rule of India. In 1889 during vast industrial development, an important player in the South Asian market was the Burmah Oil Company. Though incorporated in Scotland in 1886, the company grew out of the enterprises of the Chef Rohit Oil Company, which had been formed in 1871 to refine crude oil produced from primitive hand dug wells in Upper Burma. In 1928, Asiatic Petroleum Company (India) started cooperation with Burma oil company. Asiatic Petroleum was a joint venture of Royal Dutch, Shell and Rothschilds formed to address the monopoly of John D Rockefeller's Standard Oil, which also operated in India as Esso. This alliance led to the formation of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited. Burmah Shell began its operate operations with import and marketing of Kerosene. In the mid 1950s, the company began to sell LPG cylinders to homes in India and further expanded its delivery network. It also marketed kerosene, diesel and petrol in cans in order to reach remote parts of India. In 1951, the Burmah shell began to build a refinery in Trombay (Mahul, Maharashtra) under an agreement with the Government of India. Nationalisation In 1976, the company was nationalized under the Act on the Nationalisation of Foreign Oil companies ESSO (1974), Burma Shell (1976) and Caltex (1977). On 24 January 1976, the Burmah Shell was taken over by the Government of India to form Bharat Refineries Limited. On 1 August 1977, it was renamed Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. It was also the first refinery to process newly found indigenous crude Bombay High. BPCL petrol filling station near Nakirekal, Telangana, India BPCL petrol filling station at Basaveshwaranagar, Bangalore, Karnataka, India In 2003, the government attempted to privatize the company. However, following a petition by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation, the Supreme Court restrained the Central government from privatizing Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum without the approval of Parliament. As counsel for the CPIL, Rajinder Sachar and Prashant Bhushan said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalized in the 1970s. As a result, the government would need a majority in both houses to push through any privatization. Parliament enacted the Repealing and Amending Act, 2016 in May 2016 which repealed the legislation that had nationalized the company. In 2017, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) received Maharatna status, putting it in the category of government-owned entities in India with the largest market capitalization and consistently high profits. status on 12 September 2017. On 21 November 2019, the Government of India approved the privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The government invited bids for the sale of its 52.98% stake in the company on 7 March 2020.

Pie funnels were used to prevent pie filling from boiling up and leaking through the crust by allowing steam to escape from inside the pie. They also supported the pastry crust in the center of the pie, so that it did not sag in the middle, and are occasionally known as \\"crustholders\\". Older ovens had more problems with uniform heating, and the pie bird prevented boil-over in pie cooking. The traditional inverted funnels, with arches on the bottom for steam to enter, were followed by ceramic birds; and from the 1940s they have been produced in a multitude of designs.

The Savings Bank of South Australia was founded in 1848, trading from a single room in Gawler Place, Adelaide. In 1984 it merged with the State Bank of South Australia, with the merged entity taking the latter name. The Bank of South Australia (also known as BankSA) is now a division and a trading name of St.George Bank, which is now a subsidiary of Westpac. History The Savings Bank of South Australia first opened on 11 March 1848 with a single employee, John Hector, trading from a room in Adelaide's Gawler Place. The room was provided rent-free by the Glen Osmond Mining Company. On that day it took its first deposit, of ¬£29, from an illiterate Afghan shepherd whose name was recorded as Croppo Sing (although the Sikh masculine surname is correctly spelt \\"Singh\\"). Other deposits soon followed. A month later, the fledgling bank made its first loan, of ¬£500, to John Colton. Colton became a successful businessman and later politician, and in 1875 was appointed to the bank's board of trustees. The bank was based on the savings bank movement first advocated by the Scotsman Rev. Henry Duncan. Prior to the advent of the savings bank movement, commercial banks were not interested in taking small deposits from working-class men as the book work involved was more expensive than any potential benefit to the bank. Duncan believed that great benefit to society would result from encouraging the working class to deposit their savings in a bank and teaching the working class the important virtues of thrift . Penny Bank Department In 1907 the Savings Bank of South Australia established the Penny Bank Department to take deposits as little as one penny from school children. These school savings account quickly became popular and almost every public and private school in the state was permitted to take deposits from children on behalf of the bank. School banking was instrumental in instilling the savings mentality in children and helped to make the bank the largest in South Australia. Growth and Development During the 26-year era of Liberal Premier Sir Thomas Playford, the bank was a key tool of his vision for the SA's rapid economic and industrial development. Playford used both the Savings Bank and the State Bank to finance ETSA and the Housing Trust. The two state owned banks complemented each other. The Savings Bank was for the people to deposit their savings and for others to borrow money for mortgages on fair terms, while the State Bank was used for larger projects. During this period the bank took on many new customers, especially migrants brought out to South Australia under assisted migration schemes. Merger SA Labor Premier Don Dunstan first floated the idea of merging the State Bank and the Savings Bank, but the conservative trustees of the bank were strongly opposed to this idea and highly suspicious of the Labor Party. Early in his premiership, Dunstan had got the trustees offside by deceiving them by stating he intended to pass some minor annual leave changes through the Parliament, while actually changing the formation of the board and allowing the Labor Government to appoint the chairman of the Savings Bank and allowing trustees to sit on both boards, this had effect of giving control of the banks to Labor Party and not the trustees who had ably served both of the banks for many decades. Dunstan also had raided both of the banks of their reserve funds to pay for his health, education and arts schemes.Dunstan, pp. 174‚Äì175. After Dunstan had changed the composition of the banks boards they requested the Labor government for a merger, however Labor lost the 1979 election and Liberal Premier David Tonkin would not allow the banks to merge. Under the Labor Premier John Bannon, the two banks were merged. The combined bank 'The State Bank of South Australia' had rapid growth in the boom of the 1980s. However at the end of any boom there is a bust and the State Bank of SA like the State Bank of Victoria was unable to withstand the Keating recession of the early 1990s. The State Bank of SA had failed because it had a 'non- performing' loan portfolio, in other words repayments were not made on money lent.

In humans is encoded by the IDO1 gene. IDO is involved in tryptophan metabolism. It is one of three enzymes that catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway, the O2-dependent oxidation of L-tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine, the others being indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO2) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO). IDO is an important part of the immune system and plays a part in natural defense against various pathogens. It is produced by the cells in response to inflammation and has an immunosuppressive function because of its ability to limit T-cell function and engage mechanisms of immune tolerance. Emerging evidence suggests that IDO becomes activated during tumor development, helping malignant cells escape eradication by the immune system. Expression of IDO has been described in a number of types of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer. IDO is part of the malignant transformation process and plays a key role in suppressing the anti-tumor immune response in the body, so inhibiting it could increase the effect of chemotherapy as well as other immunotherapeutic protocols.  Physiological function  Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is the first and rate- limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism through the kynurenine pathway. IDO is an important molecule in the mechanisms of tolerance and its physiological functions include the suppression of potentially dangerous inflammatory processes in the body. IDO also plays a role in natural defense against microorganisms. Expression of IDO is induced by interferon-gamma, which explains why the expression increases during inflammatory diseases or even during tumorigenesis. Since tryptophan is essential for the survival of pathogens, the activity of enzyme IDO destroys them. Microorganisms susceptible to tryptophan deficiency include bacteria of genus Streptococcus or viruses such as herpes simplex or measles. One of the organs with high IDO expression is the placenta. In the 1990s, the immunosuppressive function of this enzyme was first described in mice due to the study of placental tryptophan metabolism. Thus, mammalian placenta, due to intensive tryptophan catabolism has the ability to suppress T cell activity, thereby contributing to its position of immunologically privileged tissue.  Clinical significance  IDO is an immune checkpoint molecule in the sense that it is an immunomodulatory enzyme produced by alternatively activated macrophages and other immunoregulatory cells. IDO is known to suppress T and NK cells, generate Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and also supports angiogenesis. These mechanisms are crucial in the process of carcinogenesis. IDO allows tumor cells to escape the immune system by two main mechanisms. The first mechanism is based on tryptophan depletion from the tumor microenvironment. The second mechanism is based on the production of catabolic products called kynurenins, that are cytotoxic for T lymphocytes and NK cells. Overexpression of human IDO (hIDO) is described in a variety of human tumor cell lineages and is often associated with poor prognosis. Tumors with increased production of IDO include prostate, ovarian, lung or pancreatic cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. Expression of IDO is under physiological conditions regulated by the Bin1 gene, which can be damaged by tumor transformation. Emerging clinical studies suggest that combination of IDO inhibitors with classical chemotherapy and radiotherapy could restore immune control and provide a therapeutic response to generally resistant tumors. Enzyme IDO used by tumors to escape immune surveillance is currently in focus of research and drug discovery efforts, as well as efforts to understand if it could be used as a biomarker for prognosis.  Inhibitors  COX-2 inhibitors down-regulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, leading to a reduction in kynurenine levels as well as reducing proinflammatory cytokine activity. 1-Methyltryptophan is a racemic compound that weakly inhibits indoleamine dioxygenase, but is also a very slow substrate. The specific racemer 1-methyl --tryptophan (known as indoximod) is in clinical trials for various cancers. Epacadostat (INCB24360) and navoximod (GDC-0919) are potent inhibitors of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzyme and are in clinical trials for various cancers. BMS-986205 is also in clinical trials for cancer.

Askia Musa or Askiya Musa (ruled 1529-1531) was the 2nd Soninke ruler of the Songhai Empire. Towards the end of his reign, Askia Mohammad had become increasingly dependent on Ali Fulan, the Hugu-koray-koi (Master of the Palace interior). On one occasion, Ali advised that his young son Balla be appointed to the vacant position of Benga-farma (governor of Benga). When the older sons of Askia heard about this, they were angered as the post of Benga was very prestigious. Musa (his son) in particular was angry at his father and with Ali Fulan, he claimed that Askia did nothing but what Ali told him. The closeness arose because Askia had become blind, however none of the sons were aware of it because Ali Fulan stuck so close to his side as aid (at this time blindness would have disqualified a ruler as he would have been expected to lead his army into battle, as well as being a bad omen). Musa resolved to depose his aging father Askia Mohammad I, this he achieved on 15 Aug 1529 in a bloodless coup. He then battled his kin to retain his position of power, in the process killing a number of his brothers and between 25 and 35 of his cousins.

Reception John Duffy of AllMusic noted that \\"the general shift in direction may alienate a few long-term fans, but much like friends Wilco achieved with their adventurous Summerteeth, Smile's modern touches may bring even more people into the band's orbit\\", concluding that \\"what never changes on the Jayhawks' albums, it seems, are the blissful melodies and well-constructed tunes, and that may just be enough for even the toughest critics.\\" Similarly, Ryan Kearney of Pitchfork noted that \\"If hardcore Mark Olson-era Jayhawks' fans felt betrayed by the dark pop of 1997's Sound of Lies, they'll be downright vigilant after hearing Smile\\", but that the album, while not as \\"artistically successful\\" as Summerteeth, was nonetheless \\"one of the finer, genuinely happy albums of the year.\\" The Guardians Tom Cox hailed it as a \\"brilliant enough record ... written and delivered with the cynicism-free belief that rock'n'roll is still something vital and anthemic to the general public.\\" In a mixed review, the NME wrote that \\"as sweet as it often is on the surface, it seems like there's something deeply selfish underpinning The Jayhawks' new approach.\\" The Village Voices Robert Christgau wrote that the band, without Olson's contributions, were now \\"as vapid as late Poco and then some\\" and \\"aspire to the generalization level of transcendentalist parlor ballads, Hallmark cards, and, increasingly, Music Row.\\" Track listing # \\"Smile\\" (Gary Louris) ‚Äì 3:50 # \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\\" (Louris, Taylor Rhodes) ‚Äì 3:40 # \\"What Led Me to This Town\\" (Gary Louris, Marc Perlman, Karen Grotberg, Tim O'Reagan) ‚Äì 4:09 # \\"Somewhere in Ohio\\" (Perlman, Louris, O'Reagan, Bob Ezrin) ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"A Break in the Clouds\\" (Louris, Perlman, Grotberg, O'Reagan) ‚Äì 3:59 # \\"Queen of the World\\" (Louris, Ezrin) ‚Äì 2:35 # \\"Life Floats By\\" (Louris, Perlman) ‚Äì 4:42 # \\"Broken Harpoon\\" (Louris) ‚Äì 3:31 # \\"Pretty Thing\\" (Louris, Perlman) ‚Äì 4:18 # \\"Mr. Wilson\\" (Louris, O'Reagan) ‚Äì 4:26 # \\"(In My) Wildest Dreams\\" (Louris, Perlman, Ezrin) ‚Äì 4:30 # \\"Better Days\\" (Louris) ‚Äì 4:36 # \\"Baby, Baby, Baby\\" (Louris) ‚Äì 5:19 ;2014 expanded reissue bonus tracks # * \\"Who Made You King\\" (Louris, Perlman) ‚Äì 5:42 (studio outtake ‚Äì previously commercially unavailable) # \\"Gypsy in the Mood\\" (Louris) ‚Äì 1:16 (studio outtake) # \\"A Part of You\\" (Louris, O'Reagan) ‚Äì 3:14 (demo ‚Äì previously unreleased) # \\"Life's Little Ups and Downs\\" (Margaret Ann Rich) ‚Äì 4:47 (Live at First Avenue, Minneapolis, MN, 12/30/2000 ‚Äì previously unreleased) # \\"Greta Garbo (Louris) ‚Äì 3:50 (demo ‚Äì previously unreleased) # \\"Five Cornered Blues\\" (Louris, Mark Olson) ‚Äì 4:00 (demo ‚Äì previously unreleased) Personnel ;The Jayhawks *Gary Louris ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Karen Grotberg ‚Äì keyboards, vocals *Marc Perlman ‚Äì bass, mandolin, vocals *Tim O'Reagan ‚Äì drums, percussion, vocals *Kraig Johnson ‚Äì guitar ;Additional musicians *Bob Ezrin ‚Äì synthesizer, percussion, accordion, keyboards, vocals, string arrangements *Eric Heywood ‚Äì dobro, pedal steel guitar *Armadillo String Quartet ‚Äì strings *Patrick Seymour ‚Äì synthesizer ;Production *Bob Ezrin ‚Äì producer *Ed Ackerson ‚Äì programming, engineer *Leon Zervos ‚Äì mastering *Joseph Bishara ‚Äì programming *Richard Werbowenko ‚Äì programming *Jay Healy ‚Äì engineer, mixing *Ok Hee Kim ‚Äì assistant engineer *Jonathan Sacks ‚Äì orchestration, string arrangements *David Katzenstein ‚Äì cover photo *Ken Schles ‚Äì photography *Josh Cheuse ‚Äì art direction *Andy Wolf ‚Äì studio technician References External links *Flannigan, Eric.

The Integrated Test Range missile testing facility is located on the island. The island was originally named after English commandant Lieutenant Hugh Wheeler. On 4 September 2015, the island was renamed to honour the late Indian president, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. Geography Abdul Kalam Island is located in the Bay of Bengal approximately off the eastern coast of India and about south of Chandipur in Balasore district, Odisha. The island is about in length and in area. The nearest port is Dhamra Port. Integrated Test Range The Integrated Test Range, sometimes referred to as the Interim Test Range, is a missile testing facility composed of two complexes - Launch Complex-IV (LC-IV) located on Abdul Kalam Island and Launch Complex-III (LC- III) located at Chandipur. The India government began searching for a suitable location to construct a dedicated military missile test range and begin development of the Agni series of missiles in the early 1980s. The DRDO constructed an interim facility adjacent to the Proof and Experimental Establishment (PXE) at Chandipur. In 1986, the Union Government announced plans to construct a National Test Range at Baliapal in Balasore district, the same district as Chandipur. This would have required the government to move 130,000 people out of 130 villages located in the area. The Odisha government allotted Abdul Kalam Island to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1993, following A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's request for land to build a missile testing facility. Kalam referred to the island as his \\"Theatre of Action\\". In 1995, the Government abandoned the plan to move the test range from Chandipur to Baliapal, and instead built a new test site known as Launch Complex-IV at Wheeler Island. Abdul Kalam Island is the missile test facility for most missiles of India; Akash Missiles, Agni Missiles, Astra Missile, BrahMos, Nirbhay, Prahaar Missile, Prithvi Missiles, Shaurya Missile, Advanced Air Defence (AAD), Prithvi Air Defence and recently an ASAT missile Access to the test facility is by ship, as there is no bridge or airport connecting the island to the mainland. There is a small helipad, but missile airframes and all supplies, construction materials and heavy equipment arrive by ship. The maiden successful test fire of the Prithvi missile was conducted on Wheeler Island on 30 November 1993. At the time, Wheeler Island was uninhabited. Since the construction of the Integrated Test Range, entry to Abdul Kalam Island is restricted for the general public, and only DRDO personnel and Defence Ministry officials are permitted to travel to the island. Biodiversity Abdul Kalam Island is located close to the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary, the world's largest rookery of the endangered olive ridley sea turtle. Abdul Kalam Island's sandy beaches are a favoured nesting location for the turtles. The bright lights installed at the missile testing facility on the island caused some baby turtles to get lost as they were attracted towards the lights. Many baby turtles would fail to find their way to sea, and some died as a result. To protect the turtles, all lights at the facility are dimmed or masked during nesting season, and missile testing is restrained during the turtles' nesting and breeding season. In May 2013, increasing concern has been drawn to the change of the island's topography, owing to sand erosion. Since the island is technically a shoal, seawater frequently causes sand-shifting. The situation is being monitored by geological experts from National Institute of Ocean Technology and the DRDO.

Playing career Wall was born in Telkwa, British Columbia. He began his career by playing for the Prince George Cougars of the Western Hockey League. During his third season with the Cougars, he was moved to the new Everett Silvertips, where he finished his record-setting junior career. Following the 2004‚Äì05 WHL season, he was signed to a three-year entry level contract by the Anaheim Ducks on September 29, 2005. He began his professional career immediately, making his first professional start with the Ducks' AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates on October 8, 2005, and earning his first win on October 14 against the Providence Bruins. However, after he played in eight games with the Pirates, he was called up to the Ducks to back up Ilya Bryzgalov while Jean-S√©bastien Gigu√®re was injured. He then proceeded to finish his rookie season by splitting time with the Ducks' ECHL affiliate, the Augusta Lynx, as well as the Pirates. Wall began the season with the Pirates, but was called up for his first NHL start on November 26, 2006, as both Bryzgalov and Gigu√®re were injured at the same time. Wall picked up his first win that night against the Calgary Flames. He made four total appearances with the Ducks, including three starts, and on February 27, 2007, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche for Brad May at the trade deadline. The Avalanche then decided to move Wall to their CHL affiliate, the Arizona Sundogs where he scored a goal while playing with them which was just the 2nd goal by a goaltender in league history. Wall Spent the 2007‚Äì08 season with Colorado's AHL affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters in their inaugural season. Wall was a restricted free agent at the end of the season and was offered a contract by the Colorado Avalanche but turned it down. Wall now tends goal for his hometown Smithers Steelheads, a \\"AA\\" senior hockey club operating in the Central Interior Hockey League (CIHL).

It debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 51, selling 19,000 copies that week. History At the time of the recording, The Jayhawks consisted of the trio of Gary Louris and long-time members Marc Perlman and Tim O'Reagan. New guitarist Stephen McCarthy replaced guitarist Kraig Johnson. The initial release included a bonus CD of six songs, including a solo live performance by Louris of \\"Waiting For the Sun\\", the lead-off track of the group's 1992 album Hollywood Town Hall, on April 26, 2002 at The Woman's Club, Minneapolis, MN. Guests on the album included Bernie Leadon, Jakob Dylan and Matthew Sweet. Reception Rainy Day Music received generally positive reviews from critics. Dirty Linen described the album as \\"a low-key effort that features delicate harmonies, recalling California relatives such as Poco and the post-Gram Parsons Burrito Brothers\\". Uncut called the album \\"all acoustic guitars, rich jangling melodies and heavenly harmonies\\" and wrote that Gary Louris \\"has come up with some of his most memorable compositions.\\" Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly described it as \\"folk-rock laced with banjos, accordions, and pedal steel\\" and \\"the roots move one suspects fans have wanted for years, its classic rock flavor echoing the Byrds, CSNY, and Poco\\". Mojo wrote that \\"their new-found economy makes for some pretty lovely highpoints\\" and that \\"Louris is unquestionably a virtuoso, playing his parts with a decorous restraint, and contributing cooing, affectingly human vocals.\\" In his review for AllMusic, Zac Johnson, noting the return to roots music versus the band's more pop-oriented previous albums, praised the first six songs but felt that \\"the second half stumbles\\", concluding that \\"it's certainly an album that gets better with each listen, so it may yet prove to be worth its weight in acoustic gold.\\" Pitchfork reviewer Andrew Bryant agreed that the first half surpasses the second, stating that the latter songs \\"simply sound forced, pushing the combination of what constitutes alt-country and folk-rock to its limit of self-parody, and at times irreversibly crossing that line\\", calling the album \\"the sound of a dog (or more appropriately a bird) chasing its own tail, content with plugging away at the same formula as long as there's still precedence for satisfying their musical niche.\\" In 2009, Paste Magazine placed the album #44 on their \\"The 50 Best Albums of the Decade\\" list.

They are usually in a different order each time. However, they are not completely shuffled, so as to avoid varying the time between any two consecutive plays of a given song by either too much or too little. When measuring airplay, the number of times a song is played is counted as spins. Stations playing new music typically have a short rotation of around four hours, while stations playing \\"classics\\" may go as long as eight hours, with a few stations promising \\"no repeats\\" where a song is not played again during a broadcast day to allow a much broader playlist (or if there is a purposeful repeat on that type of station, it ties into a station contest for a prize, such as tickets to the played artist's concert). College radio and indie radio stations sometimes have no particular rotation, only the music director's suggested lists for the disc jockeys, or are totally freeform radio. Broadcast automation systems handle a limited rotation quite well, in turn making voice tracking easy. Even if a live person is present, the automation system at commercial stations usually picks the music ahead of time out of the current rotation, thus the DJ becomes only an announcer. Heavy rotation or power rotation is a list of songs that get the most airplay on a radio station. Songs in heavy rotation will be played many times in a 24-hour period. A reason for playing the same song more than once a day is that many listeners tune in expecting to hear their favorite song, and many listeners don't listen to the radio for extended periods of time. Prolonged listening to a station that places songs in heavy rotation can quickly become unpleasant; such stations are not well-suited for retail environments, where employees must listen for hours on end, and doing so can breed contempt for the music and create a hostile work environment.Psychologists: Christmas music bad for your health. Nexstar Media Group (November 7, 2017). Retrieved November 7, 2017. A song placed in \\"lunar rotation\\" is one that is only played in off-peak hours, usually late at night. There can be various reasons for this, but such songs are usually not hits and are played because of the personal musical preference of the DJ or programmer, to avoid more stringent daypart-based regulations on music content or to fulfill a broadcasting obligation to carry programming that is not popular with audiences, such as Canadian content quotas or public affairs. (See also \\"beaver hour\\".) Recurrent rotation Recurrent rotation refers to a group of songs still frequently aired on a contemporary hit radio station several months or even years after the initial debut. It is also used to describe core songs in other radio formats as well. Most charts have special rules to determine when a song has become recurrent, at which point they are removed from current charts (such as the Billboard Hot 100) and placed on special \\"recurrent charts\\". Recurrent charts tend to be more static, with fewer week-to-week changes in popularity than current charts. The Billboard charts include these lists: *Hot 100 Singles Recurrents *Hot 100 Recurrent Airplay *Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Recurrents *Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Recurrent Airplay *Top 40 Adult Recurrents *Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrents *Hot Country Recurrents Songs that survive in recurrent rotation typically form the basis of radio formats as years advance. A hit song that is left out of recurrent rotation will eventually become known as a \\"forgotten 45\\", a name derived from the fact that singles used to be released on 45 RPM records.

It is the largest festival of photography held in Asia. Chobi Mela X will take place in February 2019. The key organisers are Drik Picture Library and Pathshala (The South Asian Institute of Photography). Description The outreach programme consisted of mobile exhibitions which went to schools, playgrounds, market places. The exhibitions were accompanied by community liaison staff who explained the context of the show to viewers. Visits to the exhibition by school children and guided tours by curators were also arranged. An exhibition on the plight of Bangladeshi Jute workers was shown on the walls of the courtyard of \\"Kalpana Boarding\\" a low cost motel in Old Dhaka. These programmes have been extremely successful and the model has been replicated in far flung countries, such as Bolivia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. The opening of Chobi Mela V was on 30 January 2009 at the Bangladesh National Museum where the opening was through a show on Nelson Mandela and a remarkable video conference between Mahasweta Devi and Noam Chomsky talking about the festival theme \\"Freedom\\". Chobi Mela IV International festival of photography was held in Bangladesh from 9 November to 30 November 2006. The theme was \\"Boundaries\\". There were 49 exhibitions containing works by photographers from 23 countries. The show opened with a spectacular exhibition by Contact Press Images showing iconic images taken over the last thirty years. Held at a time when the country was at the brink of a civil war, this remarkable festival took place when most events in Bangladesh were being called off. Two major photographers Rashid Talukder of Bangladesh and Peter Magubane of South Africa were recognised with lifetime achievement awards.

Prior to entering the medical field in 1873, he studied philosophy and theology at the Universities of Leipzig, Jena and Marburg. After earning his medical doctorate in 1876, he enlisted in the army, attaining the rank of Oberstabsarzt (senior staff surgeon). After leaving the army, he returned to Leipzig, where he opened a private practice and worked as an assistant to neurologist Adolph Str√ºmpell (1853-1925) at the university policlinic. In 1883 he obtained his habilitation for neurology. He was a prolific writer and is well known for publications in the fields of neurophysiology and endocrinology. Among his writings in psychiatry were psychopathological studies of Goethe, Rousseau, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.Boston medical and surgical journal, Volume 156, Issue 1 by Massachusetts Medical Society, New England Surgical Society He was also an editor of Schmidt's Jahrb√ºcher der in- und ausl√§ndischen gesammten Medizin. M√∂bius made pioneer contributions towards the understanding of how some mental illnesses occur. He is credited for providing a distinction between exogenous and endogenous nerve disorders, and introduced ideas on the etiology of hysteria.  Medical terms  His name is associated with M√∂bius syndrome, a disease he identified as \\"nuclear atrophy\\". This is a rare type of palsy associated with paralysis of the cranial nerves VI and VII. This results in the patient having a masklike facial expression along with many other abnormalities such as drooling, crossed eyes, speech difficulties and problems swallowing. Other eponyms associated with M√∂bius are: * Leyden‚ÄìM√∂bius syndrome ‚Äì muscular dystrophy in the pelvic region; named along with neurologist Ernst Viktor von Leyden (1832‚Äì1910) * M√∂bius sign ‚Äì weakness of eye convergence; a situation when one eye converges and the other diverges when looking at the tip of one's nose, a condition associated with Graves's diseaseFree Dictionary M√∂bius sign M√∂bius postulated that hypersecretion of the thyroid was a link to goiters.Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Cell Physiology and Molecular Biophysics Front cover of \\"√úber den physiologischen Schwachsinn des Weibes\\" (9th edition, 1908)  Work  Today his most historically significant contribution to science is his work on the psychogenics of psychiatric and mental illnesses, such as hysteria. For the first time in the German-speaking world he postulated psychological causes of disease. For this reason and because of his convincing arguments for the therapeutical effects of electrotherapy, Sigmund Freud referred to M√∂bius as one of the fathers of psychotherapy. A further important contribution is to have given his friend, the psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926), important ideas to the differentiation and systematisation of mental illness. Moebius had only made one, on the causes of diseases based classification of nervous and mental diseases. Its subdivision in endogenous and exogenous errors has long been preserved and was leading the way for the psychiatry and neurology of the 20th century. Endogenous errors established in the nervous system itself, manifested as degeneration. In the long term M√∂bius thus paved to way for eugenics and the crimes of psychiatric and neurological disease in German Nazism. Also, M√∂bius syndrome bears his name, which he first described in 1888; and he pointed the way to understanding the cause of the endocrinological disorder Graves' disease. Moebius won a still dubious fame by his pamphlet \\"On the Physiological Idiocy of Women\\" (Halle: Marhold 1900). He received the greatest contemporary recognition for carving out his own territory with this work. The key message of the work not only postulated that \\"idiocy of woman\\", but also tried to impose this on already dubious methods. Moebius received plaudits for this piece, but also criticism, such as The Anti-feminists (1902) by Hedwig Dohm (1831-1919). In further response to Moebius were written Women and Intellectualism by Oda Olberg in 1903 and Feminism and Science by Johanna Elberskirchen in 1902. Elberskirchen said: \\"The truth is that when scholars make opinions concerning females, they are too much man (Mann) and too little or not at all scientifically reasoning human (Mensch).\\" (Elberskirchen 1902 p. 4) In other writings (such as Sex and Head Size) Moebius tried to support his theses but his comments actually showed his misunderstanding of brain anatomy and brain physiology. \\"On the Physiological Idiocy of Women\\" went through eight editions during his lifetime. In the later editions Moebius published letters from women and men which he had received for and against the book. These letters accounted for almost half of the book at the end. In the play Weiningers Nacht by Joshua Sobol, Moebius appears as a follower of the philosopher Otto Weininger (1880‚Äì1903), whom he accused of plagiarism.

The application typically (but not always) has a short life span, and is often created within the group where it is used, sometimes by the users themselves. As the requirements of a small team using the application change, the situational application often also continues to evolve to accommodate these changes. Although situational applications are specifically designed to embrace change, significant changes in requirements may lead to an abandonment of the situational application altogether ‚Äì in some cases it is just easier to develop a new one than to evolve the one in use. Characteristics Situational applications are developed fast, easy to use, uncomplicated, and serve a unique set of requirements. They have a narrow focus on a specific business problem, and they are written in a way where if the business problem changes rapidly, so can the situational application. This contrasts with more common enterprise applications, which are designed to address a large set of business problems, require meticulous planning, and impose a sometimes-slow and often-meticulous change process. Origination Clay Shirky in his essay entitled \\"Situated Software\\"Situated Software, Clay Shirky's Writings About the Internet described a type of software that \\"...is designed for use by a specific social group, rather than for a generic set of \\"users\\".\\" IBM later morphed the term into \\"situational applications\\". Evolution The successful large-scale implementation of a situational application environment in an organization requires a strategy, mindset, methodology and support structure quite different from traditional application development. This is now evolving as more companies learn how to best leverage the ideas behind situational applications. In addition, the advent of cloud-based application development and deployment platforms makes the implementation of a comprehensive situational application environment much more feasible. Examples A structured wiki that can host wiki applications lends itself to creation of situational applications. Some mashups can also be considered situational applications. A forms application such as a Microsoft Access Database (MDB file) can be considered a situational application. The latest implementations of situational application environments include Longjump, Force.com and WorkXpress.

It was designed to closely parallel the Pacific Crest Trail and the two trails cross 27 times as they pass through the states of Washington, Oregon, and California. The PCBT passes through the North Cascades National Park, Crater Lake National Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Yosemite National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Park and is generally routed through the Cascades and Sierra Nevada mountain ranges. The route attains its highest elevation at Tioga Pass in California at approximately 10,000 feet. Both paved and unpaved roads are used, although most are paved. In several sections where an unpaved road is used, a paved road alternative is offered. The route passes through terrain as varied as thick evergreen forests, apple orchards, wide river canyons, grasslands, glaciated high Sierra canyons, and high desert. The PCBT was first publicized by Bil Paul in his 1990 guidebook Pacific Crest Bicycle Trail, which is now out of print.  Route  According to a trip report by Caryl L. Bergeron, the route through most of Washington to Central Oregon included: * from Sedro- Woolley, Washington to Twisp on SR 20 * to Pateros on SR 153 * to Wenatchee on US 97 * to Ellensburg on US 2 and SR 821 (Canyon Road) * to Selah on Old Naches Heights Road * to Naches on US 12 * to Randle on US 12 * to Trout Lake on SR 131 and Forest Service Road 23 * to Hood River, Oregon on SR 141 * through Hood River on 2nd Street, Oak Avenue, 13th Street * to Parkdale on Route 281 * to Detroit on Route 35, U.S. Route 26, and Forest Service Road 42 * to Sisters on Oregon Route 22 The route was changed and field re-researched by Bil Paul in 2008 to use all paved roads (with one non-paved alternative in Oregon). However, more side roads are used. The Adventure Cycling Assn. of Missoula, Montana, published in April 2010 a series of five maps covering the revised route which they call the Sierra Cascades Bicycle Route Adventurecycling.org - sierra-cascades information page. A side route to Mount Rainier National Park has been added. The southern terminus of the route has been changed to Tecate, Mexico. At the northern terminus at Sumas, Washington, a connector route allows riding between Sumas and Bellingham, Washington, for an airport route to the Pacific Coast Bicycle Route.

Its local government area is the City of Whittlesea. At the , Wollert had a population of 9,060. History \\"Wollert\\" is a Woiwurrung word meaning \\"where possums abound\\", and the suburb takes its name from the land parish in which part of it is situated. From 1836 until the early 1850s, sheep raising was the main activity. In 1853, much of the land was subdivided into smaller farm lots, and necessary access roads laid out. During this period Wollert became a dairying community, with significant dairy production continuing for the Melbourne market until the 1960s. In more recent years, dairying has largely ceased and smaller-scale grazing and Wollert's quarrying and brickmaking facilities represent the suburb's main industries. The first school, established by the Church of England, commenced in 1852. A bluestone Government school replaced it in 1877 and continued until 1994. A Methodist Church was built in 1878 to replace an earlier one built in 1859. This church continued as the Wollert Uniting Church. The Wollert General Store is still in operation, but the adjacent Dance Palais is no longer is use. Wollert Post Office opened on 1 September 1876, closed in 1895, then reopened in 1902. During the late 1940s, several large Wollert properties were purchased by the Soldier Settlement Commission.

Not all drugs are subject to reverse tolerance. This is the opposite of drug tolerance, in which the effect or the subject's reaction decreases following its repeated use. The two notions are not incompatible, and tolerance may sometimes lead to reverse tolerance. For example, heavy drinkers initially develop tolerance to alcohol, requiring them to drink larger amounts to achieve a similar effect, but as excessive drinking can cause liver damage, this can then put this group at risk of intoxication when drinking even very small amounts of alcohol. Sensitization, a form of reverse tolerance, develops rapidly to the positive, euphoric effects of alcohol, but not to the physical effects, such as sedation and respiratory depression, which diminish with prolonged use. This sensitization does not occur, however, with administration of benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids, which only exhibit weakening of effect with repeated use. In some cases drug sensitization may also refer to medical interventions (e.g. a drug holiday) that have as objective the reduction of the insensitivity caused by (and after) drug tolerance has been established.

The memorial commemorates soldiers killed in the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan, with the sign containing a running total of the death count as recorded by the US Department of Defense. The monument began to raise controversy in November 2006. The hillside, overlooking State Route 24 and Lafayette BART station, was owned by 81-year-old Louise Clark, widow of Johnson Clark, until she died. Johnson Clark was a local developer and World War II veteran. The monument was erected in late 2006 by Jeffrey Heaton, a long-time anti-war protester, and Louise Clark. Their first 19 crosses were quickly removed by vandals. In November 2006 Heaton and Clark re-added the crosses onto Clark's property, this time with 300 crosses and a large sign that read: \\"In Memory of 2839 U.S. Troops Killed In Iraq\\". The sign has been defaced twice. It was first knocked down by a Marine sergeant, enraged by perceived antiwar bias. On another occasion, the sign was painted over with black tar. Both times the sign was returned to its original condition. The memorial, with its similarity to a graveyard, was constructed after the Clark's application to develop a large assisted living facility on the property was rejected as not meeting the zoning requirements for the residential area. By February 26, 2007, the number of crosses, mixed with Stars of David, Islamic crescents, and other religious symbols, had passed 2,500. Crosses have been added by volunteers and some paid for by the Lamorinda Peace Group and Grandmothers for Peace.

It is predominantly a new homes area. Austins Ferry is named after James Austin (1776‚Äì1831), who had been transported to Port Phillip as a convict in 1803 along with his cousin John Earl, and arrived in Van Diemens Land in 1804. After their sentences expired both men were given small land grants on the western shore of the River Derwent between Hobart and New Norfolk. In 1818 they established a ferry service across the river and later a punt which proved very conveniently located for vehicular traffic travelling between Hobart and regions to the north, and became very wealthy. In 1821 the visiting Governor Lachlan Macquarie renamed the village Roseneath, but it has since reverted to its original name. James Austin's original cottage (picture on the right) is preserved as a tourist attraction.

The genus was in 1977 named by Peter Wellnhofer who, unaware that the name Araripesaurus had been published by Price in 1971, presumed he was naming the first pterosaur genus from Brazil. The genus name refers to the Araripe Plateau and combines this with daktylos, Greek for \\"finger\\", a common element in pterosaur names since Pterodactylus. The type species is Araripedactylus dehmi; the specific name honours the German paleontologist Richard Dehm, a professor at the Munich institute that acquired the only known specimen in 1975. The holotype, BSP 1975 I 166, consists of a single phalanx, the first of the right wing finger, embedded in an elongated chalk nodule. When the nodule was split to reveal the fossil, its distal end was damaged. The exemplar is that of an adult individual. The phalanx has a length of 55 centimetres. Its bone walls are described by Wellnhofer as exceptionally thick for a pterosaur, measuring . Wellnhofer, because of the lack of further information, placed Araripedactylus in a general Pterodactyloidea. Alexander Kellner in 2000 assumed that in view of its provenance the species likely belonged to Ornithocheiroidea (sensu Kellner) and concluded that the phalanx was hard to distinguish from that of other large pterosaurs from the formation, such as Anhanguera or Tropeognathus. He could not confirm the exceptional thickness of the bone walls, nor any other autapomorphy of the genus. The wingspan of Araripedactylus was estimated by Wellnhofer as at least 4.8 meters (15.75 ft), and in another publication at 5 meters (16.5 ft).

The type species is A. castilhoi. Discovery and naming The genus was named in 1971 by Brazilian paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price. The type species is Araripesaurus castilhoi. The genus name refers to the Araripe Plateau. The specific name honors the collector Moacir Marques de Castilho, who in 1966 donated the chalk nodule containing the fossil. The holotype, DNPM (DGM 529-R), consists of a partial wing, including distal fragments of the radius and ulna, carpals, all metacarpals and several digits. The specimen was a subadult. Its wingspan was estimated at .R. L. Carroll. 1988. Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution 1-698 [A. Behrensmeyer/A. Behrensmeyer/M.

Later, other species were named from more complete remains and this raised the question whether they could be identical to Araripesaurus. In 1991 researcher Alexander Kellner concluded that Araripesaurus was identical to Santanadactylus and that due to a lack of distinguishing features it could only be more generally classified as a pterodactyloid. In 2000 Kellner reassessed the genus and concluded that precisely because of such a lack of autapomorphies (unique characters), it could not be synonymized with Santanadactylus and gave its position after a cladistic analysis as close to Anhangueridae, more derived than Istiodactylus. Kellner also indicated that Araripesaurus resembled Anhanguera piscator in morphology, albeit considerably smaller. Unwin, D. New pterosaurs from Brazil (1988). Nature 332, 398‚Äì399.

Biography John Day was born in Culpeper County, Virginia and came west through Kentucky to Spanish Upper Louisiana (now Missouri) by 1797. In late 1810, he was engaged as a hunter for the Pacific Fur Company and joined an overland expedition led by Wilson Price Hunt. The party traveled west from Missouri to Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia River in 1811‚Äì12. He is best known, along with Ramsay Crooks, for being robbed and stripped naked by Indians on the Columbia River near the mouth of the river that now bears his name in Eastern Oregon. After finally making their way to Fort Astoria in April, 1812, Day was assigned to accompany Robert Stuart back east to St. Louis in June 1812, but was left on the Lower Columbia River where he is said to have gone mad. He returned to Fort Astoria and spent the next eight years hunting and trapping mainly in the Willamette Valley and the inland northwest. John Day died February 16, 1820, at the winter camp of Donald MacKenzie's Snake Country Expedition in what is now the Little Lost River valley in Butte County, Idaho. His name is well-remembered, being attached to the John Day River and its four branches in eastern Oregon, as well as the cities of John Day and Dayville in Grant County, Oregon, and a smaller John Day River and unincorporated community in Clatsop County, Oregon, the John Day Dam on the Columbia River, and the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.

The rebellion was prompted by a conflict between Athens and Thasos over control of silver deposits on the Thracian mainland, which Thasos had traditionally mined. The rebellion was eventually crushed, after a long and difficult siege, but not before Sparta had secretly promised to invade Attica in support of the Thasians. The Spartans were prevented from making good on this promise only by an earthquake in Laconia, which triggered a helot rebellion. Thucydides cited the Thasian episode as one of the incidents during the pentecontaetia which marked the transformation of the Delian League into an Athenian empire. Modern scholars have also approached it as a telling indicator of the internal politics of Sparta, revealing the presence of a strong war party there during a time of peace and harmony between Athens and Sparta and foreshadowing the breakdown of relations which would result in the outbreak of the First Peloponnesian War by the end of the decade. Athens and Thasos Thucydides reports that the dispute between Athens and Thasos was caused by a dispute over control of markets on the Thracian and a gold mine that the Thasians controlled.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.100 Most scholars believe that Athens was the aggressor in this dispute, although G.E.M. de Ste. Croix has argued that the Athenians were intervening on behalf of a smaller state suffering under Thasian domination.de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 42-3 The mine and markets were profitable holdings, and losing them to the Athenians would have been a serious economic blow for Thasos; as this dispute was arising, Athens also dispatched a large group of settlers to found a colony called Ennea Hodoi (\\"the nine ways\\") at what would eventually become the site of Amphipolis. This colony, had it succeeded (it was overwhelmed by natives after a brief period), would have served as a base to project Athenian power and influence in a region where Thasos had long had interests.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 47 Thasos was a powerful naval state and a charter member of the Delian League, and rather than bow to these Athenian incursions the Thasians chose to resist militarily. War An initial battle resulted in an Athenian victory, and the city of Thasos was besieged.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War, 1.101 This siege would continue for over two years, during which the population of Thasos would endure severe hardships; an anecdote regarding a siege at Thasos during which anyone who proposed surrender to the Athenians was subject to the death penalty, and another regarding Thasian women cutting their hair to provide rope-making material during a desperate shortage both probably refer to this siege.Meiggs, Athenian Empire, 84 This determined Thasian resistance may have been in part a result of news of the Athenian setback at Ennea Hodoi, where the colonists, after early success, were defeated and driven off by local tribesmen (it is unclear whether only the military escort of 300 men or all 10,000 settlers were killed).Meiggs, Athenian Empire, 84-85 The Thasians were also hoping for delivery by outside intervention; they had appealed to Sparta for assistance, and had received a secret promise of support in the form of an invasion of Attica; this promise, however, was never carried out, as an earthquake in Laconia threw Sparta into disorder and triggered a helot revolt, which would occupy the Spartan army for a number of years. In 463 BC, therefore, the Thasians were at last forced to surrender. Significance and aftermath The Athenians imposed a harsh settlement on their defeated rivals. Thasos abandoned its claims to the disputed territories on the mainland, tore down its walls, gave up its fleet, and agreed to pay indemnities and tribute to Athens. At first that tribute was assessed at only 3 talents per year, but in the 440s BC it was increased to 30 talents; some scholars have viewed this increase as a sign that Thasos' mine and other holdings had been returned, others believe that it reflects a return to prosperity after the devastation of the war, and still others believe that the 3 talents was an abnormally low assessment, reflecting the burden of the indemnity the Thasians were paying, and that the increase merely represented an assessment based on the wealth of the island of Thasos itself.Meiggs, Athenian Empire, 85 The Spartan promise of intervention has been the subject of much analysis by scholars attempting to discern the inner workings of the Spartan state during this period, and modern scholars have cited the Thasos promise as evidence of a war party active at Sparta even during the period of accord between Athens and Sparta in the 470s and 460s BC;Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 77-8de Ste. Croix, Origins of the Peloponnesian War, 179 Although this war party was thwarted by the earthquake in this case, only a few years later anti-Athenian sentiment at Sparta would trigger the dismissal of Cimon with his army, which had been dispatched by the Athenians to assist in suppressing the helot rebellion, and the First Peloponnesian War would be afoot.de Ste.

It was a large animal, with a wingspan of . It was in 1994 named by Eberhard Frey and David Martill in honor of Arthur Conan Doyle, who featured large reptilian pterosaurs in his novel The Lost World, about a professor finding prehistoric animals still alive on a plateau in South-America. They first spelled the species name as Arthurdactylus conan-doylei, thus with a forbidden diacritic sign, and themselves carried out the necessary emendation to conandoylei in 1998. The holotype is SMNK 1132 PAL, a reasonably complete skeleton, lacking only a skull, neck, sternum and some caudal vertebrae. The specimen, adult or nearly so, was preserved on a plate and is slightly crushed. Arthurdactylus had, compared to the torso length of 22 centimetres, relatively long wings and especially long wing fingers, perhaps much more so than any other pterodactyloid. The hind limbs are however, weakly developed. The describers assigned Arthurdactylus to the Ornithocheiridae. According to Brazilian paleontologist Alexander Kellner, who uses this concept in a different sense, Arthurdactylus can be best indicated as closely related to the Anhangueridae.

White wine headaches have been less-commonly reported.  Sulfites  Many wines contain a warning label about sulfites, and some people believe that sulfites are the cause of RWH and other allergic and pseudoallergic reactions. However, this may not be the case.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 34 Workman Publishing 2001 Dried fruit and processed foods like lunch meat have more sulfites than red wine. Reactions to sulfites are not considered a \\"true allergy\\" and reactions more commonly occur in persons with asthma and may manifest themselves in difficulty breathing or skin reactions, rather than headache. Some wines may be exempt from including a sulfite warning. Wines that have under 10mg/l of sulfites do not need to be labeled that they contain sulfites. This includes added and natural sulfites, like sulfites that come from the soil, or those produced by yeasts during alcoholic fermentation. Wines labeled \\"100% Organic\\", \\"Organic\\", \\"Made With Organic Grapes\\", \\"Made With Organic and Non-Organic Grapes\\" or without organic certification may contain sulfites, and must disclose this on the label. This also means that the so called \\"Natural\\" wine can also contain sulfites. Different rules might apply in different continents.  Histamine  Histamine is present in a variety of fermented products such as wine, aged cheeses, and sauerkraut. Red wine has 20‚Äì200% more histamine than white wine, and those who react to it may be deficient in the enzyme diamine oxidase. Experts believe that in some individuals, alcohol consumption may lead to elevated plasma histamine levels even in the absence of histamines in the beverage consumed. A study of 16 people with an intolerance to red wine found no difference in reactions to low and high histamine wines. Other biogenic amines may also have an effect.  Prostaglandins  RWH could be caused by the release of prostaglandins which some people are not able to metabolize. Prostaglandins are substances that can contribute to pain and swelling. Ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin are prostaglandin inhibitors. Aspirin and ibuprofen were shown to be effective at blocking both early and late stages of the RWH, and paracetamol was effective in blocking the early stage.Kaufman and D.

Origins Hugh came from Morville in the Cotentin Peninsula, in northern France. His parentage is unclear.

Soon after, Hugh de Morville joined David's small military retinue in France. In 1113, following his marriage, Prince David was made Earl of Huntingdon and Northampton, and also became Prince of the Cumbrians, having forced his brother King Alexander I to hand over territory in southern ScotlandRichard Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, (Gloucestershire, 2004), pp. 59‚Äì63; A.A.M.

He was a principal player in the 1170 murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. He subsequently fell out of favour with King Henry II who in 1174 confiscated his Lordship of Westmorland (which he had inherited from his father who had received it from David I) and re-granted it to his sister, Maud de Morville, wife of William de Vieuxpont. *Richard de Morville, possibly the second son, who inherited his father's Scottish estates and lands in the Honour of Huntingdon. He also succeeded to the hereditary office of Constable of Scotland. *Simon de Moreville (d. 1167), another possible son.F. W.

The line runs from Buffalo, New York southeast to Rockville, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania along a former Pennsylvania Railroad line. Its north end is at Seneca Yard in Buffalo, with no direct access to the Lake Erie district, and its south end is at the Pittsburgh Line at Rockville. The line is operated by the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad between Buffalo and Machias, New York, the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad between Machias and Driftwood, Pennsylvania, and the Norfolk Southern Railway between Driftwood and Rockville.

It is named for the facts that: it resides in an Intron; it was isolated from Clamydomonas reinhardtii; it was the first (I) such gene isolated from C. reinhardtii. Its gene resides in a group I intron in the 23S ribosomal RNA gene of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast, and I-CreI is only expressed when its mRNA is spliced from the primary transcript of the 23S gene. I-CreI enzyme, which functions as a homodimer, recognizes a 22-nucleotide sequence of duplex DNA and cleaves one phosphodiester bond on each strand at specific positions. I-CreI is a member of the LAGLIDADG family of homing endonucleases, all of which have a conserved LAGLIDADG amino acid motif that contributes to their associative domains and active sites. When the I-CreI-containing intron encounters a 23S gene lacking the intron, I-CreI enzyme \\"homes\\" in on the \\"intron-minus\\" allele of 23S and effects its parent intron's insertion into the intron-minus allele. Introns with this behavior are called mobile introns. Because I-CreI provides for its own propagation while conferring no benefit on its host, it is an example of selfish DNA. Discovery I-CreI was first observed as an intervening sequence in the 23S rRNA gene of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome. The 23S gene is an RNA gene, meaning that its transcript is not translated into protein. As RNA, it forms part of the large subunit of the ribosome. An open reading frame coding for a 163-amino acid protein was found in this 23S intron, suggesting that a protein might facilitate the homing behavior of the mobile intron. Furthermore, the predicted protein had a LAGLIDADG motif, a conserved amino acid sequence that is present in other proteins coded for in group I mobile introns. A 1991 study established that the ORF codes for a DNA endonuclease, I-CreI, which selectively cuts a site corresponding to where the intron is spliced out of the 23S primary transcript. The study also showed that the intron was able to invade 23S alleles that did not already have it. Mechanism of propagation I-CreI has evolved to cut a 22-nucleotide sequence of DNA that occurs in alleles of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene that lack the I-CreI-containing intron. When such an \\"intron-minus\\" allele is cut, pathways of double-strand break repair are activated in the cell. The cell uses as a template for repair the 23S allele that yielded the responsible I-CreI enzyme, thus replicating the I-CreI-containing intron. The resulting \\"intron-plus\\" allele no longer contains an intact homing site for the I-CreI enzyme, and is therefore not cleaved. Since this intron provides for its own replication without conferring any benefit on its host, I-CreI is a form of selfish DNA. Structural studies and possible applications X-ray crystal structure of I-CreI bound to its native homing site. Because I-CreI has evolved to cut such a long sequence of DNA, unlike restriction endonucleases that typically cut four- or six-nucleotide sequences, it is capable of cutting a single site within a very large genome. A four- or six-nucleotide sequence is expected to occur many, many times in a genome of millions or billions of nucleotides simply by chance, whereas a 22-nucleotide sequence might occur only once (109/46 vs. 109/422). This specificity of I-CreI cleavage makes I-CreI a promising tool for gene targeting. If a person were to have a disease due to a defective allele of some gene, it would be helpful to be able to replace that allele with a functional one. If one could cause I-CreI to cut the DNA only in the defective allele while simultaneously providing a normal allele for the cell to use as a repair template, the patient's own homologous recombination machinery could insert the desired allele in place of the dysfunctional one. The specificity of I-CreI also allows for the reduction of deleterious effects due to double-strand breaks outside of the gene of interest. In order to use I-CreI as a tool in this fashion, it is necessary to make it recognize and cleave sequences of DNA different from its native homing site. An Escherichia coli genetic system for studying the relationship between I-CreI structure and its homing site specificity was created in 1997. In 1997, the structure of the I-CreI protein was determined, and in 1998, its crystal structure bound to its native DNA homing site was solved, greatly aiding research in altering the homing site recognition of the protein. Mutant forms of the protein have since been created that exhibit altered homing site specificity. A genetic system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has also been created, yielding additional I-CreI mutants with modified homing site specificities. I-CreI has already been used successfully to induce homologous recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, an extremely popular eukaryotic model organism. It seems very likely that advances in molecular biological techniques and generation of a library of I-CreI-derived novel endonucleases will eventually allow for the targeting of many genes of etiological significance.

Between 2006‚Äì2008 she held the distinction of being the largest ship ever to be registered in Estonia; a title later held by her replacement the sister ship Baltic Princess. Since July 2008, Galaxy has sailed on the Stockholm‚Äì√Öland‚ÄìTurku route under Tallink's Silja Line brand. She sails in pair with her sister ship Baltic Princess which replaced Silja Europa in February 2013. History The introduction of Tallink's first newbuilding, the cruiseferry Romantika, in 2002 on the cruise service between Tallinn and Helsinki was a success. One year after her entry into this service, Tallink's fiercest competitor Viking Line, announced that they would withdraw their flagship Cinderella from the same route, replacing her with the more freight- oriented Rosella. This led Tallink to order a bigger ship to replace the Romantika on 28 October 2004. Romatika, in turn, was needed to join her newly delivered sister ship, the Victoria I, on the Tallinn‚ÄìStockholm route. Design & construction Building of the new ship commenced in early 2005 and her keel was laid on 21 April. The shipyard was Aker Finnyards, Rauma. The Rauma shipyard had previously built the Romantika and the Victoria I. On 1 December 2005, the new ship was launched and christened as Galaxy. Designed as a carefully enlarged replica of the Romantika, the Galaxy is longer and has additional cabins and public areas. Leaving behind the external livery scheme introduced on the Romantika and her sister, the Galaxy sports a white hull with a cloud decorated blue superstructure, along with a number of different animals painted on her sides. The design of the livery was made by the Estonian artist Navitrolla. Galaxy arriving in Helsinki in Tallink colours, April 2007. Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn service After performing her trials, the Galaxy entered service on the Tallinn‚ÄìHelsinki route on 2 May 2006.

He served as Thomas Jefferson's private secretary when the latter was a peace commissioner in France, and remained in Europe to take on several other diplomatic posts. Jefferson, later the third President of the United States, was a lifelong mentor and friend. In a 1789 letter, Jefferson referred to Short as his \\"adoptive son.\\" Short was an early member and president (1778‚Äì1781) of Phi Beta Kappa at the College of William & Mary and was elected to Virginia's Executive Council from 1783 to 1784. After serving as the U.S.'s charg√© d'affaires in France during the French Revolution (1789‚Äì92). In 1792 he was appointed as America's Minister to the Netherlands, and from 1794 to 1795 he served as a treaty commissioner to Spain.The United States did not have ambassadors until 1893. Until that time, the highest ranking diplomats were known as ministers. Although his diplomatic career was not as celebrated or long as Short may have wished, and his love affair with a French noblewoman ended with her marrying another man, Short was a successful businessman and an opponent of slavery who died very wealthy in America. Life William Short was born in 1759 to William Short (the Fifth) and Elizabeth Skipwith at Spring Grove, Surry County, Virginia. He was the brother of Peyton Short, who became a land speculator and politician in Kentucky.Shackelford, p. 3 During his time in Paris as Thomas Jefferson's private secretary, William Short served as charge d'affaires in Jefferson's absence. Short's appointment to this role was President Washington's first appointment under the new Constitution, and thus Short holds the honor of being the first Presidential nominee in U.S. history.Nomination of a Sitting Member of Congress to be Ambassador to Vietnam, Op. O.L.C. 20 284, 287 (1996) After Jefferson returned to America in 1789, Short continued as charge d'affairs, and since he was the highest ranking American diplomat in France he essentially served as the replacement U.S. Minister for three years. During this time, in what would become a lifelong correspondence, Short provided Jefferson with detailed reports on the progress of the French Revolution. After 1792, Short became increasingly disillusioned with the excessive violence of the Revolution, which resulted in several friends being arrested or murdered. From September 1790 until August 1794, Short also acted as the United States's fiscal agent in Europe, and in that capacity he refinanced America's foreign debt, negotiating a lower interest rate than any other country enjoyed‚Äîa service that greatly helped America's federal government in the 1790s. He was appointed Minister Resident to the Netherlands in January 1792 and served until December 1792. From 1794 to 1795 he was a treaty commissioner plenipotentiary to Spain. Short's Spanish mission was frustrating, however, because France and Spain went to war in March 1793, making any Spanish-American treaty much more difficult. After working on negotiations for years, he was removed from his position just as the situation began to get better, and so did not get credit when a treaty was finally made. Short returned to Paris, but after finding that the woman he loved, the Duchesse Rosalie de la Rochefoucauld, was not willing to leave France, he went back to the United States to take care of business matters in 1802. Immediately upon returning, Short visited Jefferson for a month at Monticello, Jefferson's home. A few years later, then-President Jefferson nominated Short via recess appointment to become Minister to Russia in 1808; however, after Short had arrived in Europe, the Senate decided not to have a diplomat sent to Russia at all, and Short never proceeded to the post. Short became angry at James Madison, who had succeeded Jefferson to the presidency, for not renewing his appointment and for sending John Quincy Adams instead in 1809. Short also found out that Rosalie not only would not leave France to marry him, but had actually married an older, wealthy relative instead. Short left Europe for good, returning to America and spending the last years of his life managing his successful business dealings, supporting various philanthropic ventures, and keeping up his friendship with Jefferson through visits and letters. Short was both an opponent of slavery and a believer in the natural equality of the races. In 1798, he wrote that further research into the societies of Africa were giving evidence that black people were capable of great civilizations, and‚Äîhe hoped‚Äînews of this would undermine the racial prejudices many white people in America held toward black people. He advocated freeing slaves in America, giving them farmland and access to education, and supported racial intermarriage. Later in his life, he became a supporter of the American Colonization Society, believing that slaveowners would be encouraged by it to free their slaves. Love letters and romance with Rosalie de la Rochefoucauld Short never acquired the fame or political prestige he sought in life, despite his charm and intellect, his diplomatic assignments in Europe, or his close relationship with Thomas Jefferson, whom he considered a second father. But Short developed an extraordinary romance with Alexandrine Charlotte de Rohan-Chabot, casually known as Rosalie, the Duchess de la Rochefoucauld. She was passionate and beautiful, a woman of the aristocracy during the French Revolution. She witnessed firsthand the violence during the Reign of Terror, including the assassination of her husband and the execution of her brother. Their love affair was recorded in hundreds of letters which detailed these events, documenting the lovers' pains of separation and their frustration with social norms. Their words of devotion are poetic and moving, and offer personal insights into a turbulent era of world history.\\"William Short, Jefferson's Only \\"Son\\"\\" The North American Review, September 1926, pp. 471‚Äì486 Despite their romance, she eventually married a kinsman, Boniface Louis Andre, Marquis de Castellane, in 1810.Shackelford, p. 160 In popular culture In the historical novel America's First Daughter, Short is a major character.

It is a subsidiary of ONGC with its headquarters in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It has a 25% market-share in India among public sector undertakings (PSUs) coupled with a strong marketing infrastructure. Its parent company is ONGC which owns a 51.11% stake in the company. Navratna The company is ranked 367th on the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's biggest corporations as of 2016. HPCL was removed from NIFTY 50 INDEX in March 2019 On 24 October 2019, the company became a Maharatna PSU. History A view of HPCL from Yarada Hill, Visakhapatnam HPCL was incorporated in 1974 after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India Limited by the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act 1974. Caltex Oil Refining (India) Ltd. (CORIL) was taken over by the Government of India in 1976 and merged with HPCL in 1978 by the CORIL-HPCL Amalgamation Order, 1978. Kosan Gas Company was merged with HPCL in 1979 by the Kosangas Company Acquisition Act, 1979. In 2003, following a petition by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), the Supreme Court of India restrained the Central government from privatising Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum without the approval of Parliament. As counsel for the CPIL, Rajinder Sachar and Prashant Bhushan said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalised in the 1970s. As a result, the government would need a majority in both houses to push through any privatisation. HPCL has been steadily growing over the years. The refining capacity increased from 5.5 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 1984/85 to 14.80 million metric tonnes as of March 2013. On the financial front, the net income from sales/operations grew from 2687 crores in 1984‚Äì1985 to 2,06,529 crores in financial year 2012‚Äì2013. During FY 2013-14, its net profit was 1740 crores. Merger and Acquisition On 19 July 2017, the Government of India announced the acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. On 1 November 2017, the Union Cabinet approved ONGC for acquiring majority 51.11% stake in HPCL (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited). On 30 January 2018, Oil & Natural Gas Corporation acquired the entire 51.11% stake of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, thus becoming the promoter of the company. Although ONGC Holds 51.1% in the Company, HPCL denies to identify it as promoter. The reason given for it is that the majority of Board Of Directors are from Government of India and not ONGC.

Constructed between 1891 and 1893, it is considered one of the late Victorian era's finest shopping arcades and ranks among Melbourne's most popular tourist attractions. Designed by architects Twentyman & Askew, the Block is one of Melbourne's most richly decorated interior spaces, replete with mosaic tiled flooring, glass canopy, wrought iron and carved stone finishings. The arcade is L-shaped with an octagonal rotunda at the corner, connecting Collins Street at the south end to Elizabeth Street on the west. On the north side, the arcade connects to Block Place, a covered pedestrian lane that leads to Little Collins Street, opposite the Royal Arcade, Melbourne's oldest shopping arcade. The Block Arcade's six- storey external facades on both Collins and Elizabeth Streets are nearly identical, and are some of Australia's best surviving examples of Victorian architecture in the Mannerist style. The arcade takes its name from the practice of \\"doing the block\\": dressing fashionably and promenading the section of Collins Street between Elizabeth and Swanston streets. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. Name: \\"doing the block\\" An 1880 illustration by S. T. Gill shows Melburnians \\"doing the Block\\" By the late 1870s, the north end of Collins Street between Swanston and Elizabeth streets had become the favoured promenade of Melbourne's well-to-do, who went there to frequent its prestigious shops and cafes, and to see and be seen as they walked from one end to the other. This practice became known as \\"doing the block\\". Fergus Hume evocatively described \\"doing the block\\" in his novel The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, first published in Melbourne in 1886: History The site The Block Arcade forms an 'L' shape around Alston's Corner. On 1 June 1837, the first auctions of blocks in what is now the Melbourne CBD took place. The block now occupied by the Collins Street portion of the arcade was purchased by William Briscoe & Son. The Briscoes Bulk Grain Store occupied the site from 1856 to 1883, building a large new premises in 1877. In 1883, the building was sold to the George brothers' George & George Federal Emporium, established in 1880 a few doors up, who refurbished the interior for their expanding drapery business (which would eventually become Georges Store). Financier and landboomer Benjamin Fink was a director of the company, and by 1888 had plans to relocate the store and create an L shaped arcade in the area, and began buying up properties.  Construction  At 6:15 pm on Friday 13 September 1889, a huge fire gutted the Georges Emporium, causing over AU$400,00 worth of damage. The fire occurred at the height of the land boom of the 1880s, when Melbourne grew enormously and many large and elaborate hotels shops and office blocks rose in the city. The fire allowed the City Property & Co Pty Ltd (principle shareholder Benjamin Fink), to proceed with plans to create a sumptuous arcade on this central site, hiring architects Twentyman & Askew to design it, announced in January 1890, with the name 'The Block' revealed soon after. The Collins Street leg was built first, which was completed by late 1891, to little fanfare, with the grand opening of the whole arcade on 7 October 1893. The Collins Street leg has an angled kink because the site narrows part way up due to the presence of a narrow laneway on the west side. Originally known as Carpenters Lane, the City Propety Co successfully petitioned to roof it, creating a covered access from the Block Arcade to Little Collins Street. This in turn led to the development of shops in the lane, which was soon renamed Block Place. In 1902, Royal Arcade, which has been a dead end, was opened through to Little Collins Street creating a covered walk from Collins right through to Bourke Street. The design is often said to have been inspired by the 1870s Galleria Vittorio in Milan, which has a similar domed crossing, but on a much vaster scale.In 2003, the City of Melbourne signed a sister city agreement with the City of Milan, perhaps inspired by the connection between the Block Arcade and the Galleria. Ownership changes In the 1986, the arcade was purchased by the Time Corporation for AU$15 million. By 1991, Westpac took over the mortgage and sold the building to the Kearney family in 1993 at public auction. The Kearneys undertook extensive refurbishment, repairing the mosaic floors, repainting the interior in heritage colours, and renovating the office spaces above. In 2014, the Cohen family purchased the Block Arcade. The Cohen family have had long ties with Melbourne which date back to the 1840s, when Trevor Cohen's great great grandfather struck one of the first leases in Melbourne, for the ground floor of the nreaby 'Cashmore's Corner' on the northeast corner of Collins and Elizabeth Streets, and where his great grandmother was born. The Cohens are passionate about the precinct, and continue to maintain the Block Arcade to its former glory with an eye for detail. Block Court The building adjacent to the Block Arcade at 288-292 Collins Street was built in 1890 as the Athenaeum Club, and in 1930 the ground floor was converted into an arcade, designed by noted architect Harry Norris, one of the earliest and most elaborate Art Deco interiors in Melbourne. This arcade originally connected through to the Block Arcade with the removal of one of the shopfronts in the Elizabeth Street wing. At some point this building was bought by the owners of the Block Arcade, and they are still in the same ownership. In the 1990s, as part of the restoration of the Block Arcade, the shop was reinstated, and the north end of the Block Court arcade was closed off, and the shopfronts removed to create a large area shop. In 2016, the Block Court Arcade was partially restored, reinstating the shopfronts, but as counters for a branch of the Bendigo Bank, with access through the rear to a laneway and then into the Block Arcade. Notable shops The Tea Rooms opened in 1894, established by 'society girl' Miss Chrissie Robertson, 'daintily appointed' and intended for her society friends who did not wish to patronise ordinary tea rooms.Most online sources state that it was bought for ¬£18, opened concurrently with the opening of the Block Arcade in 1892, established by the Victorian Ladies' Work Association charity, and named in honour of Lady Hopetoun, wife of Lord Hopetoun, Victorian Governor (1889‚Äì1895). However that was a smaller tea room that was part of the societies rooms and activities, named after them, rather than Lady Hopetoun. Moving to the current rooms in 1907, it was redecorated in 1976 in Victorian style, with emerald and black wallpaper, and velvet ceiling hangings, designed by interior designer Murray Sheldrick. The Hopetoun Tea Rooms are sometimes confused with the tea room located in the rotunda of the Ladies Work Association, a charity for upper class women who had fallen on hard times, which operated from 1891-c1900, and whose patron was Lady Hopetoun. The Singer Sewing Machine Company moved into the shop on the eastern side of the Collins Street entrance in 1902, where it remained for many years. The shop was popular with female patrons, and sewing classes were run in the basement. Philip Goatcher, scenic artist, was commissioned to paint an elaborate mural on the ceiling, still in place. In the shop to the left of the Collins Street entrance, the Block Arcade also housed the first Kodak store in Melbourne, the camera company from Rochester, New York. Kodak allowed the average person to take photographs and promoted the arts of photography to the general public. The store sold parts, cameras, and equipment to both amateurs and professionals, and has an elaborate pressed metal ceiling.

It has smooth bark, serrated, elliptic to egg-shaped leaves, green to bluish flower buds, later yellow flowers in a cylindrical spike, and later still, up to one hundred narrow elliptical follicles in each spike, surrounded by the remains of the flowers. Description Banksia penicillata is a shrub that typically grows to a height of and has smooth bark but does not form a lignotuber. The leaves are arranged in whorls and are long and wide on a petiole long. The sides of the leaves are serrated or lobed and the lower surface is covered with woolly white hairs. The flower buds are green to bluish and are followed by yellow flowers in a cylindrical spike long with woolly-hairy involucral bracts long at the base of the spike. The perianth is long and the pistil long and slightly curved. Flowering occurs from March to June and up to one hundred elliptical follicles long and surrounded by the remains of the flowers, develop in each spike. Taxonomy and naming Banksia conferta was first formally described in 1981 by Alex George in the journal Nuytsia. In the same publication he described two varieties, conferta and penicillata. In 1996, George raised the variety penicillata to subspecies - B. conferta subsp. penicillata, at the same time creating the autonym B. conferta subsp. conferta. In the same year (1996), Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges raised subspecies penicillata to species status as B. penicillata in Australian Systematic Botany, and the change is accepted by the Australian Plant Census.

Evolution strategies (ES) are stochastic, derivative-free methods for numerical optimization of non-linear or non-convex continuous optimization problems. They belong to the class of evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation. An evolutionary algorithm is broadly based on the principle of biological evolution, namely the repeated interplay of variation (via recombination and mutation) and selection: in each generation (iteration) new individuals (candidate solutions, denoted as x) are generated by variation, usually in a stochastic way, of the current parental individuals. Then, some individuals are selected to become the parents in the next generation based on their fitness or objective function value f(x). Like this, over the generation sequence, individuals with better and better f-values are generated. In an evolution strategy, new candidate solutions are sampled according to a multivariate normal distribution in \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Recombination amounts to selecting a new mean value for the distribution. Mutation amounts to adding a random vector, a perturbation with zero mean. Pairwise dependencies between the variables in the distribution are represented by a covariance matrix. The covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) is a method to update the covariance matrix of this distribution. This is particularly useful if the function f is ill- conditioned. Adaptation of the covariance matrix amounts to learning a second order model of the underlying objective function similar to the approximation of the inverse Hessian matrix in the quasi-Newton method in classical optimization. In contrast to most classical methods, fewer assumptions on the nature of the underlying objective function are made. Only the ranking between candidate solutions is exploited for learning the sample distribution and neither derivatives nor even the function values themselves are required by the method.  Principles  Illustration of an actual optimization run with covariance matrix adaptation on a simple two-dimensional problem. The spherical optimization landscape is depicted with solid lines of equal f-values. The population (dots) is much larger than necessary, but clearly shows how the distribution of the population (dotted line) changes during the optimization. On this simple problem, the population concentrates over the global optimum within a few generations. Two main principles for the adaptation of parameters of the search distribution are exploited in the CMA- ES algorithm. First, a maximum-likelihood principle, based on the idea to increase the probability of successful candidate solutions and search steps. The mean of the distribution is updated such that the likelihood of previously successful candidate solutions is maximized. The covariance matrix of the distribution is updated (incrementally) such that the likelihood of previously successful search steps is increased. Both updates can be interpreted as a natural gradient descent. Also, in consequence, the CMA conducts an iterated principal components analysis of successful search steps while retaining all principal axes. Estimation of distribution algorithms and the Cross-Entropy Method are based on very similar ideas, but estimate (non-incrementally) the covariance matrix by maximizing the likelihood of successful solution points instead of successful search steps. Second, two paths of the time evolution of the distribution mean of the strategy are recorded, called search or evolution paths. These paths contain significant information about the correlation between consecutive steps. Specifically, if consecutive steps are taken in a similar direction, the evolution paths become long. The evolution paths are exploited in two ways. One path is used for the covariance matrix adaptation procedure in place of single successful search steps and facilitates a possibly much faster variance increase of favorable directions. The other path is used to conduct an additional step-size control. This step-size control aims to make consecutive movements of the distribution mean orthogonal in expectation. The step-size control effectively prevents premature convergence yet allowing fast convergence to an optimum.  Algorithm  In the following the most commonly used (Œº/Œºw, Œª)-CMA-ES is outlined, where in each iteration step a weighted combination of the Œº best out of Œª new candidate solutions is used to update the distribution parameters. The main loop consists of three main parts: 1) sampling of new solutions, 2) re-ordering of the sampled solutions based on their fitness, 3) update of the internal state variables based on the re-ordered samples. A pseudocode of the algorithm looks as follows. set \\\\lambda // number of samples per iteration, at least two, generally > 4 initialize m, \\\\sigma, C=I, p_\\\\sigma=0, p_c=0 // initialize state variables while not terminate do // iterate for i in \\\\\\\\{1\\\\ldots\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\} do // sample \\\\lambda new solutions and evaluate them x_i ={}sample_multivariate_normal(mean{}=m, covariance_matrix{}=\\\\sigma^2 C ) f_i = \\\\operatorname{fitness}(x_i) x_{1\\\\ldots\\\\lambda} <- x_{s(1)\\\\ldots s(\\\\lambda)} with s(i) = \\\\operatorname{argsort}(f_{1\\\\ldots\\\\lambda}, i) // sort solutions m' = m // we need later m - m' and x_i - m' m <- update_m(x_1, \\\\ldots ,x_\\\\lambda) // move mean to better solutions p_\\\\sigma <- update_ps(p_\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^{-1} C^{-1/2} (m - m')) // update isotropic evolution path p_c <- update_pc(p_c,\\\\sigma^{-1}(m - m'),\\\\|p_\\\\sigma\\\\|) // update anisotropic evolution path C <- update_C(C,p_c,(x_1 - m')/\\\\sigma,\\\\ldots ,(x_\\\\lambda - m')/\\\\sigma) // update covariance matrix \\\\sigma <- update_sigma(\\\\sigma,\\\\|p_\\\\sigma\\\\|) // update step-size using isotropic path length return m or x_1 The order of the five update assignments is relevant: m must be updated first, p_\\\\sigma and p_c must be updated before C, and \\\\sigma must be updated last. In the following, the update equations for the five state variables are specified. Given are the search space dimension n and the iteration step k. The five state variables are : m_k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n, the distribution mean and current favorite solution to the optimization problem, : \\\\sigma_k>0, the step-size, : C_k, a symmetric and positive-definite n\\\\times n covariance matrix with C_0 = I and : p_\\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n, p_c\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n, two evolution paths, initially set to the zero vector. The iteration starts with sampling \\\\lambda>1 candidate solutions x_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n from a multivariate normal distribution \\\\textstyle \\\\mathcal{N}(m_k,\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k), i.e. for i=1,\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda :: \\\\begin{align} x_i \\\\ &\\\\sim\\\\ \\\\mathcal{N}(m_k,\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k) \\\\\\\\\\\\&\\\\sim\\\\ m_k + \\\\sigma_k\\\\times\\\\mathcal{N}(0,C_k) \\\\end{align} The second line suggests the interpretation as perturbation (mutation) of the current favorite solution vector m_k (the distribution mean vector). The candidate solutions x_i are evaluated on the objective function f:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} to be minimized. Denoting the f-sorted candidate solutions as : \\\\\\\\{x_{i:\\\\lambda} \\\\mid i=1\\\\dots\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\} = \\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\mid i=1\\\\dots\\\\lambda\\\\\\\\} \\\\text{ and } f(x_{1:\\\\lambda})\\\\le\\\\dots\\\\le f(x_{\\\\mu:\\\\lambda})\\\\le f(x_{\\\\mu+1:\\\\lambda}) \\\\le \\\\cdots, the new mean value is computed as :: \\\\begin{align} m_{k+1} &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i\\\\, x_{i:\\\\lambda} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= m_k + \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i\\\\, (x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k) \\\\end{align} where the positive (recombination) weights w_1 \\\\ge w_2 \\\\ge \\\\dots \\\\ge w_\\\\mu > 0 sum to one. Typically, \\\\mu \\\\le \\\\lambda/2 and the weights are chosen such that \\\\textstyle \\\\mu_w := 1 / \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i^2 \\\\approx \\\\lambda/4. The only feedback used from the objective function here and in the following is an ordering of the sampled candidate solutions due to the indices i:\\\\lambda.

The covariance matrix update tends to increase the likelihood for p_c and for (x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k)/\\\\sigma_k to be sampled from \\\\mathcal{N}(0,C_{k+1}). This completes the iteration step. The number of candidate samples per iteration, \\\\lambda, is not determined a priori and can vary in a wide range. Smaller values, for example \\\\lambda=10, lead to more local search behavior. Larger values, for example \\\\lambda=10n with default value \\\\mu_w \\\\approx \\\\lambda/4, render the search more global. Sometimes the algorithm is repeatedly restarted with increasing \\\\lambda by a factor of two for each restart. Besides of setting \\\\lambda (or possibly \\\\mu instead, if for example \\\\lambda is predetermined by the number of available processors), the above introduced parameters are not specific to the given objective function and therefore not meant to be modified by the user.

More considerations on the update equations of CMA-ES are made in the following.  Variable metric  The CMA-ES implements a stochastic variable-metric method. In the very particular case of a convex-quadratic objective function :: f(x) = {\\\\textstyle\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x-x^*)^T H (x-x^*) the covariance matrix C_k adapts to the inverse of the Hessian matrix H, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations. More general, also on the function g \\\\circ f, where g is strictly increasing and therefore order preserving and f is convex-quadratic, the covariance matrix C_k adapts to H^{-1}, up to a scalar factor and small random fluctuations. Note that a generalized capability of evolution strategies to adapt a covariance matrix reflective of the inverse-Hessian has been proven for a static model relying on a quadratic approximation.  Maximum-likelihood updates  The update equations for mean and covariance matrix maximize a likelihood while resembling an expectation-maximization algorithm. The update of the mean vector m maximizes a log-likelihood, such that :: m_{k+1} = \\\\arg\\\\max_m \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i \\\\log p_\\\\mathcal{N}(x_{i:\\\\lambda} \\\\mid m) where :: \\\\log p_\\\\mathcal{N}(x) = \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\log\\\\det(2\\\\pi C) - \\\\frac{1}{2} (x-m)^T C^{-1} (x-m) denotes the log-likelihood of x from a multivariate normal distribution with mean m and any positive definite covariance matrix C. To see that m_{k+1} is independent of C remark first that this is the case for any diagonal matrix C, because the coordinate-wise maximizer is independent of a scaling factor. Then, rotation of the data points or choosing C non-diagonal are equivalent. The rank-\\\\mu update of the covariance matrix, that is, the right most summand in the update equation of C_k, maximizes a log-likelihood in that :: \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i \\\\frac{x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k}{\\\\sigma_k} \\\\left( \\\\frac{x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k}{\\\\sigma_k} \\\\right)^T = \\\\arg\\\\max_{C} \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\mu w_i \\\\log p_\\\\mathcal{N}\\\\left(\\\\left.\\\\frac{x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k}{\\\\sigma_k} \\\\rightC\\\\right) for \\\\mu\\\\ge n (otherwise C is singular, but substantially the same result holds for \\\\mu < n). Here, p_\\\\mathcal{N}(x C) denotes the likelihood of x from a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix C. Therefore, for c_1=0 and c_\\\\mu=1, C_{k+1} is the above maximum-likelihood estimator. See estimation of covariance matrices for details on the derivation.  Natural gradient descent in the space of sample distributions  Akimoto et al. and Glasmachers et al. discovered independently that the update of the distribution parameters resembles the descent in direction of a sampled natural gradient of the expected objective function value E f(x) (to be minimized), where the expectation is taken under the sample distribution. With the parameter setting of c_\\\\sigma=0 and c_1=0, i.e. without step-size control and rank-one update, CMA-ES can thus be viewed as an instantiation of Natural Evolution Strategies (NES). The natural gradient is independent of the parameterization of the distribution. Taken with respect to the parameters of the sample distribution , the gradient ofE f(x) can be expressed as :: \\\\begin{align} { abla}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} E(f(x) \\\\mid \\\\theta) &= abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^n}f(x) p(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^n}f(x) abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} p(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb R^n}f(x) p(x) abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}x \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname E(f(x) abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)) \\\\end{align} where p(x)=p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta) depends on the parameter vector \\\\theta. The so-called score function, abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta) = \\\\frac{ abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} p(x)}{p(x)} , indicates the relative sensitivity of w.r.t. , and the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution . The natural gradient of E f(x), complying with the Fisher information metric (an informational distance measure between probability distributions and the curvature of the relative entropy), now reads :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\operatorname E(f(x) \\\\mid \\\\theta) &= F^{-1}_\\\\theta abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\operatorname E(f(x) \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\end{align} where the Fisher information matrix F_\\\\theta is the expectation of the Hessian of and renders the expression independent of the chosen parameterization. Combining the previous equalities we get :: \\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\operatorname E(f(x) \\\\mid \\\\theta) &= F^{-1}_\\\\theta \\\\operatorname E(f(x) abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname E(f(x) F^{-1}_\\\\theta abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta)) \\\\end{align} A Monte Carlo approximation of the latter expectation takes the average over samples from :: \\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\widehat{E}_\\\\theta(f) := -\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\lambda \\\\overbrace{w_i}^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{preference weight}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!} \\\\underbrace{F^{-1}_\\\\theta abla_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} \\\\ln p(x_{i:\\\\lambda}\\\\mid \\\\theta)}_{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{candidate direction from }x_{i:\\\\lambda}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!} \\\\quad\\\\text{with } w_i = -f(x_{i:\\\\lambda})/\\\\lambda where the notation i:\\\\lambda from above is used and therefore w_i are monotonically decreasing in i. Ollivier et al. finally found a rigorous derivation for the more robust weights, w_i, as they are defined in the CMA-ES (weights are often zero for ). They are formulated as the consistent estimator for the CDF of f(X), X\\\\sim p(.|\\\\theta) at the point f(x_{i:\\\\lambda}), composed with a fixed monotonous decreased transformation w, that is, :: w_i = w\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathsf{rank}(f(x_{i:\\\\lambda})) - 1/2}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right) This makes the algorithm insensitive to the specific f-values. More concisely, using the CDF estimator of f instead of f itself let the algorithm only depend on the ranking of f-values but not on their underlying distribution. It renders the algorithm invariant to monotonous f-transformations. Let :: \\\\theta = [m_k^T \\\\operatorname{vec}(C_k)^T \\\\sigma_k]^T \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n+n^2+1} such that p(\\\\cdot\\\\mid\\\\theta) is the density of the multivariate normal distribution \\\\mathcal N(m_k,\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k). Then, we have an explicit expression for the inverse of the Fisher information matrix where \\\\sigma_k is fixed :: F^{-1}_{\\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\sigma_k} = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc}\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k&0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&2 C_k\\\\otimes C_k\\\\end{array}\\\\right] and for :: \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid\\\\theta) = \\\\ln p(x\\\\mid m_k,\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k) = -\\\\frac{1}{2}(x-m_k)^T \\\\sigma_k^{-2} C_k^{-1} (x-m_k) - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\ln\\\\det(2\\\\pi\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k) and, after some calculations, the updates in the CMA-ES turn out as :: \\\\begin{align} m_{k+1} &= m_k - \\\\underbrace{[\\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\widehat{E}_\\\\theta(f)]_{1,\\\\dots, n}}_{ \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\text{natural gradient for mean} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! } \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= m_k + \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\lambda w_i (x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k) \\\\end{align} and :: \\\\begin{align} C_{k+1} &= C_k + c_1(p_c p_c^T - C_k) \\\\- c_\\\\mu\\\\operatorname{mat}(\\\\overbrace{[\\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\widehat{E}_\\\\theta(f)]_{n+1,\\\\dots,n+n^2}}^{ \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! \\\\text{natural gradient for covariance matrix} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\! })\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= C_k + c_1(p_c p_c^T - C_k) \\\\+ c_\\\\mu \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\lambda w_i \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k}{\\\\sigma_k} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_{i:\\\\lambda} - m_k}{\\\\sigma_k}\\\\right)^T - C_k\\\\right) \\\\end{align} where mat forms the proper matrix from the respective natural gradient sub- vector. That means, setting c_1=c_\\\\sigma=0, the CMA-ES updates descend in direction of the approximation \\\\tilde{ abla} \\\\widehat{E}_\\\\theta(f) of the natural gradient while using different step-sizes (learning rates 1 and c_\\\\mu) for the orthogonal parameters m and C respectively. The most recent version of CMA-ES also use a different function w for m and C with negative values only for the latter (so-called active CMA).  Stationarity or unbiasedness  It is comparatively easy to see that the update equations of CMA-ES satisfy some stationarity conditions, in that they are essentially unbiased. Under neutral selection, where x_{i:\\\\lambda} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal N(m_k,\\\\sigma_k^2 C_k), we find that :: \\\\operatorname E(m_{k+1}\\\\mid m_k) = m_k and under some mild additional assumptions on the initial conditions :: \\\\operatorname E(\\\\log \\\\sigma_{k+1} \\\\mid \\\\sigma_k) = \\\\log \\\\sigma_k and with an additional minor correction in the covariance matrix update for the case where the indicator function evaluates to zero, we find :: \\\\operatorname E(C_{k+1} \\\\mid C_k) = C_k  Invariance  Invariance properties imply uniform performance on a class of objective functions. They have been argued to be an advantage, because they allow to generalize and predict the behavior of the algorithm and therefore strengthen the meaning of empirical results obtained on single functions. The following invariance properties have been established for CMA- ES. * Invariance under order-preserving transformations of the objective function value f, in that for any h:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} the behavior is identical on f:x\\\\mapsto g(h(x)) for all strictly increasing g:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}. This invariance is easy to verify, because only the f-ranking is used in the algorithm, which is invariant under the choice of g. * Scale-invariance, in that for any h:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} the behavior is independent of \\\\alpha>0 for the objective function f:x\\\\mapsto h(\\\\alpha x) given \\\\sigma_0\\\\propto1/\\\\alpha and m_0\\\\propto1/\\\\alpha. * Invariance under rotation of the search space in that for any h:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} and any z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n the behavior on f:x\\\\mapsto h(R x) is independent of the orthogonal matrix R, given m_0=R^{-1} z. More general, the algorithm is also invariant under general linear transformations R when additionally the initial covariance matrix is chosen as R^{-1}{R^{-1}}^T. Any serious parameter optimization method should be translation invariant, but most methods do not exhibit all the above described invariance properties. A prominent example with the same invariance properties is the Nelder‚ÄìMead method, where the initial simplex must be chosen respectively.  Convergence  Conceptual considerations like the scale-invariance property of the algorithm, the analysis of simpler evolution strategies, and overwhelming empirical evidence suggest that the algorithm converges on a large class of functions fast to the global optimum, denoted as x^*. On some functions, convergence occurs independently of the initial conditions with probability one. On some functions the probability is smaller than one and typically depends on the initial m_0 and \\\\sigma_0. Empirically, the fastest possible convergence rate in k for rank-based direct search methods can often be observed (depending on the context denoted as linear or log-linear or exponential convergence). Informally, we can write :: \\\\|m_k - x^*\\\\\\\\;\\\\approx\\\\; \\\\|m_0 - x^*\\\\\\\\times e^{-ck} for some c>0, and more rigorously :: \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\sum_{i=1}^k\\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\|m_i - x^*\\\\|}{\\\\|m_{i-1} - x^*\\\\|} \\\\;=\\\\; \\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\|m_k - x^*\\\\|}{\\\\|m_{0} - x^*\\\\|} \\\\;\\\\to\\\\; -c < 0 \\\\quad\\\\text{for } k\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\;, or similarly, :: \\\\operatorname E\\\\log\\\\frac{\\\\|m_k - x^*\\\\|}{\\\\|m_{k-1} - x^*\\\\|} \\\\;\\\\to\\\\; -c < 0 \\\\quad\\\\text{for } k\\\\to\\\\infty\\\\;. This means that on average the distance to the optimum decreases in each iteration by a \\"constant\\" factor, namely by \\\\exp(-c). The convergence rate c is roughly 0.1\\\\lambda/n, given \\\\lambda is not much larger than the dimension n. Even with optimal \\\\sigma and C, the convergence rate c cannot largely exceed 0.25\\\\lambda/n, given the above recombination weights w_i are all non-negative. The actual linear dependencies in \\\\lambda and n are remarkable and they are in both cases the best one can hope for in this kind of algorithm. Yet, a rigorous proof of convergence is missing. Interpretation as coordinate-system transformation Using a non-identity covariance matrix for the multivariate normal distribution in evolution strategies is equivalent to a coordinate system transformation of the solution vectors, mainly because the sampling equation : \\\\begin{align} x_i &\\\\sim\\\\ m_k + \\\\sigma_k\\\\times\\\\mathcal{N}(0,C_k) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\sim\\\\ m_k + \\\\sigma_k \\\\times C_k^{1/2}\\\\mathcal{N}(0,I) \\\\end{align} can be equivalently expressed in an \\"encoded space\\" as : \\\\underbrace{C_k^{-1/2}x_i}_{\\\\text{represented in the encode space} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!} \\\\sim\\\\ \\\\underbrace{C_k^{-1/2} m_k} {} + \\\\sigma_k \\\\times\\\\mathcal{N}(0,I) The covariance matrix defines a bijective transformation (encoding) for all solution vectors into a space, where the sampling takes place with identity covariance matrix. Because the update equations in the CMA-ES are invariant under linear coordinate system transformations, the CMA-ES can be re-written as an adaptive encoding procedure applied to a simple evolution strategy with identity covariance matrix. This adaptive encoding procedure is not confined to algorithms that sample from a multivariate normal distribution (like evolution strategies), but can in principle be applied to any iterative search method.  Performance in practice  In contrast to most other evolutionary algorithms, the CMA-ES is, from the user's perspective, quasi-parameter-free. The user has to choose an initial solution point, m_0\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^n, and the initial step-size, \\\\sigma_0>0. Optionally, the number of candidate samples Œª (population size) can be modified by the user in order to change the characteristic search behavior (see above) and termination conditions can or should be adjusted to the problem at hand. The CMA-ES has been empirically successful in hundreds of applications and is considered to be useful in particular on non-convex, non-separable, ill-conditioned, multi-modal or noisy objective functions. One survey of Black-Box optimizations found it outranked 31 other optimization algorithms, performing especially strong on \\"difficult functions\\" or larger dimensional search spaces. The search space dimension ranges typically between two and a few hundred. Assuming a black-box optimization scenario, where gradients are not available (or not useful) and function evaluations are the only considered cost of search, the CMA-ES method is likely to be outperformed by other methods in the following conditions: * on low-dimensional functions, say n < 5 , for example by the downhill simplex method or surrogate-based methods (like kriging with expected improvement); * on separable functions without or with only negligible dependencies between the design variables in particular in the case of multi-modality or large dimension, for example by differential evolution; * on (nearly) convex- quadratic functions with low or moderate condition number of the Hessian matrix, where BFGS or NEWUOA are typically ten times faster; * on functions that can already be solved with a comparatively small number of function evaluations, say no more than 10 n, where CMA-ES is often slower than, for example, NEWUOA or Multilevel Coordinate Search (MCS). On separable functions, the performance disadvantage is likely to be most significant in that CMA-ES might not be able to find at all comparable solutions. On the other hand, on non-separable functions that are ill-conditioned or rugged or can only be solved with more than 100 n function evaluations, the CMA-ES shows most often superior performance.  Variations and extensions  The (1+1)-CMA-ES generates only one candidate solution per iteration step which becomes the new distribution mean if it is better than the current mean. For c_c=1 the (1+1)-CMA-ES is a close variant of Gaussian adaptation. Some Natural Evolution Strategies are close variants of the CMA-ES with specific parameter settings. Natural Evolution Strategies do not utilize evolution paths (that means in CMA-ES setting c_c=c_\\\\sigma=1) and they formalize the update of variances and covariances on a Cholesky factor instead of a covariance matrix. The CMA-ES has also been extended to multiobjective optimization as MO-CMA-ES. Another remarkable extension has been the addition of a negative update of the covariance matrix with the so-called active CMA. Using the additional active CMA update is considered as the default variant nowadays.

He ruled Johor from 1528 to 1564. He founded the Johor Sultanate following the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese in 1511. He was the second son of Mahmud Shah of Malacca. Thus, Johor was a successor state of Malacca and Johor's sultans follow the numbering system of Malacca. Throughout his reign, he faced constant threats from the Portuguese as well as the emerging Aceh Sultanate.  Founding of Johor and Portuguese threats  In 1529, Alauddin Riayat founded his first capital in Hujung Tanah, known as Pekan Tua, 11 km upriver from Kota Tinggi, following the death of his father. A river fort, Kota Kara was also founded down the river. In 1535, about 400 Portuguese troops led by Est√™v√£o da Gama invaded Johor. Kota Kara was bombarded but the Malays withstood the attack. After a few days, Portuguese troops landed and bombarded the fort but they also had to retreat. Their morale boosted by this initial success, the Malays left their fort and launched a counter-attack on the Portuguese. However, the Malays were scattered by the crossfire of the Portuguese which resulted in the capturing of the fort and its burning by the Portuguese. Alauddin Riayat retreated upstream the Johor River to Sayong Pinang. His official, Seri Nara Diraja, died in Sayong Pinang. Alauddin Riayat returned to Pekan Tua after a short period and rebuilt it. Pekan Tua was attacked by 400 Portuguese troops under Est√™v√£o da Gama again because his brother, Paulo da Gama, and about 30 other Portuguese troops were killed by Malays. Following this attack, a peace treaty was signed between Johor and the Portuguese. In 1540, Alauddin Riayat Shah moved his capital to Johor Lama, which is closer to the estuary of Johor River.  Acehnese threats  Johor was also threatened by Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra. In 1539, Aru, Johor's vassal state on the east coast of Sumatra, was attacked by a fleet of 160 ships with 12,000 soldiers, being Acehnese, Malaccan Malays, Malabaris, Gujaratis, and Turkish. Alauddin Riayat gathered a fleet with aid from his allies, Perak and Siak, and attacked Aru in 1540. He reconquered Aru, leaving only 14 Acehnese ships afloat and thousands of Acehnese troops dead. The battle was called Battle of Sungai Paneh, which was the most glorious Malay victory since they were defeated in Malacca. In 1564, the sultan of Aceh, Alauddin al-Qahar, defeated Aru and expulsed the Johoreans from Aru. The sultan of Aceh, then, launched an attack on Johor Lama from Aru. The fort and town was leveled and Alauddin Riayat was captured and brought back to Aceh. He was later killed and was given the posthumous title, Marhum Syahid di Acheh. He was succeeded by his son, Muzaffar Shah II.  Personal life  He married Princess Kesuma Dewi of Pahang, the daughter of Mansur Shah of Pahang.

Trittschuh played a single game for the United States men's national soccer team at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in a 5‚Äì1 loss to Czechoslovakia. While the national team was thrashed, Trittschuh caught the attention of the Czechoslovakia's assistant coach, the head coach of Czech powerhouse club Sparta Prague. Sparta Prague offered Trittschuh a contract, which he accepted. At the time the Soviet Union and its eastern bloc allies, including Czechoslovakia were transitioning from communism to democracy. This brought an exceptional level of turmoil which also affected professional soccer in the region.

History Isaac Spiewak grew up in Warsaw, Poland and fled to America in 1903. It was there, in Brooklyn, NY, that he started a small family business, making sheepskin vests by hand and selling them on the docks of Williamsburg in 1904. By 1906, Isaac's vests were in sufficient demand around New York for him to establish a small manufacturing space in Brooklyn, calling it \\"House of the Golden Fleece\\". The moniker \\"Golden Fleece\\" was first branded in 1919. As his brothers entered into various facets of the outerwear business, the Spiewaks developed different, and sometimes competing, lines and companies to capitalize on prevailing trends and emerging market segments. Among the brands the Spiewaks created were Bronco Manufacturing, Ram Manufacturing, United Sheeplined Clothing Company, Spiewak Brothers, Swiss Blouse, Excalibur, Frost King, Pan-Jac, Trappings, Prince Jason, and Flight Deck USA. During World War I, Spiewak produced wool coats and breeches for the US Army and Navy, including pea coats, which are still made by the company today. During World War II, jackets and flight coats were produced for the US Military including styles such as B-9/B-11 parkas, A-1/A-2, B-10/B-15 flight jackets, B-3/D-1/D-3 flight suits, M-41/M-43 field jackets/N-1 deck jackets, N-2/N-3 snorkel parkas, and T-1 tanker jackets.

The vine produces high yields and ripens late, creating a wine that is deeply colored with a distinct, earthy flavor. Couderc noir is normally used for mass commercial and table wines.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 207 Mitchell Beazley 1986 The grape was planted throughout France following the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic in the late 19th century and until the 1970s there were more plantings of Couderc noir in France than Cabernet Sauvignon.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 275, Allen Lane 2012 Wein-Plus \\"Couderc noir\\" (Deutsch) Accessed: March 22nd, 2013 History and pedigree Up until the 1970s there were more plantings of Couderc noir in France than there was of Cabernet Sauvignon (pictured). Couderc noir is a natural inter-species crossing between an unknown Vitis vinifera variety and Munson (also known as Jaeger 70). The Munson grape itself is an inter-species hybrid created from two American grapevine species Vitis lincecumii and Vitis rupestris. Couderc noir was discovered in 1886 in the garden of a pastry chef named Contassot from Aubenas in the Ard√®che department. Contassot had plantings of Munson and when he observed the characteristics of this new vine, he gave the seeds to grape breeders Georges Couderc and Albert Seibel who began working with the variety. Couderc's \\"series 71\\" cutting of the vine was the most commercially successful and the grape was formally named after him. Like many French-American hybrids, Couderc noir was widely planted throughout France following the devastation of the phylloxera epidemic in the late 19th century. Its productiveness and disease resistance kept it in favor well into the 20th century even after advances in phylloxera-resistant rootstock grafting allowed traditional French vinifera to return in full force. By the end of the 1950s there were 65,770 acres (26,616 hectares) of Couderc noir planted throughout France, well more than Cabernet Sauvignon. In fact, it wasn't until the 1970s that years of vine pulling schemes by the French government reduced Couderc noir's numbers enough to allow Cabernet Sauvignon to surpass the hybrid in total plantings. Viticulture Couderc noir is known as a vigorous vine prone to producing high yields. It has a tendency to bud early and ripen late producing small, compact bunches that have a very low skin to juice ratio. The main viticultural hazard for the variety is its susceptibility to developing chlorosis which can inhibit chlorophyll production in the leaves and adversely impact photosynthesis. Wine regions In 2009, there were 529 acres (214 hectares) of Couderc noir growing in southern and southwestern France with its numbers steadily declining. Outside France there has been an uptick of interest in the variety in the American wine growing region of Missouri where botanist Hermann Jaeger, father of the Munson grape, did much of his grape breeding.Emma Wilson \\"Hermann Jaeger: An Unknown Legend in Old Europe Wine Country \\" KSMU Ozark Public Radio March 4th, 2011 In the Augusta AVA of Missouri it can have difficulties ripening in some vintages.Appellation America \\"Couderc noir\\" Accessed: March 22nd, 2013 In Brazil there is 1,231 acres (498 hectares) of a table grape variety known as Couderc but DNA testing has revealed to be a different grape variety. Styles Like many French- American hybrids, Couderc noir has a distinctive foxy non-Vinifera flavor that Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes can be \\"off-putting\\" to those more familiar with vinifera grapes. The grape has a tendency to produce deeply colored wines but can also be used to produce ros√©.

The Roosevelt Arch is a rusticated triumphal arch at the north entrance to Yellowstone National Park in Gardiner, Montana, United States. Constructed under the supervision of the US Army at Fort Yellowstone, its cornerstone was laid down by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1903. The top of the arch is inscribed with a quote from the Organic Act of 1872, the legislation which created Yellowstone, which reads: \\"For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People\\". The idea of the arch is attributed to Hiram Martin Chittenden, who felt that the area surrounding Gardiner was not sufficiently impressive and required an emphatic statement of arrival at the famous park. Before 1903, trains brought visitors to Cinnabar, Montana, which was a few miles northwest of Gardiner, Montana, where people would transfer onto horse- drawn coaches to enter the park. In 1903, the railway finally came to Gardiner. With the development of the Gardiner train station, the arch was proposed as part of the station ensemble.  Construction  The design of the Roosevelt Arch has been attributed to architect Robert Reamer, who designed the train depot, but documentation is inconclusive. Construction of the arch began on February 19, 1903, and was completed on August 15, 1903, at a cost of around $10,000. The archway was built at the north entrance, which was the first major entrance for Yellowstone. President Roosevelt was visiting Yellowstone during construction and was asked to place the cornerstone for the arch, which then took his name. The cornerstone that Roosevelt laid on April 24, 1903 covered a time capsule that contains a Bible, a picture of Roosevelt, local newspapers, and other items.McMillion, Scott. \\"Roosevelt Arch turns 100.\\" Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 24 April 2003. Several thousand people came to Gardiner for the dedication, including John F. Yancey, who subsequently caught a chill and died in Gardiner as a result. Description The arch is constructed of hexagonal blocks of columnar basalt, quarried locally. The arch is high. Two towers or buttresses flank the main archway, pierced by pedestrian passages with heavy wood doors.Whittlesey, Schullery, p. 7 The arch is flanked by curved walls of the same basalt stone, high, ending in short towers. The quote from the Organic Act is set above the arch in a rectangular slab of concrete. Similar panels flank the arch above the pedestrian doors, with \\"Yellowstone National Park\\" on the left and \\"Created by Act of Congress, March 1, 1872\\" on the right. Original ambitions for the design included a lake and waterfall, which could not be practically constructed in the semi-arid region and were never pursued. Instead, a small pond was built a little way in front of the arch, with unusual landscaping including sequoias from California. The pond and trees eventually disappeared.Whittlesey, Schullery, pp. 8-9, 17 The north entrance station was located just past the arch from 1921 until it was relocated a substantial distance to the south in 1961. The arch is listed as a contributing structure to the North Entrance Road Historic District, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the district in 2002.Whittlesey, Schullery, pp. 20-21  Notes  *  See also  *National Park Service *Rustic architecture * National Park Service video on Roosevelt Arch *List of post-Roman triumphal arches Category:Buildings and structures in Yellowstone National Park in Montana Category:Gates in the United States Category:Triumphal arches in the United States Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1903 Category:Buildings and structures in Park County, Montana Category:Tourist attractions in Park County, Montana Category:1903 establishments in Montana ","title":"Roosevelt Arch"},{"id":"8143298","text":"Couderc is a surname, and may refer to: * C√©line Couderc (born 1983), French female freestyle swimmer * Joseph-Antoine-Charles Couderc (1810‚Äì1875), French operatic tenor/baritone * Pierre Couderc (1896‚Äì1966), French screenwriter, actor, acrobat, and film producer * Raymond Couderc (born 1946), French politician * Th√©r√®se Couderc (1805‚Äì1885), co-founder of the Sisters of the Cenacle Category:Occitan-language surnames ","title":"Couderc"},{"id":"8143304","text":"George Peck may refer to: *George Peck, co-founder of Peck & Peck, a former New York-based retailer of private label women's wear prominent on Fifth Avenue *George Peck (artist) (born 1941), Hungarian visual artist *George Peck (clergyman) (1797‚Äì1876), clergyman, author, editor of the Methodist Episcopal Church *George Peck (Ontario politician) (1917‚Äì1993), Ontario provincial MPP *George Peck (theatre), principal founder of The Oxford School of Drama *George H.

Dino is an abridgement of Aldobrandino or Ildebrandino. He was born into a popolano or prosperous family of Florence, supporters of the white party of the Guelphs. Dino was active in Florentine politics serving as consul for the guild of traders, and later as member of the Signory twice, Prior, and Gonfalonier of Justice. He was democratic in feeling, and was a supporter of the new ordinances of Giano della Bella. Compagni advocates for peace between Guelphs and Ghibellines in a sermon in church of San Giovanni by Antonio Cuccinelli. From November 1301 onward, when the White faction lost the power of the Signory to the Black party, Dino was to never serve in a Government council. Because he had been a prior, his property was not forfeit; he was not sent into exile as other members of the White faction. When Charles of Valois, the nominee of Boniface VIII, was expected in Florence, Compagni, foreseeing the evils of civil discord, assembled a number of citizens in the church of San Giovanni, and tried to quiet their excited spirits. His Cronica (chronicle) relates the events that came under his own notice from 1280 to 1312. It bears the stamp of a strong subjectivity. The narrative is constantly personal. Compagni is more of a historian than a chronicler, because he looks for the reasons of events, and makes profound reflections on them. He is one of the important authorities for that period of Florentine history, notwithstanding the mistakes of fact which are to be found in his writings. During the 1870s, Karl von Hegel and Paul Scheffer-Boichorst participated in a debate about the authenticity of his chronicle, publishing several papers with their arguments. Hegel argued for the authenticity of Compagni's chronicle, and was right.Marion Kreis: Karl Hegel.

She was the first woman to work for herself in the industry, not her husband or another male shop owner. She worked in San Francisco and was tattooed by Ed Hardy in the 70's. She won the award for Best Tattooed Female in 1978 for his work. Later she was fortunate enough to meet Horiyoshi II at one of Lyle Tuttle's parties before returning in 1989 to open her studio in Seattle. She has advocated the use of tattoos to cover mastectomy scars as an aid to recovery. thumb Historical significance When she began tattooing, there were very few women who had tattoos, not to mention who were working as tattoo artists. When she opened her studio in 1979, there were only a few women tattooing on the west coast. She had a difficult time being treated as an equal in her craft and acquiring a full apprenticeship. Her work opened many doors for women in the tattoo industry, and is still seen as an example of a fine artist working in the tattoo medium. She was also a pioneer in the use of large-scale full-body tattoos in the West. Victoria Lautman has cited her as an artist who helped \\"to shift tattoos away from fashionable little rainbows, flowers, and unicorns to the larger, fine-arts-related custom designs.\\" She was also heavily tattooed at a time when it was unusual to see women with major tattoo work outside of sideshows. Asked about the public's perception of her full-sleeve tattoos, she said \\"I always felt strong and powerful about it, and I still do. But I try to keep my arms covered if I'm taking care of business -- I sorta wear a uniform according to what I'm doing. I want to get my business done quickly and easily, and I don't like having any hindrance or prejudice against me\\" (Vale and Juno 1989:125). In her words: thumb Current works thumb Lazonga has been featured in many magazines and books and currently writes columns for various tattoo magazines, including a regular column in Skin and Ink.Skin and Ink magazine She has also won numerous awards, including the artist's choice award at the 2005 National Tattoo Association convention.

During the adventure, Heinlein weaves in many explanations of problems, details and consequences of surviving on the moon under harsh lunar conditions, such as vacuum, temperature extremes, the extended lunar \\"day\\" and reduced gravity.  Plot summary  Bruce is an Eagle Scout from Colorado on his way to Venus with a three-week layover on the Moon. He hopes to qualify as an Eagle Scout (Luna) and then go on to become an Eagle Scout (Venus), the first triple Eagle. Shortly after his arrival on the Moon things get off to a rocky start when he gets a hard time from the troop he's assigned to, because nobody, not even the scoutmaster, believes he can make the grade. But quickly he is taken good care of by another scout, Sam, as the troop suits up for a hike. After some amount of bounding interrupted with a short section where they ski over powdery dust, the troop builds a pressurized shelter for some sleep. The next day they hike to Base Camp, which are some caves roughly but adequately furnished with an oxygen-producing hydroponic garden, solar panels, and sealed pressure. From here Sam and Bruce go on a two-person hike across rough terrain, up a cliff face and down another. Disaster strikes when the pitons break loose and Sam is injured in a fall. Bruce rigs a makeshift toboggan to haul Sam and they set out across the plain. A second catastrophe sees them falling into one of numerous dust-filled sinkholes, trapping them in a cavern. At first Sam loses hope, but Bruce is steadfast. After trying to find a way out through the cave and trying to shift the dustpile to expose the hole they fell through, nothing works. Their air is running out and as Bruce gets discouraged it is Sam's turn to bolster their courage. Bruce tries again to find a route out of the caverns and finally gets them onto the surface where they repeat \\"M'aidez\\" (Mayday) into their radio as their air fails and they are found by the troop. As Bruce is recuperating, the scoutmaster tells him that they will get him ready for the examination in two weeks time, whatever it takes.

Bruges on the Ferraris map Joseph Jean Fran√ßois, count de Ferraris (April 20, 1726 in Lun√©ville ‚Äì April 1, 1814 in Vienna) was an Austrian general and cartographer. He was married to the daughter of Charles, 2nd Duke d'Ursel. Biography Between 1771 and 1778, Ferraris was commissioned by the empress Maria Theresa of Austria and emperor Joseph II to create a detailed Carte-de-Cabinet of the Austrian Netherlands. The maps were made on a scale 1:11,520, and formed a collection of 275 hand-colored and hand-drawn maps 0,90 √ó 1,40 m each. These were accompanied by twelve volumes of handwritten commentaries relating to topics of economic and military interest (rivers, bridges, forests, possibilities for military camps, etc). Ferraris Map Three originals of the maps remain. One is in the Kriegsarchiv in Vienna, one is in the Rijksarchief in The Hague and the third one remains in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels. The maps held in Brussels were the maps destined for Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, the Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, and were transferred to Belgium by Austria in 1922 as part of the World War I reparations. In 1777 and 1778, Ferraris issued a reduced version of the cabinet maps with a scale of 1:86,400 in 25 maps, issued for commercial sale (\\"carte marchande\\"). The Ferraris maps were used to great extent during the military operations of the French Revolutionary Wars and during the Napoleonic Wars. When the French invaded in 1792‚Äì1793 they took 400 copies of the map from a Brussel's printer and seller. In 1794 they took the engraving plates to France so they could produce more maps for their own use and to prevent any enemy from acquiring copies. Louis Capitaine, a French engineer, copied it and produced 2 versions one with 69 sheets and a smaller scale version on six sheets, which was sold commercially. During the Waterloo Campaign the Duke of Wellington had a copy of the six sheet version as it is probable that Prince Blucher also had a copy of the six sheet version. Napoleon carried a copy of the full scale Capitaine map while Gourgaud, an aide-de-camp to Napoleon, carried a copy of the Farraris map. Both versions were very similar and about 40 years out of date (for instance coal mines with their supporting infrastructure which had developed around Charleroi in the interval between the map's drafting and 1815 were missing). Trivia * The Brussels-based Flemish government building, housing parts of the Flemish ministry of Environment, Nature and Energy and the Flemish Ministry of Mobility and Public Works is named Graaf de Ferrarisgebouw after him.

Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread out of control due to drought conditions and increasing winds, combining into one large conflagration which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park closed to all non-emergency personnel for the first time in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of , or 36 percent of the park, was affected by the wildfires. Thousands of firefighters fought the fires, assisted by dozens of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft which were used for water and fire retardant drops. At the peak of the effort, more than 9,000 firefighters were assigned to the park. With fires raging throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and other areas in the western United States, the staffing levels of the National Park Service and other land management agencies were inadequate for the situation; more than 4,000 U.S. military personnel were soon brought in to assist in wildfire suppression efforts. The firefighting effort cost $120 million ($ in ). Losses to structures were minimized by concentrating firefighting efforts near major visitor areas, keeping property damage down to $3 million ($ as of ). No firefighters died while fighting the Yellowstone fires, though there were two fire-related deaths outside the park. Before the late 1960s, fires were generally believed to be detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires. In contrast, in 1988, Yellowstone was overdue for a large fire, and, in the exceptionally dry summer, many smaller \\"controlled\\" fires combined. The fires burned discontinuously, leaping from one patch to another, leaving intervening areas untouched. Intense fires swept through some regions, burning everything in their paths. Tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by the wildfires, and some regions were left looking blackened and dead. However, more than half of the affected areas were burned by ground fires, which did less damage to hardier tree species. Not long after the fires ended, plant and tree species quickly reestablished themselves, and native plant regeneration has been highly successful. The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were unprecedented in the history of the National Park Service, and led to many questions about existing fire management policies. Media accounts of mismanagement were often sensational and inaccurate, sometimes wrongly reporting or implying that most of the park was being destroyed. While there were temporary declines in air quality during the fires, no adverse long-term health effects have been recorded in the ecosystem and, contrary to initial reports, few large mammals were killed by the fires, though there was a subsequent reduction in the number of moose which has yet to rebound. Fire management policy development in the United States 1953: a firefighter hikes to a distant fire In the eastern United States, with its significant rainfall, wildfires are relatively small and have rarely posed great risk to life and property. As white settlements moved further west into drier areas, the first large scale fires were encountered. Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever been seen in the east. A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies. The worst loss of life in United States history due to a wildfire occurred in 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1,500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger that needed to be suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities, and killed 86 people; this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands. Before the middle of the 20th century, most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times. By 1935, the U.S. Forest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 a.m. the morning after they were first spotted. Firefighting crews were established throughout public lands, and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. By 1940, firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. By the beginning of World War II, more than 8,000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States. Though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, three are still used each year in Yellowstone. Firefighting efforts were highly successful, with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of during the 1930s, to between and by the 1960s. The need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. In 1944, the U.S. Forest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental, using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear. This iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase \\"Only you can prevent forest fires\\". Early posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused. In Yellowstone, human-caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually, while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning. However, some researchers in the 20th century argued that this policy should be changed, on the grounds that wildfires in national parks help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn. From 1972, the National Park Service began allowing natural fires in Yellowstone to burn under controlled conditions. Fires of this type were referred to as prescribed natural fires. Between 1972 and 1987, a total of 235 prescribed natural fires burned a relatively small under the directives of the new policy. Of these, only 15 spread to more than . The five years prior to 1988 were much wetter than normal and this may have reduced the area of the fires during that period. The prescribed natural fire policy appeared to be an effective way to manage fires, especially in the Yellowstone region. Contributing factors to the fires 1965: typical Yellowstone lodgepole pine forest Formal fire record- keeping in Yellowstone began in 1931, when the Heart Lake Fire burned . Despite its small extent, it was the largest fire in the period from when the park was created until 1988. Research indicates that only two or three large fires occur on the Yellowstone Plateau every 1,000 years. The previous major Yellowstone fire was in the early to mid-18th century, well before the arrival of white explorers. Yellowstone forests are dominated by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100 years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s, much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250 years old and approaching the end of their life-cycle. The mountain pine beetle killed a number of trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages. This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels that contributed to the fires. In addition, the winter season of 1987‚Äì1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack. However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder. Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires. Accumulated fuel, old forests, and unabated and exceptionally dry conditions spelled trouble for Yellowstone. However, foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire season for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for July. History provided little evidence to suggest that 1988 would be any different from the previous 100 plus years the park had existed. But, as major fires started to break out throughout the Rocky Mountain region, the media began to take notice. Twenty small fires started in Yellowstone by July and of those, eleven went out on their own. The remainder were closely monitored in accordance with the prescribed natural fire policies. By July 15, fires throughout the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned and though this was not out of the ordinary, media focus on fires raging throughout the American west influenced the decision by the park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on July 15. Within a week after suppression efforts commenced, the fires had spread to include almost on the parkland alone. Major fires in Yellowstone in 1988 Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\", more than were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6 km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of a day, and there were even occasions when more than in one hour were recorded. One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20. The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19, and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In the midst of a large lodgepole pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger. The Mink fire started in Bridger- Teton National Forest from lightning on July 11, and burned north following the Yellowstone River valley, after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands. The Mink fire eventually burned sections inside the park after July 23, but was deemed to be a low risk since it was in a very remote section of the park. The third largest fire was the Huck fire, which started after a tree fell on a power line on August 20 near Flagg Ranch. This fire burned primarily in the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, crossing Yellowstone's southern border on August 30. The Snake River Complex of fires burned more than before they were extinguished by wet weather in the fall. One of the most striking events of this fire complex occurred on August 23 when intense fires swept across the Lewis River Canyon, propelled by winds of and gusting to . The Mist fire started on July 9, in the eastern section of the park in the Absaroka Mountains. Two days later, the Clover fire started in the same region and both fires combined and were renamed as the Clover Mist fire on July 20. Burning in rugged terrain, this fire was very difficult to fight and on August 20, the fire advanced from the south towards the small town of Cooke City, Montana and continued to threaten the town for several more weeks. The Clover Mist fire eventually consumed more than . The Storm Creek fire started on June 14, well north of the park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also threatening the town of Cooke City, this time from the north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6. The other major fire located in the northern section of the park was the Hellroaring fire. Started in Gallatin National Forest on August 15 from embers from an unattended campfire, the fire initially moved north, but then turned around a few days later and moved south, threatening the area near Tower Junction. In the northwest, the Fan fire started on June 25, and was originally considered a threat to the town of Gardiner, Montana, just outside the park's north entrance. It was the most successfully fought of all the 1988 fires. Though the fire was not contained for a couple of months, by mid-August, it was no longer considered a threat to lives and property. The largest fire in the park was the North Fork fire, both in terms of damage to structures and of area burned. The fire started on July 22, when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border. The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast and by the end of the first week of August, was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau, and on August 25, reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley. Between September 5 and 7, a dry front pushed flames along the southern section of the North Fork fire towards the large Old Faithful visitor complex adjacent to the Upper Geyser Basin. All non-emergency personnel were ordered to be evacuated; however, political issues influenced National Park Service management directives and the complex was not completely closed to incoming tourists, with some visitors still arriving at Old Faithful not long before the intense fire hit by mid afternoon. An all out aerial bombardment with air tankers dropping fire retardant failed. Firefighters concentrated on structure protection, especially those of historical significance such as the Old Faithful Inn, using fire engines and portable water pumping systems to keep the roofs and other surfaces of the structures wet. 1,200 firefighters including 120 military personnel dug fire lines and cleared away brush near structures. Winds crested up to as the fire approached from the west. The fires spread to forested sections near to, but generally away from major structures, but 19 small structures were destroyed and there was also extensive damage to an old dormitory. The fire was so intense that vehicles left near the fire had their wheels melted, windshields shattered and paint scorched. Though most of the Old Faithful complex had been spared, the park service decided that for the first time, the entire park would be closed to non-emergency personnel on September 8. The night of the 9th and the morning of September 10, the North Fork fire jumped a fireline along its northeastern flank and approached Mammoth Hot Springs where a large concentration of historical structures as well as the Park Headquarters is located. Rain and snow arrived in time to slow the fires before they threatened the complex. By the time the North Fork fire finally died down, it was responsible for 60% of the burned area within the park; more than . Colder weather, bringing with it rain and snow on September 11, calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn well into the middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out. Fighting the fires fireline near Mammoth Hot Springs, September 10, 1988 1988 was a big year for wildfires in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major. Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, more than 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At the height of the fires, more than 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, and by the time the fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for two to three weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14 hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area. Firefighters created of fireline by hand and with mechanized equipment such as bulldozers. Most of the bulldozer work was done on the North Fork fire. Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment, and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features. Additionally, the thin, unstable ground near the park's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment. Bulldozers are rarely used on fires in U.S. National Parks. Some 120 helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft were used to combat the inferno. Aircraft logged more than 18,000 hours of flight time and dropped of fire retardant and of water on the fires. More than 100 fire engines were assigned to the fire. Structural fire engines were used in building complexes, where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings. Smaller wildland fire engines suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout the park. $120 million was spent fighting the fires, while structural losses were estimated at $3 million. Later analysis has shown that, aside from concentrated fire suppression efforts near major tourist facilities, the firefighting work failed to stop what was likely an unstoppable force.2014 N.W.T. fire season report: What you need to know Impacts on the park Vegetation and wildlife snags still stand almost 20 years after the fires, but lodgepole pines are thriving in the understory. The year after the fires, and for a number of years afterwards, wildflowers were abundant in burned areas. A bull elk in a recently burned area The fires in Yellowstone left a mosaic of areas greatly affected and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown fires accounted for about 41 percent of all the area that burned. Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned one or the other as they spread through the forest. Ground fires spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned. The recovery from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing in a matter of days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately re-assume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and five years after the fires. Seeds had little distance to travel, even in severely burned areas. Much of the most badly burned forest was within of less affected areas. Still, most regeneration of the plants and trees came from immediate sources, either above or below ground. Lodgepole pines generally do not disperse their seeds more than , so seed dispersal from less burned parts apparently had little effect on more severely burned areas. In regions that did experience complete burnouts, the average depth of charred soil was only about half an inch (14 mm), so few roots, even of grasses, were killed by the fire. This allowed rapid regeneration throughout the ecosystem. The predominant tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from the fires, except in areas where the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5 years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife. Aspen became more widespread after the fires, occupying areas that had been dominated by conifers. It had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal. However, aspen sprouts appeared two years after the fires as far as from the nearest known aspen trees. Aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk and many of the newer aspen are consequently small, except in areas that are harder for elk to get to. The resurgence of aspen after the fires was a contrast to pre-fire events, as aspen had been increasingly scarce in the park. This might be a temporary event as conifers continue to grow and eventually crowd out other tree species. Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time, the fires killed very few park animals‚Äî surveys indicated that only about 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000‚Äì50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the fires happened, only one was believed to have been lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the fires. Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose are more likely to be browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the fires. All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires, but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them. Approximately 100 dead fish were reported in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them. Aside from a temporary decrease in a few species of aquatic insects, no long- term impact has been observed on aquatic life in any of Yellowstone's rivers or lakes.

The smoke and airborne particulates from the fires posed a threat to local communities on several occasions. Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, the location of the park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas. In the aftermath of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989. Structure damage Firefighters sprayed foam on structures in the Mammoth Hot Springs complex on September 10, 1988. The park service gave priority to life and property in their efforts to suppress the fires. Of the more than 1,000 structures located in the park, only 67 were destroyed. There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed, 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace. Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment, especially at times of immediate danger. Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes, yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non- critical personnel at least once during the fires. Of the 38 backcountry patrol cabins used by park rangers and park staff, the only one lost to the fires was at Sportsman Lake, and it was rebuilt the following summer. However, fires did a lot of damage to numerous campgrounds, backcountry bridges, and of power lines and 300 utility poles. Some of the boardwalks used to keep tourists elevated above geothermal areas were also destroyed, but were quickly replaced. Media coverage News crews were required to wear Nomex firefighting clothing whenever they were near fires. Since Yellowstone is one of the most famous national parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of more than 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency. Lack of understanding of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression that most of the park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires‚Äîa mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, due to a lack of fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies. Fire management since 1988 As a result of research conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, as well as all human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance. Increased fire monitoring through ground-based and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first determine whether a fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning and the amount of fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions. Land management employees remove dead and hazardous fuels from areas as prioritized by the Hazard Fuels Reduction Plan. This is to ensure fires have less opportunity to threaten lives, historical structures, and visitor facilities. As of 2007, fuel is reduced within 400 feet (120 m) of structures and other high-priority locations. Foresters and ecologists argue that large controlled burns in Yellowstone prior to the fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if they were allowed to burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed. Greater cooperation between federal and state agencies on a national level has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts. The most important lesson learned is that a number of ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires. This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home. While large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities, they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, if it is to be maintained in a natural manner.

Maher made his first appearance for the team during the 1968‚Äì69 National League and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1975 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, four Munster medals, three National League medals and two All-Star awards. Maher was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. At club level Maher is a two-time All-Ireland medalist with St. Finbarr's. In addition to this he has also won four Munster medals and seven county club championship medals. Playing career Club Maher played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's in a club career that spanned three decades. He made his senior debut just out of the minor ranks in 1964 and became a regular at corner-forward. After losing the championship decider to Glen Rovers that year, \\"the Barr's\\" were back for a second successive final the following year. University College Cork provided the opposition, with St. Finbarr's winning to a 6‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì6 scoreline. It was Maher's first championship medal. A subsequent 3‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì3 win over Waterford's Mount Sion gave him a Munster medal. After surrendering their titles the following year and losing the final to Glen Rovers in 1967, St. Finbarr's bounced back in 1968. Maher collected a second championship medal following a narrow 5‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì19 defeat of Imokilly. After an absence of six years St. Finbarr's returned to the top table of Cork hurling once again in 1974. In spite of being regarded as underdogs against Blackrock, Con Roche helped \\"the Barr's\\" to a 2‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì14 victory. It was Maher's third championship medal. Newmarket-on-Fergus were the opponents in the subsequent provincial decider A low-scoring 0‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì3 victory gave Maher his second Munster medal, however, during the game a shin- bone injury brought Bernie Scully's career to an end. The All-Ireland final on St. Patrick's weekend saw St. Finbarr's take on the Fenians of Kilkenny. St. Finbarr's won with a 3‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì6 victory. It was Maher's first All-Ireland medal. In 1977 a 1‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì5 win over north side rivals gave Maher his fourth championship medal. A 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of Sixmilebridge in a replay saw him win his third Munster medal. He later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Rathnure, the Wexford and Leinster champions, providing the opposition. Jimmy Barry-Murphy scored the deciding goal, and a 2‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Maher a second All-Ireland medal. 1980 saw Maher add a fifth championship medal to his collection as Glen Rovers were accounted for on a 1‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì4 score line. He later picked up a fourth Munster medal as Roscrea fell narrowly by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì14. A record-equaling third All-Ireland medal proved beyond St. Finbarr's who were beaten by Ballyhale Shamrocks in the decider. County championship final defeats of Glen Rovers in 1981 and Blackrock in 1982 brought Maher's championship medal tally to seven. He retired from club hurling shortly after the latter victory. In retirement from the game, Maher became chairman of the club between 1987 and 1996. He later served as secretary of the club. Minor and under-21 Maher first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the minor hurling team during Cork's unsuccessful championship campaign that year. By 1966 Maher had joined the Cork under-21 team. He won a Munster medal that year as Cork beat Limerick by 5‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 in the provincial decider. The subsequent All-Ireland final ended in a draw as Wexford recorded 5‚Äì6 to Cork's 3‚Äì12. The replay also ended all square ‚Äì 4‚Äì9 apiece. At the third time of asking Cork emerged victorious with a tally of 9‚Äì9 to 5‚Äì9. This victory gave Cork their first All-Ireland title in this grade and gave Maher, who was introduced as a substitute, an All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship medal. Senior Maher joined the Cork senior hurling team during the 1968‚Äì69 National League campaign. A 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave him his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave Maher a first Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval, and Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. Ultimately, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì9. Cork regrouped during the 1969‚Äì70 National League, and an aggregate 5‚Äì21 to 6‚Äì16 defeat of New York gave Maher his second National Hurling League medal. The subsequent championship campaign saw Maher win his second Munster medal as Tipperary were beaten 3‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì8. Cork later qualified for the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition in the very first eighty-minute championship decider. The game saw a record 64-point score line for both teams as Cork's Eddie O'Brien scored a hat-trick of goals to give Cork a considerable lead. At the full-time whistle Cork were the winners by 6‚Äì21 to 5‚Äì10, giving Maher an All-Ireland medal. In 1971 Maher became Cork's first All-Star recipient when he was named on the inaugural team of the year selection. Maher won a third Munster medal in 1972 following a 6‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì8 win over Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Cork face Kilkenny. The Rebels went eight points clear after a long-range score from wing-back Con Roche in the 17th minute of the second half. However, they didn't score again. Kilkenny took control with Pat Henderson a key figure at centre-back and Eddie Keher up front. They were level after a Frank Cummins goal and went on to win by eight points. Maher finished off the year by collecting a second All-Star award. Two years later in 1974 Maher won a third National League medal as Cork defeated Limerick on a score line of 6‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì12. The following year Maher won his fourth and final Munster medal following a 3‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of reigning provincial champions Limerick. Cork were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final in what was Maher's last appearance for Cork. Inter-provincial Maher was selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1970 and was a regular until his retirement in 1974. He enjoyed little success in this competition as Leinster dominated at the time. In 1970 Maher won his sole Railway Cup medal following a 2‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of arch-rivals Leinster. Personal life Born in Cork in 1945, Maher was educated at Greenmount School and later attended Col√°iste Chr√≠ost R√≠ where he developed a talent for hurling. Maher worked as a textile dyer after leaving school, before spending some time employed by the Ford Motor Company and later the Office of Public Works.

In Bayesian statistics it is used as the conjugate prior for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution. We say \\\\mathbf{X} follows an inverse Wishart distribution, denoted as \\\\mathbf{X}\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi, u), if its inverse \\\\mathbf{X}^{-1} has a Wishart distribution \\\\mathcal{W}(\\\\mathbf \\\\Psi^{-1}, u) . Important identities have been derived for the inverse-Wishart distribution. Density The probability density function of the inverse Wishart is: : f_{\\\\mathbf x}({\\\\mathbf x}; {\\\\mathbf \\\\Psi}, u) = \\\\frac{\\\\left|{\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi}\\\\right|^{ u/2}}{2^{ u p/2}\\\\Gamma_p(\\\\frac u 2)} \\\\left|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\right|^{-( u+p+1)/2} e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi\\\\mathbf{x}^{-1})} where \\\\mathbf{x} and {\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi} are p\\\\times p positive definite matrices, and Œìp(*) is the multivariate gamma function.

Because the prior and posterior distributions are the same family, we say the inverse Wishart distribution is conjugate to the multivariate Gaussian. Due to its conjugacy to the multivariate Gaussian, it is possible to marginalize out (integrate out) the Gaussian's parameter \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}. : f_{\\\\mathbf X\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\,\\\\Psi, u} (\\\\mathbf x) = \\\\int f_{\\\\mathbf X\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\,\\\\mathbf\\\\Sigma\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\sigma}(\\\\mathbf x) f_{\\\\mathbf\\\\Sigma\\\\,\\\\mid\\\\,\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi, u} (\\\\sigma)\\\\,d\\\\sigma = \\\\frac{|\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}|^{ u/2} \\\\Gamma_p\\\\left(\\\\frac{ u+n}{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\pi^{np/2}|\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}+\\\\mathbf{A}|^{( u+n)/2} \\\\Gamma_p(\\\\frac{ u}{2})} (this is useful because the variance matrix \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma} is not known in practice, but because {\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi} is known a priori, and {\\\\mathbf A} can be obtained from the data, the right hand side can be evaluated directly). The inverse-Wishart distribution as a prior can be constructed via existing transferred prior knowledge. Moments The following is based on Press, S. J. (1982) \\"Applied Multivariate Analysis\\", 2nd ed. (Dover Publications, New York), after reparameterizing the degree of freedom to be consistent with the p.d.f. definition above. The mean: : \\\\operatorname E(\\\\mathbf X) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf\\\\Psi}{ u-p-1}. The variance of each element of \\\\mathbf{X}: : \\\\operatorname{Var}(x_{ij}) = \\\\frac{( u-p+1)\\\\psi_{ij}^2 + ( u-p-1)\\\\psi_{ii}\\\\psi_{jj}} {( u-p)( u-p-1)^2( u-p-3)} The variance of the diagonal uses the same formula as above with i=j, which simplifies to: : \\\\operatorname{Var}(x_{ii}) = \\\\frac{2\\\\psi_{ii}^2}{( u-p-1)^2( u-p-3)}. The covariance of elements of \\\\mathbf{X} are given by: : \\\\operatorname{Cov}(x_{ij},x_{k\\\\ell}) = \\\\frac{2\\\\psi_{ij}\\\\psi_{k\\\\ell} + ( u-p-1) (\\\\psi_{ik}\\\\psi_{j\\\\ell} + \\\\psi_{i\\\\ell} \\\\psi_{kj})}{( u-p)( u-p-1)^2( u-p-3)} The results are expressed in the more succinct Kronecker product form by von Rosen as follows. : \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left ( W^{-1} \\\\otimes W^{-1} \\\\right ) = c_1 \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi \\\\+ c_2 Vec (\\\\Psi) Vec (\\\\Psi)^T + c_2 K_{pp} \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi : \\\\mathbf{Cov} \\\\left ( W^{-1} \\\\otimes W^{-1} \\\\right ) = (c_1 - c_3 ) \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi \\\\+ c_2 Vec (\\\\Psi) Vec (\\\\Psi)^T + c_2 K_{pp} \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi where c_2 = \\\\left [ ( u-p)( u-p-1)( u-p-3) \\\\right ]^{-1}, \\\\;\\\\; c_1 = ( u-p-2) c_2, \\\\; c_3 = ( u -p-1)^{-2} and K_{pp} \\\\text{is a } p^2 \\\\times p^2 commutation matrix. There is a typo in the paper whereby the coefficient of K_{pp} \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi is given as c_1 rather than c_2. Also the expression for the mean square inverse Wishart, corollary 3.1, should read \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left [ W^{-1} W^{-1} \\\\right ] = (c_1+c_2) \\\\Sigma^{-1} \\\\Sigma^{-1} + c_2 \\\\Sigma^{-1} \\\\mathbf{tr}(\\\\Sigma^{-1}) To show how the interacting terms become sparse when the covariance is diagonal, let \\\\Psi = \\\\mathbf I_{3 \\\\times 3} and introduce some arbitrary parameters u, v, w : : \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left ( W^{-1} \\\\otimes W^{-1} \\\\right ) = u \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi \\\\+ v Vec (\\\\Psi) Vec (\\\\Psi)^T + w K_{pp} \\\\Psi \\\\otimes \\\\Psi then the second moment matrix becomes : \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left ( W^{-1} \\\\otimes W^{-1} \\\\right ) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} u+v+w & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & v & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & v \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ v & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & u+v+w & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & v \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & w & \\\\cdot & u & \\\\cdot \\\\\\\\\\\\ v & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & v & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & \\\\cdot & u+v+w \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} The variances of the Wishart product are also obtained by Cook et. al. in the singular case and, by extension, to the full rank case. In the complex case, the \\"white\\" inverse complex Wishart \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{I}, u,p) was shown by Shaman to have diagonal statistical structure in which the leading diagonal elements are correlated, while all other element are uncorrelated. It was also shown by Brennan and Reed using a matrix partitioning procedure, albeit in the complex variable domain, that the marginal pdf of the [1,1] diagonal element of this matrix has an Inverse-chi-squared distribution. This extends easily to all diagonal elements since \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{I}, u,p) is statistically invariant under orthogonal transformations, which includes interchanges of diagonal elements. For the inverse Chi squared distribution, with arbitrary u_c degrees of freedom, the pdf is : \\\\text{Inv-}\\\\chi^2(x; u_c) = \\\\frac{2^{- u_c/2}}{\\\\Gamma( u_c/2)} x^{- u_c/2-1} e^{-1/(2 x)} . the mean and variance of which are \\\\frac {1}{ u_c -2} \\\\text{ and } \\\\frac {2}{( u_c-2)^2( u_c-4)} respectively. These two parameters are matched to the corresponding inverse Wishart diagonal moments when u_c = u - p +1 and hence the diagonal element marginal pdf of \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{I}, u,p) becomes: : f_{x_{11}}(x_{11}; \\\\Psi, u,p) = \\\\frac{2^{-( u-p+1)/2}}{\\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{ u-p+1}{2} \\\\right) }\\\\,x_{11}^{-( u-p+1)/2-1} e^{-1/(2 x_{11})} which, below, is generalized to all diagonal elements. Note that the mean of the complex inverse Wishart is thus \\\\frac { \\\\mathbf{I} }{ u - p } and differs from the real valued Wishart case which is \\\\frac { \\\\mathbf{I} }{ u - p -1} .  Related distributions  A univariate specialization of the inverse-Wishart distribution is the inverse-gamma distribution. With p=1 (i.e. univariate) and \\\\alpha = u/2, \\\\beta = \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}/2 and x=\\\\mathbf{X} the probability density function of the inverse-Wishart distribution becomes : p(x\\\\mid\\\\alpha, \\\\beta) = \\\\frac{\\\\beta^\\\\alpha\\\\, x^{-\\\\alpha-1} \\\\exp(-\\\\beta/x)}{\\\\Gamma_1(\\\\alpha)}. i.e., the inverse-gamma distribution, where \\\\Gamma_1(\\\\cdot) is the ordinary Gamma function. The Inverse Wishart distribution is a special case of the inverse matrix gamma distribution when the shape parameter \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{ u}{2} and the scale parameter \\\\beta =2 . Another generalization has been termed the generalized inverse Wishart distribution, \\\\mathcal{GW}^{-1}. A p \\\\times p positive definite matrix \\\\mathbf{X} is said to be distributed as \\\\mathcal{GW}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}, u,\\\\mathbf{S}) if \\\\mathbf{Y} = \\\\mathbf{X}^{1/2}\\\\mathbf{S}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{X}^{1/2} is distributed as \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}, u). Here \\\\mathbf{X}^{1/2} denotes the symmetric matrix square root of \\\\mathbf{X}, the parameters \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi},\\\\mathbf{S} are p \\\\times p positive definite matrices, and the parameter u is a positive scalar larger than 2p. Note that when \\\\mathbf{S} is equal to an identity matrix, \\\\mathcal{GW}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}, u,\\\\mathbf{S}) = \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}, u). This generalized inverse Wishart distribution has been applied to estimating the distributions of multivariate autoregressive processes. A different type of generalization is the normal- inverse-Wishart distribution, essentially the product of a multivariate normal distribution with an inverse Wishart distribution. When the scale matrix is an identity matrix, \\\\mathcal{\\\\Psi} = \\\\mathbf{I}, \\\\text{ and } \\\\mathcal{\\\\Phi} is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix, replacement of \\\\mathbf{X} by {\\\\Phi} \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathcal{\\\\Phi}^T does not change the pdf of \\\\mathbf{X} so \\\\mathcal{W}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{I}, u,p) belongs to the family of spherically invariant random processes (SIRPs) in some sense. Thus, an arbitrary p-vector V with l_2 \\\\text{ length } V^TV = 1 can be rotated into the vector \\\\mathbf{\\\\Phi}V = [1 \\\\; 0 \\\\; 0 \\\\cdots]^T without changing the pdf of V^T \\\\mathbf{X} V , moreover \\\\mathbf{\\\\Phi} can be a permutation matrix which exchanges diagonal elements. It follows that the diagonal elements of \\\\mathbf{X} are identically inverse chi squared distributed, with pdf f_{x_{11}} in the previous section though they are not mutually independent. The result is known in optimal portfolio statistics, as in Theorem 2 Corollary 1 of Bodnar et al, where it is expressed in the inverse form \\\\frac{V^T \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi} V}{V^T \\\\mathbf {X} V} \\\\sim \\\\chi^2_{ u-p+1} .

An attorney by training who became an information industry innovator and a venture capital consultant to numerous businesses, Mr. Wilson was also an internationalist and a conservationist. At the time of his death, he was chairman of Lessac Technologies Inc., a text-to- voice software venture based on nearly fifty years of partnership with Arthur Lessac. A speech about his life that Wilson gave on June 9, 2006 at Collington-Kendal was called \\"From Idealist to Idealistic Realist With a Ride on Moore's Law.\\" He concluded the story of his life saying, \\"We are in a race between having new technology destroy us and using it to save ourselves.\\"  Personal life   Upbringing  Born in New Rochelle, NY, on November 21, 1923, he was the third son of Andrew Wilson and Edith Rose Wilson. He was raised in Edgemont and Scarsdale, New York. His father was the chairman of the County Trust Company bank. He was a descendant of Sarah Wells and William Bull, early settlers of Orange County NY and builders of the Bull Stone House in Hamptonburg. Don Wilson and his wife Mary Louise Swan Baron Wilson lived in White Plains, NY for 49 years. Wilson attended public high school in Scarsdale, New York through ninth grade, and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, MA in 1941. He was the Andover Scholar in Mathematics as a freshman at Yale University. When Pearl Harbor was bombed, he and his classmates were immediately placed in an accelerated academic program, completing their studies in three years. He took a B.A. degree with honors in international relations and was an editor of the Yale Daily News. At Yale, he was a member of Berzelius and DKE. During this time, after a night of partying, he and his best friend Lou Connick were found emerging naked from the waves on a Southampton NY beach at dawn. The new civil defense beach patrol took one look at the tall blond young men and arrested them on suspicion of being Nazi spies landing in Long Island to invade the United States. Nazi spy infiltration was a serious issue at the time. Both young men were eventually released after their fathers were called to identify them, but not before a local newspaper recorded the events.  World War II  Wilson shipped out to the South Pacific in 1944 as a lieutenant junior grade on the USS Paul Hamilton. He received his Yale diploma by mail in 1945. He served in seven battle campaigns including Leyte Gulf, Mindoro, and Iwo Jima. At Okinawa, he served as assistant gunnery officer through the longest shore bombardment in U.S. history. He took command of a medium-size landing craft in San Diego and sailed it through the Panama Canal and home to Charleston, SC. He was discharged in June 1946.  Law School  Returning from the war, Wilson commuted to Columbia Law School by motorcycle from his parents' home in Edgemont, NY. He headed the Moot Court Committee, which he reorganized, and graduated in 1948 in the top 25% of his class. He loved to dance and was a sought-after partner for debutante balls and with friends in Manhattan nightclubs. He remained concerned, however, about the possibility of a new world war. He joined the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell in New York City in November 1948, and resigned in March 1949 to become an organizer for the United World Federalists (UWF). He said he did this \\"because of the conviction that another war was shaping up, that the United Nations could not keep the peace, and that the only way to prevent it was to work for development of the UN into a stronger war-prevention body.\\" (From his 1953 resume.) Wilson reentered the legal profession in 1955, joining the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison in Manhattan. The popular magazine Saturday Review was one of his accounts, and he found a mentor in its editor Norman Cousins. At Cousin's urging, Wilson and his friend William Josephson became the junior attorneys on a landmark case, Reynolds v. United States involving the skipper of a boat arrested for sailing into a Pacific nuclear test area. They also helped Cousins raise money to bring over the Hiroshima Maidens, Japanese women who needed reconstructive surgery as a result of nuclear radiation poisoning as well as the Ravensbruck Maidens, women who had been used as the subject of medical experimentation by the Nazis.  Marriage  Wilson met Mary Louise Swan Baron (known as Peter) of Wellesley, MA, in Hartford, Connecticut in 1951, when she responded to a classified ad for a secretary in the Federalist office. Sue Hepburn, the sister of actress Katharine Hepburn, was on his Board of Directors. Reputedly, she saw \\"sparks fly\\" between the young veteran and the young woman and blocked the hiring. They met again in the Connecticut offices of Bice Clemow, the editor of the West Hartford News, for whom Peter Baron was working. Six months later they married in Wellesley. They had three children Edith R. Wilson (1952), Bice C. Wilson (1954), and Anne B. Wilson (1956).  Business  Don Wilson worked with computers all his adult life, starting in the Navy. Though not an engineer, he had a driving vision of what computers could be used for in society. From his engagement with LexisNexis on, he worked with databases and encyclopedias of all sorts. He consulted to several encyclopedia companies on their electronic futures, including Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. He quickly grasped the potential of combining the exponential growth of computing power (Moore's Law) with the availability of information via the internet. He was, for all these reasons, fascinated with the power of the concept of Wikipedia, which he used as soon as it became available. Management consultant In 1960, Wilson left the law to become a management consultant at Arthur D. Little (ADL); eventually he became managing director of its New York office. During the next decade, his clients ranged from CBS Publishing, the creation of the children's toy company Creative Playthings, the introduction of the Sony Trinitron to the U.S. market, the commercial introduction of Velcro fabric, and many others. He carried out several studies of the maritime industry, including one on the introduction of containerization to the Port of New York. He recounted many times that he advised the Port of New York to introduce standardized shipping containers slowly since it would result in a major shift in labor. This advice was ignored. He was not surprised when the dockworkers union shut down the port for a series of lengthy and expensive strikes in the 1960s resulting in the agreement to pay \\"containerization royalties\\" to dockworkers for years to come.  Lexis Nexis information retrieval  Returning to Arthur D. Little in 1966 after two years as Peace Corps Director in Ethiopia, he continued to work with clients with technological innovations. In the late 1960s he was asked to develop a business plan for an Ohio software company called Data Corporation which in late 1968 had been acquired by the forst-product firm Mead Corporation. Founded by William Gorog and his partner, Lysle Cahill, Data Central had received Air Force Funding to develop a range of innovations in equipment, cameras, printers, and software. This included an Information Systems Division that had a promising on-line database software technology made possible by the power of the new IBM 360 computers. This kind of information retrieval was then in the very early stages in terms of what was technically possible. An interesting discussion of this period is found in the account of engineer Richard (Dick) Giering. The question was whether this information retrieval was a viable business, and if so, what direction it should take in terms of markets. There was already an initial relationship with the Ohio Bar Association (OBAR), which was interested in new approaches to managing legal data. Wilson and his colleagues presented their research and the resulting business plan to James McSwiney, President, William Womack, Executive Vice President and other senior officers of the Mead Corporation on February 4, 1970 in Dayton, OH. A transcript of the meeting was made, and the original business plan still exists‚Äîentitled \\" A Major Opportunity for Mead to enter the field of information services through automated legal research‚ÄîBusiness Venture Analysis.\\" On the Arthur D. Little side were H. Donald Wilson, Edward Gottsman, Jerome Rubin, Richard Erb, Edward Smith III, Robin Woodward, Anthony Gunn, and James Hoyte. William Gorog represented Data Central. Based on this study, the venture moved forward and eventually the Mead Corporation hired Wilson away from Arthur D. Little, Inc. to be the first president. Jerome Rubin also left ADL at this time and became the second president of MDC after Wilson moved to the venture's board as Vice Chairman. One of the significant factors in Lexis's success was Wilson's ability to bridge the worlds of business, law, and computers. His insider's knowledge of the sociology and particularly the hierarchy of law firms was fundamental to the business plan he and his team worked out. In this period, few lawyers knew anything about computers, and most senior attorneys disdained them. Jerome Rubin, then an attorney on the team, makes the interesting comment in the 1970 presentation about \\"knowing nothing about technology\\". Wilson, by contrast, was trained by the Navy to use early radar and had an attraction to and understanding of technological innovation. This knowledge helped shape Lexis into a viable business venture. It is clear from the 1970 presentation that Wilson understood how fundamentally this innovation would change the practice of the law, a vision that was proved out. The comments that appeared in various internet chat rooms in November 2006 when his obituary appeared attested to other people's recognition that Lexis and Nexis were transformative technological applications. Law librarians were particularly outspoken about how these innovations had changed research. It is estimated by Dr. David Evans of Carnegie Mellon that up to 1991, only 100,000 people used search engines regularly and a significant portion of those were LexisNexis users. Wilson later advised many publishers about the early development of database businesses, and worked with many startups such as Polygon, Oxford Analytica, Toxicheck, and ConQuest Software (later Excaliber) where he was Vice-Chairman. A board member of the Information Industry Association, he received its leadership award in 1992, 1993, and 1996.  Lessac System for Voice  For 58 years, Wilson was the business partner of Arthur Lessac, an internationally known professor of voice based in Manhattan. Upset at being turned down by the Yale Glee Club, Wilson first sought out Lessac as a voice coach in the 1940s. Later, Wilson gave Lessac a desk, typewriter and secretary to write The Use and Training of the Human Voice, now in its third edition. He also helped Lessac popularize this voice and body system. Lessac Technologies, Inc. (LTI) was created in 2000, and developed computer software for text-to- speech technology (TTS). As chairman of the venture, Wilson worked with the CIO, his longtime associate, Gary A. Marple, to obtain several patents in the two years before his death at the age of 82. Upon Wilson's death, John Reichenbach became President of the company.  Civic contributions   Peace Corps  In 1964, Don Wilson was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson as the second Peace Corps director for Ethiopia, the third largest country program at the time. He and his family moved to Addis Ababa for two years. Escorted by outgoing director (and fellow World Federalist) Harris Wofford, he presented his credentials to the Government. Emperor Haile Selassie said to him, in English, \\"Mr. Wilson, I fear you will have a more difficult time than your predecessor, for our students have begun to have ideas.\\" Drawing on his international relations background and his war experience, he managed up to 700 volunteers at one time in the country, and he and his wife traveled throughout the mountainous region by Landrover and Cessna plane and through East Africa on holidays with his family. Wilson studied and spoke Amharic and some Swahili, and conversed in prep school French with foreign officials. He toured schools, clinics, road building projects, and the full range of Peace Corps projects. One of the volunteers and lifelong friends was Paul Tsongas of Lowell, MA. His medical staff included Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, who later founded the National Association for Mental Illness (NAMI).  United World Federalists  In 1949, Wilson did some volunteer work for the United World Federalists (UWF), \\"meanwhile studying the movement quite carefully.\\" In June 1949, he was recruited by Cord Meyer to be office manager of the ten-man office of the New York State Branch of the United World Federalists. He then worked in various capacities for UWF in New York, Connecticut and New England. As Executive Director of the Connecticut Branch December 1950 - April 1952, he planned and managed a fight in the Connecticut Legislature concerning federalist legislation adopted in 1949 and attacked by many isolationist groups. (This is when he met his wife.) After a five-month controversy, the legislation was retained by a close vote. Then he was asked to become Executive Director of the New England Council, which he had helped organize. In that position, he supervised the political work, field organizing, educational work and fund raising for the six New England states. He later worked out of the Midwest region, based out of Cleveland, Ohio. Among the lifelong friends who were leaders of the UWF were Norman Cousins, the editor of Saturday Review magazine, Randolph Compton and Dorothy Danforth Compton, C. Max Stanley, and George C. Holt. He worked closely with Rodney Shaw, a United Methodist Church minister obituary 2/14/06 Wash Post the group's Midwest director during the same period. All of them went on to distinguish themselves as leaders on key issues of the times such as nuclear disarmament, world peace, support for the U.N., population control, and civil and human rights. In August 1955, Wilson resigned from the UWF after a dispute between the local chapters and the national leadership. He was later offered various positions including National Executive Vice-President, all of which he declined. Finally, in 1970, he returned at the request of Dr. Luther Evans (former Librarian of Congress and head of UNESCO) as Chairman to modernize the organization.  New Directions  He remained involved in international issues for the rest of his life. He advocated for the creation of a U.S. National Service program including the Peace Corps. As Chair of the World Federalists from 1970 - 1977, he worked with Margaret Mead, Father Theodore Hesburgh, Robert McNamara, Luther Evans and James Grant to found New Directions, an ambitious attempt to create a citizen's lobby on international issues. Using his corporate experience, Wilson was instrumental in introducing the use of opinion polling, public affairs advertising, direct mail marketing techniques and focus group research (aided by his longtime friend Lester Wunderman, CEO of the advertising firm Young & Rubicam) to understand donor behavior to international issues. Wunderman and he believed that such modern lobbying techniques were essential to creating political support for international issues. The organization was credited with helping to win passage of the Panama Canal Treaty, but ultimately did not obtain the necessary financial support for long term viability.  Death  Wilson never retired. In 2006 at the age of 82, he died suddenly in front of his computer while sending email and voicemail about voice technology. He and his wife had moved to Collington-Kendal Continuing Care Community in Bowie, Maryland two years earlier, where he took up choral singing and raised tomatoes.

Before joining the Enz, Crowther played trumpet in an air training corp band but swapped to drums later on. Moved to Auckland in 1969 and played drums in a couple of covers bands and Alastair Riddell's band, Orb. Riddell was at one stage a possible replacement for Phil Judd when he left Split Enz in 1977. As well as drumming on the first two Enz albums, Crowther (by this stage known as Emlyn), was an electronics and live sound expert who also built the synthesizers used on Mental Notes. Crowther invented the HotCake guitar distortion pedal in 1976, which has openly been used by Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House, Noel Gallagher of Oasis, Hugh Harris of The Kooks, Buzz Osborne of The Melvins, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Stephen Malkmus of Pavement and The Jicks, J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Nels Cline of Wilco, Ed O'Brien of Radiohead and Adrian Utley of Portishead. In 1996 he created the 'Prunes and Custard', originally designed as a bass guitar distortion pedal. The Datsuns' song \\"Harmonic Generator\\" is named after this pedal. Apparently the HotCake was re-designed from the switch to the dial after Nigel Regan from Head Like a Hole kept on breaking them while playing and was constantly taking them to get fixed. After Split Enz, Crowther drummed in a few local bands, did live mixing work for New Zealand band The Mutton Birds and was involved with a sound company between 1980-90. He currently resides in Auckland with his wife and son, and runs a company named Crowther Audio, manufacturing effects pedals and other equipment. Crowther currently plays drums for the 1960s cover band 'The Con-Rays' which includes former Split Enz keyboard player Eddie Rayner.

He represented the Wallabies in three Tests in 1904 and the Kangaroos in three Tests on the first tour of Great Britain in 1908‚Äì09. Rugby union career In Australia Born in 1879 at Cook's Hill, Newcastle, New South Wales he played rugby for the Norwood and Carlton clubs usually as a backrower and at times at fly-half. In 1899 Walsh represented Northern District (Newcastle & Hunter) against the first touring British team in a match at Newcastle. In 1903 he represented Combined Country against Metropolis (Sydney City) and Combined Country against New Zealand. He also represented New South Wales against Queensland that year. In 1904 he again represented Northern District against the touring British team and also represented New South Wales. He scored NSW's first try against Queensland and NSW's first try against the visiting British side in Sydney. That year he made his Wallaby d√©but as a number 8, playing in all three Tests against the touring British. In 1905 he represented NSW against Queensland. The rugby public were surprised when he missed selection for the national side to New Zealand. \\"Walsh's exclusion is simply a Chinese Puzzle\\".The Referee quote 19jul1905 Pat Walsh's representative honour caps Australian rules spell Disappointed he left Australia, first going to Johannesburg, South Africa where he was Vice Captain of the Commonwealth football team, premiers in the 1905 Australian Football League Competition.

In 1905 Australian Rules football was played in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Rugby union in New Zealand In 1906 he moved to Auckland, New Zealand to play rugby for Parnell in the Auckland competition which featured many 1905 All Blacks who had toured Great Britain sweeping all before them aside from a sole loss to Wales. In 1907 Walsh was chosen in the Auckland representative team to tour Southland New Zealand.

Rugby league career On return to Australia after spending the last three years in New Zealand Walsh played his first rugby league match for Queensland against New South Wales. He played for the Newcastle club in the 1908 New South Wales Rugby Football League season. He gained National selection for the inaugural 1908‚Äì09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. He travelled to England in a second ship (the Salamis) and was reported to have brought the live kangaroo mascot with him. He played in all three Tests of the tour as a Front Rower. His rugby league international d√©but in the 1st Test of 1908 in London along with Alex Burdon saw them collectively become Australia's eighth and ninth dual code rugby internationals. Pat Walsh played twenty-nine matches on the tour scoring nine tries. After the tour he remained in England accepting an offer from the Huddersfield Club where he played from 1909 to 1911 and built a reputation as one of the finest forwards in England. J.J.Giltinan 'Considered him the Finest Forward in the Northern Union'(Huddersfield rugby News.10 April 1909) On his return to Australia in 1911 he played for Central in the Newcastle Rugby League Competition and captained the Combined Newcastle & Hunter side which toured Queensland.

It is located northwest of the town of Brekstad, the administrative centre of the municipality of √òrland in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway. The civilian sector is municipal, although the runway, air traffic control and rescue services are operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The airport terminal, which has a capacity for 50 simultaneous passengers, was built in 1978 and renovated in 2007. It is served by Air Norway, operated by North Flying, with a daily round trip to Oslo and a weekly service to Aalborg. √òrland is the main airport for the district of Fosen, and it is located close enough to the city of Trondheim that Ryanair has considered it as a secondary airport. The airport served 5,546 passengers in 2014. History Planning of an airfield at √òrland was started in January 1941 and the decision was announced by the Wehrmacht on 22 April 1941. Within ten days work on expropriation for 45 landowners started. The airport was planned to have a runway,Hovd: 64 although this had been lengthened to by the time the runway was completed in late 1941. The runway was aligned roughly east‚Äìwest at 228.4 degrees and made of wood. Construction of a second, concrete runway commenced in 1942. This work took much longer time and was not completed until mid 1944. This runway is part of the northern end of the current runway. A third runway was also planned, but no more than some leveling had been completed by the end of the war in April 1945.Hovd: 65 Within days the airport had been taken over by the Royal Air Force.Hovd: 148 The air station was officially taken over by the RNoAF on 2 November 1945.Hovd: 150 Funding to upgrade the airport were dropped in 1946, but the air force continued to work with expansion proposals.Hovd: 155 √òrland saw a limited amount of civilian traffic. The first route was established by Tr√∏ndelag Flyveselskap in 1949, which operated a route to Trondheim Airport, Lade using a three-seat Auster. The route was quickly terminated.Hovd: 388 The decision to upgrade the airport was taken in 1950, following the decision that Norway would receive the F-84 Thunderjet through the Marshall Plan. They required a much longer runway than the existing de Havilland Vampires and the air force wanted to have one airport with sufficient runway length for them in each of its regions. For Central Norway the air force therefore decided to upgrade √òrland's main runway to . Construction started in April 1952 and was completed in June 1952.Hovd: 157 Work then started on the parallel runway, which was completed in November. The initial investment program for the airport concluded in July 1954 with the completion of a fire station.Hovd: 164 The air force and its 332 Squadron started using the airport on 31 May 1954.Hovd: 166 During the early 1950s, Wider√∏e and Polarfly would occasionally use the airfield for air ambulance services. Scandinavian Airlines System received permission on 3 March 1953 to use √òrlandet as an alternative airfield for its route to Northern Norway; the permission was expanded to also include their North Pole route to Los Angeles. In the course of ten years this resulted in six or seven landings. From 1958 to 1962 a direct cargo route with crabs and fish was established between √òrlandet and Stockholm, using a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar. Braathens SAFE introduced a summer scheduled service from √òrland to Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes in 1967, but there were not sufficient passengers to reintroduce it the following year. The V√¶rnes route was reopened by Wider√∏e in 1971. A small cabin was at first used as a passenger terminal, but a larger terminal building was completed in 1978. This resulted in the airport's historical peak level of service, with four daily services. An early morning and late evening flight were provided to V√¶rnes, where there was possibilities to transfer to north- and south-bound flights. Two more services were provided by flights which connected to the airports in Helgeland and Western Norway. The military enforced strict restrictions on civilian traffic until 1985, when the airport received national airport status. This resulted in a further expansion of the civilian section, especially the size of the apron. During mid-1986 the runway at V√¶rnes was to be replaced and √òrland was used as a substitute. At the same time √òrland Municipality hoped to establish a heliport at √òrland to serve oil fields in Haltenbanken, but this was instead located to Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget. Wider√∏e had throughout the 1980s been reducing its activity at √òrland and terminated its last flights in 1987. Norving chose to start four daily services, but they were forced to close them later the same year. The municipality started a push to establish a new airline at the airport. Valdresfly established a route to V√¶rnes in 1994, but was forced to close the following year. With the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in 1998, both Valdresfly and Heli-Trans wanted to fly the route, and the municipality chose Heli-Trans. The route started on 15 April 1998, but was closed in October.Hovd: 389 In 2001, low-cost carrier Ryanair announced that they were considering to open a route from √òrland to London. Ryanair stated that the fees charged at Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes was too high for them, and the municipality stated that they were willing to stretch themselves far on low landing fees to attract Ryanair. Ryanair was already serving the Oslo area from Sandefjord Airport, Torp, which is a military air station which has been converted to a low-cost airport. If started, they initially planned daily flights to London Stansted Airport. (Google translation) In September 2002, the municipality and Ryanair signed an agreement, which, if activated, would start Ryanair flights to Brekstad. However, because the airport had insufficient infrastructure, a new terminal building would need to be built. (Google translation) Investments were estimated at NOK 17 million and public transport to the airport would be provided using fast ferries. (Google translation) In March 2003, Ryanair announced that they would not start services to √òrland. Mayor Knut Morten Ring (Labor) stated that the municipality would continue to plan a new terminal, and would, if necessary, built a temporary terminal to attract the airlines.

In 2004, the Russian airline Aeroflot was considering flying fish from √òrland to Japan, but the plans were rejected by the Norwegian Air Force. (Google translation) In 2006, Air Norway experienced a 40% passenger growth, (Google translation) and from 6 September, they also introduced services on Wednesday. (Google translation) When the European Union introduced new security rules for airports from 1 January 2005, Brekstad Airport was exempt, because of the small size of the aircraft. By April, the airport had received notice that 100% security control would still have to be introduced, costing the municipality per year. At the same time, Air Norway was still losing money, and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport. (Google translation) On 3 September 2007, the terminal was renovated for NOK 1.8 million. It received a segregation of arriving and departing passengers, 100% security control and a general renovation of the building, although the capacity was not increased. In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 passengers after the Norwegian Air Force decided to not permit their employees to travel from Brekstad, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about two hours drive away. The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone in relation to the Norwegian, caused Air Norway to have lost NOK 100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of √òrland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a public service obligation.

The airline operates with an Saab 340, on the route to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen with two to three daily round trip Monday to Friday, and one to two round trip at Sundays.  Facilities  The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 15/33 with an asphalt surface measuring . The terminal has a capacity for up to 50 people per flight. Google translation) √òrland is an international airport with customs and border controls. Six people work at the airport, including three security personnel and three ground handling personnel. The operation costs the municipality NOK 680,000 per year, (Google translation) although Air Norway is exempt from paying any airport taxes. (Google translation) The airport is located a few minutes drive () outside Brekstad. It is 55 minutes by fast ferry from Brekstad to Trondheim, and two hours drive, , including a ferry.

The regatta runs for three days, ending on the second Monday in February, and dominates the whole river for the duration of the event. The regatta of 6 February 1934 was the first to be called the Royal Hobart Regatta, the title being conferred by King George V. On 1 December 1838, the first Hobart Town Anniversary Regatta was held in Hobart, Tasmania to celebrate the Tasmanian Anniversary of the 17th-century European discovery of the island by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. It was decided that the annual anniversary regatta should be celebrated by the wearing of a sprig of silver wattle blossom tied with British Navy blue ribbon. It was begun by the then Governor of Tasmania, Sir John Franklin. Franklin provided free food and beer for all of the spectators, and the tradition of free entry continues to this day. The Monday was declared as a public holiday by the governor, and is now the oldest public holiday still continuing in Australia. Since 1879 the regatta has been held in January or February, rather than December. The Hobart Regatta was not staged in 1853 and 1854. The 1942 regatta, which commemorated the 300th anniversary of Abel Tasman's exploration, was held on 5 December 1942. The 1967 regatta was cancelled because of the bushfires on 7 February 1967. Originally staged at Pavilion Point, the regatta has, since 1856, been held in grounds near Macquarie Point known as the \\"Regatta Ground\\" at the Queens Domain along the western side of the River Derwent. The grounds are now dominated by the Hobart Cenotaph, a war memorial to Tasmania's war dead. It is normally well attended by public and competitors and is usually well supported by the Royal Australian Navy, which sends a warship to be a flagship for the regatta, and sometimes the Royal Australian Air Force, who provide fly-pasts with military aircraft. Often the RAAF Roulettes will do aerobatic performances. The Australian Army's elite Red Beret parachute regiment provides sky diving displays. The events includes sailing, rowing, open water swimming, wood chopping, jet ski racing, dragon boat racing, a tug of war and a trans-Derwent swim across the 1.6 km width of the river. There is also a Miss Regatta girl competition, and the Regatta always has an official attendance ceremony by the Governor. In 2013, the Regatta celebrated 175 years of the event.

He was a driving force in the creation of the American International Group (AIG), a collector of paintings by John Constable and his contemporaries, and a generous benefactor to the arts, the church and medicine. Knighted in 1994 for charitable services to the Tate Gallery he was, after Sir Henry Tate, the most generous benefactor in its history and continued to involve himself in the affairs of the gallery well into his 90s. Early life Sir Edwin was born in Earls Colne, Essex, 20 miles from Constable's birthplace. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Westcliff-on-Sea on the Thames estuary, a location that gave him a lifelong affection for expanses of water and sky and which he much later recalled by acquiring paintings of the area by the English painter John Wonnacott. However, during the first world war the family moved to Shaftesbury in Dorset. There he eventually enrolled at Shaftesbury Grammar School where he stayed on as a boarder, even after the family had moved to London. American International Group In 1926, he declined a scholarship to Cambridge, instead following an uncle's introduction to the Paris agent of the Caledonian Insurance Company. In 1933, he was offered a post in New York. He joined as a casualty underwriter with the then small American International Underwriter Group, later the AIG, one of a number of companies established by Cornelius Vander Starr. Soon afterwards, he married an American, Florence Brewer, known to all as Gretchen and they later had a daughter Diana. In 1939, he returned to London and volunteered for service, but was rejected on medical grounds having suffered from Stokes-Adams disease. He became president of the American International Underwriters' Corporation in 1942. He served as president of AIU from 1942 to 1969. He took over the chairmanship of AIU in 1969, retiring officially in 1975. At his death, he was an honorary director of and senior advisor to AIG. During his most influential years, the company grew to a force of more than 50,000 people and Manton became a leading figure in the American insurance business. His shareholding in AIG made him very wealthy and he was ranked as the 83rd richest person in the United Kingdom according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2003. https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/16/business/16manton.html Art Collecting After the second world war, he began to collect British paintings. His particular enthusiasm was for Constable. During the 1960s and 1970s, he assembled one of the best collections in private hands, in spite of competition from Paul Mellon among others. During this period, Constable scholars began to distinguish more rigorously between the works of John Constable, his son Lionel, and followers. In the early 1980s, Manton came to know Leslie Parris, deputy keeper of the British Collection at the Tate, who, together with Ian Fleming-Williams and Graham Reynolds, were the leading authorities in the field. Manton discovered many of the works in his collection were what he called Constabiles, rather than works by the master, but Manton took this to be part of the learning process and became close friends with Parris in particular. Philanthropy His friendship with Parris resulted in the offer of a contribution to the Tate's 1987 appeal for funds to acquire Constable's The Opening of Waterloo Bridge, and shortly afterwards a gift of AIG shares, which established the American Fund for the Tate Gallery with an endowment of $6.5m in 1988. Manton never took up US citizenship, retaining his British nationality until his death. In 1997, he established the American Fund for the Tate Gallery with an endowment generated by a gift of AIG shares. In creating a fund that would respond to the Tate's wish to strengthen its American collection, he was giving expression both to his affection for his birthplace and to his enthusiasm for his adopted country. By 2005, the fund was worth $30m, and made possible the acquisition of major works by Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, Donald Judd, David Smith, Louise Bourgeois, Ellsworth Kelly, Bruce Nauman and Cildo Meireles. Manton deliberately established the fund in a form that would allow American citizens to make donations which would support the mission of the Tate and this has stimulated very significant gifts of works of art and more than $70m in donations. In 1992 and 1997, Manton made further gifts totalling nearly ¬£12m towards the centenary development and other projects at Tate Britain; he also made a promised bequest of a major Constable, The Glebe Farm. These magnificent gifts allowed the trustees to transform the presentation of British art at Millbank as Tate Britain, in 2001. Taken together, Manton's benefactions, enhancing both the British and international collections, are by far the most generous gift in the history of the Tate. Manton also was a longtime parishioner at the Episcopal Church of the Ascension in New York City, and bequeathed the church money for a pipe organ. The 6,183-pipe, 95-stop Manton Memorial Organ was the first French-built pipe organ in New York City and was installed in 2011.

Susac‚Äôs syndrome. Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences. 2011 March, 38(2):335-337. The cause is unknown but the current thinking is that antibodies are produced against endothelial cells in tiny arteries which leads to damage and the symptoms related to the illness. Despite this being an extremely rare disease, there are 4 registries collecting data on the illness; two are the United States, one in Germany, and one in Portugal. Presentation Susac's syndrome is named for Dr. John Susac (1940‚Äì2012), of Winter Haven, Florida, who first described it in 1979. Susac's syndrome is a very rare disease, of unknown cause, and many persons who experience it do not display the bizarre symptoms named here. Their speech can be affected, such as the case of a female of late teens who suffered speech issues and hearing problems, and many experience unrelenting and intense headaches and migraines, some form of hearing loss, and impaired vision. The problem usually corrects itself, but this can take up to five years. In some cases, subjects can become confused. The syndrome usually affects women around the age of 18 years, with female to male ratio of cases of 2:1. William F. Hoyt was the first to call the syndrome \\"Susac syndrome\\" and later Robert Daroff asked Dr. Susac to write an editorial in Neurology about the disorder and to use the eponym of Susac syndrome in the title, forever linking this disease with him. Pathogenesis In the March 1979 report in Neurology, Drs. Susac, Hardman and Selhorst reported two patients with the triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss and microangiopathy of the retina. The first patient underwent brain biopsy, which revealed sclerosis of the media and adventitia of small pial and cortical vessels, suggestive of a healed angiitis. Both patients underwent fluorescein retinal angiography that demonstrated multifocal retinal artery occlusions without evidence of embolic disease. Though the exact pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, the retinal and brain biopsy findings suggest a small vessel vasculopathy leading to arteriolar occlusion and microinfarction of cerebral, retinal and cochlear tissue. Demyelination is not a typical feature of Susac's syndrome. Muscle biopsies from such patients are usually normal, but some have also shown nonspecific signs of inflammation such as dense hyaline material surrounding endomysial capillaries. This suggests a possible systemic component of this disease, despite the predominance of central nervous system features. The latest thinking is that an antibody directed against endothelial cells is the pathogenic mechanism in this disease which causes the microscopic strokes in the brain, retina, and inner ear. Diagnosis Patients typically present with low frequency hearing loss detectable via an audiogram. Headaches are frequently present in addition to roaring tinnitus and often some degree of paranoia. Partial vision loss is often present and caused by branch retinal artery occlusions. The presence of refractile or non-refractile yellow Gass plaques in the retinal arterioles is near pathognomonic for the disease. Fluorescein angiography may demonstrate leakage in areas remote from the retinal infarctions. Radiographic appearance In a recent analysis (Susac et al., 2003), MRI images from 27 patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Susac's syndrome were reviewed. Multifocal supratentorial lesions were present in all patients. Most lesions were small (3 to 7 mm), though some were larger than 7 mm. All 27 patients had corpus callosum lesions. These all had a punched-out appearance on follow up MRI. Though most commonly involving white matter, many patients also had lesions in deep grey matter structures, as well as leptomeningeal enhancement. Multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can mimic the MRI changes seen in patients with Susac's syndrome. However, the callosal lesions in Susac's syndrome are centrally located. In comparison, patients with MS and ADEM typically have lesions involving the undersurface of the corpus callosum. Deep gray matter involvement commonly occurs in ADEM but is very rare in MS. Leptomeningeal involvement is not typical of either MS or ADEM. What this means is that if 10 lesions are found in the brain of an MS patient, a lesion may be found in the corpus callosum. If you have 10 lesions in a Susac patient, more than half will be in the corpus callosum. A concern about this illness is that it mimics multiple sclerosis when looking at the vision loss and brain lesions. If close attention is not paid to the retina of a patient with vision loss and brain lesions, their symptoms may be mistaken for MS instead of Susac's syndrome. This may account for the low prevalence of the illness. There is also a pathological similarity between the endotheliopathy in Susac's syndrome with that seen in juvenile dermatomyositis. Treatment Early and aggressive treatment is important to prevent irreversible neurological damage, hearing loss, or vision loss. Medications used include immunosuppressive agents and corticosteroids such a prednisone, or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). Other drugs that have been used are mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept), azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and anti-TNF therapies. Hearing aids or cochlear implants may be necessary in the event of hearing loss. References * Egan RA, Nguyen TH, Gass JDM, Rizzo JF, Tivnan J, Susac JO.

Widely considered a groundbreaking work in sociology of education, it argues the \\"correspondence principle\\" explains how the internal organization of schools corresponds to the internal organisation of the capitalist workforce in its structures, norms, and values. For example, the authors assert the hierarchy system in schools reflects the structure of the labour market, with the head teacher as the managing director, pupils fall lower down in the hierarchy. Wearing uniforms and discipline are promoted among students from working class, as it would be in the workplace for lower levels employees. Education provides knowledge of how to interact in the workplace and gives direct preparation for entry into the labour market. They also believe work casts a \\"long shadow\\" in education ‚Äì education is used by the bourgeoisie to control the workforce. From their point of view schools reproduce existing inequalities and they reject the notion that there are equal opportunities for all. In this way they argue that education justifies and explains social inequality. The book is now considered the key text for the Marxist theory of sociology of education. Criticisms Bowles and Gintis have been criticised: * Philip Brown and Hugh Lauder (1991) argue that Bowles and Gintis have simplified the correspondence between education and the labour market. They go on further to state that there are changes in the importance of bureaucratic control in work organisations ‚Äì it has reduced and there is an increased importance of team working. * Michael Apple (1982, 1986) examined the hidden curriculum and concludes teachers are being proletarianised as the profession is de-skilled through the standardised curriculum. This increases state control over teachers and how they carry out their functions. He believes schools are sites of struggle and reproduction of inequalities persist. The formal curriculum is class biased. Reproduction of high status academic knowledge is prioritised through the schooling of those who are not poor or part of a minority. Textbooks neglect social conflict, which contribute to the ideological reproduction of capitalism. * However Ramsey (1983) conducted a larger survey of schools and found a great deal of variation among working class schools. * Hannan and Boyle (1987) argue the management and attitude of teachers control the ethos of a working class school, not all working class schools prepare their students for failing. * David Reynolds (1984) ‚Äì Bowles and Gintis ignore the influence of the formal curriculum. Much of the British school curriculum does not promote the development of an ideal employee under capitalism. The curriculum fails to teach skills needed by employers. * Willis (1977) ‚Äì Bowles and Gintis did not carry out detailed research into life in schools and they made assumptions that the hidden curriculum was actually influencing pupils. Many pupils had disrespect for the school rules and for the authority of the teacher. Working class \\"lads\\" learned to behave at school in ways that do not fit with capitalism's need for a passive workforce.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 428 & 664 Allen Lane 2012 The grape was named after the breeding station Domaine de la Calmette. As a teinturier, Grand noir is often used to add color to wines that it is blended into but is paler than other choices such as Alicante Bouschet. The vine tends to bud late and has a high productivity but with some susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of powdery mildew. J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 207 Mitchell Beazley 1986 While Grand Noir de la Calmette originated in France and was once widely grown in the Cognac and Languedoc wine regions, today it is rarely planted in that country. Instead, the variety is predominately found in the Spanish wine regions of Galicia in northwest Spain and in the southern Portuguese wine regions of Alentejo. Grand Noir de la Calmette is often compared with its sibling grape, Alicante Bouschet, and the wines that both varieties produce tend to be very similar though Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that those made from Grand Noir de la Calmette tend to have more noticeable \\"peppery\\" spice. History Grand Noir de la Calmette was created in 1855 by French grape breeder Henri Bouschet at his Domaine de la Calmette vineyard near Montpellier. The grape is a crossing of the Vitis vinifera species Aramon noir and Petit Bouschet (the later a crossing of Aramon and Teinturier du Cher created by Henri's father Louis Bouschet). That same year Bouschet use Petit Bouschet in another crossing with Graciano to create Morrastel Bouschet. At same point Morrastel Bouschet was introduced to the California as Grand Noir de la Calmette where it made its way to the grape collection at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology. The grapevines were misidentified until only recently when ampelographers discovered the error. True Grand Noir de la Calmette does exist in California with two vineyards, in Windsor, California located in the Russian River Valley AVA of Sonoma County and Kuchan Cellars of Morgan Hill, California in Santa Clara Valley AVA having old vines that date back to the early 1900s. Viticulture and winemaking An example of the difference between a red fleshed teinturier grape (Agria left) and a red wine grape variety with its skin peeled off to show that its flesh and juice is naturally white (Grenache right). The vast majority of red wine grapes are like the Grenache on the right with the red color of wine coming from skin contact during winemaking. Grand Noir de la Calmette is a high yielding grape variety that needs to be kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. It can be limited by plantings in vineyard soils of low fertility, however, vines planted in those types of soils do run the risk of shriveling. Among the viticultural hazards that Grand Noir de la Calmette is most susceptible to is powdery mildew. While most wine grape varieties, even those such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache used to make red wine, have \\"white flesh\\" that yield white or greyish colored juice, Grand Noir de la Calmette is a teinturier grape that has red color flesh that yields red colored juice without needing any skin contact to leach color into the wine. However, the juice of Grand Noir de la Calmette is very pale (especially compared to other Bouschet varieties such as Alicante Bouschet) so the wine often does see some maceration time. Wine regions Grand Noir de la Calmette is planted throughout Galicia but is most often found in the Ribeira Sacra and Valdeorras DOs. While Grand Noir de la Calmette originated in France, and was once widely planted in the Cognac and Languedoc wine region, today it is rarely planted in the country with less than in cultivation in 2008. The grape is much more prominent on the Iberian peninsula with in Spain and in Portugal. In Spain, Grand Noir de la Calmette is a permitted variety in the Denominaci√≥n de Origen (DO) wines of Ribeira Sacra and Valdeorras. Here the grape seems to handle the humid climate of Galicia and is often used to add color to the wines. In Portugal, Grand Noir de la Calmette is found mostly in the Portalegre wine region of Alentejo where it is blended with Alicante Bouschet, Tempranillo and Trincadeira. Outside of Europe, some plantings of the grape can be found in California where 100+ year old vines still exist in the Sonoma wine region of the Russian River Valley. Synonyms Over the years, Grand noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Galliko, Gkiobrek Kara, Gkranoba, Grand Bouschet (in Alentejo region of Portugal), Gran Negro (in the Valdeorras DO of Spain), Gran Noar, Gran Nuar de Lya Kalmett, Grand Chernyi, Granoir, Granua, Gros noir (in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques department of France), Gros Producteur, Kalmettei Fekete, Kalmettei Nagy Fekete, Pe de Perdiz, Pe de Pombo, Sousao do Oeste, Sumo tinto (in Portugal), Tinta, Tinta Fina, Tinta Francesa and Tinturao.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Grand noir Accessed: May 26th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Grand Noir de la Calmette"},{"id":"8143666","title":"Mabel Gay"},{"id":"8143692","title":"Yusmay Bicet"},{"id":"8143703","text":"On Human Nature (1978; second edition 2004) is a book by the biologist E. O. Wilson, in which the author attempts to explain human nature and society through sociobiology. Wilson argues that evolution has left its traces on characteristics such as generosity, self-sacrifice, worship and the use of sex for pleasure, and proposes a sociobiological explanation of homosexuality. He attempts to complete the Darwinian revolution by bringing biological thought into social sciences and humanities. Wilson describes On Human Nature as a sequel to his earlier books The Insect Societies (1971) and Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975). The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979. Summary Wilson writes that On Human Nature is the third of a trilogy, the previous volumes of which were The Insect Societies (1971) and Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975), and that its thesis is that general sociobiology, \\"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization\\", is the appropriate means of closing \\"the famous gap between the two cultures\\". He proposes that homosexuality may be \\"a distinctive beneficent behavior that evolved as an important element of early human social organization\\", describing it as \\"above all a form of bonding\\", possibly based on a genetic predisposition. Reception The biologist Jerry Coyne accused Wilson of trying to use evolutionary psychology to control social science and social policy in The New Republic, arguing that On Human Nature was similar in this respect to Wilson's subsequent book Consilience (1998) and to the biologist Randy Thornhill and the anthropologist Craig Palmer's A Natural History of Rape (2000). Bryan Walsh in 2011 named On Human Nature as one of the \\"100 best and most influential\\" books written in English since 1923 in Time. He considered Wilson's \\"real achievement\\" to be to \\"show how a sociobiological view of humanity could still have grandeur.\\" The computer scientist Paul Brown in 2018 stated in Skeptical Inquirer that On Human Nature is \\"still brimful with ideas and insights about who we are, how we got here, and how to get wherever we want to go.\\" On Human Nature was discussed by Gregory Hanlon in the Journal of Interdisciplinary History. Hanlon credited Wilson with helping to establish that human behavior could not be understood solely in terms of \\"learned cultural values\\", that the behavioral sciences could help to explain \\"the interpersonal actions in past societies.\\" He compared the book to the ethnologist Iren√§us Eibl-Eibesfeldt's Human Ethology (1989) and the historian Daniel Lord Smail's Deep History and the Brain (2008). The anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy argued that a reading of On Human Nature refutes the accusation that Wilson aims to use sociobiology to reinforce traditional sex roles. The philosopher Roger Scruton criticized Wilson's sociobiological explanations of human social behavior, arguing that because of Wilson's \\"polemical purpose\\" he was forced to oversimplify the facts. However, he granted that sociobiological explanations of the sort favored by Wilson might possibly be correct. The anthropologist Donald E. Brown commented that he at first failed to read Wilson's book because his views were still conditioned by the \\"sociocultural perspectives\\" in which he had been trained. However, Brown concluded that \\"sociobiologists might be more convincing if they confined their explanations to universals rather than attempting to show that virtually everything that humans do somehow maximizes their reproductive success.\\" Science writers John Gribbin and Mary Gribbin described On Human Nature as an \\"accessible account of the application of sociobiology to people\\". The sociologist Ullica Segerstr√•le described On Human Nature as essentially a development of Wilson's earlier ideas. She commented that, unlike opponents of sociobiology, Wilson saw it as having liberal political implications, and tried to develop these suggestions in On Human Nature. The psychologist David P. Barash and Ilona A. Barash called On Human Nature, \\"A wide-ranging, thoughtful, and controversial classic of human sociobiology\\". On Human Nature won a 1979 Pulitzer Prize.

She was the wife of Theo van Gogh, art dealer, and the sister-in-law of the painter Vincent van Gogh and became a key player in the growth of Vincent's fame.  Early life  Johanna Gezina Bonger was born on 4 October 1862 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. She was the fifth of seven children, the daughter of Hendrik Christiaan Bonger (1828‚Äì1904), an insurance broker, and Hermine Louise Weissman (1831‚Äì1905). Her youngest brother, Willem Adriaan Bonger (1876‚Äì1940) became an important criminologist. The family was musical, holding evening performances of quartets, and Johanna became an accomplished piano player. Unlike her elder sisters, who helped out with household duties, Johanna, a \\"cheerful and lively child\\", was permitted to further her education by studying English, and earning the equivalent of a college degree. She stayed some months in London, working in the British Museum library.Van Gogh: The Life. S Naifeh & G. White Smith. Profile Books (2012) p450 From the age of seventeen she kept a detailed diary, which was to become a source of much information about Vincent van Gogh. At this time she also came under the influence of the non-conformist writer Multatuli.  Adulthood  Jo with son Vincent Willem at the studio of photographer Raoul Saisset, 4 Rue Frochot, Paris, 1890 At the age of twenty-two she became a teacher of English at a boarding school for girls at Elburg, later teaching at the High School for Girls at Utrecht. About this time while in Amsterdam she was introduced by her brother Andries to Theo van Gogh, brother of Vincent. One of the Van Gogh sisters described her as \\"smart and tender\\". First marriage Theo became preoccupied with Johanna, and the following year paid a visit to Amsterdam to declare his love. Surprised and annoyed that a man she hardly knew should wish to marry her, she rejected him. However, she accepted his proposal the following year, and they were married in Amsterdam on 17 April 1889. Their son Vincent Willem, was born on 31 January 1890. Following Theo's death in January 1891, Johanna was left a widow with her infant son to support. She was left with only an apartment in Paris filled with a few items of furniture and about 200 then valueless works of her brother-in-law Vincent.Memoirs of V.W.Van Gogh http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/memoir/nephew/1.html Although advised to dispose of the pictures, she instead moved back to the Netherlands, opened a boarding house in Bussum, a village 25 km from Amsterdam, and began to re- establish her artistic contacts. She had not kept her diary during her marriage, but resumed it, intending that her son should read it someday. To earn extra income she translated short stories from French and English into Dutch. In 1905, to the evident disapproval of her family, she was one of the founding members of a women's socialist movement, but did not allow this to interfere with raising her son. In 1892, while organizing an exhibition of Vincent's works, she was harshly criticized by artist Richard Roland Holst: > \\"Mrs Van Gogh is a charming little woman, but it irritates me when someone > gushes fanatically on a subject she knows nothing about, and although > blinded by sentimentality still thinks she is adopting a strictly critical > attitude. It is schoolgirlish twaddle, nothing more. [...] The work that Mrs > Van Gogh would like best is the one that was the most bombastic and > sentimental, the one that made her shed the most tears; she forgets that her > sorrow is turning Vincent into a god.\\"Quoted in J.M. Joosten, \\"Van Gogh > publicaties (15) deel 6\\", Museumjournaal 15 (1970), pp. 157-58, note 61. Second marriage Johanna Bonger, by her second husband Johan Cohen Gosschalk, 1905In August 1901, she married Johan Cohen Gosschalk (1873‚Äì1912), a Dutch painter who was born in Amsterdam. She was widowed again in 1912. In 1914, she moved Theo's body from Utrecht to Auvers-sur-Oise and interred it next to Vincent's grave. A sprig of ivy taken from the garden of Dr Paul Gachet carpets both graves to this day. Work and van Gogh letters After the death of Vincent and her husband, she worked assiduously on editing the brothers' correspondence, producing the first volume in Dutch in 1914. She also played a key role in the growth of Vincent's fame and reputation through her donations of his work to various early retrospective exhibitions. She wrote a Van Gogh family history as well. Johanna van Gogh stayed in contact with Vincent van Gogh's friend Eug√®ne Boch to whom she offered the painting portrait of Eugene Boch in July 1891. She also stayed in touch with √âmile Bernard, who helped her to promote Vincent van Gogh's paintings. The legacy and renown of Vincent van Gogh the long-suffering artist began to spread in the years after his death; first in the Netherlands, and Germany and then throughout Europe. His friendship with his younger brother Theo was documented in numerous letters they exchanged from August 1872 onwards. Van Gogh-Bonger published the letters in three volumes in 1914. Johanna initially worked closely with German art dealers and publishers Paul Cassirer and his cousin Bruno to organize exhibitions of Van Gogh's paintings in Berlin and in 1914 to publish the first volume of the Letters to Theo. Publication of the letters helped spread the compelling mystique of Vincent van Gogh, the intense and dedicated painter who suffered for his art and died young, throughout Europe and the rest of the world. Later life She lived in New York from 1915 to 1919, where she began the work of translating Vincent's letters into English. In 1919, she returned to Amsterdam. She died on 2 September 1925, at the age of 62, in Laren, Netherlands. At the time of her death, she was still occupied translating 526 of Vincent's letters into English. She had one child and four grandchildren.

A right-hander, Coates pitched in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees (1956, 1959‚Äì62), Washington Senators (1963), Cincinnati Reds (1963) and Los Angeles/California Angels (1965‚Äì67). He was born in Farnham, Virginia, attended Lively High School, and was listed as tall and . Career Early career Coates was signed by the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1951. He spent seven years in the Yankees‚Äô farm system with a call-up in 1956, during which he made his major league debut. Coates spent all of the next two seasons in the minors but saw limited play in 1958 due to a fractured elbow.New Yank ace credits Lopat Fully recovered in 1959, Coates pitched in 37 games, all but four in relief, winning six games against one loss, with a 2.87 earned run average in 100‚Öì innings pitched. The season, however, was disastrous for the Yankees as a whole‚Äîafter winning seven World Series and nine American League pennants in ten seasons, and winning 103 games in 1954, the one year in that stretch when they didn‚Äôt win the pennant (the Cleveland Indians won 111), the Yankees, beset by injuries all season, finished third, 15 games behind the American League champion Chicago White Sox. The lowlight of the Yankees‚Äô season was falling to dead last on May 20. 1960 World Series In 1960, Coates went 13‚Äì3 as a spot starter in Casey Stengel's much-maligned rotation. After winning his last five decisions in 1959 and his first nine this season, Coates finally had his winning streak broken against the Boston Red Sox on July 9, a 6‚Äì5 loss in which Vic Wertz drove in four of the runs. Coates was also named to the All-Star team, pitching two scoreless innings in the first of two games played that year (between 1959 and 1962, Major League Baseball had two All-Star games). Coates in 1960 Coates was a member of the Yankee team that regained the American League pennant in 1960, but lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series in seven games. In Game 1, Coates gave up a home run by Bill Mazeroski for the deciding runs in the Pirates‚Äô 6‚Äì4 victory. Before Ralph Terry gave up Mazeroski's second home run of this Series (the walk-off home run that won Game 7 10‚Äì9 for the Pirates and ended the Series), Coates himself was almost the scapegoat in the Yankees‚Äô loss. With the Yankees ahead 7‚Äì5 with no outs (and one run in) in the eighth inning and Bill Virdon on second and Dick Groat on first, Coates relieved Bobby Shantz and got Bob Skinner out on a sacrifice bunt, which advanced the runners. Rocky Nelson then flew out to Roger Maris in right field, and Virdon declined to challenge Maris‚Äô throwing arm. Coates then got to an 0‚Äì2 count on Roberto Clemente and was a strike away from getting the Yankees out of trouble. However, a lapse by Coates allowed the Pirates to keep their inning alive. Clemente eventually chopped a ground ball toward first base, and Coates initially ran toward the ball instead of running directly to cover first base. First baseman Moose Skowron fielded the ball as Coates changed direction and ran to the first base bag. But the momentary delay enabled Clemente to reach the base right as Coates got there himself. Skowron was forced to hold on to the ball, and Virdon scored to cut the Yankee lead to 7‚Äì6. Coates then gave up a home run to Hal Smith to give the Pirates a 9‚Äì7 lead. Terry then relieved Coates and retired Don Hoak to finally end the inning. The Yankees got Coates off the hook by scoring twice in the top of the ninth to tie the game, only to lose on Mazeroski's home run off Terry in the bottom of the 9th. The Pirates had hit four home runs in this Series; Coates had given up two of them. 1961 and 1962 championships In 1961, Coates went 11‚Äì5 as a spot starter. Led by the hitting of Maris, Skowron, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Elston Howard, the infield defense of Clete Boyer, Tony Kubek and Bobby Richardson, and Whitey Ford's 25‚Äì4 season, the now-Ralph Houk- led Yankees (Stengel had been fired immediately after the 1960 World Series) won the World Series over the Cincinnati Reds in five games. Coates relieved Ford in Game 4 of the Series and pitched four scoreless innings for the save in a 7‚Äì0 Yankee win; Ford had left the game with an injury, but not without first breaking Babe Ruth's World Series record of 29‚Öî consecutive scoreless innings. In 1962, Coates went 7‚Äì6 for a Yankee team that repeated as World Series champions, defeating the San Francisco Giants in seven games. Coates was the losing pitcher in Game 4 but he threw 2‚Öì shutout innings in relief of Ford in Game 6. It would be Coates' last appearance in a New York uniform. Senators, Reds and Angels Traded away by the Yankees (for left-handed reliever Steve Hamilton) on April 21, 1963, Coates would pitch another 80 games for three MLB teams through 1967. His record was only 6‚Äì7 with a 4.48 ERA and two saves after leaving the Bronx, although as a starting pitcher for the Angels on August 14, 1966, he fired a four-hit, complete game shutout against the White Sox, the fourth whitewashing of his big-league career. He also put up several strong campaigns in the Pacific Coast League during his late career, including a 17-win season for the 1968 Seattle Angels. He retired at age 38 after the 1970 minor-league season, his 19th in professional baseball. Legacy In his 247-game MLB career, Coates, whose nickname, \\"The Mummy\\", came from his funereal visage on the mound, won 43 games against 22 losses (a winning percentage of .662), with 17 saves, 13 complete games, four shutouts, a 4.00 ERA and 396 strikeouts in 683‚Öì innings pitched. He surrendered 650 hits and 286 bases on balls. As a Yankee, he went 37‚Äì15 (.712) with a 3.84 earned run average during the regular season; in six World Series games he lost his only decision, earned one save and posted a 4.15 ERA, allowing eight hits and three bases on balls, with eight strikeouts, in 13 innings pitched. Coates was also well known for throwing at opposing batters. Jim Bouton, in his book, Ball Four, said Coates, after throwing at the opposing hitters, \\"would not get into the fights that followed.\\" In 2012, Coates published an autobiography titled Always a Yankee. In 1994, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

It has the highest number of coral species of any subtropical reef system along Australia's east coast and is the nearest true coral reef to Brisbane. Flinders Reef is one of Queensland's most popular dive sites. The reef is located within the Moreton Bay Marine Park and is monitored by the Reef Check conservation program. There is a second Flinders Reef in the Coral Sea north-east of Townsville. A weather station there is monitored by the Australian Government. A third Flinders Reef exists offshore from the town of 1770. Fauna The reef has more than 175 fish species. There are more species and varieties of corals in this one area than any other single reef on the Great Barrier Reef. The diverse amount of marine life include schools of wrasse, sweetlip, trevally, parrotfish, bat, surgeon, turtles and tropical fish. Manta rays, wobbegongs and leopard sharks are among the larger creatures that reside here. Sightings of whaler sharks are sometimes seen on the eastern side of Flinders. During the months of June to September, humpback whales can be seen on the surface as they pass by. History In 1986 the Australian Army ship Crusader (AV2767) was sunk near the reef and has become a popular dive wreck. The reef was zoned as a marine park in 1998. The reef was not affected by the 2009 southeast Queensland oil spill. The reef is often the location for small fishing boat wrecks, and rarely, diving incidents including the death of a Brisbane man in March 2005. It was the site of a helicopter rescue after a dive ship ran aground on the reef in December 2008.

Gliding is a competitive sport and was even a demonstration sport at the 1936 Summer Olympics. It was due to become an official Olympic sport in the Helsinki Games in 1940.

For gliding, international competition has been provided by the World Gliding Championships since 1938 and also by the European Gliding Championships since 1982.

It is sometimes extended to include audio/video conferencing or instant messaging systems that provide a text-based multi-user chat function. The word synchronous is used to qualify the conferencing as real-time, as distinct from a system such as e-mail, where messages are left and answered later. Synchronous conferencing protocols include: * IRC (Internet Relay Chat) * PSYC (Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing) * SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol) * XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) * SIMPLE (instant messaging protocol) (Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)  Types  According to the type of media used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into * audio conferencing: only audio is used * video conferencing: Both audio (voice) and video and picture are used. According to the number of access point used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into * point-to-point: Only two computers are connected end to end. * multi-point: Two or more than two computers are connected together.  Synchronous vs asynchronous conferencing  Both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing are online conferencing where the participants can interact while being physically located at different places in the world. Asynchronous conferencing allows the students to access the learning material at their convenience while synchronous conferencing requires that all participants including the instructor and the students be online at the time of conference. While synchronous conferencing enables real time interaction of the participants, asynchronous conferencing allows participants to post messages and others can respond to it at any convenient time. Sometimes a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing is used. Both the methods give a permanent record of the conference.  Methods  Some of the methods used in synchronous conferencing are: * Chat (text only): Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share resources and ideas. There is also option to save the chat and archive it for later review. * Voice (telephone or voice-over IP): This is a conference call between the instructor and the participating students where they can speak through built-in microphone or a headset. * Video conferencing: This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually, a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or a content. * Web conferencing: This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing, participants of a web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well. * Internet radio/podcasts: The instructors makes the audio file available in the Internet which is archived and the students subscribed to the podcast can download it. * Virtual worlds: In this set up, students can meet in virtual world and speak with each other through headsets and VoIP. This can make the learning more productive and engaging when the students are able to navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar.  Critical factors for effective implementation  There are four critical factors identified for implementing synchronous conferencing for effective instruction to the students * Video and audio quality which depends on technical factors like higher bandwidth and processing capabilities of the system. * Training time which depends on the familiarity and proficiency of the instructors and the students with the technology. * Teaching strategies which depends on the adaptability of the instructors with the new methods, preparing appropriate and effective training materials and motivating students. * Direct meeting of the instructor and the students.  Synchronous conferencing in higher education  Synchronous conferencing in education helps in the delivery of content through digital media. Since this is a real-time teaching, it also brings the benefits of face-to-face teaching in distance learning. Many higher education institutions offer well-designed quality e-learning opportunities. Some of the advantages of synchronous conferencing in education are: * Helps the students to connect with not only their own teachers and peers but also with recognized experts in the field regardless of the geographical distance and different time zones. * Provides opportunities to both the teachers and the students to expand their knowledge outside the classrooms. * Helps students who are home-bound or limited mobility to connect with their classrooms and participate in learning. * Helps the faculties to conduct classes when they are not able to come to classes due to an emergency. * Supports real-time collaboration, interaction and immediate feedback * Encourage students to learn together and in turn develop cultural understanding * Personalized learning experience for the students * Real-time discussion opportunities for students promoting student engagement * Active interaction can lead to an associated community of like- minded students * Saves travel expenses and time  Implementation of educational technology  The tools for implementing synchronous conferencing depends on the type of educational problem addressed. This is in turn decides the method of synchronous conferencing to be used and the tool to be used in the learning context. The tool selected addresses the problem of improving the learning outcomes which cannot be solved with an asynchronous environment. There are many tools and platforms available for synchronous conferencing. * Smartphone applications * Web conferencing tools * Video conferencing tools * Video and hangout platforms * Shared whiteboards The selection of tools and platforms also depend on the group size which depends on the activity for the course design.  Effective teaching strategies  To make synchronous conferencing effective and engaging, appropriate teaching strategies are important and plays a very important role in making the learning successful. Some of these are * Emphasizing and adhering to time allotted  Limitations  Some limitations for synchronous conferencing in learning are: * Disjointed discussions, not connected in time * Lack of effective moderation and/or clear guidelines for learners * Difficulty in collaborating online projects * Lack of proper communication with the instructor and students. * Technical issues may arise if not analysed and planned in advance * Lack of familiarity with the tools * Limited time to complete the learning activity and to incorporate interactions of the learners  See also  * Collaborative software (Groupware) * MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) References Category:Online chat Category:Teleconferencing Category:Educational technology Category:Groupware ","title":"Synchronous conferencing"},{"id":"8143993","text":"The Battle of Nanri Island () was a conflict between the Republic of China Army (ROCA) and the People's Liberation Army (PLA), over Nanri Island in today's Nanri Town, Xiuyu District, Putian, Fujian, People's Republic of China off the coast of Mainland China. This conflict occurred from 11 October 1952, to 15 October 1952, and resulted in a ROCA victory with complete destruction of PLA forces. However ROCA later abandoned this island and retreated, with all its captured prizes and POWs, to Taiwan.  Introduction  Stele at Taiwushan Martyrs' Shrine on Kinmen (Quemoy) mentioning the Battle of Nanri Island () left With the Korean War erupting in the 1950s, the USA resumed military and financial support for the ROC military, whereby the ROCA acquired training and equipment from USA. One of the most important military breakthroughs for the ROCA was to gain more advanced amphibious warfare knowledge and skills, as well as more advanced mechanised armed forces. For the ROC, receiving assistance from USA was not just a commitment on its part, yet equally meant that the ROC was required to fulfil its own commitment with regards to the USA's support. The best manner in which to proceed with this was to utilise this acquired military knowledge and weaponry in an actual military situation. In 1952, large scale confrontation between People's Volunteer Army and the forces of the United Nations began in Korea. In order to divert the attention of China from the Korean front, in addition to check on the result of its military assistance to the forces of the ROC, the USA decided to initiate military action along the south-eastern coast line of China. The plan was laid down by Western Enterprises Inc (WEI), a \\"private\\" company in Taiwan which it was assumed pertained to, and under the direct control of, the CIA. The company was responsible for intelligence gathering along the coast of China. After having gathered a sizeable amount of evidence, the plan was to attack the Nanri Island during the duty takeover time period of the PLA, as there would have been only a single company of about 300 soldiers left on the island; a negligible strength of troops which would be capable to mount a successful and effective defence. The plan was only made known to the first strike team of 75th division on October 9, and no special training was provided. On the night of October 9, Kinmen defence command ordered the ROCA's 75th division (commander Wan Kuan-Yao) to load the landing craft under the cover of darkness. On 10 October 1952, before dawn, the 75th division and a few soldiers of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army(ACNSA), divided amongst three Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT), and about ten landing crafts landed on Nanri Island. During the battle, the PLA sent two battalions and two companies of reinforcements from the mainland, consisting of over 1'000 soldiers to Nanri Island. Most of the PLA's reinforcements consisted of raw recruits with no previous experience and possessing limited training; significantly limiting their combat skills and effectiveness. The raid failed, largely because the civilian junks the guerillas used as amphibious lift dropped the troops too far at sea and left them stranded there. The Nationalists were forced to withdraw on 14 October.[High Seas Buffer: The Taiwan Patrol Force, 1950-1979 By Bruce A. Elleman p60 Naval War College Newport Papers 2012] According to the ROCA, the withdrawal of troops began on 13 October 1952, yet official statement from the ROC would suggest that the withdrawal of troops actually began two days later on October 15. Given that the plan of the invasion was not to actually occupy the island, but to divert the attention of China from the Korean War, in addition to testing the newly acquired military capability from the USA, the ROCA withdrew from the island. On 22 October 1952, the prisoners of war of the PLA were sent to Kaohsiung, and later sent to Taipei. And few months after the Nanri Island battle, ROCA again won another battle at nearby Meizhou Island .  Aftermath  Location of Nan-jih Tao (Nanri Island) (1962) ROCA seized over 1000 assault rifles, 60 light machine guns and 40 over mortars and other equipment. Over 1000 livestocks, over a 1.4 tonnes of food supply were also seized and various other items such as furniture and clothings were also seized. Nanri Island postal charg√© d'affaires Zhang Yuzhen (Chang Yu-chen; ) was taken prisoner by the ROCA along with the all of the three yuan stamps, six yuan money orders, and five jiao tax stamps. Fuzhou military complex have undergone major structural changes, improved training and procured more advanced equipments. The result of these actions is the victory of the Dongshan Island Campaign happened the following year.

Rapola hill fort () is a hill fort in S√§√§ksm√§ki in the municipality of Valkeakoski, Finland. Its walls have circled an area of 58 000 square meters and it is the biggest hill fort found in Finland.leftIn 1921 senator and archaeologist Julius Ailio raised the question in his article if the fort had been the main fort of Tavastians. This view has also faced criticism later. According to excavations, the fort seems to have been in operation at least during the 13th and 15th centuries. This timing gives the postulation that it was built by the inhabitants in their struggles against invading Novgorodians and Swedes. Parts of it may be even earlier, since the area has been inhabited already in the 7th century. In excavations there have been found 80 depressions that have been interpreted as a place of residence and 13 places of hearths. Only one percent of the area of the hill fort has been excavated. A Papal Bull from 1340 mentions a person named Cuningas de Rapalum (King of Rapala) in a list of peasants who refused to pay taxes to the Catholic Church. The medieval S√§√§ksm√§ki church is located nearby, and the oldest signs of farming in Finland (dated 200 BCE) is also found there. The fort was partly constructed on a natural hill that was eventually entirely fortified. Remains of the earth walls are still visible. The fort was 400 meters long and 200 meters wide.

It was established in 1981 as the Mattara Poetry Prize. The Prize began from humble beginnings in September 1980, when Peter Goldman stood in the middle of Civic Park during the Mattara Festival and handed out an anthology of poetry to passers-by. The A4 photocopied collection featured poems from local Hunter writers, with contributors ranging in age from six to eighty-one. This anthology prompted two lecturers at the University of Newcastle, Christopher Pollnitz and Paul Kavanagh, to seek funding for a poetry competition which paved the way for the first official Mattara Poetry Prize in 1981. This prize gone on to become one of the richest and most prestigious poetry competitions in the country, and is now known as the Newcastle Poetry Prize. Today the Prize is one of the major events of the literary calendar in Australia, bringing entries from across the nation. More recently the Newcastle Poetry Prize has included a New Media prize, creating a forum for the new technology poets in the country. Initially sponsored by the Hunter Water Board, Newcastle City Council has provided funding via its Community Assistance Program since 1995, and the University of Newcastle has partnered with Council since 2004 to provide additional sponsorship. In 2011, the Prize celebrated its 30th anniversary and marked the milestone with readings by distinguished previous winners including Les Murray, Anthony Lawrence, Mark Tredinnick, Diane Fahey, Philip Salom, Duncan Hose, Patricia Sykes, Peter Kirkpatrick and Brooke Emery.

His business partner at Quebec was Colin Drummond, father of General Sir Gordon Drummond. Jordan held lands in New Brunswick and Vermont. He expanded into the grain trade and also became agent for the Saint-Maurice ironworks. In 1767, he married Ann Livingston; they had ten children. In 1776, he was named deputy paymaster general. In 1784, he purchased the seigneury of Terrebonne, which included gristmills valuable to Jordan for the production of flour, from Pierre-Paul Margane de Lavaltrie. He was also partner in the operation of a tobacco factory, the Montreal Distilling Company and a bakery at Montreal. He also became involved in the fur trade, in competition with the North West Company. Jordan represented Effingham County in the 1st Parliament of Lower Canada. He died at Saint-Louis-de-Terrebonne (later Terrebonne) in 1796, while still in office. His son Jacob represented Effingham in the legislative assembly from 1796 to 1800.

Early life Tamony was born at home in San Francisco, California, to Irish immigrants. He attended a parochial school at St. Peter's Church, and learned Latin and rhetoric from the progressive Father Peter Yorke, a supporter of modernizing the church, organized labor, and Irish independence. In 1905, Tamony's family bought a flat at 2876 24th Street in the Mission District where he lived for eighty years until his death at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital. Interest in language Tamony first became interested in etymology when he noticed various speech patterns. At the age of 20, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and couldn't participate in sports; this led him to pay close attention to sports in newspapers, and from there to analyzing how people used words. His sources eventually included any kind of material he could collect such as posters and blues records. He later became a real estate broker and notary, but for more than 50 years, Tamony collected examples of language, storing hundreds of cardboard cartons with file cards, newspaper clippings, conversation notes, and literature quotations. Folklorist Archie Green reminisced about the late Tamony as his mentor: \\"I look back at Peter Tamony as a keeper of a Celtic clan's lore, a bard in a magic three- storied castle - not in legendary Erin, but rather in San Francisco's Mission District.\\" Legacy On April 8, 1986, Kathleen Tamony donated her brother's collection to the University of Missouri.

The eastern Roman Empire and Bulgaria following the death of Basil I the Macedonian, circa AD 890.  Origins of the conflict  In 894 a war broke out between Bulgaria and Byzantium after the decision of Emperor Leo VI the Wise, to implement a request of his father-in-law, basileopater Stylianos Zaoutzes, to move the center of the Balkan trade activities from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, turned out inducing higher tariffs on Bulgarian trade. So Bulgaria's Tsar Simeon I defeats the Byzantines near Adrianople, before the year is over. But then the Byzantines turn to their standard method for handling such situations: they bribe a third party to assist, and on this case, they hire the Magyars of the Etelk√∂z State to attack Danube Bulgaria from the northeast. The Magyars cross the Danube in 895, and are victorious over the Bulgars twice. So Simeon withdraws to Durostorum, which he successfully defends, while during 896 he finds some assistance for his side, persuading the usually Byzantine-friendly Pechenegs to help him out. Then, while the Pechenegs began to combat the Magyars on their eastern frontier, Simeon and his father Boris I, the former tsar who left his monastery retreat to assist his heir in the occasion, gather an enormous army and march to the north to defend their empire.  The battle  Simeon ordered three days of fasting, saying that the soldiers should repent for their sins and seek help in God. When this was done, the battle began. It was long and unusually fierce but in the end the Bulgarians were victorious.Runciman, A history of the First Bulgarian Empire, p. 147, .Annales Fuldenses, p. 413Harimannus Augiensis, p. 111  Aftermath  The victory allowed Simeon to lead his troops to the south where he decisively defeated the Byzantines in the battle of Boulgarophygon. The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI's death in 912, and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tributeRunciman, p. 148 in exchange for the return of allegedly 120,000 captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians.Treadgold, p. 464 Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and Strandzha to the Bulgarian Empire,Zlatarski, pp. 318‚Äì321 while the Bulgarians also promised not to invade Byzantine territory.Zlatarski, p. 317  Footnotes   Sources  * Sources   –ô–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –ú–∏–ª—á–æ –õ–∞–ª–∫–æ–≤, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ, –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ –¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–æ, 1996.

Essentially, the fourth cylinder came from grafting on an extra middle crankcase unit; but since the primary chaincase and final drive sprocket could not be relocated, the fourth cylinder protruded on the right hand side of the bike. The top speed was reputedly 125 mph. Quite why Hele developed this motorcycle is something of a mystery, as the lopsided machine could never have reached production to compete with modern Japanese machines such as the Honda CB750 or the Kawasaki Z1. An inside view is that Hele's efforts in building the Quadrant was a waste of precious resources that (given NVT's precarious status) should have been directed elsewhere, such as getting the 900 cc triple \\"Thunderbird III\\" to market sooner.\\"BSA - Born 1861, Died 1973\\" Bill Murray July 1984 The National Motorcycle Museum in the UK and Roy Bacon, the author of \\"Triumph Twins and Triples\\", hold a different opinion of the Triumph Quadrant prototype than the above posting: TRIUMPH 4 CYLINDER 1000cc PROTOTYPE .....the Experimental Department under Doug Hele and based at Kitts Green, looked ahead for a successor (to the Trident) and built this interesting four cylinder prototype which just had to be nicknamed \\"The Quadrant\\". The crankcase was made by machining two triple cases and then welding them together before the final machining was done. The cylinder block, the head and camboxes were all produced in the same way, but the crankshaft was built up and the camshafts specially made and carried cams with mild timing. Most other parts were from the triple or twin suitably modified where necessary. It pulled a top gear of 4.2 to 1 and ran to nearly 125mph with the mild cams. (Courtesy \\"Triumph Twins and Triples\\" by Roy Bacon). Only one was made but as a piece of ingenious and highly skilled engineering, it would be hard to beat.

This family of worms is unusual in that new variants are being produced at an unprecedented rate, estimated to be up to one every 30 minutes at its peak, and downloaded from remote servers by infected machines to speed propagation. This makes detection and removal a particular challenge for anti-virus software vendors, because new signature files for each variant need to be issued to allow their software to detect them. Details The first variant of the Stration family was reported in late September 2006. It was quickly discovered that the worm program, as well as propagating itself by sending out copies via e-mail, was downloading new variants from one of a number of remote servers. These variants were generated by a program on those servers under control of the worm's creator(s). Computer security firm F-Secure has worked with ISPs to shut down domains hosting the variants of the worm. In November 2006, the Stration worm was the most widespread malware infection reported, accounting for around one-third of reported infections. The Stration worms employ social engineering to infect the target machine by arriving in an e-mail masquerading as a report from a mail server informing the recipient (in somewhat broken English) that their computer is infected due to an unpatched security flaw in Windows, and offering as an attachment a purported fix, which is in fact the worm program itself. Some later variants of the worm spread via instant messenger and Skype chat alerts containing a URL leading to the worm.

(the acronym stands for Soft Hard Real-time Kernel) is a completely configurable kernel architecture designed for supporting hard, soft, and non real-time applications with interchangeable scheduling algorithms. Main features The kernel architecture's main benefit is that an application can be developed independently from a particular system configuration. This allows new modules to be added or replaced in the same application, so that specific scheduling policies can be evaluated for predictability, overhead and performance. Applications S.Ha.R.K. was developed at RETIS Lab, a research facility of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, and at the University of Pavia, as a tool for teaching, testing and developing real-time software systems. It is used for teaching at many universities, including the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and Malardalens University in Sweden. Modularity Unlike the kernels in traditional operating systems, S.Ha.R.K. is fully modular in terms of scheduling policies, aperiodic servers, and concurrency control protocols. Modularity is achieved by partitioning system activities between a generic kernel and a set of modules, which can be registered at initialization to configure the kernel according to specific application requirements.

The Lautoka Indian Communal seat became vacant in April 1984 following the resignation of the former leader of the NFP, Jai Ram Reddy. When a supporter of Sidiq Koya from Ba, Dr Balwant Singh Rakkha, was selected to contest the by-election by the NFP, Davendra Singh, who was a virtual unknown, saw his chance at political glory. He managed to persuade the NFP Youth Wing, which had earlier been shunned by Koya, to support him to oppose Rakkha. He demanded that a local person be selected by NFP for the vacant seat but when he was ignored by the Party, he nominated himself for the election. (The by-election was delayed due to damage caused by a hurricane.) He had the support of the former Flower faction and also claimed Reddy's support. For his part, Reddy did not openly campaign for either candidate. During the campaign, Koya turned the election into a referendum on himself, and threatened to resign if Rakkha lost. The result was a narrow win for Singh by 2209 votes to Rakkha's 2196 votes in an election in which only 4421 of the 12,260 registered voters cast their votes. Koya did not go ahead with his threat to resign but challenged the results in the Supreme Court of Fiji, which confirmed Singh's election. The election result triggered a series of events which led to the decline of the NFP and the rise of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP). For a while, Singh sat as an independent member in the House of Representatives, but in September 1985 he attempted to merge the NFP Youth Wing with the newly formed Fiji Labour Party, which the FLP refused because it would not allow group affiliation. Finally in July 1986 he joined the FLP. He contested the 1987 election as an FLP endorsed candidate and easily won the North Western National seat. He was one of the parliamentarians taken captive during the coup of 1987. He has since migrated to New Zealand and runs a catering business in Auckland.

Following her model boyfriend to Paris in the late 1980s, she was discovered dancing in a Parisian night club, and was soon offered a recording contract. Early musical career She worked with the producer Orlando, brother of French superstar Dalida, and released her d√©but single Let's Go Crazy in late 1990. Very much in the current club/house-style, the song was a rap track, and crossed over from the underground to the mainstream, appearing at #11 in the French single chart. In 1991 Indra's second single, the dance song Misery hit #7 in France. It was written and produced by Eddy Beatboxking aka Walter Taieb, with lyrics by American songwriter Cathy Grier. The song remains Indra's biggest hit to date. This was followed by another Top 10 track, Temptation written and produced by Walter Taieb, and her debut album also called \\"Temptation\\" later in the year (also lyrics by Cathy Grier). The album went Gold in France and was later released in some foreign countries but Indra never managed to get success outside France. The album's fourth and last single was released in early 1992, and the song, Tell Me, was a Top 20 hit. In autumn 1992, Indra released Gimme What's Real, the first single from her second album. The single peaked at #16 in the French single chart, becoming Indra's 5th consecutive Top 20 hit. At that time, Indra was very popular in France and managed to establish herself as the 'Queen Of Dance Music' with a big club impact in addition to her chart success. She was the opening act for Prince's concert in Paris in July 1992. When Indra's second album, \\"Together Tonight\\", was released in January 1993, it also went Gold in France. After a collection of dance singles, Indra surprisingly released the ballad Rescue Me as her sixth single, it reached #38 in France. A third single from the \\"Together tonight\\" album was released later in 1993, Yesterday Is History (Tomorrow is a mystery) but it did not manage to chart in the Top 50 despite a bunch of new remixes. After only two albums, 1994 saw the release of a \\"Best Of\\" collection, which yielded two brand new singles, Hollywood and Save My Life. Both failed to make the French Top 50, but the album again reached Gold status. DJ Bobo and Masterboy produced her third studio album, \\"Anywhere\\", which was released in July 1995. The album was also released in Germany where DJ Bobo is a huge superstar. Both the album and its two singles, Anywhere and We Belong Together did not chart high. Anywhere was though a Top 20 dance hit in the French official club play chart. In 1995, Indra also participated on the Dalida remix album \\"Comme si j'√©tais l√†\\". She did a rap on the track Jusqu'au bout du r√™ve... which is a remake of the classic Dalida disco anthem Laissez-moi danser (Monday, Tuesday). The song was planned to be released as a single and a video made of archive footages from Dalida mixed with images of Indra's Gimme what's real video was even shown on TV but the song remained only available on promo CD and 12\\". After a break of two years, Indra returned in 1997 with the single Message for you but it also flopped. Later musical career After some TV hosting work in France on the channel France 3 on the show Ce soir, je passe √† la t√©l√© in 1998; Indra returned to the music industry in 1999 with her fourth studio album, \\"You & Me\\". The lead single Never never spent only one week (#99) in the French single Top 100! The album was a complete failure in terms of sales and no other single was released from that album. However, another single in summer 1999 saw her teamed up with Michael Damian from The Young and the Restless, but the song, Reggae Life, became a further addition to her string of flops totally missing the Top 100. Indra's recording contract was over at the end of 1999. She married model Guy Paillard, moved to Switzerland, and had a son, Ollie, in 2000. Indra returned to music in 2004. Still produced by Orlando, she started to sing in French in order to get more radio airplays on the French territory. Her come-back single was the pop/rock song Besoin De Vous, a duet with Frederic Lerner. The track made the French top 50 (#47), and for the first time saw Indra enter the official Swiss singles chart. Then, in 2005, she released her 'real' solo come-back single with Oublie-Moi, a pop/R'n'B track penned by Trag√©die who had a string of Top 10 hits in France. With that song, Indra found herself back in the French Top 40 (the song peaked at #39). In 2006, Indra appeared in the French version of reality show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! - Je suis une c√©l√©brit√©, sortez-moi de l√†!. While still in the show, a new single was released in April 2006 called Sois beau et tais-toi which reached number 16 in France and made Indra's return in the Top 20 after 14 years. She also released a self-titled album which included her last three singles, some of her biggest hits from the early 1990s and a couple of brand new songs. However the album did not sell very well reaching number 63 on the official French album chart. Throughout her career, Indra sold more than one million records in France and is in the Top 500 of the best-selling artists of all time in France. 2009 Come back and first steps as a Stage Actress Indra made a surprising come back in January 2009 as a stage actress in the comedy \\"Ma femme est folle\\" at the 'Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s' in Paris, alongside Georges Beller, Steevy Boulay and Sonia Dubois. The first night was on January, 10 and performances were planned until the end of February, but due to the success of the play, performances had been extended until June. In early 2009, it was also announced that Indra had recorded a full new album to be released in April called \\"One Woman Show\\". The album includes 12 tracks in English of dance-electro-pop. Including \\"Move In Time\\" co written by UK's queen of dance Tara McDonald. Because of the success of \\"Ma femme est folle\\", the release of the album was first postponed to June, and then to September. In the meantime, \\"Upper hand (sexy mama)\\", the first single, was sent to the medias but due to the radios' lack of enthusiasm, the album was once more delayed and a new release date in November was announced. Finally, the album was made available for digital download only on 7 December. After one more delay, the physical release was finally available on 8 February 2010. The album suffered a total lack of promotion and did not reach the French album chart (Top 200). In June 2010, \\"High heels and backwards\\" has been announced to be the second single from \\"One woman show\\". Promos have been sent to radios and the song was remixed by 2FrenchGuys. However, the song did not make any impact on charts or radios. In October 2010, Indra confirmed that she would be part of the tour \\"Dance Machine - La tourn√©e des ann√©es 90\\", a series of concerts throughout France to celebrate the 1990s with 90's artists such as Gala, Corona, Worlds Apart, Larusso, Black Box and Benny B among others. Indra performed one or two songs (including her biggest hit \\"Misery\\") during each concert. A dozen of dates were planned in France's biggest towns from March 2011 and due to the success of the tour, more dates were announced from December 2011. Indra also announced that she is continuing her stage actress career and that she had the lead female role in another comedy \\"Le clan des c√©libataires\\". Performances are planned throughout France from October 2011 until June 2012. Indra was replaced by \\"Plus belle la vie\\" actress, L√©a Fran√ßois, during the December performances so that she can be on stage for the \\"Dance machine\\" tour. She also had the leading role in an episode of the French docufiction TV series \\"Le jour o√π tout a bascul√©\\" which aired on France 2 in April 2012. On 20 May 2013 Indra released a new single, a cover version of the track \\"It's on you\\" originally released by MC Sar & the Real McCoy in 1990. Several mixes of the single are available for download and a music video was also filmed. This is the first time that Indra released a song that is not produced by Orlando and the track has been released under a new music label. In September 2013, she teamed up with David Stephan on his single \\"Feel my love\\" and has started to tour throughout France in her third play, a new adaptation of the classic \\"Ma femme s'appelle Maurice\\".

The storm began when a surface low-pressure system moved northward through the eastern Gulf of Mexico and up the Fall Line east of the Appalachians, leading to a snowstorm from the central Gulf coast northward into Tennessee. Three people perished during the storm, and travel was severely restricted for a couple of days following the snowfall. The strong winds accompanied by heavy snow fall set historic new snowfall records in Alabama. Synoptic history A shortwave in the southern stream of the Westerlies closed off as it approached the central United States Gulf of Mexico coastline. A surface cyclone formed in the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico, slowly deepening as it moved north-northeast across the eastern Gulf. Cold air was residing across the Deep South in advance of this system, and as the surface cyclone tracked across northern Florida, heavy snowfall fell in its comma head from the Mouth of the Mississippi River northeast through Mississippi and Alabama into Tennessee, where the snow persisted into January 1. The cyclone ultimately moved along the east coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada, moving out into the far north Atlantic as a strengthening storm.

This cross- Government initiative also involved the co-operation and partnership of data suppliers across departments, agencies and other organisations. The ONS closed the Neighbourhood Statistics website for England and Wales on the 12 May 2017. To offset this, the ONS is aiming to meet the needs of users via the ONS website, although direct postcode searches are no longer available to users. The Scottish Government continues to provide local statistics via Statistics.Gov.Scot and Census area profiles. Neighbourhood statistics for Northern Ireland continue to be made available from the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service (NINIS). Purpose The need for Neighbourhood Statistics can be traced back to the Social Exclusion Unit's 1998 report on deprived neighbourhoods. The absence of information about neighbourhoods produced a series of failings at all levels, with policy makers unaware of the scale and location of problems but when small area information is collected and made easily available, it can radically improve strategies and service delivery. Resource NeSS provided a powerful platform through which high quality small area data for England and Wales was disseminated to an expanding audience.

He is best remembered for his portrayal of Scott Carey in the science fiction film The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). Early life Born in New York City to a Scottish father and an Irish mother, Williams began acting in summer stock as a child. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving from 1948 to 1952, before and during the Korean War. He was discharged as an Air Force staff sergeant. It would seem that Williams attended one or more colleges after his Air Force stint, but the sources are deeply discordant about which. He had, in fact, enrolled in Queens College, Flushing, New York, but cut his attendance short when he enlisted. Among the universities cited by the various sources are: the University of Illinois, City College of New York, Columbia University, and New York University. According to Rual Askew of the Dallas Morning News, who interviewed Williams in March 1957 and published a profile of the actor,Rual Askew (R.A.), \\"Top Star Contender Ready for Whatever is Demanded,\\" Dallas Morning News, March 5, 1957. Williams earned a B.A. in Journalism from New York University. According to other press sources (such as a February 1959 syndicated article in the Daily Herald of Provo, Utah),\\"TV Star Rises from Stinker To Thinker Actor,\\" Provo (UT) Daily Herald, February 2, 1959 (probably United Press International). Williams obtained a degree in journalism from a correspondence school. Career After his Air-Force service, he enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York CityAccording to Stampalia's biography of Williams, the Actors Studio, when queried about the issue, could not find evidence of Williams' attendance. See Stampalia (2018), op. cit., p. 22. under Lee Strasberg. Williams' early theatrical experience was intensive, but, contrary to what several Internet sourcesThat Williams had been a \\"Broadway\\" actor was stated not only by earlier versions of this Wikipedia article, but also by his IMDb biography, as well as by several press mentions during Williams' times and by the Universal-International pressbooks for The Incredible Shrinking Man and other films. (and Williams himself)Richard Lamparski, Whatever Became of...?, Crown Publishers, Inc., 1982, p. 292. have stated, never included Broadway. His work in the theater was all \\"off-Broadway,\\" at prestigious venues such as the Barter Theatre of Abingdon, Virginia (1953), and the Blackfriars Theatre in New York (1953).Stampalia (2018), op. cit., pp. 21-51. Following small roles on television, Williams was spotted by a talent scout on Kraft Television Theater in 1954, and signed with Universal Pictures in March 1955. He made his film debut in Jack Arnold's Red Sundown in March of the following year, in the small but memorable bravura role of hired thug Chet Swann. This film was followed by another picture directed by Arnold, the noir thriller Outside the Law (1956), by the western Showdown at Abilene (1956), by some small uncredited roles, and by the middling CinemaScope romantic comedy Four Girls in Town (1957). In his most memorable role,Though the role of Robert Scott Carey is undoubtedly Williams' best performance, and his most memorable, one should at least cite two other roles as second-best: Greg Banister in the thoughtful western Lone Texan (1959) and Charles Campbell in the Warner Bros. thriller The Couch (1962); one should also cite his best television role, that of Greg MacKenzie in the extraordinary Hawaiian Eye episode entitled \\"Nightmare in Paradise\\" (April 1962). See Stampalia (2018), op. cit., pp. 215-22, 244-55, and 263-76, respectively. Williams starred as Scott Carey in his seventh film, the Hugo Award-winning science fiction film The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), with Randy Stuart playing his wife, Louise. Despite good reviews and the success of the film, his career continued with only lackluster roles. Universal Pictures dropped his contract in 1959,Williams' contract actually expired sometime in 1957, for in 1959 he was making two films for Associated Producers Incorporated/20th Century Fox: Lone Texan (1959) and 13 Fighting Men (1960). and he signed in 1960 with Warner Brothers, where he had a continuing role as the private detective Greg McKenzie on Hawaiian Eye, co-starring Robert Conrad, Anthony Eisley, and Connie Stevens. Several film and television roles followed, including playing Col. Geo. Custer on the show Yancy Derringer, and the role of the psychopathic killer in Robert Bloch's The Couch (1962), but fame still eluded him. He made two guest appearances on Perry Mason in 1964 as columnist and murderer Quincy Davis in \\"The Case of the Ruinous Road\\", and defendant Dr. Todd Meade in the 1965 episode \\"The Case of the Baffling Bug\\". He starred as troubled military psychologist Major Douglas McKinnon in The Outer Limits episode \\"The Brain of Colonel Barham\\" along with former Hawaiian Eye co-star Anthony Eisley. Also in 1965, Williams played the title character (Albert \\"Patch\\" Saunders) in the Bonanza episode \\"Patchwork Man,\\" as well as the 1960 episode \\"Escape to Ponderosa\\". Williams attempted a comedic role on the radio airwaves in the anthology program Family Theater (September 11, 1957, the show's last episode), and there was some light-heartedness to his delightful role as Mike Carter in the half-hour episode \\"Millionaire Gilbert Burton\\" (April 29, 1959) of the series The Millionaire. As his acting career declined, he opened a dramatics school in West Hollywood. According to earlier versions of this article, he also wrote several books on acting, though his acting students never mention them in the extensive interviews included in Stampalia's biography,Stampalia (2018), op. cit., pp. 327-33. and there appears to be no trace of their publication. Williams continued to act occasionally in both movies and television, but without much conviction and in inferior products. His last released film appearance was in Doomsday Machine (1972); however, as it was actually shot in 1969, Brain of Blood (1972) was his last acting work for the screen. His last TV appearance was in 1983 on the game show Family Feud along with other former cast members from Hawaiian Eye. Life and death Williams died on July 28, 1985, of peritonitis at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles and was buried in the Los Angeles National Cemetery. Williams never married but was survived by a brother. He was a cousin, or rather great-nephew,The press sources of Williams' times variously described Garden as Williams' cousin, aunt, or distant relative; Williams often referred to her as his aunt, most notably in a personal letter. See Stampalia (2018), op. cit., pp. 6-7, 235-37. of Scottish opera singer Mary Garden.

Born in Ballyglass, County Galway, Lane first played competitive hurling whilst at school in Our Lady's College, Gort. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-two when he made his senior debut with Galway in the 1977‚Äì78 National Hurling League. Lane went on to play a key role for Galway for more than a decade, and won three All-Ireland medals and two National Hurling League medals. He was an All- Ireland runner-up on five occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter- provincial team at various times, Lane won five Railway Cup medals. At club level he played with Ballinderreen. Throughout his career Lane made 22 championship appearances for Galway. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1990 championship. Lane is widely regarded as one of Galway's greatest-ever hurlers. He has often been voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at left corner-forward on the Galway Hurling Team of the Millennium. In retirement from playing, Lane became involved in team management and coaching. During a two-year term as manager of the Galway senior hurlers, he guided the team to an All-Ireland final appearance. Playing career College Lane attended Our Lady's College in Gort, however, he found it difficult to break onto the school's senior hurling team. During his tenure Our Lady's College won four consecutive Connacht titles, however, Lane's side were defeated by St. Peter's College, Wexford in the All- Ireland decider in 1973. Club Lane enjoyed much success at juvenile and underage levels with Ballinderreen, winning south championship medals in the under-14, under-16 and under-21 grades. In 1978 Lane was one of the key forwards as Ballinderreen reached the senior championship decider for the first time in over forty years. Ardrahan provided the opposition with the game ending in stalemate. The subsequent replay also ended in a draw, however, a period of extra-time saw Ardrahan win by 2‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì14. Inter-county Lane made his senior inter-county debut on 9 October 1977 in a 4‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì10 defeat by Clare in the opening round of the National Hurling League. He was subsequently included on the starting fifteen for Galway's unsuccessful championship campaign. In 1979 Galway later shocked four-in-a-row hopefuls Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final and qualified for an All-Ireland final showdown with Kilkenny. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Tipperary-born Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Lane's side as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8. In spite of this defeat Lane's goal in the final was named goal of the year. In 1980 Galway defeated Kildare and Offaly to reach a second consecutive All-Ireland final. Munster champions Limerick provided the opposition on this occasion and an exciting championship decider followed. Lane nearly didn't make it to the throw-in after he was accidentally hit by in the head by a hurley running out onto the pitch, however, his injury was stitched up and he played a full part. Bernie Forde and P. J. Molloy goals for Galway meant that the men from the west led by 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì5 at half-time. √âamonn Cregan single-handedly launched the Limerick counter-attack in the second- half. Over the course of the game he scored 2‚Äì7, including an overhead goal and a point in which he showed the ball to full-back Conor Hayes and nonchalantly drove the ball over the bar. It was not enough to stem the tide and Galway went on to win the game by 2‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì9. It was Galway's first All- Ireland title since 1923, with Lane picking up a winners' medal and the celebrations surpassed anything ever seen in Croke Park. 1981 saw Galway reach a third consecutive All-Ireland final and Offaly were the opponents. Everything seemed to be going well for Lane's side as Galway hoped to capture a second consecutive All-Ireland title. Offaly 'keeper Damien Martin was doing great work in batting out an almost certain Galway goal early in the second- half. With twenty-three minutes left in the game Galway led by six points, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Johnny Flaherty hand- passed Offaly's second goal with just three minutes remaining. At the long whistle Galway were defeated by 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì15. The next three seasons saw Galway exit the championship at the All-Ireland semi-final stage, however, Lane's reputation as Galway's top player was further enhanced when he collected back-to-back All-Star awards in 1983 and 1984. Galway shocked reigning All-Ireland champions Cork in the semi-final to reach the decider once again in 1985. Offaly provided the opposition in the subsequent All- Ireland final and another tense game ensued. Once again it was Offaly's goal- scoring ability that proved crucial. Pat Cleary scored the first of the day after twenty-five minutes of play and got his second less than half a minute after the restart. Joe Dooley had a goal disallowed halfway through the second-half while a long Joe Cooney effort, which seemed to cross the goal line, was not given. P. J. Molloy was Galway's goal scorer, however, the day belonged to Offaly. A 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 score line resulted in defeat for Galway. Galway reached a second successive All-Ireland decider again in 1986, with Lane serving as team captain for the year. The men from the west were the red- hot favourites against an ageing Cork team, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped \\"the Rebels\\" to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. Lane won his first National Hurling League medal in 1987 when he was strung from the bench in the 3‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì10 league decider defeat of Clare. Later that summer Galway qualified for a third All-Ireland final in-a-row. The prospect of becoming the first team to lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team as Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was not a classic by any standard, however, Lane, who started the game on the sideline and was introduced as a substitute, got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. A 1‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì9 victory gave him a second All-Ireland medal. In 1988 Galway reached a fourth successive All-Ireland final and were favourites to retain the title. After more than a decade-and-a-half in the wilderness Tipperary were back providing the opposition in the championship decider. Galway defeated Tipp in the semi-final the previous year, however, with an extra year's experience it was expected that Tipperary might shade the victory. Galway used this to motivate themselves. After returning to form throughout the year, there was some surprise when Lane was dropped from the starting fifteen. He was introduced as a substitute once again and scored a crucial goal while Nicky English sent a late penalty over the bar for a point. A 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì14 score line resulted in victory for Galway and a third All-Ireland medal for Lane. Lane retained his reputation as a super sub in 1989 and collected a second National League medal that year after being introduced mid-way during the 2‚Äì16 to 4‚Äì8 defeat of Tipperary. For the third time in as many years both sides later met in the All-Ireland series, however, on this occasion the men from the West were controversially without their star player Tony Keady. The game turned out to be a tense and unsavory affair as Tipp finally triumphed over Galway. A 1‚Äì17 to 2‚Äì11 victory for the Munster men meant that Galway's three- in-a-row dream was over. In 1990 Lane was thirty-five years of age and was regarded as the veteran of the Galway team. In spite of this he was at full- forward for his eighth appearance in an All-Ireland final. Cork were the opponents, however, Galway were the red-hot favourites as they set out to win a third championship in four years. Shortly after half-time the westerners were up by seven points and were cruising to victory. Cork were a changed team in the second half, with captain Tom√°s Mulcahy scoring a key goal that seemed to revitalise the team. The final score of 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21 brought a fifth All- Ireland final defeat for Lane. This defeat also brought the curtain down on his inter-county career. Inter-provincial Lane also lined out with Connacht in the inter-provincial series of games and enjoyed much success. In 1979 Lane was at right corner-forward as Connacht reached the inter-provincial decider. A 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 defeat by Leinster was the result on that occasion. Lane retained the same position on the team in 1980 as Connacht faced Railway Cup specialists Munster in the decider. A low-scoring game followed, however, a 1‚Äì5 to 0‚Äì7 victory gave Connacht their first Railway Cup title since 1947. It was Lane's first winners' medal in the inter-pro competition. Connacht reached the Railway Cup final again in 1982. A 3‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì9 victory over Leinster gave Lane his second Railway Cup medal. Defeat of the same opposition in 1983 allowed Connacht to retain the title for the first time in their history. After defeat to Munster in 1985, both sides renewed their rivalry in the inter-provincial decider again in 1986. A comprehensive 3‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì11 victory gave Lane, who was captain of the team, a fourth Railway Cup medal. In 1987 Connacht faced Leinster in the final once again. A narrow 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì14 victory to Connacht gave Lane a fifth and final Railway Cup medal. Managerial career Galway On 11 October 2000, Lane defeated incumbent Mattie Murphy by 33 votes to 21 to become manager of the Galway senior hurling team. In his opening season Lane's team surrendered their National League crown, however, a shock All-Ireland semi-final defeat of reigning champions Kilkenny propelled Galway to a championship showdown with old rivals Tipperary. Galway put it up to Tipp, however, two goals by Mark O'Leary gave the Munster men the threshold to withstand a Galway comeback. With nine minutes to go Galway were only a point in arrears, however, Tipperary outscored Galway by five to three in those closing minutes. At the final whistle Tipperary were the winners by 2‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì15. Galway exited the 2002 championship at the hands of Clare in the All-Ireland semi-final. This was Lane's last game in charge of Galway, however, he has been linked with a return to management on several occasions. Personal life Born in Ballyglass, County Galway, Lane was educated at the local national school before later attending Our Lady's College in Gort. He pursued his interest in forestry and agriculture at college in Athenry, Kinnity and Avondale. Lane subsequently became a regional manager for wood company Coillte.

He is considered one of the most important examples of the movement oppose to the Novecento Italiano. His masterpieces are exhibited all around the world. Biography De Felice was born in Torre Orsina, a small town on the hills around Terni. Of humble origins, he began his studies in contrast with his family at the Scuola Romana in the 1930s. He earned a degree at the Academy of Fine Arts of Rome, becoming a professor there. De Felice alternated lessons and artistic activity with many personal exhibitions. The most important in that period was the one in the Gallery of Rome, introduced by Renato Guttuso. At the end of the Second World War, De Felice started to travel across Europe. In those years he exhibited in Switzerland, Germany and France, where he created, in Paris, on behalf of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the School of Italian Art. There he met Pablo Picasso, Fernand L√©ger, Jean Cocteau, Kees van Dongen, Ossip Zadkine, Mark Tobey and Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. He did not allow himself to be involved in the big debate between realism and formalism in the 1950s, continuing on his own road. In 1961 De Felice created the Institute of Arts in Terni. In those years he continued to exhibit all over Europe (Italy, Germany, Switzerland, France). In 1967 he was in charge of the Italian Institute of Culture in Hamburg and the Center of Italian Studies in Zurich. In 1977 he was invited to the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, for a conference on Orneore Metelli, a \\"painter-shoemaker\\" from Terni, and father of the Na√Øve Italian movement, whose art had become famous thanks to De Felice's work. His last exhibition took place in 1982; after that, disease forced the sculptor to limit his activity. He spent the last years of his life in the quiet of his house on the hills of Torre Orsina, where he died on June 14, 1996. Bibliography * A. De Felice scultore (ed. Il Ponte; preface by Trombadori).

Life Malhiot was born Fran√ßois-Xavier-Amable Malhiot at Verch√®res, Quebec in 1781, the son of Fran√ßois Malhiot. Malhiot joined the Royal Canadian Volunteer Regiment as an officer and later became a lieutenant-colonel in the militia, serving during the War of 1812. In 1804, with one of his brothers, he took over the family business. In 1805, he married Julie Laperi√®re and inherited land in the seigneury of Contrecoeur after the death of his father-in-law in 1807; he became principal seigneur in 1818. In 1814, he purchased land in the seigneury of Saint-Ours. Malhiot was elected to represent Richelieu in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada in an 1815 by-election held after an earlier election was declared invalid. In 1828, he was elected for Surrey in a by-election held after Louis-Joseph Papineau, who had been elected in two different ridings, chose to sit for Montreal West. In 1828, Malhiot was dismissed from his position in the militia by Lord Dalhousie after he supported resolutions critical of the governor's behaviour. He was elected to represent Verch√®res (formerly Surrey) in 1830 but resigned his seat in 1832 after he was named to the Legislative Council.

B. Rounsevell and Alfred Simms). The Managing Directors of the new company were Robert Alfred Stock, Alfred Simms JP., and W. B. Rounsevell. Provisional directors were Sir. E. T. Smith, W. K. Simms, MLC., W. B. Rounsevell, MP., R. A. Stock, Alfred Simms, Charles H. T. Hart, and Frank Rymill of Adelaide, and Hon. N. Fitzgerald, MLC., John Robb, JP., M. D. McEacharn, John B. Watson, and John McIlwraith, of Melbourne. In 1927 T. A. Nation was the brewer and G. B. Bryant the general manager. His board of directors comprised S. J. Jacobs (later Managing Director), Sir Lancelot Stirling, K.C.M.G., Edward Fitzgerald, LL.D., and H. W. Morphett. The Torrenside Brewery at Southwark, (pronounced SUTH-uk, now part of Thebarton, pronounced THEB-uh-tun) on the banks of the River Torrens north-west of the city centre producing \\"Southwark\\" beers, was founded by A. W. & T. L. Ware in 1886 and became the Walkerville Cooperative Brewery in 1898. This business was taken over by the South Australian Brewing Company in 1938. The West End brewery was closed between the wars, and the operations consolidated with the Southwark brewery operations at the Thebarton site. According to legend, the black and red colours of the SA Brewing Company came about after the West Adelaide Football Club (whose colours are black and red) defeated Port Adelaide in the 1909 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) Australian rules football Grand Final.

A prominent factor in promoting this design revolution throughout industry was the DARPA-funded VLSI Project instigated by Mead and Conway which spurred development of electronic design automation.  Details  When the integrated circuit was originally invented and commercialized, the initial chip designers were co-located with the physicists, engineers and factories that understood integrated circuit technology. At that time, fewer than 100 transistors would fit in an integrated circuit \\"chip\\". The design capability for such circuits was centered in industry, with universities struggling to catch up. Soon, the number of transistors which fit in a chip started doubling every two years. Much more complex circuits could then fit on a single chip, but the device physicists who fabricated the chips were not experts in electronic circuit design, so their designs were limited more by their expertise and imaginations than by limitations in the technology. Professor Carver Mead, who popularized the term \\"Moore's law\\" for this doubling trend, called for a separation of design from technology throughout the 1970s. He discovered and taught simple design rules that did not vary in each new generation of semiconductors. Using these rules, circuit designs could be created that would create working chips despite the many variations in the fast-evolving semiconductor industry. Electronic design automation software translated these generic circuit designs to implement them in each semiconductor technology. In 1978‚Äì79, when approximately 20,000 transistors could be fabricated in a single chip, Carver Mead and Lynn Conway wrote the textbook Introduction to VLSI Systems. It was published in 1979 and became a bestseller, since it was the first VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design textbook usable by non-physicists. The authors intended the book to fill a gap in the literature and introduce electrical engineering and computer science students to integrated system architecture. This textbook triggered a breakthrough in education, as well as in industry practice. Computer science and electrical engineering professors throughout the world started teaching VLSI system design using this textbook. Many of them also obtained a copy of Lynn Conway's notes from her famous MIT course in 1978, which included a collection of exercises. An important milestone that followed was the Multi Project Chip (MPC) concept that allowed multiple designs to be fabricated on a single wafer, greatly reducing cost to the point that students' design exercises and prototypes could be fabricated (created) in small numbers. The first successful run of an MPC line was demonstrated at Lynn Conway's 1978 VLSI design course at MIT. A few weeks after completion of their designs, the students had the fabricated prototypes in their hands, available for testing. Lynn Conway's improved new Xerox PARC MPC VLSI implementation system and service was operated successfully for a dozen universities by late 1979. Danny Cohen (engineer) then transferred the technology to the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute, creating the Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS), which has evolved since 1981 into a national infrastructure for fast-turnaround prototyping of VLSI chip designs by universities and researchers. In 1980, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency began the DoD's new VLSI research project to support extensions of this work. This resulted in many university and industry researchers learning and improving the Mead-Conway innovations. They rapidly spread around the world. Many regional Mead & Conway scenes were organized, such as the German multi-university E.I.S. project.

The band was originally composed of members of two former bands, Agent Steel and Abattoir, including guitarist Juan Garcia, who is their only remaining original member. During their initial nine-year run, Evildead released only two studio albums: Annihilation of Civilization (1989) and The Underworld (1991). Although their commercial success was limited, their music is still highly regarded amongst metal fans. Evildead was plagued by extended inactivity due to lineup changes and problems with making a follow-up to The Underworld. This resulted in their official breakup in 1995. After a short- lived reunion from 2008 to 2012, the band reformed once again in 2016, and will release their third studio album United $tate$ of Anarchy, their first in 29 years, on October 30, 2020. History Formation and first two albums (1986‚Äì1992) Evildead was formed in 1986, initially as a side-project of Agent Steel guitarist Juan Garcia and Abattoir bassist Mel Sanchez, with the intention to write heavy music with more hardcore and thrash metal elements, more so than their bands at the time. Evildead paved new ground with their ferocious approach to songwriting, but also followed a style similar to that of several of their peers (including Testament, Vio-lence, Dark Angel and Sacred Reich), with lyrics exploring political and social themes mixed with humor, and horror and nuclear war topics. Their band name was inspired from the Sam Raimi horror film The Evil Dead. In 1988, the band signed a recording contract with the European label Steamhammer Records and released Rise Above (a 3-track EP featuring the songs \\"Sloe-Death\\", \\"Run Again\\" and the title track which is a cover version of the Black Flag song) in the following year. They followed it up with their debut full-length album Annihilation of Civilization (also released in 1989) to rave reviews. A music video was released for the title track, and it received airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In 1990, the band returned to the studio to record their second album with producer Warren Croyle, The Underworld, which was released in the following year. The album was not as successful as Annihilation of Civilization. They released a live album taken from the tour, Live...From The Depths of The Underworld, in 1992, but was their last release due to the grunge movement that was emerging at that time, which was displacing many forms of 1980s heavy metal and hard rock in America. Cancelled third album and breakup (1993‚Äì2007) Following The Underworld tour, Evildead went on an extended hiatus. The band headed back into the studio in 1993 to begin work on a third album, and wrote several new songs including \\"Humano\\", \\"Immortal\\" and \\"Dia de los Muertos\\", which also appear on the band's 1994 demo tape Terror and would be recorded again for the only Terror album Hijos de los Cometas (1997). However, the album was left unfinished and Evildead soon broke up. After the split, Karlos Medina, and Juan Garcia reformed Agent Steel, but still played together with ex-Evildead member Danny Flores, and Rigo Amezcua in a band called Terror, which has one full-length album; with all songs in Spanish that was released on BMG in Mexico; which is not out of print. Former drummer Joe Montelongo, although in the band for a short time, played on the European tour and is on the live release. He went on to play with MX Machine and East L.A. punk band The Brat. First reunion (2008‚Äì2012) In 2008, Evildead announced that they would reunite in the summer of 2009 for shows. They also began rehearsals for the Thrasho De Mayo event that was held in Los Angeles in May, 2010. The band also performed at the \\"Way of Darkness Festival\\" in Germany later that year. The current line up features new vocalist, Steve Nelson (Winterthrall, Noctuary), Rob Alaniz (original drummer), Albert Gonzalez (original guitarist), Mel Sanchez (original bassist), and Juan Garcia (original guitarist). By May 2011, Evildead had been writing new material for their what would be their third studio album. In addition, they posted a new track called \\"Blasphemy Divine\\", which was produced by George Pajon and is available for free download. The new album would have been Evildead's first album since 1991's The Underworld and the first new music from the band since writing and demoing songs for an unreleased album in 1993-1994. It would also have been the first Evildead album to feature the return of Albert Gonzalez on guitar, Mel S√°nchez on bass and Rob Alaniz on drums since 1989's Annihilation of Civilization as well as Steve Nelson's debut album with the band. Despite their plans to record a new studio album, it was announced on October 17, 2012 that Evildead had disbanded once again. Second reunion (2016‚Äìpresent) Evildead reunited once again for a one-off show on March 12, 2016 at the Love/Hate Rock Bar in Los Angeles, in celebration of the 50th birthday of drummer Rob Alaniz. In June 2016, Evildead confirmed that they were active once more. They also announced that they were recording new material, and planning to play some shows in 2017. By August 2017, Evildead had been in the studio finishing four tracks for the upcoming third album, which was being produced by Bill Metoyer. On September 23, 2017, the band premiered their first song in 26 years, \\"Word of God\\", on Los Anarchy Radio. Six days later, the band played their first show since reuniting the year before at the Union Club in Los Angeles. On February 11, 2018, Evildead announced on their Facebook page that their third album was \\"coming soon.\\" The album, entitled United $tate$ of Anarchy, will be released on October 30, 2020.

The area plays a \\"bridging role\\" between the Orchard area and the Downtown Core, which necessitates proper transport networks for vehicles, pedestrians and public transport. Due to the sheer size of green areas in the district, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has designated it a 'green lung' in the Central Area. However, the Museum Planning Area is also home to cultural and commercial activities. Around 65% of the area is available for future development, making it a hotbed for new infrastructure and buildings. Museum planning area is bounded by the planning areas of Newton and Rochor to the north, the Downtown Core to the southeast, Singapore River to the south, River Valley to the west and Orchard to the northwest. History Ten national monuments are located within the Museum Planning Area, namely the Armenian Church, the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd, Cathay Building (now The Cathay), the Central Fire Station, the House of Tan Yeok Nee, the MacDonald House, the Old Tao Nan School (Peranakan Museum), the National Museum of Singapore, the Old Hill Street Police Station and the Singapore Art Museum/Former Saint Joseph's Institution. The area is home to significant events such as the Battle of Singapore and MacDonald House bombing. Other historical sites include: *YMCA Building *National Theatre *United Chinese Library Geography The Museum Planning Area is bordered by Rochor to the northeast, the Downtown Core to the southeast, the Singapore River Area to the southwest, River Valley to the west and Newton and Orchard to the northwest. The area is roughly bounded by Hill Street, River Valley Road, Clemenceau Avenue and Bras Basah Road. It is the smallest urban planning area, with an area of 83 hectares. Parks and open spaces take up a third of the area of the Museum Planning Area, and include Fort Canning, Istana Park and Bras Basah Park, which can be used for recreational purposes. Collectively, these places will form the so-called 'green lung' of the Central Area. Terraces have been proposed to allow for \\"a more prominent and convenient access\\" to the Fort Canning area. Institutions The Museum Planning Area is Singapore's \\"institutional hub\\", with 11% of land set aside for institutional use and reserve sites to be safeguarded for future institutions. The many museums in the area, which give the Museum District its name, include the National Museum of Singapore, the Singapore Art Museum, the Asian Civilisations Museum, the National Archives of Singapore and the Singapore Philatelic Museum. The arts scene is vibrant in the area, with The Substation, the Singapore Calligraphy Centre, the YMS Arts Centre and the Singapore Dance Ensemble all located within its boundaries. Scattered throughout the area are places of worship such as churches, mosques, Hindu temples and synagogues. The Registry of Marriages and the sprawling Singapore Management University campus are also located in the area. Residential development Despite its prime location, residential projects were only allocated 1% of the land area, and the Museum Planning Area was criticised for lacking residential zoning. Due to the lack of residents, there were fears that the area would become a \\"ghost town\\" at night. Furthermore, the concept of living within the Central Area had gained popularity, and up-market skyscraper condominiums could be built. The greenery of the Museum Planning Area could provide a peaceful environment for living. The URA replied that several plots of land had been sold for residential-commercial mixed use, and that more housing developments were to be planned and constructed. The URA emphasised the importance of the area as a transition between the central business district and shopping areas, as well as the green, pedestrian- friendly nature of the URA's plan for the area. Commercial development The Museum Planning Area is home to various shopping malls, including Park Mall, Plaza Singapura, The Cathay, Singapore Shopping Centre and The Atrium @ Orchard. More vacant land will be set aside for commercial uses, especially around Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and Bras Basah MRT station. These will be properly integrated and connected with the respective stations. Hotels in the area include Bayview Hotel Singapore and Hotel Rendezvous. Furthermore, a hotel development at the foot of Fort Canning Hill near the junction of Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road is in the planning stages, and is meant to be a retreat from urban living \\"amidst lush greenery\\". Other developments are planned on reserved sites near Fort Canning, but details have not been released. Transport Bras Basah MRT station The Museum Planning Area is served by four Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations: Dhoby Ghaut, Bras Basah, Fort Canning and Bencoolen The North South Line and the North East Line can only be accessible from Dhoby Ghaut while the Circle Line can be accessible from both and the Downtown Line can be accessible from Fort Canning and Bencoolen. The Central Expressway's Chin Swee Tunnel also passes under the area. Roads Improvements Several changes to the road network in the area will be implemented, including the construction of Fort Canning Tunnel and the realignment of Stamford Road and Handy Road. The rationale for the improvements is increased traffic from Marina Centre and relieving the traffic congestion along Orchard Road. Furthermore, a new road network has been put in place to ensure smooth traffic flow after the full development of land around the MRT Stations. Major roads *Armenian Street *Bras Basah Road *Central Expressway *Clemenceau Avenue *Fort Canning Tunnel *Hill Street *Orchard Road *Queen Street *River Valley Road *Stamford Road *Victoria Street Pedestrian linkages The Development Guide Plan for the Museum Planning Area envisages \\"a comprehensive pedestrian network linking developments, parks and open spaces\\".

The East Merthyr Reclamation Scheme is made up of three phases, each with the objective of reclaiming the derelict and dangerous land to the east of Merthyr Tydfil, using revenues from surface coal mining operations, restoring the land to beneficial use at no cost to the public purse. Phases I 'Incline Top' and II the Dowlais'Great White Tip' of the Scheme were completed in 1993 and 1997 respectively, restoring 106ha of derelict land to provide residential, light industrial and recreational uses. The ‚ÄòFfos-y-fran Land Reclamation Scheme‚Äô, represents the third, and final, stage of the wider East Merthyr Reclamation Scheme. It is the largest of the original three phases and will restore over 360ha of previously derelict and disturbed land. Once completed, the land, which will be fit for upland grazing, with safe access for use by the community, will be returned to the Planning Authority. Planning Planning consent for Phase III was granted in November 1988. However, local debates continued over the nature and scale of the development which will lead to the extraction of 10 m tonnes of coal over 15 years; as well as commercial concerns over the size of the coal reserve, together with access rights to the land. Protesters said that if the scheme proceeded, it would mean work taking place just a few hundred metres away from homes in the villages of Dowlais, Mountain Hare, and Penydarren; some houses would be less than 40 m from the boundary of the site. In 1994 the scheme was revised to claim a larger coal reserve in line with government guidance, termed Phase IIIA. This was withdrawn in May 1999 due to access rights issues. Access rights were resolved by Miller Argent in 2003, and a new application was brought to Merthyr Council and the Welsh Assembly. In February 2005 the Welsh Assembly approved the Ffos- y-Fran scheme, but the High Court quashed the decision after it was claimed by local residents that Environment Minister Carwyn Jones had made his mind up before the planning committee met. Mr Jones denied the claim and the Welsh Assembly took the case to appeal judges, who gave final approval of the scheme on 27 November 2006. Scale The Ffos-y-fran Land Reclamation Scheme is the largest of the original three phases and will restore derelict land, including the removal of known shafts previously associated with iron ore and coal workings, to finally complete the original land reclamation scheme. Statistics surrounding the site which include: *Phase III in total covers of land *Since 2002 the Council have removed 58 burnt out and stolen cars from the site *200 people will be employed on the site, with an additional estimated 400 jobs created within the local area *The scheme at peak production will extract 20,000 tonnes of coal per week Transport Under agreed planning rules, the vast majority of coal that leaves the site is transported by rail. Extracted coal is moved from the mine and taken to be separated and washed at the sites Cwmbargoed Washery. Built in 1959 on land to the north and east of the railway connection to Fochriw Colliery, the coal washery was refurbished by Celtic Energy in 1992. In the summer of 2015 Miller Argent launched its, state of the art, coal washing facility on site - built at a cost of ¬£10 million, the facility was built to meet demand for high quality Welsh coal by the TATA steel works site in Port Talbot. The washed coal is taken from site by rail along the former route of the Rhymney Railway. Joining the modern Rhymney Line just south of Ystrad Mynach railway station, the trains then travel onwards via Cardiff and then West along the Vale of Glamorgan Line. In March 2017 Miller Argent sent its last delivery of coal to Aberthaw Power Station.

In 2003 they were indicted for child abuse for, among other things, keeping the children in cage-like enclosures. The Gravelles claimed the cages were made to protect the children from each other. Their trial motivated legislators in Ohio to pass laws to prevent people from adopting so many children without a great deal of oversight by the state. They used parenting methods similar to those used in attachment therapy, which involves very strict control of children using isolation, food deprivation, and other disciplinary measures that are widely considered to be unreasonably harsh, or even inhumane. The trial gained international attention and brought many inadequacies of the adoption services systems in Ohio to the fore. In 2005 the Gravelles were sentenced to two years in prison for their crimes.Judge: Caged Children Were Abused, AP story on foxnews.com, 12/22/05 According to newspaper reports, their therapist, Elaine Thompson, a social worker practicing as an attachment therapist, advised the Gravelles on parenting techniques. Thompson, according to these reports, had undertaken counselling or therapy, including holding therapy, with some of the Gravelle children. Elaine Thompson was indicted along with the Gravelles but pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in a plea bargain. The Gravelles served their two-year sentences from April 2009 to March 2011.

Directed by KRU member Yusry Abdul Halim, it is the first Malaysian film of this genre, and features almost 40% CGI footage. Comedian Saiful Apek stars the timid protagonist Hairi who obtains his gecko-like powers quite by accident and becomes a shock to his friend, who also tries his best to adjust to his superpowers while living in the fictional city of Metrofulus.The film received mixed review upon its release. A sequel, Cicakman 2: Planet Hitam, was released on 11 December 2008 in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei following the film's success in the Malaysian box-office. The original announced release is in the end of 2007.KRU Music Group A third film titled Cicak Man 3 was released on 12 March 2015 in Malaysia with an all new cast, where Zizan Razak took over Saiful's protagonist place instead. Plot Hairi Yatim (Saiful Apek), is a loser who lives in Metrofulus. While working in the lab, he accidentally drinks coffee that has been contaminated by a virus-infected gecko (Virus 266). He soon finds himself doing the most insane things, such as sticking to walls, making chirping cicak noises and adding bugs to his menu. He turns to his best friend and apartment mate, Danny (Yusry Abdul Halim), and begs him to find the reason behind his strange antics. Meanwhile, the people of Metrofulus are constantly being infected by new strains of viruses, and the only cure seems to come only from Professor Klon's (Aznil Nawawi) lab. Suspecting something amiss, Hairi and Danny launch their own investigation and discover that Professor Klon is not only the creator of such viruses, but also has a more sinister plan up his sleeve, backed by his business partners, the Ginger Boys (played by Adlin Aman Ramlie and AC Mizal), who first tend to take revenge on Professor Klon's failed experiment on them; making their senses turn abnormal. Hairi soon makes use of his new-found powers as \\"Cicakman\\" when he saves Tania (Fasha Sandha), Professor Klon's secretary from a threatening situation, and also ends up falling for her. However, he finds that his powers are more of a threat to his life, than a gift, and embarks on a mission to bring down Prof. Klon and the Ginger Boys before his time runs out.

Critical response While there were people who praised Cicak Man, there were many others who criticised this film greatly. Film critic Mansor Puteh in an interview by Harian Metro said \\"...the film has no 'soul'. There is no aesthetic values, culture or hidden meaning that allows the audience to think.\\" There were individuals who compared between Cicak Man and Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, and other superhero films from Hollywood, but before it was released to public, the director, Yusry had advised people to not compare Cicak Man with other superhero characters because the budget is \\"obviously lower\\" compared to Hollywood productions. Malaysianisms The film contains many in-jokes or references to Malaysian culture. Among them are: * Where clones \\"hang\\" (malfunction), the characters comment that the clones are just copies and not \\"ori\\" (original) This is a reference to Malaysian movie pirates, and the government's current crackdown on piracy and promotion of \\"ori\\" items instead. * When Hairi uses Tania's pass card to gain all-access to the entire Klon Technologies headquarters, he yells \\"Tahniah! Tahniah!\\" (Congrats! Congrats!) as a word play to cover up when the card reader system reads Tania's name. * When Hairi is trying to distinguish the 5 original ministers from their cloned counterparts, he gives a humorous question, \\"Original ke Spicy?\\" (\\"Original or Spicy?\\"), which refers to two of KFC's fried chicken flavour options in Malaysia.

The work is a compilation of descriptions published in the Entomological Magazine. In its preparation Walker used descriptions provided by the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday. The work is monographic in the sense that it includes amplified descriptions of the genera and species of previous authors and new species descriptions, thereby presenting a complete account of what was then known of the \\"Chalcidites\\". Works examined and cited are by : the German entomologist and zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, the Swedish physician and naturalist Johan Wilhelm Dalman, the Italian Entomologist Maximilian Spinola and the English entomologists John Obadiah Westwood and John Curtis. The descriptions required the collection,study and often the dissection of a large number of specimens. The parts were: *1833. Monographia chalcidum (continued from page 384). Ent. Mag. 1(5): 455-466. *1834. Monographia chalciditum (continued from p. 39). Ent. Mag. 2(2): 148-179. *1834. Monographia chalciditum (continued from p. 309). Ent. Mag. 2(4): 340-369. *1835.

Monographia Chalciditum. Volume 1. Balliere, London. 333 pp. *1839. Monographia Chalciditum. Volume 2. Balliere, London. 100 pp. Publication details Monographia Chalciditum was published by Hypolitus Balli√©re (1809-1867), 219, Regent Street, London, Jean-Baptiste Balli√®re, (1797-1885) 13, Rue d' √âcole de M√©decine, Paris and by J. and G. Weigel, Leipsig (Leipzig, Germany) in 1839. The Balli√®re family published mainly French medical works but through tradition, since many early doctors and pharmacists studied Botany, natural history works. Also in 1839 Balli√©re published Haliday's Hymenoptera Britannica : Alysia at London. It is doubtful that the financially adept Balli√©re brothers funded either- Monographium Chalciditum was the continuation of a series of papers in the Entomological Magazine, the style of which, may have led to its downfall. Content and subsequent works Volume 1 Subtitled, poetically \\"the green, myriads in the peopled grass\\" volume 1 of Monographia is a singularly dry work consisting of descriptions only. It covers new English, Irish and French species. Two more parts were published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History under the title Descriptions of British chalcidites. Following the Balli√©re volumes chalcids were described in only one more volume of Annals and Magazine of Natural History and that of 1846. Thereafter, the British Museum, Walkers employer, published, Walker's 100 page List of the specimens of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum. Printed by order of the Trustees, London. vi + 237 pp. Part I-Chalcidites ;100 pages. Volume 2 Part I In this Walker describes \\"species collected by C. Darwin Esq. These are from Australia :-Hobart's Town, Van Diemen's Land, King George Sound and Sydney, New South Wales; Part II Bahia, Brazil; Part III Chiloe; Part IV Charle's Island, Galapagos; Part V New Zealand; Part VI Jame's Island, Part VII St. Helena, high central land. Walker briefly corresponded with Darwin. The first letter, written in 1838, thanks Darwin for improving his descriptions of species by indicating localities and remarks that, with few exceptions the Chalcidites of South America and Australia are remarkably like European species. The second letter, written in December, 1843, tells Darwin that most of his chalcids were all similar to European species or genera, but other species were quite different from those known from Europe. The 15 Plates illustrating some of the species in volume 1 are by Haliday (A- P -there is no plate I) were published in The Entomologist Volume 1 between November 1840 and October 1842.

It is a facility used by some banks or other financial institutions to send messages (also called notifications or alerts) to customers' mobile phones using SMS messaging, or a service provided by them which enables customers to perform some financial transactions using SMS. Push and pull messages SMS banking services may use either push and pull messages. Push messages are those that a bank sends out to a customer's mobile phone, without the customer initiating a request for the information. Typically, a push message could be a mobile marketing message or an alert of an event which happens in the customer's bank account, such as a large withdrawal of funds from an ATM or a large payment involving the customer's credit card, etc. It may also be an alert that some payment is due, or that an e-statement is ready to be downloaded. Another type of push message is one-time password (OTPs). OTPs are the latest tool used by financial institutions to combat cyber fraud. Instead of relying on traditional memorized passwords, OTPs are sent to a customer's mobile phone via SMS, who are required to repeat the OTP to complete transactions using online or mobile banking. The OTP is valid for a relatively short period and expires once it has been used. Bank customers can select the type of activities for which they wish to receive an alert. The selection can be done either using internet banking or by phone. Pull messages are initiated by the customer, using a mobile phone, for obtaining information or performing a transaction in the bank account. Examples of pull messages include an account balance enquiry, or requests for current information like currency exchange rates and deposit interest rates, as published and updated by the bank. Typical push and pull services offered Depending on the selected extent of SMS banking transactions offered by the bank, a customer can be authorized to carry out either non-financial transactions, or both and financial and non- financial transactions. SMS banking solutions offer customers a range of functionality, classified by push and pull services as outlined below. Typical push services would include: * periodic account balance reporting (say at the end of month); * reporting of salary and other credits to the bank account; * successful or un-successful execution of a standing order; * successful payment of a cheque issued on the account; * insufficient funds; * large value withdrawals on an account; * large value withdrawals on the ATM or EFTPOS on a debit card; * large value payment on a credit card or out of country activity on a credit card. * one-time password and authentication * an alert that some payment is due * an alert that an e-statement is ready to be downloaded. Typical pull services would include: *Account balance enquiry; *Mini statement request; *Electronic bill payment; *Transfers between customer's own accounts, like moving money from a savings account to a current account to fund a cheque; *Stop payment instruction on a cheque; *Requesting for an ATM card or credit card to be suspended; *De-activating a credit or debit card when it is lost or the PIN is known to be compromised; *Foreign currency exchange rates enquiry; *Fixed deposit interest rates enquiry. Concerns and skepticism There is a very real possibility for fraud when SMS banking is involved, as SMS uses insecure encryption and is easily spoofable (see the SMS page for details). Supporters of SMS banking claim that while SMS banking is not as secure as other conventional banking channels, like the ATM and internet banking, the SMS banking channel is not intended to be used for very high-risk transactions. Quality of service Due to the concerns made explicit above, it is extremely important that SMS gateway providers can provide a decent quality of service for banks and financial institutions in regards to SMS services. Therefore, the provision of Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a requirement for this industry; it is necessary to give the bank customer delivery guarantees of all messages, as well as measurements on the speed of delivery, throughput, etc. SLAs give the service parameters in which a messaging solution is guaranteed to perform. The convenience factor The convenience of executing simple transactions and sending out information or alerting a customer on the mobile phone is often the overriding factor that dominates over the skeptics who tend to be overly bitten by security concerns. As a personalized end-user communication instrument, today mobile phones are perhaps the easiest channel on which customers can be reached on the spot, as they carry the mobile phone all the time no matter where they are. Besides, the operation of SMS banking functionality over phone key instructions makes its use very simple. This is quite different from internet banking which can offer broader functionality, but has the limitation of use only when the customer has access to a computer and the Internet. Also, urgent warning messages, such as SMS alerts, are received by the customer instantaneously; unlike other channels such as the post, email, Internet, telephone banking, etc. on which a bank's notifications to the customer involves the risk of delayed delivery and response. The SMS banking channel also acts as the bank's means of alerting its customers, especially in an emergency situation; e.g. when there is an ATM fraud happening in the region, the bank can push a mass alert (although not subscribed by all customers) or automatically alert on an individual basis when a predefined ‚Äòabnormal‚Äô transaction happens on a customer's account using the ATM or credit card. This capability mitigates the risk of fraud going unnoticed for a long time and increases customer confidence in the bank's information systems. Compensating controls for lack of encryption The lack of encryption on SMS messages is an area of concern that is often discussed. This concern sometimes arises within the group of the bank's technology personnel, due to their familiarity and past experience with encryption on the ATM and other payment channels. The lack of encryption is inherent to the SMS banking channel and several banks that use it have overcome their fears by introducing compensating controls and limiting the scope of the SMS banking application to where it offers an advantage over other channels. Suppliers of SMS banking software solutions have found reliable means by which the security concerns can be addressed. Typically the methods employed are by pre-registration and using security tokens where the transaction risk is perceived to be high. Sometimes ATM type PINs are also employed, but the usage of PINs in SMS banking makes the customer's task more cumbersome. Technologies SMS banking usually integrates with a bank's computer and communications systems. As most banks have multiple backend hosts, the more advanced SMS banking systems are built to be able to work in a multi-host banking environment; and to have open interfaces which allow for messaging between existing banking host systems using industry or de facto standards. Well developed and mature SMS banking software normally provide a robust control environment and a flexible and scalable operating environment. These solutions are able to connect seamlessly to multiple SMSC operators in the country of operation. Depending on the volume of messages that are required to be pushed, means to connect to the SMSC could be different, such as using simple modems or connecting over leased line using low level communication protocols (like SMPP, UCP etc.) Advanced SMS banking solutions also cater to providing failover mechanisms and least-cost routing options. Most online banking platforms are owned and developed by the banks using them. There is only one open source online banking platform supporting mobile banking and SMS payments called Cyclos, which is developed to stimulate and empower local banks in development countries.

He became one of the most popular animals in the history of the zoo because of his many successful escapes from his enclosures. He was nicknamed \\"the Hairy Houdini\\". Ken Allen was born in captivity at the San Diego Zoo in 1971. During the 1980s, Ken Allen gained worldwide attention for a series of three escapes from his enclosure, which had been thought to be escape-proof. During some of his escapes, his female companions would join him. Ken Allen's ability to outwit his keepers, as well as his docile demeanor during his escapes, resulted in fame. He had his own fan club, and was the subject of t-shirts and bumper stickers (most reading \\"Free Ken Allen\\"). A song, \\"The Ballad of Ken Allen\\", was written about him. Ken Allen developed b-cell lymphoma and was euthanized on December 1, 2000. He was 29 years old. Escapes During his 1985 escapes, first on June 13, again on July 29, and finally on August 13, Ken Allen would peacefully stroll around the zoo looking at other animals. Ken never acted violently or aggressively towards zoo patrons or animals. Zookeepers were initially stumped over how Ken Allen had managed to escape. Zoo staff began surveillance of his enclosure to try to catch him in the act, only to find that Ken Allen seemed to be aware that he was being watched. This forced zookeepers to go \\"undercover\\", posing as tourists to learn Ken Allen's escape route, but the ape was not fooled. Moreover, other orangutans began following Ken Allen's lead, escaping from their enclosure.Los Angeles Times, August 26, 1987, cited at pqarchiver Zoo officials eventually hired experienced rock climbers to find every finger, toe, and foothold within the enclosure, spending $40,000 to eliminate the identified holds.

Mary G. Burdette was his sister. Early life He was born in Greensboro, Pennsylvania, and received a secondary education in Peoria, Illinois. During the Civil War he served as a private in the 47th Illinois infantry. In 1869 he became night editor of the Peoria Daily Transcript and afterward was associated with other newspapers. He joined the staff of the Burlington Hawkeye in 1872, and his humorous paragraphs soon began to be quoted in newspapers throughout the country. With the encouragement of his first wife, the former Caroline S. Garret of Peoria, he began speaking in public. Consequently, he made a number of successful lecture tours. His lecture, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Mustache,\\" was delivered well over three thousand times during a 30-year period. He also wrote the poem \\"Orphan Born,\\" as well as \\"My First Cigar.\\" He was sometimes referred to as the Burlington Hawkeye Man.

It is one of the clubs that originally helped purchase the Amateur Championship trophy, and is one of the oldest golf clubs in the world, dating back to 1845. It is a private club that plays over the Barry Links, and is sometimes referred to as Barry or Panmure Barry. Due to its location next to Carnoustie it is often overlooked by visitors, and with the number of members limited to 500 it is one of the most underplayed courses in Scotland. The Course Although Panmure is a links course, it has some unusual features. The course is a mile or more from the sea, and many holes have beautiful trees which rarely come into play but create an unusual backdrop to the rolling links holes. The first and last three holes are fairly flat although still interesting, but the middle twelve holes are classic links holes. This is because the clubhouse had to be built near to a railway station, and the first and last three holes were needed to get to the land where the course was originally going to be built. It is also not a very long course at 6511 yards from the championship tees, but it proved to be the hardest final qualifying course for the 1999 Open Championship at Carnoustie. This is due to the well known barry rough that flanks every fairway, making accuracy from the tee essential. Ben Hogan Panmure is famous for being the place where Ben Hogan practised away from the attention of the media, prior to his only Open Championship appearance at Carnoustie in 1953. On the sixth hole he suggested that a bunker at the front right of the green would improve the hole, and one was subsequently created, known to this day as hogan's bunker. Hogan spent much of his time hitting shots to the 17th green, and one day he asked that the green be cut shorter to better simulate the conditions at Carnoustie. The head greenkeeper handed him a mower, and Hogan cut the grass himself, even cleaning the mower before returning it! Clubhouse Panmure also has one of the finest clubhouses in Scotland, modelled spiritually on the Royal Calcutta Golf Club. Panmure was again a final qualifying course for the 2007 Open Championship at Carnoustie, and despite being easily the shortest, it had the highest winning score of all three qualifiers having a 36 hole score of -5, as opposed to around -9 or -10 at the other 2 courses.

Self-castration Gang Bing is most notable for his act of self-castration as a display of loyalty to his emperor. He served under the Yongle Emperor, the third emperor of the Ming dynasty who ruled over China from 1402 to 1424. Historical accounts describe Gang Bing as the emperor's favorite general. Because of this, the Yongle Emperor placed Gang Bing in charge of the palace in Beijing while he left for a hunting expedition. At this point political intrigue within the walls of the Forbidden City forced Gang Bing to make a drastic choice. The Yongle Emperor possessed a large harem of concubines; sexual contact with a concubine by anyone other than the emperor was a severe offense. Fearing that rivals within the palace may accuse him of sexual improprieties with one of the 73 imperial concubines, Gang Bing decided to execute a plan of terrible self-infliction the night before the emperor left for his trip: he severed his own penis and testicles with a knife. The general then placed his severed organs into a bag under the saddle of the emperor‚Äôs horse. As predicted, when the Yongle Emperor returned from his hunt, one of the emperor's ministers reported that Gang Bing had had inappropriate relations within the imperial harem. When accused of misconduct, Gang Bing instructed that the emperor's saddle be retrieved and requested that the emperor reach inside the bag under the saddle. Inside the bag, the emperor found Gang Bing's shriveled, blackened genitalia. Deeply impressed, the Yongle Emperor elevated Gang Bing to the rank of chief eunuch, a politically powerful position within the palace; gave him numerous gifts; and proclaimed him holy. Memorial After Gang Bing's death around 1411, the Yongle Emperor had his general and chief eunuch deified as the Patron Saint of Eunuchs. In addition, the emperor assigned a plot of land on the outskirts of Beijing as a cemetery for eunuchs and built an ancestral hall in Gang Bing's honor. In 1530, the ancestral hall was expanded and renamed The Ancestral Hall of the Exalted Brave and Loyal (Huguo Baozhong Si), but the temple was popularly known as the \\"Eunuch‚Äôs Temple\\". In the early 20th century, the hall was still in use by eunuchs and the temple grounds contained courts and halls. In 1950, after the Communist takeover of China, the Eunuch's Temple was renamed Beijing Municipal Cemetery for Revolutionaries and in 1970 was again renamed Babaoshan National Cemetery for Revolutionaries, the name it bears today.

History The guild was formed in September 1906 at a meeting of sixteen ex-students of the Royal School of Art Needlework, under the name The Society of Certificated Embroideresses of the Royal School of Art Needlework. Miss Wade, head of the Royal School of Art Needlework was invited to be founder President, and Miss Scott who hosted the inaugural meeting and Beatrice Paulson Townsend, wife of W.G. Paulson Townsend, design master at the school, were invited to be vice-chairs. They separated during World War I but reunited after the war and began teaching embroidery to shell shocked and disabled servicemen as a form of occupational therapy. In 1920 Louisa Frances Persel (1870-1947) was appointed as the first President. By the time of World War II the Guild was well established and continued to promote the therapeutic value of embroidery. In the 1960s an offshoot of the Embroiderers' Guild was developed as a platform to exhibit professional embroidery to the public. Founded in 1962 and originally named 'The Professional Group of the Embroiderers' Guild' the group was pivitol in bringing textile art to the fore in the UK and beyond. Around twenty years later the group was later renamed The 62 Group of Textile Artists when the group decided to extend beyond embroidery and encompass other textile disciplinesBeaney, Maries & Walker in Millar, L. (ed.) (2011) Radical Thread. The 62 Group 1962-2012. Tunbridge Wells: Direct Design Books. From its centre in Aylesbury, and around the UK, the Guild works to celebrate and preserve embroidery's rich heritage, and to secure its living future as contemporary art and craft. The Guild has 175 adult Branches and Young Embroiderers Groups in the UK, organised in 10 Regions, with a sundry range of educational and social programmes. Many of the branches and regions contribute to local activities, celebrations and educational programmes for the public benefit. The Guild's activities and events for adults and children (from beginner onwards) providing opportunities to enjoy stitching and to discover the history and traditions of this ancient and international craft. Through outreach and distance learning programmes the Guild's education team brings the benefits of embroidery and its potential for creative and personal development to wide-ranging audiences. The Guild's centre at Bucks County Museum is a registered museum and holds a nationally significant, global collection of embroideries from early times to the present day. From the Summer of 2018 there will be a permanent exhibition of items from the Embroiderers' Guild Collection available for viewing at Bucks County Museum, Church Street, Aylesbury HP20 2QP. The initiative for 2017 was an exhibition of over 120 new pieces of work by Guild members and invited artists inspired by Page 17' of a book of their choice. Also launched in 2017 was an invitation to schools, colleges and academies to take part in creating the 'World's Longest Embroidery for Schools. Each participating school uses a one- metre length of fabric to tell their story. The Guild aims to involve 1000 schools from the UK and around the world. In 2018 Guild members are creating exhibitions each of 100 hearts to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War 1. For more information on these projects and other national, regional and local activities please visit the Guild's website. The Guild partners with high footfall exhibition venues to bring original and unique works to the attention of the public. In recent years the Guild and its members have created and exhibited works inspired by the 2012 London Olympics (over 2000 postcard sized images of participating nations); in partnership with the British Library and Ruskin College, Oxford led the design and creation of a piece designed by Cornelia Parker commemorating the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta; in partnership with the Landscape Institute/National Trust/English Heritage the Guild created over 40 exhibitions of work inspired by the life and times of Lancelot 'Capability' Brown (2015/2016) and in 2016 the Guild was commissioned by the London representatives of HBO Television to create a piece 3.3 metres high and 5.5 metres long depicting the WhiteWalker from 'A Game of Thrones' - 'The Hardhome Embroidery'. This piece was exhibited at 10 venues throughout the UK. It will be on display in Glasgow Caledonian University from July 2018 for a period extending into 2019.

The village is situated just north of Blagdon Lake, in North Somerset. The parish has a population of 218 and mainly consists of family-owned farmland. It no longer has any amenities apart from a telephone kiosk and a letter box. History The parish was part of the hundred of Hartcliffe. The village gave its name to the Butcombe Brewery. The microbrewery was set up in 1978 by Simon Whitmore. In 2003 the business was sold and moved to an industrial estate at Wrington, to be housed in a purpose-built brewery completed in March 2005. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare county constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Landmarks Butcombe Court is a late 18th-century grade II listed manor house which was built on the site of a medieval building. It is now in 3 separate ownerships. During World War II, Clifton College used Butcombe Court as a safe extension of the school, away from the bombs. The pre-preparatory school at Clifton College for younger children aged 3 to 8 is called Butcombe after the house.

Two days later the French abandoned the fort looking for refuge with the Tamoios, a native tribe from Brazil. The fort was destroyed and on March 17, 1560 the first Portuguese mass was celebrated on the island.

The locomotive is preserved at the Atlanta History Center. Antebellum The Texas was built in October 1856 for the Western & Atlantic Railroad by locomotive manufacturer Danforth, Cooke and Company in Paterson, New Jersey, and subsequently shipped from Paterson to the Port of Savannah, thence delivered via the Georgia Rail Road & Banking Company and Macon & Western Railroad to the W&A; headquarters in Atlanta. The Texas provided freight and passenger service on the W&A;'s main line between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Civil War and the Great Locomotive Chase At the onset of the Civil War, the locomotive primarily hauled local freight and cargo without any major incident. However, on April 12, 1862, the Texas, while pulling a load of 12 cars from Dalton southbound towards Atlanta, was commandeered by William Allen Fuller to chase down spies, led by James J. Andrews, during the \\"Great Locomotive Chase.\\" Steaming in reverse after jettisoning the railcars, the Texas pursued the fleeing General over 50 miles before the raiders abandoned their stolen engine two miles north of Ringgold, Georgia. The Texass engineer, Peter Bracken, towed the abandoned General back to Adairsville, Georgia, and then picked up his 12 cars and steamed into Atlanta, well behind schedule, but with good reason. Following the incident, the Texas and nine boxcars were loaned to the East Tennessee & Virginia Railroad to haul salt and cargo from the mines at Saltville, Virginia in 1863. While in Virginia, the engine was captured by the U.S. Military Railroad (USMRR). Eventually, as Union forces made their way toward Atlanta, the W&ARR; and its 46 other locomotives were captured as well. Postbellum The USMRR returned the Texas, W&ARR;, and its other locomotives to the State of Georgia on September 25, 1865. The engine continued to serve the W&ARR; during the Reconstruction era, though under several different stewards as the public railroad was steadily privatized. The State of Georgia numbered the W&ARR;'s engines in 1866, leading to the Texas's designation as number 49. In 1870, the W&ARR; was leased out, for a period of twenty years, to a group of Georgia investors led by former war-time governor Joseph E. Brown. Alongside the W&ARR;'s other 44 locomotives at the time, the Texas was renumbered and renamed - becoming the Cincinnati, number 12. During the lease period, the engine received a new boiler (1877), was converted to burn coal, and was regauged (1886) as the W&ARR; converted its entire locomotive rolling stock to the national standard gauge. The W&ARR; lease was renewed in 1890, though with a different lessee: the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway. The Texas remained the Cincinnati under the NC&StL; and was renumbered 212. In 1895, the engine was withdrawn from mainline service and stored on a siding in Vinings, Georgia.The Texas at Vinings Station, 1895, VIS 197, Wilbur G. Kurtz, Sr. Visual Collection, Kenan Research Center, Atlanta History Center, Atlanta, Georgia. By 1903, the engine had briefly returned to service on a branch line serving a corn mill in Emerson, Georgia. It served there until its retirement in 1907, at which time it was sent to the W&ARR;'s yard in Atlanta, where it would await its disposition. In August 1907, an article in the Atlanta Constitution brought to attention the deteriorated state of the locomotive and its historical significance. A fundraising effort began for its preservation.\\"Famous Texas on the Block this Morning,\\" The Atlanta Constitution (Atlanta, Georgia), August 2, 1907 In response, NC&StL; president John W. Thomas stated that he was willing to turn the engine to either the State of Georgia or the City of Atlanta, should either be willing to accept it. Accordingly, the Georgia General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing the need to preserve the engine. However, neither the railway nor the state took any physical action to move and/or protect the engine, which thus remained derelict on a siding. A grassroots campaign led by the Atlanta Georgian newspaper and an ad-hoc group (composed of the Atlanta chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the Inman Park Students' Club, and the Atlanta Woman's Club) succeeded in securing the locomotive for the City of Atlanta instead. On February 17, 1908, the Texas was officially donated to the \\"Ladies of Atlanta\\" by the NC&StL.; The group, in turn, transferred the engine to the city. However, despite the Texas's donation, the locomotive remained in the W&A; yard. In 1910, Atlanta artist and historian, Wilbur G. Kurtz, began writing articles in the Atlanta Constitution advocating preservation of the Texas. The following year, the engine was moved to Grant Park, though it remained exposed to the elements and funds for its restoration were still lacking. In 1927, the Texas was placed in the basement of the newly constructed Cyclorama, but remained unrestored or altered from its retirement appearance in 1907. As stated, during its service life, the Texas underwent numerous rebuilds and modifications. Most notably, the engine's smokestack was replaced with a diamond design suited for coal-burning, and its cowcatcher had been replaced with a wooden step for use in yard service. The locomotive's current tender originally belonged to the United States Military Railroad's Dalton locomotive, built in 1864 by the Mason Machine Works of Taunton, Massachusetts.Atlanta History Center exhibit label The Dalton was sold to the Western & Atlantic after the war, renamed William MacRae, and operated on the W&A; until retired in 1890, with its tender salvaged for the Texas when the latter was briefly returned to service in 1900. In 1936, the locomotive, under the guidance of Kurtz, was cosmetically restored to resemble what he believed to be its wartime appearance. The engine's smokestack was replaced with one resembling the balloon design of the Civil War era, its horizontal strap-iron slat cowcatcher was restored, as were the nameplates on the sides of the boiler. The basement in which the engine was placed, while adequate to protect the engine, had been criticized for its small size which made viewing the engine difficult. As with the General, several proposals had been made as to where the Texas should be displayed, including placing it on display in the Atlanta Union Station, at the site of present-day Underground Atlanta, at Stone Mountain Park, among others - none of which materialized. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, there was growing concern about the condition of the panoramic painting of the Battle of Atlanta (the Atlanta Cyclorama), which had suffered from storm damage as well as long periods of neglect. In 1972, the City of Atlanta developed plans to renovate the Cyclorama building, including a complete restoration of the painting as well as an enlarged display area for the Texas. However, the renovation did not begin until 1979, and was completed in 1982. Texas displayed in the Cyclorama. Contemporary After the 2008 restoration of the Gettysburg Cyclorama, focus shifted once more to the Atlanta Cyclorama and its deteriorated condition, prompting the City of Atlanta to explore another restoration and potential relocation of the painting. Ultimately, a decision was made to relocate and restore the painting, with a transfer ultimately including the Texas locomotive and other artifacts at the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum as well. Around this time, the cities of Marietta, Kennesaw, as well as the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, Georgia expressed interest in acquiring the locomotive. However, city officials in Atlanta determined the engine should remain preserved in tandem with the painting. In July 2014, the city of Atlanta announced that the Cyclorama collection, including the painting, locomotive, and other artifacts were to be relocated to the Atlanta History Center in Buckhead. The Texas was removed from the Cyclorama building in December 2015, marking the first time the Texas has been removed from the building since its 1981 remodeling. The engine received a cosmetic restoration performed at the North Carolina Transportation Museum by a private contractor, Steam Operations Corporation, who had previously restored the Norfolk and Western Railway no. 611 to operation at that facility, before being placed in the expanded history center. The engine has been restored to its 1880s appearance, as opposed to the wartime appearance it had from the 1936 restoration. As such, it has received a new diamond stack similar to the one it had when retired, as well as a new cowcatcher with vertical wooden slats (similar to that currently worn by the General), a black paint scheme, and was returned to its 1870s number, 12, though retains the Texas name, with a newly fabricated number plate to reflect the number. The old balloon stack, cowcatcher, and other removed elements from the 1936 restoration will remain in the history center's collection, and may be exhibited separately.http://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/assets/documents/Texas-return- release.pdf The engine's new look caused a controversy in some circles, with critics saying the Texass new look erased its Civil War history. Commenting on the engine's new appearance, Gordon Jones, of the Atlanta History Center, noted that the Texas was in service for fifty years, the Great Locomotive Chase occupying but a few hours of its service life, and said \\"We've already got one locomotive [the General] telling the story of the Great Locomotive Chase. We can utilize the Texas to tell a different story.\\" The fully restored Texas was publicly unveiled by the North Carolina Transportation Museum on April 28, 2017, during a weekend long celebration in which it was exhibited alongside other engines at the museum, including the visiting Lehigh Valley No. 126 and the above mentioned Norfolk and Western no. 611. The Texas was scheduled to begin its two-day move to the Atlanta History Center on May 3, 2017, but a logistical issue delayed the beginning of the move from North Carolina until May 4. It arrived on May 5. The Atlanta History Center's new Atlanta railroads exhibit, featuring the locomotive, opened on November 17, 2018. The Cyclorama painting and related exhibits opened to the public in spring 2019. Confirmation of legal ownership On April 12, 2015, the 153rd anniversary of the Great Locomotive Chase, the Marietta Daily Journal published an article advocating the transfer of the Texas to the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw, Georgia. Several state legislators indicated their support, arguing the locomotive was state property due to its association with the once-public W&ARR.; Following the piece, the Georgia State Properties Commission requested a legal opinion from the State's Office of the Attorney General concerning the engine's ownership. The State Attorney General's office concluded that the Texas was property of the City of Atlanta given the evidence discovered, particularly citing the NC&StL;'s right to disposition of property as clarified in their 1890 and 1919 leases with the State of Georgia for the W&ARR.; As a result, the donation of the Texas to the City of Atlanta on February 17, 1908 was a legally permissible transfer, meaning the City of Atlanta continues to hold ownership rights to the locomotive today.

Above the main door is a relief of Saint George standing over the slain dragon. The yellow-brick interior has broad aisles and a wide nave of five bays of Early English style arches and a debased Romanesque clerestory of two windows above each arch. On the south aisle are a series of red marble tablets set in a carved Portland stone frieze commemorating members of the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) who died on active service 1882 - 1920.Army Service Corps in the Cathedral of St Michael and St George, Aldershot - Imperial War Museums website The cathedral has many fine stained glass windows of saints and Biblical scenes by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. One window in the south wall of the Royal Army Service Corps Memorial Chapel is dedicated to the memory of Julia Horatia Ewing, the wife of Colonel Alexander Ewing who wrote the hymn Jerusalem the Golden. Mrs Ewing was an author who chronicled and illustrated the everyday life of the ordinary soldier in Aldershot. The reason some of the stained glass windows do not fill their niches is because these were moved to the cathedral following the closure of the Church of St Michael and St Sebastian in 1973. The ornate east end, with a rich 1930s mosaic on the reredos portraying the Last Supper, contrasts with the simplicity of the rest of the chancel, which was reordered to provide room for a free-standing plain altar. The East Window over the altar is dedicated to the men of the Royal Army Service Corps who lost their lives during the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. Tablets in the Sanctuary commemorate the 376 men who died. The window depicts The Ascension, The Translation of Elijah, The Crucifixion, Moses and the brazen serpent and Samson carrying off the Gates of Gaza. The memorial to those who fell in World War I consists of the mural decorations in the Sanctuary and Chancel. The Blessed Sacrament Chapel on the south side of the nave was constructed in 1998. The brass panels in the lower part of the screen were originally in the altar rail of the Church of St Michael and St Sebastian. The Lady Chapel has a particularly fine mosaic dedicated to the Army Chaplains who lost their lives in the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. The chancel furnishings are sparse and modern.

However, despite a comprehensive refurbishment this organ is no longer used mainly because of asbestos being found in the organ pipe gallery. The Allen organ currently used in the cathedral originally belonged to the noted organist Carlo Curley and was obtained in 2014 after his death.

The parish, which has a population of 2,582, is within the unitary authority of North Somerset and located on the western edge of the Mendip Hills, close to Weston-super- Mare. The hamlets of Elborough, Lower Canada and Upper Canada lie within the parish. History Elborough Hill is an Iron Age hill fort in the south east of the parish, with associated Iron Age or Romano-British field systems. Hutton was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Hotune, meaning 'The enclosure on the projection of land' from the Old English hoh and tun. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. Hutton Court was built in the 15th century as a manor house and has been classified as a Grade II* listed building. Hutton has been twinned with the Kenyan village of Dabaso since 1999. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District. The village falls in 'Hutton and Locking' electoral ward. The ward starts in the north at Locking visits Hutton and continues south to Bleadon. The total population taken from the 2011 census was 6,417. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Weston-super-Mare county constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the 15th century and is a Grade II* listed building.

Joe's Pub is located at 425 Lafayette Street near Astor Place in Manhattan, New York City. It is named after Joseph Papp, the theatrical producer who established the New York Shakespeare Festival, The Public Theater and the free Shakespeare in the Park program in Central Park. The venue is notable for being where Amy Winehouse and Adele made their U.S. headlining concert debuts. In 2013, in its 15th anniversary year, the Pub was declared one of Rolling Stone Magazine's 10 Best Clubs in America. History Joe's Pub opened on October 16, 1998 with an inaugural concert performed by Carl Hancock Rux. Soon after, a reviewer for The New York Times wrote \\"You enter through the side door of the Joseph Papp Public Theater. Farther south on Lafayette Street, revolving doors admit patrons to the Public's various theatrical spaces, but here, on the outskirts, an iron-fenced portal offers entree to the theater's new nightclub.\\" He continued, \\"But Joe's Pub is a much less lofty enterprise, carved as it is from ground-floor back-office space at the theater.\\" The $2.35 million club is the result, in part, of a construction and renovation grant to the Public from city capital funds that includes refurbishment of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. There were some doubters when the club opened in October who wondered whether the Public Theater could make a theater-night life alliance work. Six months later, according to George C. Wolfe, the then-producer of the Public, Joe's Pub \\"is actually doing better than I thought it would.\\" He continued to say, \\"The club's programming is idiosyncratic: from ethnic music ensembles to spoken-word artists to the most promising young musical-theater composers and performers on the contemporary scene, the changing roster has generated an after-hours theatricality all its own.\\" The Pub is known as one of New York City's live showcase venues, catering to an eclectic mix of music genres. This defining feature of Joe's Pub - its extraordinary variety - was the vision of Public Theater Associate Producer Bonnie Metzgar and principal booking agent Bill Bragin, an aficionado of music in all forms and a world- music DJ in his own right. Bragin established relationships with artists that have made Joe's Pub a home-base for local, domestic, and international acts. In 2007, when Bragin left Joe's Pub to work for Lincoln Center, Shanta Thake was unanimously given the head-booker position by the board of the Public Theater. Thake currently serves as the director of Joe's Pub, with Alex Knowlton acting as associate director. In 2011, the Pub, along with the rest of The Public's downtown building, received a top-to-bottom renovation, leading to improved sight lines, expanded seating capacity and a new food and beverage partnership with Chef Andrew Carmellini. Venue The venue is equipped with theater-quality lighting and sound. During its formative years, the sound was engineered by Kurt Wolf, former punk-rock guitarist for Pussy Galore. The club established a reputation as having extraordinary sound during this time. When Wolf moved on to other projects, Jon Shriver, a technician who has worked with John Legend and The Notorious B.I.G., began doing the audio engineering. The sound quality at Joe's Pub remains at the top of the \\"best in NYC\\" short list among critical reviewers. Joe's Pub also serves as a bar and restaurant during performance hours and is known as being a top romantic spot in New York City after opening. When The Public reopened in 2012 after the renovation, the Pub's food and beverage partner Joe's Pub LLC - Kevin Abbott, Serge Becker, Josh Pickard and Paul Salmon - was joined by the Noho Hospitality Group, the restaurant group led by Andrew Carmellini and Luke Ostrom. The group also launched a full-service restaurant, The Library at The Public. The decor of Joe's Pub is the work of interior designer and Joe's Pub LLC partner Serge Becker, the man behind many New York City hotspots, including La Esquina on Delancey Street. Patrons often note an accordion encased along the east wall of the Pub: Becker intended the design of the interior to be modeled after the accordion, from the striped, bee-pollen bar, to the strip lighting, to the exposed sound-proofing. Along the south wall, photographs of Joe Papp and famous colleagues are on display. At one point, the photos featured a young Kevin Spacey, mustachioed in fur coat. With the 2011 renovation, the photos were updated to include artists like Leonard Cohen, Adele, Allen Toussaint, Alan Cumming, Amy Winehouse and, of course, Joseph Papp. Notable performers * Adele * Ad-Rock (as The Tender Moments) * Amadou & Mariam * Andi Almqvist * Laurie Anderson * Antony and the Johnsons * Sara Bareilles * Richard Barone * Sandra Bernhard * Cristin Milioti * Diane Birch * Birdy * Jeremiah Birnbaum * Karen Black * Heidi Blickenstaff * Justin Vivian Bond * Bono * Maxine Brown * Oscar Brown, Jr * Claremont Trio * David Byrne * Don Byron * Calexico * Vanessa Carlton * Neko Case * Alice Coltrane * Shawn Colvin * Elvis Costello * Gavin Creel * Darren Criss * Alan Cumming * Vincent D'Onofrio * Dion * Thomas Dolby * Celso Duarte * East Village Opera Company * Gad Elmaleh * Mike Errico * Bridget Everett * Feist * Harvey Fierstein * Floanne * Sutton Foster * Fountains of Wayne * Al Franken * Alison Fraser * John Gallagher, Jr. * Ana Gasteyer * Jonathan Groff * Bebel Gilberto * Goapele * Lesley Gore * Macy Gray * David Gray * Randy Harrison * Emmylou Harris * Anne Hathaway * Darren Hayes * Nona Hendryx * Jackie Hoffman * Toninho Horta * The Hot Sardines * Joe Iconis * Katherine Jenkins * Norah Jones * Jovanotti * Alicia Keys * Ang√©lique Kidjo * Eartha Kitt * Kronos Quartet * Bettye LaVette * Catie Lazarus * Ute Lemper * Caissie Levy * Huey Lewis * John Lithgow * Paul Loren * Taylor Mac * Dave Malloy * Aimee Mann * Charlotte Martin * Dina Martina * John Mayer * Del McCoury * Audra McDonald * Nellie McKay * Donna McKechnie * Idina Menzel * Lea Michele * John Cameron Mitchell * Isaac Mizrahi * Mos Def * Mark Murphy * Youssou N'Dour * Rory O'Malley * Amanda Palmer * Dolly Parton * Adam Pascal * Liz Phair * Lauren Pritchard * Puddles Pity Party * Wallace Roney * Carl Hancock Rux (inaugural performer) * Mort Sahl (introduced by Woody Allen) * Neil Sedaka * Anoushka Shankar * Sxip Shirey * Sarah Silverman * Joss Stone * Marty Stuart * John Tartaglia * Vienna Teng * They Might Be Giants * Richard Thompson * Jane Siberry * Cyndi Lauper * Nancy Sinatra * Joseph Keckler * Russell Crowe * Syd Straw * Hugh Jackman * Jeremy Jordanhttp://www.playbill.com/article/what-is- your-damage-heathers-the-musical-gets-joes-pub-concerts-sept-13-com-171668 * Catie Curtis * Brett Dennen * Mary Gauthier * Minnie Driver * Joe Jackson * Novice Theory * Betty * Tammy Faye Starlite * Timber Timbre * Allen Toussaint * Pete Townshend * Aaron Tveit * Natalie Weiss * Hayley Westenra * Lillias White * Amy Winehouse *Joey Arias *Nick Adams References External links Joe's Pub Photo Archive (Kevin Yatarola, House Photographer): Kevin Yatarola photography Category:Nightclubs in Manhattan Category:Music venues in Manhattan Category:Drinking establishments in Manhattan Category:Music venues completed in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in New York (state) Category:East Village, Manhattan ","title":"Joe's Pub"},{"id":"8145327","text":"The Parisian Market (aka Le March√© des parisien or Les March√© des Innocents) is a comic ballet in one act, with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Cesare Pugni.Petipa Society website First presented by the Imperial Ballet under the title Le March√© des parisien on at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The B-Line is a railroad line owned and operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The most heavily-used section of the line runs from Front Royal east to Manassasthe NS B-Line along a former Southern Railway line. The B-Line extends west into Strasburg, although only one local train per day frequents that section of it. Its east end is at the Washington District, and it crosses the Hagerstown District at Front Royal. Since the 1999 breakup of Conrail, when Norfolk Southern acquired the Lurgan Branch from the north end of the Hagerstown District into Pennsylvania, the B-Line east of Front Royal has been a major connection, allowing traffic on the Washington District to bypass Washington, D.C.. The B-Line supports mainly intermodal and manifest trains, although beginning in late 2018, Norfolk Southern began running coal unit trains on it more frequently than before.

Following the review, in January 2008 the government initiated a public consultation period on proposals to legalise personal copying.  Copyright terms extension  On November 27, 2006, it was reported that Gowers would not recommend for the copyright term of recorded music to be extended from the current 50 years after the date of recording. The British Phonographic Industry and prominent musicians, such as Cliff Richard and Ian Anderson, had lobbied for an extension to 95 years, matching the length of copyright provided in the United States; other musicians, such as Dave Rowntree of Blur provided counteropinions. The Gowers Review found that the UK, compared with the USA, suffers no apparent impediment to creativity due to this disparity. To coincide with the publication of the review on the 6 December a full-page advertisement entitled Fair play for musicians, was taken in the Financial Times of December 7, stating \\"We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright on sound recordings\\", and was signed by over 4,500 musicians, including a few dead ones.Lessig Blog: Ok, so I'm wrong Repercussions Richard Sargeant, a civil servant who wrote large amounts of the Review,The Register: EU votes for longer music copyright was later hired by Google.

It is close to the M5 motorway in the unitary authority of North Somerset. The parish includes the village of Christon and has a population of 192. History Loxton takes its name from the Lox Yeo River (once simply known as the Lox), on which it is situated. The village is mentioned in the Domesday book as Lochestone. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred. The village has been populated since Norman times. Old mine-workings on the hills indicate that at one time mining was abundant, probably for calamine, lead, copper and more recently yellow ochre. During the construction of the M5 motorway a Roman or pre-Roman settlement was uncovered at Christon. Christon Court has medieval origins, but the current building dates from the 17th century. \\"The Loxton Murder\\" In 1954 the village came to national attention when Miss Noreen O'Connor, a nurse, killed Friederika Alwine Maria Buls by \\"plucking out\\" her eyes. She was tried for murder and found guilty but insane.The Loxton Murder - page 1 Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. I is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Axbridge Rural District.

The salicide process involves the reaction of a metal thin film with silicon in the active regions of the device, ultimately forming a metal silicide contact through a series of annealing and/or etch processes. The term \\"salicide\\" is a compaction of the phrase self- aligned silicide. The description \\"self-aligned\\" suggests that the contact formation does not require photolithography patterning processes, as opposed to a non-aligned technology such as polycide. The term salicide is also used to refer to the metal silicide formed by the contact formation process, such as \\"titanium salicide\\", although this usage is inconsistent with accepted naming conventions in chemistry. Contact Formation Salicide process The salicide process begins with deposition of a thin transition metal layer over fully formed and patterned semiconductor devices (e.g. transistors). The wafer is heated, allowing the transition metal to react with exposed silicon in the active regions of the semiconductor device (e.g., source, drain, gate) forming a low-resistance transition metal silicide. The transition metal does not react with the silicon dioxide nor the silicon nitride insulators present on the wafer. Following the reaction, any remaining transition metal is removed by chemical etching, leaving silicide contacts in only the active regions of the device. A fully integrable manufacturing process may be more complex, involving additional anneals, surface treatments, or etch processes. Chemistry Typical transition metals used or considered for use in salicide technology include titanium, cobalt, nickel, platinum, and tungsten. One key challenge in developing a salicide process is controlling the specific phase (compound) formed by the metal-silicon reaction. Cobalt, for example, may react with silicon to form Co2Si, CoSi, CoSi2, and other compounds. However, only CoSi2 has a sufficiently low resistance to form an effective electrical contact. For some compounds, the desired high-resistance phase is not thermodynamically stable, such as C49-TiSi2, which is metastable with respect to the low-resistance C54 phase. Other considerations Another challenge facing successful process integration include lateral growth, especially underneath the gate, which will short circuit the device.

He was a goal-kicking for the Australian national team and a stalwart for the Parramatta Eels club. He played in 22 Tests and 11 World Cup matches between 1973 and 1982. Cronin retired as the NSWRL Premiership's and the Australian Kangaroos' all-time highest point-scorer and has since been named amongst the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century.Century's Top 100 Players Country and early representative career Cronin played for Christian Brothers (now Edmund Rice) in the Illawarra competition as an under 12. He was so good that when his team made the semi-finals the opposition appealed against Cronin's inclusion on residence grounds, claiming he was from Gerringong. Cronin's first grade career began in 1969 for Gerringong. He was selected to play for Country in 1973 where he impressed enough to make that year's Kangaroo tour. He played in two Tests and ten minor tour matches and finished as the tour's highest point scorer with seven tries and twenty eight goals. In 1974 he was named New South Wales' Country Rugby League Player of the Year.Country Rugby League Player of the Year at crlnsw.com.au He played in all three Tests of the 1974 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain and the following year he played in NSW Country's historic 1975 win over Sydney City. He was selected in Australia's 1975 World Cup squad and played in five matches in the tournament in the centres alongside Bob Fulton. In a match against Wales in Sydney during the series, he kicked nine goals. By this time Cronin was one of the most eminent rugby league centres in the world, yet he continually rejected big money offers to go to Sydney and played for his home town of Gerringong on the NSW South Coast. Parramatta career In 1977 Cronin joined the Parramatta Eels but for many years continued to commute to training and matches from Gerringong where he owned and was publican of the local hotel. He played at centre for New South Wales in the inaugural 1980 State of Origin game. Cronin was a member of Parramatta's star studded backlines of the early 1980s playing alongside Brett Kenny, Steve Ella, Peter Sterling and Eric Grothe. In combination with all of these greats he played in four winning Grand Finals for Parramatta (1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986). Alongside teammate Ray Price, Cronin enjoyed a fairy tale last match end to his career in the 1986 Grand Final where he kicked both goals in the Eels' 4‚Äì2 victory over Canterbury-Bankstown. Cronin played 216 games in ten years with Parramatta placing him equal fourth with Bob O'Reilly on the list of most first grade appearances. His club point scoring tally of 1,971 points (75 tries, 865 goals and 2 field goals) is the standing Parramatta record and is over 150 points clear of the next contender Luke Burt. He kicked 11 goals in a round 14 match of 1982 against the Illawarra Steelers, and 10 goals in the round 22 clash of 1978 against the Newtown Jets. He twice scored 27 points in a match for Parramatta. In 1985 he overtook Graham Eadie's record for the most points scored in an NSWRFL career (1,917); Cronin's eventual total of 1,971 stood as the new career record for sixteen seasons until it was bettered by Daryl Halligan in 2000. Later representative career The 1978 Kangaroo tour was Cronin's second, and he played in all five Tests plus 12 minor matches again returning home as the tour's highest point scorer with 142 points. He played in all Tests of the 1979 domestic Ashes series against Great Britain kicking 24 goals in the course of the three games. He played in seven Tests over three series against New Zealand in 1978, 1980 and 1982 before he retired from international representative football. In 22 Tests for Australia between 1973 and 1982 he scored 5 tries and 93 goals for 201 points. Aside from Cronin's first 5 Tests in 1973 and 1974 when Graeme Langlands was captain and goal kicker, Mick Cronin was Australia's first choice kicker in his next seventeen Test appearances. State of origin folklore Cronin made 21 appearances for New South Wales Blues up till 1981 under the old place of residence rules. He played in the inaugural State of Origin match in 1980 and made five further appearances for the Blues under the origin criteria up till the game III in 1983, despite having retired from international representative availability in 1982. Mick Cronin's name was etched into Origin folklore that first night in July 1980 when fifteen minutes from the end of the game his Parramatta club teammate Arthur Beetson pirouetted in from the right side while Cronin was held up in a tackle by Queensland half Greg Oliphant and threw a loose left-arm around Cronin's chin. To this day that incident is cited in evidence that from the outset State of Origin football was \\"the real deal\\" where deeply rooted State passion would take priority over club friendships and loyalties. State of Origin rugby league has ever since been promoted as \\"state against state, mate against mate\\". This archrivalry was typified by the Cronin/Beetson altercation notwithstanding that it was quickly forgotten and that they sat next to each other on the return plane trip to Sydney and didn't mention the incident.Big League 2005 State of Origin Collectors Edition p16 Altogether Cronin represented New South Wales 27 times from 1973 to 1983, scoring 7 tries, 87 goals for 195 points. Point scoring feats When he retired in 1986 he was the greatest point-scorer in the history of the NSWRL premiership with 1,971 points and other point-scoring honours include: ‚Ä¢ Country record of 316 pts in 20 Group 7 matches in 1971 ‚Ä¢ Most points in a club season (282 in 1978) ‚Äì the standing Parramatta club record. ‚Ä¢ Most points in a calendar year (547 from 52 games in 1978) ‚Ä¢ Most points by a player from any country in World Cup clashes (108) ‚Ä¢ Most points in the world in Tests (199) ‚Ä¢ Most points in a Test series (54 against Great Britain 1979) ‚Ä¢ Most successive successful kicks for goal in top-grade rugby league (26 in 1978). ‚Ä¢ Leading point-scorer in 1977, 1978, 1979, 1982 & 1985 Coaching In 1990 he took on the coaching responsibility at Parramatta in a period when their playing roster was at its weakest for years. In 1992 he coached a Country origin side to victory over City origin. He coached the Eels until the end of the 1993 NSWRL season. In 2016 he coached the Gerringong Lions in the Group 7 Rugby League competition.http://www.theage.com.au/rugby-league/league- news/south-coast-club-gerringong-faces-punishment-after-shunning-women-rugby- league-players-20160821-gqxn3l.html Accolades Cronin was named \\"Country Player of the Year\\" in 1974. He won unprecedented consecutive Rothmans Medals in 1977‚Äì78. In 1985 he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia \\"in recognition of service to the sport of Rugby League Football\\". Cronin received the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 and was honoured further in 2001 by being awarded the Centenary Medal \\"for service to Australian society through the sport of Rugby League\\". At the 2007 Dally M Awards Cronin was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame In February 2008, Cronin was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

It is subtitled Being Illustrations and Descriptions of the Genera of Insects found in Great Britain and Ireland: Containing Coloured Figures from Nature of the Most Rare and Beautiful Species, and in Many Instances of the Plants Upon Which they are Found. Proof impression: Plate 674, lobster moth, Stauropus fagi Proof impression: Plate 722, wood leopard moth, Zeuzera aescult The work comprises 770 hand-coloured, copper-plate engravings, each 8 by inches (20√ó14 cm), together with two or more pages of text. The work was issued in monthly parts over 16 years, each part comprising three or more (usually four) plates. Plates were initially printed on James Whatman's Turkey Mill paper and then (circa 1832) on Rye Mill paper. It was a masterpiece of the engraver's and colourist's art, described by the eminent French naturalist Georges Cuvier as the \\"paragon of perfection\\". Close examination of a proof set of plates (see below) reveals an obsessive attention to detail. The shading of the foliage is typically achieved by multiple, finely engraved lines spaced at intervals of five or more to the millimetre. The fronds (olfactory receptors) of many moth antennae are individually coloured ‚Äì as in plate 674 (left). Several beetles and flies have body and limb highlights picked out in minute dots and lines of powdered gold. Thoracic and abdominal hairs are mostly painted individually. Where transparent wings are shown extended the colouring involved the precise application of multiple colour washes overlaid by a satin finish, gum arabic glaze to reproduce the visual effect of iridescence. Almost every plate includes an equally well rendered botanical element, often the dominant part of the illustration. In a footnote to the first plate, Curtis explains this as follows: Every illustration and line drawing was engraved or finished by Curtis himself, all the plates in volumes I, II, XV and XVI were engraved entirely by his hand. He also personally coloured the four proof sets and very closely supervised the hand colouring of all other plates. The final issue of the first edition (December 1839) included comprehensive indexes to all volumes plus a newly written eight-page preface summarising the production, costs and efforts involved. Also published at that time was a complete list of subscribers for each volume and detailed instructions for binding the work into eight volumes to generate the correct sequence of orders. Many copies were, however, bound in the alternative manner as sixteen volumes with the plates in numerical order. Curtis's original 778 drawings (some drawings were combined to produce a single plate, e.g. plate 703) were purchased by Lord Rothschild whose heirs, after having unsuccessfully tried to sell them in 1910, donated them to the Natural History Museum, London. The work was unsystematically produced but each plate is dated, so this generally introduces no problems of name priority. However, confusion can arise with reprinted plates 1 to 34 (see below) where the text was rewritten, often with changes to nomenclature, yet the dates shown on the plates remained unchanged. Aside from its noted illustrations, British Entomology is a work of taxonomy introducing many new species. This is especially true of the folios on Diptera and Hymenoptera. In his preface to the work, published in December 1839, Curtis writes: \\"... the articles and descriptions are my own writing; for any errors therefore I alone am accountable\\". However, it is clear from the dedications to the individual volumes that he had help from the likes of Alexander Henry Haliday, James Charles Dale, William Kirby and others. If systematically bound as intended and instructed by Curtis, the resulting eight-volume set will be as follows: *Volume 1 ‚Äì Coleoptera (Part 1) dedicated to William Kirby and Alexander Macleay *Volume 2 ‚Äì Coleoptera (Part2) dedicated to William Jackson Hooker and John Stevens Henslow *Volume 3 ‚Äì Dermaptera, Dictyoptera, Orthoptera, Strepsiptera, Hymenoptera (Part 1) dedicated to John Lindley and Charles Lyell *Volume 4 ‚Äì Hymenoptera (Part 2) dedicated to Pierre Andr√© Latreille and William Sharp Macleay *Volume 5 ‚Äì Lepidoptera (Part 1) dedicated to James Charles Dale and Charles Daubeny *Volume 6 ‚Äì Lepidoptera (Part 2) dedicated to Charles A. Harris and William Spence *Volume 7 ‚Äì Homoptera, Hemiptera, Aphaniptera dedicated to Alexander Henry Haliday, Henry Walker and Francis Walker *Volume 8 ‚Äì Diptera, Omaloptera, dedicated to Henry Brown, Henry Nesbitt and the Earl of Malmesbury Due to its relative slimness, Curtis recommended that the indexes be placed at the end of Volume VII. However, most systematic bindings have the general indexes more conventionally placed at the end of Volume VIII.  Publication history  ;First edition Announcement in the Somerset House Gazette, Volume I, January 1824: The initial subscribers' list comprised 167 names, of whom 87 were committing to take the entire work even though the total size and final publication date were then unknown. Publication commenced as announced with a proposed print run of 200 copies of each part to be issued monthly over 16 years as annual volumes each of 12 parts ‚Äì 192 parts in all. Each monthly part to comprise three or more, usually four, plates with accompanying text. By January 1839 the list of subscribers had fallen to 142. Of the original subscribers, only 31 eventually purchased all 192 first-edition parts on the day of issue and of these, three were joint-subscribers for a single set and two others each purchased two sets. Curtis's set is known to have included the later reprints of parts 1 to 8. The final subscribers' list of January 1840 shows that two complete sets were sold in December 1839 to previously unrecorded subscribers, \\"G. Folliott Esq., Chester (proofs)\\" and \\"Mrs Butler, Vicar's Cross\\". Curiously, at the time the only occupied dwelling at Vicar's Cross was the mansion owned and occupied by George Folliott and his immediate family and servants, none of whom was named Butler. The Butler set almost certainly included all the reprints. A complete, sixteen-volume, chronologically bound set was sold from Curtis's estate on 8 June 1863 (John C. Stevens, auctioneer, King Street, Covent Garden, London ‚Äì Lot 54) but it is not known whether or not this exclusively comprised first-edition parts ‚Äì it could be the harlequin set now with the British Entomological Society. The same sale also included an incomplete set of five volumes (Lot 55), a quantity of faulty prints (Lot 93) and a large quantity of good, loose coloured plates (Lot 95). At most, including proofs, just 32 complete first-edition sets, free of reprints, are definitely known to have been issued. ;Proof impressions: Plate 626, proof and normal impressions Detail from proof Plate 717, sycamore scale-insect, Coccus aceris In spite of the finely detailed illustrations being more suited to steel-plate engraving, copper was used throughout. Curtis gives no clue as to why he made this choice. Copper plates noticeably degrade after as few as 50 impressions and so the earlier impressions, especially the proof sets, are of significantly higher quality and more finely detailed than those that followed. Four complete sets of proof impressions, personally coloured by Curtis, were produced. These were sold at a considerable premium; one to Michael Bland of Paddington, London, and one to George Folliott of Vicar's Cross, Cheshire. The remaining two being taken by James Wadmore of Chapel Street, London. A proof set can most easily be identified by reference to plate 717 (sycamore scale-insect - Coccus aceris), the first plate in Volume VII of a systematically bound set. The two setae of this insect are each delineated by two clearly separated, very fine lines; the left most of which is so fine as to be barely visible. Curtis significantly emboldened these lines for the standard impressions. ;Reprint of Parts 1 to 8 (plates 1‚Äì34) and Parts 9 to 30: Demand from later, new subscribers required Curtis retrospectively to print at least an additional 72 sets of parts 1 to 30. This reprinting commenced in January 1829 and continued until 1840 and was concurrent with the printing of the remaining parts 31 to 192 of the first edition which were increased in number to accommodate the additional demand. Reprints of the plates and text of parts 1 to 8 (plates 1 to 34) can be all identified by an underscore to the plate number and in the case of plate 30, also by the addition of the systematic reference number 283. The text was comprehensively rewritten and reset with changes to nomenclature that later caused taxonomists some confusion since the dates on the accompanying plates were left unchanged. Parts 9 to 30 were reset and reprinted without material alteration except for an underscore to some of the plate numbers. The reprinted plates and many of the plates from parts 31 to 192 show evidence of the finer details having been reworked and are noticeably coarsened as a result. ;Total production In January 1840 Curtis stated in the heading of the final List of Subscribers that; \\"It is impossible to complete the sets belonging to the Parties ... having only taken a few of the early volumes\\" indicating that he had ceased production of plates and parts and sold out of essential back copies. This list shows a final total output of 216 completed sets including proofs and reprints. Curtis's personal copy brings the total to 217. The list also shows that 54 partial sets were issued. To these figures should be added an unknown quantity of individual parts and plates sold separately. Therefore, total production was in excess of 210,000 plates, most of which were coloured. A monumental undertaking requiring an output of 44 fully finished plates and associated text every working day for 16 years. ;Original costs and prices: As a footnote to the preface issued with the final part in December 1839, John Curtis wrote: \\"To enable those who are ignorant of the nature of such undertakings, to form some conception of their risk and magnitude, it may be here stated, that the colouring alone of the Plates has already cost upwards of ¬£3000\\", equivalent to ¬£350,000 today (2017, Bank of England Sterling Index). Those subscribing for all 192 coloured parts were committing to a total purchase price of ¬£43.4s.0d., approximately the average annual income for a family living in London with husband, wife and one child working. ;Lovell Reeves Edition: In 1862, Lovell Reeves published a partial reprint of the text and plates, the full details of which are now unknown except that all the plates were hand-coloured, lithographic copies easily identifiable today by their inferior quality with the dissection line drawings enlarged and randomly relocated. Plates and text from this reprint can sometime be found making up what would otherwise be an incomplete original set (see below). This edition was promoted in North America where Curtis had made no attempt to sell the original work.

The criticism outlined in the penultimate paragraph was entirely unjustified as Curtis was well aware of the danger and modified Jacob H√ºbner's slightly exaggerated and somewhat crudely rendered original drawings so as to portray the true characteristics of the British subspecies. At no time since has any entomologist supported the criticism or made comment as to the inaccuracy of the colouring or size of the larval depictions.

Hartley Durrant. 1 March 1911. Note: The drawings were shortly thereafter withdrawn from sale and given to the British Museum. As of January 2018, of the known, surviving bound sets, that held by the Natural History Museum, London (subscribed for by the Earl of Sheffield) originally comprised second edition versions of parts 1 - 30 but was corrected some time prior to 1911 by the separate acquisition of a first edition of Volume I. The set belonging to the Linnaen Society is all good except that it contains a number of uncoloured illustrations. The copy held by The British Library is reportedly made up from many sources and editions. Another at The Smithsonian is made up from three part sets, lacks 117 plates with 3 plates uncoloured but is in reasonable overall condition. An apparently complete set of first edition plates and text, systematically arranged and bound in contemporary half calf covers is held by Kings College, London. It is in generally good condition but suffers strong paper toning and appears mainly to comprise end-of-run impressions as they are all very coarse and lack much of the finest detail. Curtis's own set, now with the Royal Entomological Society, includes all the reprints. A reportedly complete set, chronologically bound in 16 volumes, is held by Melbourne Museum. It was acquired by the museum in July, 1857 (via MacMillan of London), but its condition and make-up have not yet been investigated. Another set is held by the National Library of Ireland, another is to be found in the London library of the Royal Horticultural Society and a third by the Ulster Museum once belonged to George Crawford Hyndman. Two copies are catalogued by University of California, Berkeley libraries; one of which is incomplete, mis-bound, with reprints and at least one duplication (plate 638). Their second copy has not been located. Two allegedly complete first-edition sets were recently sold at auction in Hamburg, Germany. Firstly, in May 2015, a set in good condition within modest, slightly damaged half-leather bindings formerly owned by John Waterhouse of Halifax, astronomer (not a subscriber) and secondly, on 20 November 2017, a reasonable set but with worn half-leather covers, provenance not disclosed. The whereabouts of these two are currently unknown. It is possible that they are both the same set, having suffered somewhat in the intervening thirty months. Two complete, systematically arranged first-edition proof sets are in a private library in West Sussex, England. The first is one of the two sets subscribed for by James Wadmore of Paddington. It bears later ownership stamps; \\"T.H.T. Hopkins Magd: Coll: Oxford\\" for Thomas Henry Toovey Hopkins (1831‚Äì1885) at the College of St. Mary Magdalen, Oxford, England. This set, bound in green half morocco and faux buckram bindings, is in excellent condition . The second, formerly at the Edge Hall Library, Malpas, Cheshire, England was originally purchased, as a complete set, directly from Curtis in December 1839, by George Folliott (1801-1851) of Vicar's Cross House, Chester. On Folliott's death in 1851 it passed to his close friends, the Dod family (specifically; Frances Rosamond Dod) at nearby Edge and thence by descent to Mr. A.K. Wolley Dod whose Residuary Trust disposed of the more important works in the Edge Hall Library via auction in 2017 whence it was acquired by the present owner. It was not described in the catalogue as being a proof set. It is the finest known survivor with contemporary bindings by White of Pall Mall in green, full morocco leather with triple-edge page gilding and inner gilt dentelles. The remaining two proof sets, if they have survived, remain to be discovered. All other known, surviving complete sets appear to include reprints and lithographed substitutes making up the shortfalls. Those listed as being in American universities usually comprise the 1862 lithographic reprints, either that or their catalogues are referring to one of the harlequin copies held either by the U.C. Berkeley or the Ernst Mayer Library or the on-line copies freely accessible via the Biodiversity Heritage Library. In March 1911, after a lengthy search, C. Davies Sherborn and J. Hartley Durrant of The Entomological Society of London could locate only one properly complete set free of reprints and lithographed replacements, namely that held by the Linnaen Society library (see above). In 1947 Richard E. Blackwelder investigated the five sets then known to be held in the United States, the results of his enquiries were published by The Smithsonian as the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Volume 107, Number 5, entitled \\"The Dates and Editions of Curtis' British Entomology\\". All five sets examined by Blackwelder were found to be made-up, including several lithographed copy plates. As of 1 December 2019, eleven, complete, original, first edition copies, two with partially coloured plates, have been located and positively identified. Beyond these there are twenty other known examples, either incomplete or made up from later editions and reprints. The finest, most accurately illustrated and precisely coloured entomological (and botanical) publication ever produced is now also one of the rarest.

Davies (27 June 1895 - 3 January 1973), was an English motorcycle racing champion, motorcycle designer and originator of the 'HRD' marque which later became Vincent-HRD motorcycles. He died in January 1973. Early life Howard Raymond Davies was born at 351 Ladypool Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham. His parents, Frank and Bertha, then moved to Wolverhampton where Howard attended Wolverhampton Municipal Grammar School. He was a good swimmer, won swimming medals, rode horses and hunted, and drummed in a band. When Davies left school he became an apprentice with AJS. He gained motorcycle building experience, but really wanted to go racing. AJS were fully occupied filling orders at the time and racing had no priority. Sunbeam had a good racing team, but had a no-staff-poaching agreement with AJS, so Davies moved to Clyno as a tester, and shortly thereafter moved to Sunbeam. Racing for Sunbeam The Sunbeam team of 1914 consisted of Tommy de la Hay, Vernon Busby, Howard Davies, and Charlie Noakes. Howard was entered in the Scottish Six Days Trial on a 6 hp AJS V-twin combination. He did well initially, but damaged his frame on the fourth day. He stayed for the rest of the event, but found on his return to work that such behaviour was not tolerated, and was sacked. Davies worked briefly for Diamond before managing to find his way back to Sunbeam. He was then entered for the Senior race at the 1914 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy (TT). He finished in second place, and Sunbeam won the team prize. He did well in other events that year, like the Coventry and Warwick Club trial. Davies won a gold cup for best performance of the day, and a silver cup for best sidecar performance. Davies and his family lived at 'Darley Dale', Crowther Road, Wolverhampton at the time. War Service Royal Flying Corps cap badge When World War I broke out, Davies joined the army and reported to Aldershot in early October to join the Royal Engineers. For 12 months he served as a despatch rider and served in France. On return to England he was given a Commission and posted to Dunstable. He then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, where he gained a Royal Aero Club Pilot's Certificate, at the Ruislip Military School on 29 July 1916, and was promptly posted to France. He flew RE8 aircraft for 34 Squadron, at Villers-Bretonneux, artillery spotting and was shot down twice. On the first occasion he found his way back to his own lines, but the second time he and Lieutenant J R Samuel were captured at Karlsruhe becoming prisoners of war. Initially listed as missing, it was then announced that he had been killed in action. An obituary appeared in May, 1917 in Motor Cycling magazine, whereupon it emerged that Howard had actually been taken prisoner. He attempted to escape a number of times, once by tunnel, but was unsuccessful. Racing for AJS Returning to England after the War he was demobilised in June 1919. His first post-War job was with Aston Motor Accessories of Wolverhampton. He then moved to AMAC Carburettors and began again to ride part-time for AJS. He joined the AJS team for the 1920 Isle of Man TT, and was entered for both the Junior and Senior. The 2.75 hp AJS machines suffered engine problems and he had to retire early in both events with broken valves. In 1920 Davies had many competition successes. In July, riding an AJS in the Scottish Six Day trial, he won the gold medal at Stile Kop, making the fastest time, won another gold medal in the Darlington ACU trial, and broke 14 records at Brooklands, including flying kilometre, flying mile, and average mean speed. By the end of the year, Davies became the full- time AJS Competitions Manager. He became involved in TT machine development, and by early 1921 the TT machinery was much improved. The 1921 AJS team obtained 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th places in the Junior 1921 TT event. The winner was Eric Williams. Davies finished in second place, even after having a puncture in the second lap. He finished first in the Senior TT on a 350, a full two minutes ahead of the runner-up, Freddie Dixon on an 'Indian'. This was the first time a 350 cc motorcycle won the Senior. In trials, Davies won the team event, with Harry Harris and Eric Williams in the ACU six day and the gold medal. On 24 May 1921, Davies broke four world records at Brooklands: *50 miles at 66.5 mph *1 hour at 66.09 mph *100 miles at 64.68 mph *2 hours at 65.3 mph The 1922 and 1923 TTs, however, were disasters. With the AJS machines suffering engine problems, he did not manage to finish a race. Davies left AJS in 1923 and moved to Hutchinson Tyres. Freelance He accepted an offer to ride an OEC in the 1924 TT, but the machine failed after only three laps. HRD Motors He had often thought of building his own motorcycle, and perhaps influenced by the many mechanical failures he had racing the bikes of the day, decided to make his own. Howard left Hutchinson Tyres in August 1924 to set up HRD Motors using the slogan \\"Built by a Rider\\". The company survived for just over three years. Davies rode his own motorcycles at the 1925 Isle of Man TT, coming second in the Junior and winning the Senior. In January 1928, the company went into voluntary liquidation. The name was purchased by Phil Vincent, who then established a new venture as Vincent-HRD. After HRD After HRD Motors closed, Davies went through a number of motor industry jobs. He worked first at Alvis, then Meadows Engines, and then Bill Lyon's Swallow and Coachbuilding Company at Coventry. He went into business as a manufacturers agent, covering cars, motorcycles and allied industries. By this time he was living in Southbank Road, Kenilworth. Later, he would move to his final home in Warwick Road, Chadwick End, Solihull. He continued to attend TT riders reunions, which started in 1937, and would visit Mallory Park with Albert Clarke. On one of these occasions he got to ride on the track, on an HRD model HD75 and an AJS. At the Last Davies died at home on 3 January 1973, of cancer. His wife Maisie died two days later. They had a joint funeral at the Robin Hood Crematorium in Solihull.

Timeform commented \\"will stay 1¬º miles; sure to go on to much better things.\\" Racing at age three on the turf, under jockey Michael Kinane he won the Ballysax Stakes and the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. In The Derby he was ridden by Lester Piggott and finished seventh behind Slip Anchor. He was re- united with Kinane for the Irish Sweeps Derby in which he finished second to Law Society, but then ran unplaced behind Commanche Run in the Irish Champion Stakes. Late in the year, he was sent to the United States to compete in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York City, where he finished eleventh. Theatrical returned to race in the 1986 Turf, where the heavily favored Dancing Brave finished fourth. Theatrical was beaten by a neck in finishing second to Manila. In 1987, Theatrical was brought to the United States and conditioned by new trainer Bill Mott. Under the future Hall of Fame trainer, the colt won the Hialeah Turf Cup Handicap and the Turf Classic Invitational Stakes. He also defeated Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Trempolino to win the Breeders' Cup Turf and claim the Eclipse Award for American Champion Male Turf Horse. Stud record In 1988 Theatrical stood at stud at Hill 'n' Dale Farms near Lexington, Kentucky. He was pensioned October 13, 2009, due to the infirmities of old age coupled with declining fertility. He has sired 18 Grade I stakes race winners, and his progeny have earned more than $65 million in purse money. Among his progeny, Theatrical sired Media Puzzle, the 2002 Melbourne Cup winner, Zagreb (Irish Derby), and Royal Anthem, whose wins include the Canadian International Stakes (1998) and the International Stakes (1999). Theatrical was also the damsire of Rail Link, winner of the 2006 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and Sir Mowgli XVII, four-time winning thoroughbred sired by Thunder Gulch. Sir Mowgli XVII is now a leading Hunter competing throughout the Southwest, having recently relocated to Durango Farms in Coto de Caza, CA. Theatrical was retired from stud in 2009 and lived the remainder of his life as a pensioner at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Lexington, Kentucky.

Born in Paris, de Thou was a son of Augustin de Thou (d. 1544), Pr√©sident of the Parlement de Paris; brother to Christophe de Thou (1508‚Äì82), who became Premier Pr√©sident of the Parlement de Paris; and later, uncle to noted historian Jacques-Auguste de Thou. De Thou became a canon of the Cathedral of Paris in 1547, and Bishop of Chartres by a bull of 8 April 1573. As bishop, he played a prominent role in the War of the Three Henrys (1584-1598), in which power was transferred from Henry III of France to Henry of Navarre, who then became Henry IV. His antipathy for the Catholic League, shared by his brother Pr√©sident Christophe de Thou, made his position difficult when the people of Chartres, who were devoted to the League, shut their gates to the troops of King Henry III on 17 January 1589 and subsequently welcomed Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, recognizing the aged Cardinal de Bourbon as king. Nicholas de Thou temporised, and on 20 April 1591 received in his place Henry of Navarre, the future Henry IV. On 21 September 1591 he attended the assembly of bishops, which declared \\"null, unjust and suggested by the malice of the enemies of France\\" Pope Gregory XIV's Bull of Excommunication against Henry of Navarre, and on 25 July 1593 he assisted at Henry IV's abjuration in St.-Denis. As Reims was still in the power of the Duke of Mayenne, Chartres was chosen for the coronation. To end the dispute with Renaud de Beaune, Archbishop of Bourges, who had just been appointed Archbishop of Sens and who claimed the honour of anointing the king, de Thou by a skillful move had himself appointed by Nicolas de Pellev√©, the Archbishop of Reims, as his representative and was thus commissioned to proceed with the coronation. Instead of the Sainte Ampoule there was brought from Tours a miraculous oil preserved in Marmoutier Abbey. The anointing took place on 27 February 1594, and the next day Nicolas de Thou bestowed on the king the Collar of the Order of the Holy Ghost. De Thou died at Villebon-sur-Yvette on 5 November 1598. He left various pastoral writings and a book entitled C√©r√©monies observ√©es au sacre et couronnement d'Henri IV, roi de France.

Prado was also in four other finals: placing fourth in the 200-metre butterfly (beating the South American record), and eighth in the 200-metre individual medley, the 200-metre backstroke, and the 4√ó100-metre medley. Prado had chances to earn a good result also in the 200-metre individual medley, but the conditions were adverse in Ecuador. \\"The hotel we stayed at was not well attended. It was directly across [from] the Guayaquil bus station. I managed to reach the final of the 200-metre individual medley, but I was weak because food there was terrible, and finished the race in eighth place.\\" Prado landed at home with gold on his neck but a big mycosis in his belly. Djan Madruga had worse luck: he contracted typhoid fever. At the 1983 Summer Universiade, in Edmonton, Prado won two bronze medals: in the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley races. He also finished fourth in the 200-metre backstroke, and sixth in the 200-metre butterfly. Prado competed at the 1983 Pan American Games, in Caracas, where he won two gold medals in the 200-metre and 400-metre individual medley (beating the Pan Am Games record). He also won two silver medals: in the 200-metre backstroke, and in the 200-metre butterfly (both beating the South American record). Prado won the silver medal in the men's 400-metre individual medley at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. He also finished fourth in the 200-metre backstroke, 12th in the 4√ó100-metre medley, and 17th in the 200-metre individual medley and the 200-metre butterfly. Prado participated in the 1985 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, the first year of the competition, where he won the gold medal in the 400-metre individual medley, and the bronze medal in the 200-metre butterfly. He also finished fourth in the 200-metre backstroke. At the 1985 Summer Universiade, in Kobe, Prado won the gold medal in the 400-metre individual medley and the bronze medal in the 200-metre individual medley. He also finished fourth in the 200-metre backstroke and in the 200-metre butterfly. At the 1986 World Aquatics Championships in Madrid, Prado competed in the 200-metre individual medley final, finishing seventh. Although feeling the exhaustion of years of competition, Prado still swam at the 1987 Pan American Games, in Indianapolis, where he won a silver medal in the 200-metre backstroke, and two bronze medals in the 200-metre individual medley and the 4√ó100-metre medley. Prado began to decline after losing the gold in Los Angeles 1984 to Alex Baumann. In 1987, Prado felt tired with his star status. During that year, he still swam well, earning medals in the Pan American Games, and spoke to journalists about training for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. In early 1988, Prado's positive diagnosis for hepatitis marked the inevitable. Prado said goodbye to competitive swimming after racing for 23 years. Marks and records In addition to beating the world record of the 400-metre individual medley, Prado held five South American individual records at the same time, at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas. At this competition, he broke Djan Madruga South American record in the 200-metre backstroke, with a time of 2:02.85. This record would not be broken until the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul by Rog√©rio Romero, with a time of 2:02.26 in the heats. In Caracas, he also broke the South American record for the 200-metre butterfly, with a time of 1:59.00. This record was not beaten until 2003, 20 years later, by Kaio Almeida. Prado broke the South American record in the 400-metre individual medley at the 1984 Summer Olympics, with a time of 4:18.45. This record was only beaten 20 years later, in 2004 by Thiago Pereira. In the 200-metre individual medley, Prado broke the South American record in Clovis, California, in 1983, with a time of 2:04.10. This record lasted 20 years and was beaten in 2003 by Diogo Yabe. After professional swimming In 2003, at 38 years old, Prado suffered a heart attack, and later had an angioplasty procedure at a hospital in Dallas, Texas. Prado served as sports manager of the Organizing Committee of the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. As of 2013, he works as sporting director of the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center in Rio de Janeiro. Prado graduated with a Masters in Economics and in Physical education from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. In addition to his work at the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center, he currently works as a swimming coach team in Hebraica Club/Projeto Futuro. He is also a swimming commentator for the pay-TV channel ESPN Brasil.

The transformation is called \\"whitening\\" because it changes the input vector into a white noise vector. Several other transformations are closely related to whitening: # the decorrelation transform removes only the correlations but leaves variances intact, # the standardization transform sets variances to 1 but leaves correlations intact, # a coloring transformation transforms a vector of white random variables into a random vector with a specified covariance matrix.  Definition  Suppose X is a random (column) vector with non-singular covariance matrix \\\\Sigma and mean 0. Then the transformation Y = W X with a whitening matrix W satisfying the condition W^\\\\mathrm{T} W = \\\\Sigma^{-1} yields the whitened random vector Y with unit diagonal covariance. There are infinitely many possible whitening matrices W that all satisfy the above condition. Commonly used choices are W = \\\\Sigma^{-1/2} (Mahalanobis or ZCA whitening), the Cholesky decomposition of \\\\Sigma^{-1} (Cholesky whitening), or the eigen-system of \\\\Sigma (PCA whitening). Optimal whitening transforms can be singled out by investigating the cross-covariance and cross- correlation of X and Y. For example, the unique optimal whitening transformation achieving maximal component-wise correlation between original X and whitened Y is produced by the whitening matrix W = P^{-1/2} V^{-1/2} where P is the correlation matrix and V the variance matrix.  Whitening a data matrix  Whitening a data matrix follows the same transformation as for random variables. An empirical whitening transform is obtained by estimating the covariance (e.g. by maximum likelihood) and subsequently constructing a corresponding estimated whitening matrix (e.g. by Cholesky decomposition).  R implementation  An implementation of several whitening procedures in R, including ZCA-whitening and PCA whitening but also CCA whitening, is available in the \\"whitening\\" R package published on CRAN.

Life Early life A student at the royal coll√®ge at La Fl√®che, he became a lieutenant in 1788 and rose to adjutant-general and lieutenant- colonel in 1792. He fought at the Battle of Valmy on 20 September 1792 and was made general de brigade and chief of staff to the Army of Moselle the following March. He then distinguished himself at the Battle of Kaiserslautern. However, he was then suspended and imprisoned as a noble and thus as a suspect, but was freed on 9 Thermidor year II (27 July 1794), brought back into the army at the rank of general of brigade and sent to the Army of the Coasts of Cherbourg (then at Brest). He became general of division in November 1795 and the Cherbourg army's chief of staff in January 1795, under Lazare Hoche. Under Hoche's orders he carried out a policy of pacification and appeasement in the west, which had revolted against the Republican regime. He temporarily commanded the Army of the Coasts of the Ocean in place of Hoche from 10 July to mid-August 1796. Saint-Domingue He served on Saint-Domingue in 1798, where he had been sent as governor during Sonthonax's second commission. He encouraged the dissension between Andr√© Rigaud and Toussaint Louverture which helped to fuel the Haitian Revolution. Toussaint's military leadership during the Haitian Revolution resulted in the rebellious slaves gaining the upper hand and restoring most of Saint-Domingue to France. Now that he ruled the island, Toussaint did not wish to surrender power to France and continued to effectively rule the country autonomously. H√©douville was one of the rivals to power whom Toussaint had to overcome. H√©douville was eventually forced to flee. However, before he left, he released Andr√© Rigaud from Toussaint's leadership. Consulate to Restoration After his time on Saint-Domingue, H√©douville was employed by the Arm√©e d'Angleterre before returning to western France in January 1800 to take over from Hoche as commander-in-chief of the Army of the West He again negotiated a peace settlement with the Royalists. He was appointed as the Consulate's minister plenipotentiary at Saint Petersburg, Russia, from 1801 to 1804, when the Tsar broke relations with France. H√©douville left Saint Petersburg 7 June 1804.

This reduces the mechanical stress on the motor and shaft, as well as the electrodynamic stresses on the attached power cables and electrical distribution network, extending the lifespan of the system. It can consist of mechanical or electrical devices, or a combination of both. Mechanical soft starters include clutches and several types of couplings using a fluid, magnetic forces, or steel shot to transmit torque, similar to other forms of torque limiter. Electrical soft starters can be any control system that reduces the torque by temporarily reducing the voltage or current input, or a device that temporarily alters how the motor is connected in the electric circuit. Digital Soft Starter Across-the line starting of induction motors is accompanied by inrush currents up to 7-10 times higher than running current (inrush current can reach levels of 10 -15 times for higher efficiency motors), and starting torque up to 3 times higher than running torque. The increased torque results in sudden mechanical stress on the machine which leads to a reduced service life. Moreover, the high inrush current stresses the power supply, which may lead to voltage dips. As a result, lifespan of sensitive equipment may be reduced. Another common side-effect, especially in residential installations, is that of light flickering as a result of the voltage sag created by the high inrush current. A soft starter eliminates the undesired side effects. Several types based on control of the supply voltage or mechanical devices such as slip clutches were developed. Torque surges entail high mechanical stress on the machine, which results in higher service costs and increased wear. High currents and current peaks lead to high fixed costs charged by the power supply companies (peak current calculation) and to increased mains and generator loads. A soft starter continuously controls the three-phase motor's voltage supply during the start-up phase. This way, the motor is adjusted to the machine's load behavior. Mechanical operating equipment is accelerated smoothly. This lengthens service life, improves operating behavior, and smooths work flows. Electrical soft starters can use solid state devices to control the current flow and therefore the voltage applied to the motor. They can be connected in series with the line voltage applied to the motor, or can be connected inside the delta (Œî) loop of a delta-connected motor, controlling the voltage applied to each winding. Solid state soft starters can control one or more phases of the voltage applied to the induction motor with the best results achieved by three-phase control. Soft starters controlled via two phases have the disadvantage that the uncontrolled phase will always shows some current unbalance with respect to the controlled phases.Typically, the voltage is controlled by reverse-parallel-connected silicon-controlled rectifiers (thyristors), but in some circumstances with three-phase control, the control elements can be a reverse-parallel-connected SCR and diode. Another way to limit motor starting current is a series reactor. If an air core is used for the series reactor then a very efficient and reliable soft starter can be designed which is suitable for all types of 3 phase induction motor [ synchronous / asynchronous ] ranging from 25 kW 415 V to 30 MW 11 kV. Using an air core series reactor soft starter is very common practice for applications like pump, compressor, fan etc. Usually high starting torque applications do not use this method. Applications Soft starters can be set up to the requirements of the individual application. Compared to variable- frequency drives, soft starters require very few user adjustments. Some soft starters also include a \\"learning\\" process to automatically adapt the drive settings to the characteristics of a motor load, to reduce the power inrush requirement at the start. In pump applications, a soft starter can avoid pressure surges, also known as water hammering. Conveyor belt systems can be smoothly started, avoiding jerk and stress on drive components. Fans or other systems with belt drives can be started slowly to avoid belt slipping as well as air pressure surges. Soft starters are seen in electrical R/C helicopters, and allow the rotor blades to spool-up in a smooth, controlled manner rather than a sudden surge. In all systems, a soft start limits the inrush current and so improves stability of the power supply and reduces transient voltage drops that may affect other loads.

In 1604 he inherited a part of Hessen-Marburg after the death of Louis IV of Hesse-Marburg who was childless. The other half went to Maurice of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), but since Maurice was a Calvinist, Ludwig claimed a right on the whole of Hesse-Marburg. Lutheran professors of the University of Marburg who refused to convert to Calvinism founded in 1607 the University of Gie√üen which was named Ludoviciana. This led to a conflict during the Thirty Years' War, between Louis V, who stood on the side of the Emperor, and Maurice, who was on the side of the Protestants. Hesse-Darmstadt suffered severely from the ravages from the Swedes during the conflict. The Landgrave died in 1626 and he was succeeded by George II, Landgrave of Hesse- Darmstadt.

As of 2019‚Äì20, Oklahoma State wrestling has won 34 team national championships, 142 individual NCAA championships, and 467 All- American honors.2019-20 Cowboy Wrestling Media Guide - Oklahoma State. Retrieved Aug 22, 2020. History Cowboy wrestling extends back to 1914‚Äì15 when A.M. Colville led the first team at what was then Oklahoma A&M.; That team lost the school's first dual meet to Texas. The next season, athletic director Edward C. Gallagher would take over the team. He coached the first national championship team in 1928. He was also the coach of eight of the first ten national champions as his teams won in 1928, 1929, 1930, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. Only a strong 1936 Oklahoma team coached by Paul Keen kept him from sweeping the first 10 official NCAA Championships. He coached 50 official All-Americans and 26 official individual champions in the earliest days of the tournament. Following Gallagher's death in 1940, A&M; to find a coach who could continue their winning tradition. For that task, the Cowboys turned to Art Griffith, longtime coach at Central High School in Tulsa. In 15 years, Griffith he won 94 of 100 matches, including 50 in a row at one point. Once he arrived in Stillwater, Griffith picked up where Gallagher left off, winning eight national championships in 13 years. He also continued two streaks left by Gallagher. First, he extended the four consecutive championships Gallagher had left with to seven, finally losing out in 1947 to Cornell. Second, he extended the 27 consecutive dual meet victory streak to 76, before finally losing in 1951. Griffith's wrestlers won 27 individual championships and were All-Americans 64 times from 1941‚Äì1956. He retired on top after winning three consecutive NCAA Championships and going 78-7-4 for his career, including ten undefeated teams. One of Griffith's wrestlers, Myron Roderick, was chosen to immediately succeed his former coach following his retirement in 1956. As a wrestler for Griffith, Roderick went 42‚Äì2 and became a three-time national champion from 1954‚Äì1956. After he returned from the 1956 Olympics, he took over as head coach. His first team was one of his least successful, finishing fourth at nationals with only one champion and three All-Americans to his credit. However, his 1957‚Äì58 and 1958‚Äì59 teams dominated the NCAA tournament, winning in convincing fashion with four champions and 15 All-Americans between the two years. His 1960 team couldn't compete with a much stronger Oklahoma team coached by Thomas Evans. However, Roderick's teams once again rebounded with championship wins in 1961 and 1962, winning five individual championships and another 15 All-Americans. By the end of his career in 1969, he had coached seven team champions, 20 individual champions, and 79 All-Americans. The dual success continued into the 1970s and 80s, with Tommy Chesbro leading the way from 1969-84. However, the NCAA title train ended during this time. He only won one national title, in part because his tenure mostly coincided with the sudden rise of Iowa wrestling under Dan Gable. The Cowboys won only one title under Chesbro‚Äôs watch. Still, Chesbro managed to pass Gallagher as the winningest coach in school history. His dual mark of 227-26-0 would remain the best record in the history of the program until it was surpassed by current coach John Smith. Smith took over the Cowboy wrestling program in 1991 in the wake of NCAA sanctions and probation left over from previous head coach Joe Seay, who had won two national titles with a 114-18-2 overall record. Smith‚Äôs first season saw the Cowboys take second at Nationals, but his second season was crippled by the probation. The Pokes went 4‚Äì7 and were banned from post-season competition. But the next season, the Cowboys were back as top wrestlers who had taken a redshirt year during the probation (such as four-time champion, and current assistant coach Pat Smith and Alan Fried) were back on the mat. OSU went 13‚Äì1 that year and won the team title. The middle part of the 90s, however, saw the OSU program grow somewhat stagnant, at least by Cowboy standards. Wrestlers were still winning individual titles and claiming All- American honors and the team was still winning Big Eight and Big 12 Conference crowns, but their showings at Nationals were disappointing. Between 1995‚Äì2002, the Cowboys placed no better than second (once, in 1997) and finished third three times (1998, 1999, 2001). But in 2002, the Cowboys were back in the saddle once again, winning the conference and NCAA titles and sporting a 17‚Äì0 record. It would be the first of four straight national championships (2003‚Äì06), firmly reestablishing OSU's dominance in the wrestling world. The Cowboys were at their peak from 2002 to 2005, when they sported a combined record of 55‚Äì2. Smith currently has 239 wins as coach at OSU, the most ever in school history. Noteworthy alumni Oklahoma State has had a number of key wrestlers that have been crucial to strengthening their program throughout the years. Yojiro Uetake, an Oklahoma State wrestler originally from Japan, is a prime example of this. To this day, Uetake holds the title of the only Cowboy wrestler to remain undefeated throughout his entire college career, ending with a record of 58 wins and no losses. Also during his time as a 130-pound wrestler for OSU, Uetake won a total of three individual Big 8 and national championships. After graduating in Stillwater, Uetake was an assistant coach for the Cowboys for two years before moving back home to Japan, where he now coaches wrestling at the high school he attended. In 2015, Uetake was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Another key wrestler in the Cowboys' success is Alex Dieringer. Dieringer graduated from OSU in 2016, but earned many significant wins during his time in Stillwater.https://www.teamusa.org/Athletes/DI/Alex-Dieringer Between 2013 and 2016, he was not only a three-time NCAA champion, but also a four-time NCAA All-American and a four-time Big 12 champion. Dieringer was nominated for, but did not win, the ESPY award for Male College Athlete of the Year. He did, however, win the award for Oklahoma State Male Athlete of the Year in 2016. That same year, he won a Dan Hodge Trophy and ended his college career with 133 wins and only four losses. Since graduating from Oklahoma State, Dieringer placed third in the U.S. Olympic Trials, in the U.S. World Team Trials, and in the U.S. Open. Post graduate alum careers Oklahoma State has a history of alumni wrestlers and top UFC contenders throughout the years. Like current UFC Middleweight contender Mark Mu√±oz, the UFC Light-Heavyweight Champion Daniel Cormier, former UFC Welterweight Champion and current contender Johny Hendricks, and two-time former UFC Champion and UFC Hall of Fame member Randy Couture. Two decorated collegiate wrestlers, the Rosholt brothers, currently compete in Mixed Martial Arts are Jake Rosholt (3x NCAA Champion: '03, '05, & '06) and Jared Rosholt (2010 NCAA Finalist), as well as former UFC fighter Don Frye and Bellator fighter and former Strikeforce Champion Muhammed Lawal. Shane Roller retired from MMA in 2012 having earned NCAA All-American honors with the Cowboy Wrestling team, and then becoming an assistant coach with the program and gaining three NCAA team titles. Recent Big 12 successes Oklahoma State wrestling is known for its consistent success in the annual Big 12 championship tournament. Out of the 23 trophies won throughout the tournament's history, OSU has earned 17 of them. During this event in March of 2019, OSU won its seventh Big 12 team title in a row, making this the longest consecutive winning streak ever in Big 12 wrestling. This win also completed OSU's greatest amount of sequential conference tournament wins since their success in the 1920s. Home meets Home meets are held in the 13,611 seat Gallagher-Iba Arena in Stillwater. The arena is named in part after Oklahoma State's legendary wrestling coach Edward C. Gallagher. Gallagher-Iba was known as Gallagher Hall for nearly five decades until the name was amended to honor former Oklahoma State basketball coach Henry Iba upon the facility's first renovation during the 1987‚Äì1988 season. Oklahoma State has held their home wrestling meets in the arena since its completion in 1938. The arena was formally dedicated on February 3, 1939, during a wrestling dual versus Indiana. During the December 9, 2005 Bedlam wrestling dual, a permanently reserved seat for Gallagher was unveiled, adjacent to a reserved seat for Iba. The venerable arena has long played a part in the history and legends of the OSU wrestling program. It has long been known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation, a reputation made during its first half-century. During the 1978 Big 8 wrestling championships, a standing-room-only crowd of 8,300 made such a huge roar that many of the lights in the arena burst. Gallagher- Iba has also seen many long undefeated streaks for the Pokes, including 34 unbeaten and untied seasons at home. The home mat advantage for the Pokes and the ravenous attitude of Cowboy fans led to the arena's nickname \\"Gallagher's House of Horrors.\\" Gallagher-Iba underwent a massive renovation project in 2000 and 2001, which included an expansion of the seating capacity from 6,381 to the present 13,611. While the expansion project caused attendance at basketball games to almost double, the wrestling crowds have yet to pack the arena to the rafters as they did in the original Gallagher Hall. However, attendance usually spikes when rivals come to Stillwater, most notably the Iowa Hawkeyes, Minnesota Golden Gophers, and Bedlam foe Oklahoma. While the unruly atmosphere has been somewhat diminished, the renovation project has yielded positives for the Cowboy wrestling program. Among which are the new wrestling center and other new training facilities built inside the athletics center, much to the benefit all OSU student-athletes. Bedlam Despite the overwhelming mainstream popularity of the games played on the gridiron and hardwood, the Bedlam Series roots lie on the wrestling mat. In fact, the term 'Bedlam' used to describe this intrastate rivalry has its roots based in the rivalry that brewed between the schools' prestigious wrestling programs. The term is said to have been born on the night of a particularly heated wrestling dual in Stillwater at Gallagher Hall. As the story goes, a newspaper writer was said to have emerged from the building exclaiming to others outside, \\"It's bedlam in there!\\" Oklahoma State holds a seemingly insurmountable advantage in the wrestling series, which began in 1920. The Cowboys own an impressive 143-27-10 record against the Sooners through the 2019-20 season. While normally this sort of one-sided advantage can be attributed to one school being rather weak, the Bedlam domination by Oklahoma State is very different in that Oklahoma is a national wrestling power in its own right. Oklahoma has won seven team national championships in its history, while Oklahoma State has won a record 34 team national titles.http://www.ncaasports.com/wrestling/mens/history/divi This dominance over such a highly touted rival has long been a source of great pride for Oklahoma State fans. In recent years, Oklahoma has moved its home duals from the Lloyd Noble Center back to its former home, McCasland Field House, in part to prevent Cowboy fans from dominating the atmosphere despite being the visiting team.

History The festival was noteworthy because of the importance of the headliner bands that played and the timing in the evolution of new wave music, and from the size of the crowd. Tickets were $20 ($25 at the gate). 85,000 people attended but at 5 pm Dan Aykroyd, in character as Elwood Blues, during a live radio interview from backstage with friend and festival promoter John Brower, asked Brower if he could invite everyone listening to come out and be on his guest list. Brower immediately agreed and within 90 minutes another 15,000 people poured into the park swelling the crowd to almost 100,000 just as Talking Heads took the stage as the sun set. The crowd inched forward to accommodate the \\"guests\\" and a sense of wonder swept over everyone as no one other than Brower and Aykroyd and the radio audience was aware of the last minute free invitation.http://www.angelfire.com/rock/teenagehead/ShortArticles.htm from Trouser Press #56, Nov. 1980. Scandal plagued the event with accusations tossed back and forth between the backers and park management, the latter claiming to have thrown away all the ticket stubs as \\"no one told them to keep them\\". The event reportedly lost a million dollars.Losses: http://philbrodieband.com/music_trivia-yesterdays_august.htm Despite the fact that no rights agreements were signed, the entire concert was recorded professionally. The tapes surfaced sometime later that year and were secured by Brower after being turned over by the studio whose recording truck had been on location to record Teenage Head, the band. In the mid 1990s the tapes were handed over to Canadian independent record executive Jan Haust by Brower to ensure their professional restoration and safe keeping. 102 of those tracks, by the five most famous of the bands, were acquired by Wolfgangs, which also holds the rights to Bill \\"Wolfgang\\" Graham's archive; by 2017 they were posted on its website.https://www.wolfgangs.com/playlists/1249337.html A video recording of a portion of the set played by The Kings has also been released.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D0M9xgjntk At the time of the festival, a new wave/punk festival seemed a novel idea to many, especially as many of these bands typically played at night, in clubs‚Äînot outdoors in the hot summer sunlight.

The 'peas' are traditionally pigeon peas, but more often substituted with kidney beans, and the dish is frequently served with curry goat. In 1961, Frederic G. Cassidy made note that the dish had been referred to as Jamaica's coat of arms. Anglo-Caribbean Rice and peas is the mainstay of the cuisines of The Bahamas, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and many other English-speaking Caribbean islands. In The Bahamas, it is known as peas n' rice, from which the Bahamian folk song \\"Mamma don't want no Peas n' Rice and Coconut Oil\\" is named. Rice and peas derived from the Ghanaian rice based dish Waakye, which derived from enslaved West Africans during the Transatlantic slave trade. The dish is made with rice and any available legume, such as kidney beans, pigeon peas (known as gungo peas), or cowpeas, the combination of grain and a legume forming a complete protein; compare rice and beans. Gungo peas are particularly associated with Christmas. The peas are boiled with pimenta seeds and garlic until tender. Scotch bonnet pepper, thyme, scallions and/or round onions, grated ginger and coconut milk are then added along with the rice and left to simmer until cooked. Variations of the recipe include the use of salt pork or beef instead of salt. Chicken is also used in the Guyanese variations of this dish and is known as cookup rice. This flavors the dish well and reduces the need for additional protein. Rice and peas, the classic Sunday lunch dish, is usually served with a stewed meat, such as chicken, beef, lamb or pork, or fish or seafood such as shrimp, crab or king fish.

The route was previously known as Route 86 and was renumbered to avoid a numerical conflict with the designation of a freeway as Interstate 86 in the 1970s. Route 286 is the highest numbered New Hampshire state highway. Route description The western terminus of Route 286 is Interstate 95 in Salisbury, Massachusetts, where it is accessed via exit 60 on I-95. Traffic coming from I-95 uses Toll Road, while traffic going to I-95 uses Main Street. The divergence resolves at Pike Street, where Route 286 proceeds eastward, crossing U.S. Route 1 where it becomes Collins Street. After crossing into Seabrook, New Hampshire, Collins Street and Route 286 diverge at an intersection with South Main Street. Route 286 then continues to its eastern terminus with New Hampshire Route 1A (Ocean Boulevard), which runs north‚Äìsouth along the Atlantic shore, approximately north of the Massachusetts/New Hampshire state line. The total length of Route 286 is approximately , of which approximately are in New Hampshire and approximately are in Massachusetts. History 70px 70px70px Route 286 was formerly numbered 86 and renumbered to make room for I-86, which is now designated as part of I-84. Route 286 was previously designated as Route 86 in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Between 1971 and 1984, Massachusetts had an Interstate 86, which ran from Sturbridge, Massachusetts, to Hartford, Connecticut. The construction of I-86 prompted Massachusetts Route 86 to be renumbered to \\"286\\" because, according to Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) protocol, a state highway and an Interstate Highway may not share the same number. (The only exception to this rule is Massachusetts Route 295 and I-295, which are on opposite ends of the state.) When Massachusetts renumbered Route 86 to 286, New Hampshire matched the change on its section. In 1984, plans to connect I-84 along the present day I-384/US 6 corridor from Hartford to Providence were scuttled for environmental reasons. As a result, I-84 was rerouted onto the completed I-86 freeway. The existing section of the old I-84 became I-384. The Massachusetts State Route has kept the 286 number, and by extension the New Hampshire road has as well. Today, I-86 is the former Southern Tier Expressway/NY Route 17 in New York State as that road is upgraded to Interstate Highway standards. Modern I-86 is unrelated to the I-86 that existed in Massachusetts.

Fate/Zero is set ten years before the events of Fate/stay night, and tells the story of the Fourth Holy Grail War, a secret magical tournament held in Fuyuki City, Japan where seven mages known as Masters summon Servants, reincarnations of legendary souls and heroes from all across time, where they fight in a deadly battle royale where the winner obtains the Holy Grail, a magical legendary chalice capable of granting wishes. The main protagonist, Kiritsugu Emiya, the foster father of Fate/stay night's protagonist, Shirou Emiya, is known as a merciless mage killer who joins the tournament on behalf of his wife's family, the Einzberns. An anime adaptation has been produced by Ufotable, the first season of which aired from October 1 to December 24, 2011 and the second season of which aired from April 7 to June 23, 2012. A manga adaptation was published by Kadokawa Shoten between 2011 and 2017. Dark Horse Comics licensed the manga and released it in English in North America. Fate/Zero was praised for its animation, themes, characters, soundtrack and story. The series has also been a commercial success, selling over 40,000 BD box-set and won several awards at the Newtype anime awards including \\"Title of the Year\\". Plot The story of Fate/Zero takes place ten years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the Fourth Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The Holy Grail War is a contest, founded by the Einzbern, Matou, and Tohsaka families centuries ago, in which seven mages summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the \\"Holy Grail\\", which grants a wish to each member of the winning duo. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences. The Einzbern family is determined to achieve victory in the Fourth War after three consecutive failures, no matter the cost. As a result, they have elected to bring the notorious \\"mage killer\\", Kiritsugu Emiya, into their ranks, despite his methods and reputation as a skilled mercenary and a hitman who employs whatever he can use to accomplish his goals. Though Kiritsugu had once wanted to become a hero who could save everyone, he has long since abandoned this ideal upon realizing that saving one person often comes at the cost of another's life. Thus, this is the source of conflict, which he once sought to eliminate, due to finite resources/abilities. For the sake of humanity, he resolves to ruthlessly destroy anything and anyone who threatens the peace of others. However, Kiritsugu finds himself deeply torn between the love he has found for his new family ‚Äì his wife Irisviel and their daughter Illya ‚Äì and what he must do to obtain the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest who is trying to discover his true nature in his quest to find the Holy Grail, which is revealed to be monstrous and full of hate. He sets his sights on Kiritsugu as a kindred spirit and possible answer to the emptiness he feels. Towards the conclusion, the limitations of the \\"Holy Grail\\" are found to be in the fact that, while omnipotent in its wish-granting abilities, it is not omniscient, and therefore depends on the victor's knowledge and methods to determine the way by which the wish is carried out. And, to make things worse, the last war fought over the Grail has left it corrupted, causing any wish granted by the Grail to be a Monkey's Paw. Production and publication Urobuchi was pitched a prequel of Fate/stay night by Takashi Takeuchi. He believes that despite how tragic is the ending, the actual ending of the good ending of Fate/stay Night would not be affected thanks to the fact that Kiritsugu's life is a prequel. Already by writing the first volume, Urobuchi planned the series to end by its fourth volume. Nasu was amazed by Urobuchi and had already expected that, during 2002, he would write an interesting story. In 2002 when writing the first visual novel route of Fate/stay night, Nasu fell ill. During this illness, Nasu became impressed by Urobuchi's writing in the novel. Ideas like Saber being lectured by Gilgamesh and Alexander the Great gave him a bigger impact. When starting the project for Fate/Zero, Nasu decided to give Urobuchi complete freedom about Kiritsugu's characterization. The idea of Fate/Zero was proposed by writer Gen Urobuchi who wanted to write a new series under Nasu's guide. Urobuchi explained that 90% of the proposals were accepted by Nasu. During the original visual novel, Fate/stay night, Saber explains she made brief interactions with Kiritsugu Emiya which lead to the creation of the character of Irisviel. As Kiritsugu's wife, Irisviel plays the role of facilitating communication between these two, who do not talk to each other. The distanced and ultimately dark relationship between Kiritsugu and Saber caused by the former's actions in the story led Urobuchi and Nasu to change some early drafts in the story. This was in order to create a more coherent relationship between Saber and Shiro Emiya in the original visual novel as during the finale Kiritsugu adopts the child. Nasu was in charge of the use of magic rather than attempting to use real occultism. The ending of the novels brought Urobuchi difficulties to write as he wanted to distance it from typical stories but in the end decided to follow his own type of writing. During the characterization of the main characters, Urobuchi had no issues writing their ideologies, to the point of finding them as their own individuals. The first volume was released on December 29, 2006, and is a collaboration between Type-Moon and fellow developer Nitroplus. The second volume was released on March 31, 2007. The third volume was released on July 27, 2007. The fourth and final volume was released on December 29, 2007, along with the Fate/Zero Original Image Soundtrack \\"Return to Zero\\". Fate/Zero began as a light novel series written by Urobuchi with illustrations by Takashi Takeuchi. It is set as a prequel to Type-Moon's visual novel Fate/stay night. The first volume was released on December 12, 2006, and the fourth and final volume was released on December 29, 2007. Related media Drama CD Four sets of drama CDs were released from 2008 to 2010. A soundtrack entitled Return to Zero was released on December 31, 2007. Following the airing of the anime adaption, drama CDs written by Urobuchi were bundled with the series' Blu-Ray box sets released from 2011 to 2012. Anime The 2011 issue of Type-Moon Ace magazine reported that an anime adaption of Fate/Zero was green- lit for production. It is produced by studio Ufotable and began airing in October 2011. This is the third anime production in the Fate series, following the 24-episode 2006 adaptation and the 2010 Unlimited Blade Works film. Nico Nico Douga and Aniplex simulcasted Fate/Zero worldwide with eight different language subtitles, including Korean, Chinese (traditional and simplified), English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. The anime was originally slated to run continuously for all episodes, but was later given a season break between 13 and 14 to allow for better animation. The first season ran from October 1 to December 24, 2011 and the second season ran from April 7 to June 23, 2012. For the first cour, the opening theme is \\"oath sign\\" by LiSA whilst the ending theme is Memoria by Aoi Eir. For the second cour, the opening theme is \\"to the beginning\\" by Kalafina whilst the ending theme is by Luna Haruna. The ending theme for episodes 18-19 is by Kalafina. The series has been licensed in North America by Aniplex of America and features an English dub which ran on Viz Media's Neon Alley service. Manga Along with the anime production, a manga adaptation of Fate/Zero illustrated by Shinjir≈ç was serialized in Young Ace magazine between December 29, 2010 and June 2, 2017 and compiled in fourteen volumes. On September 1, 2014, during their Kumoricon panel, Dark Horse Comics announced that they had licensed the manga. They released the first volume in 2016. A parody manga, Fate/Zero Kuro by mendori was released in 2011 and 2012 in Altima Ace and then Monthly Asuka and compiled into one volume in 2013. Other An art book entitled Fate/Zero material was released on August 8, 2008. Published by Type-Moon, the book contains a compilation of the published and promotional art from the novel, detailed character profiles and memo sections, and an overview of the novel's plot. Two videogame adaptations for smartphones, Fate/Zero The Adventure and Fate/Zero Next Encounter, were released in Japan. In 2016, a special event entitled Fate/Accel Zero Order was held from 27 April to 11 May. The scenario was written by Gen Urobuchi and the animation was produced by ufotable. Reception Critical reception Fate/Zero received critical acclaim. Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network highly praised the series, describing it as \\"a treasure worth unearthing to its end\\" and concluded by writing: \\"Ambitious, brilliant, heartbreaking and masterfully crafted narrative, complex characters with powerful ideals, visually stunning, gorgeous score and strong cast in both languages.\\" Elliot Gay of Japanator was impressed by its pilot episode despite serving as an exposition for the masters, who he felt were more appealing than the ones from the original series thanks to Ufotable's work. UK Anime Network's Martin gave the first part a score 9 out of 10, and the second part a perfect score of 10 out of 10. Martin characterized the story as very dark and demanding and \\"a dramatic and satisfying conclusion to a solidly entertaining series.\\" T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the entire series a score of 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Aiden Foote believing Fate/Zero as \\"one of the most visually impressive TV series to date\\" and praised the \\"smooth animation and consistent artwork coming together to make crisp, evocative action scenes to get the heart racing.\\" Aiden also stated \\"the main reason why I really like the show is the time and effort that Urobuchi puts into the majority of the characters.\\" However, Aiden also criticizes the pacing stating that series' biggest problem was the \\"plot pacing\\". Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku praised the animation, themes and the characters backstories especially Kiritsugu's. Richard started the review by writing \\"Gen Urobuchi has written some of the most psychologically dark anime in recent memory. He is a master at subverting anime tropes to breathe new life into stale genres.\\" His final thoughts being \\"Fate/Zero is an excellent anime. It has dynamic, multifaceted characters, explores great philosophies and themes, and tops it off with large helpings of action. It also has the will to go deep into dark, psychological territory to improve both its characters and story.\\" Sales and accolades The first season's BD box set sold 43,000 copies in its first week, making it the highest-selling anime television Blu-ray box in first week-sales, breaking the record previously held by Haruhi Suzumiya. The second season's BD box set also topped Oricon's weekly sales, selling over 40,000 copies. Fate/Zero won multiple top prizes during the 2nd Newtype Anime Awards, including Title of the Year, Best Studio (for ufotable), Best Soundtrack, and Best CM. It placed second for Best Theme Song (\\"to the beginning\\"), Best Director, Best Character Design and Script. In the Best Male Character category, Rider placed first, Kiritsugu placed third and Gilgamesh placed eight. In Best Character for Female, Saber placed second. It received 2 nomination at the 2014 UK Anime Network Awards in Best action category and best dramatic anime category. It was also the runner-up for \\"UK Anime Awards - The Reader's Choice 2014\\". The light novel took sixth place in its respective category in the 2015 Sugoi Japan Awards. In 2019, Polygon named Fate/Zero as one of the best anime of the 2010s. Crunchyroll included the series among \\"Top 25 anime of the decade\\" list, with writer Azaly Zeldin calling it \\"one of the best anime series of the past decade\\". Zeldin wrote that the series is an \\"expensive, beautiful and smart action thriller that consolidated the glory of ufotable, Gen Urobuchi and Yuki Kajiura, and has become for the modern anime industry something similar to what The Dark Knight means for the current wave of comic book movies.\\" Writing for Comic Book Resources, Sage Ashford ranked it #8 on his list, stating that the \\"series is so important it revitalized the [Fate] franchise in the world of anime, resulting in multiple series and films that have continued even into 2019. IGN also listed Fate/Zero among the best anime of the decade, praising the series for its \\"dark, mature tale that doesn‚Äôt shy away from sensitive material\\" and for \\"having some of the best animation that lauded studio Ufotable has ever produced. It perfectly sets the stage for Fate/Stay Night, but beyond that, it also stands on its own as the perfect entry point into the series.\\" Thrillist named the series one of the best anime of the 2010s, with LB writing it's \\"tense and unforgiving; plus, there's some freaky bug magic that will surely get your skin crawling.\\" See also References External links * Type-Moon's Official Homepage for the Fate/stay night Game * Type-Moon's and Nitroplus' Official Homepage for Fate/Zero * Official Anime Website * Official US Website * Category:2006 Japanese novels Category:2011 anime television series Category:2011 manga Category:2012 anime television series Category:Action anime and manga Category:Anime and manga based on light novels Category:Anime composed by Yuki Kajiura Category:Aniplex Category:Cultural depictions of Arthurian legend Category:Dark fantasy anime and manga Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:Death games in fiction Category:Fate/stay night anime Category:Fate/stay night manga Category:Fate/stay night novels Category:Fiction set in 1994 Category:Light novels Category:Nitroplus Category:Seinen manga Category:Type-Moon Category:Ufotable ","title":"Fate/Zero"},{"id":"8145848","title":"Mogens Guldberg"},{"id":"8145900","text":"The Center for Missouri Studies in Columbia, Missouri is the headquarters of the society. The State Historical Society of Missouri, a private membership and state funded organization, is a comprehensive research facility located in Columbia, Missouri specializing in the preservation and study of Missouri's cultural heritage. Established in 1898 by the Missouri Press Association and made a trustee of the state in 1901, the Society is the official historical society of the state of Missouri and is located on the campus of the University of Missouri in Downtown Columbia, Missouri. The Society publishes the quarterly Missouri Historical Review, the only scholarly academic journal produced in the state. The Society engages in a number of outreach programs to bring Missouri's history to the public. Such programs are the Missouri History in Performance theatre, the Missouri History Speakers' Bureau, and the Missouri Conference on History. The collection of the Society, concerning pamphlets, books, and state publications, is over 460,000 items. In addition, the Society has over 500,000 manuscript items, 2,900 maps, over 150,000 state archival records, and over 57,000 reels of microfilm. In 2011, the Western Manuscript Collection, accessible in Columbia, Kansas City, Rolla, and St. Louis, Missouri, specializing in the preservation and collection of Missouri and Middle West history, was absorbed into the Society. History Established in 1898, discussion of founding an official state historical society had begun a few years earlier but did not gain substantial backing until the topic was raised at a January 1898, meeting of the Missouri Press Association.Alan R. Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri: 1898 - 1998, (Columbia, Missouri: U of Missouri Press, 1998), p. 19. Two of the chief supporters were Edwin W. Stephens, later first president of the Society, and Walter Williams, founder of the Missouri School of Journalism, and a third, Isidor Loeb, a member of the University of Missouri's history and political science faculty.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 19. At the January meeting, the proposal met with support of the members and a committee was established to draw up a constitution and bylaws for a historical society that would serve the state of Missouri.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 19-20. In this formative period of the Society's underpinnings, Stephens and Williams sought and received great support from the University of Missouri. Such was the support, that the not yet formed Society was given space in present-day Jesse Hall.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 20-21. Progress advanced quickly and only four months later, at the association's annual meeting on May 26, the Missouri Press Association voted to create the State Historical Society of Missouri, and named Stephens as its president, as well, Williams as its secretary.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 21.

Never intended to exist outside of the state's governance, the Society's leaders sought to see the formal adoption of the historical society by the state. In just under a year, their lobbying efforts were awarded by the passage of a bill by the Fortieth General Assembly, signed into law on May 4, 1899, by Governor Lon Stephens, which established the Society as a trustee of the state. However, the Society did not receive its first appropriation until 1901.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 22.

Secretary Loeb quickly sought to expand the collection further, putting out a request to citizens of the state for all types of items, both public and private, and including \\"Indian relics.\\"Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 26. The collection received a noted boost in 1901 by the donations of the new secretary, Francis Asbury Sampson, which consisted of nearly 2,000 books and just over 14,000 pamphlets.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 33. Additionally, he convinced the Sedalia Natural History Society to donate an equally considerable collection of books and pamphlets, as well maps and charts.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 32. In the same time period, the Society prepared an exhibit on the state's newspapers for the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair and began the first publications of the Missouri Historical Review.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 36-37. The growing collection necessitated the need for more space to store it. Slowly the society had expanded its presence in Jesse Hall, storing much of its collection in its basement, while taking over the first floor of the building.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 38. By 1902, the Society had begun looking for the resources for a new facility, going so far as attempting to lobby library philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 39. Just over a dozen years later in 1915, the Society moved into the newly built Ellis Library, its home ever since. Shoemaker years At approximately the same time, Floyd C. Shoemaker joined the Society and began a forty-five year career with the institution. In his time, Shoemaker accomplished a number of milestones under the Society. One such accomplishment was a campaign to establish the Society's membership as the largest in the nation, with the membership expanding from 1,285 in 1916 to 3,356 in 1936.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 55-56. While the Great Depression did not seriously affect the Society, it did become involved in several ways with the New Deal programs. For a couple years, it hired men from the National Youth Administration to assist in the moving books and newspapers. As well as hiring women from the Civil Works Administration to complete needed tasks about the Society such as updating the Society's \\"Who's Who\\" files for the state and indexing selected newspapers.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 68. The Society also assisted the Federal Writers' Project and the Works Progress Administration. Ellis Library, former entrance to the State Historical Society of Missouri. Joining Shoemaker at the Society in the same time period was George Mahan, who served as a trustee and as president. Mahan's contributions included a post-mortem donation to allow the Society to purchase books for the Society's Mark Twain collection, as well as the payment for the Society for the establishment of twenty-nine roadside historical markers along United States highway 36 from St. Joseph to Hannibal.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 71. The staff of the Society researched each marker and wrote their inscriptions.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 72. The Society would expand the historic marker program over the next decades, planting them across the state. Shoemaker also continued to expand the Society's collection, writing personal requests with some success. In 1932, Shoemaker cataloged donations for that year consisting of, \\"1,207 books, 964 pamphlets, 1 painting, 86 photographs and negatives, 28 manuscript collections, 3 ledger books, 1 medal, 49 clippings, 4 sheets of music, and 4 poems,\\" not including newspaper donations.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 86. Shoemaker pushed for more publications from the Society, which ranged from books to newspaper weeklies. From 1925 to 1939, the Society published a series of articles entitled, This Week in Missouri History, that appeared in at least one paper in 97 of the 114 counties across the state, including St. Louis.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 90. Begun in 1922, the Society embarked on a twenty volume project that concluded in 1965, entitled The Messages and Proclamations of the Governors of the State of Missouri. These volumes included biographical sketches, in addition to the documentation. Shoemaker proudly considered the Missouri Historical Review as one of the finest such publications in the country at the time.Havig,A Centennial History of the State Historical Society of Missouri, p. 91. Center for Missouri Studies On August 10, 2019, the 198th anniversary of Missouri's statehood, the Center for Missouri Studies opened in Columbia. The center is a large public facility built to replace Ellis Library as the headquarters of the State Historical Society of Missouri. It contains a vastly expanded gallery/collection display area, a library/reading room, classrooms, offices, open and closed stacks, microfilm rooms, art restoration lab, a large event room, and a gift shop. The Center for Missouri Studies is located on Elm Street on the University of Missouri campus in Downtown Columbia, across from Peace Park.

The Society houses a large collection of works by famed Missouri artists George Caleb Bingham and Thomas Hart Benton, in addition to other artists. Overall, the Society possesses over four thousand pieces of artwork, including paintings, lithographs, sketches, and engravings. The editorial cartoon collection includes works by Daniel Fitzpatrick, S. J. Ray, Don Hesse, Tom Engelhardt, and renown Second World War artist, Bill Mauldin.State Historical Society site on art collection. The Society also contains photography and map collections. The State Historical Society of Missouri hosts changing exhibits of art and history drawn from its collections. All exhibits and collections are open and fully accessible to the public. George Caleb Bingham collection A view of the George Caleb Bingham gallery at the Society with Order No. 11 in the background.One of the prominent artists of the Society's collection is George Caleb Bingham. Though born in Virginia, Bingham grew up and lived in Missouri. Famed for his depictions of everyday life on the rivers flowing through and along the state, as well for his portraiture, one of his most famous works is General Order No. 11. A crown jewel of the Society's collection, the painting depicts the forced removal of Missourians from western counties during the Civil War by the general order of Union general Thomas Ewing. The collection of Bingham's artwork owned by the Society represents one of the largest in the nation.Missouri State Historical Society site on art collection. Jon Luvelli Collection The Society has an established collection by international recognized street photographer Jon Luvelli. Luvelli's fine art photography has garnered worldwide recognition for his distinguished images of rural America townscapes. A native of Como, Italy, Luvelli was raised in a Mid-Missouri farm town. His work casts an aesthetic spotlight on contemporary life in the rural routes and small-town streets of the Show-Me State. Luvelli's work also conveys social messages, never shying away from the complicated subjects of racism, poverty, sexuality, abuse, and addiction. Daniel Fitzpatrick Collection Daniel R. Fitzpatrick is a two- time Pulitzer Prize-winning, editorial cartoonist for the St. Louis Post Dispatch has become one of the largest collections for the Society with over 1,500 original cartoon drawings. Social, political, and aesthetic attitudes shaped his artwork, with a special focus on the cartoons he created during the World War I era. Libraries The Society's Newspaper Library has the largest collection of Missouri state newspapers in the nation beginning with the very first newspaper published in 1808. Thousands of newspapers on microfilm are available to the public at the Society or via inter-library loan. The Society has at least one newspaper for each of Missouri's one hundred and fourteen counties. In 2008 the Society was chosen to participate in the National Digital Newspaper Program, a joint initiative sponsored by the Library of Congress and the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize historically significant newspapers. Select newspapers from the Society collection between the years 1880 and 1922 appear on the Chronicling America website. The Society also has a collection of digital newspapers available through its own website. The Society's Reference Library is home to over half a million volumes of published secondary sources on Missouri and the Middle West. Family histories, county histories, city directories, official state publications, church histories, scholarly journals, and genealogical indexes are among the many items that the public can consult. One of the Society's most notable collections is the J. Christian Bay Collection of Western Americana. Western Historical Manuscript Collection A joint collection held between the University of Missouri and the Society, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection (WHMC) is accessible at various locations throughout the state. Each of the four locations offer different historical material; the WHMC in Kansas City, specializes in the history and culture of Kansas City; the WHMC collection located at the Missouri University of Science and Technology features material concerning the Ozark highland and southern Missouri; and likewise, the WHMC office in St. Louis focuses on collecting material relating to the history of St. Louis and its surrounding region. The WHMC location in Columbia, Missouri, specializes on the history of the state from prior its establishment to the present, as well as, \\"the trans- Mississippi West: social and cultural, religious and educational, military and political, economic and legal, business and labor, urban and rural, ethnic, environmental, and many others.\\"Western Historical Manuscript Collection site on Columbia location. The Columbia collection consists in part of diaries, letters, photographs, and other material, of Missourians ranging from farmers, bankers, and frontier pioneers. In 2011, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection was absorbed into the State Historical Society and ceased to exist. The manuscripts and collection of the Western Historical Manuscript Collection can be accessed at the Society's Research Center located in Ellis Library and at Society research centers in Kansas City, St. Louis, Rolla, Cape Girardeau, and Springfield. Outreach In an effort to bring history to the public, the Society operates a number of programs. The Missouri History in Performance (MoHiP) is one such way. Through MoHiP, playwrights craft performances concerning moments in Missouri history, often which use the talents of folk musicians Cathy Barton and Dave Para. Often the playwrights draw upon 19th century plays, personal letters, and newspaper stories for reference.State Historical Society of Missouri site for MoHiP. Another avenue adopted by the Society to extend history to the public is the Missouri History Speakers' Bureau. For nearly forty years, the Society, through the Bureau, has made available lecturers to groups and organizations throughout the state to speak on various moments in the state's history. It is funded in part by the Missouri Humanities Council with assistance from the National Endowment for the Arts.State Historical Society of Missouri site for Speakers' Bureau. Annually, the Society holds the Missouri Conference on History, a multiple day event, in which lectures are given on Missouri related topics in history. In addition, awards are presented to the best book, best journal article, and best graduate student paper concerning state history. Publications In addition to the programs described above, the Society reaches the public through the means of publishing the Missouri Historical Review, a quarterly newsletter to members titled the Missouri Times, and books. The Missouri Historical Review, published since 1906, the Review publishes articles on Missouri history, as well as reviews of books concerning Missouri history. The review is award-winning and published every four months.State Historical Society of Missouri site on the Missouri Historical Review. In 2006, the Society published a number of collections celebrating 100 years of the Review on specific topics, such as the Civil War in Missouri and Kansas City: America's Crossroads. National History Day in Missouri Since 1989, The State Historical Society of Missouri also sponsors National History Day in Missouri, the state contest for National History Day. More than 2,400 students across the state participate in the contest, with more than 500 moving on to state. 50-55 students from Missouri move on to the national contest in Washington, D.C. based on performance in one of five categories: documentary, exhibit, paper, performance/acting, and website.National History Day. Contest Rule Book Revised 2008. College Park, MD, 2008. 6. Missouri Conference of History The Missouri Conference of History brings together history teachers and professional historians to share results of research, exchange information of teaching and curriculum, to consider ways to promote interest in history and the welfare of the profession and to discuss other concerns common to all historians. The conference takes please yearly at the University of Missouri- Kansas City.

Most Norwegian municipalities have a banner of their respective coats of arms as a flag. As Trondheim has no modern heraldic coat of arms, but a seal that is unsuitable as a banner of arms, a yellow \\"Trondheim rose\\" on a red field was instead chosen for the flag of Trondheim. The designer of the flag was professor Arne E. Holm, whose proposal was approved by the municipal council in 1989, and confirmed by royal order the same year. The four-petal dog rose is the official flower of the city and its stylised form is related to the Tudor rose. It is found as a symbol in medieval sources among other things representing St. Olav. This flower has been used as a symbol of the city at least since the 16th century. It is earliest preserved in the seal of the church chapter of Trondheim used in the 16th century. In the 17th century it was used on a green field in the banner of the citizen guard of the city. It has also been used as a symbol of several guilds such as the masons, bakers, goldsmiths and smiths. In the 18th century the flower replaced the three heads in the seal of Trondheim. The idea of the rose as a symbol of Trondheim may originally have come into being because of a misinterpretation of the last syllable of the city's old name Nidaros. The flower has been so closely connected to Trondheim that the Norwegian heraldic authority denied other municipalities the use of it in their coats of arms. The flag of Trondheim has been highlighted as an example of a good city flag design by Roman Mars in his radio show \\"99% invisible\\", a radio show focused on design and architecture.

Jones and Johnson generally go easy with, and even tolerate, numbers operators, madames, whores, and gamblers; but they are extremely hostile to violent criminals, drug dealers, confidence tricksters and pimps. Himes says that they are tough, \\"but they never came down hard on anybody that was in the right\\". One reviewer states: > Himes's two Harlem detectives are mythic heroes of sorts‚Äîindomitable forces > of nature, their status as heavy-handed enforcers for the Man elevated to > Harlem legends. So pervasive is the legend that their presence isn't needed > to inspire awe or fear, mention of their name is enough. They are the law, > the Man, the \\"mens\\", also a law onto themselves, using extralegal means to > induce compliance. The \\"extralegal means\\" frequently include physical brutality in the case of men suspected of violent crime, and psychological torture and intimidation with women who withhold information, such as when Grave Digger threatens to pistol-whip a woman \\"until no man will ever look at you again\\" (A Rage in Harlem), or strips another woman naked, tying her up, and making a hairline incision across her neck with a razor, then forcing her to look at the blood in a mirror. Himes attempts to portray this brutality in such a way that the reader does not wholly lose sympathy with the detectives. For example, in the throat-cutting incident, the woman was a key witness in a case where a young girl was being held hostage and threatened with death by a street gang, and Himes says of Grave Digger's actions: \\"He knew what he had done was unforgivable, but he couldn't stand any more lies\\". Jones and Johnson get away with these methods because they manage to solve high-profile cases under great pressure and because the victims of their brutality always either get killed off by other criminals, or are found to be implicated in serious crimes themselves. Notwithstanding the above, Grave Digger and Coffin Ed have deep and genuine sympathy for the innocent victims of crime. They frequently intervene to protect their black brothers and sisters from the random and truly pointless brutality of the white cops (as portrayed by Himes). Finally, the detectives seem sympathetic because they are under constant pressure to prove themselves, as the only black detectives in a precinct where the other cops are openly racist; and the flip side of their brutality is their willingness to put their own reputations and their own lives on the line whenever the interests of justice require it. There is abundant, and very effective, use of \\"black\\" (i.e., macabre) humor to lighten the mood of the stories, and they also contain many interesting sidelights touching on subjects as diverse as political corruption, jazz, soul food, and the sexual underside of Harlem life in that era. Three films have been made based on the characters of Coffin Ed and Grave Digger: Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), Come Back, Charleston Blue (1972) and A Rage in Harlem (1991).

It originated when King Christian I of Denmark had his County of Holstein- Rendsburg elevated to a duchy by Emperor Frederick III in 1474. Members of the Danish House of Oldenburg ruled Holstein ‚Äì jointly with the Duchy of Schleswig ‚Äì for its entire existence. From 1490 to 1523 and again from 1544 to 1773 the Duchy was partitioned between various Oldenburg branches, most notably the dukes of Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt (identical with the Kings of Denmark) and Holstein-Gottorp. The Duchy ceased to exist when the Kingdom of Prussia annexed it in 1866 after the Austro-Prussian War. History The northern border of Holstein along the Eider River had already formed the northern border of the Carolingian Empire, after Emperor Charlemagne upon the Saxon Wars reached an agreement with King Hemming of Denmark in 811. The lands of Schleswig beyond the river remained a fief of the Danish Crown, while Holstein became an integral part of East Francia, the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire. Establishment Adolf VIII, the last Count of Holstein- Rendsburg and Duke of Schleswig had died without heirs in 1459. As Schleswig had been a Danish fief, it had to fall back to King Christian I of Denmark, who, himself a nephew of Adolf, also sought to enter into possession of Holstein. He was backed by the local nobility, who supported the continued common administration of both lands and by the 1460 Treaty of Ribe proclaimed him as the new Count of Holstein. Nevertheless, the comital Holstein lands south of the Eider River officially remained a mediate fief held by the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg. In 1474 Emperor Frederick III conferred Imperial immediacy to Christian by elevating him to a Duke of Holstein. Partition In 1544, the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were partitioned in three parts between Christian's grandson Christian III of Denmark and his two younger half-brothers (who had to renounce the Danish throne), as follows: *The royal part, held by Christian III and his successors (identical with the Kings of Denmark). From 1648 the royal parts of Schleswig and Holstein were administered out of Gl√ºckstadt and became known as the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt. Before 1773 its Holstein territory consisted of the following √Ñmter: Rendsburg, South Dithmarschen, Steinburg, Segeberg, and Pl√∂n. *The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in Haderslev, held by Duke Hans the Elder. Hans had no issue and after his death in 1580, his territories were divided among his brothers. *The Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein in Gottorp, held by Duke Adolf and his successors. In addition, significant parts of Holstein were jointly administered by the Dukes of Holstein-Gl√ºckstadt and the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp, mainly on the Baltic Sea coast. In 1640, the County of Holstein-Pinneberg, whose ruling house was extinct, was merged in the royal part of the Duchy of Holstein. Reunification Allegorical depiction of Christian VII of Denmark uniting the royal and ducal parts of Holstein, painted by Nicolai Abildgaard In 1713, during the Great Northern War, the estates of the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp in Schleswig including Schloss Gottorf were conquered by royal Danish troops. In the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg, Duke Charles Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp ceded them to his liege lord the Danish crown. His remaining territories formed the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp, administered from Kiel. In 1773, Charles Frederick's grandson, Paul, Emperor of Russia finally gave his Holstein lands to the Danish king, in his function as Duke of Holstein, in exchange for the County of Oldenburg, and Holstein was reunited as a single state. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Duchy of Holstein gained sovereignty. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the Duchy of Holstein became a member of the German Confederation, resulting in several diplomatic and military conflicts about the so-called Schleswig-Holstein Question. Denmark defended its rule over Holstein in the First Schleswig War of 1848-51 against the Kingdom of Prussia. However, in the Second Schleswig War (1864) Prussian and Austrian troops conquered Schleswig. Christian IX of Denmark had to renounce both Schleswig and Holstein in the Treaty of Vienna (1864) on October 30. At first placed under joint rule in a condominium, Prussia and Austria then assumed administration of Schleswig and Holstein, respectively, under the Gastein Convention of August 14, 1865. However, tensions between the two powers culminated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Following the Peace of Prague (1866), the victorious Prussians annexed both Schleswig and Holstein by decree of December 24, 1866, and later established the unified Province of Schleswig-Holstein. List of statholders in Holstein The Danish king in his function as duke of Holstein, and duke of Schleswig, appointed statholders (German: Statthalter; Latin: produx) to represent him in the duchies.

The LIFE aims at representing and defending the interests of small and medium-sized businesses (which are under-represented in big-business dominated Confindustria, Italian employers' federation), and takes a libertarianhttp://www.lintraprendente.it/2013/12/i-forconi-che-ci-piacciono/ stance against big government, red tape, high taxation and monopolies. Its current leader is Lucio Chiavegato, who replaced Fabio Padovan in May 2013. The LIFE was founded in 1994 by a group of Venetist entrepreneurs (among them Fabio Padovan, Lucio Chiavegato and Diego Cancian) who were demanding fiscal federalism for Veneto, as an answer to what they called \\"the fiscal and bureaucratic oppression\\" by the Italian government, perceived as centralist and distant from the interests and the rights of the \\"Venetian people\\". In particular, they decided to organize themselves as a trade union, saying that they were the most oppressed workers in Italy. Since its foundation, the LIFE started to evolve to be a more broadly-based association and indeed in the last years it gained strength among entrepreneurs of Lombardy, Piedmont and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. During its history it cooperated both with regionalist movements all around Northern Italy and with the free-market libertarian Bonino List and, in general, with the Italian Radicals, maintaining even a radio program at Radio Radicale.http://www.radioradicale.it/argomenti- av/life?page=5 Some LIFE members had been involved in politics, especially with Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord. However many of them were soon disillusioned from it, which they perceived as too moderate and Lombardy-centred, and tried to form alternative Venetist parties. Examples include Fabio Padovan (member of the Chamber of Deputies for Lega Nord in 1992‚Äì1994, founder of Fronte Marco Polo in 2000 and founding member of Liga Fronte Veneto in 2001), Giorgio Panto (founder of North-East Project in 2004), Diego Cancian (regional councilor for North-East Project in 2005‚Äì2010) and Lucio Chiavegato (president of Veneto State in 2011‚Äì2012).

Etymology and origins The name comes from the Sanskrit words ‡§â‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡•ç‡§∞ U·π£·π≠ra, \\"camel\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§®, Asana meaning \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". A different (standing) pose is given the name Ushtrasana in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi. The modern pose is described in the 20th century by two of Krishnamacharya's pupils, Pattabhi Jois in his Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and B. K. S. Iyengar in his Light on Yoga. Description An International Day of Yoga class in Kolkata practising Ardha Ustrasana, Half Camel pose Ustrasana is a deep backward bend from a kneeling position; the completed pose has the hands on the heels. The backs of the feet may be flat on the floor, or the toes may be tucked under for a slightly less strong backbend. The pose is one of the 26 asanas in the Bikram Yoga sequence. Variations The name Ardha Ustrasana, Half Camel pose, is given to two different poses. One has the hands on the hips; the other has one hand on the heel on the same side, as in the full pose, and the other arm stretched back over the head. The pose can be modified by providing supports such as yoga bricks beside the calves for the hands. Claims Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as B. K. S. Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. Iyengar claimed that this pose would benefit \\"drooping shoulders and hunched backs\\".

The story was inspired by the novel A Journey to the Center of the Earth and was based on a Pertwillaby Papers adventure titled Vortex. It was also likely a partial sequel of the classic Carl Barks story, \\"Land Beneath the Ground!\\". Don Rosa wrote two sequels to this story, called \\"The Black Knight\\" and \\"The Black Knight Glorps Again\\". The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1995-13; the first American publication was serialized in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #604-606, in August-December 1996. Plot Gyro Gearloose has invented a \\"universal solvent\\", a thick, black liquid capable of instantly dissolving anything except diamonds, with it then transforming the dissolved matter into super high dense dust. Gyro then gives the Universal Solvent (referred to as \\"Omnisolve\\") kept in a diamond jar and an Omnisolve beach umbrella. Scrooge McDuck buys the solvent from him, intending on using it for mining, in order to gain the super pure diamonds located in the outer core of the Earth. However, when journalists at a press conference are unappreciative, an angered Scrooge decides to make an impromptu demonstration of the solvent. He carelessly pours it directly onto the ground, where it begins to make a solid shaft all the way down to the centre of the Earth (due to the Omnisolve creating a super-strong and dense lining on the sides of the shaft wall). After Donald's nephews explain the potentially catastrophic impact of this act - it would eventually lead to the Earth's destruction by destroying the planet's electromagnetic field and causing the Earth to be bombarded with radioactive solar winds - Scrooge, Donald, and the boys go on a quest down the shaft to retrieve the solvent. They first start slowly going down with an descent platform created by Gyro. In order to stop the air pressure from crushing them, Gyro creates an airlock over the shaft, making the shaft a vacuum, meaning they cannot eat, much to Donald's comical misery. Their platform is also slightly damaged by a falling pebble (which, due to the vacuum having no air to slow it down, was essentially travelling at bullet speed). Scrooge also finds his diamonds, although he is nearly burned by the massive heat of the diamonds, as they were in the outer core. Later, as Scrooge finds out, they become essentially weightless, due to their weight being their attraction to the Earth's mass, and as they travel deeper, more of the Earth is above them than below them, making them almost weightless. They also find out that they have reached a section of the shaft still with air, meaning that they can now eat, much to Donald's glee. Eventually, they reach the center and, after Scrooge is nearly killed by the Omnisolve, they are able to contain the Universal Solvent. However, the magma from inside the earth mantle will soon break through the shaft, making them have to use propulsion rockets to escape through inner space. Donald has his helmet destroyed by a falling pebble, but still survives, due to air leaking in from cracks. They soon find that the magma is destroying the shaft from the bottom up, and the top of the shaft is collapsing. They are able to escape aided by the Omnisolve umbrella, which saves them from the falling rocks and allows them to create an escape route, but unfortunately, the magma is able to follow them. They eventually find themselves in Terry Fermy, with the Terries and Ferrmies destroying a rock column, forcing them to use another escape route. They eventually find themselves under the Tulebug River, with the river water solidifying the magma. They then arrive at the Money Bin (given a lift by Gus Goose), with the top of the shaft about to erupt like a volcano. Gyro is able to stop the eruption with the Omnisolve umbrella, which causes the magma to be reduced into a super-dense dust that kept falling back on itself. Scrooge also gets the super-pure diamonds he wanted in the first place (due to them be carried by the magma, but the Omnisolve umbrella couldn't destroy them). Scrooge's Money Bin is also safe, although it's severely tilted, with Scrooge musing he could still have his workers work there by \\"wearing some special shoes\\". In the end, Scrooge deems the solvent as a failed investment. While it did succeed in getting him thousands of flawless diamonds from the bowels of the Earth, he didn't take into account that these diamonds are super-dense, and thus even the smallest ones weigh over 100 kg (200 pounds) each, making them useless as jewellery. He then destroys the Omnisolve notes with the Omnisolve itself, much to Gyro's relief.

Frequently referred to as TOPO, this compound is used as an extraction or stabilizing agent. It is an air-stable white solid at room temperature. Preparation and use TOPO is usually prepared by oxidation of trioctylphosphine, which in turn is produced by alkylation of phosphorus trichloride. The main use of TOPO is in solvent extraction of metals, especially uranium. The high lipophilicity and high polarity are properties key to this application. Its high polarity, which results from the dipolar phosphorus-oxygen bond, allows this compound to bind to metal ions. The octyl groups confer solubility in low polarity solvents such as kerosene.Watson, E. K.; Rickelton, W. A. \\"A review of the industrial and recent potential applications of trioctylphosphine oxide\\" Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange 1992, volume 10, pp. 879-89. In the research laboratory, both trioctylphosphine and TOPO are frequently useful as a capping ligand for the production of quantum dots such as those consisting of CdSe. In these cases, TOPO serves as solvent for the synthesis and solubilizes the growing nanoparticles. TOPO-coated quantum dots are typically soluble in chloroform, toluene, and (to a lesser extent) hexane. These quantum dots are also used in biological applications as part of the protective barrier to prevent degradation as it travels through the harsh climate of the body.

History  A first station at Kettwig was opened in 1871 by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn and passenger service on the line D√ºsseldorf-Kettwig-Kupferdreh was started on 1 February 1872. A proper station hall and ticket office was commissioned in 1873 and erected in 1875, the old station building was sold to Wermelskirchen. During 1873, another single-track railway line to M√ºlheim an der Ruhr was also built. The BME was integrated into the state railways of Prussia in 1882, and in 1887 a second track was built between Kettwig and Werden. In 1905, Kettwig was upgraded to a 1st class station, with express trains like the Essen to Basel service calling at the station. A passenger tunnel to access the second platform was also constructed. In 1926, after a construction time of over 13 years, a railway line to Velbert via Heiligenhaus was connected to the station, crossing the Ruhr on a third bridge. In March, 1945 the Ruhr bridges at Kettwig were destroyed by the German army. Services to M√ºlheim and Velbert were carried out from Kettwig Stausee railway station instead, and only a single bridge connecting the line to D√ºsseldorf was ever constructed after World War II. The Kettwig depot was closed in 1953 by the Deutsche Bundesbahn. In 1968, the railway line D√ºsseldorf-Kettwig-Essen was fully electrified, and on May 22, 1968 the first line of the Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn started calling at Kettwig. The S-Bahn line was renamed to S6 in 1974. Services at the station were substantially cut by November 1, 1977 when the station lost its autonomy due to the merger of Kettwig with the city of Essen. The ticket hall and station hall were closed, and the station was downgraded to a dependent outpost of Essen Hauptbahnhof. The former ticket hall building was sold to the city of Essen in 2001 and is now used as a cultural centre and restaurant. The station today sees regular service by Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn trains on the S6 line.

(1998). Test anxiety: The state of the art. New York, NY: Plenum It is a physiological condition in which people experience extreme stress, anxiety, and discomfort during and/or before taking a test. This anxiety creates significant barriers to learning and performance. Research suggests that high levels of emotional distress have a direct correlation to reduced academic performance and higher overall student drop-out rates. Test anxiety can have broader consequences, negatively affecting a student's social, emotional and behavioural development, as well as their feelings about themselves and school. Highly test-anxious students score about 12 percentile points below their low anxiety peers.Cassidy, J & Johnson. R. (2001). Cognitive Test Anxiety and Academic Performance. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 27, 270-295 Test anxiety is prevalent amongst the student populations of the world. It has been studied formally since the early 1950s beginning with researchers George Mandler and Seymour Sarason.The original research and development of the TAQ (Test Anxiety Questionnaire) was conducted by: Sarason's brother, Irwin G. Sarason, then contributed to early investigation of test anxiety, clarifying the relationship between the focused effects of test anxiety, other focused forms of anxiety, and generalized anxiety. Test anxiety can also be labeled as anticipatory anxiety, situational anxiety or evaluation anxiety. Some anxiety is normal and often helpful to stay mentally and physically alert. When one experiences too much anxiety, however, it can result in emotional or physical distress, difficulty concentrating, and emotional worry. Inferior performance arises not because of intellectual problems or poor academic preparation, but because testing situations create a sense of threat for those experiencing test anxiety; anxiety resulting from the sense of threat then disrupts attention and memory function.Sarason, I.G. Sarason, B.G. Pierce, G.R. (1995). Cognitive interference: At the intelligence‚Äìpersonality crossroads. In D.H. Saklofske & M. Zeidner, (Eds.) International handbook of personality and intelligence (pp. 285-296). New York: Plenum Press. Researchers suggest that between 25 and 40 percent of students experience test anxiety.Cassady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties (pp. 7-26). New York, NY: Peter Lang, Students with disabilities and students in gifted educations classes tend to experience high rates of test anxiety. Students who experience test anxiety tend to be easily distracted during a test, experience difficulty with comprehending relatively simple instructions, and have trouble organizing or recalling relevant information. Signs and symptoms A student of the University of Madras, with his hair tied to a nail in the wall, to prevent him from falling asleep (1905) Researchers believe that feelings of anxiety arise to prepare a person for threats.DePhil, M.B., Brilot, B., Nettle, D. (2011). Anxiety: An Evolutionary Approach. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 56(12):707-715 In humans, anxiety symptoms are distributed along a continuum and different symptom levels of anxiety predict outcomes. Responses consist of increased heart rate, stress hormone secretion, restlessness, vigilance, and fear of a potentially dangerous environment. Anxiety prepares the body physically, cognitively, and behaviourally to detect and deal with threats to survival. As a result, a person's body begins to hyperventilate to allow more oxygen to enter the bloodstream, divert blood to muscles, and sweat to cool the skin. In individuals, the degree to which an anxiety response is developed is based on the probability of bad things happening in the environment and the individual's ability to cope with them. In the case of test taking, this might be a failing exam grade that prevents the student from being accepted to a post-secondary institution. A person's beliefs about their own competencies are a form of self-knowledge, which plays an important role in analyzing situations that might be threatening. When a person has feelings of low competence about their abilities they are likely to anticipate negative outcomes such as failure, under uncertain conditions. Thus, evaluative situations including tests and exams, are perceived as more threatening by students who have low competencies. There is a difference between generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) and test anxiety. GAD is characterized by \\"trait anxiety\\" which results in a person experiencing high levels of stress across a wide range of situations. In contrast, people with test anxiety have a \\"state anxiety\\" which results in high levels of nervousness specific to testing.sady, J.C. (2010). Test anxiety: Contemporary theories and implications for learning. In J.C. Cassady (Ed.), Anxiety in schools: The causes, consequences, and solutions for academic anxieties (pp. 7-26). New York, NY: Peter Lang Symptoms of test anxiety can range from moderate to severe. \\"Students who exhibit moderate symptoms are still able to perform relatively well on exams. Other students with severe anxiety will often experience panic attacks.\\" Bad physical symptoms include: headache, upset stomach, feeling of fear, feeling of dread, shortness of breath, sweating, pacing or fidgeting, crying, racing thoughts and blanking out. During states of excitement or stress, the body releases adrenaline. Adrenaline is known to cause physical symptoms that accompany test anxiety, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and rapid breathing. In many cases having adrenaline is a good thing. It is helpful when dealing with stressful situations, ensuring alertness and preparation.Cohen S., Kozlovsky N., Matar M.A., Kaplan Z., Zohar J. and Cohen H. (2012). Post- exposure sleep deprivation facilitates correctly-timed interactions between glucocorticoid and adrenergic systems which attenuate traumatic stress responses. Neuropsychopharmacology 37; 2388‚Äì2404 But for some people the symptoms are difficult or impossible to handle, making it impossible to focus on tests. Test anxiety consists of: *Physiological overarousal ‚Äì often termed emotionality. Somatic signs include headaches, stomach aches, nausea, diarrhea, excessive sweating, shortness of breath, light-headedness or fainting, rapid heartbeat and dry mouth. Test anxiety can also lead to panic attacks, in which the student may have a sudden intense fear, difficulty breathing, and extreme discomfort. *Worry and dread ‚Äì maladaptive cognitions. This includes catastrophic expectations of gloom and doom, fear of failure, random thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, self-condemnation, negative self- talk, frustration and comparing oneself unfavorably to others. *Cognitive/Behavioral ‚Äì poor concentration, \\"going blank\\" or \\"freezing,\\" confusion, and poor organization. The inability to concentrate leads to impaired performance on tests. Fidgeting during or outright avoidance of the test. Students often report \\"blanking out\\" even though they have studied sufficiently for the test. *Emotional ‚Äì low self-esteem, depression, anger, and a feeling of hopelessness. Causes Research shows that parental pressure is associated with greater worry, test irrelevant thoughts, and stronger bodily symptoms relating to anxiety during a test. Other causes of test anxiety may include fear of failure, procrastination, and previous poor test performance. As well, characteristics of the test environment such as: nature of the task, difficulty, atmosphere, time constraints, examiner characteristics, mode of administration and physical setting can affect the level of anxiousness felt by the student. Researchers Putwain & Best (2011),Putwain D.W., Best, N. (2011). Fear appeals in the primary classroom: effects on test anxiety and test grade. Learning and Individual Differences, 21 580-584 examined test performance among elementary children when the teacher put pressure on the students in an attempt to create a more high stress environment. Their findings showed that students performed worse in high threat situations and experienced more test anxiety and worrisome thoughts than when in a low threat environment. Test anxiety is known to develop into a vicious cycle. After experiencing test anxiety on one test, the student may become so fearful of it happening again they become more anxious and upset than they would normally, or even than they experienced on the previous test. If the cycle continues without acknowledgement, or the student seeking help, the student may begin to feel helpless in the situation. People who experience test anxiety often have parents or siblings who have test anxiety or other types of anxiety. Anxiety does seem to have some genetic components. Diagnosis Test anxiety can be diagnosed using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, under the classification of social phobia. Social phobias are characterized by a marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which embarrassment may occur. In order to be diagnosed as suffering from a social phobia, the DSM-IV states that the individual must present four different factors. *Must show an immediate anxiety response when exposed to the feared social or performance situation. *Must show various attempts to avoid social or performance situation, or sometimes endure it but with extreme fear. *Must experience a disruption to normal activities due to the avoidance or fear associated with the situation *Must have experienced the symptoms for at least six months. Other variables related to test anxiety are: *Obsessive compulsive disorders *Perfectionist tendencies and unrealistic expectations *Negative self-esteem, self- statements, and criticism *Poor motivation or lack of confidence *Stereotype threat *Inadequate study and test-taking skills *Poor eating, sleeping and exercising habits Theories Anxiety is defined as the \\"psychological mechanism whereby the current intensification of a dangerous drive results in the elicitation of defenses.\\"Rosenwald, G.C (1961). The assessment of anxiety in psychological experimentation: a theoretical reformulation and test. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 62(3): 666-673 George Mandler and Seymour Sarason (1952), developed the theory that anxiety present in testing situations is an important determinant of test performance. Individuals that become highly anxious during tests typically perform more poorly on tests than low-test anxious persons, especially when tests are given under stressful evaluative conditions such as a post-secondary exam. The feelings of forgetfulness, or drawing a \\"blank\\" are developed because of anxiety-produced interference between relevant responses and irrelevant responses generated from the person's anxious state. The difference in performance of a high- anxious test taker compared to a low-anxious test taker is largely due to the difference in their ability to focus on the tasks required. A low-anxious test taker is able to focus greater attention on the tasks required of them while taking the test, while a high-anxious test taker is focused on their internal self, and the anxiety they are feeling. Anxious test takers do not perform adequately on the test as their attention is divided between themselves and the test. Therefore, students with high test anxiety are unable to focus their full attention on the test. Furthermore, anxiousness is evoked when a student believes that the evaluative situation, such as an assessment, exceeds his or her intellectual, motivational, and social capabilities.Putwain, D.W., Woods, K.A., Symes, W. (2010). Personal and situational predictors of test anxiety of students in post-compulsory education. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 80, 137-160 Psychologists Liebert and Morris (1967) analyzed the structure of test anxiety given on two distinct factors: Cognitive Test Anxiety and Emotionality. Emotionality means that the individual shows high levels of several different symptoms related to test anxiety that can be seen through physiological responses experienced during situations where they are being evaluated; such as an exam. Some of the physiological manifestations include: increased galvanic skin response and heart rate, dizziness, nausea, or feelings of panic. There is evidence that emotionality is a distinct part of test anxiety; however, it can be seen that when an individual displays high emotionality it means that it is mostly associated with declining performance, but only when the individual is also experiencing high levels of worry. The other factor mentioned is Cognitive Test Anxiety, also known as worry. It is mostly composed of the individuals cognitive reactions to situations where they are being evaluated, in the times prior to, during, and after those tasks. Some of the thoughts that individuals with high cognitive test anxiety are constantly dealing with are comparing self performance to peers, considering the consequences of failure, low levels of confidence in performance, excessive worry about grades, feeling that they are unprepared for tests, and loss of self-worth. Researchers Putwain, Woods & Symes (2010), found that a low academic self-concept was associated with higher worry and tension about their abilities to do well on a test. A student's metacognitive beliefs play an important role in the maintenance of negative self-beliefs. Anxiety reactions can be generalized from previous experiences to testing situations.Mandler, G. & Sarson, S. B. (1952). A study of anxiety and learning. Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 47, 166-173 Feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, anticipations of punishment or loss of status and esteem manifest anxiety responses. As well, the presence of an audience can debilitate the performance of high anxious test takers and increase the performance of low anxious test takers. Persons who score high on anxiety scales tend to describe themselves in negative, self-devaluing terms. Highly anxious test takers also blame themselves for their failure significantly more than low anxious test takers. The study of the relationship between anxiety and performance can be understood by using the Yerkes-Dodson Law, where one can see the facilitating and debilitating effects of arousal on performance as an inverted \\"U\\". An example of this correlation can be seen in terms of a child taking a test where the degree of arousal or anxiety that the child portrays can be seen as beneficial to the performance. Though, if the child doesn't have a feeling or fear or failure or some sort of encouragement to perform well on the test, then the child is unlikely to put the necessary effort into preparing or being motivated when taking the test and so he or she will not perform to their fullest potential. However, if before or during a test a child's level of anxiety is above the optimum level, they may also fail to demonstrate their true abilities. Under these circumstances fear of the actual test may disrupt preparation and cause a great amount of distress during the test that it is more than likely to impair their performance. Attentional theories There are two main groups of attentional theories that attempt to explain compromised performance in pressured situations. One group of theories are the explicit monitoring theories. They state that when a person is expected to perform a specific skill, the pressure may cause an increased self-consciousness and inward focus, which can disrupt their ability to successfully perform that task. Thinking about step-by-step procedures can inhibit one's ability to execute a task. For example, a study by R. Gray found that baseball players put into the high-pressure condition had increased errors, and an increased ability to recall details like the direction their bat was moving. This indicates that the pressured players were monitoring themselves more, which impacted their ability to successfully hit the ball. A second group of theories are the distraction theories. These theories states that high-pressure environments create a dual-task situation, in which the person's attention is divided between the task at hand and unhelpful thoughts about the situation and possible negative consequences of poor performance.On the interplay of emotion and cognitive control: Implications for enhancing academic achievement. Beilock, Sian L. Ramirez, Gerardo ; In: The psychology of learning and motivation (Vol 55): Cognition in education. Mestre, Jose P. (Ed.); Ross, Brian H. (Ed.); San Diego, CA, US: Elsevier Academic Press, Vol 55, 2011. pp. 140-141 Attention is an important part of working memory, which is the system that actively holds several pieces of relevant information in the mind while inhibiting irrelevant information. Working memory has a limited capacity, and the addition of stress and anxiety reduces the resources available to focus on relevant information.Revlin, Russell. Cognition: Theory and Practice. New York, NY: Worth, 2013. Print. In situations in which individuals need to concentrate their attention on a specific ta sk, emotional stimuli can divert their attention to a greater degree than non-emotional stimuli. Emotional stimuli will often dominate a person's thoughts, and any attempt to suppress them will require additional working memory resources. When working memory divides resources between the aversive cognitions and the task-relevant material, then the person's ability to use the relevant information on a test will suffer. People who suffer from test anxiety are more likely to experience negative cognitions while in evaluative situations. Furthermore, test anxious persons have been found to bias their attention towards threatening and anxiety related stimuli more than nonemotional stimuli. Research has accordingly found that tasks that rely heavily on working memory are the ones that suffer the most during pressure. Shortfalls in performance that are caused by test anxiety seem to be related to the extent to which the student has full access to their working memory. When comparing these two theories in the context of academic performance, a majority of work supports distraction theories. One reason for this is that many of the skills performed in the classroom require heavy demands on working memory. However, there are different kinds of pressure situations. There is monitoring pressure, in which an individual's performance is impacted due to the presence of an audience, and outcome pressure, in which an individual's performance is influenced by the consequences of the testing results. In a study, DeCaro et al. found that performance on a rule-based task, that relies heavily on working memory, was impaired by outcome pressure, but not monitoring pressure, whereas performance on an information-integration task, which does not require attentional control, was hurt by monitoring pressure, but not outcome pressure. These findings indicate that performance is compromised in different ways depending on the type of task, and the types of pressure, and that both theories can be correct. Attentional control Schematic of the four elements of Baddeley's model of working memory. Eysenck et al.Eysenck, M. W., Santos, R., Derekshan, N., & Calvo, M. G. (2007). Anxiety and cognitive performance: Attentional Control Theory. Emotion, 7(2), 336‚Äì352. elaborate upon the distraction theories and propose the attentional control theory. This theory uses Baddeley's model of working memory to explain the effects of anxiety on working memory and on performance. In Baddeley's theory, working memory (WM) consists of four components, one of them the central executive that has a number of tasks such as coordination of the temporary stores of phonological and visual information (phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad, respectively). The attentional control theory assumes that anxiety primarily affects attentional control, which is a key function of the central executive. Attentional control is the balance between the two attentional systems, the goal-directed system, influenced by the individual's goals, and the stimulus- driven system, influenced by salient stimuli. According to the attentional control theory, anxiety disrupts the balance between these two systems. The stimulus-driven system becomes stronger at the expense of the goal-directed system, thereby impairing the efficiency of the inhibition and shifting functions of the central executive. In support of this theory, there is strong evidence that anxiety largely impairs processing efficiency rather than performance effectiveness. Performance effectiveness refers to the quality of performance whereas processing efficiency refers to the amount of resources used to attain an effective performance. There is also evidence that anxiety impairs both the inhibition and the shifting function. Therefore, this theory suggests that students high in test anxiety will have to allocate more resources to the task at hand than non-test anxiety students in order to achieve the same results. In general, people with higher working memory capacity do better on academic tasks, but this changes when people are under acute pressure. Sian Beilock et al. found that pressure led individuals with a high working memory capacity to perform worse on a complicated task, whereas individuals with a low WM capacity got the same low results with or without pressure. This was because people with high WM could use more better but more demanding problem solving strategies in the low pressure condition, which they had to abandon in the high pressure condition. The low WM people never used these demanding strategies in the first place. Evidence for similar working memory effects in children has also been found. Evidence that trait anxiety might have different effects on working memory than state or acute pressure situations comes from Johnson et al. who found individuals' performances on a task showed a decrease in accuracy due to trait anxiety for individuals with low or average WM capacity, but did not significantly decrease for individuals with high WM. Measurement scales Early scales, by authors such as Charles Spielberger, tended to focus on physiological and somatic features and on worry, commonly referred to as emotionality,cf Charles Spielberger while more recent offerings, such as that by Cassady & Johnson, emphasize cognitive processes.Cassady, J. & Johnson, R. (2001). Cognitive test anxiety and academic performance. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 27, 270‚Äì295. \\"Test anxiety\\" for these authors consists of physiological and mental processes, and impaired test performance is seen as the result. The Children's Test Anxiety Questionnaire is specifically designed to measure test anxiety in children 8‚Äì12 years of age. It provides scores for three dimensions of test anxiety: \\"worrisome thoughts concerning failure (i.e. 'when I take tests, I worry about failing'), automatic reactions concerning students' general and specific somatic indications of anxiety (i.e. 'when I take tests, my heart beats fast'), and off-task behaviours concerning nervous habits and distracting behaviours (i.e. 'when I take tests, I play with my pencil')\\" The Test Anxiety Inventory for Children and Adolescent (TAICA) is a way to measure and assess test anxiety in children and adolescents in Grades 4 through 12. Those individuals who are being assessed rate their responses on a 5-point Likert- type scale ranging from 1 (never true about me) to 5 (always true about me). The TAICA is a 45-item self-report measure which consists of four sub scales. *Cognitive Obstruction/Inattention subscale assesses memory and attention difficulties and obstructed cognitions associated with test anxiety *Physiological Hyperarousal subscale measures physical symptoms associated with the test-taking process. *Social Humiliation subscale measures fear associated with failing a test and being belittled or ridiculed by significant others *Worry subscale assesses negative thoughts and worries that adversely affect test performance. Treatment  Medication is not recommended to treat test anxiety; instead, standard suggestions include sleep, proper nutrition, exercise, meditation, studying without stress, and enacting habits to reduce stress during the test. Management To gain an accurate assessment of student comprehension, instructors should be concerned with minimizing the effects of test anxiety. Instructors might offer \\"second chances\\" post test, familiarize students with test format and grading scheme, and lower the impact of any one test.Wilbert J. Mckeachie and Marilla Svinicki's \\"Teaching Tips\\" 12th edition, pg. 110; If students have greater confidence in their test- taking skills, they are more likely to be comfortable and relaxed when the testing does occur. Having an intentional thinking strategy should help student performance improve. For some individuals, poor academic performance is due to skill deficits, which could include problems in encoding (learning),rehearsal (study skills) or retrieval during a test (test-taking strategies).Damer, D.E., Melendres, L.T (2011). Tackling Test Anxiety: A groups for college students. The Journal for Specialists in Group Work, 36(3):163-177 Skill deficits may lead to poor performance directly (failure to adequately learn the material) or indirectly (awareness of being ill-prepared causes anxiety that, in turn, leads to poor performance). Therefore, the most effective interventions are those that combine skill-focused strategies (i.e. study skills training, test-taking skills) with cognitive (i.e. cognitive restructuring) or behavioural approaches (i.e. relaxation training, systematic desensitization).Ergene, T. (2003). Effective interventions on test anxiety reduction. School Psychology International, 24, 313‚Äì328 Students also need to stay healthy in order to be able to deal with stress and anxiety. They need to eat healthy, and get enough sleep.

Since mid-2008, episodes of Pic Me have begun to air in the United States on Animania HDhttp://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&only;=1&aid;=73&rid;=1534&tpl;=archnews&force;=1 and Sprout. Also, in the United States a Spanish-dubbed version airs on V-Me. Format Episodes of Pic Me last for approximately five to ten minutes. Pic Me is an innovative show in that it allows its viewers to star in each episode. Every episode has one viewer's photograph superimposed on a cartoon body. These characters then roam around the story, walking, running, jumping, and physically interacting with the main cartoon characters. The viewer characters never speak, and the other characters do not refer to them by name. Instead, they are referred to as \\"Little Boy\\" or \\"Little Girl\\" as is relevant. Since the start of 2007, many new episodes of Pic Me have involved two viewers, instead of just one. These \\"best friends\\" type episodes have the main star viewer holding, or looking at, a picture of their real-life \\"best friend\\". Another episode starring the \\"best friend\\" is shown at a later date, with the situation regarding the pictures reversed. Characters The main characters in Pic Me include:- *Juno ‚Äì a male lion with a nasal voice that sounds like he has a permanent cold. He is generally insecure and often seen to be frightened of confrontation. He is very forgetful, but loves having fun with his friends. *Gerty ‚Äì a female giraffe. She is quite intelligent and loves to cook, but is very fussy and likes things to be clean. *Banjo ‚Äì a male purple monkey *Umi ‚Äì a red, female parrot. She is clever and fun, but can have a brash attitude towards other characters, although not the \\"Little Boy\\" or \\"Little Girl\\". She is very talkative, but friendly. She enjoys carrying her friends into the air to \\"look at the sky\\". Presumably they enjoy this. *Clarence ‚Äì a male crocodile who has an inferiority complex. He is proud of his ability to swim, but otherwise can get very nervous around other characters. *Neville ‚Äì a blue, male elephant. He is the most intelligent character and is the character who gives everyone else good advice. They all ask him questions and - after screwing up his eyes - he will eventually give the right answer. He is a moral character and teaches the others right from wrong. The goal of the show is to help teach children. The viewers learn lessons from the differences between right and wrong (not telling lies etc.) to learning shapes, colours and counting.

It was used to connect the railway lines to M√ºlheim an der Ruhr, D√ºsseldorf and Velbert with each other. After a single Ruhr bridge was rebuilt, the station was renamed Kettwig Stausee in 1953. In 1960, services to Velbert and in 1968 services to M√ºlheim ended. The station building was torn down in 1981, and the station was downgraded to a mere S-Bahn stop.

It is owned by W.Y. Crichton & Co. History The paper was first published, as The Downpatrick Recorder, on 31 December 1835. It was the first newspaper published in Downpatrick and was owned by Conway Pilson. It cost 4d per issue or there was an annual subscription (in advance) of 18/- (18 shillings). Pilson was an astute businessman who found out that the English daily papers were delivered to Newry port on their way to Belfast and arranged for copies to be delivered to his Downpatrick printworks early where he copied the imperial news, thus getting the up-to-date news on the streets hours before the other papers were delivered to the town. In those days there was no such thing as copyright and papers shamelessly stole each other's copy. This strategy enabled the paper to grow from its initial print run of 875 impressions to over 5000 copies within a few months. Conway Pilson relinquished control of the paper in 1876 to Joseph S. Clarke, and died in 1883, aged 73. Clarke died in 1890. His widow married W.Y. Crichton in 1894 and their family continues to produce the paper to this day.

The plot involves two forty-year-old novelists, Gwyn Barry (successful) and Richard Tull (not so). Amis has asserted that both characters are based (if they can be regarded as based on anybody) on himself. It is, says Amis, a book about \\"literary enmity\\". Synopsis Gwyn Barry and Richard Tull have been friends since they roomed together at university. Richard Tull was a promising writer with a seemingly bright future. However his career flags and he finds himself depressed writing book reviews for a small literary paper and running a vanity press. To his chagrin, Gwyn Barry‚Äîwhose literary skills Tull holds in low esteem‚Äîhas written a phenomenally successful novel and won a lucrative and respected literary prize. Barry begins to enjoy a rarified life whilst Tull toils away with his unsuccessful pursuits. Tull, increasingly envious, begins to manufacture ways of bringing Barry down. These begin relatively innocently, attempts to cause Barry inconvenience. But later things become much more serious as Tull makes contact with violent men he later finds he cannot control. Themes Running through the book (indeed what \\"The Information\\" in question turns out to be) is the awareness of mortality and, relating to that, midlife crisis. In a later interview Amis elaborated on the subject of midlife crisis, describing it as \\"an hysterical overreaction to the certain knowledge that you're going to die.\\"Interview with Charlie Rose of \\"The Information\\" Furthermore, he illustrated it as intrinsic and structural, which corresponds to the etymology of the title: in \\"into\\" + formare \\"to form, shape\\".Online Etymology Dictionary Throughout the narrative Amis digresses into depicting different vistas of interstellar space. Looking on the vast range of the Universe and its lifelessness serves the theme of mortality. In addition the book deals with ideas of success, failure and envy. Reception The New York Times said, \\"Amis is quite dazzling here [...] drags a bit around the middle, but you're never out of reach of a sparkly phrase, stiletto metaphor or drop- dead insight into the human condition.\\" A further review from the same paper said \\"Amis has [an] idiosyncratic vision and his ability to articulate that vision in wonderfully edgy, street-smart prose [...] an uncompromising and highly ambitious novel that should also be a big popular hit.\\". In London The Independent gave a less favourable review saying, \\"The Information has been seen as the conclusion of a London trilogy that opened with Money and London Fields - but that argument doesn't stand up. They're all the same book, a template worked over three times, retyped rather than rewritten [...] The Information reads like 500 pages of smart, highly finished extracts. It doesn't add up. It's a Herbie Hide of a novel, a pumped cruiserweight, flashy, fast, brave and hopelessly overmatched.\\" Circumstances surrounding publication Amis came under attack for two reasons around the time The Information was published. Firstly he had dropped his agent, Pat Kavanagh, wife of Julian Barnes, and had signed up with Andrew Wylie, perceived to be a more aggressive agent. Amis and Barnes had been friends but this caused a rift that was played out in public. Secondly he received an almost unheard of advance for a literary novel (approximately ¬£500,000 according to most sources) which caused what was described as resentment and envy amongst his peers.

It was translated into nearly every language of the world, and was universally recognized as a veritable classic. Other poems followed, among them being \\"The Station Agent's Story,\\" \\"Red Cross,\\" and \\"In a Mining Town.\\" Although a busy and prolific author, she was ill for some years. In 1888, she and her family removed to San Diego, California, living in Rosemere, Pacific Beach. Early years and education Rose Alnora Hartwick was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, July 18, 1850. She was the daughter of William Morris and Mary Louisa (Wight) Hartwick. Her father's family were artists. In 1861, her parents removed to Hillsdale County, where she grew up, attended school, and began writing at an early age. She completed her education at the high school of Litchfield, Michigan, in 1868. Career Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight She began her literary career while still a school-girl in Litchfield by the publication of the ballad, \\"Curfew Must Not Ring To night\\" in the Detroit Commercial Advertiser, which immediately obtained enthusiastic recognition throughout the country. The prose sketch was based on a legendary incident of the time of Oliver Cromwell, in April 1867. It was her first publication. In 1871, she married Edmund Carson Thorpe, a writer of German dialect recitations. For a number of years, she contributed regularly to leading magazines and weeklies popular short stories and poems. Her best known shorter poems are \\"The Station Agent's Story\\" and \\"Remember the Alamo.\\" Others include \\"In a Mining Town\\" and \\"Red Cross\\". During 1881‚Äì82, she edited several publications for Fleming H. Revell, of Chicago. She was particularly successful with her stories for young people. Her published books are: Fred's Dark Days (1881); The Yule Log (1881); The Fenton Family (1884); Nina Bruce; or, A Girl's Influence (1886); Temperance Poems (1886); The Chester Girls (1887); Ringing Ballads (1887); The Year's Best Days (1888); and Sweet Song Stories (1898).

The series of entertaining stories for children, also included poetry and illustrations. In 1882, an illustrated edition of \\"Curfew Must Not Ring To-night\\" was issued. Nearly all of her books were profusely illustrated, including by her daughter, Mrs. Lulo Thorpe Barnes. In 1904, Thorpe wrote about the White Lady Cave in San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park in California. Visitors inside the cave could see the outline of a lady in the rock formations and local legend claimed a bride was trapped in the cave before her death. In The White Lady of La Jolla, Thorpe described: \\"She is robed in shimmering garments of light, wrapped in a misty veil, and on her head is a wreath like a coronet of orange blossoms.\\"Olten, Carol, Heather Kuhn, and the La Jolla Historical Society.

Personal life A biographical sketch of Thorpe published in The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review in 1889 noted that Thorpe had been hindered for a few years by ill health, but was recovering after her relocation to California. She died in San Diego, July 19, 1939. Awards and legacy In 1883, Hillsdale Coliege (Michigan) conferred on Mrs. Thorpe the honorary degree of A.M., because, as Pres. Durgin wrote; \\"You have written a poem that will never permit the name of its author to die while the English language is spoken.\\" Litchfield adopted the title of the poem as a symbol, having fire trucks and city website show the symbol of a bell reading \\"Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight.\\" A bell in the center of Litchfield commemorates the poem and Thorpe's time spent in the town.

He is noted especially for his watercolours. Biography Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. Hendrik Johannes Weissenbruch, also known as Jan Hendrik, was born in The Hague on 19 June 1824, the second son of Johannes Weissenbruch and Johanna Hendrika Zaag. He came from an artistic family. His father Johannes, a chef and restaurateur, painted in his free time and collected art on a small scale. Among Johannes' collection were works by Andreas Schelfhout and Bartholomeus van Hove. Johannes' cousin Jan (1822‚Äì80) was a well-known painter of townscapes. Another cousin Frederik Hendrik (1828‚Äì87) was a lithographer, while his younger brother Frederik Johan, his uncle Daniel and his nephew Isaac (1826-1912) were all engravers.de Leeuw et al p. 275 When Jan was sixteen years old he received drawing lessons from Johannes Low. In 1843, he took evening classes taught by Bartholomeus van Hove at the Hague Academy of Art. During the day Weissenbruch worked in Van Hove's studio, together with Johannes Bosboom and Salomon Verveer, helping to make pieces of scenery for the Royal Theatre. Weissenbruch's early work showed the strong influence of the romantic painter Andreas Schelfhout. Schelfhout's influence can be seen in Weissenbruch's early landscapes, painted in precise detail. His magnificent, cloudy skies show his admiration for the seventeenth-century artist Jacob van Ruisdael, whose work he saw at an early age in the Mauritshuis in The Hague. When he was invited to take lessons from this very celebrated artist, his older friend, Bosboom, advised him not to accept. 'I can't simply say \\"no, thank you\\" to Schelfhout!\\" sputtered Weissenbruch. Whereupon Bosboom said: \\"you should do that, Weiss! You have to learn to stand on your own and see through your own eyes.\\"de Leeuw et al pp. 44-5 In 1847, Weissenbruch first exhibited at the exhibition of Living Masters, and he became one of the founders of the Pulchri Studio. Jan Weissenbruch (1895): Strandgezicht Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam In 1849, two years after Weissenbruch staged his first exhibition, the Teylers Museum in Haarlem acquired one of his panoramic landscapes. However, that early success did not last very long. In spite of the prestige he had earned among his colleagues, he did not achieve public acknowledgement until the late 1880s. During this intermediate period, Weissenbruch went from being a characteristic painter of Dutch Romanticism to one of the best representatives of the Hague School. His lively dune landscapes led to a series of atmospheric impressions of the Dutch polders, in which the artist paid special attention to his representation of the cloudy skies with its light and shadows and the dynamics of the permante winds. The contrast from the sky to the water is very important to him, too. Thus he belonged to the Kortenhoef School, one of the followers of the Oosterbeek School. These beautiful oil and watercolour landscapes were painted, almost without exception, with free and delicate brushstrokes. The sky above the polders began to play a more important role. His use of color gradually became more restrained and his application of paint increasingly broader and looser. This made his landscapes more atmospheric, the bearers of light and clouds. He stressed the importance of both of these elements when he said, \\"The sky in a painting, that is what is most important! Sky and light are the great magicians. The sky determines what the painting is. Painters can never pay too much attention to the sky. We live from light and sunshine, and go with or palette through the dry periods.\\" Weissenbruch enjoyed working outdoors in the countryside. He usually found his subjects in the area around The Hague where he lived, rarely going far from home. However, in 1900, at the age of seventy, he took a trip to Barbizon where he painted his famous forest scene. The journey to Barbizon must have been a kind of pilgrimage for him, since it was in this area that French painters, in around 1830, had first begun to paint in the open air on a large scale. These 'painters of Barbizon' strove for a natural representation of the landscape, paying particular attention to the mood and the light. Nature for Weissenbruch was also of the utmost importance.

Blommers was also active as a teacher; among his pupils was the American painter Caroline van Hook Bean, who became his daughter-in-law in 1913.

Liberman was an American psychologist. His ideas set the agenda for fifty years of psychological research in speech perception.[* http://www.yatedo.com/p/Alvin+Liberman/famous/ae457edbc17cfd9f90150a216a4312d7] Biography Liberman received his B.A. degree from the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missourihttp://muarchives.missouri.edu/c-rg6-s40.html in 1938, his M.A. degree from the University of Missouri in 1939https://web.archive.org/web/20070108175035/http://www.mindspring.com/~ssshp/ssshp_cd/ss_hask.htm and his Ph.D. in psychology from Yale University in 1942. His ideas set the agenda for fifty years of research in the psychology of speech perception and laid the groundwork for modern computer speech synthesis and the understanding of critical issues in cognitive science. He took a biological perspective on language and his 'nativist' approach was often controversial as well as influential. He was a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut and of linguistics at Yale University as well as president of Haskins Laboratories from 1975 through 1986. Liberman had a distinctive goal in mind. In order to reach this goal, he developed a project where he was to produce the sound output of a reading machine for the blind, a device that could scan, print, and produce a selective acoustic pattern for every component of the English alphabet. His paper on the \\"Perception of the Speech Code\\" in 1967 remains one of the most cited papers in the psychological literature. He is also known for his pioneering work with Dr. Franklin S. Cooper on the development of the reading machine for the blind in 1944. He is also known for the development of the motor theory of speech perception with Ignatius Mattingly in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with his wife, Isabelle Liberman, he elucidated the \\"alphabetic principle\\" and its relationship to phonemic awareness and phonological awareness in reading. He was a member of the National Academies of Science and of many other distinguished scientific societies. After retiringÔºåAl remained an active, influential presence in the international scientific community. His publication record, which began in 1944 with an article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology, ended in 2000 with an article, coauthored with Douglas Whalen of Haskins LaboratoriesÔºåin Trends in Cognitive Sciences.Carol A. Fowler American Psychologist (December 2001), 56 (12), pg. 1164-1165 Liberman continued giving well-received speeches and presentations and continued to act as a catalyst for research at various institutes such as the Brain Research Laboratory at the University of Technology in Finland. He received an award from the Finnish Academy of Sciences, the last of his many accolades. On January 13, 2000, Alvin Liberman died due to problems that occurred after heart surgery. His son Mark Liberman is Trustee Professor of Phonetics and director of the Institute for Research and Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania. His son M. Charles Liberman is Professor of Otology and Laryngology at Harvard Medical School. His daughter, Sarah Ash, is an Associate Professor of Nutrition in the Department of Food, Bioprocessing, and Nutrition Sciences at North Carolina State University; as well as nine grandchildren that follow his lineage. Research Liberman was one of the first to conduct research and experimental studies in the field of speech development and linguistics. Through his research he aimed to gain a thorough understanding of the importance and purpose of speech in the act of reading and the process of learning to read. Some of his profound investigations were made during his time at Haskins Laboratories where he worked as a research scientist trying to investigate the relationships between speech and acoustics. From his research he came up with the idea that we hear spoken words much differently than sounds.Lindblom, A. (n.d.). Alvin m. liberman. Retrieved from http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/amlbl.html It was evident to Liberman that speech, the speed at which someone says something in particular, is connected to the word's amount of syllables, or in other terms its \\"acoustic complexity\\" (Whalen, 2000).Whalen, D. H. & Liberman, A. M., \\"Brain and Language\\" vol. 78, p. 372 The difference in the difficulty of speech and reading exists even as alphabetic writing systems provide discrete and invariant signals and nods to vowels, sounds and consonants. When it comes to speech and conversation, it \\"does not come to us as a series of individual words; we must extract the words from a stream of speech.\\" Carlson N. & Heth C., \\"Psychology: The Science of Behaviour\\" p.297, Retrieved April 8, 2012. Liberman and his colleagues were training the blind to read using a reading machine that would replace each letter of the alphabet with a specific sound. However, he and his colleagues found that the replacement of the sounds for each distinct letter of the alphabet did not help with the blind to learn to read or pronounce the letters fluently. After long investigations of why this was, Liberman established that speech was not as simple as an acoustic alphabet. Therefore, speech signals are very distinct from acoustic alphabet (Fowler, 2001). These investigations showed that speech perception is different from perception of other acoustic signals, and convinced Liberman that speech perception is the result of the human biological adaptations to language. Human listeners are able to decode the repetitive variable signal of running speech and to translate it into phonemic components. This is also known as the \\"motor theory of speech perception\\". Liberman ascribed this to the human biological disposition towards speech as opposed to reading which is not ingrained genetically. In one of his articles, Liberman mentioned speech production is easy to create as it relies on the \\"conscious awareness of phonological structure\\". He disagreed with \\"horizontal theory\\" because it would imply that the \\"advantage of ease\\" would be dependent upon reading and writing, not speech. Liberman also argued that reading alphabets is not important to speech until one learns the phonological pattern of speech. He made mention that speech itself is not only attributed to biological evolution, rather it is also species specific. Liberman also examined why reading is more difficult than speech perception. He attributed this greater difficulty to the human biological adaptation to speech. Liberman discovered that children who fail to learn to read on schedule lack phonemic awareness. Phonemic awareness is an awareness that word forms breaks down into individual parts. This is because they cannot appreciate the alphabetic principle. Bibliography  Carol A. Fowler, C.A. (2001).

Prior to this he was a columnist for The Observer. He was Chair of the Mental Health Act Commission from 1987 to 1994 and a Judge in the Court of Appeal of Jersey and of Guernsey from 1988 to 1996. He has chaired more than a dozen inquiries over the last decade including the Guns for Antigua scandal, and the Jasmine Beckford and Ashworth Inquiries. He sat as a Deputy High Court Judge on housing and judicial review cases until 1996. Blom-Cooper is well known for his regulatory work, particularly as Chair of the Press Council now the Press Complaints Commission and later as the founding chair of the premium rate telephony regulator, ICSTIS, later PhonepayPlus and now the Phone-paid Services Authority. In 1992 he was appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as the first Independent Commissioner for the Holding Centres. He held this appointment until April 1999. He was recently called to the Bar of Northern Ireland and granted Silk in Northern Ireland. He was also counsel to the Saville Inquiry acting for the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. The A6 murder, Regina v.

Hunter & Callaghan v Duckworth & Company and Blom-Cooper The 1997 book The Birmingham Six and Other Cases considered recent miscarriages of justice. It prompted an unsuccessful libel action in the Irish courts from Gerry Hunter and Hugh Callaghan. Initially Blom-Cooper argued that the publication of the book in Ireland was outside of his control. When this failed, he relied on European Convention on Human Rights#Article 10‚Äîright to freedom of expression and the newly formulated defence of Qualified privilege‚Äîprovided good practice was followed it was acceptable to get things wrong. Previously inaccuracy would have led to financial penalty. Despite this, solicitor Gareth Peirce accused Blom-Cooper of \\"shoddy research\\" and \\"total nonsense\\" in respect of the book.The Guardian profile: Gareth Peirce The Guardian Guardian Unlimited Campaigner Blom-Cooper was involved in the foundation of Amnesty International in 1961, supporting Peter Benenson's idea for an appeal for amnesty for political prisoners. It was at Blom-Cooper's suggestion that Benenson wrote to David Astor, proprietor of the Observer to publicise the campaign. Blom-Cooper also took part in a small committee of individuals who helped carry through the appeal which led to Amnesty International. He was also a Patron of Prisoners Abroad a registered charity which supports Britons who are held overseas, and was a trustee of the Howard League for Penal Reform.

Although many denigrate De Bock's work as too gray and too sketchy, Hague School champions love his work. Even Van Gogh was convinced of De Bocks \\"artistic temperament\\", although he eventually found his choice of subject too limited and tried to get De Bock to paint figure studies. But De Bock stuck to the subject he was good at, the Dutch landscapes. Biography A town on the river Vecht Born in The Hague, De Bock started out as a clerk for the Dutch Railway Company, but then turned to painting full-time, when the work interfered with his drawing. He trained in The Hague under the landscape painters J.W. van Borselen, J.H. Weissenbruch and Jacob Maris. He also spent time with Willem Maris and probably was one of his students as well. In 1880, De Bock traveled to Paris and Barbizon where he would often return, perhaps because of his appreciation for the work of Millet and Corot. It was especially Corot and Jacob Maris who would influence De Bock greatly. In 1881 he contributed to the Panorama Mesdag of Hendrik Willem Mesdag, where he painted the sky and dunes. He enticed Van Gogh to come and see the final work, and Van Gogh wrote enthusiastically about it in his letters to his brother Theo. Around 1880, he worked a great deal in Scheveningen and in the area of Loosduinen, and from 1884, he also visited other areas. In the autumn of 1885, he went to Drente for the first time, and when he returned there the following summer, he took Isaac Isra√´ls with him. His landscapes are often heavy and gloomy, and his oil sketches of the megaliths were often monumental. He wrote, \\"My idea of life is to reproduce and interpret all that I see and feel to be beautiful around me.\\" Although he hardly ever drew figures, his interest in the farmers was apparent from the number of short stories he wrote about farm life in Drente. As an alternative to Pulchri Studio, the Hague Art Circle was founded 1891 on the initiative of De Bock. Its goal was to promote the various artistic expressions such as the visual arts, crafts, architecture, music, musical arts and writing. De Bock became chairman of Visual Art and of the board. Although many painters were members of both organizations, the Art Circle offered the generation after 1850 an alternative to the Pulchri Studio, in which the renowned Hague School artists such as Mesdag, Isra√´ls, and Jacob Maris were members. An exhibition organized in 1892 by Jan Toorop, which included works by Vincent van Gogh, was a major success and the avant-garde reputation of the Art Circle was established.

Biography Nelson was born in Chloride, Arizona to William Henry and Georgia P. Nelson. Her sister, Pauline D. Nelson, was a year older. Nelson's brief film career began with a 1920 comedy short called Springtime. The actress played the role of the daughter to The Commissioner, who was portrayed by Oliver Hardy. Her screen credits number only fifteen. Nelson was last seen in the western Desert Rider (1923) in the role of \\"Carolyn Grey.\\" In 1923 the actress was found dead in a gas-filled room by her mother, Mrs. Georgia P. Nelson. The two women resided at 6281 De Longpre Avenue in Los Angeles, California. The body was found after the mother returned from a visit to her son-in-law Charles L. King. The star of Hollywood comedies had not been seen for days and it was presumed she had been dead for some time. Nelson left two notes in her room which were found by police. One stated she intended to end her life because she was tired. The other said \\"I am just about gone and will soon be with my friend Wally.\\" Wallace Reid was a popular actor of that era who died after a struggle with narcotics dependency, just a few months before Evelyn. She was 23 years old. A police investigation into her death evidently did not contradict the apparent suicide.

He is the father of Dutch entomologist Herman Willem van der Weele (1879‚Äì1910). Van der Weele lived and worked initially in Middelburg, where he was a special inspector of the sea and harbor works in Zeeland. When he was 20 he moved to The Hague and was a student of the Art Academy in The Hague. He received advice from Anton Mauve and Johannes Bosboom. Mauve's influence can be detected in van der Weele's paintings. His compositions have the same simplicity and his choices of subjects are very much like those of Mauve. He painted flocks of sheep, sheep barns, stable interiors, meadows with cows, sand drifts, foresters with horses, farmers plowing with an ox team, milkmaids tending cows, street scenes with coaches, and sand quarries. Van der Weele occasionally worked in Limburg and Drente, but he usually spent his summers around Nunspeet in the Veluwe. Van der Weele was a close friend of George Hendrik Breitner, who dedicated his 'Self-portrait With Lorgnette' to van der Weele.

It is located c. 30 km north of Valencia, close to the Costa del Azahar on the Mediterranean Sea. It is best known for the remains of the ancient Iberian and Roman city of Saguntum, which played a significant part in the Second Punic War between the Carthaginians and the Romans.  History  Achaeans, probably from the Greek island of Zakynthos, founded in the 5th c. BCE the town Zacynthos (now Zakantha or Sagundo), at the foot of the Pe√±as de Pajarito and on the west bank of river Palancia of the main river Ebro, in Iberia, in the Valencia province [Appian, Wars in Spain, 2], where the vestiges of an Acropolis, Temples of Artemis and Aphrodite, and a small Theater still survive. During the 5th century BC, the Iberians built a walled settlement on the hill overseeing the plain; a stretch of cyclopean limestone slabs from the former temple of Diana survives, close to the modern church of Santa Maria, but the settlement site is still older. The city traded with coastal colonies in the western Mediterranean such as Carthage and, under their influence, minted its own coins. During this period, the city was known as Arse (Ripoll√®s i Alegre 2002). By 219 BC, Saguntum was a large and commercially prosperous town, which sided with the local colonists and Rome against Carthage, and drew Hannibal's first assault, his siege of Saguntum, which triggered the Second Punic War, one of the most important wars of antiquity. After stiff resistance over the course of eight months, related by the Roman historian LivyLivy: History of Rome and in more detail by Silius Italicus,Silius Italicus: Punica Saguntum was captured in 219 BC by the armies of Hannibal. Seven years later, the town was retaken by the Romans. In 214 BC, it became a municipium, was rebuilt and flourished. Hispania was not easily pacified and Romanised, as the Iberian career of Quintus Sertorius makes clear. Saguntum minted coins under his protection, but continued to house a mint in later Roman times. The Romans built a great circus in the lower part of the city and a theatre seating 8,000 spectators. Texts found indicate that the city had an amphitheatre and had about 50,000 inhabitants. This prosperity lasted for most of the empire, and is attested by inscriptions and ruins (notably a theatre, demolished by Napoleon's marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet, who also destroyed the Roman tower of Hercules). Saguntum Forum Saguntum Theatre Saguntum rear wall of ancient theatre Under the Arian Visigothic kings, Saguntum received its Catholic patron saint, a bishop named Sacerdos, \\"the priest\\", who died peacefully of natural causes about AD 560. In the early 8th century, the Muslim Arabs conquered Hispania and the city became part of the Caliphate of Cordoba and at that time the city reached an era of splendor, with baths, palaces, mosques and schools open for its cosmopolitan population. Then, the town was known as Morvedre (Morviedro in Spanish), a name derived from Latin muri veteres \\"ancient walls.\\" However, as Valencia grew, Saguntum declined. In 1098, the city was conquered by El Cid but the Muslims recovered it shortly thereafter. The city had been under the Muslim Arab rule for over 500 years when James I of Aragon conquered it in 1238. During the Peninsular War, a Spanish attempt to raise the French siege of the castle failed in the Battle of Saguntum on 25 October 1811. In the weeks before the battle, the Spanish garrison made a valiant and successful defense; but it surrendered the day after the battle. Historian Charles Oman stated that the site was converted into a fortress in 1810‚Äì1811 by General Joaqu√≠n Blake at the suggestion of British officer Charles William Doyle. At that time, much of the largely intact Roman theater was dismantled to provide stone for restoring the old walls. Saguntum was badly damaged in warfare, but has retained many Valencian Gothic structures. In the late 19th century, a steel-making industry grew up that supported the modern city, which extends in the coastal plain below the citadel hill. The last steel oven closed in April 1984. It has been restored and is now a tourist attraction. Main sights * The remains of Sagunto Castle may be seen on top of the hill.

Plot Eleven-year-old George (Barret Oliver) is left alone with his ancient and infirm grandmother, while his mother leaves to visit George's brother in the hospital. George's mother is concerned that George might be frightened of his Gramma, but George insists that he is not. After she leaves, George spends the time completing his schoolwork and attending to his household chores. A heavy storm brews outside, and George hears a monstrous growl from the bedroom. It is his grandmother asking George for her tea. George is startled and hides, but convinces himself he's too old to behave this way and resigns himself to bring the tea. As he walks down the hall to the Gramma's room, George recalls conversations in which his mother and her siblings discussed how dangerous Gramma is now that she is senile. As George enters Gramma's room, he considers how awful it would be if she died while he was alone with her. A gnarled hand reaches out from the bedclothes. This startles George, and he drops the tea tray and flees the room. Regaining his composure, George returns to clean up the broken mess. He opens a panel in the floor. A red, smoky light shines from the aperture, and he hears screams. Thinking that this is the entrance to Hell, George grabs his grandmother's books and runs out with them. When he reaches the kitchen, he examines the books. Much of the text is in a language he does not understand, but the illustrations suggest to him that they are books about witchcraft and summoning the dead. He assumes that his grandmother wrote the books and that she is a witch. George returns to his grandmother's room and tries without success to rouse her. Thinking she must be dead, he runs to the phone to call the hospital. He then imagines the things he must do if she is dead, like covering her face and explaining the circumstances to the doctor. He returns to her room, even though he doesn't want to do so, to make sure she is dead. A gnarled hand reaches out and grabs him. Gramma opens one glowing red eye and glares at him. She draws him to her and embraces him, and tells him that he is her favorite, and they seem to merge into one being. George's mother returns and finds George sitting at the kitchen table with his grandmother's books. He explains that Gramma died and he didn't know what to do. She tries to comfort him, but does not see that he now has glowing red eyes like Gramma. Note This episode is based on the short story of the same name by Stephen King, published in the collection Skeleton Crew (1985). The segment contains several references to the Cthulhu Mythos, including use of the names Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, and an appearance by the Necronomicon.

He was engaged in extortion and racketeering and was well known across the North of England. He was shot dead on 31 December 1993, but the murder remains unsolved to the present day. Life Graham was born in 1959 to Hazel (n√©e Leck) and Eric \\"Jack\\" Graham, and grew up in Highfield, Rowlands Gill, a village on the outskirts of Gatehead. After quitting his career as a successful amateur boxer, Graham became a doorman, eventually working with well-known Gateshead hardmen, Billy Robinson and Paddy Leonard. With his irrefutable abilities, (a talented 17 stone boxer, who could benchpress 520lbs),http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/viv-grahams-fiancee-issues- challenge-6458175 he was soon operating a small army of doormen himself, and he protected various licensed premises in central Newcastle, Byker, and Wallsend. Graham became a reputed organised crime figure in the city, and was involved in extortion and racketeering. In 1988, he was shot at during an incident that is believed to have been a revenge attack for an earlier unprovoked assault by Graham and a fellow bouncer, which left the victim with permanent injuries. Graham's activities brought him a very large income, (occasionally in excess of ¬£30,000 per week circa 1992), although a lot of his wealth was lost to his and his partner's profligate behaviour, and his penchant for gambling. Indeed, at the time of his death, his car was in danger of being repossessed. Away from the worlds of bars and nightclubs or 'enforcement' activities, Viv Graham would often frequent either bookmakers, (often placing single bets of over ¬£1,000), or Andy Webb's gym in Jesmond, Newcastle. He lived with girlfriend Anna Connelly in Walkerville, Newcastle upon Tyne with her children from a previous relationship. Although unmarried, they were engaged and he acted as stepfather to the children and they viewed him as their father. Connelly's brother, Peter, was a publican in the Byker area of the city, and he would often be approached by fellow publicans requiring the services of Graham. A well known 'hardman' with an intimidating presence, Graham became one of the most feared men in the North East of England, and earned a huge reputation for violence. This increased still further after Graham had annihilated several well-known Tyneside hardmen, (resulting in many more capitulating without any confrontation), and following an incident in which he severely assaulted rival doorman Stuart Watson, who also had a substantial reputation. During 1989, Graham was working with a gang who had been refused access to a club by then-head doorman, Stuart Watson. Watson believed that the gang would show no respect to other revellers, and would treat the place as if they owned it. Furthermore, he obviously wanted to preserve his own position at the club. (Years later Watson said of the incident, \\"I was just doing what I had to do to keep trouble out of the club. As a doorman, your job is to prevent any bad characters getting in.\\") Unable to intimidate the not inconsiderable Watson, members of the gang subsequently returned to the club, accompanied by Viv Graham and some of his associates. It is said that Graham had been deliberately misinformed about Watson's activities, and that he was wrongly told that Watson had made threats against him. The fracas that ensued, took place at, (the now demolished) Hobo's nightclub in Newcastle, and was later revealed to have been recorded on CCTV.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFVvgPIN7OI Graham can be seen delivering multiple debilitating punches to Watson, and throwing the 28-year-old, 17-stone doorman around the reception area of the nightclub. This incident resulted in Graham's conviction and an inevitable prison sentence, in spite of his victim refusing to give evidence against him. Whilst serving his prison term, Graham took a keen interest in the case of Stephen Craven, who by then was serving a sentence for murdering Penny Laing at Newcastle's Studio nightclub on 24 December 1989. Graham attempted to assist Craven, who protests his innocence to this day. (The BBC program Rough Justice covered the murder conviction in 'Murder at the Studio', which was first broadcast 1 April 1997). Although Craven's conviction remains in place. Upon Graham's release, he broke all ties with his former gangland associates, and a prolonged, bitter dispute ensued. He also attempted to mend fences with the aforementioned Watson. Graham was soon back in court for an assault in which he is said to have, (quote), \\".....punched a man senseless\\". Around this time, various adversaries began working against Graham. He had confronted a gang member in a Newcastle nightclub about supplying drugs in one of 'his' establishments, and following a scuffle, the man escaped via the fire exit with Graham in hot pursuit. Unsolicited confrontations were set up, (one with a notorious, well known, now deceased fighter he avoided), and he survived several attempts on his life. Graham's apparent dislike of drugs antagonised the gangs that had a vested interest. They wanted to expand their 'drugs enterprises', but Graham's anti- drugs stance was in the way. Graham was aware of their plans to remove many of his men from the doors of the pubs and clubs of Newcastle. He was receiving death threats almost daily, and shortly before his death, a car drove past Graham's home and one of the passengers shot out the windows of his house. On Christmas Eve 1993, Graham was involved in another confrontation with a gang in Newcastle. An attempt was made to remove Graham's firm from an establishment, but the attempt failed as Graham, being there in person, repeatedly punched one of the gang, breaking his jaw, whilst the other members beat a hasty retreat. Death On New Year's Eve 1993, Viv Graham was ambushed whilst returning to his car, (which he had parked in a side street), from Wallsend High Street. The offside, front window of his Ford Sierra Sapphire Cosworth had been broken, possibly to make him hesitate before entering the vehicle, or to activate the alarm so as Graham would return to the parked car. However, there is speculation as to whether this was done well before the shooting. He was shot three times by an unidentified gunman, (one shot leaving a large hole in his back), but managed to drag himself back to Wallsend High Street, where he was found by fellow bouncer, Terry Scott. In spite of him receiving thirty pints of blood, Viv Graham died at North Tyneside General Hospital four hours later, aged just 34. He is buried at Hookergate Cemetery.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/viv- grahams-son-attacked-gutless-1341286 He had received a telephone death threat just hours before he was shot. Viv Graham had often prophetically predicted that he, \\"wouldn't see 40\\". He had curtailed the activities of several narcotics based gangs by refusing them access to the pubs and clubs that employed him, and he was known to never carry a firearm. Investigation In 1995, Northumbria Police interviewed an informant who named the killer, and confessed to his role as the 'getaway driver'. In 2014, a police transcript was obtained by Newcastle's Evening Chronicle newspaper, that outlined a police visit to a so-called 'supergrass', whilst he was serving a prison sentence. During the visit, the informant watched a video, and showed detectives a safe-house, (a bungalow in Heaton), used by the hitman in the immediate aftermath of Graham's death. He then detailed his own involvement in the notorious murder, and named the gunman who murdered Graham. It is documented that he claimed to be in possession of a tape recording of the gunman admitting to the shooting, but he did not hand it over to the officers. He claimed to have stolen a Ford Escort from Birtley, before travelling to Heaton. On 31 December 1993, he picked up the gunman who said, \\"he was going to shoot Graham in the legs in retaliation for some ongoing dispute\\". They went to Graham's house, but his car wasn't there, so they drove around Wallsend, and soon discovered Graham's car parked just off Wallsend High Street. The stolen car was then parked with a view of the back of Graham's car. The gunman got out, walked over to Graham's car, and smashed the driver's door window. When Graham returned to his vehicle, three shots were fired at him. The gunman ran back to the stolen Escort, got in, and the informant drove off. Once back in Heaton, the Escort was set alight, and the pair were picked up by associates. The informant stated that the gunman had used a 357 Magnum. He stated that he believed that the gunman was high on cocaine at the time of the shooting, and they both believed that Graham was only wounded, as he was last seen still alive, on all fours beside his car. In 1998, Northumbria Police questioned five men about an alleged conspiracy to murder the bouncer. In 2002, Tyneside career criminal Lee Shaun Watson turned supergrass, after he admitted the murder of Freddie Knights in Longbenton, Newcastle upon Tyne. During the 'Knights Murder Trial', the jury at Leeds Crown Court heard how Watson had told police who was responsible for the shooting of Graham. The court was also told that after he was arrested for a separate offence in 1994, Watson had boasted to police, \\"You couldn‚Äôt catch us for shooting Viv Graham.\\"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/viv-grahams-mam- speaks-heartache-1399983 Watson's account is widely disputed. Graham's family offered a ¬£100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killers. More than 1,000 people were interviewed over the murder, 500 homes were visited, and hundreds of statements were taken. In spite of these developments, no-one has ever been brought to justice, and the murder remains unsolved. Family On 25 March 2010, Graham's son Dean was found dead at the wheel of his car on the Whinfield Industrial Estate, near his home in Rowlands Gill. It is thought that he took his own life.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/funeral-date-fixed- viv-grahams-1413204 Graham's other son, Viv Jnr, was attacked by thugs in 2012, and left with a fractured skull.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/viv-grahams-son- attacked-gutless-1341286 Viv Jnr has on occasion, seemingly attempted to live up to his father's reputation. During an abortive attempt to reclaim funds allegedly owed to his cousin, young Graham assaulted the debtor's father, and, upon returning empty-handed to his cousin's home, headbutted and punched a woman who told him to calm down. Judge Penny Moreland imposed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/murdered-viv- grahams-son-carried-9619097 References Sources ;Books * External links *The Northern Echo: Five quizzed over killing Category:1959 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Murdered British mobsters Category:English mobsters Category:People murdered by British organized crime Category:English murder victims ","title":"Viv Graham"},{"id":"8146653","text":"Izhemsky District (; ) is an administrative district (raion), one of the twelve in the Komi Republic, Russia.Law #13-RZ It is located in the north of the republic.

In 1982, he won First Prize at the Shanghai Junior Instrumental Soloist Competition and a Silver Medal at the China National Junior Instrumental Soloist Contest.[1] His performance skill exempted him from high school exit exams, and he entered the Shanghai Conservatory of Music.[2] During his stay, he participated in a program to broadcast Chinese language radio from North America. He finished his Bachelor of Arts degree and graduated in 1988 with honours. He was the first student ever promoted one year early from that school.[3] After graduation, he was invited to the International Orchestra as a solo artist. He founded the pop bands Red Maple Leaf and Snowman in Beijing. In 1989, he was invited to North Korea to host the World Youth Festival and the Arts diploma.[4] In 1991, he was admitted into the Royal Conservatory of Music and began studying piano and vocals.[4] He also established the Inner Pulse pop band during that year. Two years later, he became the first erhu instructor at the school, established the first erhu syllabus, and organized the first large erhu concert in Canada.[4] In 2005, he was invited to play at the Governor-General's inauguration in Ottawa.[5] He tours the world frequently, performing in entertainment centres such as the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and China.

It was based on the 1958 novel Marianne Dreams by Catherine Storr. The film stars Ben Cross, Glenne Headly and Gemma Jones. The original novel was the basis of a six-episode British TV series for children in the early 1970s which was titled Escape Into Night. Plot While suffering from glandular fever, 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a house. When she falls asleep, she has disturbing dreams in which she finds herself inside the house she has drawn. After she draws a face at the window, in her next dream she finds Marc, a boy who suffers with muscular dystrophy, living in the house. She learns from her doctor that Marc is a real person. Anna sketches her father into the drawing so that he can help carry Marc away, but she inadvertently gives him an angry expression which she then crosses out, and the father (who has been away a lot and has a drinking problem, putting a strain on his marriage) appears in the dream as a furious, blinded ogre. Anna and Marc defeat the monster and shortly afterward Anna recovers, although the doctor reveals that Marc's condition is deteriorating. Anna's father returns home and both parents seem determined to get over their marital difficulties. The family goes on holiday by the sea, where Anna finds an epilogue to her dream.

The film stars Forest Whitaker, Danny Glover, Badja Djola, Robin Givens and Gregory Hines. Producer Stephen Woolley intended it to be a comedy film, and several reviewers have described it as such,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/03/movies/review-film- panning-for-gold-in-1950-s-harlem-via-himes- novel.htmlhttps://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1991/04/a-rage-in- harlem/https://ew.com/article/1991/05/17/rage-harlem/amp/ but this categorization has been disputed by director Bill Duke. The film premiered in competition at the 44th Cannes Film Festival in its Grand Palais, receiving a \\"five-minute standing ovation.\\" It was also shown at the 2nd Stockholm International Film Festival. Plot A black gangster's beautiful moll flees to Harlem with a trunk full of gold after a shootout, unaware that the rest of the gang, and a few other unsavory characters, are on her trail. Cast * Forest Whitaker as Jackson * Gregory Hines as Goldy * Robin Givens as Imabelle * Zakes Mokae as Big Kathy * Danny Glover as Easy Money * Badja Djola as Slim * John Toles-Bey as Jodie * Tyler Collins as Teena * Ron Taylor as Hank * Samm-Art Williams as Gus Parsons * Stack Pierce as Coffin Ed * Willard E. Pugh as Claude X * Helen Martin as Mrs. Canfield * Wendell Pierce as Louis * T. K. Carter as Smitty * Jalacy Hawkins as Screamin' Jay Hawkins * Beatrice Winde as Clerk * George Wallace as Gravedigger Jones Development William Horberg, eventually credited as an executive producer, got the project started when he optioned the rights to Himes' novel. Hornberg, a first-time producer approached John Toles-Bey, a Chicago-based actor with no screenwriting credits, to draft the film's first script; the development effort gained steam after Hornberg met Kerry Boyle of Palace Productions, and through the efforts of Boyle and Stephen Woolley, the film was sold to Miramax Films and given the green-light. According to publicity leading up to the start of principal photography, Forest Whitaker was the first of the two lead actors to commit to the film, described as an action-comedy with \\"very dark\\" comedy. Whitaker among others, was consulted as Boyle and Woolley sought an African American to direct the film, doing so because they believed \\"maintaining the cultural integrity of the novel demanded a black director\\"; they also wanted \\"someone who was older and secure enough to collaborate and make a picture that we could distribute widely, but who still had a passion for the material.\\" They chose Duke in part for his experience directing Hill Street Blues, experience that was key \\"because of the way that series mixed humor and violence.\\" Duke later cast Robin Givens to play the female lead after considering 300 women for the part. Production The film was shot in the Cincinnati, Ohio neighborhood of Over-the-Rhine, whose \\"un-gentrified area of the old downtown lower depths stood in quite nicely for ... 1950s Harlem.\\" About midway during production, it turned out that Duke and Woolley had undiscussed differences about the tone the film was going to take: > About halfway through we [Woolley and Duke] were looking at a scene, and I > turned to Bill [Duke] and said 'You know, that wasn't quite as funny as it > was in the script. And I don't know why. And he said to me, 'We're not > making no god-damn comedy.' I'd raised the entire money for this film on the > basis that it was a comedy. It was Chester Himes, it was supposed to be > funny. And a shiver went down my spine...I hoped that Bill was joking. But I > realized he thought we were making Porgy and Bess. Reception The film currently holds a 65% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. Vincent Canby, reviewing the film for The New York Times, called it \\"painless, occasionally funny\\" but with a \\"heedlessly incomprehensible plot\\"; according to Canby, \\"Because the screenplay is so thin, the characters are revealed entirely by the actors who play them. Miss Givens does particularly well as a doxy with a heart of gold as well as a trunk full of it. She looks great and shows a real flair for absurd comedy. Mr. Hines, Mr. Whitaker and Mr. Glover also are in good form, as are Badja Djola, who plays Imabelle's intimidatingly large former lover, the guy she's stolen the gold from, and Mr. Toles-Bey, who, in addition to working on the screenplay, appears as one of the bad guys.\\" According to Box Office Mojo, the film grossed about $10.4 million in the United States.

Since April 1999, the Orchestra has had its headquarters at L'Auditori. Prior to that, from its foundation to 1998, the orchestra was resident at the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana. History In addition to the Orquestra Simf√≤nica del Gran Teatre del Liceu, founded in 1847 and devoted to opera and ballet, Barcelona has had several symphonic orchestras since 1888. From 1910 to 1924, a private-based Orquestra Simf√≤nica de Barcelona gave its concerts in the Teatre Eldorado, led by Joan Lamote de Grignon. After it, the city's principal orchestra was the Orquestra Pau Casals (1920‚Äì1936), conducted by Pablo Casals, and linked to the Associaci√≥ Obrera de Concerts (Workers' Society for Concerts). After the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), both the orchestra and society were banned and Casals was exiled to France. In 1944, a new Barcelona civic orchestra ‚Äì the current Orquestra Simf√≤nica de Barcelona ‚Äì was founded with the name of Barcelona Municipal Orchestra, created by the City Hall and promoted by the Catalan conductor and composer Eduard Toldr√†. Toldr√†, through his leadership, helped to consolidate the orchestra's presence very early in the cultural life of the city. Barcelona has since had a regular cycle of symphonic concerts with the collaboration of the main national and foreign performers and with the aim to make classical music reach the greater public and especially to spread the work of Catalan composers. After Toldr√†'s death in 1962, Rafael Ferrer became the head of the orchestra until 1967, when Antoni Ros-Marb√† succeeded him. From this moment, it received the name of Orquestra Ciutat de Barcelona (City of Barcelona Orchestra, or OCB) until the constitution of the Consortium made up of the Government of Catalonia and Barcelona City Hall, in the 1994‚Äì95 season, which gave it the current name of Orquestra Simf√≤nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya (Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra), known as OBC. In 1994‚Äì1995 season a Consortium made up of the Government of Catalonia and Barcelona City Hall was constituted. The current music director of the OBC is Kazushi Ono as of September 2015, with an initial contract of three years. The current principal guest conductor of the OBC is Emmanuel Krivine, as of 2013, with a contract through the 2015-2016 season. The OBC has made recordings for such labels as Decca, EMI, Auvidis, Koch, Claves and Naxos Records.

While it is highly effective in early disease this decreases in those who have long-term infection. It is the first-line treatment given its moderate side effects compared to nifurtimox. It is taken by mouth. Side effects are fairly common. They include rash, numbness, fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping. Rare side effects include bone marrow suppression which can lead to low blood cell levels. It is not recommended during pregnancy or in people with severe liver or kidney disease. Benznidazole is in the nitroimidazole family of medication and works by the production of free radicals. Benznidazole came into medical use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. As of 2012, Laborat√≥rio Farmac√™utico do Estado de Pernambuco, a government run pharmaceutical company in Brazil was the only producer. Medical uses Benznidazole has a significant activity during the acute phase of Chagas disease, with a success rate of up to 80%. Its curative capabilities during the chronic phase are, however, limited. Some studies have found parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of T. cruzi from the body) in children during the early stage of the chronic phase, but overall failure rate in chronically infected individuals is typically above 80%. Some studies indicate treatment with benznidazole during the chronic phase, even if incapable of producing parasitologic cure because it reduces electrocardiographic changes and delays worsening of the clinical condition of the patient. Benznidazole has proven to be effective in the treatment of reactivated T. cruzi infections caused by immunosuppression, such as in people with AIDS or in those under immunosuppressive therapy related to organ transplants.  Children  Benznidazole can be used in children, with the same 5‚Äì7 mg/kg per day weight- based dosing regimen that is used to treat adult infections. A formulation for children up to two years of age is available. It was added to the WHO Essential Medicines List for Children in 2013.WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for Children 4th list (April 2013) https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/93143/EMLc_4_eng.pdf;jsessionid=E14AB3B91001367EBF107EB43C039A0C?sequence=1 retrieved 13 February 2020 Children are found to be at a lower risk of adverse events compared to adults, possibly due to increased hepatic clearance of the drug. The most prevalent adverse effects in children were found to be gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic in nature. However, the incidence of severe dermatologic and neurologic adverse events is lower in the pediatric population compared to adults. It use for Chagas in children was approved by the FDA in the US in 2017.  Pregnant women  Studies in animals have shown that benznidazole can cross the placenta. Due to its potential for teratogenicity, use of benznidazole in pregnancy is not recommended. Side effects Reaction to benznidazole Side effects tend to be common and occur more frequently with increased age. The most common adverse reactions associated with benznidazole are allergic dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. It is reported that up to 30% of people will experience dermatitis when starting treatment. Benznidazole may cause photosensitization of the skin, resulting in rashes. Rashes usually appear within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolve over time. In rare instances, skin hypersensitivity can result in exfoliative skin eruptions, edema, and fever. Peripheral neuropathy may occur later on in the treatment course and is dose dependent. It is not permanent, but takes time to resolve. Other adverse reactions include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and dysguesia, and bone marrow suppression. Gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur during the initial stages of treatment and resolves over time. Bone marrow suppression has been linked to the cumulative dose exposure.  Contraindications  Benznidazole should not be used in people with severe liver and/or kidney disease. Pregnant women should not use benznidazole because it can cross the placenta and cause teratogenicity.  Pharmacology   Mechanism of action  Benznidazole is a nitroimidazole antiparasitic with good activity against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, commonly referred to as Chagas disease. Like other nitroimidazoles, benznidazole's main mechanism of action is to generate radical species which can damage the parasite's DNA or cellular machinery. The mechanism by which nitroimidazoles do this seems to depend on whether or not oxygen is present. This is particularly relevant in the case of Trypanosoma species, which are considered facultative anaerobes. Under anaerobic conditions, the nitro group of nitroimidazoles is believed to be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex to create a reactive nitro radical species. The nitro radical can then either engage in other redox reactions directly or spontaneously give rise to a nitrite ion and imidazole radical instead. The initial reduction takes place because nitroimidazoles are better electron acceptors for ferredoxin than the natural substrates. In mammals, the principal mediators of electron transport are NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH, which have a more positive reduction potential and so will not reduce nitroimidazoles to the radical form. This limits the spectrum of activity of nitroimidazoles so that host cells and DNA are not also damaged. This mechanism has been well-established for 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole, but it is unclear if the same mechanism can be expanded to 2-nitroimidazoles (including benznidazole). In the presence of oxygen, by contrast, any radical nitro compounds produced will be rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen, yielding the original nitroimidazole compound and a superoxide anion in a process known as \\"futile cycling\\". In these cases, the generation of superoxide is believed to give rise to other reactive oxygen species. The degree of toxicity or mutagenicity produced by these oxygen radicals depends on cells' ability to detoxify superoxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species. In mammals, these radicals can be converted safely to hydrogen peroxide, meaning benznidazole has very limited direct toxicity to human cells. In Trypanosoma species, however, there is a reduced capacity to detoxify these radicals, which results in damage to the parasite's cellular machinery.  Pharmacokinetics  Oral benznidazole has a bioavailability of 92%, with a peak concentration time of 3‚Äì4 hours after administration. 5% of the parent drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, which implies that clearance of benznidazole is mainly through metabolism by the liver. Its elimination half-life is 10.5-13.6 hours.  Interactions  Benznidazole and other nitroimidazoles have been shown to decrease the rate of clearance of 5-fluorouracil (including 5-fluorouracil produced from its prodrugs capecitabine, doxifluridine, and tegafur).Product Information: Teysuno oral capsules, tegafur gimeracil oteracil oral capsules.

History The Makeshift Miracle Initially titled The Makeshift Miracle, the story was originally serialized online three pages per week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as a webcomic from September 10, 2001 until its conclusion on March 4, 2003. In February 2002, The Makeshift Miracle became one of the launch titles part of the web comics umbrella known as Modern Tales and stayed as a part of the MT archive structure until it finished its run. In July 2003, The Makeshift Miracle was offered for 99 cents as a complete digital graphic novel through Bitpass. It was the second comic content offered for sale through Bitpass, the first being Scott McCloud's story, The Right Number. In November 2006, The Makeshift Miracle was released in print as a 200 page graphic novel published by UDON Entertainment, making it the first wholly creator-owned content published by the Toronto based comic company. The published version of Makeshift Miracle has been remastered for print, with crisper line art and higher quality lettering than its original 72 dpi web comic version. Makeshift Miracle On September 26, 2011, in cooperation with UDON Entertainment, Zubkavich relaunched the title in an expanded and revised format as Makeshift Miracle, featuring new art drawn by Shun Hong Chan. Serialized online like its original incarnation, Makeshift Miracle was updated twice a week, every Monday and Friday. The relaunched title ended its run on July 9, 2014. Since the title's inception, UDON Entertainment has collected the first six chapters of Makeshift Miracle into a graphic novel titled The Girl From Nowhere, published on June 5, 2012. Plot Colby Reynolds is a disillusioned youth who‚Äôs got a lot on his mind. His views on the world are changing and the negative aspects of his awkward teenage years are staring him full in the face. His parents go away on a vacation, leaving him with more time alone than he‚Äôs ever had before. Feeling a bit adventurous, he wanders around the city, seeing it for the first time really by himself. Feeling compelled on some strange level, he ventures to the outskirts of the city and relaxes under the stars, absorbing the stillness of the moment. That is, until something crashes from the night sky, nearly killing him. The source of the crash is a girl named Iris, who seems to have no memory of her past or recollection of how she got there. Stranger still, she seems to have brought quite a bit of trouble to Colby‚Äôs life, as he finds himself drifting aimlessly through strange daydreams and discovering a tree growing in his living room. After a harsh argument with Iris over her inability to explain any of the weird events, Colby finds a passageway to ‚Äúsomewhere else‚Äù and decides to confront whatever comes next head on by climbing in. Colby‚Äôs nosey friend Blake comes by the house to say hello and finds a lot more than he bargained for. An oddly clad man named Esurio is at the house, looking for Colby, with Iris nowhere to be found. Esurio seems to have found something interesting while investigating the field where Iris crashed, and he's looking for answers from our protagonist. Once Esurio realizes that Colby's out of sight, he focuses his efforts on Blake and offers to help Blake‚Äôs childhood dreams be fulfilled. Dreams that he's buried out of fear, regret and bitterness. Scared or desperate, Blake decides to play Esurio‚Äôs bluff on the small chance that he may be telling the truth. After all, being a powerful King is better than being a scared teenager in a big world. Colby found a new landscape that isn‚Äôt in any atlas. According to an old man he's met there named Veridicus, this land is a \\"snare for the dreams that people have in their youth\\". Dreamworld or not, Colby has crossed over in body and soul, making it just as dangerous as anywhere \\"real\\". Similarities to Other Works Zub openly admits that Neil Gaiman is an influence and many of the elements, such as the mask and dream themes, can be seen in Gaiman's The Sandman series. Main characters Colby Reynolds Colby is a young teenage boy on the cusp of maturity learning to deal with his thoughts and feelings. Mostly introverted, he doesn't seem to relate well to the other students at his high school. Blake Matthews Blake is one of Colby's only friends at school. He's become a bit of a fixture, seemingly gravitating towards Colby as someone to pal around with. Iris Iris is a mysterious young girl who (quite literally) comes crashing into Colby's life out the blue. She has no memories of who she is or where she's come from. Esurio A mysterious goggled man from the dream realm who knows the secret that binds Colby and Iris together.

The pair spent over a year conning the camp's commandant. Eventually they persuaded their Turkish captors they were insane and, after being moved to a hospital for the mentally ill in the summer of 1918, the two men played their roles as lunatics so successfully they also fooled the doctors and were returned home. Ironically, they arrived home only a few months before their brother officers were released from Yozgad.

The manga was published in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday magazine from July 1997 to June 2006, and compiled into 43 tank≈çbon volumes. The story centers on Masaru Saiga, a young boy who inherits a massive fortune and aspires to become a puppeteer, Narumi Kat≈ç, a kung-fu expert who suffers from Zonapha syndrome (a strange illness that stops his breathing unless he makes people laugh), and Shirogane Saiga, a silver-haired woman and Masaru's caretaker who controls the puppet Harlequin. They must fight against the battling automatons (auto-mannequins) and save the world from the Zonapha syndrome. Karakuri Circus has been adapted into an anime television series by Studio VOLN. It aired from October 2018 to June 2019. In addition to the anime series, it was adapted into two stage plays in 2012 and two more in 2019, and a mobile game was launched in 2019. As of 2018, the manga had over 15 million copies in print. Synopsis Background The events are tied to a cycle of reincarnation that began 200 years ago when two brothers, Bai Yin and Bai Jin, traveled from China to Prague in order to study alchemy and improve their puppetry skills. The brothers encountered a beautiful woman by the name of Francine and they both fell in love with her. The younger brother, Jin, was devastated when his elder brother Yin proposed to Francine and she agreed to marry him. Fueled by hatred and despair, Jin abducted her. After 9 years of searching, Yin arrived in Quiberon, France, only to discover that Francine had fallen ill and had been imprisoned by fearful villagers. In the hopes of curing and freeing her, Yin then worked to create the Aqua Vitae, an elixir of life that could impart incredible healing powers and a greatly increased lifespan. However when he finally completed it, he found that Francine's prison had been set ablaze and she died moments before he could give it to her. Another 23 years passed and the younger brother Jin had created an Automaton in her image and injected it with Aqua Vitae in hopes of bringing it to life. He was greatly disappointed when he realised that in stark contrast to the original Francine, she would not laugh or smile no matter what he did. He then created automaton clowns to make her laugh, but they failed, so he released the Zonapha (Z.O.N.A.P.H.A.) syndrome into Kuroga village, forcing them to make her laugh or suffer a living death. The Zonapha syndrome is where the body is dominated by the parasympathetic nerves, the trachea contracts, causing breathing difficulties and excruciating pain is felt in every nerve. The symptoms continue unabated until the victim can make someone laugh. Lucille Berneuil was one of the villagers who suffered at the antics of the murderous clowns. Six years later, Yin returned and sacrificed himself to activate the Aqua Vitae with his blood and save the villagers. When Lucille drank the water, she acquired Yin's memories and knowledge along with his puppet Harlequin, and she vowed to crush Jin's automata. Years later, Sh≈çji Saiga learned swordsmanship at Miura Dojo in Nagasaki while also studying to be a doctor under Dr. Bai Yin. Together they completed a marionette which Sh≈çji named a Shirogane. While treating a sick Mr. Nakayama, Sh≈çji encountered a healing woman who called herself Tohno-dayu, although her real name was Angelina. She held the \\"Soft Stone\\" within her body which could produce Aqua Vitia. By accident, she revealed that she had Bai Yin's marionette, Arlequin, which she used to help Sh≈çji escape from a burning building. Later, Sh≈çji tracked down Angelina, where she told him about her past and the vial of Aqua Vitae which was given to her. Sh≈çji had fallen in love with her and he drank the liquid, vowing to spend eternity with her. Sh≈çji and Angelina began to create their own marionettes. They later adopted the shirogane, Dean Maistre as their son, naming him Sadayoshi. Sh≈çji also encountered the Francine automaton who Jin abandoned because she could not laugh. Sh≈çji adjusted her to make her less powerful, although she wanted to be dismantled because she felt that she was missing a vital gear. Some time later, Angelina became pregnant and gave birth to the baby girl, √âl√©onore. The family were attacked by automata searching for the Soft Stone, however the Soft Stone was now inside √âl√©onore and Angelina entrusted the baby to Francine. Francine fell into a well with √âl√©onore who automatically turned the water into Aqua Vitae which destroyed Francine although she saved √âl√©onore. Angelina was mortally wounded by the automata and Sh≈çji decided to keep √âl√©onore's existence a secret so he sent her to the Quiberon orphanage to be raised by Lucille. 37 years later, Sh≈çji visited the orphanage and found that √âl√©onore remembered him because of the memories of Francine transferred to her via the Aqua Vitae. Sh≈çji then learned that Sadayoshi has had a son called Masaru whom Sh≈çji raised as his grandson. However Sadayoshi's plan was to leave his fortune to Masaru as bait to cause the destruction of the Kuroga clan. Sadayoshi is the reincarnation of Bai Jin, who transferred his memories into a young Bai boy using his hair and Aqua Vitae and then called himself Dean Maistre who was later adopted by Sh≈çji Saiga. He planned to transfer his memories into Masaru and essentially become immortal, but Sh≈çji destroyed the memory data back at Karuizawa and asked Lucille to send √âl√©onore to protect Masaru and find the soft stone. Plot The plot centers around three main characters, , , and and combines the settings of a circus, alchemy, and karakuri puppets. The story starts when Masaru Saiga's father dies and leaves 18 billion yen of inheritance solely to him. His uncle and half-siblings each plot to kill or abduct Masaru to seize the money. By coincidence, the Zonapha sufferer Narumi Kat≈ç rescues Masaru from his uncle's henchmen with help from the Shirogane √âl√©onore. As the story progresses, a 200-year-old tragedy is uncovered involving the origin of the Shirogane, Automatons, and the Zonapha syndrome. The people of the Shirogane group and the Nakamachi Circus group must work together to save the world and prevent its destruction from the Zonapha syndrome. After the third volume of the manga, the story splits into two separate but related arcs. In the first arc, Narumi Kat≈ç joins the Shirogane to battle the automatons (auto-mannequins) and save the world from the Zonapha syndrome. In the second arc, √âl√©onore and Masaru join the Nakamachi Circus and attempt to live a normal life as possible but their fates are still heavily linked to their pre-determined destiny. The events triggered by either Narumi or √âl√©onore's arcs are mentioned on each other's story, sometimes directly affecting one another. Eventually, during the climax of the story, the two paths intersect. Media Manga The manga began serialization in 1997, in the issue 32nd of Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday, released on July 23, 1997.

These prokaryotes are thermophilic sulphur-dependent organisms related to the genera Sulfolobus, Pyrodictium and Desulfurococcus. They are hydrogen-sulphur autotrophs and can grow at temperatures of up to 95 ¬∞C.  Description and significance  Thermoproteus is a genus of anaerobes that grow in the wild by autotrophic sulfur reduction. Like other hyperthermophiles, Thermoproteus represents a living example of some of Earth's earliest organisms, located at the base of the Archaea.  Genome structure  Genetic sequencing of Thermoproteus has revealed much about the organism's modes of metabolism. Total genome length is 1.84 Mbp, and the DNA is double-stranded and circular. Genes are arranged in co-transcribed clusters called operons. The Thermoproteus tenax genome has been completely sequenced.  Cell structure and metabolism  A significant amount of research has been done on the metabolism of Thermoproteus and other hyperthermophiles as well. Thermoproteus metabolizes autotrophically through sulfur reduction, but it grows much faster by sulfur respiration in cultivation. In T. tenax, a number of metabolic pathways allow the cell to select a mode of metabolism depending on the energy requirements of the cell (depending, for example, on the cell's developmental or growth stage). Like all archaea, Thermoproteus possesses unique membrane lipids, which are ether-linked glycerol derivatives of 20 or 40 carbon branched lipids. The lipids' unsaturations are generally conjugated (as opposed to the unconjugation found in Bacteria and Eukaryota). In Thermosphaera, as in all members of the Crenarchaeota, the membranes are predominated by the 40-carbon lipids that span the entire membrane. This causes the membrane to be composed of monolayers with polar groups at each end. The cells are rod-shaped with diameters of up to 4 micrometres and up to 100 micrometres in length, and reproduce by developing branches on the end of the cell which grow into individual cells. They are motile by flagella.  Ecology  Members of Thermoproteus are found in acidic hot springs and water holes; they have been isolated in these habitats in Iceland, Italy, North America, New Zealand, the Azores, and Indonesia. Their optimal growth temperature is 85 ¬∞C.See the NCBI webpage on Thermoproteus.

It is notable as it not only provides electricity from the combustion of waste but also supplies heat to a local district heating scheme, making it one of the most advanced, energy efficient incineration plants in the UK. In 2004, the district heating network prevented 15,108 tonnes of CO2 from being released from buildings across the city, compared to energy derived from fossil fuels. The incinerator is a 'static asset' owned by Sheffield City Council and operated by Veolia Environmental Services under a 35 year integrated waste management contract (IWMC)/PFI contract. The process Waste from households, Local Authority services and some local businesses is brought to the EfW Plant. It is tipped into a waste storage bunker. From the bunker the waste is lifted into a feed hopper by an overhead crane at a rate of 28 tonnes per hour. The hopper feeds the waste into a single incineration unit where it is burned in excess of 850 ¬∞C. A large boiler located above the incineration unit is heated to produce superheated steam at 400 ¬∞C. A condensing steam turbine uses this steam to generate electricity for the National Grid and produce hot water for the District Energy network. Urea is introduced into the furnace to treat NOx (Oxides of Nitrogen) emissions. Lime and activated carbon is introduced to neutralise the acidity of the flue gas and adsorb other pollutants. The cooled flue gases pass through a filter house where the particulate (dust) is captured by 1760 filters and stored in a silo for separate disposal later. Cleaned gases are then released through the chimney. These gases are continuously monitored to ensure they meet strict environmental regulations. An electromagnetic overband separator removes metal from the ash. The metal is delivered to a local company for recycling. Ash from the incineration process goes into a bunker before being taken to a process plant for treatment and recycled into aggregate for the construction industry. Controversies In 2001 ownership of the original incinerator was transferred to Onyx UK (now Veolia Environmental Services) from Sheffield City Council. Earlier that year the old incinerator ceased operations after protests by the public and Greenpeace. At the time Greenpeace declared it the 'worst incinerator in England'. A new modern plant was commissioned in 2006 bringing it into line with the Waste Incineration Directive, with strict environmental standards. Sheffield Green Party have stated that the new incinerator is still responsible for 31,308 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per annum that would be prevented were the waste to be recycled, even taking into account that the incinerator recovers heat and power. As the UK Government's new waste strategy appears to support recycling and anaerobic digestion over Combined Heat and Power incineration for most waste streams, the role of the incinerator may have to change. In January 2012, Public Health England commissioned a research study to investigate a potential link between incinerator emissions and health outcomes to the people within the local population. The Sheffield EfW Plant was amongst one of the 22 incinerators being examined as part of this study. In 2006 when the new EfW Plant was finally fully on-stream, a report was commissioned by Veolia Environmental Services (VES) that concluded the refuse available to be recovered to the EfW Plant within the Sheffield boundary was considerably lower than that which would be needed to sustain the EfW Plant's required refuse input when other factors such as competition from other waste management services to private businesses was considered. A planning application was then posed to Sheffield City Council in 2012 to allow waste from outside of the Sheffield Waste Disposal Authority Area, and to widen the catchment area. By 2015 Veolia was processing 225,000 tonnes of refuse per annum through the EfW Plant and proceeded to make a further application to Sheffield City Council to increase this to 245,000 tonnes, This was conditionally granted in 2016. Sheffield 'Friends of the Earth' have complained and campaigned about the growth of the catchment area and the amount that is being incinerated. In 2017 details of an internal Veolia management email were leaked by the GMB union which alleged that recyclable waste was being diverted from the network of Sheffield household waste recycling centres around the city, and had been doing so since 2011. Veolia was accused of diverting the waste to try to plug a 50,000 tonne shortfall of waste needed to run the incinerator to fulfil its obligations to provide district heating for the city, despite Environment Agency regulations demanding that companies must recycle as much as they can. The GMB union was angered as GMB member workers at Veolias' recycling plant are given a bonus if recycling targets are met, and this task is made more difficult if recyclables are being diverted and incinerated. Veolia denies this and refuted the accusations. In 2017 Sheffield City Council decided to review and terminate the original terms of the 35 year PFI contract. The terms of the original 2001 contract were given a long-length due to acknowledging the investment that was needed to bring the original incinerator up to modern environmental standards and it was understood that some of this investment would need to be provided up-front by Onyx/Veolia as it was cost-prohibitive for the council to finance the incinerator's upgrade alone within allocated budgets. The cost of this expenditure would subsequently be recouped over the time of the contract in Veolias' yearly profits. The original terms didn't envisage the expansion of Veolia's waste catchment area. The council wanted to try to leverage more of the profits of the EfW Plant under renegotiated terms, and to try to reduce other expenses related to waste collection. The Integrated Waste Management contract was subsequently renegotiated and re-signed with Veolia in December 2017 in order to reduce the ongoing costs to Sheffield City Council. As part of the renegotiation, other side-benefits have become apparent for Veolia with some of the fleet network of refuse vehicles which collect the waste supply of residents that feed the EfW Plant being upgraded and converted to Electric/Hybrid.

He last played for Danish club GVI. Club career In August 2003, he left Norwegian club V√•lerenga and returned to Sweden, signing with Malm√∂ FF. While with Malm√∂, Grahn made 21 appearances and scored three goals but soon fell out of favor with coach Tom Prahl. As a result, he left the club and returned to Denmark, signing with AGF Aarhus. In his first season with Aarhus, Grahn enjoyed great success appearing in 22 league matches and scoring 8 goals and providing 13 assists as the clubs playmaker. After appearing in 47 league matches and scoring 10 goals in his two seasons at the club, Grahn was sent on loan to Odense BK for the 2006‚Äì07 season. Grahn got off to a great start with Odense scoring six goals in 15 league matches and helped the Danish club to an impressive run in the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup. As a result, he began to draw interest from clubs in the top leagues in Europe. During the winter transfer period he was sold to Spain's Gimn√†stic. On 18 February 2007, Grahn played his first La Liga match for Gimn√†stic against Racing de Santander. While with Gimn√†stic, he appeared in nine league matches and scored two goals but injuries limited his chances with the club. At the end of the season, Gimn√†stic was relegated to the Spanish Second Division, and Grahn was sent on loan to Hertha BSC in Germany. In the January transfer window of 2009, Grahn was rumored to return to Danish football, with Br√∏ndby IF being the most likely destination. On 28 January 2009, he was transferred to Danish super league club Randers on a three-year contract. Grahn was so disappointed about his own performances and lack of success at Randers FC that he offered to leave the club in November 2009. So on 12 November 2009, he was granted a free transfer by the club and returned on 14 November 2009 to Berlin for a trial with 1. FC Union Berlin. He signed for Swedish top-tier club Mj√§llby AIF before the start of the 2010 season. During his two years at the club he was a success on the pitch and a big profile at the club but also the cause of conflicts and controversial statements. During January 2012, it was reported that Grahn was close to agreeing to terms with New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer. He was also spotted near his old training grounds at Malm√∂, training by his own and wearing his old Malm√∂ FF clothes. However, in early February 2012, Grahn announced that he would be joining √ñrebro SK. After a disappointing first season where the club was relegated Grahn announced that he had come to an agreement with √ñrebro to end his contract. He told the media that playing in the second tier did not \\"harmonize with his ambitions\\". In March 2013 he signed a contract with Br√∏nsh√∏j Boldklub in the Danish 1st Division. In August 2014 he was persuaded to play for Gentofte-Vangede IF in the Danish 2nd Division East by head coach S√∏ren Fjorting whom Grahn knew from their past at Lyngby Boldklub. International career Grahn made his debut for the Sweden Under 21 national team in 2001. He made his first appearance for the full national side during January 2001 in a 0‚Äì0 draw with the Faroe Islands.

K. Beachcroft (born Charles Beachcroft Kay, 1870 - 1 July 1928) was the captain of the gold-medal-winning Great Britain cricket team at the 1900 Summer Olympics, the only time cricket has been an Olympic sport. Personal life Beachcroft was the son of a vicar, John Lowder Kay. He was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire. His father died in 1877 and Charles and his mother moved to Devon. He grew up to become a county level player in rugby, hockey and cricket, introduced the game of ping-pong to the county, and also competed in shooting. He played as opening bat for Exeter and various other local cricket teams, including Starcross. He married a local girl in 1889 and had four children before being arrested for abduction of a 17-year-old girl and living in London under the name of Charles Beachy Kay Beachcroft. The following year he married this girl, returned to Devon and took on the license of the Royal Hotel, Dawlish, under the name of C. B. Kay Beachcroft. In the 1901 census his occupation is listed as a licensed victualler. His biography (One of Life's Great Charmers: A Biography of Charles Kay) shows that he was later declared bankrupt.

It exhibited memorabilia, awards and other personal items loaned to the Centre by singer Shania Twain, who was raised in Timmins. History The Shania Twain Centre was opened on June 30, 2001. Twain, on Nov. 2, 2005, at homecoming in Timmins, Ontario. On November 2, 2004, Twain visited the Centre and officially declared it open before an audience of hundreds of fans from around the world, some of whom had queued for up to 20 hours for the opportunity of an autograph and greeting with Twain. Annual fan conventions From 2003 to 2012, fans of Shania Twain traveled to Timmins for the International Shania Twain Fan Convention. 32 fans attended the inaugural fan convention in 2003. Attendance peaked at approximately 100 for the four-day event in 2005. At subsequent conventions held each August: * 2004: Two large gifts from Twain to the Centre were unveiled: the stage from her \\"Up\\" tour and her tour bus. Twain band members Cory Churko and JD Blair attended the convention. * 2005: 100 fans attended the third convention. Drummer JD Blair and guitarist Randall Waller participated. * 2006: Drummer JD Blair and fiddler Allison Cornell attended. * 2007: 50 fans attended. Events included a karaoke night, a country party, a mini-golf tournament and Go-cart races. Drummer JD Blair and guitarist Randall Waller sent messages. * 2008-2012: conventions were held annually. Visitors at the 2011 convention included fans from the U.K., Denmark, and the U.S. Costs to the city Annual attendance for the Centre was originally projected at 50,000 but never reached above 15,000. Annual subsidies to the centre cost the city of Timmins $7 per resident, or $33.72 per centre visitor. A 2011 financial study suggested that the city council faced either closing the centre or spending $233,000 per year subsidizing its operations. Closing In May 2012, Shania Twain's management company had the singer's items repatriated to Las Vegas, removing most of the Centre's exhibits. In January 2013, Timmins city officials announced plans to sell the Centre building due to declining attendance. The land and building were sold to Goldcorp for $5 million, half the building's $10 million construction cost, as part of Goldcorp's plan to create an open-pit gold mine on the site. The Centre officially closed on February 1, 2013. Officials stated that items remaining after the centre's closure would be displayed at the city's airport and library. The building was demolished on December 3, 2014.Shania Twain Centre in Timmins is demolished.

Plot summary  The Night of Kadar tells the story of a crew of interplanetary colonists. They are transported to their new world as embryos in a state of suspended animation. As they approach their destination, the embryos experience programmed, accelerated maturation through childhood, puberty and adulthood while still asleep. The computers educate the colonists in their sleep by generating simulated childhoods for them. On their approach to a distant planet, an alien life force enters the ship. It investigates and interferes with the minds of the sleeping humans and also subtly disrupts some of the on-board systems. Upon landing on the planet, the spacecraft disassembles itself to form machinery more suited to the new world and the crew emerge from their artificial uteri as fully formed adults, each with his or her own memories of a computer simulated childhood on Earth. and the crew experiences confusion and disorientation. Due to the alien force's interference with the ship's teaching units, the humans' knowledge of their purpose on the planet is lost. Some believe they are colonists, others believe they are soldiers sent to fight some unknown enemy; this latter belief is reinforced by the large number of weapons such as missiles that have been installed by the automated systems on landing. Eventually one man, Othman, takes a position of leadership (one that is initially aggressive and autocratic, but which mellows over the years). He organizes the setup of the colony and the exploration of the world, although he has only a fragment of the manpower and equipment originally assigned to the mission. This is due to the fact that a large number of their party have, due to the alien interference, emerged from the artificial uteri as \\"morons\\" who do not speak or interact in any meaningful way with the rest of the party but seem more interested in the planet's natural environment. An interesting distinction of this novel is in the religion of the crew: they are Muslims, albeit incomplete ones. Although they have knowledge of Allah the knowledge of Islamic art, culture and ritual, as well as the traditional imagery of the Islamic heaven and hell was omitted from their computer simulated childhoods by the authors of their mission, due to the concern that such material ideas would be irrelevant on a new planet; only the spirit of the religion was preserved. Yet throughout the novel, a sense of lost heritage and memory continues to gnaw at the colonists, if only in a vague, unsettling way. By embracing their religion, they gain a measure of solace. Although Islam is a relatively minor aspect of Kadar, it does make the novel stand out from the run-of-the-mill science fiction of the 1970s, anticipating by several decades the West's newfound interest in Islam. It soon becomes clear that the settlers are on an island surrounded by a kind of quicksand. Whereas some are content to stay on this island and build their colony, their leader Othman has a seemingly irrational lean towards the nomadic way of life, and commands the building of a bridge to the mainland. Meanwhile, the \\"morons\\" associate more and more with the local indigenous inhabitants of the island; the \\"stickmen\\", creatures who are mute and largely benign, although they can protect themselves with electrical discharges. The \\"morons\\" come to be mentally linked to the stickmen, and form a kind of collective consciousness with them and the planet. The \\"morons\\" even take on the electrical defensive properties of the stickmen. The building of the bridge eventually fails as the planet enters its summer cycle after many Earth years, and the quicksand surrounding the island hardens. Othman commands his people to leave the island by walking across the hardened ground with their equipment and animals (including horses and camels) towards the mainland that had been the objective of the failed causeway. At the same time, the morons and the stickmen leave the island together in the opposite direction from Othman's people, with the exception of one, F'Dar, who unknowingly had caused Othman's right-hand man, Jessum, to be disabled in an accident, and stays with Jessum as his servant out of a sense of responsibility. Soon, however, some enormous, beetle-like creatures do pose a threat. The colonists also have occasional run-ins with a strange, glowing whirlwind that appears and disappears without warning. Eventually, after a series of travels and adventures, the colonists discover a tribe of fierce, brutish humans. These savages vastly outnumber Othman's people, and eventually overwhelm them. At the end of the novel, Osman and his men learn the truth; these primitive people are from another spacecraft, and Othman deduces that his own mission (as evidenced by the many weapons observed in the beginning) was to establish a base to protect these other people. This second tribe of humans have likewise been interfered with by the alien force, but to much greater detriment than Othman's people. These unfortunates have lost all knowledge of modern technology, and know no better than to turn broken bits of equipment into primitive weapons for slaughter. In the end, the reader learns that all of the tribulations of Othman and his people were machinations of an alien life force. The same being that had disrupted the minds of the crew in the first place has been operating the glowing whirlwinds as a kind of mobile, remote monitor, controlled by formless aliens on a nearby planet. In the end, Othman, now a much wiser and gentler man, reunited with his wife, Silandi, with whom he had become estranged early in the novel, continues to lead his people in their nomadic, Bedu-like existence, in which they have found some degree of contentment, with new generations replacing the original settles. Eventually, only Othman and F'Dar remain; the elderly and highly revered sole survivors of the original group. Eventually F'Dar dies, after possibly receiving a telepathic signal from a bird, aided by one of the new children whom he has trained to understand the telepathic patterns of the planet, that his own people, the \\"morons\\" survived their own exodus with the stickmen. Othman is then left the lone original member of the spacecraft's crew still living, but is a contented man.

He used a variety of names, including Belford Hendricks, Belford Cabell Hendricks, Belford Clifford Hendricks, Sinky Hendricks, and Bill Henry. Hendricks is primarily remembered as the co-composer of numerous soft-R&B; songs of the 1950s, many in collaboration with Clyde Otis and Brook Benton, and as an accomplished arranger. His versatility allowed him to write in various styles, from big band swing for Count Basie, through blues ballads for Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan, R&B-influenced; pop for Benton and country and western numbers for Nat King Cole and Al Martino, to early soul for Aretha Franklin. Early life and education Hendricks was born in Evansville, Indiana, United States, to Frank Hendricks, a lifelong learner with an eighth- grade education, and Melissa Belle (Logan) Hendricks, a graduate of Evansville's Clark High School (Evansville, Indiana). He had two siblings, Paul Lawrence and Dorothy Medesta. His love for music began when his father brought home a piano, quickly learning how to play additional instruments. In high school, he participated in band. In 1924, Hendricks graduated from the town's then-segregated Douglass High School, later rebuilt and renamed Lincoln High School. After taking several years off, working at local establishments, he enrolled at the Indiana State Teachers' College, now known as Indiana State University, in Terre Haute. Often diverted from his education for semesters at a time by a need to earn money and a desire to practice his musical craft, Hendricks road to graduation was a decade long. As well as taking jobs in local restaurants and hotels, Hendricks was able to play piano with bands in the area. In 1935, he joined the elite one percent of Black Americans with a college degree, having majored in science and music. Marriage and army service Hendricks married Mae Etta Bean of North Vernon, Indiana, a classmate studying to become an elementary school teacher. After spending a year in Maryland, Bean returned to Indiana. They divorced in the 1940s. Bean died in the early 1960s. Though these were considered plum jobs reserved for white people, Hendricks, with the help of relative William Fauntleroy, was one of three African Americans able to secure a job as a postal carrier by 1939. On postal records, however, he is recorded as being white. At the height of the Great Depression, Hendricks earned nearly triple the national average income. In 1938 or 1939, Duke Ellington and his orchestra recorded, \\"I'll Come Back for More\\", which appears to be the first recorded song co-written by Hendricks. It was written with Ellington, Brick Fleagle, Oramay Riamond, Rex Stewart, and Bee Walker. In 1942, Hendricks was drafted into the United States Army, serving in a medical unit. He was stationed in New York, Arizona and Hawaii. Hendricks contributed a song, \\"Marching Through Berlin\\" that was sung by Ethel Merman in the 1943 wartime movie, Stage Door Canteen. Jet magazine of the 1980s shows him accompanying popular songstress Lena Horne. After the war, Hendricks returned to Indiana to care for his aging parents. During this period, he co-hosted Toast and Coffee, one of the first interracial radio programs in the US, though most listeners were unaware he was black. During this period, he became acquainted with Emma Clinton, a native of Texas, who worked for Jane Blaffer Owen, heir to the Humble Oil fortune (now known as Exxon-Mobil). The Owens family helped resettle the community of New Harmony, Indiana north of Evansville, which fell into disrepair. New York years Although he already was middle-aged, Hendricks decided to move to New York to pursue a full-time musical career. He continued his musical education, studying composition and organ at New York University. He knew a member of the Count Basie Orchestra and being able to play most instruments, he was able to substitute for musicians when they were ill or went on vacation. During his early years in New York, Hendricks studied the math-based Schillinger Method of composition and arranging under Rudolph Schramm. The Schillinger Method, developed in the 1940s, is the foundation of composition education at the Berklee School of Music. By the mid-1950s, he met Clyde Otis. In 1957, Otis accepted a job as the first black A&R; man at Mercury Records and asked Hendricks to become his right hand man. Washington and Benton Soon after arriving in New York City, he met Dinah Washington. They enjoyed several chart hits, the most enduring being \\"What a Difference a Day Makes\\", which reached number 4 in the US Billboard R&B; chart and number 8 in the US pop charts in 1959. \\"Unforgettable\\" and \\"This Bitter Earth\\" are also notable hits. Hendricks arranged and conducted nearly 100 songs for Washington from February 1959 to January 1961, but today most of them are considered to be mediocre and boring, compared to Washington's jazz/blues-oriented recordings until 1958. Even more successful were the light-hearted duets which Hendricks arranged for Washington and Brook Benton in 1960. \\"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\\" made number 1 in the United States R&B; chart and number 5 in the pop charts, earning over $1 million, whilst \\"A Rockin' Good Way (to Mess Around and Fall in Love)\\" also made number 1 in the R&B; chart and number 7 in the pop chart. Hendricks had a closer musical relationship with Benton than the one he enjoyed with Washington, for, in addition to arranging many of the popular baritone's recordings, he also co-wrote numerous songs with him, often together with Otis. The Hendricks-Otis-Benton composition \\"It's Just a Matter of Time\\", arranged by Hendricks and performed by Benton, went to number 3 in the pop chart in 1959 and became a country music standard, with new interpretations reaching number 1 in the United States country charts twice: first in 1970, sung by Sonny James, and again in 1989, courtesy of Randy Travis. Other successful arrangements by Hendricks for Benton included \\"Thank You Pretty Baby\\", \\"Kiddio\\", and \\"The Boll Weevil Song\\". Still at Mercury, with Sarah Vaughan As Hendricks' stature as an arranger grew, Mercury Records paired him with Sarah Vaughan. His arrangements for her produced one minor US hit, \\"Smooth Operator\\", written by Otis with Murray Stein and some takes on older songs, such as \\"My Ideal\\", \\"I Should Care\\", Irving Berlin's \\"Maybe It's Because I Love You Too Much\\" and versions of Mack Gordon and Harry Revel's \\"Never in a Million Years\\" and Charlie Chaplin's \\"Eternally\\". The song \\"Broken Hearted Melody\\" selected by arranger Belford Hendricks for Sarah Vaughan to record became the most successful recording of her entire career with the accompanying Belford Hendricks Orchestra. Columbia years By 1960, Hendricks and Otis had been recruited by Columbia Records. Hendricks and Otis also took an unsuccessful crack at making Aretha Franklin a star. The team recorded dozens of tracks, including \\"Can't You Just See Me.\\" By 1966, Columbia had lost about $90,000 on Franklin's recordings. However, decades after her hard-won success, those recordings were released. Nat King Cole had already recorded some Hendricks co-compositions such as \\"Nothing In The World\\" and \\"Looking Back\\" in the late 1950s, and when he and his producers at Capitol Records decided to record \\"Ramblin' Rose\\" in 1962. The result was a worldwide hit and Hendricks was asked to submit arrangements for a full album in a similar country and western vein. When that brought more success, Hendricks arranged a follow-up Cole-meets-country album, Dear Lonely Hearts, whose title track became another singles chart hit. With other artists Among other stars with whom Hendricks worked were big band leaders Jimmie Lunceford and Sy Oliver, Ivory Joe Hunter, Carmen McRae, Timi Yuro, Aretha Franklin, for whom Hendricks arranged songs such as \\"A Mother's Love\\", \\"Runnin' Out of Fools\\" and his own composition, \\"Can't You Just See Me\\". When Al Martino, whose sub- operatic singing style had gone out of fashion in the early 1960s, wanted to develop a more understated vocal technique, Nat King Cole recommended that he contact Hendricks for help. Martino duly got his desired new sound and, to go with it, his biggest hit for years - a Hendricks-arranged reworking of the country song \\"I Love You Because\\", which got to number 3 on the Billboard pop chart in 1963. A full album followed, with Hendricks at the helm. Hendricks composed over a hundred songs, more than half of them co-written, using either a variant of his real name or his complete pseudonym, Bill Henry. As well as the compositions for other stars mentioned above, these included \\"Call Me\\", a US number 21 for Johnny Mathis in 1958 (not to be confused with the later Tony Hatch-composed song of the same name), \\"First Star I See Tonight\\" for Patti Page, \\"I'm Too Far Gone (to Turn Around)\\" for Bobby Bland and \\"The Mixed Up Cup\\" for Clyde McPhatter. Other artists to record music composed or arranged by Belford Hendricks are Nancy Wilson, Mary Wells, Della Reese, Bobby Darin, Glen Campbell, Freddie Scott, Roy Hamilton, Julie London, Brenda Lee, Charlie Pride, Tom Jones, Ruth Brown, E.J. Decker, The Beach Boys, Bobby Womack, The Four Freshmen, Garnet Mimms, Carla Thomas, Tammy Wynette, Diane Schuur, Marty Robbins, Sam Cooke, Liza Minnelli, Jack Scott, Aretha Franklin, Leslie Uggams, Ella Fitzgerald, Ace Cannon, Gregory Isaacs, B.B. King, Little Anthony and the Imperials, Elvis Presley, Carmen McRae, Duke Ellington, Teddy Pendergrass, Natalie Cole, The Drifters, The Temptations, Jerry Butler, Jimmy Smith, Dizzy Gillespie, Chubby Checker, Etta James, Randy Travis, Sonny James, Doris Day, Jackie Wilson, The Delfonics, The Four Tops, The Five Blind Boys of Alabama, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Donna Summer, Ike and Tina Turner, The Stylistics, Ricky Nelson, Ruby and The Romantics, and the long list of artist recording Belford \\"Sinky\\" Hendricks music continues. According to David Leander Williams, author, music historian, and writer of the books Indianapolis Jazz (2014) and of Indianapolis Rhythm And Blues (2019), \\"The name Belford Hendricks must go down in history as the greatest arranger of rhythm-and-blues hits of all times\\".David Leander Williams (2019), Indianapolis Rhythm and Blues.

Gnosis was published by the Lumen Foundation, a San Francisco-based non-profit organization incorporated in California by Jay Kinney and Dixie Tracy-Kinney to produce educational material, including a print magazine, on the Western esoteric tradition. Initial fund-raising resulted in a 5,000-copy print run of the first issue. The first issues were produced on a volunteer basis from a home office, but within three years the Lumen Foundation and Gnosis established permanent headquarters near Mission Dolores in San Francisco. In 1986, the writer Richard Smoley began contributing to the magazine and went on to become its managing editor (briefly) and then, beginning in 1990, its editor for eight years. By 1990, Gnosis counted a circulation of 11,000 and went on to achieve a peak circulation of 16,000.Faith.com During its run, Gnosis published interviews with such significant thinkers and teachers as Huston Smith, Karen Armstrong, Graham Hancock, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Colin Wilson, Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, Kathleen Raine, David Steindl-Rast, Claudio Naranjo, R.

Originally, Haraappan Dam was 500 meters south. Actual overflow of the water from the dam was collected by a small reservoir near the old Bharasar (Harappan time - 2000BC). It was called Bhara Sar, which refers to Sarovar, suggesting a lake was located there. Later, Maharao shri Bharmalji resettled the Village, and it was called a new name, Bhara Sar. Overflow of dam water from the reservoir was utilised for irrigation in the lower area by means of ground water channels cut in the stones of the grounds.

Aside from her translations of many Marxist classics into English, she is perhaps best known for her unfinished biography of the important labour activist, Tom Mann, Tom Mann and his Times (London, 1956). Early life Dona Torr was the daughter of William Torr, afterwards vicar of Eastham and Hon. Canon of Chester Cathedral. She had three sisters and two younger brothers. The Torr family was listed in Burke's Landed Gentry and her grandfather, John Torr, had been a wealthy merchant in Liverpool, a Conservative M.P., and staunch Anglican. Dona attended University College, London, on and off, completing a BA Honours degree in English before the First World War. Career Before the formation of the Communist Party Torr was a librarian at the Daily Herald (run by George Lansbury), where she met her future husband, Walter Holmes. In 1920, she was a founder member (albeit not a prominent one) of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Thereafter she worked in behind-the- scenes roles, aiding with party publications, and acting as a courier during the General Strike in London in 1926. She also travelled to Moscow as a translator for the Fifth Congress of the Communist International where the proceedings were largely conducted in German, which was her main linguistic skill, it is unlikely she was fluent in Russian. She also was to do work at the Marx-Engels Institute, where she translated into English the official Soviet German language edition of the Correspondence of Marx and Engels (London, 1934). This made her name as something of a Marxist scholar back in Britain, and she was thereafter to oversee the preparation of a special facsimile edition of Marx's Capital for George Allen and Unwin. Torr worked at the party publishing house, Martin Lawrence (the initials, \\"M.L.\\", being an allusion to Marx and Lenin), which later merged with a leftist literary firm to become Lawrence and Wishart, where she was to work closely with former poet Douglas Garman. To celebrate the tercentenary of the English Revolution of 1640, in 1940, they commissioned young Oxford don, Christopher Hill to edit a set of three essays English Revolution, possibly connected with the plans for a \\"Faculty of History\\" at the party training centre, Marx House in London. This was intended Summary of 2004 doctoral dissertation Her husband, Walter Holmes, was a journalist on the Daily Herald and during the 1920s for the Communist Party, he worked on the Sunday Worker and during the 1930s was to be a significant and politically orthodox writer for the Daily Worker with postings in Russia, and even visiting Manchuria to cover the Japanese attacks on China, which he recounted in Eyewitness in Manchuria, it is possible that Dona Torr went with him. However, she seldom wrote any material for the main papers published by the party, and only occasionally wrote for party journals such as Labour Monthly, controlled by Party leader Rajani Palme Dutt. Influence As early as 1936, Torr had set herself the task of promoting historical study in the party. She had begun work on her Tom Mann biography, publishing an interim booklet in 1936. She wrote to the party ideologue, Palme Dutt, that she saw the need to \\"breed new historians, awaken and train them\\". She was active in forming a \\"Marxist Historians' Group\\" in 1938, and the later \\"Historians' Group\\" in 1946. One of those most generous in his praise of Torr was E.P. Thompson, who spent many years working closely with her on a biography of William Morris, which was published by the party. At that stage in his party career, he was best known, not as an historian, but as a prominent member of the party's Writers' Group. He described his gratitude to Dona Torr in the \\"Preface\\": While there can be no doubt of her assiduousness, what sort of actual \\"influence\\" she had on Thompson's later methodological developments in history is debatable. Rightly famed for his main pioneering works of \\"History From Below\\" (or \\"From the Bottom Up\\"), Thompson's first major work, Morris, shows little if any such techniques or approaches. His major work, The Making of the English Working Class, was penned well after Torr's death, many years after he had left the party in a blaze of acrimony. Other well-known academic members of the party's Historians' Group, including Christopher Hill and John Saville, published a collection of essays in her honour, Democracy and the Labour Movement, many other members sought to contribute, but there were too many. Hill, one of those most fond of Torr, wrote the \\"Preface\\" for the editorial team and it is often quoted as evidence of her impact on the whole Group: Much of her work with these young academic historians in the party was to promote their use of Marxist analysis in the then nascent field of \\"Labour History\\" ‚Äì and especially to give it a Communist spin. As both \\"Prefaces\\" state, she was very generous with her time, and when draft work was sent to her she made a major effort to check it and comment accordingly. In this sense she was an ideal type of \\"editor for young writers, who due to hostility to Communism could usually only have their work published by the party publisher Lawrence and Wishart, by its wholly owned subsidiary \\"Cobbett Press\\", or by its a few allied firms, such as \\"Frederick Muller\\". Apart from a sophisticated grasp of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism, she showed no signs of adopting original methodologies, nor showed a remarkable use of archives in her other works. There is also no evidence of an attempt to pioneer oral history in her own main work with Tom Mann as she researched with him on the biography of him for the party's commemorative efforts with the old veteran. She cannot be seen as the founder of a new style of historical research, unlike Georges Lefebvre or the Annales School in France. Nonetheless, one form of enduring organisational influence stemmed from Torr's circle, from the creation by Historians' Group members of two offshoots: the academic journal Past & Present, and, later, the Labour History Review. The former went on to create an associated society, more often associated with medieval and early modern studies. After her death, the \\"Moderns\\" (a sub-section of the group) reached out to others to form the Society of Labour History, which survives to the present day, and publishes a distinguished journal of its own. Indirectly, the Historians' Group which she helped to found, and its members, also led to the formation of History Workshop and to other leftist conferences and events to further the study of history in Britain. Often rejected by the mainstream of academic historians, these efforts by successors of Torr and her Historians' Group, have persisted, some in adult education, or precariously on the edges of academe, but they have never died out, crafting a wide variety of cultural studies, feminist works, and more traditional labour histories. In 2017, she featured in a conference, London's Women Historians, held at the Institute of Historical Research.London's Women Historians.

College career Clary closed out his K-State career as one of the top offensive tackles in the Big Twelve Conference, where he excelled on the field, as well as in the classroom. He was selected to the Academic All- District VII team as a senior and was also a three-time Academic All-Big Twelve first-team selection. During his collegiate career, Clary showed his versatility by playing both tackle positions. Clary proved to be an extremely durable player during his Wildcat career, starting 37 consecutive games over his final three seasons. Clary earned his bachelor's degree in psychology and graduated in December 2005. Professional career The San Diego Chargers selected Clary out of Kansas State with their pick in the sixth round (no. 187 overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, Clary spent the year on the Chargers' practice squad. Clary became a starter late in the 2007 season. A reserve for most of the year, the coaches inserted him into the starting lineup at right tackle in early December to give the team‚Äôs struggling running game a spark. Over the final five games, the Chargers rushed for 880 yards, scored eight touchdowns and went 5-0. Clary‚Äôs ascension into the starting lineup helped the Chargers capture the AFC West title en route to a berth in the AFC Championship Game. Clary earned the starting right tackle spot in mini camp. Following the 2008 season, he was awarded $405,859 in additional pay from the NFL's performance-based pay system, which gives financial compensation based on a comparison of playing time to salary; this made him the biggest beneficiary in 2008.Bonus Pay SI.com, 2009 Clary re-signed a one- year contract with the Chargers during the 2009 off-season.Clary Signs Exclusive Rights Tender With Chargers Yahoo Sports, March 17, 2009 Clary was the Chargers‚Äô winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in 2010 after recovering from a serious ankle injury in 2009 that required surgery.

Specifically, it is an examination of the dual interaction in which geographical traits of a territory affect the political decisions, and the geographical structure of the election system affects electoral results. The purpose of the analysis is to identify and understand driving factors and the electoral characteristics of territories in a broad and integrative manner.Agnew, John. 1996. ‚ÄúMapping politics: how context counts in electoral geography‚Äù.

Routledge: New York. and conducting elections in democracies requires the translation of the political decisions of the distributed voting public into resulting ‚Äúseat‚Äù representation of the various constituencies, except in the cases of Israel and the Netherlands which each have only a single constituency. Johnston, Ron. 2002. ‚ÄúManipulating maps and winning elections: measuring the impact of malapportionment and gerrymandering‚Äù. In Political Geography, Volume 21, pp. 1-31. Elsevier: Atlanta. It is philosophically accepted that in a democracy, each vote is equally valid amongst all other votes and thus each eligible voter casts only one equally valued vote. However, disproportionality and bias towards specific voting groups arise in the construction of artificial constituency boundaries in that political parties and policies are unevenly and inaccurately represented in the aggregate results amongst the electoral regions when compared to the popular vote. Electoral constituencies The territorial unit with boundary distinctions in representative elections is commonly termed the constituency, district, or precinct, and serves as both a region for the tabulation and study of the electoral result. These boundaries are defined in various methods, which are unique to each state, and can cause alterations or skewing of aggregate vote results and by extension the true decision of the electorate. Election mechanics Electoral geographers require the knowledge of the local and statewide laws and procedures for conducting elections, though it has been claimed that it is not within their purview to attempt to correct any observed flaws.Prescott, J.R.V. 1959. ‚ÄúThe Function and Methods of Electoral Geography‚Äù. In Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Volume 49, Issue 3, pp. 296 ‚Äì 304. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: Hoboken. The details of voting or the parameters of the election in various states or in constituencies within the state are critical factors, which affect the levels of participation and can characterize the outcome. The mechanics of an election are fully described through identifying the pattern of constituencies, franchise qualifications and changes, and the method of the election. The patterning of constituencies is related to the spatial orientation and drawing of boundaries as detailed previously. The franchise qualifications define the eligible voter bloc, the electorate, and thus determine the range of relevant, critical issues, which apply to those who vote in an election, and alterations in enfranchisement can greatly alter the nature of the electorate and the outcome of the election. The methods of election are critical to analyzing the results, as it is impossible to adequately assess the proportionality of representation or validity of an electoral outcome without understanding how votes are cast and counted. For example, single-vote, winner take all systems can greatly disenfranchise minority voters as their selection is ultimately irrelevant in a two-party dominant system. However, in systems which employ proportional voting or ranked voting techniques, the extreme minorities receive greater opportunity for representation. Electoral distortion and bias Regardless of the means by which boundaries are drawn, including by non-partisan or independent governmental associations, bias in electoral regions can always be observed. The United Kingdom serves as an example as the constituencies are established by a non-partisan commission and yet bias toward Labour has been observed in general elections since 1979. Gerrymandering Gerrymandering is a selective drawing of constituency boundaries in order to alter the results of an election. The popular or numerical election results within a constituency, precinct, or electoral district can be distorted by the act of gerrymandering. Common alterations to election results caused by gerrymandering are: * Splitting or dilution of the concentrations of votes for one party so as to make that party the minority in a large portion of the constituencies in conjunction *Concentrating the votes of one party into a selected few constituencies such that many of their votes are ‚Äòwasted‚Äô, while creating many constituencies with only slight majorities in favor of the other party * Placing two or more incumbents of one party within a single revised constituency, thus removing control of seats for that party * Creating \\"winner takes all\\" multi-member districts with one party in the majority Malapportionment Malapportionment is unequal and disproportionate representation electoral systems with multiple constituencies. It is a violation of the democratic principle of ‚Äúone person, one vote‚Äù in that constituency boundaries enclose populations of various size, which means that the votes of people in regions of lower population have greater representation per vote than those in regions with a higher population. The effect of malapportionment is observed when equivalent percentages of the total vote results in different numbers of seats for each party due to one party having greater control in smaller constituencies and another in larger constituencies. Geographic context The spatial distribution and variation of the voting populace in conjunction with the demographic characteristics and delineation of voting regions provide a geographic context for the analysis of elections. Along with purely physical characteristics, distribution of economic resources, lines of communication, governmental and party platforms, and gender, ethnic, or class groups creates an interwoven fabric of people and opinion, which is accounted for in electoral analysis. A population settles for various social, economic, and cultural reasons which create a defined contour of both population density and related political opinion. However, this contour is not a static condition and changes in electoral results must be considered with respect to the change in the type of people and not just the change in their chosen politics. The distribution of politics has been attributed to various factors, one of which is described as a convergence of external stimuli. These stimuli can come in the form of state-supplied information, local cultural norms, religious affiliations, economic opportunity, and media presentation of issues. The degree of effect for each particular stimulus is then a result of the susceptibility of a particular geography. For example, policy dealing with the governmental treatment of an urban population would have greater importance to those in a territory with an urban densities and a far smaller importance in a sparser region.Morrill, Richard, Knopp, Larry and Brown, Michael. 2007. ‚ÄúAnomalies in red and blue: Exceptionalism in American electoral geography‚Äù. In Political Geography, Volume 26, pp. 525-553. Elsevier: Atlanta. A state or its political organizations has some power to affect these stimuli and are therefore considered as a contributing factor in the changes of election outcomes. Physical contour Electoral geography considers the way in which the physical characteristics of a territory directly affect the population and thus the election decision of these people. The geographic location and associated natural factors are directly related to the potential in a specific region for political development and have an additional relationship with the electoral processes and policy decisions of the region. The study of electoral results has been shown to identify the regions of specific politics and the relative cohesion amongst these similar regions. Regions which share large numbers of physical or demographic characteristics, or both as these two factors are related, will demonstrate significant similarities in voting participation and patterns of outcome. Economics, communications, and infrastructure The economic development within a given region is also related to the development of its politics and the issues which are important to the electorate. A state with disproportionate economic development will necessarily come under pressure from the poorer constituencies to take action to redistribute wealth and level the economic prosperity, which will be observable in the electoral results. The range and availability of communication and issue awareness can affect perception of issues and skew rational decision making. If a populace is generally unaware of the implications of policy decisions they are less able to make informed decisions and are more readily manipulated by candidate or party claims and marketing techniques, which can make analysis difficult as no predictable rationale may exist for voting outcomes. Culture, demographics, and political parties Background information detailing the established political parties, issues being contested in an election, and the mechanics of the election process also help to contextualize and understanding contributing factors in each individual election. Over time these factors may be changed as parties are formed or disbanded and policy issues are brought to vote or become obsolete, which can explain the shifting appearance of the electoral result over a period of time. The governmental and party platforms serve as categories into which voters are forced to classify themselves even though it is likely that no one party platform accurately captures the entirety of the opinions held by a voter. This makes consideration of the party platform or recent party activities critical in understanding the changes or stability of electoral results over space and time. Gender, ethnic, and class disparity can cause voting that is related to shared background qualities and experience as opposed to political opinions. This means that candidates from a particular area or common ethnicity can receive votes from the citizens of that area irrespective of their party affiliations or national because of their shared experience and mutual acquaintance. This has been referred to as the ‚Äúfriends and neighbors effect‚Äù. Determinism There is a distinction amongst geographers between considering the effect of geography to be fully deterministic and merely having only a partial effect amongst other effects. Deterministic electoral geography would result in predictable results regardless of candidate or proposed policy as the sum of physical geographic traits would entirely control voting decisions. This interpretation has been widely rejected by geographers. Instead, it is more fully accepted that geography plays some role in conjunction with other cultural and interpersonal effects. The ‚Äúneighborhood effect‚Äù is an observed altering of electoral results due to the tendency of people who are spatially close to vote similarly because of daily interactions. Arguments against determinism also rely on observed anomalies in voting results. An example arises in comparing results of presidential elections in the United States to the expectation of favoring Democratic or Republican candidates in urban or rural locations respectively or the expectations for preference on the county scale based on racial composition with minority groups favoring the Democratic party. The results indicate that anomalies occur in distinct voting areas where the Republican or Democratic candidate won counties that had opposite characteristics of their traditionally carried counties. These anomalies are attributed to the historical, economic, and cultural geographies which serve to override the territory traits that were used to predict the electoral results. In this way voters are motivated by factors outside their geography to vote in a way that is unexpected and often even contrary to their individual interests. Electoral mapping The spatial variations of support for particular policies are routinely mapped in order to pictorially represent the electoral geography of a territory, which can allow for the recognition of patterns of location. Ron Johnston considers the entire process and outcome of the election through the examining lens of territory maps. He claims that electoral results are the outcome of superimposing the map of cultural, economic, religious, and demographic characteristics with the determined map of electoral districts and applying the issues on the ballot. The selection of mapping paradigms using color, patterning, brightness or darkness effects is employed in order to visually detail aspects and characteristics of interest in elections, such as voter participation, intensity of support, population density, and constituency boundaries which may not easily be noticed by considering words and numbers. An example of a mapping paradigm is observed in United States elections in recent history, wherein results in favor of Democratic candidates are marked by coloring the constituency blue and using red for results in favor of Republican candidates. This has been used to a wide degree and is thus readily acknowledged by United States citizens in the media and academic display of election results. However, the variations in electoral results over a territory or place cannot be directly equated to the land areas represented by mapping as the voting populace is the subject of interest and study in electoral geography and not the particular territory they live on during a given election. Human movement is an ongoing progress, which consistently redefines the distributions of policy preference and thus the associated election decisions. Thus the passage of time must be incorporated in electoral analysis through the duality of Electoral geography also deals with the alterations of election results in a given place over an extended time interval encompassing many elections. This effect can be mapped using various techniques which help to show changing opinions and changing populations in the constituencies of the state over a time interval. Electoral geography relies upon detailed and accurate mapping techniques with appropriate contextualization and background knowledge in order to successfully visualize and analyze the results of an election. World electoral geographies Canada Canadian electoral geography is typified by a high degree of political regionalism, with most disputes interpreted as conflicts between provinces or regions. Notably, class consciousness is quite low in Canada as compared to the former mother country, Britain. Because of the disparity in the population size of the various provinces, their importance in electoral geography varies substantially. As well some provinces are small enough and similar enough to their neighbours that they vote similarly, while others are large enough to have considerable internal divisions. The smaller Atlantic Provinces might be considered as unit, but Ontario might be subdivided between the urban, suburban, rural, and remote regions, or between north, south, east, and west, or into more specific regions like the Golden Horseshoe or the Greater Toronto Area. In federal politics, a winning coalition must be composed of various sub-regions, identified not only by place but by ideology. A winning coalition might include Western social conservatives, suburban Ontario moderates, and Quebec soft nationalists (Brian Mulroney, 1984, 1988), or Ontario moderates, Quebec federalists, and most of Atlantic Canada (Jean Chretien, 1993, 1997, 2000), or most of the West and Atlantic Canada, plus rural and suburban Ontario (Stephen Harper, 2011). When the main parties are not seen to serve the interest of a particular region, protest parties or movements often emerge. This has included several Quebec nationalist parties, parties arising from the phenomenon called Western alienation, and the Maritime Rights Movement. Partly for this reason, Canada has typically had a multi-party system for much of its history rather than the two-party system that is typical of first past the post elections. This has in turn led to several minority governments in Canada. Regionalism in Canada is such that is also notable within provinces on the stage of provincial elections. There is considerable distinction between the politics of Montreal and those of the Saguenay or the Gaspe, and likewise between the Lower Mainland and the BC Interior. United Kingdom In the present United Kingdom, electoral geography is studied extensively and has been compared to the method in the United States of elections and regionalization, by employing UK methods of class cleavage, where the Conservative Party tends to be favoured by the white-collar class and the Labour Party by the UK‚Äôs working class.Johnston, Ron. 2005. ‚ÄúAnglo-American Electoral Geography: Same Roots and Same Goals, but Different Means to Ends?‚Äù. In Professional Geographer, pp. 580‚Äì587. Blackwell Publishing: Oxford. Comparing the methods of sectionalism in the UK and the US places emphasis on location; instead of basing support for a party by class, the US does so by location. In the UK, some areas are more heavily populated than others, giving differences in population relating to the geography of each individual voting district. In the UK, to extinguish regional identity, England was divided into nine regions.Denver, David. Elections and Voters in Britain. Palgrave Macmillan: New York. It was thought that people who congregate seem to vote alike, rather than voting on one‚Äôs own opinions. This is what is known as the \\"neighborhood effect\\". Even with nine distinct regions, the voting patterns are seemingly disproportionally divided between the two dominant parties. This forces researchers to question what causes regional differences in voting outcomes. The voting method in the UK differs from that of the United States. To produce an outcome, \\"all voting takes place in the context of a particular electoral system. There has to be some agreed way of aggregating votes to produce a result. Votes indicate individuals‚Äô preferences and in the public elections these have to be translated into seats by some formula\\". This formulaic approach ends in an outcome giving a translated number of seats for each party in Parliament. England is not alone in selecting its electoral system. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ A cross-national study found seventy different systems in twenty- seven democracies.‚ÄùDemko, George, K. and Wood, William, B. Reordering the World. 1994. Westview Press: Oxford. When choosing which system a government will use, great consideration has to be made. A serious question arises during this process; What should this election be designed to achieve? General answers have been: * To enable the representation of voters‚Äô opinion in rough proportion to their strength in the electorate * To allow for the representation of geographically defined areas * To decisively confer power on a team of leaders or a party.‚Äù Voter awareness in terms of the reasoning, motivation, and methods of an election are critical for shoring up public support for the legitimacy of elections and elected officials. Russia The electoral geography of Russia is marked by the obvious territorial cleavages between North and South, urban and rural territories, etc. One phenomenon of territorial cleavages in electoral preferences in Russia is known as the \\"red belt\\" (compact located regions with high support for the Communist Party). In the first democratic elections in the history of contemporary Russia it was noticed that liberal and democratic politicians had much higher support in the northern regions, whereas the south of Russia appeared more conservative. Both capitals in Russia - Moscow and the \\"northern capital\\" Saint Petersburg - significantly differ in electoral results from the rest of the country. Only in these cities is there strong electoral support of liberal and democratic politicians. Support for United Russia is lower than in other regions. United States The electoral geography of the United States is a description of regional political differences, which in recent years has been popularized by the red and blue paradigm to pictorially represent Republican and Democratic Election results. The presence of a two- dominant party system creates a great potential for disenfranchisement of minority voters and their opinions. Qualities of ‚Äúnortheasterliness‚Äù, ‚Äúwesterliness‚Äù, and ‚Äúsoutherliness‚Äù, which constitute the expectations for Democratic, Republican, and volatile Republican voting results, have been used in order to understand and define the political landscape. However, culturally driven anomalies in this general expectation have been observed. Debate has been common in recent elections in regards to the election of the President of the United States via the electoral college. The debate stems from the fact that the electoral college is a malapportioned body.,Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States\\"2006 Census estimates\\".

The weapon was also known as the Windb√ºchse (\\"wind rifle\\" in German). One of the rifle's more famous associations is its use on the Lewis and Clark Expedition to explore and map the western part of North America in the early 1800s. History and use The Girardoni air rifle was in service with the Austrian army from 1780 to around 1815. Many references to the Girardoni air rifles mention lethal combat ranges of 125 to 150 yards and some extend that range considerably. The advantages of a high rate of fire, no smoke from propellants, and low muzzle report granted it acceptance. It did have problems and was eventually removed from service for several reasons decades after introduction. There was also a version sold to civilians after it was removed from military service. While the detachable air reservoir was capable of around 30 shots, it took nearly 1,500 strokes of a hand pump to fill those reservoirs. Later, a wagon mounted pump was provided. The reservoirs, made from hammered sheet iron held together with rivets and sealed by brazing, proved very difficult to manufacture using the techniques of the period and were always in short supply. In addition, the weapon was very delicate and a small break in the reservoir could make it inoperable. It was also very different from any other weapon of the time, requiring extensive training to use. The Lewis and Clark Expedition used the rifle in the demonstrations that they performed for nearly every Native American tribe they encountered on the expedition.Girardoni air rifle as used by Lewis and Clark.

Some of the weapons were also made using a gravity fed magazine. Unlike its contemporary, muzzle-loading muskets, which required the rifleman to stand up to reload with powder and ball, the shooter could reload a ball from the magazine by pulling a transverse chamber bar out of the breech which allowed a ball to be supplied to it and which then rebounded back to its original position with the aid of a spring, all while lying down.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=77hTDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PR4&dq;=Prenderghast+Firearms&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjZ3cSWw- XoAhUEZcAKHSkeBkAQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q;=Girandoni&f;=false Contemporary regulations of 1788 required that each rifleman, in addition to the rifle itself, be equipped with three compressed air reservoirs (two spare and one attached to the rifle), cleaning stick, hand pump, lead ladle, and 100 lead balls, 1 in the chamber, 19 in the magazine built into the rifle and the remaining 80 in four tin tubes. Equipment not carried attached to the rifle was held in a special leather knapsack. It was also necessary to keep the leather gaskets of the reservoir moist in order to maintain a good seal and prevent leakage.A letter detailing regulations, \\"Signed, Vienna, 24th January 1788\\"; reproduced in Baker, G; Currie, C. The Austrian Army Repeating Air Rifle 2nd Ed., 2007. The air reservoir was in the club shaped stock. With a full air reservoir, the Girardoni air rifle had the capacity to shoot 30 shots at useful pressure. These balls were effective to approximately on a full air reservoir. The power declined as the air reservoir was emptied.Military writer August Haller claimed in an 1891 treatise Die √∂sterreichische Milit√§r- Repetier-Windb√ºchse that the first ten shots would be effective to about 150 paces, the next ten shots up to 120-125 paces, the next ten out to 100 paces, and then the remaining air pressure in the reservoir would be too low. Design- wise, the air reservoir was similar to the disposable carbon dioxide cartridges used on some modern air guns. Importance The Girardoni air rifle was an important first. It was the first repeating rifle of a specific general kind to enter general military service. It was one of the first uses of a tubular magazine.

His work in the area of human genetics and liver disease led him to define the genetic nature of Wilson's disease, which affects the liver and brain, and showed that the disease was associated with a deficiency in the blood of ceruloplasmin, a copper-binding protein. He also discovered that the urine level of B2 microglobulin, was a sensitive indicator of proximal renal tubular damage.

Known for comedic impressions, Valen has also pursued a serious music career; his pop music album Listen When Alone was released internationally in Europe and Asia. Valen was asked by Katherine Jackson to perform his song \\"Still Here\\" at the Jackson Family Foundation's Forever Michael: A Celebration of an Icon, the one year Michael Jackson memorial show held in 2010 at Beverly Hilton Hotel the home of the Golden Globes in Los Angeles. He took part in Melodi Grand Prix 2017 with the song \\"You & I\\". Biography Early life Son of Inge Valen, who played as a footballer for the team Viking FK, Valen was expected to follow in his father's footsteps to become a sportsman. However, Valen left the sport of football when he was 16 and wound up hosting a popular radio show in his native city of Stavanger, Norway. His quick wit and popular on-air impersonations led Valen to the world of comedy. Comedy Valen has created several successful live shows, including Fart√∏y Valen (Ship Valen), Et Musikalsk Kaos (A Musical Chaos), and Raskere enn sitt eget beste (Faster than His Own Good). The shows have to date netted Valen an estimated US$40 million in ticket sales. His three TV series Valen TV, Valen & De and Valen\`s Frokost TV aired on the national Norwegian broadcaster TV Norge, and topped the ratings. He has been voted \\"Entertainer of the Year\\" by viewers of Norway's TV2 and the \\"√Örets TV-ansikt\\" (\\"This Year's TV-face\\") by the readers of the magazine Se & H√∏r (See & Hear). In October of that year he became the most selling artist in Scandinavia. All three of Valen's TV series also became DVD releases. Valen stated he would have been happy if his first DVD Valen TV sold 5,000 copies; the DVD went on to sell well over 120,000 copies and to win the award for Best DVD overall in 2003. DVD releases of Fart√∏y Valen, Valen & De ,Frokost TV and the Saturday night comedy show \\"Valens Rikskringkasting\\" and Valen's most recent DVD production (of the hit show) Raskere enn sitt eget beste sold 25,000 copies in one day. To date, Valen's DVD sales have reportedly topped 500,000 (he has released six DVDs). In 2013 he wrote,directed and produced his own stage show (\\"From Hillev√•g to Hollywood\\") containing impersonations of both international and Scandinavian singers/artist and celebrities. The show was a hit since day one and was sold out two years ahead of time and 2015 sold out as well. This makes him the most selling artist in Scandinavia of all time with over 700,000 tickets sold. In Autumn 2014 he made a slight change by making his TV show \\"The Valen Channel\\" more of an entertainment show rather just slapstick comedy with only impersonations and characters. (The show featured guests including Sharon Stone, William Shatner, Steven Bauer, Esai Morales as well as duets with noted American artists such as singer/producer Jean Beavour, and Lita Ford - who sang \\"Close My Eyes Forever\\" written with Ozzy Osbourne.) The Lita/\\"Ozzy\\" live duet courted both controversy and praise all over the world, with Ozzy fans expressing anger with Lita Ford for doing this, and for Valen's parody. Music Valen founded his own company Deepwater Records and recorded his debut solo album Listen When Alone in 2004. Produced by Arvid Solvang, the album went gold in five days, and went on to go platinum. The first single from the album, \\"Still Here\\" reached No. 1 on the country's biggest station NRK's P1 and the video for the single ‚Äì which featured a spectacular car crash on the streets of Los Angeles ‚Äì was voted No. 1 by viewers of Norwegian national broadcaster NRK's popular Swish program, and No. 3 by readers of national newspaper Dagbladet. The song was used as the theme music for the German TV series Leben f√ºr die Liebe. Another single from the album \\"If I Was\\" featured controversial fictional depictions of a Norwegian soldier being killed while fighting in a foreign army in the Bosnian War, depictions which were criticised by the Norwegian Armed Forces. Valen's most recent single ‚ÄúBlessed by a Woman‚Äù was released on 15 March 2011, also by Deepwater Records. Valen has signed a worldwide music publishing contract with Air Chrysalis Scandinavia. Recent and current events Valen was asked by Katherine Jackson (Michael's mother) to appear at Forever Michael: A Celebration of an Icon. The show was held to commemorate the one year anniversary of Michael Jackson's death. Held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills (home of the Golden Globe awards), the show also featured performances by Jackson family members Genevieve Jackson and Tito Jackson, as well as Motown legends The Chi Lites. Valen performed his song ‚ÄúStill Here‚Äù and also did a montage of his musical impressions for the event. Valen recently had a cognac brand named after him by the French company Cognac Gautier. Selection Valen Cognac V.S.O.P. is currently sold in Norway, but will also be sold throughout Scandinavia and in selected US markets. Valen released his 6th TV show \\"The Valen Channel\\" which was the first program he wrote, produced and starred along with artists like Sharon Stone, William Shatner, Steven Bauer, Esai Morales, Jean Beavour and Lita Ford. The show was the first entertainment show rather than only comedy like his five earlier TV shows. He wanted to make a TV show that had more of the same vibe as his live shows where the whole experience was more important than to be having the funniest show. The show aired in autumn 2014 and to critical approval and it became a rating hit. (About 700,000+ saw the show every week, in a country with 5 million inhabitants going up against the 9¬¥oclock News.). Legal issues In 2007 police were responded to Valen's Oslo apartment, after he had shot at the shower cabinet in his bathroom with a Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun. Valen opened fire to ward off an apparent intruder he had spotted. When police arrived they confiscated 25 ex-military firearms from Valen's home, which led to him being fined for gun law violations. In September 2016, Valen was sentenced to 25 days in prison for two incidents which took place earlier that year. The first case for which he was convicted, occurred in February 2016, when medical personnel and police were called out to a medical emergency at his apartment. In the aftermath of the incident, Valen had published pictures of the attending police officers on Facebook, along with messages which were found by Oslo District Court to have been of a threatening nature. The other incident which formed part of his conviction, took place in mid-September 2016, when Valen was arrested by police at Aker Brygge in Oslo while dressed in camouflage garb and in possession of a replica firearm. Following his arrests, Valen spent a total of six days in police custody before being released to await trial. He appealed the convictions. In February 2017 it was announced that Valen would have his appeal heard at Borgarting Court of Appeal. In October 2016, Valen stated his intention to emigrate from Norway, citing as reasons what he alleges to be harassment by the Norwegian Police and claiming he has been physically assaulted on the street.

She is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor, Daniel Nathans Professor, and Director of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins University and will be joining the faculty at UC Santa Cruz as a distinguished professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology in October, 2020. Greider discovered the enzyme telomerase in 1984, while she was a graduate student of Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, Berkeley. Greider pioneered research on the structure of telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes. She was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, along with Blackburn and Jack W. Szostak, for their discovery that telomeres are protected from progressive shortening by the enzyme telomerase.  Early life and education  Greider was born in San Diego, California.Hopkins ‚ÄúTelomere‚Äù expert Carol Greider shares Germany's largest science prize Her father, Kenneth Greider, was a physics professor. Her family moved from San Diego to Davis, California, where she spent many of her early years and graduated from Davis Senior High School in 1979. She graduated from the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a B.A. in biology in 1983. During this time she also studied at the University of G√∂ttingen and made significant discoveries there.Press release, University of G√∂ttingen (9 December 2009). (German) Greider is dyslexic and states that her \\"compensatory skills also played a role in my success as a scientist because one has to intuit many different things that are going on at the same time and apply those to a particular problem\\" Greider initially suspected her dyslexia after seeing patterns of common mistakes such as backwards words when she received back graded work in the first grade. Greider started to memorize words and their spellings rather than attempting to sound out the spelling of words. Greider has worked significantly to overcome her dyslexia to become successful in her professional life, and credits her dyslexia as helping her appreciate differences and making unusual decisions such as the one to work with Tetrahymena, an unusual organism. Greider initially had difficulty getting into graduate school due to low GRE scores as a result of her dyslexia. Greider applied to thirteen grad schools and was only accepted to two, Caltech and U.C. Berkeley. She chose Berkeley where she would be able to work with Elizabeth Blackburn and the two made their telomerase discovery.  Discovery of telomerase  She completed her Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1987 at the University of California, Berkeley, under Elizabeth Blackburn. While at UC Berkeley, Greider co-discovered telomerase, a key enzyme in cancer and anemia research, along with Blackburn. Greider joined Blackburn's laboratory in April 1984 looking for the enzyme that was hypothesized to add extra DNA bases to the ends of chromosomes. Without the extra bases, which are added as repeats of a six base pair motif, chromosomes are shortened during DNA replication, eventually resulting in chromosome deterioration and senescence or cancer-causing chromosome fusion. Blackburn and Greider looked for the enzyme in the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila, a fresh-water protozoan with a large number of telomeres. On December 25, 1984, Greider first obtained results indicating that a particular enzyme was likely responsible. After six months of additional research Greider and Blackburn concluded that it was the enzyme responsible for telomere addition. They published their findings in the journal Cell in December, 1985. The enzyme, originally called \\"telomere terminal transferase,\\" is now known as telomerase. Telomerase rebuilds the tips of chromosomes and determines the life span of cells. Greider's additional research to confirm her discovery was largely focused on identifying the mechanism that telomerase uses for elongation. Greider chose to use RNA degrading enzymes and saw that the telomeres stopped extending, which was an indication that RNA was involved in the enzyme.  Subsequent career  Greider then completed her postdoctoral work, and also held a faculty position, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Long Island, New York. Greider continued to study Tetrahymena telomerase, cloning the gene encoding the RNA component and demonstrating that it provided the template for the TTGGGG telomere repeats (1989) as well as establishing that telomerase is processive (1991). She was also able to reconstitute Tetrahymena telomerase in vitro (1994) and define the mechanisms of template utilization (1995). Greider also worked with Calvin Harley to show that telomere shortening underlies cellular senescence (1990). To further test this idea mouse and human telomerase were characterized (1993) (1995) and the mouse telomerase RNA component was cloned (1995). During this time, Greider, in collaboration with Ronald A. DePinho, produced the first telomerase knockout mouse, showing that although telomerase is dispensable for life, increasingly short telomeres result in various deleterious phenotypes, colloquially referred to as premature aging. In the mid-1990s, Greider was recruited by Michael D. West, founder of biotechnology company Geron (now CEO of AgeX Therapeutics) to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board and remained on the Board until 1997. Greider accepted a faculty position at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1997. Greider continued to study telomerase deficient mice and saw that her sixth generation of mice had become entirely sterile, but when mated with control mice the telomerase deficient mice were able to regenerate their telomeres. Greider continued to work on telomerase biochemistry, defining the secondary structure (2000) and template boundary (2003) of vertebrate telomerase RNA as well as analyzing the pseudoknot structure in human telomerase RNA (2005). In addition to working in Tetrahymena and mammalian systems, Greider also studied telomeres and telomerase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, further characterizing the recombination-based gene conversion mechanism that yeast cells null for telomerase use to maintain telomeres (1999) (2001). Greider also showed that short telomeres elicit a DNA damage response in yeast (2003). Greider, Blackburn and Szostak shared the 2006 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their work on telomeres, before jointly receiving the Nobel Prize in 2009. In February 2014, Greider was named a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at Johns Hopkins University. Greider currently serves as director of and professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Greider was first promoted to Daniel Nathans Professor at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2004. Greider's lab employs both student and post-doctoral trainees in order to further examine the relationships between the biology of telomeres and their connection to disease. Greider's lab uses a variety of tools including yeast, mice, and biochemistry in order to look at progressive telomere shortening. Greider's lab is also researching how tumor reformation can be controlled by the presence of short telomeres. The lab's future work will focus more on identifying the processing and regulation of telomeres and telomere elongation.  Personal life  Greider married Nathaniel C. Comfort, a fellow academic, in 1992. She has two children. Greider is divorced.

In its later days it followed the Benedictine order as an influential monastery with many dependencies. History The abbey was founded by Saint Martin of Tours (316-397), in 372, after he had been made Bishop of Tours in 371. Martin's biographer, Sulpicius Severus (c. 363‚Äìc. 425), affirms that Martin withdrew from the press of attention in the city to live in Marmoutier (Majus Monasterium), the monastery he founded several miles from Tours on the opposite shore of the Loire River. Sulpicius described the severe restrictions of the life of Martin among the cave-dwelling cenobites who gathered around him, a rare view of a monastic community that preceded the Benedictine rule: In 853 the abbey was pillaged and destroyed by Normans, who killed over 100 monks. In 982 the abbey, which had fallen into some disorders, was restored by Majolus of Cluny, Abbot of Cluny, at the instance of Eudes I, Count of Blois and of Tours, who died a monk at Marmoutier. During the years shortly after 1000 AD, the abbey grew considerably, becoming one of the richest in Europe.Goyau, Georges. \\"Archdiocese of Tours.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 24 June 2019 In the wake of the Norman Conquest the abbey acquired patronage of churches in England. In 1096 Pope Urban II consecrated its new chapel, and preached the First Crusade. Pope Calixtus II preached crusade again in 1119, convincing Count Foulques V d'Anjou to take part and leading to his subsequent role as King of Jerusalem. In 1162 Pope Alexander III, who came to reside in Tours after being chased from Rome by Frederick Barbarossa, consecrated the monastery's new Chapel Saint Benoit. The abbey eventually grew too small for its inhabitants, and was completely rebuilt at the start of the thirteenth century under the leadership of Abbot Hugues des Roches. Work was periodically interrupted by violent attacks made by the counts of Blois on the monks of Marmoutier. In 1253 Louis IX took the abbey under his protection. In the following century its abbot G√©rard du Puy became cardinal-nephew to the last of the Avignon popes, Gregory XI. In 1562 the abbey was again pillaged, this time by Huguenot Protestants at the start of the Wars of Religion. Again however it recovered. English diarist John Evelyn visited the abbey, and recorded this entry for June 6, 1644: The abbey was disestablished in 1799 during the French Revolution, and within a few decades the bulk of its buildings had been demolished. American writer Henry James visited the abbey in 1883, being guided through the various buildings by \\"a chatty nun\\", as described in his book A Little Tour in France. Today its grounds contain a catholic private school. References Sources * Sulpitius Severus On the Life of St. Martin. Translation and Notes by Alexander Roberts.

He played for various clubs in France, England, Scotland, and Greece. He represented French Guiana at the 2012 Caribbean Cup. Career Early career Darcheville was born in Sinnamary, French Guiana. He began his professional career in France at Rennes. He played his first game for Rennes in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Monaco in 1995. He spent three seasons at Rennes, scoring five goals in 42 matches. He then joined English Premier League club Nottingham Forest on loan for a season but failed to settle, scoring only two goals in 16 matches. He was still coming to terms with the death of his wife and children in a car accident in 1998. Return to France After a disappointing season in England, Darcheville decided to continue his career in France and joined Lorient. He spent three seasons with Lorient, scoring 44 goals in 102 matches, including the winning goal in the Coupe de France as Lorient beat Bastia 1‚Äì0. He was also on the losing side in the Coupe de la Ligue final as Lorient lost 3‚Äì0 to Bordeaux. When Lorient were relegated from the top-flight Ligue 1, Darcheville joined Bordeaux. During the previous season, he had scored 19 goals in 32 matches for the doomed Lorient and his good form continued for Bordeaux, where he scored 11 league goals in his first season. Overall, he scored 37 goals in 131 league games and netted seven goals in European competition. Rangers Darcheville signed a two-year contract with Scottish side Rangers on 9 May 2007 to join the club on 1 July. He was signed by Walter Smith, after Rangers' two previous managers, Alex McLeish and Paul Le Guen, were also linked with him. Darcheville made his Rangers debut against Montenegrin side Zeta on 31 July 2007, in a 2‚Äì0 victory. He then went on to score his first and second goals for the club in a match against Falkirk on 18 August 2007. On 12 December 2007, in Rangers' final \\"make-or-break\\" 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Champions League match against Lyon, Darcheville missed an open goal from five yards out and was later sent off for stamping on Kim K√§llstr√∂m. He later received a three match suspension for this offence and missed the UEFA Cup third round tie against Panathinaikos (Rangers would eventually go through to the next round on the away goals rule after drawing 1‚Äì1 in Athens) and was also unavailable for the first leg of the last-16 clash with German side Werder Bremen. Darcheville did, however, score away from home in the next round against Sporting CP, and helped Rangers defeat Fiorentina to reach the final against Zenit Saint Petersburg. Rangers lost the final 2‚Äì0; the game was Darcheville's only full match for the club. Darcheville scored his first goal of the 2008‚Äì09 season, and his first in six months for Rangers, against Aberdeen on 22 November in a 2‚Äì0 win at Ibrox. This was to prove to be his last goal for the Ibrox club. Later career Darcheville left Rangers on 1 January 2009 to join Valenciennes in France.\\"Darcheville Ibrox exit confirmed\\" BBC Sport. 19 December 2008.

Still, in spite of this small distance, motor launches had to be specially hired to reach the island until the opening of Coney Island Park, linked to the main island by two bridges on its western and eastern ends. History Formerly known as Pulau Serangoon (English: Serangoon Island), the island was once owned by entrepreneur siblings Haw Boon Aw and Aw Boon Par, before being sold to an Indian businessman, Ghulam Mahmood, in 1950 with the intention of turning the island into a resort modelled after the amusement park at Coney Island, New York.

Further land reclamation works were carried out during the 1990s with plans to build a 50-hectare park together with the development of Punggol New Town. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said that under the Master Plan, a part of Coney Island was zoned for residential, sport and recreational use but as the land is not immediately required for development, a part of Coney Island would be kept as an interim park for the time being. The rest of the island was zoned for park use. On 10 October 2015, Coney Island Park opened to the public, with a beach stretching and a long path that is part of the park connector network. The offshore island of Pulau Serangoon (Coney Island), was formerly part of the Changi SMC from 1951 to 1997, then subsumed into East Coast GRC (Siglap division) from 1997 to 2015 before transferring to Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC after the growth of Punggol. Activities and facilities Coney Island is also a popular place for jet skiing and camping. However, this has contributed to the beaches being polluted by litter such as discarded cans, instant noodle packets and bottles. Coney Island Park Managed by the National Parks Board, the nature park is home to a wide variety of habitats, including coastal forests, grasslands and mangroves. The park was officially opened by the Transport Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for Infrastructure, Khaw Boon Wan on 10 October 2015. During its first year of operation, a free- ranging Brahman cow was frequently sighted in the area.

Often the subsequent shooters will not know why they are firing, unless they are infantrymen, in which case they are expected to do so. For instance, if someone was a member of a fire team following the point man and he suddenly begins firing his weapon, there is a good chance that their element is in contact with the enemy. Prerequisites for a sworn peace officer regarding the discharge of a duty weapon are in no way comparable to those of a military unit engaged in a firefight. While commonly accepted in popular culture and police jargon, there has been yet no scientific evidence \\"to prove the existence of a contagious shooting dynamic\\", which O'Donnell said was a \\"debatable notion\\". Additionally, a former CIA employee and FBI firearms instructor observed it in training. \\"Consistently, in every class, officers would shoot at their target upon hearing others shoot, even when their particular target board did not contain the called target.\\" He suggests that one reason it occurs is because of muscle memory: \\"[T]he targets turn or the whistle blows, and all the officers shoot together until a cease fire signal is given.\\" O'Donnell partially reinforces this, saying that in classic cases involving contagious shooting, \\"a gun was shot before any officers fired\\", and thus \\"the officers involved began shooting because of fear or because of the sound of a colleague firing\\". Examples *2013: In California, officers involved in the search for Christopher Dorner mistakenly fired at least 100 rounds at a truck occupied by three people, none of whom had any connection to the suspect.

He is revered as a saint in the Catholic Church. His feast day is 20 December. Life Born in Ca√±as, La Rioja, to a family of peasants, he worked as a shepherd before becoming a Benedictine monk at the Monasteries of San Mill√°n de la Cogolla. He was ordained a priest and soon became master of novices and then prior, before being driven out with two of his fellow monks by King Garc√≠a S√°nchez III of Navarre, for opposing his intention to annex the monastery's lands. Under the protection of King Ferdinand I of Le√≥n, in 1041 they found refuge in the town of Silos at the decaying Abbey of St. Sebastian, occupied by only six monks. (After his death, both the monastery and the town were renamed for him.) Dominic was appointed as the abbot of the community and, inspired by the reforms of Cluny, proceeded to rebuild the monastery, both spiritually and physically. He built the cloisters in the Romanesque style, and established a scriptorium, turning the monastery into a center of book design, scholarship, and significant charity made possible through the proceeds of the gold and silver workshop. Dominic became known for works of healing. The monastery became one of the centers of the Mozarabic liturgy, and also preserved the Visigothic script of ancient Spain. Stevens, Clifford. The One Year Book of Saints, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division, Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., Huntington, Indiana Wealthy patrons endowed the monastery, and Dominic raised funds to ransom Christians taken prisoner by the Moors. By the time of his death, on 20 December 1073, the monastery numbered forty monks. Ferdinand welcomes Domingo de Silos by Mart√≠n Bernat and Bartolom√© Bermejo, 1477-79 Veneration Dominic's relics were translated to the monastery church on 5 January 1076. Churches and monasteries were dedicated to him as early as 1085. His annual feast day is celebrated on 20 December. Patronage The mother of the better-known Saint Dominic of Guzm√°n, the Blessed Joan of Aza, is said to have prayed at his shrine before she was able to conceive the son she named for him. That son would grow up to found the Dominican Order. Dominic's special patronage thus became connected with pregnancy, and until the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931, his abbatial crozier was used to bless the queens of Spain, and was placed by their beds when they were in labor. St. Dominic of Silos is patron saint of prisoners, pregnant women, and shepherds. Legacy The noted 13th-century priest and poet, Gonzalo de Berceo, wrote an account of his life. In the 19th century Silos became a monastery in the Benedictine Congregation of Solesmes, and is notable for its fine double Romanesque cloisters, extensive library, and recordings of Gregorian Chant.

The massive walls of Amantia were built before the end of the 4th century, and literary sources report them as an Illyrian rather than Epirote or Macedonian foundation. Later Amantia acquired the trappings of a Hellenistic town. In terms of fortifications, masonry and general architecture, language and religion Amantia shares the same features as the rest of the settlement of the Greek world of that time. It occupied an important defensive position above the Vjosa river valley to the east, and on the road to the coast and the Bay of Aulon. A temple dedicated to Aphrodite, a theatre, and a stadium have also been found in the city.Anamali S. Amantie. Iliria 2 (1972), pp. 67-148. The name for an inhabitant was Amantieus (). It has been described as a \\"Greek city\\" by historians Hammond N.G.L. and Fanula Papazoglou. Some Albanian historians consider it as an Illyrian settlement, nevertheless in terms of language, institutions, officials, onomastics, city- planning and fortifications Amantia displays the typical features of a Greek city. Name It has been suggested that the root morpheme *Amant- was perhaps a \\"barbarized\\" version of *Abant- in relation to the Abantes. The name Amantia is generally accepted as Illyrian. Pseudo-Skylax (Periplus. 26) and Lycophron (Alexandra. 1043) recorded the toponym ·ºàŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒ±, Amantia. The Delphic list of theorodokoi reported the form ·ºàŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒ±, Abantia. The city-ethnic is recorded as ·ºàŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒπŒµœçœÇ, Amantieus by Pseudo Skylax (27). History According to Pausanias, the settlement was founded by Locrians from nearby Thronium and Abantes from Euboea.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 5.22.3-5.22.4. Stephanus Byzantius - based on Pausanias - mentions Amantia as located in Illyria, though it was originally founded by the Euboean Abantes \\"returning from the Trojan war\\".Amantia: Illyrion moira, plesion Orikou kai Kerkuras eks Abanton apo Troias nostesanton oikismene.

Proxenos in 3rd century B.C considers them Epirotes, while Pliny the Elder calls them barbarians.Hatzopoulos, 1997, p. 143 The massive walls of Amantia were built before the end of the 4th century, and literary sources report them as an Illyrian rather than Epirote or Macedonian foundation. Later Amantia acquired the trappings of a Hellenistic town. The temple of Aphrodite in Amantia is an example of the Hellenistic influence in present-day Albania via contact with the nearby Greek colonies. Its name was mentioned for the first time in the 4th century BC. It is situated on the slope of a high hill and had only its acropolis fortified. By the 3rd century BC, the town was strengthened economically and minted its own coins. The town became part of the Roman province of Epirus Novus. Eulalius, one of the Eastern bishops at the Council of Sardica who refused to recognize its right to revoke the condemnation of Athanasius of Alexandria and withdrew in a body to Philippopolis, was probably bishop of this town, but some think he was bishop of Amasea.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 250-251Daniele Farlati-Jacopo Coleti, Illyricum Sacrum, vol.

Tama was named after the Tama River in Kant≈ç region of Japan. Background After the construction of the , the demerits of the small cruiser concept became apparent. At the end of 1917, plans for an additional six Tenry≈´-class vessels, plus three new-design 7,200 ton-class scouting cruisers were shelved, in favor of an intermediate 5,500 ton-class vessel which could be used as both a long-range, high speed scout ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer or submarine flotillas.Gardner, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906‚Äì1921; page 238 Design The Kuma-class vessels were essentially enlarged versions of the Tenry≈´-class cruisers, with greater speed, range, and weaponry. With improvements in geared-turbine engine technology, the Kuma-class vessels were capable of the high speed of , and a range of at . The number of 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns was increased from three on the Tenry≈´ class to seven on the Kuma class and provision was made for 48 naval mines. However, the two triple torpedo launchers on the Tenry≈´ class was reduced to two double launchers, and the Kuma class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns. Service record Early career Tama was completed at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagasaki shipyard on 29 January 1921. Immediately after commissioning, Tama was assigned to cover the landings of Japanese troops in Siberia during Japan's Siberian Intervention against the Bolshevik Red Army. CombinedFleet.com: Tama Tabular Record of Movement; In 1925, Tama was tasked with making a diplomatic voyage to San Pedro in the United States, to return the remains of US Ambassador to Japan, Edgar Bancroft, who had died in Tokyo.Tate, Transpacific Steam; page 215 In 1932, with the Manchurian Incident, Tama was assigned to patrol the northern coasts of China, from its base in Taiwan. As the war in China continued to escalate, Tama was involved in operations to cover the landings of Japanese troops in central China. On 10 January 1935, the German naval attach√© in Tokyo, Captain Paul Wenneker was invited by Admiral Nobumasa Suetsugu to tour Tama, battleship and submarine at Yokosuka Naval District. Wenneker was reportedly unimpressed with Japanese naval artillery, and advocated increased use of submarine warfare. Northern operations On 10 September 1941, Tama became flagship of Vice Admiral Boshir≈ç Hosogaya's CruDiv 21 with the light cruiser , in the IJN 5th Fleet. Tama and Kiso were sent north to Hokkaid≈ç, in Arctic white camouflage on 2 December, and were patrolling in the Kurile Islands, at the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Both cruisers' hulls were damaged by severe weather, and both were forced to return to dry dock at Yokosuka by the end of the year. On 21 January 1942, CruDiv 21 departed Yokosuka and was again sent north on patrols around Hokkaid≈ç, but was recalled after 38 aircraft of Task Force 16 () made a dawn raid on Marcus Island on 5 March. Tama was assigned to the IJN 1st Fleet with battleships and , and sortied from Hashirajima to search for Admiral William F Halsey, but failed to locate his forces after several weeks of searching. On 5 April, CruDiv 21 returned to northern waters, but on 18 April the Doolittle Raid struck targets in Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya and Kobe. Tama was again recalled to join in another unsuccessful pursuit of Halsey. For the rest of April and most of May, Tama resumed its northern patrols. On 28 May, Tama departed Mutsu Bay to participate in the \\"Operation AL\\" (the seizure of Attu and Kiska) in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands. After successfully landing forces to seize the islands, CruDiv 21 returned to Mutsu Bay on 23 June. However, Tama was quickly sent back to cover the second reinforcement convoy to Kiska, then patrolled southwest of Kiska in anticipation of an American counter-attack until 2 August. After a brief return to Yokosuka for maintenance, Tama covered the transfer of the Attu garrison to Kiska. On 25 October, CruDiv 21 embarked further reinforcements at Kashiwabara, Paramushiro to Attu. Tama continued to patrol the Aleutians and the Kurile islands and around Hokkaid≈ç until 6 January 1943, making another supply run to Kiska in November. After refit at Yokosuka in early February 1943, Tama again patrolled north from ≈åminato Guard District to Kataoka (Simushir island), to Kashiwabara (Paramushiro) to 7 March. Another major supply run to Attu was made from 7‚Äì13 March. On 23 March, Tama departed Paramushiro towards Attu with Vice Admiral Hosogaya's IJN Fifth Fleet cruisers and , light cruiser and destroyers , , , and escorting a three-ship reinforcement carrying troops and supplies for the garrison on Attu. At the Battle of the Komandorski Islands on 26 March, against USN Task Group 16.6 with the light cruiser , heavy cruiser and four destroyers, in a four-hour running gun and torpedo battle, Salt Lake City and destroyer were damaged by gunfire. The other destroyers were not damaged. During the battle, Tama fired 136 shells and four torpedoes, and received two hits in return, which damaged her catapult and wounding one crewman,Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45, page 19; however Nachi was hit several times; and the Japanese aborted the resupply mission, returning to Paramushiro on 28 March. Disgraced by retreating from an inferior force, Hosogaya was relieved of command and forced to retire. Vice Admiral Shiro Kawase assumed command of the Fifth Fleet.Dull, A Battle History of the Imperial Japanese Navy Tama remained on guard duty at Kataoka for over a month and then was sent to Maizuru Naval Arsenal for a refit on 4 May. She was thus absent during the \\"American Operation Landcrab\\" to retake the Aleutian Islands, and during Japanese evacuation of Kiska on 19 May. Returning to Kataoka only on 23 May, Tama resumed guard duties until 5 July. During \\"Operation Ke-Go\\" (the evacuation of Kiska) on 7 July, Tamas engines were considered too unreliable for her to participate directly in the evacuation, and she remained behind at Paramushiro. In any event, the mission was aborted due to weather. Tama remained on guard duty in the Kuriles until 30 August. Operations in southern waters After a refit at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, Tama was sent south with troops and supplies for Ponape, Caroline Islands on 15 September. After stopping by Truk, and returning to Kure, Tama was ordered to Shanghai on 11 October, to ferry additional troops to Truk and Rabaul, New Britain. After disembarking the reinforcements at Rabaul, she was attacked by RAAF Bristol Beaufort bombers from Guadalcanal on 21 October. Tamas hull plates were damaged by near-misses and she was forced return to Rabaul for emergency repairs. On 27 October, Tama returned to Yokosuka for a major refit; her Nos. 5 and No.7 140-mm guns were removed along with her aircraft catapult and derrick. A twin 127-mm HA gun was fitted, as were four triple mount and six single mount Type 96 25-mm AA guns. This brought Tamas total number of 25-mm guns to 22 barrels (4x3, 2x2, 6x1). A type 21 air search radar was also fitted. Repairs and modifications were completed on 9 December. Tama departed Yokosuka on 24 December, again for northern waters, and remained on patrol until 19 June 1944. Returning to Yokosuka by 22 June, Tama then began operations to ferry Imperial Japanese Army reinforcements to the Ogasawara islands, making two runs to 12 August. On 30 August, Tama was transferred from CruDiv 21, Fifth Fleet to become flagship of DesRon 11, Combined Fleet, replacing the lost . Battle of Leyte Gulf During the Battle of Leyte Gulf (20 October 1944), Tama was assigned to Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa Northern Mobile (\\"Decoy\\") Force.

It explores the boundary between the conscious and subconscious mind. The Coma was published in 2004, eight years after Garland's first novel, The Beach. Plot summary While traveling home on an underground train, Carl is forced to defend a young girl from the harassment of a group of men. For his efforts, Carl is violently attacked and falls into a coma. When he awakes, he quickly discovers that his seemingly normal world is very peculiar. Critical reception Scott Tobias, writing for the A.V. Club, said, \\"The Coma lacks the gravity of ideas, which leaves the narrative to drift along in the blinkered consciousness of a pot haze.\\" Tim Adams, writing for the Guardian, said, \\"Garland is very good at recreating the virtual worlds of the half-awake and then subtly dissolving them.\\" A reviewer for Bookslut said, \\"Initially, some of Garland‚Äôs motifs and literary devices seemed too elaborate and obscure; yet on a second read they disentangle and shine.\\" Scott Lamb, writing for Salon, said, ‚ÄúThe Coma is essentially a story composed of a single arc, and this formal tic may, for some, be its big weakness ... What the book lacks in plot twists, though, it makes up for in atmosphere and tone.\\" Adaptations In 2006, The Coma was adapted into a play by a writer called Marcus Condron, and then was performed by a theatre group called 'We Could Be Kings'. The play made heavy use of projected video content to help express the thoughts of Carl, and original music was composed for the piece by Alex Cornish.

He got his breakthrough with Danish club FC Nordsj√¶lland in 2004, before moving to Swedish club IFK G√∂teborg, with whom he won the 2008 Swedish Cup. He joined F.C. Copenhagen in June 2010. He played one game for the Danish national team. Club career Born in Fredericia, Christensen started playing football with amateur team Rosenh√∏j, and represented the team for 101 games.http://www.rosenhojboldklub.dk/viewpage.php?page_id=81 He joined Danish 1st Division team Hvidovre IF in 2002, and played one season with the club as it was relegated during the 2002‚Äì03 season. He moved to newly promoted 1st Division team Nyk√∏bing Falster Alliancen, and helped the team finish eighth in the 2003‚Äì04 season. FC Nordsj√¶lland He joined Danish Superliga club FC Nordsj√¶lland in 2004, competing with Japanese international Yoshi Kawaguchi for the starting position. While Kawaguchi was away to play for the Japanese national team during the pre-season, Christensen established himself as the starting goalkeeper. He played all 33 league games as Nordsj√¶lland finished in 10th place in the 2004‚Äì05 season, and also saw off the competition from backup keeper Jan Budtz. He also played all games of the following 2004‚Äì05 season, as the team finished ninth. When Tommy Olsen rescinded his place as team captain in May 2006, Christensen was chosen the next captain of Nordsj√¶lland. In an April 2007 game against F.C. Copenhagen, Christensen made an uncharacteristic mistake as Nordsj√¶lland lost 0‚Äì1, when he mistimed a kick of the ball, leaving it rolling into the empty net. He still played all Nordsj√¶lland games of the 2006‚Äì07 season, helping the club finish fifth. In November 2007, Christensen expressed the wish to move abroad, in order to be in contention for a place in the Danish national team. He looked to leave the club during the winter transfer window, after a total 117 league games in a row for FC Nordsj√¶lland. IFK G√∂teborg Christensen transferred to IFK G√∂teborg on 13 March 2008, as a replacement for club legend Bengt Andersson, who had retired after the previous season. He made his debut on 22 March in the Swedish Super Cup final against Kalmar FF. IFK G√∂teborg won 3‚Äì1 to secure the 2008 Swedish Super Cup trophy. Christensen kept the number 1 spot for the entire 2008 season, playing every single minute in the league and was widely praised for his performances. Towards the end of the season, Christensen kept his opponents from scoring in six straight games, among others in the away game against the eventual champions Kalmar FF. On 21 September 2008, Christensen won his second title with the club when Kalmar FF were defeated in the 2008 Swedish Cup final on penalty shootout, after drawing the game 0‚Äì0. Christensen himself was hailed as a hero, making several impressive saves during the game and also scoring in the penalty shootout. In a match on 23 September 2009 against √ñrebro it was discovered that, prior to the match start, Christensen lifted and moved both goal posts inwards, thus making his goal smaller. 20 minutes into the game, the referee was notified of the infraction and corrected the positions of the goal posts. When interviewed after the game, Christensen said he had done so before on many occasions and perhaps that was the reason he was able to keep goals out. F.C. Copenhagen In June 2010, he moved back to Denmark, as he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with defending Superliga champions F.C.

Mercur Mine in background. Plaque in front of the Mercur cemetery Mercur is a historical hard rock mining ghost town in Tooele County, Utah, USA. In 1891, it became the site of the first successful use of the cyanide process of gold extraction in the United States, the dominant metallurgy today. Its elevation from sea level is approximately 2,042 m. The nearby Mercur Gold Mine was re-opened by Barrick Gold in 1985, with mining operations again coming to an end in 1997. The reclamation and restoration project was set to continue up to 2010. History The town first came into being in 1870 as Lewiston (not to be confused with the present-day city of Lewiston in Cache County), when gold was discovered at the head of the Lewiston Canyon, six miles west of present-day Cedar Fort. A small gold rush began, peaking about 1873; the population reached as high as 2000. During the mid-1870s, silver boomed, and silver mines were opened and quartz mills to process the ore were built. A million dollars worth of silver bullion was shipped down the valley, but the ore quickly gave out, and Lewiston became a ghost town by 1880. In 1879, a Bavarian miner named Arie Pinedo had discovered a deposit of cinnabar in the area. The ore contained gold as well as mercury, but contemporary processes were unable to extract it. Similar discoveries were made throughout the 1880s. In 1890, a group of Nebraska \\"farmers\\" bought the Mercur claim through an over optimistic promoter. They opened the mine and put in a basic amalgamation mill, a grand flop. Mercur ores were not workable with the ancient process. One of the Nebraska partners, Gilbert S. \\"Gill\\" Peyton, a former druggist, heard of the new but unperfected cyanide process and gave it a try. Fearful of losing his and his relatives investment, he solved the difficulties of the new method on the ores, and by December 1891 proved that the cyanide process worked ‚Äì the first such successful operation in the United States. (The cyanide process has come to dominate western gold metallurgy.) As a result, Peyton and his brother-in-law, partner Hal Brown became rich, as did others of the Nebraska group, including company president John Dern, a Fremont, Nebraska grain dealer soon-to-be Salt Lake City business leader. (Brown's niece married Dern's son George, who became a manager of Mercur Con, a successful mining engineer, and Utah governor, 1925-1933; he then served as Secretary of War under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 1933-1936). McIntyre Mansion (Peyton Hall), listed on the National Register of Historic Places The advent of the cyanide process started the gold rush all over again. Gold was extracted not only from newly mined ore, but from old tailings as well. Soon, there were enough people to build a new town on the old site, but the name of Lewiston was already taken by then. The citizens settled on the name Mercur, from the Nebraska company's name, which in turn came from the name of Pinedo's claim. A branch railroad was built in the fall and winter of 1894. A dozen mining operations worked the area's ores with the largest being the Golden Gate Mining Company, which operated the largest cyanide mill in the U. S. in 1898-1902 (A young Daniel C. Jackling, of later Bingham Canyon fame, designed the structure which is visible in photos above the town). In 1902, Joseph DeLamar sold the Golden Gate operation to the Derns and partners, who formed the Mercur Consolidated. Gill Peyton and Hal Brown had sold out by then. Brown became a Utah banker and promoter of horse racing while Peyton began working mines across the country and in Mexico. He left Salt Lake City, where he sold his Greek revival mansion, Peyton Hall, now known as the McIntyre Mansion, and died in California in 1930, looking for a second Mercur mine bonanza. Amongst the miners were many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There was, however, no organization of the church in Mercur until 1896 when a branch was organized with Charles B. Felt as president. In 1899, Moses W. Reynolds, James Duckworth and Sidney S. Reynolds were sent to the town as missionaries. Their success in both bringing church members out and possibly having some convert baptisms led to the organization of a ward in Mercur on July 1, 1900 with George W. Bryan as bishop.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Publishing Company, 1941) p. 489 In 1902, a fire that started in the business district of the town burned almost the entire city to the ground. The town was rebuilt and mining resumed again. In its heyday, there were about 5,000 residents of Mercur. Mercur supported a large Italian immigrant community; young men were attracted by the opportunity of high wages and the romance of the American \\"wild west\\". With this Italian influence, Columbus Day became an important city event including parades, games and performances by the Mercur City Band. The ward was discontinued in 1913 because the mines had closed and the majority of the population had moved away. By 1916, there was only one building left in Mercur, and by 1930 it was gone.

Chess ran on Control Data Corporation's line of supercomputers. Work on the program began in 1968. It dominated the first computer chess tournaments, such as the World Computer Chess Championship and ACM's North American Computer Chess Championship. Chess was the first published use of the bitboard data structure applied to the game of chess. In 1976, Chess 4.5 won the Class B section of the Paul Masson American Chess Championship, the first time a computer was successful in a human tournament. The performance rating was 1950. In February 1977 Chess 4.6, the only computer entry, surprised observers by winning the 84th Minnesota Open against competitors just under Master level. It achieved a USCF rating close to or at Expert, higher than previous programs' Class C or D, by winning five games and losing none. Stenberg (rated 1969) became the second Class A player to lose to a computer in a tournament game, the first being Jola. Because of its Minnesota victory, grandmaster Walter Browne invited Chess 4.6 on a CDC Cyber 176 to his simultaneous chess exhibition; to Browne and others' surprise, Chess 4.6 defeated the United States chess champion. Also in 1977, Chess 4.6 won the second World Computer Chess Championship in Toronto, ahead of 15 other programs including KAISSA; Chess 4 had finished in second place to KAISSA at the first tournament in 1974. The favorite to win the tournament, like all but one other entry Chess 4.6 ran on a computer located away from the tournament; despite losing 90 minutes to hardware failure at the start of its first match the program rapidly defeated its opponent in 27 moves, earlier than any other first-round match. Chess 4.6 was capable of defeating 99.5% of United States Chess Federation-rated players under tournament conditions, and was stronger in blitz chess. In 1978 and 1979 Atkin and Peter W. Frey published in BYTE a series on computer chess programming, including the Pascal source for Chess 0.5, a chess engine suitable for microcomputers. That year the improved Chess 4.7‚Äîwhich had by now achieved a 2030 rating after 31 tournament games‚Äîplayed against David Levy who, in 1968 had wagered that he would not be beaten by a computer within ten years. Whereas Chess 4.7 had beaten Levy under blitz conditions, the bet involved forty moves over a two- hour period, the computer's choices being relayed by telephone from Minnesota to the board.Mather, Ian, The great computer chess bet, The Observer 20 August 1978 Levy won the bet, defeating the Chess 4.7 in a six-game match by a score of 4.5-1.5,David Levy, \\"Man Beats Machine!\\", Chess Life & Review, November 1978, pp. 600-03, at pp. 601-03.David Levy and Monroe Newborn, More Chess and Computers: The Microcomputer Revolution, The Challenge Match, Computer Science Press, Potomac, Maryland, and Batsford, London, 1980, pp. 10-30. .

Each couple came out one at a time, then each panelist asked the couple in control questions for an unlimited amount of time. When all the couples were grilled then the panel voted on which couple's story was true. Each incorrect vote was worth $500 to the couples, later reduced to $250 per incorrect vote, and fooling the panel completely won the real couple a big trip.

Photo by Edward CurtisWasco-Wishram are two closely related Chinook Indian tribes from the Columbia River in Oregon. Today the tribes are part of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs living in the Warm Springs Indian Reservation in Oregon and Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation living in the Yakama Indian Reservation in Washington.Pritzer, Barry M. A Native American Encyclopedia: History, Culture, and Peoples. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000: 286-7. (retrieved through Google Books, 9 April 2009) History The Wishram and Wasco are Plateau tribes that are closely related and share many cultural aspects of the Northwest Coast tribes. They lived along the banks of the Columbia River, near The Dalles. The Dalles were a prime trading location, and the tribes benefited from a vast trade network. Unfortunately, the 1800s brought non-Indians and European diseases, which took a great toll on the Wasco and Wishram populations. Both tribes were forced by the United States in 1855 to sign treaties ceding the majority of their lands. These treaties established the Warm Springs Reservation. Wasco Wasco comes from the word Wacq!√≥, meaning \\"cup\\" or \\"small bowl,\\" the name of a distinctive bowl-shaped rock near the tribe's primary historic village. They traditionally lived on the south bank of the Columbia River. In 1822, their population was estimated to be 900.Wasco Indian History. Access Genealogy: Indian Tribal Records. (retrieved 9 April 2009) They were divided into three subtribes: the Dalles Wasco or Wasco proper (a.k.a. the Ki-gal-twal-la on the south side of the Columbia River near The Dalles in Wasco County), the Hood River Wasco (on the Hood River or Dog River to its mouth into the Columbia River; Lewis and Clark grouped them with the White Salmon River Band and named them Smock-Shop Band of Chil-luck-kit-te-quaw, but they were two separate groups: White Salmon River Band in Washington and Hood River Band in Oregon, called Ninuhltidih (Curtis) or Kwikwulit (Mooney) and the Cascades Indians or Watlala (downstream from the other Wasco groups, two groups, one on each side of the Columbia River; the Oregon group were called Gahlawaihih [Curtis]). The Watlala, whose dialect is the most divergent dialect of the Wasco, may have been a separate tribe though identified as Wasco since 1830. Wishram Wishram petroglyphs on the Columbia River The Wishram are known as the Tlakluit and Echeloot. They traditionally settled in permanent villages along the north banks of the Columbia River. In the 1700s, the estimated Wishram population was 1,500. In 1962 only 10 Wishrams were counted on the Washington census. Fishing rights The 1855 treaties signed by the Wasco-Wishram provide for the tribes to fish \\"at all ... usual and accustomed stations in common with the citizens of the United States...\\" Between 1938 and 1956, the Bonneville Dam, Grand Coulee Dam, and The Dalles Dam all wreaked havoc upon native fisheries. The government paid money to the tribes to compensate the loss of fish; however, that provided no compensation for the cultural and religious importance that fishing for salmon and steelhead held for the tribe. In 1974 a landmark court case confirmed the rights of Northwest Coast tribes to fish as they have historically done. Today The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs of Oregon have 4,000 enrolled tribal members that are Wasco, Walla Walla, Tenino (Warm Springs), and Paiute.The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon. (retrieved 9 April 2009) 200 of these 4,000 are estimated to be Wasco. Wishram are predominantly enrolled in the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation in Washington state. Language The Wasco-Wishram language is part of the Upper Chinookan or Kiksht division of the Chinookan language family, itself a branch of the proposed Penutian language family.

He spent most of his career in Spain after starting out at Nacional, going on to acquire Spanish citizenship. He amassed La Liga totals of 129 matches and 21 goals over seven seasons, representing Getafe and Espanyol in the competition. Other than in his country and Spain, Alb√≠n also played professionally in Romania, Mexico and Cyprus. Club career Early years Born in Salto, Salto Department, Alb√≠n started his career at Club Nacional de Football, where he won two national championships. His strong performances earned him a transfer to Spanish team Getafe CF during the 2006 summer transfer window. Getafe In his first season, Alb√≠n appeared sparingly (13 La Liga games), but blossomed as first-choice in the following campaign as the Madrid outskirts team reached the quarterfinals in the UEFA Cup, and a mid-table league position. After a coaching change brought M√≠chel to the club's bench, however, he began appearing less regularly; on 29 November 2008, in a rare start, he scored in a 3‚Äì1 home win over Real Madrid. On 21 April 2009, also against Real Madrid, Alb√≠n was struck in the face by Pepe, in the m√™l√©e which resulted after the Portuguese's aggression on Javier Casquero. He continued being used intermittently in the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, netting a last-minute winner at home against Villarreal CF on 11 December 2010 but also being sent off for lifting his shirt, in a second bookable offense. Espanyol In mid-April 2011, Getafe agreed to sell Alb√≠n to fellow league side RCD Espanyol for ‚Ç¨3 million, as his contract was set to expire in June 2012. He spent several months of his first season on the sidelines, nursing a leg injury. On 4 February 2012, Alb√≠n scored his first goal for the Catalans, netting in the 92nd minute for a 3‚Äì3 away draw against Athletic Bilbao. Late career On 6 September 2013, Alb√≠n signed a one-year contract with FC Petrolul Ploie»ôti in Romania, rejoining former Getafe teammate Cosmin Contra who was now a head coach. He made his debut in Liga I on the 21st, scoring his team's only goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw at FC Dinamo Bucure»ôti. Although Alb√≠n admitted that Contra played a big role in his transfer at Petrolul, on 31 March 2014 he chose to extend his link by one year, even if at that time the coach had already left. He ended the campaign with 28 matches and ten goals, all competitions comprised. On 28 August 2014, Alb√≠n scored a goal against GNK Dinamo Zagreb in the second leg of the Europa League play-off round. However, his team lost 2‚Äì5 on aggregate and failed to progress to the group stage. On 16 December 2014, as Petrolul faced financial issues which led to insolvency and later bankruptcy, Alb√≠n was transferred to Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz of Mexico. He returned to Romania and its top division nearly three years later, joining Dinamo Bucure»ôti on a season-long loan with an option to buy in June 2018. On 18 July 2018, 32-year- old Alb√≠n joined Cypriot First Division club AC Omonia. International career Alb√≠n represented Uruguay at under-17 and under-20 level. Style of play Alb√≠n, who is predominantly left-footed, primarily plays as an attacking midfielder, but can also be deployed as a winger. He was described as a footballer with \\"great speed and a very good technique\\" and, during his first spell in Romania, was regarded as one of the best free kick takers in the competition. Adrian Mutu, who played with him at Petrolul, regarded Alb√≠n in 2016 as the best foreigner that the Romanian championship ever had.

He is the pilot of the primary vehicle of the Thunderbird fleet, Thunderbird 1. His specialist training is as a First Responder and Team Leader. Thunderbirds 1965‚Äì66 Character biography The eldest son of Jeff Tracy (founder and financier of International Rescue), Scott is named after American astronaut Scott Carpenter. Sources vary in the canon of the Thunderbirds series as to Scott's age and birth date. One written source suggests that Scott was born on 4 April 2000 or 2039, making him 26 years old. Educated at Yale and Oxford Universities, Scott was decorated for valour during his service with the United States Air Force before taking up his duties with International Rescue. As pilot of the quick response craft Thunderbird 1, he is usually first at the danger zone and typically serves as field commander on all rescue operations. He also takes on secondary duties as co-pilot of the spacecraft Thunderbird 3, is an occasional relief occupant of the Thunderbird 5 space station, and leads the organisation from Tracy Island when his father is absent. Of the five Tracy brothers, it is Scott who keeps a cool head, and who is quick-thinking when the situation calls for it ‚Äì particularly when he is at the receiving end of a gun or when the security of International Rescue is compromised. As the eldest brother, Scott nearly always assumes a leadership role. Scott Tracy is also one of the few members of International Rescue to have killed someone. He killed the evil Zombites in their pyramid hideout in \\"The Uninvited\\" (he also probably killed Gomez and Gillespie in \\"Move ‚Äì And You're Dead\\"). The others are Gordon on \\"Operation Crash Dive\\" and Alan on Thunderbird 6. Background Scott's likeness was based on actor Sean Connery. Along with Jeff and Virgil, Scott is the only other Tracy to appear in all 32 episodes of Thunderbirds, although he does not take part in the rescue operation in \\"The Perils of Penelope\\". He also does not play an active role in \\"Atlantic Inferno\\" as he was in temporary command of International Rescue. The voice of Scott was provided by Shane Rimmer. Thunderbirds 2004 film In the film, he was portrayed by actor Philip Winchester. Since the film focused on Alan Tracy, not much is known about this version of the character. Thunderbirds Are Go!

The main attraction of the park is the Delaware Canal which runs parallel to the Delaware River between Easton and Bristol. The Delaware River is the longest free-flowing river east of the Mississippi River in the United States. It serves as a major migration path for American Shad and waterfowl. A visitor's center is located at New Hope and the park management office is located in Upper Black Eddy. Within the park are two designated natural areas: Nockamixon Cliffs and River Islands. Recreational opportunities include hiking, biking and cross-country skiing along the towpath, fishing in the canal and river, and canal boat rides. Delaware Canal State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". The Delaware Canal State Park frequently floods. The path was restored recently but was washed out again due to flooding in April 2011. Canal paths for the Delaware and Raritan Canal on the New Jersey side of the Delaware have not suffered the same damage. Course West Trenton Line rail in the background The Delaware Canal runs from the mouth of the Lehigh River in Easton along the Delaware River south to Bristol. The land along the canal is a mixture of private property and state park lands, with the state park covering some along the of the canal. Note: shows Delaware Canal State Park Note: shows Delaware Canal State Park The course of Delaware Canal State Park is as follows: leaving Easton, the canal enters Williams Township in Northampton County, and heads south paralleling the Delaware River. The park crosses into Bucks County and passes through the following municipalities: the borough of Riegelsville, the townships of Durham, Nockamixon, Bridgeton, Tinicum, Plumstead, and Solebury, the borough of New Hope, back into Solebury Township, Upper Makefield and Lower Makefield townships, the borough of Yardley, back into Lower Makefield Township, and the borough of Morrisville. The Delaware River has followed a southeast course until now, but after Morrisville in Falls Township it turns approximately ninety degrees to flow southwest. The canal and park turn southwest earlier and leave the river in Morrisville, cutting off this corner. The park and canal pass through Falls Township to the borough of Tullytown, where they again follows a course parallel to the river. From Tullytown the canal passes through Bristol Township and ends at the borough of Bristol. History The Delaware Canal stretches from Bristol to Easton along the Delaware River. It was used to haul coal and other products from the Lehigh Canal beginning in Mauch Chunk (today Jim Thorpe) to the industrial centers of the Philadelphia area near Bristol, Pennsylvania. The canal was built in the mid-19th century and ran its last commercial traffic on October 17, 1931. The state bought of the canal in 1931 and bought the remaining in 1940. The Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal and its towpath became Theodore Roosevelt State Park in the early 1950s, when the berms were restored and the canal was refilled with water. The park was renamed Delaware Canal State Park in 1989. The U.S. Congress designated the Delaware Canal as a Registered National Historic Landmark and its towpath is a National Recreation Trail. From the mid 1950s until 2006, visitors to the park were given the chance to explore the canal in mule-drawn canal boats operated from a landing at Lock 11 in New Hope, and operated north of that point, terminating about north of the Lock 11 landing, near the Rabbit Run and U.S. Route 202 bridges, but was able to navigate all the way to the Virginia Forrest Recreation Area, about north of the Lock 11 landing for private parties. Due to lack of maintenance of the canal by DCNR and floods, the barge concession was forced out of business. Natural areas Pennsylvania state park natural areas are special areas that are set aside within the state parks to allow the natural condition of biological and physical processes to operate, usually without human intervention. There are two such areas at the Delaware Canal State Park: River Islands and Nockamixon Cliffs. These natural areas are set aside to provide scientists with the chance to observe the natural ecosystems at work and to protect examples of unique and typical plant life, animal habitats, and to protect examples of natural beauty. River islands There are eleven islands in the Delaware River that are protected from further development. The islands contain archeological clues to the past, provide habitats for migrating waterfowl and songbirds, and offer recreational opportunities in a wild setting for fisherman and canoeists. Some of the islands were originally part of the shoreline of the river and have since been cut off by the effects of erosion, river movement or intervention by man, but other islands have been built up naturally in the river. These river islands grew from silt deposits that attracted seeds. The seeds grew into plants and trees. The roots of the plants and trees caused the further building of silt and dirt and lead to the formation of the islands. These islands are mostly stable but can be shifted by the erosion effects of the river and flooding. Nockamixon Cliffs The cliffs along the Delaware River, known as Nockamixon Cliffs, appear to rise from the land, but are in fact formations of very hard stone that have eroded at a much slower pace than the surrounding land. These cliffs are made of weather resistant rock called hornfel, formed at the end of the Triassic Period when magma rose up from deep within the Earth's crust and flowed into beds of sedimentary rock. The cliffs \\"rose\\" during the Jurassic Period when the surrounding sandstone and shale was eroded by wind and water. The Nockamixon Cliffs are situated along the river in such a way that the north facing cliffs in Pennsylvania receive little to no direct sunlight, causing their temperatures to be cooler than normal. The cool habitat supports an alpine-Arctic plant community that is very unusual for the latitude of Delaware Canal State Park. The south facing cliffs in New Jersey at Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park have a nearly opposite habitat. They receive a high amount of sunshine, which makes the area near the cliffs warmer and drier than usual, creating a habitat for plants that normally thrive in much more arid areas. American shad The Delaware River is used by American shad during their spawning run. The fish are the largest members of the herring family. They are an anadromous species, which means they are born and spawn in fresh water but spend the majority of their lives in salt water (of the Atlantic Ocean). After spending three to six years at sea, the shad return to the waters of their birth to spawn. Unlike salmon, not all shad die after spawning; some survive and return to the ocean. The American Shad have long been a vital food resource for the people living along the Delaware River. The Lenape (or Delaware) tribe depended on the migration of the shad as a staple of their diet. They harvested the fish and prepared them in several ways. Some fish were grilled quickly on wooden racks and others were preserved for later use by smoking them or air drying. The Moravians and other early European settlers in the Delaware River Valley also depended on shad for their diets. The booming population along the Delaware River, especially in Philadelphia, Easton, Camden and Trenton, led to increased levels of pollution in the Delaware River. Sewage and industrial pollution combined with extensive overfishing nearly led to a total collapse of the shad population. The pollution was so bad that in the years following World War II nearly of the river was a dead zone, free of dissolved oxygen. This dead zone prevented the migration of shad. Dams built during the canal era to provide water for the canals also limited the migration patterns of the shad. The combination of dams and pollution nearly caused the shad to abandon the Delaware River and its tributaries altogether. Beginning in the late 1960s, an effort began to re-establish the population of American Shad in the Delaware River basin. Pollution levels dropped tremendously, and fish ladders were built to allow the shad to bypass the dams that blocked their way and to migrate further up the river. These efforts have led to the restoration of the American Shad in the Delaware River. Recreation A lock on the Delaware Canal, seen near Yardley, Pennsylvania The Delaware Canal towpath runs along the canal for from Easton to Bristol and was once used by teams of mules as they towed the barges up and down the canal. Today it is a National Recreational Trail open to walkers, joggers, cyclists, bird watchers and cross-country skiers. Five bridges over the Delaware River connect the paths in Delaware Canal State Park with paths in New Jersey at the Delaware and Raritan Canal State Park. The Delaware River and the Delaware Canal are warm water fisheries. Common game fish include the American shad, striped bass, walleye and smallmouth bass. The river is also popular with people who wish to explore it in canoes and other small non-powered watercraft. All boats must have a launch permit for Pennsylvania or New Jersey or a current registration from any state.

Ayu was created by Naoki Hisaya who wrote her scenario for the visual novel, and designed by Itaru Hinoue. Hisaya commented on how he thought Ayu was the one character in Kanon that he felt he grasped the best, but noted it was very difficult to write her character due to Ayu being primarily energetic. After Hinoue drew wings on Ayu's backpack, Hisaya suggested that they remove them due to spoiler reasons, and while Hinoue went along with it at the time, the wings were later included once again. Yuichi Aizawa, the protagonist of Kanon, meets a lively seventeen-year-old Ayu on the day after he moves to the city depicted in the game. As the story progresses, Yuichi discovers that she is trying to find something she lost, but she cannot remember what it is; Yuichi tries to help her in her search, but with no initial success. One of her most defining characteristics is the repeated utterance of her catch phrase which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, anger, and fear. Her favorite food is taiyaki, and she is seen eating the confection many times throughout Kanon. The main focus of both Kanon anime is Ayu, who has also appeared in all of Kanons adaptations, and has been incorporated into numerous d≈çjin games. Ayu makes a cameo appearance in the second episode of the Air anime series along with Nayuki, and Makoto Sawatari from Kanon. Her voice actresses are Yui Horie in the Japanese versions of the visual novel and anime, and Brittney Karbowski in the English version of Kyoto Animation's Kanon anime, who also voiced Ayu during her cameo in Air. A leitmotif named is associated with Ayu which is played in Kanon numerous times during scenes which involve her, and is also used in a similar fashion throughout Kyoto Animation's Kanon anime. In a review by Anime News Network, Ayu is described as a character that \\"persists on a degree of earnest cuteness that will endear her to some viewers.\\" Creation and conception Naoki Hisaya, who wrote Ayu's story, commented in an interview that the night before he was to present the beginning of a Kanon scenario, he suddenly remembered wanting to write for some time about a ghost girl who waits for the protagonist to come back to her. He said that he wanted to write this no matter what and quickly drew up an outline for the premise of Ayu's scenario. At the time, Ayu's premise was the start of the entire Kanon story, though it was still very vague. Eventually, Hisaya was able to form her story into the style of a romance visual novel, and in the process the characters in the story started to multiply. Hisaya said that Ayu was the one character in Kanon that he felt he grasped the best, but noted it was very difficult to write her character due to Ayu being primarily energetic. Hisaya said that he is much better at writing about quiet characters, so Ayu gave him a lot of trouble. Hisaya noted that Ayu's frequent use of \\"ug≈´\\" was not decided from the beginning, and that it merely turned out that way during the natural writing process. Ayu's character designer, Itaru Hinoue, commented in an interview that she put a lot of effort into Ayu's design, and Ayu was her favorite character to create among the Kanon characters. Hinoue was able to design Ayu any way she wanted, and by all means she wanted Ayu to wear her large tan duffle coat, and be depicted as a strong character. Hinoue said that she was very particular about Ayu's attire, but not about everything. At the time she was formulating the character design, many festivals were going on in Osaka, Japan where Key is located. When Hinoue had a chance to attend, there were many people around wearing angel wings as part of the festival, and because she thought they looked cute, she later chose to draw them onto Ayu as well. Hinoue later read Ayu's finished scenario and became aware of an unintentional form of foreshadowing on her part due to wing imagery factoring into Ayu's story. Shortly after, Hisaya suggested to Hinoue, \\"Since they seem to have become a spoiler, let's lose the wings.\\" The wings were thus removed, but before long they were attached again. While Hinoue had originally chosen the colors for the hair and eyes of the characters herself, these were later discussed by the development team and altered accordingly, though Ayu, Mai, and Nayuki did not change much. It came to the point where Hinoue had to constantly go back and forth between her intentions and what was later decided by consensus. Characteristics Ayu is a strange and mysterious seventeen- year-old girl, the same age as Yuichi, though due to her short stature at 154 cm (5'1\\") and comparatively low body weight at 41 kg (90 lbs), she is perceived initially by Yuichi to be much younger; in fact, Ayu is the shortest and least heavy character introduced in Kanon. Ayu's three sizes are 80 cm - 52 cm - 79 cm (31\\" - 20\\" - 31\\"), and are the closest to Shiori's despite Shiori being one year younger. When first introduced, Ayu is seen wearing a large tan duffle coat over a sweater and shorts, despite the cold winter weather, and is the only Kanon character seen to regularly don mittens. On her feet, she wears brown argyle socks and snow boots. She is immediately recognizable by the red Alice band in her short brown hair, and a small backpack she wears which has two attached wings on either side. In later appearances, she is sometimes seen without her coat or mittens. As a child of ten, Ayu is depicted wearing a pink sweater, a short skirt, and a large white bow in her hair, which is grown-out slightly longer than when Ayu is seventeen. Since childhood, Ayu has referred to herself with the masculine pronoun ‚ÄîJapanese for \\"I\\", a rare occurrence among females. Ayu is notorious for her catch phrase, , which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, anger, and fear. Her favorite food is taiyaki, and she is seen eating the confection many times throughout Kanon. Ayu comes off as somewhat strange, such as initially tackling Yuichi and yelling his name whenever she would spot him. These tackling fits eventually diminish in severity to simple taps on the back as time goes on or even simply calling out his name when appearing seemingly out of nowhere behind him. She can be clumsy at times, and is prone to tripping. Ayu tends to be na√Øve about common things, such as not knowing what a mobile phone is, but enjoys learning about new things. Yuichi quickly discovers how terrified Ayu will become at even the mere mention of ghosts or demons. When put into an uncomfortable situation, such as having to walk alone at night, she is noticeably jumpy and is prone to screaming. Appearances Visual novel Ayu Tsukimiya is introduced as girl running from a taiyaki salesmen when she collides with Yuichi Aizawa, the protagonist of Kanon, in the shopping district. Yuichi and Ayu become fast friends after she meets him several more times in the shopping district, and Ayu helps him remember that they first met and became friends during Yuichi's last stay in the city seven years previous. A focus in Ayu's storyline is that she is constantly searching for something she has lost, but she does not even remember what it is, which troubles her greatly. Yuichi plays an active role in helping her try to find the item with no initial success. Shortly after Yuichi and Ayu become involved in an intimate relationship, Ayu remembers what happened in the past and disappears without a trace. Seven years before the onset of the story, Yuichi first met Ayu in almost exactly the same place as where they collided at the beginning of Kanon. Ayu was crying at the time due to the recent death of her mother, and in an effort to make her feel better, Yuichi bought her taiyaki, which in turn became her favorite food. They met up several more times over the winter school break, and one day Yuichi obtained a small angel doll from a claw vending machine and gave it to Ayu. Yuichi stipulated that he would grant any three wishes she wished on the doll within his limited power. Her first wish was for Yuichi to never forget her. Yuichi took Ayu into the nearby forest to a clearing with a large tree in its center. There, Ayu made her second wish that they could go to school together. Due to this, they decided to make this tree their own private \\"school\\" with special stipulations such as no homework or tests, and taiyaki is served for lunch everyday. Afterwards, Ayu decided to bury the doll in a jar near the forest. On the last day of winter break, while Yuichi and Ayu were attending their \\"school\\", Ayu was sitting up in the tree when a strong gust of wind came and knocked her out of it, causing her to land on her head and fall unconscious. This accident is what caused the young Yuichi to suppress his memories of his childhood. After Yuichi remembers what happened in the past, he assumes Ayu died, which causes him to become depressed. During this time, Yuichi remembers the doll that Ayu buried, and gathers his friends to go find it. Once he finds and repairs it, he goes to the now cut-down tree in the forest clearing until Ayu appears again. They have a tearful reunion where Yuichi reminds her of the angel doll, and that she still has one more wish left. Ayu suggests that she might wish for Yuichi to not remember her at all, and move on. After they embrace, Ayu simply vanishes again. Yuichi later discovers that Ayu did not die, and had been in the hospital for seven years in a coma, making her an ikiry≈ç. Ayu miraculously wakes up from her coma and the two are shown out in town about to go back to Yuichi's house. Other Kanon media Ayu has appeared in other media adaptations based on the Kanon visual novel which includes light novels, drama CDs, manga, and anime. Of the five light novels written for Kanon, Ayu is the main focus of the final installment entitled . Two of the fifteen drama CDs released had Ayu as a main focus, and Ayu appears in the five anthology drama CDs. In the first official Kanon manga, Ayu's story is made the main focus, and her story is the only one of the five heroines to go into detail and reveal the latter portions of her story. Conversely, in the second manga version, Ayu is only the main focus of the final chapter, but is given the second highest number of pages in the manga behind Nayuki. Ayu has also appeared in Kanon's numerous manga anthologies. In 2002, Toei Animation produced the first Kanon anime and featured character design by Y≈çichi ≈ånishi who based the designs on Itaru Hinoue's original concept. In 2006, Kyoto Animation produced a new rendition of the Kanon anime with updated visuals and a more detailed story; character design was headed by Kazumi Ikeda who also worked off of Hinoue's original artwork from the visual novel. In both anime, Ayu is given the focus as the main heroine, and Yuichi ends up falling in love with her in both versions as well. Outside Kanon Ayu (left), Nayuki (center), and Makoto (right), as they appear in the Air anime Ayu has appeared in many works outside Kanon, as well as being cited as being extremely popular and recognized in both Japan and the west. Ayu especially \\"has had more appearances outside the original Kanon than any other anime or H-game character ever.\\" Ayu has appeared in countless d≈çjin games such as Glove on Fight and Eternal Fighter Zero. In the anime adaptation of Air, another of Key's visual novels, Ayu makes a cameo appearance in episode two along with Nayuki Minase and Makoto Sawatari as regular girls who talk with Yukito Kunisaki briefly. As reported in the Kanon Visual Fan Book for the visual novel, Key had once planned to release a social simulation game with the tentative title featuring Ayu, as she appears at ten years old, as the game's sole heroine. The game was expected to be released on June 30, 2000, though Key never mentioned the game again. Other games announced at the time which involved Ayu as the main focus were an action game named , a role- playing video game called , and a quiz game entitled . Musical theme A leitmotif named is associated with Ayu and is played in Kanon numerous times during scenes which involve her; it is also used in a similar fashion throughout Kyoto Animation's Kanon anime adaptation. It is first heard during Ayu's first appearance in both the visual novel and the aforementioned anime version. The theme is composed by Shinji Orito, one of Key's signature composers, and is the longest of Kanon's five leitmotifs on the Kanon Original Soundtrack at 3:04 minutes. A remix version by Magome Togoshi appeared on the Kanon soundtracks Anemoscope and Recollections. \\"Hidamari no Machi\\" was composed in common time in the E-flat major key, and moves at 126 beats per minute. The theme was composed on a synthesizer which primarily used a piano as a base, along with violin, vibraphone, and percussion accompaniment throughout the piece. Orito commented on the song in the Kanon Original Soundtrack booklet where he remarked, \\"This is probably the song I like most out of all the theme songs...I think the percussion is really good.\\"Untranslated quote: Cultural impact Megatokyo, a webcomic that takes much of its inspiration from Kanon, references Ayu. First, in strip 67 \\"Saving Points\\", Ayu is shown eating taiyaki. This is, in fact, a reference to a Kanon d≈çjinshi called Quarter Iceshop, as stated by Megatokyo's artist Fred Gallagher in his commentary during the publication of volume one of his webcomic, as well as the \\"rants\\" accompanying the strip itself. Also, in strip 224 \\"packing away\\", Gallagher draws himself wearing Ayu's backpack and mentioning her catchphrase \\"ug≈´\\", as well as stating that the backpack was the \\"official winged backpack from Kanon.\\" Ayu has been parodied in several anime. Episode eight of Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi parodies Kanon and other adult games. In it, Ayu's Japanese voice actress Yui Horie plays a girl that is modeled after Ayu, and references taiyaki and \\"ug≈´\\" near the end. In episode four of Lucky Star, Konata gives a tardy excuse to her teacher Nanako, stating that she was late because there was a girl running away from a taiyaki seller; after listening to the excuse, Nanako utters \\"ug≈´\\" out of frustration. Another parody in Lucky Star is that when Kagami scolds Konata in episode 13 when she complains about her winter break being occupied by homework, Ayu's backpack appears behind Konata, and she utters \\"ug≈´\\". In Mission-E, a character greatly inspired by Ayu appears on a manga cover near the middle of episode 11. In My Bride Is a Mermaid, Sun eats a taiyaki and says \\"ug≈´\\" in episode two, and G≈çzabur≈ç crushes a taiyaki and says \\"ug≈´\\" in episode 20. In a review by Anime News Network of the first anime DVD volume of Kyoto Animation's Kanon anime, Ayu is described as a character that \\"persists on a degree of earnest cuteness that will endear her to some viewers.\\" In the same review, Ayu's winged backpack is cited as possibly being a \\"little overkill\\" in regards to the moe attributes of the series. Newtype USA stated in an article on Kanon that, \\"Ayu beams brightly with joy as she munches on her favorite fish-shaped crepe, looking so adorable you almost wanna pinch her.\\" G. B. Smith from The Fandom Post noted how Tsukimiya stands out within the cast of sad children due to her cheerful personality. The writer also emphasized the emotional strength of Tsukimiya's story arc and her relationship with the main character. Stig H√∏gset from THEM Anime Reviews noted that while some character elements of Ayu might give the viewer \\"some hurdles to overcome,\\" the entire cast remained appealing in the 2006 anime series. John Sinnott from DVD Talk simply referred to her as \\"the typical 'cute kid' who even has a silly word she says whenever she's angry or upset ('Ugu').\\" Todd Douglass Jr. from the same website said that while her introduction might be predictable based on harem series, he found that the cast became interesting. Active Anime writer Holly Ellingwood referred to her as \\"cute and rather enigmatic\\" and hoped Yuichi could remember the apparent bond they used to share. In the Newtype \\"Top 100 Anime Heroines\\" from 2003, Ayu ranked 23rd. Merchandise Four figurines of Ayu were produced by different manufacturers in 2007. The earliest was released on January 29 by Movic which also came with a chibi version of Ayu dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. The next was released on July 2 by Russian Blue, and the third followed a month later on August 6 by Kotobukiya which was in fact a reproduction of a model previously released. The fourth figurine was released on October 19 by Max Factory, and was the most expensive of the four. An official \\"ug≈´\\" audio CD was coupled with the 127-page Kanon Visual Memories art book for Kyoto Animation's Kanon anime adaptation released on June 24, 2007 by Ichijinsha. The CD contains eighty-six variations of Ayu's iconic catch phrase featured in the anime, and is voiced by Yui Horie. The CD spans ten minutes, though most of the duration is silent due to each \\"ug≈´\\" lasting less than two seconds on each track, resulting in about one-third of the CD as rendered blank.

He trained with Josse de Corte. He is best known for over 150 statues produced by him and his studio for the estate and gardens of a single villa in Vicenza, the Villa Lampertico (also known as Villa Conti or La Deliziosa). Many are stock characters from commedia dell'arte theater; others depict the so-called bravi (desperadoes). They vary in quality, and are often executed in local stone. For the same villa garden, Marinali also completed a large fountain group: la Ruota, symbolizing the four corners of the world.

They stand there alongside statues by the Paduan sculptor Antonio Bonazza who was influenced by Marinali.

Her husband was the founding emperor Emperor Wu (Chen Baxian). Zhang Yao'er was from Wuxing Commandery (Âê≥Ëàà, roughly modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). Her father Zhang Jingming (Á´†ÊôØÊòé) was originally surnamed Niu (Èàï), but was adopted by a family named Zhang, and therefore had his name changed. Her mother was named Su (Ëòá), but her mother's surname is not known to history. Zhang Yao'er was not Chen Baxian's first wife, as Chen had initially married a daughter of Qian Zhongfang (Èå¢‰ª≤Êñπ), who, like Chen and Zhang, was from Wuxing Commandery, but Lady Qian died early, so he married Zhang after Lady Qian's death. Zhang Yao'er was described as being well-versed in mathematics, poetry, and the Chu Ci. She bore Chen at least one son, Chen Chang, but it is not known whether any other of his at least five other sons (none of whom survived to adulthood) or either of his two known daughters, the Princess Kuaiji and Yongsi, was hers. In 545, with Jiao Province (‰∫§Â∑û, modern northern Vietnam) seized by the rebel Li Ben, Chen Baxian, then a Liang Dynasty general, was sent to Jiao Province to battle Li; at that time, rather than taking Lady Zhang and Chen Chang with him, he sent them back to Wuxing. After the general Hou Jing rebelled in 548 and subsequently captured the capital Jiankang in 549, both she and Chen Chang were taken captive by Hou, but despite Chen Baxian's subsequent major participation in the campaign against Hou, Hou did not kill her or Chen Chang. After Hou was defeated in 552, Emperor Yuan of Liang created Chen Baxian the Duke of Changcheng for his contributions, and Lady Zhang became the Duchess of Changcheng. Her son Chen Chang, despite his young age (15), was made the governor of Wuxing Commandery, but subsequently was summoned by Emperor Yuan, along with Chen Baxian's nephew Chen Xu, to the new capital Jiangling, to serve at the central government and to effectively serve as hostages. In 554, after Jiangling was captured by Western Wei forces, Emperor Yuan was executed, while Chen Chang and Chen Xu were taken as honored captives to the Western Wei capital Chang'an. After Jiangling's fall, the supreme general of the remaining Liang territory, Wang Sengbian, along with Chen Baxian, who was then in charge of Jingkou (‰∫¨Âè£, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), prepared in spring 555 to make Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an, emperor, but subsequently, under military pressure from Northern Qi, Wang accepted Northern Qi's proposed candidate for the throne, Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang. In fall 555, however, Chen made a surprise attack on Jiankang, killing Wang and deposing Xiao Yuanming, declaring Xiao Fangzhi emperor instead (as Emperor Jing). In the next two years, Chen defeated Northern Qi forces and affirmed his grip on power, taking the throne from Emperor Jing in 557 and establishing Chen Dynasty (as Emperor Wu). He created her empress and created her mother as the Marchioness of Anji. Emperor Wu made repeated requests to Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou to have Chen Chang and Chen Xu returned, but Northern Zhou, despite initially agreeing, never actually freed Chen Chang or Chen Xu. In 558, the Marchioness of Anji died, and Emperor Wu subsequently posthumously created Zhang Jingming the Marquess of Guangde, burying the marchioness with him with honors. In 559, Emperor Wu suffered a major illness and died quickly. At that time, Emperor Wu's nephew Chen Qian the Prince of Linchuan, the only close male relative of Emperor Wu then in Chen territory, was constructing a fort at Nanhuan (ÂçóÁöñ, in modern Anqing, Anhui), and Empress Zhang, after consulting the officials Du Leng (ÊùúÁ®ú) and Cai Jingli (Ëî°ÊôØÊ≠∑), chose not to announce Emperor Wu's death, and they secretly summoned Chen Qian back from Nanhuan. Chen Qian soon returned to Jiankang, with the general Hou Andu. Hou and the officials subsequently decided to support Chen Qian as emperor, but Empress Zhang was still hopeful that Chen Chang would return, and therefore refused to allow Chen Qian to inherit the throne. Hou approached her and, with his hand on the handle of his sword, requested that she turn over the imperial seal. She finally agreed, and Chen Qian took the throne (as Emperor Wen). Emperor Wen honored Empress Zhang as empress dowager, and she took up residence at Cixun Palace (ÊÖàË®ìÂÆÆ). She did not appear to have much power during Emperor Wen's reign, and in 560, when Chen Chang returned from Northern Zhou and made suggestions that he would contest the throne, Emperor Wen had him drowned. In 566, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Fei, who honored her as grand empress dowager. In 569, when Chen Xu (who had by this time returned from Northern Zhou as well) seized the throne from Emperor Fei, he had the edict deposing Emperor Fei and making him emperor (as Emperor Xuan) issued in her name, although there is no evidence suggesting that she was actually involved in Emperor Xuan's seizure of the throne. After Emperor Xuan took the throne, she was again titularly empress dowager. She died in 570 and was buried with honors due an empress, with her husband Emperor Wu.

Canadian researchers 'create' leukemia stem cell, watch disease unfold. CBC News, April 26, 2007. Early life and education Dick was raised on a farm in southern Manitoba. His early education was gained in a one-room schoolhouse. Later he moved to Winnipeg to study to become an X-ray technician. There he noticed one of his roommates was attending university and studying biology. Dick realized he was more interested in biology and decided to switch pursuits. Dick started off at the University of Manitoba specializing in microbiology and graduating with a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1984. Career and research In 1984, he moved to Toronto. In order to support his wife and two children, Dick worked part-time at an X-ray lab while he finished his post-doctorate work in Alan Bernstein‚Äôs lab. Bernstein, a noted cancer researcher whose Ph.D. advisor was James Till at the Ontario Cancer Institute, guided Dick to research cancers of the blood. Over the next five years, Dick developed an in vivo repopulation assay using the NOD/SCID mouse. This technique of using an immune-deficient mouse to generate human hematopoietic cells won Dick international recognition.\\"Black Box\\" of Cancer Breaks Open .

In 1994, Nature published his paper which described how cancer stem cells grow slowly. Dick explained, \\"Most kinds of chemotherapy are designed to kill fast-growing cancer cells. This is why leukemia can come back after treatment. To get rid of the cancer, you have to find ways of eliminating the stem cells.\\" Many researchers dismissed Dick's discovery as interesting, but something not likely to apply to solid tumours. In 1997, Dick reported the detection of cancer stem cells at the root of three other forms of leukemia. This time he presented it as the \\"cancer stem-cell hypothesis\\". His model stated that there are different cancer cells and amongst them there is a pecking order in which the abnormal stem cell, is both the key to forming and feeding a cancer. Therefore, without an abnormal stem cell, cancers will not grow. This time his report was considered a breakthrough.Stem Cells May Be Key to Cancer.

Dick has transformed the study of human hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, with his development of methodologies for transplanting human bone marrow into immune-deficient mice, with resultant multilineage repopulation of murine bone marrow and other hematopoietic tissues. Using this approach, he has identified long-term repopulating human hematopoietic stem cells and generated mouse models of leukaemia. His studies showing that a specific subset of leukemic cells are actually capable of recapitulating tumour growth are recognised as the foundation for all current work on the cancer stem cell model and its application to cancer therapy.

A UK hardcover was issued by Dennis Dobson in 1972, with a Star Books paperback following in 1977. A French translation appeared in 1973. American reprint editions were later issued by Bart Books and by Wildside Press.ISFDB publication history Fourth Mansions was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1970, and placed fifth in the Locus Poll for best novel in the same year.Science Fiction Awards Database Plot introduction Fourth Mansions was inspired by Teresa of √Åvila's Interior Castle, and contains quotations from the book, which Lafferty uses as chapter headings. The Interior Castle is a metaphor for an individual's soul; its different rooms, different states of the soul. In the middle of the Castle the soul is in the purest state, which equals Heaven. Lafferty uses more complex symbols in telling a many-sided tale of an individual's reaching towards Heaven or Truth. The novel concerns a time of great change, when four forces ‚Äì in the form of secret societies ‚Äì contend to control the next phase of humanity's history. In the middle is Fred Foley, an innocent reporter. One of these forces intends to unleash a deadly virus on the US, the others attempt to stop them. A revolution by Mexican migrants, the craft of \\"mind weaving\\" and a strange group of \\"Patricks\\", all apparently tramps but with great resources, appear in the center of a narrative. It has been noted that Illuminatus! repeated several of the themes of this book, including the plague and secret society elements. Reception James Blish recommended Fourth Mansions, calling it \\"inventive\\" and \\"fascinating straight through-and as a dividend, it is often funny\\", but faulted it for \\"a whole lot of over-writing\\" and \\"speeches that could never come out of a human mouth\\".

She was recognized nationally as a political activist working for African-American education and civil rights. She gained a national reputation as president of Saints Industrial and Literary School, which she developed over 50 years from a few students in 1926 to a private K-12 academic school and junior college on 350 acres. It was affiliated with the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ, in which Mallory had been active since about age 18. At a time of disenfranchisement of blacks, segregation, and historic underfunding of black education in the South, Mallory contributed to emerging national networks of black women. She drew from them and white philanthropists to raise money for the school. Saints was instrumental in black education in Mississippi; for many years, it was the only accredited high school for blacks in its area. It attracted students from nearly every state and from African nations due to its strong academic reputation; over the decades, Mallory educated an estimated 20,000 students through Saints. In addition, Mallory became a national leader in the COGIC Women's Department. From the 1940s, she helped to create wider civic engagement of church women; they worked for a \\"sanctified world.\\" Through the National Council of Negro Women, of which Mallory was a charter member beginning in 1935 and vice-president for many years, she worked for education and civil rights for African Americans. She engaged with national leaders such as Mary McLeod Bethune in the NCNW to raise funds to support her school in Mississippi and to draw women leaders into greater public life. In 1963 she was appointed to serve in President John F. Kennedy's administration. Through Saints and her civic activities, Mallory promoted her advocacy for the mostly black and poor sharecroppers in the county and for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1968 she was the first woman and person of color to be elected to the Holmes County Board of Education. In 1974 she was elected to a second term. Biography Arenia Mallory was born in Jacksonville, Illinois in 1904 to parents who were successful in show business. She originally trained as a concert pianist. At about age 17, she became involved with the Pentecostal Church of God in Christ. Her parents were more worldly, and the church's strict teachings led her to become estranged from her family. The church opposed members being involved in any show business, had dress standards that forbade women from wearing make-up, and had other restrictions. Mallory earned a bachelor's degree from Simmons College of Kentucky (1927), a historically black college. In the course of her first decade working in Mississippi, she earned a master's degree in education in 1936 from Jackson State University, the top-ranked historically black college in the state. Later Mallory returned to university for additional graduate studies, earning a master's degree in administration from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1950). She was popularly addressed as \\"Dr.\\", as an honorific reflecting the respect she commanded. Career As a young woman, Mallory was invited by Charles Harrison Mason, founder of the COGIC in Lexington, Mississippi, to serve as a music teacher at a local religious school for black students started by a teacher who promoted COGIC teachings. Mallory knew there was a great need for black education in the state and evangelized for the fast-growing church. Early in her time there, she organized a group of five singers and toured with them to raise money for the school. During the heart of the Great Depression, they performed at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, New York and raised $8,000 in donations. Later Mallory developed a larger school chorus, the Jubilee Harmonizers, who toured and became nationally famous. They eventually performed at the White House for President Franklin D. and Eleanor Roosevelt. Their touring helped to raise funding for what became known as the Saints Industrial and Literary School. As Mallory became a national leader, she used payments from her own speaking engagements to build the collection of the school's library; it was the only African-American school in the area to have a well-equipped one. It became known both for its \\"quality education and Christian principles.\\"Faustine Childress Jones-Wilson, Encyclopedia of African-American Education, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, pp. 396-397 Mallory was president of the school from 1926 to her death in 1977, overseeing its expansion to grades K-12, and strengthening the curriculum. The campus was developed to have classrooms and dormitories worth more than one million dollars. A junior college department was developed before 1963. Saints Academy attracted students from nearly every state and from nations in Africa, educating \\"tens of thousands\\" of students. Mallory had established high standards for Christian behavior and education. Parents who had moved north for work in the Great Migration of the first half of the 20th century often sent their children back to Lexington to be educated at Saints Academy, for a strong education on their home grounds. Through the decades, Mallory led the students through the period of integration of public schools, and the broadening role for blacks after passage of civil rights legislation. She helped develop many African-American leaders. The school was renamed as Saints Academy, and remained affiliated with the Church of God in Christ until its closure in 2006. Religious and political activism Mallory advocated providing health and welfare services to the mostly black and poor sharecroppers in Holmes County, Mississippi. It had been a center of cotton plantations in slavery times. Much of the rural population continued to be farmworkers. From her early years at the school, Mallory raised money for the mostly poor students, so they would have shoes and clothes. She was instrumental in orchestrating several programs in the county to raise money, books, and clothing for her students. In 1934, during the Great Depression, Mallory hosted the sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) Mississippi Health Project. The sorority consisted of rural teachers in neighboring counties. Her continuing work with this sorority led to national networks, which helped gain funding for her school in Lexington. In her focus on education, Mallory also established classes for adults, especially the parents of her students. In the 1960s, she received a grant to set up classes for migrant farm workers. Mallory was an active member of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) Women's Department, acting as a leader in the national church. In that position, she met other national leaders, forming an alliance with Mary McLeod Bethune, who founded the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) in 1935 to expand the power of the women's club movement beyond the black elites. In the 1940s and 1950s, the COGIC women worked to integrate their work toward sanctified lives with civic engagement in broader alliances outside their community. Mallory was a strong advocate for black and women's rights. A charter member of the National Council of Negro Women,Anthea D. Butler, Women in the Church of God in Christ: Making a Sanctified World, Univ of North Carolina Press, 2012; pp. 120-122 founded in 1935, she supported its goals to improve education and rights for African Americans. For years, she worked within its national network to raise money for her students and Saints Industrial School. She served as the Vice President of NCNW from 1953 to 1957. From 1952 to 1955 in this period, Mallory also served on the board of directors of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, a civil rights organization led by Dr. T.R.M. Howard of the all- black community, Mound Bayou, Mississippi.David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, Black Maverick: T.R.M. Howard's Fight for Civil Rights and Economic Power (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009), 76, 109. They promoted advancement for blacks by stressing education and training for work. Mallory was appointed as an advisor to the U.S. Department of Labor (1963) in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. Learning about the Head Start program that year, she established the first one in Mississippi at her school. In 1968 Mallory was the first woman and first person of color to be elected to the Holmes County Board of Education.Olivia L.

He first worked as an apprentice with a jeweler in Kristiansund. He was trained as a dentist in Kristiansund with later training at the University of Oslo and in Berlin. He contracted tuberculosis and in 1885 moved to Lillehammer to start a dentist practice and promote his recovery. At this time he was the only dentist in Gudbrandsdalen. On a travel to Skj√•k in 1894, he came to the realization that Norwegian farmers had not yet begun to appreciate their cultural heritage. He acquired his first house, a dwelling house built in 1764 that had previously been described by Eilert Sundt. It was known as Lykrestua and Sandvig set it up in his backyard. By the turn of the century he had six antiquarian buildings and a large amount of other objects. The city of Lillehammer set aside an area known as Maihaugen and bought Sandvig's collection and established the Sandvig Collections (De Sandvigske Samlinger) in 1904.

He was invariably referred to as \\"W. H.\\" rather than by his given name. Born 14 September 1863 in West Brompton, London, of parents from Alton, Hampshire, Allen was for many years Director of the Farnham School of Art in Surrey. He produced several thousand watercolours, chalk and pencil sketches mainly of the landscapes, traditions and people of West Surrey and North-east Hampshire. In addition, he produced scenes of other parts of the British Isles and various parts of contintental Europe. These works included commissions in Italy for the Victoria and Albert Museum, Dublin, Edinburgh and Preston museums.(exhibition catalogue) He was made a member of the Royal Watercolour Society in 1903 and the Royal Society of British Artists in 1904 and his work was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1927. He moved from Surrey to Wylye, Wiltshire in 1932 and is buried at St Nicholas's Church, Fisherton de la Mere. Many of Allen's paintings are regularly displayed at the Allen Gallery in Alton. These include landscapes of the local East Hampshire countryside at the beginning of the 20th century. Style and Influences Dante, W. H. Allen Many of his paintings were produced \\"in the field\\" and are bold in their depiction of light and shadows, or of changing weather conditions. His studio works are generally larger and of greater detail. Very few were sold on the open market, but he did exhibit regularly at the major galleries and annual exhibitions. Allen embraced many styles and techniques from vivid, almost abstract, watercolours to more traditional oils and watercolours. His field sketches and studies are considered to be particularly successful and were painted in all weathers and conditions. He was a private and modest man who changed peoples' perception of their surroundings. In this he was helped by fellow Farnham resident and friend George Sturt, whose writings reflect Allen's approach to the recording of rural life and change. Thanks to their work, urban and rural landscapes began to be preserved at a time when \\"progress\\" was causing sweeping changes. In the 1880s, the depiction of life and work in the countryside was subject to two very different approaches, the traditional rural romanticism/sentimentality - thatched cottages with roses around the door and contented happy harvest scenes (e.g. Myles Birkett Foster), and that of social realism - recording child labour and exploitation, agricultural depression, bad weather, hard work and hard labour (e.g. Sir George Clausen). By the time Allen started recording the countryside around Farnham in the 1890s, Britain was in the grip of a severe agricultural depression which continued until the late 1930s, mirroring his artistic output. Royal College of Art and early study tours Allen entered the Royal College of Art in 1884, where he came under the influence of its Director, Thomas Armstrong, a disciple of William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. This was to remain his predominant influence throughout his working life as an artist and teacher. In 1888 he was awarded a silver medal and a scholarship of ¬£50, enabling him to travel to Europe, the first of many continental trips which resulted in some of his finest work. Teaching Allen was still a student at the Royal College of Art when he became an evening lecturer in Design, being awarded the college's Diploma of Associateship at the same time. He then became master of the Sydenham Art Class, after receiving a reference from his college principal, who considered him \\"the most successful lecturer and instructor I have known\\". In November 1889 Allen was appointed Master of Farnham Art School where his abilities were soon recognised by Farnham Urban District Council and later Surrey County Council, as he was made Director of the Art School, a post he retained until his retirement in December 1927. Allen gave private wood carving lessons to Harold Falkner who later became an architect and leading light in the preservation of Georgian Farnham. Stranger's Corner By 1897 Allen was sufficiently settled in the Farnham area to commission Harold Falkner to design a house for him. Situated on the Tilford Road, \\"Strangers Corner\\" was to remain Allen's home until 1932, and is the subject of one of his best-known paintings, now in the Farnham Museum. Falkner later paid tribute to Allen's contribution to the early building conservation movement in an article published in Country Life in July 1942: \\"Allen transformed our outlook, which thought nothing of our Georgian past and relegated its furniture to the attics if it were not sawn up\\". The Allen Gallery, Alton This gallery, whilst dedicated to the memory of Allen, shows works by a wide variety of artists and has frequently changing exhibitions, including occasional large exhibitions of Allen's work.

The park offers a variety of recreational opportunities including picnicking, golf, ball fields, biking, hiking, hunting, horseback riding, and fishing. Evansburg State Park is near Collegeville and Norristown just off Pennsylvania Route 363. History The land on which Evansburg State Park is located was originally part of a massive tract of land purchased from the Lenape (Delaware) by William Penn in 1684. The land was quickly settled according to Willam Penn's planned \\"Holy Experiment\\". The first settlers were Mennonites. They fled religious persecution in Europe for the religious freedom, promised by William Penn in his colony. The Mennonites cleared the land of its old-growth forests and built farms, stores and mills that were powered by the waters of Skippack Creek. The area developed very rapidly and the Skippack Pike was constructed in 1714 to provide access to the markets of Philadelphia. The area in and surrounding Evansburg State Park remained largely rural until World War II. The growth of suburbs and industry forever changed the landscape of the Skippack Valley. Evansburg State Park was established in 1979 to protect the rural qualities of the area and to provide outdoor recreational opportunities for the people of southeastern Pennsylvania. The original plan was for the construction of a high dam and lake for recreation, but this was met by local opposition, and the plan was scaled back. The Indenhofen Farm is operated by the Skippack Historical Society and open to the public. Kuster Mill is also located in the park.Skippack Historical Society Recreation Fishing and hunting Skippack Creek is stocked with brown trout and rainbow trout; other fish in the creek include smallmouth bass, catfish, sucker, carp, panfish, and freshwater eel. All fishers are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. About of Evansburg State Park are open to hunting. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are squirrels, pheasant, rabbits and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Golf The golf course at Evansburg State Park is known as Skippack Golf Club. It is an 18-hole , par 70 golf course. It was designed by Herris & Benahia, and opened in 1950. The course is managed by Skippack Golf Club, LLC under contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Trails Evansburg State Park has of trails that are open to hiking, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, and mountain biking. The of hiking trails are all rated as easy trails and pass through a variety of habitats. A mountain bike trail () is open at the south end of the park. Bikers are prohibited from using the hiking and equestrian trails. They are permitted to ride on the park roads. Fifteen miles of horseback riding trails are open at Evansburg State Park. Riders are also permitted to use the shoulders of the roads of the park.

He is the son of a Gambian father and a Danish mother and the twin brother of Simon Richter. On 20 July 2009 while playing at Hvidovre Stadion, Richter was struck by lightning which resulted in cardiac arrest. He was put into a medically induced coma and cooled to as part of the Danish standard cardiac arrest procedure. As a result of the injuries sustained, Richter was supposed to stay in the medically induced coma until 29 July. Medical staff at Hvidovre Hospital had hoped to be able to wake Richter from the coma soon after the accident but Richter's recovery was slower than hoped. This resulted in the doctors pushing back bringing Richter out of the coma twice. Around August 1, Richter was taken out of the coma and on August 2, when doctors removed the last parts of the respirator equipment, Richter started to speak almost immediately. When club owner Allan K. Pedersen called Hvidovre Hospital to check on Richter, Richter himself told doctors to tell Allan K. Pedersen that everything was good. Doctors are still unable to tell whether Richter's brain has suffered damage and Richter is to remain hospitalized for an indefinite period of time so doctors can make sure his body has recovered from the electric shock. In late August 2009, Richter and his medical advisors decided to amputate Richter's lower left leg. This has, according to medical sources, dramatically improved Richter's general well-being. FC Nordsj√¶lland retired Richter's number 26 after his forced retirement from football at the age of 24.

Early life Le√Øla Sebbar was born on 9 November 1941, in Aflou. The daughter of a French mother and an Algerian father, she spent her youth in French Algeria before leaving aged seventeen for Paris,'Sebbar, Le√Øla', in Barbara Fister, Third world women's literatures: a dictionary and guide to materials in English, Greenwood Press, 1995. where she now lives. Career Sebbar writes in French about the relationship between France and Algeria and often juxtaposes the imagery of both countries to show the difference in cultures between the two. She deals with a variety of topics, and either adopts a purely fictional approach or uses psychology to make her point. Many of Sebbar's novels express the frustrations of the Beur, the second generation of Maghribi youth who were born and raised in France and who have not yet integrated into French society. Her book Parle mon fils, parle √† ta m√®re (1984; Talk my son, talk to your mother), illustrates the absence of dialogue between two generations who do not speak the same language. The novel tells the story of the final day of a dying man who came from Algeria to France as a young man seeking work. It depicts the story of his youth and shows his viewpoint on the Muslim society and the \\"3 witches\\". The reader comes to realise that the man in the story is not fearful of those \\"witches\\" but just of dying alone, without another Muslim by his side to read to him the prayer of the dead. Sebbar never names her characters to keep a sense of anonymity and mysteriousness and it could be said that it does not restrict the story to one personal account but it could relate to anyone and shows the very common viewpoint of those seeking asylum.

Historically, the concept of a protector developed in offshore jurisdictions where settlors were (perhaps understandably) concerned about appointing a trust company in a small, distant country as sole trustee of an offshore trust which is to hold a great deal of the settlor's wealth. However, protectors now form a part of mainstream tax planning in most jurisdictions which recognise trusts. There are a number of reasons that a settlor may wish to appoint a protector in relation to a trust: * protectors allow a great degree of flexibility when dealing with changes in circumstances, including both factual circumstances (death, premature divorce, previously unknown children) and legal changes (any legal changes, but most frequently changes to applicable revenue laws); * the settlor may be concerned that the trustee may not pay sufficient attention to his wishes; * the settlor wishes certain powers to be withheld from the trustees; or * the settlor wishes a third party to act as a main point of contact, between the beneficiaries and the trustees. The powers vested in the protector vary both according to the proper law of the trust and the terms of the trust instrument. They include power to: # remove and appoint trustees; # approve a change of proper law; # approve the addition or removal of beneficiaries; # approve proposed trust distributions; # approve the appointment of an agent or adviser either generally or in relation to specific matters; # approve investment recommendations; # appoint replacement protectors; and # terminate the trust or approve the termination of the trust. Conceptually many commentators have difficulty with the idea of a protector, as this undermines the role which in law has historically been fulfilled by the trustees. As protectors are a relatively recent innovation in trust law, case law is scant. Is it not even clear if as a matter a law a protector would owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries (although in practice, many trust instruments expressly state that they shall).Although legislation in Idaho seems to assume that in that state at least a protector is a fiduciary. It is sometimes suggested that where the protector is too close to the beneficial interest in the trust (for example, if the protectors have power to confer benefits upon themselves, directly or indirectly) this may destroy the essential nature of the trust. If the protector has power to grant beneficial interests in the trust fund to the settlor, this may have disastrous tax consequences in some jurisdictions.

It was once Canada's fourth largest building supply chain with 138 stores. In 2000 it was purchased by Home Hardware, a cooperative of over 1000 independent Canadian hardware stores. Beaver Lumber stores were rebranded as Home Building Centres. History Beaver Lumber, once Canada's leading supplier of lumber, building materials and related products and services, began in 1883 as the Banbury Bros. Lumber Company in Wolseley, Saskatchewan. Banbury Bros. Lumber Company bought its local rival, Gibson Lumber, in 1904 and two years later joined with the Regina Lumber and Supply Co., creating a business with twelve lumber yards. A thirst for expansion resulted in the Banbury brothers striking a deal with some Winnipeg lumber yards. A new name was needed that was in some way connected to wood, so when Edwin Banbury suggested \\"Beaver\\", the company identity was created in 1906 and would become an institution in parts of Canada for another 90 years. Beaver Lumber was a community-based business and focused on building relationships with its customers. The company eventually operated 130 stores across the country. Molson, the Montreal-based brewing giant, bought Beaver Lumber for $40 million in 1972. In 1987, Groupe Val Royal entered into a strategic agreement with the Molson Companies to acquire the Castor Bricoleur locations in Qu√©bec and integrated them to its Brico Centre chain, a hardware retailer that was already operating three stores at the time. After Val-Royal launched the R√©no-D√©p√¥t chain in 1993 with its warehouse format, the eight Brico Centre stores were deemed too small to continue in the new economy and were progressively phased out from Quebec's retailing landscape. Molson sold the rest of retail chain to Home Hardware for $68 million in 1999. Legacy The first store opened by Edwin and his brother, Robert, was sold to the Wolseley Museum Association in 1980, who subsequently closed it and sold it to local entrepreneur, Jacquie Jacobs-Marshall. It stands on Blanchard Street and has been proposed as a future site of the Wolseley Heritage Foundation Archive. Beaver Lumber's last Head Office at 7303 Warden Avenue in Markham is now home to Lyreco, Brookfield Properties and TTI.

He attended the University of Utah in Salt Lake City where he majored in chemistry and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1942. He then served in the US Army. After the war, he went to medical school and received his Doctor of Medicine degree with honors from the University of Chicago in 1948. After an internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, he trained at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease (NIAMD),The National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease (NIAMD) is now the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases or NIAMS a part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. He then worked as a research associate at the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory at Harvard Medical School and as a visiting investigator at the Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York. Seegmiller returned to NIH in 1954. He was appointed senior investigator at NIAMD, and in time became Chief of Human Biochemical Genetics. In 1969 Seegmiller started on his second career. He left NIH to become a founding faculty member of the new Medical School of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and became the first head of the Arthritis Division of the Department of Medicine. Seegmiller embarked on his third and last career in 1983 when he was appointed founding Director of the Stein Institute for Research on Aging (SIRA) at UCSD.

Biochemical genetics Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome In 1964 medical student Michael Lesch and pediatric faculty member Bill Nyhan at Johns Hopkins Hospital reported finding an X-linked recessive disorder in two young brothers with progressive mental retardation and a bizarre tendency to self-mutilation. Because the boys had abnormally high blood levels of uric acid, Lesch and Nyhan called it A familial disorder of uric acid metabolism and central nervous system function.Lesch M, Nyhan WL. A familial disorder of uric acid metabolism and central nervous system function. Am J Med 1964;36:561-70. . It was only three years until the biochemical basis of the disease was identified by Jay Seegmiller and his colleagues at NIH. They discovered that this rare genetic disease, Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, was due to a profound deficiency of an enzyme known as hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, or HGPRT, for short.Seegmiller JE, Rosenbloom FM, Kelley WN. Enzyme defect associated with a sex-linked human neurological disorder and excessive purine synthesis. Science 1967;155:1682-4. . Kelley‚ÄìSeegmiller syndrome Seegmiller's laboratory team at NIH went on to discover that some men have partial HGPRT deficiency that causes high levels of uric acid in the blood and leads to the development of gouty arthritis and the formation of uric acid stones in the urinary tract.

Early life Born in Portland, Myers' childhood was spent in the coastal community of Tillamook, Oregon. He lived with his family briefly in Zimbabwe (known as Southern Rhodesia at the time) when he was 10 and in a 2004 interview with The Oregonian described it as \\"a mind-blowing experience.\\" They lived miles from the nearest white family, and Myers said that he learned an enduring lesson in the futility of racism. [1] A graduate of Portland's Benson High School (1945), Myers went on to the University of Oregon, where he founded the Zeta Omicron chapter of Lambda Chi Alpha (ZO 009), led the Young Republicans, and promoted student involvement in elections, campaigns and political issues. He studied law at Northwestern College of Law in Portland and attended the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut.[1] Before entering politics, he pursued a business career in banking and insurance. Myers and his wife Elizabeth had three children, Carolyn, David, and Richard Clay. Political career Clay Myers at a 1968 news conference Myers' first held office as Oregon Secretary of State, being appointed to that post in 1967 by Tom McCall who had vacated the office to become governor. Myers had been a staff member on the McCall gubernatorial campaign. He was elected to the office in 1968, and re-elected in 1972. In 1974, he was defeated in a bid for the Republican nomination for Governor by Vic Atiyeh, whom he had previously recruited to run for the state legislature. Term limits prevented his running for reelection in 1976, so he entered and won the race for State Treasurer. He served seven years in that office, to complete an exceptional eighteen years in continuous service in statewide public office. Latter years After leaving office, Myers returned to the business world, joining J.P. Morgan Investment Management in New York. He retired in 1989, and returned to Oregon, where he remained active in community and church affairs. Health problems, including a lengthy battle with cancer, prompted his move in 1999 to Tubac, Arizona. Long disenchanted with the rising social conservatism of the Republican Party, Myers announced in 1999 that he had registered as an independent, turning the tables on a quotation of Ronald Reagan by saying at the time, \\"I didn't leave the party. The party left me.\\" In 2003, he registered as a Democrat in support of Howard Dean's primary campaign, later actively working to elect John Kerry.Esteve, Harry. \\"GOP's right turn turns Myers off\\" (Eugene) Register Guard, May 23, 2004, 3F.

Founded initially in 1972 by Christopher R, a year later Indian Magique became San Diego's most famous street theater. Its original members included Christopher R, John William See, Hugh Monahan, Ralph Steadman, Wayne (Bernard) Baldan, Sally Brown, Frank Muir, Alan Aimes, J. Michael, Francine Lembie, and Sam Woodhouse. Rehearsing in the loft of the old Spreckels Building in San Diego, California, the troupe initially performed on the weekends in the Zoro Garden's amphitheater located in Balboa Park. These performances included their original shows Corn Dogs On Parade and the original comedia Peepee's Revenge. Both of these shows were presented at the Los Angeles Theater Festival receiving standing ovations. When the group's head writer John William See left the group in 1974, Indian Magique began relying on outside material. By 1975 they were performing See's one act play Tag for high school assemblies in the greater San Diego area, mentoring theater students at the respective high schools, and performing The Duchess of Malfi, which toured California. In 1976, Sam Woodhouse and D. W. Jacobs established the Rep in its first home, the Sixth Avenue Playhouse. Woodhouse and Jacobs remain the company's co-directors, with Woodhouse as artistic director and Jacobs as producing director. In 1980, the company reunited two of the original Indian Magicians when presenting the world premiere of John William See's The Lady Cries Murder, directed by Christopher R. The production was voted the best play of the year by the San Diego Tribune, and its popularity allowed the Rep to achieve the status as one of San Diego's premiere theaters. From that point on the San Diego Repertory would present 19 premieres and 12 West Coast premieres of plays such as American Buffalo and K2. The company's world premieres during this period included Gold! ‚Äîa production that included Whoopi Goldberg, a founding member of the company. Mission The company describes its mission as producing \\"intimate, exotic, provocative theatre.\\" Since moving to the Lyceum it has presented 43 world premieres and 37 mainstage productions by Latino playwrights. The 1998 production of It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues was nominated for a Tony Award. Lyceum Theatre and Gallery In the 1980s a dilapidated old theatre, the Lyceum on F Street in Downtown San Diego, was scheduled to be demolished to create the Horton Plaza shopping center. The Rep obtained permission to use the 400-seat theatre as a second performance site until it was torn down. The larger venue gave the company a higher profile and a doubled budget. Also, the company's ability to draw thousands of theatergoers to a downtown site increased the pressure on the developers to include a theater in the Horton Plaza project. So a theater space was identified, completely underground below an already-built drugstore, and developed into a performing arts complex with two venues: a 550-seat mainstage theater and a flexible performance space that can accommodate up to 250 seats. The city owns the facility, which is overseen by the nonprofit Horton Plaza Theatre Foundation. In 1986, the San Diego Repertory Theatre moved into the new Lyceum Theatre and assumed the duty of Resident Manager of the Lyceum complex, which also provides services to other arts and community organizations. The Lyceum Gallery holds art exhibitions in conjunction with the theater that usually run the length of the productions. In a single year, 350-400 performances are presented in the theaters, with an annual attendance of over 150,000 people. Of these events, two-thirds are co- productions between the Rep and more than 40 community organizations. In 2017 the theater completed a $3.9 million renovation of the facility.

He is known for his hard working style of play and can also be noted for scoring from midfield. He announced his retirement from inter-county football in November 2011. Playing career McGinley plays his club football for Errigal Ciar√°n GAC. He was a member of the Tyrone minor team who won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship under Mickey Harte in 1998. With Harte again in charge he won two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship titles in 2000 and 2001. He was there when Harte guided Tyrone to the National League title in 2003 and then their first All Ireland later that year. He picked up his second All Ireland in 2005. McGinley has suffered a number of injuries during his career. In 2003 he suffered a broken neck in the twelfth minute of the All-Ireland final during a clash with Armagh player Tony McEntee, but unaware of the seriousness of his injury he played on before spending weeks afterwards in a neck brace. In 2004 he fractured his skull in a training ground accident, while in 2005 he almost missed the All-Ireland final after picking up a leg injury in the semi- final against Armagh. Just two months after the final, he sustained a serious knee injury in a club game and required reconstruction on his cruciate ligament. His playing came to the fore in 2008, when Tyrone unexpectedly made it to the All-Ireland final, with commentators such as Adrian Logan attributing a lot of the credit to McGinley's form. He was described as being among the top three midfielders in the 2008 championship. Tyrone went on to win the championship for the third time in six years. He finished his inter- county season by representing Ireland in the 2008 International Rules Series. Management career McGinley has become a manager, such as with the Derry GAA club Swatragh.

In some parts of the United States and Canada, some confusion may result as the term is often used interchangeably with pointing (to correct defects or finish off joints in newly laid masonry) and repointing (to place wet mortar into cut or raked joints to repair weathered joints in old masonry). History The tuckpointing method was developed in England in the late eighteenth century to imitate brickwork constructed using rubbed bricks (also rubbers and gauged bricks), which were bricks of fine, red finish that were made slightly oversized, and after firing, were individually abraded or cut, often by hand, to a precise size. When laid with white lime mortar, a neat finish of red brick contrasting with very fine white joints was obtained. Tuckpointing was a way of achieving a similar effect using cheap, unrubbed bricks; these were laid in a mortar of a matching colour (initially red, but later, blue-black bricks and mortar were occasionally used) and a fine fillet of white material, usually pipe clay or putty, pushed into the joints before the mortar set. Ministry of Defence (Defence Estates), Sutton Coldfield, England, accessed 2007-10-17 The term tuckpointing derives from an earlier, less sophisticated technique that was used with very uneven bricks: a thin line, called a tuck, was drawn in the flush-faced mortar, but left unfilled, to give the impression of well-formed brickwork. ‚ÄúWigging‚Äù, an Irish technique similar in effect, reverses the order. The white ribbons are applied first, and the surrounding mortar filled or colored to match. Tuckpointing tools Here red mortar is used. The white fillets are laid out at regular spacing, which does not always coincide with the rough spacing of the joints. Professional tuckpointers use tools, which, depending on the country and local trade terminology, are sometimes termed \\"jointers\\", \\"tuck irons\\" or \\"tuckpointing irons\\"; primarily in London where the trade originated. Tuckpointing tools were originally made from wrought iron by blacksmiths in England during the 18th century. Modern tuckpointing tools are constructed from hardened tool steel, and typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal ferrule. The tool surface has a sharply pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface. The thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool common ranges from to . The thickness and width of these tools are dependent upon the mason's preference and the type of brick or stonework they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework. There are many types of tuckpointing tools. Standard and flat-bottomed tools were once the most-commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because they could be easily manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are versatile and can be used for a variety of jobs. Tuckpointing tools are sometimes \\"beaded\\"; these tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading-edged hammer against a red-hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined and now a small fillet is ground into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the perps (gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs vertically perpendicular to the ends) or gaps in the brickwork.. \\"Lines\\" run in the horizontal direction. The lengths of tools varies based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are between and . Masons and bricklayers sometimes need shorter or longer tuckpointing tools. Shorter tools help the worker access hard-to-reach spots; these tools are referred to as \\"stubnose\\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \\"longnose\\" tools. They are available in many beaded or grooved profiles. Rounded corner tuckpointing tools are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface that helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. The process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is cut away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen knife, a type of knife with a small, sharp, bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines. Many historic homes with classic Italianate architecture are examples of recent tuckpointing, such as Werribee Mansion at Werribee Park in Victoria, Australia, which displays the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between its bluestone architecture.

Biography  Son of Ashkenazi Jews who fled the Nazi persecution during the World War II (Belgian father and Polish mother), Sobel was born in Lisbon, Portugal. While he was an infant his family moved to New York City where he grew up and was eventually ordained a reform rabbi in 1970. In the same year, he accepted an invitation to be the rabbi at Congrega√ß√£o Israelita Paulista and established himself in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In his own words, it \\"made possible my actuation in the social and politic fronts and gave me the chance of engaging myself\\".From God's country: Henry Sobel's pluralist city, VisitSP.com interview As of 2007, he had two colleagues sharing the rabbinate, Rabbi Michel Schlesinger and Rabbi Yehuda Busquila. During the 1970 and 1980's Sobel had an extraordinary role in protecting the human rights in Brazil (at that time governed by the military). Along with Catholic Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns and others, Sobel showed great courage in denouncing the assassination of journalist Vladimir Herzog by right wing military in Brazil. He had also a great role in promoting inter-religious dialogue in Brazil and elsewhere by cultivating excellent relations with Catholic dignitaries, including the Pope John Paul II. During more than 30 years, Sobel was recognized as an informal leader of the reform Jewish community in S√£o Paulo. Sobel has one daughter, Alisha, born in S√£o Paulo in 1983.

On March 30, Sobel was admitted to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. According to the doctors, due to \\"an episode of mood disorder, represented by a lack of emotional control and altered behavior.\\" The hospital also reported that he had been taking large quantities of drugs to treat severe insomnia that \\"cause potential states of mental confusion and amnesia.\\" On April 2, Sobel gave a brief press conference at the hospital. \\"I don't know where to start,\\" he began. \\"I am taking relatively strong medications. Regarding what happened, it is very hard for me to explain the inexplicable. I do not have scientific and psychological knowledge to understand, explain and, much less, justify what occurred, but one thing I know: the Henry Sobel who committed that act is not the Henry Sobel you know.\\" He ended saying: \\"I want to close with an apology, and I also want to make a commitment. I want to apologize for the distress that I caused, especially for having taken medication without a medical prescription. I want to apologize for the distress that I caused everybody, and I want to make a solemn commitment: I intend to keep on defending all the moral and ethical values that I have always stood up for, as a Jew, a man and a rabbi.\\" Death Sobel died of cancer on 22 November 2019, in Miami, Florida.

It is closely related to, and forms a superspecies with, the pink-headed warbler of southern Mexico and Guatemala. There are three subspecies, found in disjunct populations, which differ primarily in the color of their ear patch and in the brightness and tone of their body plumage. The adult is bright red, with a white or gray ear patch, depending on the subspecies; young birds are pinkish-brown, with a whitish ear patch and two pale wingbars. Breeding typically occurs between February and May. The female lays three or four eggs in a domed nest, which she builds on the ground. Though she alone incubates the eggs, both sexes feed the young and remove fecal sacs from the nest. The young fledge within 10‚Äì11 days of hatching. The red warbler is an insectivore, gleaning primarily in understory shrubs. Although this bird is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), its numbers are thought to be declining due to habitat destruction. Taxonomy The subspecies C. r. rubra has a white, rather than gray, ear patch. English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century. The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each other's closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: *C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca. *C. r. melanauris, originally described and named by American ornithologist Robert Thomas Moore in 1937 as Ergaticus ruber melanauris, has dark gray ear patches and somewhat more scarlet upperparts than C. r. rubra. The subspecific name is derived from the Ancient Greek melan- \\"black/dark\\", and Latin auris \\"ear\\". It is found from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit. *C. r. rowleyi was originally described and named by R. T. Orr and J. D. Webster in 1968 as Ergaticus ruber rowleyi, in honor of J. Stewart Rowley, a research associate at the California Academy of Sciences. It has white ear patches and ruby-red upperparts (brightest of the three subspecies), and is found in the Sierra Madre del Sur, from Guerrero to southern Oaxaca. \\"Red warbler\\" has been designated the official name by the IOC. It is a straightforward reference to its color. The genus name Cardellina is the diminutive of the Italian cardella, a regional name for the European goldfinch, while its specific name, rubra, is Latin for \\"red\\". Description Subsp. melanauris from below The red warbler is a small passerine, measuring in length, and weighing from . As an adult, it is red overall, with either a white or dark gray (depending on the subspecies) auricular patch on each side of its head. Its wings and tail are slightly darker, dusky red, and edged in pinkish-red. Its legs are a dull red-brown, and its thin bill is pinkish-gray with a dark tip. The iris is dark brown to blackish. Plumage varies little between the sexes, although the female tends to be a little duller or more orange-tinged. Adult pairs separate and moult fully from August, after the breeding season. The adult red warbler is hard to confuse with any other bird species in its range; the scarlet tanager and summer tanager have similar mostly-red plumage but are larger with thick conical bills. As a juvenile, the red warbler is pinkish-brown with a whitish auricular patch. Its darker wings and tail show pinkish-cinnamon edges, with two paler wingbars on the former. Voice The red warbler has several common calls, including a high, thin tsii and a stronger pseet. Its song is a mix of short trills and richer warbles, interspersed with high- pitched chips. Unlike other species in the same habitat zone, it tends to sing only during bright morning hours during the breeding season. It does not sing ‚Äì and even its calling frequency decreases ‚Äì in cloudy weather, regardless of season. Distribution and habitat Endemic to the highlands of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the red warbler has three disjunct populations that correspond to the three subspecies: from southwestern Chihuahua to northern Nayarit, from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca, and from Guerrero into southern Oaxaca in the Sierra Madre del Sur. It is fairly common to common in the country's interior and on adjacent slopes, where it occurs at elevations ranging from above sea level; it does not occur along either coast. It is an altitudinal migrant, moving from higher humid or semi- humid pine, pine-oak and fir forests in the breeding season to lower elevations, often in oak forests, in the winter. It is among the most common of the small birds in its woodland habitat, second only to the golden-crowned kinglet in fir forests in one study and the third most common warbler in oak- conifer woodlands in another. Though the species was reported to have been collected in Texas in the late 19th century, the record's location was not widely believed, and there is no strong evidence that it ever occurred there. It has strayed as far north as southeastern Arizona, where a bird was found on Mount Lemmon in 2018. Behavior Though it occasionally joins mixed-species flocks, the red warbler is more typically found alone or in pairs. Youngsters probably choose mates in the autumn of their first year, and pairs remain together year-round, except during severe weather and during post-breeding molt. Breeding The red warbler breeds primarily in early spring, from February until May, though at least one nest containing young has been found as late as the end of June. By late February, the male establishes a territory that averages about 40 square metres, defending it with song. Other males may intrude by silently flying in at a height of around 3 m (10 ft) and back to their own territory. Deep incursions result in combat, after which the interloper usually leaves. Beginning in mid-March, the male courts the female by chasing her through the undergrowth. The pair then perch together while the male sings and the female calls softly. The female alone builds the nest, a task which typically takes 4‚Äì6 days. She chooses a sunlit area, such as an area of windfall, the brushy edge of a trail or water course, or a small clearing, for its location. Tightly woven of plant material, the nest is hidden in ground vegetation and anchored to the stalks of surrounding vegetation. The nest, which is usually oven-shaped with a side or upward- facing entrance, measures roughly wide by long by high. Bulky and untidy on the outside, it is typically constructed primarily of dead pine needles and dead grass, though gray lichens, green moss, dead leaves, shreds of bark and tips of fern fronds are also used; most of these materials are gathered from the ground close to the nest, though some is picked from low branches or further away. A few nests are only cups, lacking the roof of the more typical structures. Inside, the nest is tidy and compact, lined with fine grasses and plant fluff, which is generally gathered some distance from the nest. Early in the breeding season, there may be a gap of as many as 11 days between the completion of the nest and the laying of the first egg. Later in the season, this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready. The female normally lays three eggs, though clutches of up to four have been recorded. The eggs, which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots or white with cinnamon and rust spots densely ringing the larger end of the egg, measure by and weigh . The female alone incubates the eggs for 16 days; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch. She sits facing the back wall of the nest, with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening. She sits tight at the approach of danger, typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest. Both adults feed the nestlings and remove fecal sacs, though the female removes far more than the male does. The parents move deceptively when approaching the nest, foraging ‚Äì or pretending to forage ‚Äì in nearby vegetation. They stay only a few seconds in any one spot, including at the nest, making it more difficult for a predator to locate the young. Nestlings make a rapid, high-pitched peeping call as an adult approaches carrying food. They fledge within 10‚Äì11 days of hatching. Young birds are fully grown three weeks after fledging, upon which time they are driven off by their parents. Food and feeding A red warbler in typical habitat The red warbler is an insectivore. It gleans primarily in understory shrubs at low to middle levels, moving slowly and deliberately through more open areas of the vegetation, and feeding with quick jabs into cracks in bark and pine needle clusters. It sometimes hovers briefly to feed at pine needle clusters, a foraging technique known as \\"hover gleaning\\". Though it lacks any obvious adaptations for climbing, it regularly does so in its search for prey items on bark and epiphytes on branches, often hanging head-down as it probes. In areas of deciduous growth, it typically flycatches, making brief aerial sorties from a perch in pursuit of flying insects. While it seldom associates with mixed-species flocks, it often feeds alongside other birds with no signs of conflict, displaying no hostility towards other species‚Äîsuch as the slate-throated whitestart (Myioborus miniatus)‚Äîwith which it competes. It has been observed chasing off a flycatcher of the genus Empidonax. Its foraging area is quite small, often amounting to only a few dozen square meters (several hundred square feet) per day. Late in the afternoon, its rate of foraging declines, and it rests, often taking brief naps, in the forest understory. Though it does not generally feed after sunset, it may do so to take advantage of transient food sources, such as hatching Neuroptera. Parasitism and predation The red warbler is presumably hunted by small hawks such as the sharp-shinned hawk, and its nest raided by wrens, rodents, raccoons, feral cats and snakes. Isospora cardellinae is a protozoan species that has been isolated from a red warbler from Nevado de Toluca National Park, Mexico. It is a parasite that lives in cells in the villi of the bird's small intestine. Toxicity In the 16th century, Friar Bernardino de Sahag√∫n had reported that a red bird matching the description of the red warbler was regarded as inedible by the Aztecs. Researchers Patricia Escalante and John W. Daly isolated two alkaloids in preliminary investigations of the feathers. The presence of these alkaloids render the bird unpalatable; humans find it inedible. Conservation and threats The red warbler is currently rated as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Though there is evidence that its numbers are decreasing, the decline has not been precipitous (that is, under a 30% decline over ten years or three generations), and the population remains quite large, estimates ranging from 50,000 to 499,999 birds. The forested areas in which it occurs include some of the most threatened habitats in Mexico; logging, agricultural expansion, firewood gathering, road building, tourist development, overgrazing and intensive urbanization are among the many things contributing to the destruction of the forests. There is some evidence that selective logging in pine forests may actually favor this species, which prefers more open, sunlit areas in which to breed.
