The use of post-nominal letters by all recipients was allowed from 1993. A Bar, instituted in 1993 as well, could be awarded in recognition of further similar displays of meritorious service and devotion to duty.

Early life Joseph Koenig was born near Niesse, Germany, the seventh of nine children of Josef and Magdalena Koenig. His father died in his native country and subsequently his mother came to the United States with her children in 1872, settling in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Koenig went to Indianapolis, Indiana in 1873 at the age of 15 and worked as a painter and decorator. In 1880 he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin and attended the Normal College of the American Gymnastic Union, for one-year course of study, graduating in 1881. In 1881, he moved to Louisville, Kentucky where he taught for three years while also attending the University of Louisville School of Law. He graduated in 1884. Mr. Koenig was married to Miss Emma Susanna Kraft in Louisville, Kentucky, November, 1884. He and his wife had two children, Remus (1885‚Äì1955) and Ruby (1887‚Äì1968). In 1884 he move to Wichita, Kansas where he was admitted to the bar in the state of Kansas, and practiced law for several years, and also speculated in real estate. In 1886, Koenig co-founded a vinegar factory that operated after he moved from Wichita until 1970. In 1884, he formed a partnership in Wichita, Kansas named Adams and Koenig for cutting and dressing stone and selling bricks and plaster. This company only lasted 2 weeks and resulted in a lawsuit that was appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court. A business decline left him bankrupt and in 1891 he moved to Chicago, Illinois. After moving to Chicago he taught for three years. During that time he became interested in aluminum ware. At his request his cousin, Arthur Reymond, exhibited some of this aluminum ware at the World's Fair in 1893. Koenig made similar exhibits in San Francisco and St. Louis. Most of the goods he displayed were imported from Germany. Due to the success he had in selling the goods, he decided to start manufacturing aluminum goods in the United States. Aluminum era In 1895 he returned to Wisconsin to found the Aluminum Manufacturing Co. at Two Rivers. This company, the first aluminum fabricating plant in Wisconsin, was merged with other firms in 1909 to become the Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Company. The name of the company was changed to Mirro Aluminum Company in 1957. Before its closure in 2003, it was the largest aluminum cookware company in the world. He also cofounded the Two Rivers Coal Company in 1899. The coal company was sold to the C. Reiss Coal Company in 1913. C. Reiss later became part of Koch Industries as a subsidiary of Koch Carbon. In 1905 he cofounded The Wisconsin Automobile Supply to provide tires, repairs and accessories so that automobile owners would not have to order them from Milwaukee or Chicago. Joseph cofounded the Metal Ware Corporation in 1920. The Metal Ware Corporation is still operating and is current owner of the NESCO brand. Koenig held numerous patents on aluminum products, including the U.S. army canteen used during World War I. His first patent was issued when he was 18. His production of patents started 21 years later and continued for almost 30 years up until the year before his death. Retirement and personal life He retired from active business life shortly before his death, and lived in retirement in Two Rivers, Wisconsin. Koenig was a lifelong physical fitness enthusiast and advocate as evidenced by his choice of schools and his association with gymnasiums and a natatorium. This began with his attendance at the American Gymnastic Union from 1880 to 1881. This school was moved in 1907 to the Athen√¶um in Indianapolis and had a strong emphasis on physical exercise, anatomy, and physics. The school was incorporated into Indiana University in 1941. He continued with his association with the Turner Movement as an instructor at the Turnverein in Indianapolis, and later as the director. His association with the turners continued after his move to Wichita, Kansas in 1884. Koenig constructed a natatorium in 1889 and operated it until he moved from Wichita. Joseph Koenig was an avid outdoorsman and the society columns in the local newspapers often carried reports of his hunting trips. Mr Koenig was an early example of a technophile. He owned the first practical automobile in Manitowoc County and in 1922 owned the first practical radiophone. He was a Blue Lodge Mason and a member of the Elks. When the Two Rivers School system opened a new grade school in 1931, the school was named the Joseph Koenig School. The school is currently called Koenig Elementary School.

Summary The MJTC treatment program was developed for and implemented in the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center in 1995. The Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center is a secured correctional facility located on the grounds of the Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison, Wisconsin. It is operated as a secured correctional facility through the department of corrections, but housed on the grounds of a State mental health facility. Youth who are transferred to MJTC are selected by the staff of juvenile corrections institutions due to their failure to respond to the traditional rehabilitative programming provided in correctional institutions, nearly always because of their excessively violent and/or disruptive behavior. While MJTC was not designed to treat psychopathy per se, many of the youth in the original treatment sample do have high levels of psychopathic traits.Caldwell, M.F., McCormick, D.J., Umstead, D., Van Rybroek, G.J. (2007) Evidence of Treatment Progress and Therapeutic Outcomes Among Adolescents With Psychopathic Features. Criminal Justice and Behavior 34: 573.  Treatment features  The MJTC program is based on the theory of defianceSherman, L. (1993). Defiance, deterrence, and irrelevance: A theory of the criminal sanction. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 30, 445-474 and the social control theory.Gottfredson, M., & Hirschi, T. (1990). General theory of crime. Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press.Sampson, R., & Laub, J. (1990). Crime and deviance over the life course: The salience of adult social bonds. American Sociological Review, 55, 609-627. The theory of defiance can be used to describe a subgroup of offenders who react to punishments for crimes by increasing the frequency or seriousness of violent or other criminal behavior. Further punishment becomes cyclical as the youth's behavior continues to worsen in reaction to increasingly severe punishments. The cycle further isolates the youth from conventional goals and values and he/she becomes \\"compressed\\" or \\"trapped\\" into an increasingly defiant behavior pattern. The social control theory posits that when the social bonds that connect the youth to conventional society are strained, delinquency arises. For delinquent youth, barriers have developed that restrict the youth's ability and desire to form conventional and productive social bonds, which in turn facilitates increased antisocial behavior. These patterns of antisocial behavior, even in the face of punishment, and have prevented this subgroup of antisocial youth from engaging in traditional rehabilitative programs in the juvenile correctional system.

Zimmerman, and T. Coultry. 1986. Aggression Replacement Training. Champaign, IL: Research Press. Primary themes of the program include helping youth accept responsibility for their behavior, resolving mental health issues, and helping to build positive relationships with families. The MJTC program focuses on helping youth develop appropriate social skills, and to help youth replace delinquent associations and behaviors with pro-social relationships and activities. In so doing, the aim of MJTC is to break the compression cycle of increasing antagonistic, violent and antisocial defiance of authority and to replace it with appropriate pro-social bonds.Caldwell, M. F., Vitacco, M., & Van Rybroek, G. J. (2006). Are violent delinquents worth treating? A cost‚àíbenefit analysis Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 43: 148 DOI: 10.1177/0022427805280053 MJTC also uses a behavioral point system called the Today-Tomorrow Program. The point system closely monitors and is highly responsive to changes in the youth's behavior. Through the point system, youth earn privileges for periods of positive behavior. Youth receive points at the end of the day based on their behavior and engagement in the treatment, and these points determine privileges for the following day. In addition to daily privileges, youth can earn additional, increasing privileges such as computer game time, snacks or private music, for accumulating points over several days. The Today-Tomorrow program incentivizes treatment compliance and appropriate behavior by rewarding pro-social behavior with increasingly desirable privileges. In addition to individual therapy guided by the decompression model and the Today-Tomorrow Program, MJTC further assists youth by providing educational services, and group based therapy covering topics such as anger management, substance abuse, social skills, and problem solving. MJTC is smaller and more intensive than standard juvenile corrections institutions. The original MJTC is about half the size of JCI units. Similarly, the ratio of clinical staff to residents is about twice that of more typical juvenile corrections units, allowing MJTC to provide much greater treatment resources to antisocial youth. Staff at MJTC consists of 1 psychiatrist on staff for every 28 youth, one psychologist for every 26 youth, one social worker for every 14 youth, and a psychiatric nurse. Each youth in MJTC participates in several weekly individual counseling sessions with a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker. The average length of time in treatment at MJTC ranges from 45 to 83 weeks. In standard juvenile correction institutions, mental health professionals are not assigned to specific JCI units. Experienced security staff, with little formal mental health training supervise units. The youth to psychologist ratios in standard JCI's is approximately 75 to 1. Psychiatric services typically occur in a clinic format by a part-time contracted psychiatrist. These part-time psychiatrists can have a caseload of up to 500 youth.  Efficacy  Research has found MJTC to be more efficacious at treating institutionalized youth than standard JCI rehabilitation programs. The program had the greatest impact on serious violent offenses, reducing the risk of their incidence by about half.Caldwell, M.F., Van Rybroek, G.J. (2005). Reducing violence in serious juvenile offenders using intensive treatment. Int J Law Psychiatry. 28(6):622-36. Youth in the treatment group were more than 6 times less likely to engage in felony violence than the comparison group youth, and had longer periods of time in the community before the first re-offense. Although their general recidivism rates were similar, only one fifth of the MJTC-treated youths were involved in institutional or community violence within 2 years after release, compared to approximately half of the comparison cases. Furthermore the length of treatment in MJTC significantly predicted improvement in interpersonal functioning and behavioral control.  Dissemination  The MJTC program has been adopted and adapted by four other sites, including adjudicated female youth, youth held for a short stay, and individuals committed under the Wisconsin Sexually Violent Persons Law. As of 2010, approximately 800 juveniles and 100 adults have been treated with MJTC. Due to the intensive nature of the program, and the high ratio of mental health professionals to youth, the costs of the MJTC program are more than double that of treatment as usual at standard JCI's. However, because participation in the program typically results in a shorter length of stay, overall correctional costs increase only 4.5%, or by approximately $7,000 per youth. Furthermore, the improved treatment progress and lowered recidivism, especially for the most violent crimes, suggests that while the initial costs of the treatment are higher, the long term costs of repeated and longer prison sentences, and physical and emotional harm to society may be far greater. In fact, one study reported that the MJTC treatment program yielded a benefit-cost ratio of more than 7 to 1 over treatment as usual. Implementation materials including training, support, and participant worksheets and handouts can be obtained from the developer. However, step-by-step implementation guidance is not provided. A criticism of the implementation materials for the MJTC program is that many of the participant handouts assume a high level of reading comprehension for youth.

It operated between Incheon and Jeju. On 16 April 2014, Sewol capsized and sank with the loss of 304 passengers and crew. Multiple documentaries have been made about this tragedy, ranging from The New Yorker to Asian Boss. Description Sewol was a RoPax ferry that was built by the Japanese company Hayashikane Shipbuilding & Engineering Co. Ltd. () in 1994. At in length and in width, she could carry 921 passengers, or a total of 956 persons, including the crew. She had a legal capacity for 180 vehicles and 154 regular cargo containers. The maximum speed of the ship was . Operations The ferry was originally known as Ferry Naminoue () between 1994 and 2012, and had been operated in Japan for almost 18 years without any accidents. In 2012, the ship was later bought for billion ( million) by Chonghaejin Marine Company, controlled by the family of businessman Yoo Byung-eun. The ship was renamed Sewol, and refurbished. Modifications included adding extra passenger cabins on the third, fourth, and fifth decks, raising the passenger capacity by 117, and increasing the weight of the ship by 239 tons. After regulatory and safety checks by the Korean Register of Shipping, the ship began her operation in South Korea on 15 March 2013. The ship made three round-trips every week from Incheon to Jeju. In February 2014 it was reported that Sewol again passed a vessel safety inspection by the South Korean Coast Guard following an intermediate survey to ensure the ship remained in a general condition which satisfied requirements set by the Korean Register of Shipping. Sinking On the evening of 15 April 2014, Sewol departed Incheon for a standard overnight crossing to Jeju Island. She was manned by a total of 33 crew and was carrying 443 passengers, 325 of whom were secondary students from Danwon High School in Ansan. The following morning, Sewol capsized and sank off Donggeochado, Jindo County, South Jeolla Province. Of the 476 people on board, there were only 172 survivors. 304 of those on board died, 250 of whom were Danwon students. The South Korea government's Board of Audit and Inspection revealed that the Korean Register's licensing was based on falsified documents. After the incident, the company reported that the ship was carrying 124 cars, 56 trucks, and 1157 tons of cargo. The amount of cargo carried was twice the legal limit. On 12 February 2015, Kim Kyung-il, the coastguard captain, was sentenced to four years in prison. Salvage In April 2015 a technical report concluded that it was feasible to raise the wreck of Sewol and President Park said she hoped that it would be carried out as soon as possible. Following the receipt of tenders from salvage companies, it was announced on 15 July 2015 that a consortium led by China's Shanghai Salvage Company was the favoured bidder, at a cost of 85.1 billion won (US$74.6 million). On 22 March 2017, salvage operation began to raise the wreck of sunken Sewol. The vessel was raised on 23 March. The wreck was moved onshore at Mokpo on 12 April. The vessel will be searched for the remains of the nine missing victims. While the lifted ferry was transported on board a semi-submersible vessel, its weight was estimated to be 17,000 tonnes, including the contribution of remaining mud inside. In terms of weight and number of axle-lines (600), it doubled the world record for a transport by SPMTs.ALE break SPMT world record during complex salvage ferry operation in South Korea ale-heavylift.com, 15 June 2017 (08:47), retrieved 20 December 2017. ‚Äì Remaining mud as 4.000 t extra weight.

Choo began his playing career playing as a right full-back with Singapore Chinese Football Association in the SAFA leagues in 1933. His performances led to a call-up to the Singapore FA team in the Malaya Cup competition. He was converted to a centre-half as the Lions won the Malaya Cup in 1937 and 1939. During World War II, he wrote propaganda for the British in Macau. In 1939, he helped to found the Chinese Athletic Association where he took on the role of player-coach.

The team toured Hong Kong in 1953, achieving wins over professional Hong Kong outfits. Choo was appointed Malaya national coach in 1958. He led the team to three Merdeka Tournament titles from 1958 to 1960. With Choo, Malaya also won the 1961 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games football competition and the bronze at the 1962 Asian Games. Choo left Malaysia and returned to Singapore in 1964. He was appointed Singapore national coach over four stints from 1964 to 1977. He won the Malaysia Cup in 1977, twelve years after Singapore's last triumph. His achievements earned him the 1977 Coach of the Year award. The following year, he was honoured with the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat medal for his services to Singapore football. Choo had a skin infection of his leg which he left untreated during the 1977 season. With diabetes as a complication, his condition worsened and he was forced to amputate his gangrenous right leg in September 1977. He returned to coaching during a brief stint with Johor FA in 1980 but left in early 1981. In June 1983, he was admitted to hospital with kidney problems. He died at the age of 68 on 30 June.  Early life  As a teenager, Choo would spurn his violin lessons to play football. This angered his elder brother that he ruined Choo's football kits and boots. His brother finally gave his approval and bought Choo a set of football equipment when he made Singapore's Malaya Cup squad. Choo received his education at Victoria Bridge School and Raffles Institution. He picked up football when he was studying for his Senior Cambridge certificate at Raffles Institution. He represented the school in the inter-school competition in 1930, playing as a right full-back. National player Lim Yong Liang began to mentor him after he was impressed by his ability.

Right after extending his contract, Choo departed on a six-month coaching course in England where he was attached to champions Burnley and other clubs like Everton, Sheffield United for the 1960‚Äì61 Football League season. The trip was made under a personal arrangement by FAM president Tunku Abdul RahmanTunku was also the Malayan Prime Minister. with a British Council bursary. Choo tendered his resignation as Malayan national coach in 1961 but was persuaded by Tunku to continue in his coaching position. Tunku declared that his resignation \\"will certainly be a calamity to the football fraternity of Malaya\\". At the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games in December 1961, Malaya defeated Burma 2‚Äì1 and Cambodia 4‚Äì0 to top their group. They advanced to the final by virtue of winning the coin toss after a 2‚Äì2 draw with Thailand in the semi-finals. Malaya scored two late goals in the final ten minutes to defeat hosts Burma 2‚Äì0 to win the football competition. Malaya opened their 1962 Asian Games campaign with a 15‚Äì1 win over the Philippines in the preliminary group stage. They finished second in the group and were drawn against South Korea in the semi-final, which they lost 2‚Äì1 after extra time. In the third-place play-off, Malaya defeated South Vietnam 4‚Äì1 to clinch the bronze medal. Choo's contract ended in March 1963 and was not renewed. He was appointed the national schools coach responsible for training and scouting youth players on 1 April. With the delay in the appointment of a new national coach, Choo was tasked by Tunku with coaching the MalaysiaThe country of Malaysia was formed through the merger of Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore on 16 September 1963. team from 10 September to prepare the players for the 1964 Olympics qualifiers and other upcoming tournaments. Choo left Malaysia at the end of the Merdeka Tournament in September 1964 after he felt he was under-utilised in his coaching capacity. Choo had also rejected coaching offers from Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia during his time with the FAM. = Singapore = The SAFA had rejected Choo's previous offers to coach the Singapore national team. Choo again indicated his availability to coach the team over his three months' leave from April 1964. The next month, SAFA put in a request to engage Choo's services in training Singapore FA for the Malaya Cup. Tunku Abdul Rahman, the Malaysian Prime Minister and President of the FAM, approved Choo's secondment to SAFA in June. Following a 1‚Äì1 draw, Singapore beat Hong Kong 2‚Äì1 in the replay to claim the Aw Hoe Cup in July.The Aw Hoe Cup was an annual competition between Singapore and Hong Kong. The next month, Singapore defeated Perak 3‚Äì2 in the final to clinch the 1964 Malaya Cup. Choo offered to coach Singapore in January 1965 and SAFA responded with a contract offer of $250 monthly wages plus a cut of the gate receipts in February which Choo accepted in March. Singapore retained the Malaya Cup in 1965, defeating Selangor 3‚Äì1 in the final. For the second consecutive year, Singapore won the Aw Hoe Cup after a replay. In December 1965, Singapore was eliminated at the group stage of the 1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games after losses to Burma and South Vietnam. On 28 December, the SAFA sacked Choo with immediate effect and dropped six players from national team due to alleged misconduct and insubordination at the 1965 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games. Team manager Tan Peng Yee had reported that Choo \\"was being difficult from the very moment the team arrived in Kuala Lumpur from Hong Kong\\". Choo was also charged with not following the manager's instructions and inciting resentment and undisciplined behaviour of the team in general. He offered to assist in coaching the national team in June 1966 but was rejected by the FASFormerly SAFA. which cited a lack of funds to pay his salary. Choo was one of three coaches appointed to coach the national team reserves in January 1967 and took full reins over the reserves in March. He returned as national coach on 8 August 1967, taking charge of the squad for the Merdeka Tournament in the same month. Singapore ended up last in the 10-team competition. Due to concerns expressed by Sports Minister Othman Wok that an inter-state competition is inappropriate for the national team, Singapore withdrew from the Malaysia CupThe Malaya Cup was renamed the Malaysia Cup in 1967. and FAM Cup in 1968 and 1969. In his time outside the national team set-up, Choo coached Police Sports Association from September 1968 and led them to the 1968 President's Cup. In June 1971, the National Sports Promotion BoardCaretakers of FAS pending election of new FAS council. assigned Choo to the national team coaching panel. Singapore was invited to the 12-nation Merdeka Tournament in August. The team defeated Hong Kong 2‚Äì1 and achieved a shock 1‚Äì0 win over pre-tournament favourites and 1970 Asian Games champions Burma. Singapore failed to make the semi-finals after a 4‚Äì4 draw with the Philippines. Choo later resigned in December due to poor health. In 1973, Choo rejected a coaching contract worth $2,800 per month, with first-class board and lodging, and free transport from professional Hong Kong club Caroline Hill FC. He accepted an $2,500 per month offer by the PSSI to coach the West Irian state team in December but resigned after two months. The FAS rejected Choo's application for national coach in September 1974. Between 1971 and 1975, Choo was also honorary coach of local clubs including Burnley United, Singapore Marble,Later renamed Toa Payoh United. Tampines Rovers, and Farrer Park. On 2 September 1976, Choo was appointed to coach Singapore for the preliminary World Cup tournament in February 1977 in his 4th stint with the FAS. His appointment prompted FAS advisor Trevor Hartley, coach Hussein Aljunied and trainer Andrew Yap to resign from the coaching panel although Hussein would return to assist Choo in late September. With the support of newly elected FAS chairman N. Ganesan, Choo was able to have non- interference in matchday selection of players for the first time. Singapore started the tournament with a 2‚Äì0 win over Thailand and a 2‚Äì2 draw with Hong Kong. They then defeated fancied Malaysia 1‚Äì0 to secure a play-off spot despite losing to Indonesia in the last group match. In the play-off match on 12 March, Singapore lost 1‚Äì0 to Hong Kong to eliminate their chances of reaching the final qualifying round. Choo had announced his intention to relinquish his position after the play-off due to his advanced age and a need to focus on his business. but eventually stayed on as national coach on a voluntary basis with performance-based payouts. In the 1977 Malaysia Cup, Singapore overcame defending champions Selangor 4‚Äì2 over two legs to advance to the final. Twelve years after its last triumph, Singapore defeated Penang 3‚Äì2 to win the Malaysia Cup on 28 May. Choo was praised for his tactical substitutes in the second half in which he replaced captain Samad Allapitchay and free-kick specialist S. Rajagopal with Lim Teng Sai and Nasir Jalil respectively. Following reported unhappiness of the players over the disparity in bonuses and mistreatment by the management leading to an alleged boycott of training, Choo rejected a one-year contract offer by the FAS and tendered his resignation on 27 June but withdrew it after talks with the FAS and the national players. Choo had developed a skin infection on his right leg after a fall sustained during the Malaysia Cup semi-final second leg against Selangor in May. He failed to seek treatment and with diabetes as a complication, gangrene set in. He had his lower right leg amputated in September. Following his operation, Choo was relieved of his duties as national coach. Despite the loss of his leg, Choo stated his intention to continue coaching. He returned to coaching with Malaysian outfit Johor FA midway through the 1980 season but left the team abruptly in January 1981.  Personal life  Choo and wife Margaret Boon Khin Siang had three children - son Boon Keng, Robert and daughters Geok Lan, Theresa and Geok Kim, Helen. Choo was the owner of the Maju Jaya Sports Store at Owen Road, Singapore. Choo had donated trophies made by his store for football competitions. Choo was a diabetic. He refused treatment for a leg infection leading into the 1977 Malaysia Cup final. His condition worsened and he had his gangrenous right lower leg amputated to the knee on 14 September 1977. As a result of spreading gangrene, a further amputation on his right upper leg was performed five days later. Choo's heart stopped thrice - during the first and second operations, and a third following internal bleeding.  Death  Choo was hospitalised with kidney problems in June 1983. On 30 June, he died at the age of 68 in his sleep at home. Over 1,500 fans attended his funeral wake and around 500 mourners were present at his burial. Players Edmund Wee, Quah Kim Song, Ho Kwang Hock, R. Suriamurthi, T. Pathmanathan were among the pallbearers.  Honours  Choo's performances in the preliminary World Cup tournament and the 1977 Malaysia Cup win earned him recognition with the 1977 SNOC Coach of the Year award. He was honoured with the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat medal in 1978 for his services to Singapore football. On 3 August 1982, he received a First Class gold medal from the PSSI for his contributions to Indonesian football. = Player = Singapore Chinese Football Association *SAFA First Division: 1937, 1938 *SAFA Second Division: 1934 *SAFA Third Division: 1933 *SAFA Challenge Cup: 1935, 1937, 1939 Singapore FA *Malaya Cup: 1937, 1939 References: = Coach = Star Soccerites *SAFA First Division: 1954 Marine Department Sports Club *SAFA First Division: 1957 Police SA *President's Cup: 1968 Singapore FA *Malaya Cup: 1964, 1965, 1977 *FAM Cup: 1967 Malaya *Merdeka Tournament: 1958, 1959, 1960 (shared) *Southeast Asian Peninsular Games: 1961 *Asian Games: Bronze medal ‚Äì 1962 = Individual = *SNOC Coach of the Year: 1977 = Civil = *Pingat Bakti Masyarakat: 1978  See also  *Kallang Roar the Movie ‚Äì A film on Choo Seng Quee and Singapore's Malaysia Cup win in 1977.

Hueman's best-known works include Bloom, a mural in the Los Angeles Arts District commemorating community advocate Joel Bloom, and the cover artwork for Pink‚Äôs 2019 record, Hurts 2B Human. As street art is a medium dominated by men, Hueman is noted as a female artist who has achieved significant renown.  Career  Hueman partnered with NYX Cosmetics in 2015 to create custom artwork for their products and storesHueman graduated from the University of California Los Angeles in 2008 with a degree in Design & Media Arts. After graduating, she worked as a freelance graphic designer and web designer. Early works by Hueman include a Nike-commissioned portrait of Kobe Bryant, a mural for P Diddy's Revolt TV office and Ritual, a 9-day, free-styled, floor-to-ceiling mural installation in a 5,000 sq foot warehouse space. In 2013, Hueman was one of the first artists commissioned to paint a mural after Los Angeles lifted its street art ban. In May 2014, Hueman was named one of LA Weekly's People of the Year and was featured on a limited-edition cover of the issue. In 2013, Hueman was featured in season 8, episode 27 of Pawn Stars ‚ÄúSay It, Don‚Äôt Spray It.‚Äù During the episode she is seen painting a mural of the main cast on the garage door of the Gold and Silver Pawn shop. The mural is still there today and is similar in design to Mount Rushmore. In 2015, she and artist Daniela Rocha curated Wander and Wayfare, which featured murals painted around San Francisco by eight female street artists, as well as a gallery art show. The event \\"will be an annual exhibition and mural festival that plans to brighten the future of the San Francisco art scene.\\" That July, she also participated in the second annual series of Sea Walls: Murals for Oceans, organized by PangeaSeed in Cozumel, Mexico. In 2019, Hueman was commissioned by filmmaker Ava Duvernay to paint the facade of her production company Array. Other projects include a painting at Hickory Alley in San Francisco, which is a large mural that spanned 5 buildings, titled Spray Ballet funded by the SF Community Challenge Grant, the design of a Nike shoe for the Olympics, a collaboration with Forever 21, and a refurbished basketball court for the Golden State Warriors at Salesian Boys & Girls Club, unveiled by Stephen Curry.

The Hungarian and Croatian attempt to halt the invasion at the Battle of Mohi failed catastrophically. The light cavalry that made up most of the Hungarian mounted forces had proven ineffective against the Mongol troops, though the few heavily armored knights (mostly those of the Knights Templar) performed significantly better when engaged in close quarters combat.Sugar, p.27: \\"The majority of the Hungarian forces consisted of light cavalry, who appeared 'oriental' to the Western observers. Yet this army had given up nomadic battle tactics and proved useless when facing the masters of this style of warfare. Hungarian tactics were a mix of eastern and western military traditions, as were the ineffective walls of clay bricks and palisades. Two elements of the Hungarian defense had proved effective, however: close combat with mass armored knights and stone fortifications\\". The Mongols decisively crushed the Hungarian army, and proceeded to ravage the countryside for the next year. By the end of their campaign, around a quarter of the population of Hungary had been killed, and most of the kingdom's major settlements had been reduced to rubble.Sugar, p.27: \\"In the plains, between 50 and 80 percent of the settlements were destroyed. In forested areas, in the mountains, and in Transylvania, the demographic loss is estimated at 25-30 percent\\". The wooden, clay, and earthJackon, p. 65 defenses that made up the walls of most towns and forts fell easily to the Mongol siege engines.Sugar, p. 26: \\"The country centers, lacking defenses, and the residences of [nobles], protected at best by moats, fences, and wooden towers, were no obstacle. Using ballistas, the Mongols leveled the forts, and put the settlements to the torch\\". Many Hungarian settlements didn't have any fortifications at all. One German chronicler observed that the Hungarians \\"had almost no city protected by walls or strong fortresses\\".Jackson, p. 66 However, stone castles had significantly better fortunes; none of the few Hungarian stone castles fell, even those deep behind the Mongol lines. When the Mongols tried to use their siege engines on the stone walls of the Croatian Fortress of Klis, they did absolutely no damage, and were repelled with heavy casualties.Kosztolnyik, p. 174 A similar thing happened when they attempted to capture the citadel of Esztergom, despite having overwhelming numerical superiority and 30 siege machines which they had just used to reduce the wooden towers of the city.Pow, p. 72, 132, =Military reforms= Mongol invasion in the 13th century led to construction of mighty stone castles, such as Spi≈° Castle (), today in Slovakia. King B√©la IV took note of this, and spent the next few decades reforming Hungary in preparation for possible future invasions. He used a variety of methods to do this. First and foremost, he amalgamated the servientes and iobagiones castri into a new class of heavily armored, well-trained knights of the western type, where previously Hungary's defenses had relied almost entirely on wooden castles and light cavalry.Ertman, Thomas. \\"Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe.\\" Cambridge University Press (January 13, 1997). Page 273. In 1247 he concluded a feudal agreement with the Knights of St. John, giving them the southeastern borderland in exchange for their help in creating more armored cavalry and fortifications. In 1248, he declared the country's middle strata could enter a baron's service, on the condition that the barons lead the men on his land properly equipped (in armor) into the king's army. Documents from the time state that \\"the nobles of our country can enter into military service of bishops in the same way in which they can serve other nobles\\". After 1250, free owners of small or middle sized estates serving directly under the king were included (along with barons) in the nobility. Finally, new settlers were given \\"conditional\\" nobility in exchange for the requirement of fighting mounted and armored at the king's request.Sugar, p. 28-29 In 1259, he requested that the Pope put him into contact with Venice, as he wanted to hire at least 1,000 crossbowmen (crossbows having also proven a very effective weapon against the Mongols, despite the relatively small numbers of them actually deployed by the Hungarians in 1241).Jackson, p, 71 and 84 To cement his new defense doctrine, the king offered grants and rewards to cities and nobles in exchange for the building of stone fortifications. The reforms ultimately paid off. By the end of his reign, B√©la IV had overseen the building of nearly 100 new fortresses. Of these 100, 66 were stone castles built on elevated sites.Pow, p. 76: \\"[B√©la] showed moral courage in reversing his autocratic policies and granting numerous privileges to nobles on the condition that they build stone castles. Before this time, castle building was purely the business of the Hungarian monarchy. B√©la's energetic policies saw the construction off 66 'new-style' castles during his reign. All of them were built of stone and situated on an elevated sight\\". This was a major upgrade from 1241, when the kingdom only possessed 10 stone castles, half of which were placed along the border with the Duchy of Austria.Pow, p. 59 =Lead-up to the second invasion= Kingdom of Hungary in the second half of the 13th century In 1254, Batu Khan demanded a marriage alliance with Hungary and a quarter of its army for a drive into central and western Europe. In exchange, Hungary would be spared from tribute obligations and any further destruction. B√©la ignored the message. Additional ultimatums were sent in 1259 and 1264, this time by Batu's brother and successor, Berke Khan. Berke made similar demands: if Hungary would submit to the Mongols and grant them a quarter of its army for the planned invasion of Europe, it would receive tax exemption and 1/5 of the plunder. Again, B√©la refused.Pow, p. 29-30Jean W. Sedlar, East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000‚Äì1500 (Seattle: University of Washington Press), 379. Letters exchanged between B√©la and the Pope circa 1259 imply that the Mongols had been well known to be untrustworthy for decades, with the Pope saying that any agreements made by the \\"perfidious\\" conquerors were worthless.Bezzola, Die Mongolen, 188. After the deaths of the kings B√©la IV and Stephen V, Ladislaus IV assumed the Hungarian throne in 1272. Under the maternal influence, he became known as the Ladislaus the Cuman. In the next years, his resistance against the nobles and clerics became stronger, to the point that he arrested a papal legate over a law requiring the pagan Cumans convert to Christianity and imprisoned his Christian wife, Isabel of Anjou. The barons raised an army and Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom declared a crusade against the Hungarian king.Chambers, p. 164 However, when the Cumans rebelled and invaded Hungary in 1282, Ladislaus and his nobles did not hesitate to crush the rebellion. The Illuminated Chronicle writes that Ladislaus, \\"like the brave Joshua, went out against\\" the Cumans \\"to fight for his people and his realm,\\" defeating the Cuman army at Lake H√≥d, near H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely.Salagean, p. 133 Despite this, the king's reputation especially among his nobles remained very poor. In 1283 he settled among his Cuman subjects after abandoning his wife, and took Cuman women as his mistresses. The 1282 Cuman rebellion may have catalyzed the Mongol invasion. Cuman warriors driven out of Hungary offered their services to Nogai Khan, de facto head of the Golden Horde, and told him about the perilous political situation in Hungary. Seeing this as an opportunity, Nogai decided to start a vast campaign against the apparently weak kingdom.Salagean, p. 135 Invasion = Forces = In the winter of 1285, Mongol armies invaded Hungary for a second time. As in the first invasion in 1241, Mongols invaded Hungary in two fronts. Nogai invaded via Transylvania, while Talabuga invaded via Transcarpathia and Moravia. A third, smaller force likely entered the center of the kingdom, mirroring Kadan's earlier route. The invasion paths seemed to mirror those taken by Batu and Subutai 40 years earlier, with Talabuga going through Verecke Pass and Nogai going through Brass√≥ to enter Transylvania.Salagean, p. 135 Much like the first invasion, the Mongols emphasized speed and surprise and intended to destroy the Hungarian forces in detail, invading in winter for hope of catching the Hungarians off guard and moving fast enough that it was impossible (at least until their later setbacks) for Ladislaus to gather enough men to engage them in a decisive confrontation.Salagean, p. 136 Because of the lack of civil war in the Mongol Empire at the time, as well as the lack of any other major conflicts involving the Golden Horde, Nogai was able to field a very large army for this invasion,Jackson, p. 199 with the Galician-Volhynian Chronicle describing it as \\"a great host\\"Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 95. but its exact size isn't certain. It is known that the Mongol host included cavalry from their vassals, the Ruthenian princes, including Lev Daniilovich and others from among their Rus‚Ä≤ satellites.Jackon, p. 205 Stefan Kraowski indirectly places the Mongol invasion force a fair bit above 30,000 men by estimating the smaller Mongol invasion of Poland two years later as having about that many soldiers, stating that Nogai and Talabuga personally leading an invasion suggests it is a massive force by definition.Krakowski, p. 212 Peter Jackson, using contemporary Hungarian charters, concludes that the Mongol army was very large, but is unsure if it was larger, smaller, or comparable in size to the 1241‚Äì42 invasion force.Jackson, p. 205: \\"Even though figures given by German analysts smack of hyperbole, the language of the Hungarian charters certainly indicates that the numbers involved were considerable\\". A contemporary letter from Benedict, the provost of Esztergom, estimates the size of the Mongol army at 200,000. This is almost certainly an enormous exaggeration, as the Mongols almost never fielded armies larger than 100,000 men.Jackson, p. 225 The Austrian chronicler of Salzburg recorded that the Mongol military camp covered an area of in width and in depth (whether this was Nogai's or Talabuga's army, or how this chronicler got his information, is unknown).Kosztolnyik, p. 286 The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle puts the size of the Mongol army in the hundreds of thousands, saying that Talabuga's column alone lost 100,000 men during the march through the Carpathians.Perfecky, George A. (1973). The Galician-Volynian Chronicle. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. Page 96. In 1255, William of Rubruck wrote that the Hungarians could gather at most 30,000 soldiers, a situation that probably hadn't drastically changed in the last three decades.William of Rubruck. \\"The journey of William of Rubruck to the eastern parts of the world, 1253-55.\\" Translated by William Woodville Rockhill. Page 281. \\"It would be very easy to conquer or to pass through all these countries. The King of Hungary has not at most XXX thousand soldiers.\\" It is unknown how many of these men were mustered during the period of the Mongol invasion. = Central/Northern Hungary, Transcarpathia, and Western Transylvania = Talabuga, who led the main army in Northern Hungary, was stopped by the heavy snow of the Carpathians. On the march up, his force was devastated by logistical factors, namely a shortage of food which caused the deaths of thousands of his soldiers, as attested to by the Galician-Volynian Chronicle and certain contemporary Polish sources.Pow, p. 28 This was likely the result of the traditional tactics of castle warfare, which involve starving out the invaders by hoarding all available food stocks, while launching small raids and sallies from the castles. Polish chroniclers hostile to the Hungarian king stated that Ladislaus was too cowardly to face the Mongols in a straight battle, very likely a misinterpretation of successful battle avoidance and scorched earth tactics.Hans-Hemming Kortum. \\"Transcultural Wars: from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century\\". Akademie Verlag (March 22, 2006). Page 227. Footnote 68. At the beginning of the campaign the invading force devastated central Hungary and entered the town of Pest. They burned it, but the town had long since been abandoned by its population, who fled south and west of the Danube.Kosztolnyik, p. 286 During this event, members of Queen Elizabeth's household launched a spirited and effective sally against the Mongols, while she watched from the safety of the walls of Buda.Jackson, p. 205 Talabuga's forces encountered great difficulties with the density of fortifications and failed to capture any castles or fortified cities.Salagean, p. 136 However, they caused major damage to the civilian population, and raided as far as the Danube. Local Hungarian forces fought the Mongols in many defensive battles, for which the king had promoted several lesser officials who had distinguished themselves, including George Baksa, Amadeus Aba his relative, Peter Aba from the clan's Somos branch.Kosztolnyik, p. 285 One such battle took place near the castle of Turusko (Trascau), where the Mongols suffered a sharp defeat with heavy casualties, including 1,000 taken prisoner.Henry Hoyle Howorth. \\"History of the Mongols from the 9th to the 19th Century\\". COSIMO CLASSICS, 2013. Originally published 1876. Page 1,014. Talabuga's weakened army was ultimately defeatedEngel, p. 109 when met head-on in battle by the hastily assembled royal army of Ladislaus IV, in the hills of western Transylvania.Kosztolnyik, p. 286 The army had benefited from the reforms and had a higher proportion of knights than the army the Mongols had defeated a few decades earlier at Mohi. After the defeat, Talabuga ordered a retreat from Hungary, but his army was ambushed on the return by the Sz√©kely people, who fought as light cavalry. By the time he made it back to friendly territory, his army had effectively ceased to exist, with the majority of the soldiers he brought dying in the failed raid.Jackson, p. 209: \\"The Volynian Chronicle has [Talabuga] arrive back with few survivors of his original force after crossing the Carpathians\\". By the hyperbole of one chronicler, Talabuga arrived back in Ruthenia with only his wife and one horse. Once he finally reached Volynia, his starving soldiers plundered the towns of his allies and vassals.Chambers, p. 165 = Transylvania and the Hungarian Plains = Nogai stayed in Transylvania until the spring of 1286. Here he plundered some towns and villages, such as Sz√°szr√©gen (Reghin), Brass√≥ (Bra≈üov) and Beszterce (Bistri»õa). He also managed to destroy a few forts and walled towns. However, like Talabuga, he failed to take any major fortifications, with the exception of the Saxon castle of Ban Mikod in the Aranyos Valley, the former royal stronghold of Torda (today Turda, Romania).Salagean, p. 136Pow, p. 77: \\"They accomplished very little in terms of taking fortified places, and met with defeat in Transylvania\\" After the defeat of Talabuga's main column, King Ladislaus IV led an expedition to expel Nogai's forces from Transylvania. His army arrived too late to make a significant difference, as Nogai's forces had already suffered a serious defeat at the hands of local Hungarian troops--mostly the Saxons, Vlachs, and Sz√©kelys, commanded by Voivode Roland Borsa.Jackson, p. 205: \\"According to a contemporary letter and reports that reached Germany, it was the local troops --Saxons, Vlachs, and Sz√©kely, with the last fighting as light cavalry--who cut off [the Mongols'] retreat in Transylvania and inflicted on them a serious reverse.\\" Ladislaus settled for harassing their withdrawal. Aftermath The results of the invasion could not have contrasted more sharply with those of the 1241 invasion. The invasion was repelled handily, and the Mongols lost much of their invading force due to several months of starvation, numerous small raids, and two major military defeats. This was mostly thanks to the new fortification network and the military reforms. No major invasion of Hungary would be launched after the failure of the campaign of 1285, though small raids from the Golden Horde were frequent well into the 14th century. Less than two years later, the Third Mongol invasion of Poland occurred. This invasion was also repulsed, with the Poles using a similar strategy to the Hungarians in 1285. They were aided by a Hungarian force under George Baksa (also known as George of S√≥v√°r).Krakowski, p. 217-218. It was probably in reprisal for this event that in late 1288, a Mongol force launched an attack on the Szepes (Spi≈°) region, albeit on a small scale. They were repelled, with George again distinguishing himself.Jackson, p. 205 While a victory for Hungary overall (albeit with heavy civilian casualties), the war was a political disaster for the king. Like his grandfather before him, many nobles accused him of inviting the Mongols into his lands, due to his perceived ties to the Cumans.Salagean, p. 137 Possibly more disastrously, the invasion was fended off by local barons and other magnates with little help from the king. After proving their military skills, the efficiency of their fortifications and armed forces, and their ability to ensure the safety of their subjects to a greater degree than the king or his dignitaries, various local elites expanded their net of supporters and deemed themselves entitled to rule large regions of the kingdom. The crisis brought to light the king's lack of significant military resources and inability to compensate for such via political skills.Salagean, p. 138 The heavy losses suffered by the Mongols in this war, combined with their defeat in Poland shortly after (though they did successfully re-vassalize Bulgaria between these expeditions), contributed to the lack of major Golden Horde operations in central Europe outside of the 1280s. From then on, Mongol attacks on Hungary and Transylvania would be limited to raids and pillaging along the frontier lines.Salagean, 137 By the 14th century, the Golden Horde and much of the Mongolian Empire posed no serious threats thereafter to Hungary, despite frontier raids continuing under √ñz Beg Khan. In fact, in 1345, a Hungarian army under Count Andrew Lackfi took the initiative and launched an invasion force into Mongolian territory, defeating a Golden Horde force and capturing what would become Moldavia.Kort√ºm, Hans-Henning.

Several expansions of populations of archaic humans (genus Homo) out of Africa and throughout Eurasia took place in the course of the Lower Paleolithic, and into the beginning Middle Paleolithic, between about 2.1 million and 0.2 million years ago (Ma). These expansions are collectively known as Out of Africa I, in contrast to the expansion of Homo sapiens (anatomically modern humans) into Eurasia, which may have begun shortly after 0.2 million years ago (known in this context as \\"Out of Africa II\\").The term \\"Out of Africa I\\" is informal and somewhat rare. The phrase Out of Africa used on its own generally refers to \\"Out of Africa II\\", the expansion of anatomically modern humans into Eurasia. \\"Out of Africa I\\" is used in 2004, in Marco Langbroek, 'Out of Africa': an investigation into the earliest occupation of the Old World, p. 61, and as the title of a collection of essays, J. G. Fleagle et al. (eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia (2010). see also: ; The earliest presence of Homo (or indeed any hominin) outside of Africa dates to close to 2 million years ago. A 2018 study claims human presence at Shangchen, central China, as early as 2.12 Ma based on magnetostratigraphic dating of the lowest layer containing stone artefacts. \\"Eight major magnetozones are recorded in the Shangchen section, four of which have normal polarity (N1 to N4) and four of which have reversed polarity (R1 to R4). By comparison with the geomagnetic polarity timescale [...] magnetozone N4 corresponds to the R√©union excursion (2.13‚Äì2.15 Ma) in L28.\\" The oldest known human skeletal remains outside of Africa are from Dmanisi, Georgia (Dmanisi skull 4), and are dated to 1.8 Ma. These remains are classified as Homo erectus georgicus. Later waves of expansion are proposed around 1.4 Ma (early Acheulean industries), associated with Homo antecessor and 0.8 Ma (cleaver-producing Acheulean groups, associated with Homo heidelbergensis). Until the early 1980s, early humans were thought to have been restricted to the African continent in the Early Pleistocene, or until about 0.8 Ma; Hominin migrations outside East Africa were apparently rare in the Early Pleistocene, leaving a fragmentary record of events.

Kieser (Atelier WILD LIFE ART); see Westfalen in der Alt- und Mittelsteinzeit, Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe, M√ºnster (2013), fig. 42. Pre-Homo hominin expansion out of Africa is suggested by the presence of Graecopithecus and Ouranopithecus, found in Greece and Anatolia and dated to c. 8 million years ago, but these are probably Homininae but not Hominini. Possibly related are the Trachilos footprints found in Crete, dated to close to 6 million years ago. Australopithecina emerge about 5.6 million years ago, in East Africa (Afar Depression). Gracile australopithecines (Australopithecus afarensis) emerge in the same region, around 4 million years ago. The earliest known retouched tools were found in Lomekwi, Kenya, and date back to 3.3 Ma, in the late Pliocene. They might be the product of Australopithecus garhi or Paranthropus aethiopicus, the two known hominins contemporary with the tools. Genus Homo is assumed to have emerged by around 2.8 million years ago, with Homo habilis being found at Lake Turkana, Kenya. The delineation of the \\"human\\" genus, Homo, from Australopithecus is somewhat contentious, for which reason the superordinate term \\"hominin\\" is often used to include both. \\"Hominin\\" technically includes chimpanzees as well as pre-human species as old as 10 million years ago (the separation of Homininae into Hominini and Gorillini). The earliest known hominin presence outside of Africa, dates to close to 2 million years ago. A 2018 study claims evidence for human presence at Shangchen, central China, as early as 2.12 Ma based on magnetostratigraphic dating of the lowest layer containing stone artefacts. It has been suggested that Homo floresiensis was descended from such an early expansion. It is not clear whether these earliest hominins leaving Africa should be considered Homo habilis, or a form of early Homo or late Australopithecus closely related to Homo habilis, or a very early form of Homo erectus. In any case, the morphology of H. floresiensis has been found to show greatest similarity with Australopithecus sediba, Homo habilis and Dmanisi Man, raising the possibility that the ancestors of H. floresiensis left Africa before the appearance of H. erectus. A phylogenetic analysis published in 2017 suggests that H. floresiensis was descended from a species (presumably Australopithecine) ancestral to Homo habilis, making it a \\"sister species\\" either to H. habilis or to a minimally habilis-erectus-ergaster-sapiens clade, and its line is older than H. erectus itself. On the basis of this classification, H. floresiensis is hypothesized to represent a hitherto unknown and very early migration out of Africa, dating to before 2.1 million years ago. A similar conclusion is suggested by the date of 2.1 Ma for the oldest Shangchen artefacts. Homo erectus Map of the distribution of Middle Pleistocene (Acheulean) cleaver finds Forensic reconstruction of an adult male Homo erectus.Reconstruction by W. Schnaubelt & N. Kieser (Atelier WILD LIFE ART), 2006, Westf√§lisches Museum f√ºr Arch√§ologie, Herne, Germany. Homo erectus emerges just after 2 million years ago. Early H. erectus would have lived face to face with H. habilis in East Africa for nearly half a million years. The oldest Homo erectus fossils appear almost contemporaneously, shortly after two million years ago, both in Africa and in the Caucasus. The earliest well-dated Eurasian H. erectus site is Dmanisi in Georgia, securely dated to 1.8 Ma.1.85-1.78 Ma 95% CI. A skull found at Dmanisi is evidence for caring for the old. The skull shows that this Homo erectus was advanced in age and had lost all but one tooth years before death, and it is perhaps unlikely that this hominid would have survived alone. It is not certain, however, that this is sufficient proof for caring ‚Äì a partially paralysed chimpanzee at the Gombe reserve survived for years without help. The earliest known evidence for African H. erectus, dubbed Homo ergaster, is a single occipital bone (KNM-ER 2598), described as \\"H. erectus-like\\", and dated to about 1.9 Ma (contemporary with Homo rudolfensis). This is followed by a fossil gap, the next available fossil being KNM-ER 3733, a skull dated to 1.6 Ma. Early Pleistocene sites in North Africa, the geographical intermediate of East Africa and Georgia, are in poor stratigraphic context. The earliest of the dated is Ain Hanech in northern Algeria (c. 1.8 ‚Äì 1.2 Ma), an Oldowan grade layer. These sites attest that early Homo erectus have crossed the North African tracts, which are usually hot and dry. There is little time between Homo erectus‚Äô apparent arrival in South Caucasus around 1.8 Ma, and its probable arrival in East and Southeast Asia. There is evidence of H. erectus in Yuanmou, China, dating to 1.7 Ma and in Sangiran, on Java, Indonesia, from 1.66 Ma. Ferring et al. (2011) suggest that it was still Homo habilis that reached West Asia, and that early H. erectus developed there. H. erectus would then have dispersed from West Asia, to East Asia (Peking Man) Southeast Asia (Java Man), back to Africa (Homo ergaster), and to Europe (Tautavel Man). It appears H. erectus took longer to move into Europe, the earliest site being Barranco Le√≥n in southeastern Spain dated to 1.4 Ma, associated with Homo antecessor, and a controversial Pirro Nord in Southern Italy, allegedly from 1.7 ‚Äì 1.3 Ma. The paleobiogeography of early human dispersals in western Eurasia characterizes H. ex gr. erectus as a temperature sensitive stenobiont, that failed to disperse north of the Alpide Belt. The geographically restricted earliest human presence in the Iberian Peninsula should be regarded as evidence of a sustainable presence of human population in this isolated area. The Pannonian plain, situated south-west of the Carpathian Mountains, was apparently characterized by a comparatively warm climate similar to that of the Mediterranean Area, while the climate of the western European paleobiogeographic area was mitigated by Gulf Stream influence and could support the episodic hominin dispersals toward the Iberian Peninsula. Apparently, the faunal exchanges between southeastern Europe and the Near East and southern Asia were controlled by the complex interaction of such geographic obstacles as the Bosporus and the Manych Strait, the climate barrier from the north of the Greater Caucasus range, and the 41 kyr glacial Milankovitch cycles that repeatedly closed the Bosporus and thus triggered the two-way faunal exchange between southeastern Europe and the Near East, and, apparently, the further westward dispersal of the archaic hominins in Eurasia. By 1 Ma, Homo erectus had spread across Eurasia (mostly restricted to latitudes south of the 50th parallel norththe northernmost known Middle Pleistocene site is Whithlingham, at 52.6¬∞ N. Mourre, V., Implications culturelles de la technologie des hachereaux, doctoral thesis, Universit√© de Paris X - Nanterre (2003) Fig. 48 (p. 115).). It is hard to say, however, whether settlement was continuous in Western Europe, or if successive waves repopulated the territory in glacial interludes. Early Acheulean tools at Ubeidiya from 1.4 Ma is some evidence for a continuous settlement in the West, as successive waves out of Africa after then would likely have brought Acheulean technology to Western Europe. The presence of Lower Paleolithic human remains in Indonesian islands is good evidence for seafaring by Homo erectus late in the Early Pleistocene. Bednarik suggests that navigation had appeared by 1 Ma, possibly to exploit offshore fishing grounds. He has reproduced a primitive dirigible (steerable) raft to demonstrate the feasibility of faring across the Lombok Strait on such a device, which he believes to have been done before 850 ka. The strait has maintained a width of at least 20 km for the whole of the Pleistocene. Such an achievement by Homo erectus in the Early Pleistocene offers some strength to the suggested water routes out of Africa, as the Gibraltar, Sicilian, and Bab-el-Mandeb exit routes are harder to consider if watercraft are deemed beyond the capacities of Homo erectus. Homo heidelbergensis Forensic interpretation of an adult male Homo rhodesiensis based on the Kabwe skull. Archaic humans in Europe beginning about 0.8 Ma (cleaver-producing Acheulean groups) are classified as a separate, erectus-derived species, known as Homo heidelbergensis. H. heidelbergensis from about 0.4 Ma develops its own characteristic industry, known as Clactonian. H. heidelbergensis is closely related to Homo rhodesiensis (also identified as Homo heidelbergensis sensu lato or African H. heidelbergensis), known to be present in southern Africa by 0.3 Ma. Homo sapiens emerges in Africa before about 0.3 Ma from a lineage closely related to early H. heidelbergensis. The first wave of \\"Out of Africa II and \\"earliest presence of H. sapiens in West Asia, may date to between .3 and 0.2 Ma, and ascertained for 0.13 Ma. Genetic research also indicates that a later migration wave of H. sapiens (from .07-.05 Ma) from Africa is responsible for all to most of the ancestry of current non-African populations. Routes out of Africa Most attention as to the route taken from Africa to West Asia is given to the Levantine land corridor and the Bab-el-Mandeb straits. The latter connects the Horn of Africa and Arabia, and may have allowed dry passage during some periods of the Pleistocene. Another candidate is the Strait of Gibraltar. A route across the Strait of Sicily was suggested in the 1970s but is now considered unlikely. =Levantine corridor= The use by hominins of the Levantine corridor, connecting Egypt via the Sinai peninsula with the Eastern Mediterranean, has been associated to the phenomenon of rising and declining humidity of the desert belt of northern Africa, known as the Sahara pump. The numerous hominin sites in the Levant, such as Ubeidiya and Misliya cave, are used as indicators of this migration route. As of 2012, the genetic analysis of human populations in Africa and Eurasia supports the concept that during the Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, this route was more important for bi-directional human migrations between Africa and Eurasia than was the Horn of Africa.J. R. Luis et al., \\"The Levant versus the Horn of Africa: Evidence for Bidirectional Corridors of Human Migrations\\" , American Journal of Human Genetics, 74: 532-544. =Horn of Africa to Arabia (Bab el-Mandeb)= Bab-el-Mandeb strait Bab-el-Mandeb is a 30 km strait between East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, with a small island, Perim, 3 km off the Arabian bank. The strait has a major appeal in the study of Eurasian expansion in that it brings East Africa in direct proximity with Eurasia. It does not require hopping from one water body to the next across the North African desert. The land connection with Arabia disappeared in the Pliocene, and though it may have briefly reformed, the evaporation of the Red Sea and associated increase in salinity would have left traces in the fossil record after just 200 years and evaporite deposits after 600 years. Neither have been detected. A strong current flows from the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean and crossing would have been difficult without a land connection. Oldowan grade tools are reported from Perim Island,Chauhan, P. R. (2009). \\"Early Homo Occupation Near the Gate of Tears: Examining the Paleoanthropological Records of Djibouti and Yemen\\", in: E. Hover and D.R. Braun (Eds.) Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Oldowan, Springer Netherlands, 49‚Äì59. implying that the strait could have been crossed in the Early Pleistocene, but these finds have yet to be confirmed. =Strait of Gibraltar= The Strait of Gibraltar is the Atlantic entryway to the Mediterranean, where Spanish and Moroccan banks are only 14 km apart. A decrease in sea levels in the Pleistocene due to glaciation would not have brought this down to less than 10 km. Deep currents push westwards, and surface water flows strongly back into the Mediterranean. Entrance into Eurasia across the strait of Gibraltar could explain the hominin remains at Barranco Le√≥n in southeastern Spain (1.4 Ma) and Sima del Elefante in northern Spain (1.2 Ma). But the site of Pirro Nord in southern Italy, allegedly from 1.3 ‚Äì 1.7 Ma, suggests a possible arrival from the East. Resolution is insufficient to settle the matter. =Strait of Sicily= Passage across the Strait of Sicily was suggested by Alimen (1975)Alimen, H. (1975). \\"Les 'Isthmes' hispano-marocain et Sicilo-Tunisien aux temps Acheul√©ens\\". L'Anthropologie, 79, 399‚Äì436. based on the 1973 discovery of Oldowan grade tools in Sicily.Bianchini, G. (1973). \\"Gli 'hacheraux' nei giacimenti paleolitici della Sicilia sud occidentale\\". Proceedings of the XV Scientific Meeting of the Italian Institute of Prehistory and Protohistory, 11‚Äì25 October 1972. Radiometric dates, however, have not been produced, and the artefacts might as well be from the Middle Pleistocene, and it is unlikely that there was a land bridge during the Pleistocene. Causes for dispersal =Climate change and hominin flexibility= For a given species in a given environment, available resources will limit the number of individuals that can survive indefinitely. This is the carrying capacity. Upon reaching this threshold, individuals may find it easier to gather resources in the poorer yet less exploited peripheral environment than in the preferred habitat. Homo habilis could have developed some baseline behavioural flexibility prior to its expansion into the peripheries (such as encroaching into the predatory guildLewis, M. E., & Werdelin, L. (2007). \\"Patterns of change in the Plio- Pleistocene carnivorans of eastern Africa: Implications for hominin Evolution\\". In R. Bobe, Z. Alemseged, & A. K. Behrensmeyer (Eds.), Hominin environments in the East African Pliocene: An assessment of the faunal evidence. Springer, 77‚Äì106.). This flexibility could then have been positively selected and amplified, leading to Homo erectus adaptation to the peripheral open habitats. A new and environmentally flexible hominin population could have come back to the old niche and replaced the ancestral population. Moreover, some step-wise shrinking of the woodland and the associated reduction of hominin carrying capacity in the woods around 1.8 Ma, 1.2 Ma, and 0.6 Ma would have stressed the carrying capacity's pressure for adapting to the open grounds. With Homo erectus new environmental flexibility, favourable climate fluxes likely opened it the way to the Levantine corridor, perhaps sporadically, in the Early Pleistocene. =Chasing fauna= Lithic analysis implies that Oldowan hominins were not predators.Shipman, P. A. T. (1984). Hunting in Early Hominids: Theoretical Framework and Tests, 27‚Äì43. However, Homo erectus appears to have followed animal migrations to the north during wetter periods, likely as a source of scavenged food. The sabre-tooth cat Megantereon was an apex predator of the Early and Middle Pleistocene (before MIS 12). It became extinct in Africa c. 1.5 Ma, but had already moved out through the Sinai, and is among the faunal remains of the Levantine hominin site of Ubeidiya, c. 1.4 Ma. It could not break bone marrow and its kills were likely an important food source for hominins,Lewis, M.E., Werdelin, L. (2010). \\"Carnivoran Dispersal Out of Africa During the Early Pleistocene: Relevance for Hominins?\\". In: A. Baden et al. (Eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia. Springer Netherlands, pp. 13-26. especially in glacial periods. In colder Eurasian times, the hominin diet would have to be principally meat-based and Acheulean hunters must have competed with cats. =Coevolved zoonotic diseases= Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen suggest that the success of hominins within Eurasia once out of Africa is in part due to the absence of zoonotic diseases outside their original habitat. Zoonotic diseases are those that are transmitted from animals to humans. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, zoonotic diseases will not necessarily do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. Still, these infections are well accustomed to human presence, having evolved alongside them. The higher an African ape's population density, the better a disease fares. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them zoonotic.Goodall, J., (1986). The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. The majority of these diseases are still restricted to hot and damp African environments. Once hominins had moved out into drier and colder habitats of higher latitudes, one major limiting factor in population growth was out of the equation. =Physiological traits= While Homo habilis was certainly bipedal, its long arms are indicative of an arboreal adaptation. Homo erectus had longer legs and shorter arms, revealing a transition to obligate terrestriality, though it remains unclear how this change in relative leg length might have been an advantage. Sheer body size, on the other hand, seems to have allowed for better walking energy efficiency and endurance. A larger Homo erectus would also dehydrate more slowly and could thus cover greater distances before facing thermoregulatory limitations. The ability for prolonged walking at a normal pace would have been a decisive factor for effective colonisation of Eurasia.Klein, R. G. (1999).

It is the capital‚Äôs second oldest hotel after the Hotel Bristol, Warsaw. Together with the adjacent Metropol Hotel and the MDM Hotel, it is managed by the Syrena Hotel Group. It was declared an architectural monument of Poland's history and culture on July 1, 1965.  History  =Prewar= The Polonia Palace Hotel was developed by Count Konstanty Przedziecki, a member of one of Poland's oldest aristocratic families,Louis Gerber, Polonia Palace Hotel History, photos and review at Cosmopolis.ch, January 17, 2014. whose grandfather Aleksander had constructed the nearby Hotel Europejski. The name Polonia Palace was chosen during the Period of Partition to have a strong patriotic element. The hotel had a Parisian design with a mansard roof, a structure in the Beaux Arts style designed by Juliusz Nag√≥rski, and interiors in the Louis XVI style designed by J√≥zef Holewi≈Ñski. It opened on July 14, 1913 and featured hot and cold running water and dial telephones in each of 160 rooms, though only six rooms had private bathrooms. It also included an attached garage, men's and ladies' hair salons, an extensive wine cellar and a laundry on-site. The hotel was located across from the Vienna Station, until that building was demolished in 1919. Later it was across from the new Warsaw Central Station, which was ultimately destroyed in World War II. Advertisement from 1927 The hotel was expanded in 1924, with a new wing that included a dancehall where Rolf Roy, a well-known Viennese dancer, was appointed as its artistic manager. In 1925, a ball of dramatists and playwrights was held at the hotel, attended by such artists as Jan Lecho≈Ñ, Stefan ≈ªeromski, Ludwik Solski, Kornel Makuszy≈Ñski, Maria Pawlikowska, J√≥zef Wƒôgrzyn and Tadeusz Boy-≈ªele≈Ñski. In 1927, the painter Kazimir Malevich held his first foreign exhibition outside the Soviet Union at the hotel. King Amanullah Khan of Afghanistan visited the hotel in 1929, when officials of the Second Republic of Poland honored him with the Order of the White Eagle. The author of ‚ÄòFlirt z MelpomenƒÖ‚Äô (Flirting with Melpomena) and ‚ÄòPiek≈Ço kobiet‚Äô (Women‚Äôs Hell) celebrated his jubilee, organized by the PEN Club, at the hotel. Jan Kiepura performed at the hotel. The Polish Arts Club operated from the hotel. In 1931 the Pre-Academic School of Hotel Management, established by the Naczelna Organizacja Polskiego Przemys≈Çu Hotelarskiego (the General Organization of Polish Hotel Industry) opened at the Polonia Palace. The hotel became a favorite spot for meetings and the accommodation of diplomats and aristocrats, who would celebrate winter and ‚Äògreen‚Äô carnivals there. The hotel was used by the German military during World War II, when it was renamed Hotel Der Reichshof and accommodated German officers.Torsten Sch√§fer, \\"Jedenfalls habe ich auch mitgeschossen.\\" Google Books, search: Hotel Reichshof. LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2007. It served as a hospital and supply base during the Warsaw Uprising and miraculously survived the almost complete destruction of the city of Warsaw. =Diplomatic Missions and Consulates (1945-1951)= The hotel re-opened on April 13, 1945. General Dwight David Eisenhower stayed at the hotel in 1945 for a victory banquet, greeted by huge crowds of cheering Varsovians. General Charles de Gaulle was also a guest that year. At that time, Polonia Palace was the best surviving hotel in Warsaw and many diplomatic representatives had their offices there. Memorial plaque =Post-war era= The hotel was renamed the Hotel Polonia during the Communist era. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai visited the hotel for a banquet in 1953. In 1955, during the Fifth International Chopin Piano Competition, the entire fourth floor was emptied and refurnished with over a dozen pianos for the competitors, including Adam Harasiewicz. The Hotel Metropol was built next to the Polonia in 1965, and the two hotels operated together. The Polonia was made a protected monument on July 1, 1965 and renovated in 1968-1973. Plans had originally called for the hotel's historic interiors to be gutted and completely modernized, but due to financial shortages, the work was not carried out and the original interiors survived. The hotel hosted congresses of technicians, steelworkers, and unions, and events like the a book fair. Its guests included representatives from the national football team like Zbigniew Boniek, Grzegorz Lato and Jan Tomaszewski and popular artists and bands like ‚ÄòSkaldowie‚Äô, ‚ÄòCzerwone Gitary‚Äô and Pozna≈Ñskie S≈Çowiki. In 1974, the state- owned Syrena Hotel Group was established, owning the Hotel Polonia and the adjoining Hotel Metropol. =Today= In 1997, Syrena was bought by an Austrian group for $24 million. They closed the Hotel Polonia in 2001 for a lengthy restoration, costing ‚Ç¨30 million. The hotel reopened as the Hotel Polonia Palace on March 31, 2005. It was again renovated in 2010., now the owner of Hotel Polonia Palace is a Chinese financial group Maria Jolanta Lubomirska Peter is not the family of the former owner. She is a cousin of the husband of Gabriella Przezdziecki. Konstantin Przezdziecki died with no material and financial resource April 21, 1966 in Stockholm, Sverige.

(2004) \\"Cell Biologist Multitasks for Women\\" The Scientist, March 15.  Early life and education  Osborn was born in Darlington, UK on December 16, 1940. Osborn completed high school education at Cheltenham Ladies' College and university education at Newnham College, Cambridge University where she was graduated in Mathematics and Physics in 1962. She received a masters in biophysics at Pennsylvania State University in 1963. Her PhD on mutagenesis in nonsense mutations in bacteria was awarded by Pennsylvania State University in 1972.  Research career  Mary Osborn carried out postdoctoral research from 1967-69 in the laboratory of James Watson at Harvard University. Then she conducted research at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK (1969‚Äì72) before moving to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1972-75.) Osborn had married her husband, Klaus Weber, on July 14, 1972. Weber and Osborn moved to the G√∂ttingen Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry where Weber was Director and Osborn received a staff appointment in 1975. in 1989, she was appointed an honorary professor at University of G√∂ttingen,. SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue Mary Osborn and Klaus Weber wrote a classic paper in biochemistry Nicole Kresge, Robert Simoni, and Robert Hill. (2006) \\"Classics.

They knew that in 1967 Shapiro, Vinuela, and Maisel had shown that electrophoresis of proteins along with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) in polyacrylamide gels (PAGE) could separate the tested polypeptide chains by molecular weight.AL Shapiro, E. Vinuela, and JV Maizel., Jr. (1967) \\"Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS- polyacrylamide gels.\\" Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 28: 815‚Äì820, To see if this method applied to proteins of various sizes and shapes, Osborn and Weber took 40 known proteins, including globular and filamentous proteins, analyzed them via SDS PAGE, and plotted the logarithms of their molecular weights against their electrophoretic mobilities. The results showed convincingly that ‚Äúthe good resolution and the fact that an estimate of the molecular weight can be obtained within a day, together with the small amount of protein needed, makes the method strongly competitive with others commonly employed.‚Äù This method has been used extensively by biochemists in all kinds of studies involving protein purification and identification as part of the process. Immunofluorescence of Hep2 Intermediate Filaments Later, Osborn and Weber pioneered fluorescent antibody staining of cellular substructures, a major technique called indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In developing the method, they tagged microtubules with specific antibodies, then used fluorescently-tagged secondary antibodies (antibodies to the first set of antibodies) to light up the locations of the microtubules in cells. When they began their work in Germany, the cytoskeleton was not heavily researched. Microtubules and microfilaments were known, and they established that microtubules always reacted with antibodies to tubulins while microfilaments always reacted with antibodies to actin. In the course of their studies, they also found intermediate filaments, slightly thicker than microfilaments, and unreactive to actin antibodies. They developed new antibodies against proteins of the microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments to use as reagents in examining many types of cells. Many of their antibodies have been licensed to companies for commercial development. Klaus and Osborn used their method to study elements of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells in two dimensions and three dimensions. Osborn has extensively studied microtubules, intermediate filaments, microfilaments, and nuclear proteins as well as other proteins that can associate with these structures. By 1981 Osborn and Klaus had shown conclusively intermediate filaments in different types of cells are different but related, and they can be distinguished using immunofluorescence. Soon thereafter, in 1982, the laboratory showed that many tumors differ from their matching normal tissue in the protein details of intermediate filaments as shown by immunofluorescence.M. Altmannsberger, M. Osborn, K. Weber, and A. Schauer. (1982) ‚ÄúExpression of intermediate filaments in different human epithelial and mesenchymal tumors.‚Äù Path. Res. Pract. 175, 227-237. They also found that intermediate filament composition was tumor-specific. Osborn and Weber have pioneered the diagnostic classification of tumor types using specific cytoskeletal elements determined via immunofluorescence microscopy. Their methods have been widely applied in numerous clinical studies of muscular dystrophy and cancer.  Support of women scientists  When Mary Osborn returned to Europe after years in the US, she was surprised to find that European science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields) had not opened doors to women as she had experienced in America. She was quoted in an article in Science in 1994 to the effect that women's role in Germany was still \\"kinder, kuche, kirch\\" (children, kitchen, church.) In 1992, she had written a protest letter in response to an editorial in Nature that had claimed child care issues were chiefly responsible for the leaky pipeline for women in science, not discrimination. As a woman without children who had experienced no gender discrimination early in her career but had seen differential treatment of men and women in science later, she did not find this argument convincing, and she was appalled to find out that Europe had collected little or no data on rates of success of women in science. Partly because Osborn objected to this situation, the European Commission (EC) appointed her co-chair of a working group to investigate the status of European women scientists and scientists in training and in employment and to prepare a report. The outcome was the European Technology Assessment Network (ETAN) Report on Women in Science, published in 2006, which identified a number of reasons why women dropped out of science and served as a blueprint for Europeans who wished to fix this problem. She noted in 2012 that there was still a leaky pipeline for women scientists in Germany. She has given a great deal of thought to how women are taught to act as they grow up and how that may impact their career decisions. In an interview in 2004, Osborn said, \\"In deciding whether to accept new challenges a remark by Diane Britten some years ago in The Times has proved very helpful: ‚ÄúWhen asked to do something women tend to say \`Why me?' Men say \`Why not me?' I have learned to say \`Why not me? Summing up her advice to those in charge of sciences in universities and industry, she said in 2012, \\"Above all one has to get the argument across that it is wasteful, expensive and unfair to educate and train large numbers of female scientists and then not use their talents in the job market or provide equal access to the top jobs.\\"  Awards and honors  *1979 Elected member, European Molecular Biology Organization *1987 Meyenburg Prize for Cancer Research *1995 Elected member, Academia Europaea *1997 Doctorate honoris causa, Pomeranian Medical Academy, Szczecin, Poland *1998 Carl Zeiss Prize, German Society of Cell Biology, (shared with Klaus Weber) *1998 Helena Rubenstein / UNESCO Prize for Women in Science (UK) * 2002 L'Or√©al / UNESCO Prize for Women in Science *2003-2006 President of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB) *2005 Outstanding Science Alumni Award, Pennsylvania State University, USA * 2014.

After moving to the greater Orlando, Florida area, Macnab joined the board of MyRegion, a seven-county visioning coalition in Central Florida and WMFE's Community Advisory Board, in addition to joining the League of Women Voters of Florida (LWVFL).  Political career  Macnab became president of the League of Women Voters of Florida (LWVFL) in 2009, where she spearheaded petitions for fair voting districts in Florida, tax reform and voter protection, and worked towards opening a dialogue with Cuba by organizing several delegations to the country. During her tenure as LWVFL president, two state constitutional amendments ending gerrymandering were finally accomplished, after 60 years of work by the Florida League. Under her presidency, the LWVFL announced a lawsuit in April 2014, protecting Florida voters from being purged from voter rolls within 90 days of a federal election, and she was asked to talk about it on The Daily Show. The state eventually decided not to purge the voter rolls. During her leadership, serious restrictions on voter registration drives were imposed and eventually removed because of the League's work. It eliminated roadblocks to voting by demanding the Florida Legislature re-institute early voting days, and the Sunday before election day, following long delays, including eight- hour lines in Miami, that voters faced during the 2012 Presidential election. The LWVFL also pushed for fairly-drawn congressional districts and saw fair districting upheld and implemented in 2014. Deirdre Macnab was nominated for the National Slate of the League of Women Voters of the United States in 2014, and was then nominated to be their National President in 2015. Her bid for the presidency was unsuccessful. She is generally credited with having transformed the Florida League of Women Voters as well as many state policies during her long tenure as president. Her latest initiatives include lobbying for the implementation of civil citations as a way to curb the school to prison pipeline and reduce youth arrests. She heads the campaign to take Florida to the number one position in rooftop solar andTampa Bay Times: Vote for Amendment 4 and Turn the Lights on for Solar http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/column-vote-for-amendment-4-and-turn- the-lights-on-for-solar-in-florida/2288373 harness the sunharness the sun to truly make Florida the \\"Sunshine State\\".

The Orlando Sentinel named her the Most Influential Central Floridian of the Year the same year. In 2013, she was recognized by La Prensa Florida as a Community Champion during their annual Mujeres Destacadas Awards. She was recognized for her leadership and placed in the Congressional Record in 2014. In 2015, Audubon Florida honored her with the Women in Conservation award.http://audubonoffloridanews.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/Audubon_AssemblyProgram_2015.pdf References Living people People from Florida American women's rights activists American political activists 1955 births ","title":"Deirdre Macnab"},{"id":"42560069","text":"Metacosmesis aelinopa is a moth in the family Carposinidae first described by Alexey Diakonoff in 1982.

LacUV5 is among the most commonly used promoters in molecular biology because it requires no additional activators and it drives high levels of gene expression. The lacUV5 promoter sequence conforms more closely to the consensus sequence recognized by bacterial sigma factors than the traditional lac promoter does. Due to this, lacUV5 recruits RNA Polymerase more effectively, thus leading to higher transcription of target genes. Additionally, unlike the lac promoter, lacUV5 works independently of activator proteins or other cis regulatory elements (apart from the -10 and -35 promoter regions). While no activators are required, lacUV5 promoter expression can be regulated by the LacI repressor and can be induced with IPTG, which is an effective inducer of protein expression when used in the concentration range of 100ŒºM to 1.5mM. Due to this control, the lacUV5 promoter is commonly found on expression plasmids and is used when controllable but high levels of a product are desired. The lacUV5 mutation was first identified in 1970 in a study of lac promoter mutants that produce higher yields. Some of them, including UV5, has lost catabolite repression at the CAP site. Development into cloning vectors is known since 1982, when a UV5-carrying phage known as \\"Œª h80 lacUV5 cI857\\" has its genome spliced with the HaeIII restriction enzyme to make plamids carrying the fragment with UV5.  Sequence  Modern lacUV5 is seen in the BL21(DE3) strain, which carries both a lac operon with the standard promoter and a lacUV5 operon split by the DE3 prophage (and as a result driving the T7 RNA polymerase instead).

It is the ninth game in the TOCA series. It aims to move the series back towards \\"more authentic racing games\\" following the release of Grid 2, which Codemasters felt was not as well-received by the company's core fanbase as it was hoped for. The developers consequently introduced major modifications to the handling model and built a lean, race-first oriented design for this title. Many critics who praised the game cited how Codemasters seemed to have \\"gone back to its roots\\", with aspects from its early games in the series. Feral Interactive, who brought the game to macOS and Linux, also brought the game to iOS on 27 November 2017. The Nintendo Switch version, also from Feral Interactive, was released on 19 September 2019, and their Android version of the game was released on 26 November 2019. A sequel, Grid, was announced and released on 11 October 2019 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. Gameplay In Grid Autosport, the player acts as a racing driver with opportunities to start and build their own racing career via the single-player Career mode, enter competitions with fellow players on the web via the multiplayer Online mode, customise their racing experience (vehicle, circuit, race type, difficulty, etc.) to their own tastes via the single- player Custom Cup mode, and play against each other via the multiplayer Splitscreen mode. It is the first video game in GRID series not to feature Vehicle Customization this time in single player career as only featured in online mode. The Career mode is divided into seasons before which the player each time has to choose between offers from the game's racing teams. The teams ‚Äì including the best-in-the-business Ravenwest, making a return from Race Driver: Grid ‚Äì each have different season objectives and sponsor objectives, the achievement of which earns extra experience points (XP) for the players besides those received for their results. Online racing is conducted via RaceNet, Codemasters' community hub on which players can form racing clubs, earn XP and cash as they race and fulfill sponsor objectives, then use their earnings to purchase and upgrade vehicles. Soon after the game's release, they were also presented with sets of specific challenges, called RaceNet Challenges, announced by Codemasters. Grid Autosport emphasises the concept of racing disciplines, making them into the new event categories. There are five main categories: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. During Career mode, the player picks a particular event in one of these categories, with each event (a string of races) making up a season. Each discipline features markedly different cars and race types. The latter include standard Races, Endurance races with tire wear enabled, Time Attack events, Drift events, and - as downloadable content (DLC) - Time Trials, Drag and point-to- point Sprint races. These are all accessible in Custom Cup mode as well, in which the player can also choose to participate in certain special event types, such as Checkpoint, Eliminator and Demolition Derby. Focusing on providing a more realistic driving experience, the studio revamped its damage model, adding new elements, such as a wear and tear system, which means car parts lose performance through general use, and a suspension damage system. It also introduced a new team radio philosophy in which the player itself can request information on car damage, gaps, rival position and teammate position. The player can also ask its engineer to instruct their teammates to attack, defend or hold their position. By popular demand, Codemasters retained its unique Flashback feature from previous Grid installments with which the players can rewind their races a few seconds and resume it earlier, if needed. Cockpit view also made a return, after being absent, very much to the dismay of the core fanbase, in Grid 2. Aside from such elements, the developers generally decided to strip the game down and do away with everything that stood in the way of raw racing. These features included the Grid 2 narrator- driven career mode and superfluous menus. =Cars= The cars in the disciplines of Grid Autosport are further divided into tiers and classes of various strength. Some of the highlights of the vehicles on offer are the contemporary BTCC (Class C), Stock Car Brasil (Class A) and V8 Supercars (Super Tourers) of the Touring discipline (e. g. Chevrolet Cruze and Holden Commodore (VF, as well as the present-day and classic GT cars of the Endurance discipline (like the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 (Category B) and the Ford GT40 Mk I), the Dallara DW12 chassis of the IndyCar Series (Formula A) from the Open Wheel discipline, American muscle cars (e. g. the Ford Mustang Boss 302), among others, representing the Tuner discipline and the likes of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport and the Koenigsegg Agera R (Hypercars) representing the Street discipline. In total, including DLCs, the game features 103 cars. This is the second video game under Grid series not to feature Toyota cars and First in series to not to feature Chevrolet Corvette. =Tracks= In the case of the tracks, the main emphasis is on real-world permanent circuits which make up the majority of the courses in the game. These range from classics, such as Spa-Francorchamps, Brands Hatch, Mount Panorama and Indianapolis, to more modern facilities, like the Circuit of the Americas, Sepang, the Red Bull Ring and the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. City locations with fictionally lined, but mostly real-world streets of San Francisco, Paris, Dubai etc., and - as DLCs - fictional point-to-point tracks in authentic settings complete the picture. In all, players are able to race on 15 real-world permanent circuits, 2 fictional permanent circuits, 7 street circuits, and 4 point-to-point tracks, including additional content, for a total of 28 locations with over 130 configurations. Development Ford GT40 Mk I. Grid Autosport was announced on 22 April 2014 via the official Codemasters Blog, less than a year after the release of its predecessor, Grid 2. Producer Toby Evan-Jones revealed in an interview that the development of the new title began as soon as the development of Grid 2 came close to a finish. This occurred in the spring of 2013. Evan-Jones had this to say on the short development cycle between the two games and the general intentions with Grid Autosport: The game eliminated the so-called TrueFeel handling of Grid 2, but it did not simply return to the handling of Race Driver: Grid. Codemasters used a new, improved version of its previous model, better simulating how grip falls away, when the player approaches the slip angle of the tyres. Decision to use the new model, which was tested by Autosport magazine experts and racing drivers, was made on 23 January 2014, which was followed by applying it to each car's grip falloff graph and re-tuning the vehicles' individual handling characteristics. According to the company, the shift caused the most difficulties in modeling the behaviour of open wheelers and American muscle cars. It also necessitated re-doing the AI benchmarking work, which was well-underway by then using the old model. The game was built using Codemasters' in-house EGO 3.0 engine. Graphically, Grid Autosport benefitted heavily from optimisation and fine- tuning of said long-standing engine to achieve better performance on low-end machines, while on the other end, support for DirectX 11 features enabled the programmers to improve renderings, especially grass and light, from Grid 2. On 4 March 2015, Feral Interactive announced that it would port the game to OS X and Linux. The online multiplayer system was also among the areas that Codemasters decided to overhaul compared to Grid 2, based on fan feedback. The framework of earning XP and cash to purchase own vehicles and garage slots was a result of community criticism towards the previous framework in which the player had a ladder, laid out in advance by the game, to unlock cars. Feedback deemed the old approach too easy to complete. As for the extremely tight development schedule, involving less than twelve months, lead designer James Nicholls said: Release Grid Autosport comes in two versions ‚Äì a standard edition and a special edition, the latter of which is called the Black Edition. It was announced on 8 May 2014 and it includes an extra vehicle (a Mercedes Benz SLS AMG Coup√© Black Series), extra sponsors and extra liveries for both offline and online modes. Pre-orders for Grid Autosport by retailers began as soon as the initial game announcement was made. Steam pre-orders went online a week later than planned, on 30 May 2014, however, all of those who pre-ordered the title via Steam received the Black Edition at no extra cost compared to the standard edition. Those who owned Grid 2 received a 10% discount and a free copy of Dirt Showdown as well. Grid Autosport was officially released on 24 June 2014 in North America and 27 June 2014 in Europe across all three current-gen platforms, PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The OS X and Linux port was released on 10 December 2015 by Feral Interactive. Lead designer James Nicholls confirmed as early as the initial game announcement that the game would not make it onto next-gen platforms given the tight timeframes the team worked with during the development process. However, The Xbox 360 version became backwards compatible with the Xbox One in June 2018, four years after their game's release.https://www.trueachievements.com/n33358/fable-heroes-grid-autosport- and-more-now-backwards-compatible =Updates & downloadable content= The game received downloadable content packs until November 2014, usually once in every two weeks. The majority of these can be broken down into two main categories: mini expansions and car packs. Codemasters put out three mini expansions for this Grid title. Perhaps the most eagerly anticipated one of these was the Touring Legends Pack as it featured two new real-world circuits ‚Äì Donington Park and Silverstone ‚Äì, five classic BTCC touring cars from the mid-1990s and new single player championships (outside Career mode). Another mini expansion, called Sprint Pack, introduced the Sprint race type to the game, besides featuring four fictional point-to-point tracks and more extra championships. The third one, the Drag Pack, introduced the Drag race type, three drag cars and nine single player championships. Car packs, of which there were three as well, included the Best of British Pack, which contained three British-originated vehicles, e. g. the McLaren F1 GTR, the Coup√© Style Pack, that offered four new coup√©s, such as the Hyundai Genesis Coup√©, and a Road & Track Pack, which added two road-going cars and two racing cars to the game. There has been a number of additional DLC available to the game. For example, a Season Pass was created with which the player practically subscribed to the above six packs at a discount rate. A High Res Texture Pack boosted game textures up to 4K resolution and was made available to download with the base game at the launch for free. A Premium Garage Pack was also released, adding five additional garage spots for online play, and the Black Edition content was later sold as a standalone DLC pack as well. Additionally, a free Demoman Derby DLC was released on 7 November 2014, exclusively on PC, which includes two skins from Team Fortress 2, and consisting a different environment and billboards which are also based on Team Fortress 2. On 15 July 2014, the studio released Boost Pack, a small piece of code to boost career and online XP progression, for the same price as the car packs. Controversy followed as Codemasters Community Manager Ben Walke commented the reason behind the already criticised move was simply that \\"it sells.\\" Continued patch support of the game saw the developer team repeatedly addressing various emerging save game corruption issues, online playlist issues, etc. They enabled the Time Trial race type (which was missing from the base game due to prolonged technical difficulties), added Oculus Rift support and a virtual rear-view mirror (although, in the case of the latter, only for PC). Reception The game received generally positive reviews. Metacritic gave it an aggregate score of 78/100 for PC and 75/100 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Critics especially praised its more authentic handling model as well as its stripped-down approach to racing and excellent damage system. The Career mode gained widespread approval for being \\"simply about winning races and mastering various driving styles\\" with the ability to switch between disciplines letting the player \\"go as focused or as broad as [he or she] likes.\\" GamesRadar+ felt that having a nominated opponent provided \\"a decent sense of rivalry (‚Ä¶) which gives races more meaning (‚Ä¶) and the experience is richer for having clear rivals to beat.\\" Eurogamer called Online mode \\"a comprehensive suite\\", one which \\"a series of [car] mods and upgrades lends persistence\\" to. Game Informer said that it \\"offers slightly more freedom [than the Career mode]\\" and its feature set is \\"varied.\\" The online playing experience was considered \\"smooth, with no drop outs or lag experienced.\\" In terms of handling, the reviewers emphasised that the game \\"still straddles the line between simulation and arcade,\\" but it \\"definitely leans a little further on the side of realism [than most Codemasters games]\\" and \\"it's a significant improvement on Grid 2's awkward dynamics.\\" Edge noted that it \\"offers considerable depth\\" and its \\"lively feedback makes for an intense, and satisfying, drive.\\" Despite that, it is \\"still approachable\\" and Luke Reilly from IGN found the model to be \\"fairly forgiving.\\" The game's artificial intelligence (AI) behaviour was said to be a success, at least in part. The computer-controlled opponents' \\"defensive driving lines, late-braking overshoots into hairpins, and fiendishly clever cut-backs\\" can make \\"a normally disappointing 8th place finish (‚Ä¶) just as rewarding as a win.\\" As for their speed, it is heavily dependent on difficulty levels, of which the lowest allows the player to \\"thread through 16 positions over the course of three laps with little resistance\\", while on the hardest \\"you can spend a whole race exchanging 13th and 14th positions with another car.\\" PC Advisor praised the \\"immense\\" variety of cars present in the game as well as the inclusion of \\"plenty of classics\\". Kotaku added that the \\"more experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between their fleet.\\" The title's damage model was critically acclaimed as the above review highlighted that \\"each car [is] responding accurately to collisions\\" with the crashes having \\"a massive effect on performance.\\" Edge deemed the system a \\"triumph.\\" The introduction of tyre wear (in Endurance events) was also welcomed ‚Äì GamesRadar+ wrote that \\"it becomes so integral to the driving process, you'll find yourself looking for the [tyre life] percentage indicators in other modes every time you hear the wheels slip.\\" Grid Autosport has a \\"generous selection of tracks\\", in which \\"real-world circuits are the focus\\" at the expense of \\"unforgiving (‚Ä¶) and tight\\" street circuits. The general graphical qualities of the game were lauded as \\"magnificent\\" and \\"lovely\\" with \\"incidental details [on the race track that] make for an engaging race-day atmosphere\\" being particularly impressing. As for the game interface, Edge hailed its \\"pared-down design (‚Ä¶) with simple, clean (and fast loading) menus.\\" Similarly to graphics, the most positive aspects of sounds were the details; the \\"nice ambient effects\\" and the \\"small touches such as being able to hear the commentators over the track\\" that make the experience \\"more immersive.\\" GamesRadar+ found the new system of being able to request information on the pit channel useful, claiming \\"you can rely on aural feedback (‚Ä¶) for maximum authenticity.\\" By far the most heavily criticised feature of the game was, ironically, the returning cockpit view. It is, while \\"incredibly welcome from a gameplay standpoint, (‚Ä¶) visually they're a slapped-on eyesore, blurred-out in an attempt to hide the lack of detail.\\" IGN remarked that they \\"lack any working dials or mirrors.\\" Several reviews mention that they found the AI to be, depending on discipline, too aggressive, so much so that \\"having an AI take you out at least once a race is (‚Ä¶) to be expected.\\" Edge elaborated that \\"they don't always concede in the same way a human driver might, sticking to their chosen route even though you legitimately out-braked them into a corner.\\" Leaving out pit stops also left some of the critics puzzled. IGN said \\"it's a bizarre omission (‚Ä¶) that quietly undermines a lot of what Autosport does right\\", pointing out that suffering a puncture leaves the player with no option to repair the damage. Eurogamer warned that the content-wise excellent Career mode can feel \\"long and drawn-out\\" and that \\"progress in GRID Autosport is slow.\\" GameTrailers added that \\"the whole experience feels rather clinical.\\" The reception of the request-based team radio was also mixed with GamesRadar+ arguing that \\"the pit audio repeats itself far too quickly and doesn't always make perfect sense.\\" Finally, a number of reviewers noted that a lot of cars and tracks are re-used material from earlier Codemasters titles, which feels \\"stale\\".

It is now owned by the Taylor Group of Newspapers. History The forerunner of the newspaper was the Renmark Pioneer (9 April 1892 - 4 July 1913?), which was a weekly newspaper published in Renmark, South Australia. Originally published on a Saturday, it later appeared on Fridays. Its first issue was produced by the \\"chromograph\\" method (a gelatin pad transfer system); its second by a form of mimeograph, with advertisements printed using a Cyclostyle machine by its first editor, A. P. Corrie. An Albion press was later procured. The last issue which has been digitised by the National Library of Australia for its \\"Trove\\" service is dated 4 July 1913. In 1913 it was renamed to the Murray Pioneer and Australian River Record subtitled \\"With which is incorporated The Renmark Pioneer\\" (which first appears in digitised form as the issue dated 2 January 1914; listed as Volume 19 No. 1 and Volume 1 No. 76 New series). In 1928, it absorbed rival publication The Loxton Clarion and Murray Lands Guardian from Jack Irving. In 1942, the name was simplified to the current title. In 1964, the newspaper bought out The Loxton News (28 April 1960-present), also founded by Irving. Along with The Bunyip, The River News, and The Loxton News, The Murray Pioneer is now owned by the Taylor Group of Newspapers. After many years of publishing two editions (Tuesdays and Fridays) per week, in July 2019 the Murray Pioneer switched to a single Wednesday edition per week. Editors Arthur Pitman Corrie (ca.April 1871 - 9 September 1932) served an apprenticeship as a mechanic before producing the first Renmark Pioneer in 1892. He guided its progress from chromograph through cyclostyle to a small printing press, though he never mastered the art of letterpress. He moved to Queensland, where he joined the Brisbane Daily Mail then in October 1914 enlisted with the AIF, and with the 1st Light Horse Field Ambulance saw action in the Middle East. He later became a Methodist minister, and aside from his pastoral duties he was Maryborough correspondent for the Brisbane Courier. He married Flora Mary; they had one son, Leslie Robertson Corrie. Chris(topher) J(ames) Ashwell (ca.1850 - 27 June 1905) was on the staff of the Mildura Cultivator before becoming in 1896 the proprietor and editor of the Renmark Pioneer. He was particularly known in those towns as a chess enthusiast. He was largely responsible for founding the (community licensed) Renmark Hotel. Harry S(amuel) Taylor (13 January 1873 - 13 February 1932) was a grandson of Samuel Smith, founder of Yalumba winery. He was educated at Prince Alfred College and began his working life as a teacher before becoming interested in horticulture. He married S. Helen Smith in 1897, took up an orchard on the River Murray. He progressed to journalism with the Mildura Cultivator (later named the Sunraysia Daily), writing as \\"H.S.T.\\" and \\"The Rambler\\", before taking over the Pioneer in 1905. He was lauded by an editor of The Bunyip, another South Australian regional newspaper, as being well informed on foreign affairs, and uniquely cool headed during the Great War. He was an idealist who did not see his newspaper as a \\"money-making megaphone\\".  Distribution  Like other Taylor Group publications, the newspaper is also available online.

The film is the first porn parody produced by British studio Harmony Films and directed by Gazzman. The film includes an all-British cast, including Ben Dover and Lexi Lowe as the title character \\"Abby\\", and was filmed in a castle near Birmingham. Gazzman states that the local town council tried to get the shoot closed down when villagers realized what was going on at their castle, but the production wrapped successfully. Plot Down on Abby is set at the beautiful Bottomley Manor, home to the eccentric and debauched Lord and Lady Grabhem and their stepdaughters Abby and Fanny. The film follows the upper-class family upstairs and members of the working-class staff downstairs, including characters with names such as Master Bates, as they prepare for a dinner party quite unlike any other.

A softcore version is also available to buy from Amazon.com Television X announced that they had acquired the film's exclusive television rights and would be airing one episode a week from 5 April 2014. Press Down on Abby garnered attention from international mainstream press as well as adult industry-related media since the announcement of its production with mentions from Jimmy Fallon on the Jimmy Fallon Show, Cosmopolitan, Time, The Sun-Herald and the London Metro among others. Stars of the main Downton Abbey show have also expressed dismissive opinions on the porn parody. Michelle Dockery spoke of her \\"porn doppleganger\\" Lexi Lowe, pointing to Lowe on the cover and saying \\"That's me, is it? The one with the extremely large breasts?\\" during an interview with Conan O'Brien on Conan. Hugh Bonneville was also asked about his opinion of Down on Abby by Brad Blanks on the red carpet of The Monuments Men premi√®re in New York City. When told the title, Bonnevile stated \\"that's hilarious\\" before jokingly asking Bob Balaban if he had directed it. Balaban replied that he had been the assistant director. Bonnevile stated that he \\"can't wait to watch it\\" and that he would get the Downton Abbey crew around to watch it for a Saturday night event. Reception The parody has had a mixed reception. Mainstream press appear to give generally negative reviews of the parody. A New York magazine writer commented that although the parody of the Downton Abbey was humorous, it was \\"rife with historical inaccuracies\\" and \\"not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off French tips and thongs.\\". A writer for Cosmopolitan magazine wrote: \\"What I witnessed were things that were both horrifying and factually incorrect: This nonsense would never have happened at Downton Abbey or any respectable 1920's British country estate\\" In contrast, adult industry reviewers give a generally more positive review. A reviewer for the porn review website Die Screaming wrote: \\"After watching Down on Abby, I can say with absolute certainty that the movie more than lived up to all the hype surrounding it.\\" and \\"Down on Abby delivers a solid hardcore porn film wrapped in the luxurious look and feel of British aristocratic wealth, which is exactly what you‚Äôd want from a Downton Abbey porn parody.\\" He added \\"I also need to take a moment to stand up and applaud Lexi Lowe. Her scene with Tony DeSergio and Clarke Kent was arguably the highlight of the movie, with Ms. Lowe delivering a performance that will make your jaw drop.\\" and ended the review with 5/5 stars. Another review from adult DVD review site XCritic noted: \\"I was surprised at how good I thought the movie was. A porn parody of Downton Abby was inevitable, but it found a way to get beautiful and sexy stars to parody the costume drama and mix in hot, depraved sex. I loved the puns with the names (Smallcock, Lord Stiffie, Lady Stiffie, etc.) and thought it was very funny overall.

The organization is nonpartisan; the League's Bylaws mandate that the organization will not support any political candidate or party. League promotes political responsibility through informed and active participation of citizens in government, acts on selected governmental issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy. League's members do advocate on policy issues. History The Florida State League of Women Voters was founded on March 31, 1921 by May Mann Jennings, at a meeting in Jacksonville. It immediately voted to affiliate with the national League of Women Voters, although unlike the national organization and the Leagues in other states, the FSLWV was not the successor of a suffrage organization.Carver, Joan S. \\"First League of Women Voters in Florida: Its Troubled History.\\" The Florida Historical Quarterly 63, no. 4 (1985): 383-405. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30152979 In the 1920s the FSLWV included many of the most prominent women in the state and was a strongly feminist movement, with women's issues at the top of its priorities. Following a decline in the 1930s, the organization was reorganized in 1939 first as the Florida Non- Partisan League of Women Voters, subsequently renamed the League of Women Voters of Florida. Its first project was a study of state government with a particular focus on the state's Constitution. In 1949, the League worked to pass the 1949 permissive jury service statute. Prior to 1949 and the work done by the LWVFL, women in Florida could not serve on juries. Early advocacy efforts encouraged the Florida Legislature to end the process of gerrymandering. In 2011, Florida voters approved two gerrymandering-related redistricting amendments which were placed in the State Constitution. The LWVFL and other groups sued over the redistricting. In addition, the LWVFL suspended operation for a year during that time, and when the gerrymandering aspects of the provision were blocked by a federal judge. The gerrymandering was ruled unconstitutional in Florida since it strongly favored one party over another. In 2012, the group worked again to register voters, this time with a five-week deadline. The LWVFL continued to monitor district maps and redistricting. The LWVFL also fought against a 2012 proposal to purge voting rolls which then President Deirdre Macnab called an effort to \\"disproportionately impact minority voters and erroneously disenfranchise those that are eligible.\\" Modern League More than thirty local Leagues statewide hold candidate forums, issue election year Voters Guides, and sponsor public seminars. Patricia Brigham is the current President of the League of Women Voters of Florida. The Board of Directors for the Florida League includes Cecile M. Scoon, Esq., First Vice President; Shawn Bartelt, Second Vice President; Mark Songer, Treasurer; Lisa Hall, Secretary; and seven additional directors. LWVFL encourages civic engagement and is strictly nonpartisan, though it has been accused of partisanship. LWVFL works tirelessly \\"to educate, mobilize, and register voters...\\" stated Attorney General Eric Holder. LWVFL has engaged in a number of statewide and local projects, including recommending the initiation of a recycling program in St. Petersburg; supporting the Central Florida commuter rail network SunRail; endorsing a court case which ended voter purges held 90 days before a federal election; striking down of restrictions on volunteer voter registration efforts;Declaration of Deirdre Macnab Submitted in Further Support of Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida. the re-institution of early voting days and early voting on the Sunday before election day; and the redrawing of both congressional and state legislative district lines after extensive litigation.

During election year cycles, LWVFL maintains two comprehensive, fact-based, nonpartisan Florida voter websites, Be Ready To Vote and Vamos A Votar, the Spanish language version. It has lobbied for gun safety for years, but after the 2016 shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the group became a driving force in a statewide initiative to establish stricter gun safety guidelines through the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence.

History From ancient times, people have worshiped Lord Mahadeva. The arrival of a Brahmin Scholar known as Thampuran from the Pazhore Padippura became responsible for the incarnation of Devi in this area. Thampuran, who had come from the north, took up his residence at Nedunagappally, Ramapuram in the south of this region. Later, on his return to his native place, Thampuran took along with him the idol of Devi, his deity of worship. During his journey, because of the omnipotence of Mahadeva, the idol happened to fall into the pond in the Kannirasi. Despite laborious efforts, Thampuran could not regain the idol. With a heavy heart, Thampuran returned to his native place. After several years while members of the Naluveettil family were digging the pond, they found the idol of Devi in the pond. Kalathattu and Anakottil Having been hit by their digging implements, blood began to ooze from the idol. Realizing the vitality of Devi, people took possession of the idol with devotion and began to worship. As the idol was obtained during the process of digging the pond, the name \\"Vettikulangara came into vogue. By preserving the purity and antiquity, the pond is being protected even today. As Adi Parashakti, the mother of mercy and the giver of vitality, Sri Karthyayani Devi resides here.

He arrived in the Valley of Virginia in the years before the establishment of Augusta County, Virginia in 1738.Waddell, p. 309 Many sources identify him as a Scotch-Irish immigrant or of Irish ancestry,* Morton, p. 40 with others specifying that he or his descendants were of Welsh ancestry.Atkinson, p.229 The Scotch-Irish immigration to America began in 1718, with an influx of immigrants settling in Chester, Pennsylvania from 1719 to 1722,Bolton, p. 271 which at that time encompassed the banks of the Susquehanna River to the north and south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Bolton, p. 276 The majority of these early Scotch-Irish settlers of Chester County, Pennsylvania are thought to have come from the northwest of Ireland due to their naming conventions of Pennsylvania towns (such as Derry, Donegal, and Toboyne, all named for their respective towns in northern Ireland to the west of the River Foyle),Bolton, p. 272 and it is believed that all of the early settlers of Augusta County, Virginia came from these settlement in Pennsylvania.Waddell, p. 26 An 1869 London publication states that a branch of a prominent Welsh Mathew family settled \\"in the north-west of Ireland,\\"Notes, p. 298 leading some to suggest that John Mathews of Augusta County, Virginia was a descendant of this family through a Theobald Mathew (d. 1699), whose father George Mathew moved from Radyr, Wales to Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland in 1625.Boots, p. 68 Others have claimed that John Mathews descended from the same Welsh Mathew family, but through different branches. A great- grandson of John Mathews, James Hervey Otey, claims that Mathews descended from Samuel Mathews (1630‚Äì1660), a colonial governor of Virginia,Otey, p 161, p. 117 and another sources indicates that John Mathews was the son of British admiral Thomas Mathews.Callahan, p. 8 None of these connections have been noted by professional scholars.Dorman, p. 636-648Stephen, p. 46 Historians Joseph Waddell and Lymon Chalkley, whose secondary source works compile most of the known facts of Mathews' life, do not speculate on Mathews' ancestry, and state that the time and place in which Mathews settled (present-day Rockbridge County, Virginia) was predominately settled by Scotch-Irish immigrants, with Waddell stating that \\"up to the time of the Revolutionary War, very few persons of any other race [besides Scotch-Irish] came to live in the county.\\"Waddell, p. 1 Life Map of Borden's Tract, Augusta County, Virginia, circa 1757 John Mathews settled in Augusta County, Virginia, in what is present-day Rockbridge County, around 1737. At this time, Augusta County was a sparsely populated frontier county with an indefinite western boundary. The Colonial Virginia government sought to develop \\"buffer settlements of European Protestants\\" to protect the interior of the colony from Indian conflict and prevent French expansion eastward, among other reasons. In pursuit of this aim, the Virginia Governor's council granted land speculator Benjamin Borden a 100,000 tract of land in then-Augusta County, and Borden recruited, almost exclusively, immigrants from the Scotch-Irish immigration of 1717‚Äì1775 to this tract. Being one of the earliest arrivals in the area, Mathews made a rush for lands outside of Borden's Tract, and in 1739 received a grant for 1,600 acres in the valley of Mill's Creek, a tributary of Buffalo Creek in an area called Poage's Run.Kegley, p. 60, 63 This tract, of an oblong diamond shape three miles long and a half mile wide in the middle, extended near present-day Buffalo Forge to the north and Hickory Hill to the south. The Falling Springs Presbyterian Church is located on this site.Feamster Mathews settled on this tract, building a log \\"Manor House\\" in the southwest corner. At this time, Mathews was a yeoman farmer.Chalkley3, p. 268 Over the ensuing decade, he bought and sold numerous landholdings and made improvements to his properties;Chalkley3, p. 268, 315, 341,Chalkley3, p. 33 by 1750, he was recognized in official records as a gentleman, or a member of the landed gentry of colonial Virginia.Chalkley3, p. 341CWF Mathews, like all able-bodied men of Augusta County, served as a member of the county militia.Waddell, p. 45 In 1742, he was listed as a private in Augusta County's 2nd company, commanded by Captain John Buchanan,Waddell, p. 46 though other sources indicate he was appointed captain in this year.Morton, p. 54 At this time, the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy were launching offensives against the white settlers of western Pennsylvania and Virginia, who they found to be in violation of the 1722 Treaty of Albany.Walton, Joseph S. (1900). Conrad Weiser and the Indian Policy of Colonial Pennsylvania, pp. 114. Retrieved 12/18/18 from https://archive.org/details/cu31924087975466/page/n135 In December 1742, the Iroquois descended on Augusta County, resulting in significant losses to life and goods of the settlers. Such activity would continue over the years, often during winter, when food and supplies were relatively scarce. Mathews cited \\"losses by Indians\\" in the winter of 1745.Chalkley, p.15 In the spring of 1746, Mathews was confirmed a justice of the peace of the Magistrate's Court for Augusta County.Chalkley, p.17 As such, he issued warrants and reviewed arrests.Chalkley, p.434 In the same year, in what was the first election held in the county, Mathews was elected to the vestry of the Anglican Church for the Augusta Parish, along with eleven other men.Waddell, p. 58 At this time in Virginia, vestrymen, though ecclesiastic officials, were de facto public officers who represented the entirety of the local government.Peyton, p. 97 As such, vestrymen were required to take all relevant oaths of allegiance for public office. This presented a conflict for the Presbyterian Scotch-Irish, dissenters of the established Church of England in the Virginia Colony. Waddell explains that they \\"probably pleaded the necessity\\" of taking the oath despite their dissent.Waddell, p. 59 Mathews' duties as a vestryman included processioning lands, issuing levies, providing for parish expenses, tending to the poor, and other local administrative needs.Waddell, p. 59 On at least one occasion, his house served as an informal church before Augusta Parish had an official building for the purpose.Waddell, p. 118 Mathews additionally acted as an overseer of construction efforts in the county, including, in 1753, a road from the North Forks of the James River to Renix Road, for which forty- five workers were employed,Chalkley, p.61 and another, presumably smaller road, begun in 1754, from North River to Campbell's School House, for which three men were employed.Chalkley, p.62 When the French and Indian War broke out in 1755, Mathews served as an ensign in an offensive against the French and their Indian allies in what would come to be known as Braddock's Expedition.Henning, p. 194-195 Up to five of Mathews' sons served alongside him in the infantry.Henning, p. 195 The result was a decisive defeat for the British. Of the approximately 1,300 men Braddock led into battle, 456 were killed and 422 wounded, with Braddock among the dead. Governor of Virginia Robert Dinwiddie had set aside lands to be granted for service in the war, with 400 acres for privates and increasing amounts, based on rank, for officers. Mathews, in 1755, received a 1,600 acre grant from Dinwiddie \\"on Mill Creek in the Forks of the James.\\" In the following year, 1756, Mathews retained his commission of captain of infantry for the Augusta County militia.Waddell, p. 137 It wouldn't be until the years 1758‚Äì1761, after Mathews' death, that Augusta County would see a brief reprieve from Indian warfare.Waddell, p. 162 In the year of his death, 1757, Mathews was serving as one of two wardens for the county.Chalkley, p.494Waddell, p.58 In his will he bequethed his lands and property to his wife and children, and left ten dollars to the poor of the Augusta parish.Morton1920, p. 58, 176 Family John Mathews married Ann Archer, daughter of Sampson Archer, a Scotch-Irish immigrant.Waddell, p.309 They had eleven children: John Jr., Joshua, Richard, Sampson, George, William, Archer, Jane, Anna, Rachel, and Elizabeth.Waddell, p.309 Mathews' eldest son, John Jr., was murdered along with his family in their home in 1763,Morton1920, p. 68 the site of one of the earliest church gatherings in Augusta County.Waddell, p. 118 A relative later deeded this land to the trustees of the Falling Springs Presbyterian Church, which now stands on the site of the old Mathews house.Waddell, p.309 Four of Mathews' sons served in public office in the State of Virginia: Sampson, George, and Archer Mathews were elected to the Virginia General Assembly,Kromkowski, http://vavh.electionstats.com/php/bio.php?pid=4813Kromkowski, http://vavh.electionstats.com/php/bio.php?pid=4805Kromkowski, http://vavh.electionstats.com/php/bio.php?pid=4797, and William Mathews served as a justice of the peace in Botetourt County, Virginia.McIlwaine, pgs. 99, 112Waddell, p.278Cole, p. 69-70 George Mathews additionally served as a governor of Georgia and a US Representative to the First Congress. =Other notable descendants= Numerous descendants of John Mathews have had notable roles in public affairs.

The mosque was built in the year 1906 and completed in 1909. In beginning of its establishment, the mosque was a part of the Maimun palace complex. Its architectural style combines Middle Eastern, Indian and Spanish elements. The mosque has an octagonal shape and has wings to the south, east, north and west. History Sultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alam as a leader of Sultanate of Deli started the development of Masjid Al Mashun on 21 August 1906 (1 Rajab 1324 AH). The entire development was completed on 10 September 1909 (25 Sha'ban 1329 AH) and marked by the implementation of the first Friday prayers at the mosque. The overall development budget was one million guilders. The Sultan developed the Mosque according to his principle that it should be more important than his own grand palace, the Maimoon Palace. Construction of the mosque was financed by the Sultanate of Deli, the Deli Maatschappij, and Tjong A Fie, the wealthiest businessman in Medan at that time. Governor-General Dirk Fock visiting the Great Mosque, 1925 Architecture At first, the Mosque was designed by the Dutch architect Theodoor van Erp who also designed The Maimoon Palace, but was then handed over to JA Tingdeman. Van Erp at that time was called to Java by the Dutch government to join in the process of restoring the Borobudur temple in Central Java. The construction required the import of different building materials such as: marble from Italy, Germany and China and the stained glass from the chandelier imported from France. JA Tingdeman designed the mosque with an octagonal symmetrical layout style, combining elements from Morocco, Europe and the Middle East. The eight square floor plan produced a unique inner chamber, unlike most conventional mosques. A black, high vaulted roof porch is constructed in each of the four corners of the mosque, and complements the main dome on the roof of the main building of the mosque. Each is equipped with a main door and stairs between the courts of the main floor of the mosque is elevated, except building the porch on the side of the mihrab. The mosque is divided into the main room, ablution, entry gates and towers. The main room, a place of prayer, does not share the same octagonal theme.

It is a combination of piperaquine and dihydroartemisinin. Specifically it is used for malaria of the P. falciparum and P. vivax types. It is taken by mouth. Side effects are uncommon. Concerns include the possibility of QT prolongation. Versions are available for use in children. Use in early pregnancy is not recommended. The two medications work by different mechanisms. Piperaquine/dihydroartemisinin was approved for medical use in Europe in 2011. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. While it was available for about US$6 per treatment course, efforts are underway as of 2010 to bring the price down one dollar per course. It is commercially available in Africa and Asia. It has been used to treat more than 4.5 million people as of 2017. Pharmacology Dihydroartemisinin (also known as dihydroqinghaosu, artenimol or DHA) is a drug used to treat malaria. Dihydroartemisinin is the active metabolite of all artemisinin compounds (artemisinin, artesunate, artemether, etc.) and is also available as a drug in itself. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin and is widely used as an intermediate in the preparation of other artemisinin-derived antimalarial drugs. Piperaquine is an antimalarial drug, a bisquinoline first made in the 1960s, and used extensively in China and Indochina as prophylaxis and treatment during the next 20 years. Usage declined in the 1980s as piperaquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum arose and artemisinin-based antimalarials became available. The combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is an effective antimalarial that is used widely around the world. In South- East Asia, where resistance has emerged towards both artemisinin and piperaquine, the combination is being trialed with a third drug, namely mefloquine. Piperaquine is characterized by slow absorption and a long biological half-life, making it a good partner drug with artemisinin derivatives which are fast acting but have a short biological half-life.

Ferguson was the son of John Ferguson and Catherine Matilda Pomeroy (Ferguson). His father was a Methodist minister and his mother a schoolteacher. Ferguson attended Albert College in Ontario, Canada and then Boston University, where he graduated in 1886. He was ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church and, in 1887, married Mary Elizabeth Wilson.Lawton, Thomas. \\"John C. Ferguson: A Fellow Feeling of Fallibility,\\" Orientations 27 (1996): 65-76 Their son Douglas Ferguson was a sculptor and political activist. A daughter, Mary, served in the administration of the Peking Union Medical College in the 1930s. Career in China Cai Naihuang and John Calvin Ferguson Ferguson and his new wife were posted to a Methodist mission in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, where he took up the serious study of the Chinese language, starting with classical texts, which he then translated into colloquial language to improve his speaking ability. A series of riots in 1891, the low mission salary, and raising five children put extreme stress on his wife. In 1889, Ferguson used the living room of his house in Nanjing for classes; these grew into Huiwen Shuyuan, which in turn evolved into the University of Nanking. In 1897 he was offered a position by Sheng Xuanhuai, a pioneering industrialist and well-connected entrepreneur whom he had met by chance a few years earlier when they were both on a Yangtze river boat. Sheng was impressed by Ferguson's learned Chinese and courtly manner and invited him to found a second western-style school, the Nanyang Public School, Shanghai, a predecessor of the Jiaotong (Transportation) University, which later split into three independent institutions: National Chiao Tung University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Xi'an Jiaotong University. In 1897, to facilitate faculty and students getting to and from the school, he built a road in the Shanghai French Concession with his own salary, which was later named Route Ferguson (now Wukang Road). As Sheng became more influential among government modernizing officials, he arranged posts for Ferguson in the Ministry of Commerce, the Imperial Chinese Railway Administration, and the Ministry of Posts and Communications. With Sheng's backing, Ferguson bought the Sin Wan Bao, which became Shanghai's most successful daily newspaper. The newspaper provided Ferguson with a steady income until he sold it several decades later. In 1902 he returned to Boston University to study for a Ph.D., for which his dissertation was The Confucian Renaissance in the Sung Dynasty. Named honorary secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society (North China branch), he edited their scholarly journal. When Ferguson resigned as president of the Nanyang school, with Sheng Xuanhuai's continuing sponsorship, he became foreign secretary to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce in 1903, and then was official or informal advisor to government bureaus and the chief secretary of the Imperial Chinese Railway Administration until 1907. Taking advantage of his knowledge and connections he began to acquire Chinese art for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Ferguson was a member of the committee to catalog the imperial palace collections of art. In 1914, Ferguson returned to the United States to live in Newton, Massachusetts, but in 1915 accepted a position as adviser to Xu Shichang, who soon became President, which required Ferguson to travel back and forth to China. His lectures at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1918 were published as Outlines of Chinese Art. In 1919, his position as adviser led him to establish a permanent home in Beijing. In 1921, he was adviser for the Chinese delegation to the Washington Conference. His outgoing and friendly character made Ferguson popular, and he served on the editorial committee of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and the Royal Asiatic Society, in whose journals he published extensively. Herbert A. Giles, however, was not charmed. Giles, whose reputation as a sinologist was then at its height, published a devastating review, entitled \\"Another Mistranslator,\\" which included a long list of errors in one of Ferguson's studies and concluded that \\"Dr. Ferguson should either give up translating Chinese poetry or take a few lessons in the book-language.Lawton, quoted from Adversaria Sinica (Shanghai: Kelly and Walsh, 1905) pp. 39-44 Open Library. Ferguson replied in kind: > Dr. Giles has been engaged for so many years in the translation of an > immense number of Chinese phrases and occasionally Chinese paragraphs, that > he might have been expected to look generously upon the faults of others, > when so many of his own have been pointed out to him.... The fellow feeling > of fallibility might have expected to produce in an experienced translator > some hesitation in calling attention to the faults of others, as long as he > could spend his time profitably in revising his own work and correcting his > mistakes. After 1927, with the unification of China under the Kuomintang, he became an adviser to the new government. John Fairbank, who was a student in Beijing in the 1930s, recalls Ferguson as \\"patriarch of Peking's American community,\\" and a \\"big man with impressive white hair and mustache.\\" He had a \\"big house full of servants, with several courtyards and a library plus a curator-teacher,\\" and would supply letters of introduction and firm advice to newcomers. Ferguson stayed in Beijing even after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Ferguson spent his internment in a dormitory in the British Embassy, along with the sinologist and accused forger Edmund Backhouse. In 1943 he was exchanged, along with his daughter Mary. But the arduous voyage to New York by way of Southeast Asia and South America exhausted him. He died in a sanitarium in Clifton Springs, New York, in 1945. Collector and historian of Chinese art In 1912, the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum in New York requested Ferguson to secure \\"representative specimens\\" of Chinese art and supplied him with $25,000. Ferguson assembled an impressive collection of paintings, many from the Qing imperial clan, especially the Manchu prince Duanfang, as well as examples of early bronzes, which, although in later years highly prized, the Trustees of the Metropolitan Museum thought should be housed in an archeological museum, not one of fine arts. The trustees were eager to match or surpass the Asian collection at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, which had been largely assembled by Ernest Fenollosa. Fenollosa, like Ferguson in China, had risen to a position of influence in Japan, but his tastes in Chinese art had been formed by Japanese critics. When the first group of Ferguson's paintings arrived in New York, the trustees turned to a friend of Fenollosa's, who found them \\"rather disappointing\\" and challenged the authenticity or dating of some. When a group was put on exhibition, a newspaper reviewer was surprised that \\"real money was paid\\" for the paintings. Ferguson stoutly defended the paintings and offered to buy back any that the museum found wanting. The Museum asked the opinion of Charles Lang Freer, whose collection would form the core of the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. Freer defended Ferguson and most of the paintings, pointing out that art dealers were trying to discredit Ferguson. When the Metropolitan Museum said that it would not pay even ten dollars for Nymph of the Luo River, Freer quickly bought it for his own collection, Ferguson arranged the sale of several other highly important works to Freer. Ferguson's two pioneering indexes of writings on Chinese art, one for paintings and one for bronzes, were basic references for the next generation of scholars. The catalog on paintings, commonly known as \\"Ferguson's Index,\\" was published at Nanking University in 1934, when Ferguson was sixty-eight years old. and the catalog of writings on bronzes by the Commercial Press in Shanghai in 1939, when he was seventy-three. These volumes indexed references in Chinese catalogs and other writings, in the case of painters, to 2,391 artists based on 108 titles. They drew on Ferguson's own library, art collection, and extensive notes he had made going back to the 1890s, but the work of indexing in Chinese and further work was done by Chinese collaborators. In order to avoid the mistakes that might have been introduced if they copied the entries by hand, they cut entries out of the original volumes and pasted them onto sheets in chronological order and by name of the artist to make a manuscript for the printer. These volumes were unsystematic in the works they had access to and haphazard in their organization, but they made it possible to know the range and nature of Chinese art at a time when most of the important pieces were emerging from imperial or private collections which had not been available to the public or scholars. Ferguson donated many pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but the bulk of his own collection, including bronzes, scrolls, paintings, and jades, was donated to Nanjing University in 1935, and other major gifts were made which are now in the collections of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Thomas Lawton, Senior Research Scholar at the Freer Gallery, concludes that Ferguson made errors which in light of later scholarship seem \\"naive and inexplicable,\\" but \\"more significant than his mistakes are his remarkable contributions\\" and that \\"anyone who studies Chinese art and culture today quickly becomes aware of a profound debt\\" owed to him. The historian Warren Cohen concludes that Freer and Ferguson were primarily responsible for the \\"golden age\\" of East Asian art collecting. Freer's money and taste combined with Ferguson's connections and connoisseurship to make it possible for the American public to see and for American scholars to study a much wider and more representative body of art, and led directly to a shift in American taste away from decorative and ornate works.

This is likely in response to abuse, though whether D'Jeck had a violent nature or was responding to harsh treatment can be the subject of debate. The resulting court proceedings brought much fanfare, but D'Jeck was let off with a small fine.

This led to a successful program called Teach Baltimore. As a result of the growing research on summer learning loss, Teach Baltimore evolved into the Center for Summer Learning at Johns Hopkins University in 2001. In September 2009, the Center transformed into the National Summer Learning Association, an independent organization. Boulay is the founder and former CEO of the National Summer Learning Association, and currently serves on the Board. He is a former elementary school teacher in New York City, he earned a PhD in Sociology and Education from Columbia University‚Äôs Teachers College and was named one of the 25 most influential people in out-of-school time learning. Activities NSLA serves as a network hub for different summer learning programs and others interested in summer learning across the United States. According to their website, their efforts are focused on achieving the following results: * Increase the number of providers offering high-quality summer learning programs to young people living in poverty; * Increase the number of organizations and policymakers that identify summer learning as a public policy priority; and * Increase funding for high-quality summer learning programs for young people who currently lack choices and opportunities. Partners of the NSLA include the American Camp Association and Sylvan Learning. = National Summer Learning Week = National Summer Learning Week is a celebration dedicated to elevating the importance of keeping kids learning, safe, and healthy every summer, ensuring they return to school in the fall ready to succeed in the year. Different themes, including Literacy, STEM, Arts, College and Career Readiness, and Nutrition and Wellness, are highlighted throughout the week, and the NSLA provides toolkits for different activities. = Summer Learning Awards = Candidates for the annual Summer Learning Awards are exceptional summer programs, models, and systems that keep children and youth learning, safe, and healthy during the critical summer months. They show strong outcomes in helping students cement the skills they have learned during the academic school year through creative curricula, unique programming, and effective family engagement strategies. The awards given out by the NSLA are: * New York Life Foundation Excellence in Summer Learning Award, which since 2005 has recognized enrollment-based programs employing staff who work directly with youth. * NSLA Founder‚Äôs Award, which was established in 2015 to recognize informal programs and other non- traditional forms of summer learning innovation that are critical to serving the diverse needs of schools, families, and children. * Climate Change Award, which is new in 2020 and aims to recognize programs that have a special focus on building awareness among youth about the climate change crisis and the importance of environmental stewardship. Reception =Media reception= NSLA has been cited in the many articles discussing summer learning loss and its implications for the achievement gap in the United States in publications including the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he began recalculating Russian economic statistics. His recalculations differed substantially from the official figures, particularly for the value of the capital stock. His work on the economic history of the Soviet Union and Russia has always been controversial, but well grounded in the available (often adjusted by him) statistics. For example, he argued that the New Economic Policy had exhausted itself and that therefore Joseph Stalin's break with it had a serious economic logic.G.I.Khanin (1989). \\"Pochemu i kogda pogib NEP\\", EKO no.10: 66-83. He also argued that Stalin was planning a liberalisation policy shortly before his death.G.I.Khanin (2005). \\" 'Ottepel' i 'perestroika' nachalis pri Staline?\\", EKO no.9 (70-100). Khanin's recalculated statistics were estimated using a variant of the physical indicators method. They were based on the output data for a small number of sectors (e.g., electricity production and freight transport) which were used to generate estimates for mesoeconomic and macroeconomic data. These estimates were checked by using several variant values for the constituent data. Although crude and difficult to replicate, this method may well have given a better picture of the economy than the official data. He has also integrated his alternative statistics into a series of books on the economic history of the Soviet Union and Russia from the late 1930s to 1998. A feature of his work has been the utilisation of a wide range of published sources in both Russian and English. He published a whole book critically evaluating Western estimates of Soviet economic growth and has published a very positive review of Robert William Davies's work on the economic history of the USSR in the 1930s.

It has developed activities in the field of body care/Personal Care and home fragrance, concentrating on soaps, hair care, creams, perfumes, candles and incense, the company is actively implementing environmental and socially conscious policies.  History  In 1976, Paul Pinthon, a young Frenchman who had trained as a pharmacist for several years, developed a single line of incense packets consisting of only 12 fragrances which, was, back then, known as ‚ÄúEncens d‚ÄôAuroville.Aruna V.Iyer, Asha Sridhar, Tuesday, August 17, 2010 \\"A Heady Mix\\" The Hindu-Metro Plus (Chennai, India) page 2 This was one of the first Units of Auroville in existence, created in order to help finance Auroville. Until 1980 the company expanded marginally, but the founder, Paul Pinthon, decided to dedicate his time to something else which resulted in a period of stagnation for the company... Four years later, in 1984, Laura Reddy joined Paul Pinthon and changed the course of the company by combining his training in compounding formulations for fragrances and her knowledge of Aromatherapy. Together they changed the company‚Äôs strategy. Their first act as a changed company was to alter the name to MAROMA. Following which they launched a new range of home fragrances and body care products. On February 24th 1993, in collaboration with Auromode, another unit of Auroville, a store was opened in Pondichery on 134 Mission Street. In addition their products were on display at La Boutique d‚ÄôAuroville (the Store of Auroville) also located in Pondichery. 13 years later on August 23rd 2006 the Kalki Auroville was set up at the Visitor Center of Auroville. In 2010 on the 12th of August, a Maroma store was opened in Chennai in the, at the time, new mall called Express Avenue. The company was transformed into a manufacturer and exporter of a wide range of aromatic products that were made from natural botanical raw materials. In addition they were the first company in India to conform to the guidelines of the International Fragrances Association (IFRA), Brussels. In September of 2009 a book called New Packaging Design by Janice Kirkpatrick was released mentioning the use of Eco-friendly and appealing packaging by Maroma. In April of 2010, the company was recognized as ‚Äúthe largest employer in Auroville,‚Äù with a majority of woman. By 2011 Maroma passed their audit and were granted Membership to the Fair trade India Forum. The company expanded from a domestic operation to an international scale, exporting their products to Japan, Italy, France, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada, USA and the UK. The partnership with their distributor in the UK began in the year 1996, in France in 2000, in Australia by 2009 and in 2011 a new partnership was created with a distributor in South Africa. By June 2001 the company opened a subsidiary through an external contract, Alpharetta, near Atlanta, USA. Then in 2004 everything was shifted to Miami, Florida with a complete change in local management. Although it was only in 2011 that the subsidiary applied to be a member of US fair trade. They were awarded membership the following year, in 2012.  Business  = Key members = Founder/Co-CEO: Paul Pinthon Co-CEO: Laura Reddy received training in Aromatherapy in France. She joined Maroma in 1984. General Manager: Roma Hira She began by marketing Maroma's products to various cities in India, but in 1994 she joined as a General Manager. Design Director: Namrita Gautier = Corporate Social Responsibility =  Fair trade  Maroma's motto has been putting people before machines, and so the work environment is designed to reflect this attitude. They were the first Indian company to operate under the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) Guidelines, Brussels. Later in, 2011, they were officially members of the Fair Trade Forum of India (FTFI) and have been following the Fair trade policies for every person involved with the company, doing such things as maintaining a certain level of safety and cleanliness in the work environment. Maroma has always had a strict no animal testing policy and is firmly against such practices. In addition to their corporate ethics, they try to employ a majority of women from the surrounding villages, provided they have a certain standard of education (12th standard) with the hopes of encouraging the families in the villages to let their daughters finish their education.  Environment  The company does various activities in the effort to reduce their carbon footprint as well as maintain a sustainable business that uses a variety of methods to recycle.Vinita Nayar, September 2010, \\"Maroma Chennai\\" Jade Magazine (India) Page 44 Their packaging reflects and supports their socioeconomic awareness and was noted in Janice Kirkpatrick's book ‚ÄúNew packaging design‚Äù. TANGEDCO (TNEB)approved, for the first time, four solar net-metering applications. All four applications came from Auroville, and one of them was Maroma with a service connection of 15 kW (Kilo Watts). This means the solar power generated at Maroma is feasible and will be connected to the TANGEDCO power grid.  Outlets  = Kalki Pondicherry = Kalki Pondicherry is the result of a collaboration between Paul Pinthon and Laura Reddy of Maroma and Prema Adelino and Andre Hababou of Auromode (another unit of Auroville. The store first opened on 134 mission street, in Pondicherry on February 24, 1993. It has 2 floors that serve as a display and selling points for a variety of companies, but it primarily serves Maroma and Auromode. The shop offers a variety of Maroma's products such as perfumes, incense, aromatherapy, natural oils, flower candles and from Auromode, hand painted silks, cushion covers, scarves and cards. In addition there are various products from other Units of Auroville. = Kalki Auroville = Kalki Auroville was opened in the Visitor Center of Auroville on the 21st of August 2006, 13 years after the first store opening. Just like the first store the primary displays are for Maroma and Auromode but a larger range of products, ranging from organic foods to pottery and metal stone decorative. . = Maroma Chennai = The Maroma Chennai store was only opened on the 12th of August 2010, 4 years after the Auroville branch. The story received more media coverage then the other two. Several magazine articles were published discussing the opening of the store and its natural and organic products.  Head Office  Auroville was a barren undeveloped land at the time, and so after establishing a steady work space with just a few workers who operated out of a small shed, Paul and Laura created an internationally operating home fragrance and body care unit with a subsidiary in the US.Rupa Gopal, September, 2010 \\"Aromas of Auroville\\" Swagat (India) page 134-136 The head office still stands on the site where the first production of their first product, Encens d‚ÄôAuroville, started. It operates with approximately 100 employees, the majority being women from the surrounding villages. The headquarters is more than just the birthplace of Maroma, it also represents the oldest remaining unit of Auroville and the growth of this micro-economic environment. = Founder = Paul Pinthon was born on January 24, 1950 and spent his first 12 years in Algeria. From 1962 till 1974 he lived and studied in France. In France he trained as an assistant pharmacist where he learned the skills required for compounding formulas for fragrances.Rupa Gobal, Friday, January 18, 2008 \\"Sweet Smell\\" Business Line - Life (Chennai, India) Page 4 At the age of 20 he left to join the army working as the army camp's pharmacist. After a year of service he returned to France and continued his education as a pharmacist. In 1974, Paul left France to go to Auroville in India, to start a new life, where he founded Encens d‚ÄôAuroville, the initial unit that would eventually turn into Maroma. In 1980, once his unit was established and running, he decided to shift his focus on to the plantation of trees in Auroville. For a period of 4 years he participated in the planting of 24,000 trees in Auroville. In 1984, Paul and Laura partnered up to make Maroma. They have been running the company ever since as co-CEOs.

Small Wars Journal. Volume 13, No. 4, 11 April 2017, Available here: http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-chibok-kidnappings- in-north-east-nigeria-a-military-analysis-of-before-and-after Retrieved 18 November 2017 Responsibility for the kidnappings was claimed by Boko Haram, an Islamist extremist terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria. 57 of the schoolgirls were rescued by the NA over the next few months and some have described their capture in appearances at international human rights conferences. A child born to one of the girls and believed by medical personnel to be about 20 months old also was released, according to the Nigerian president's office. Since then hopes were raised on various occasions that the 219 remaining girls might be released. Newspaper reports suggested that Boko Haram was hoping to use the girls as negotiating pawns in exchange for some of their commanders in jail. In May 2016, one of the missing girls, Amina Ali, was found. She claimed that the remaining girls were still there, but that six had died. A further 21 girls were freed in October 2016, while another was rescued the next month. Another was found in January 2017. 82 more girls were freed in May 2017. One of the girls was rescued in January 2018. Background The terrorist group Boko Haram wants to institute an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria and is in particular opposed to western-style modern education, which they say lures people away from following Islamic teaching as a way of life. By 2014, tens of thousands of people had been killed in attacks perpetrated by the group, and the Nigerian federal government declared a state of emergency in May 2013 in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in its fight against the insurgency. The resulting crackdown led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they began increasingly to target civilians. However, the campaign failed to stabilise the country. A French military operation in Mali also pushed Boko Haram and AQIM terrorists into Nigeria. Borno State is in northeast Nigeria Boko Haram began to target schools in 2010, killing hundreds of students by 2014. A spokesperson for the group said such attacks would continue as long as the Nigerian government continued to interfere with traditional Islamic education. 10,000 children have been unable to attend school as a result of activities by Boko Haram. Boko Haram has also been known to kidnap girls, whom it believes should not be educated, and use them as cooks or sex slaves. Boko Haram's attacks intensified in 2014. In February, the group killed more than 100 Christian men in the villages of Doron Baga and Izghe. That same month, 59 boys were killed in the Federal Government College attack in northeastern Nigeria. In March, the group attacked the Giwa military barracks, freeing captured militants. The Chibok abduction occurred on the same day as a bombing attack in Abuja in which at least 88 people died. The road leading to Chobok is frequently targeted due to the fact that there is little to no government protection for commuters for the village.Boko Haram was blamed for nearly 4,000 deaths in 2014. Training received from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has helped Boko Haram intensify its attacks. Kidnapping Map of the Boko Haram raid Damage to the school On the night of 14‚Äì15 April 2014, a group of militants attacked the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Nigeria, which is a majority Christian village. They broke into the school, pretending to be guards. According to a diary written by two of the girls (Naomi Adamu and Sarah Samuel) the militants had intended to steal an \\"engine block\\" and were initially unsure what to do with the girls. They told the girls to get out and come with them. Some girls were loaded into trucks and the rest had to walk several miles until other trucks came to take them away possibly into the Konduga area of the Sambisa Forest where Boko Haram were known to have fortified camps. Houses in Chibok were also burned down in the incident. The school had been closed for four weeks prior to the attack due to the deteriorating security situation, but students from multiple schools had been called in to take final exams in physics. There were 530 students from multiple villages registered for the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, although it is unclear how many were in attendance at the time of the attack. The children were aged 16 to 18 and were in their final year of school. There was initial confusion over the number of girls kidnapped but on 21 April 2014, parents said 234 girls were missing. A number of the students escaped the kidnappers by jumping off the trucks. According to the police, approximately 276 children were taken in the attack, of whom 53 had escaped as of 2 May. Other reports said that 329 girls were kidnapped, 53 had escaped and 276 were still missing. Amnesty International said it believes the Nigerian military had four hours' advance warning of the kidnapping, but failed to send reinforcements to protect the school. Nigeria's armed forces have confirmed that the Nigerian military had four-hour advance notice of the attack but said that their over-extended forces were unable to mobilize reinforcements. Jonathan N.C. Hill of King's College London, has pointed out that Boko Haram kidnapped these girls after coming increasingly under the influence of al- Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and asserts that the group's goal is to use girls and young women as sexual objects and as a means of intimidating the civilian population into compliance. Hill describes the attacks as similar to kidnapping of girls in Algeria in the 1990s and early 2000s.Marina Lazreg, \\"Consequences of Political Liberalisation and Sociocultural Mobilisation for Women in Algeria, Egypt and Jordan,\\" in Anne-Marie Goetz, Governing Women: Women‚Äôs Political Effectiveness in Contexts of Democratisation and Governance Reform (New York: Routledge/UNRISD, 2009), p. 47. Aftermath =Events in 2014= right The Christians students, which the overwhelming majority of the kidnapped girls were, were forced to convert to Islam. The girls were forced into marriage with members of Boko Haram, with a reputed \\"bride price\\" of ‚Ç¶2,000 each ($6/¬£4). Many of the students were taken to the neighbouring countries of Chad and Cameroon, with sightings reported of the students crossing borders with the militants, and sightings of the students by villagers living in the Sambisa Forest. The forest was considered a refuge for Boko Haram. Local residents were able to track the movements of the students with the help of contacts across north eastern Nigeria. A diary described how some girls escaped but were returned to Boko Haram by local villagers and whipped. The Guardian reported that the British Royal Air Force conducted Operation Turus in response to the Chibok schoolgirls' kidnapping by Boko Haram in Nigeria in April 2014. A source involved with the Operation told the Observer that \\"The girls were located in the first few weeks of the RAF mission,\\" and that \\"We [RAF] offered to rescue them, but the Nigerian government declined,\\" this was because it viewed the matter as a \\"national issue\\" to be resolved by Nigerian intelligence and security services. On 2 May 2014, police said they were still unclear as to the exact number of students kidnapped. They asked parents to provide documents so an official count could be made, as school records had been damaged in the attack. On 4 May, the Nigerian President, Goodluck Jonathan, spoke publicly about the kidnapping for the first time, saying the government was doing everything it could to find the missing girls. At the same time, he blamed parents for not supplying enough information about their missing children to the police. On 5 May 2014, a video in which Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau claimed responsibility for the kidnappings emerged. Shekau claimed that \\"Allah instructed me to sell them...I will carry out his instructions.\\" and \\"Slavery is allowed in my religion, and I shall capture people and make them slaves.\\" He said the girls should not have been in school and instead should have been married since girls as young as nine are suitable for marriage. Following the kidnapping incident, Boko Haram again abducted another eight girls, aged between 12‚Äì15, from northeastern Nigeria, a number later raised to eleven. Chibok is primarily a Christian village and Shekau acknowledged that many of the girls seized were not Muslims: \\"The girls that have not accepted Islam, they are now gathered in numbers...and we treat them well the way the Prophet Muhammad treated the infidels he seized.\\" On 5 May 2014, at least 300 residents of the nearby town of Gamboru Ngala were killed in an attack by Boko Haram militants after Nigerian security forces had left the town to search for the kidnapped students. On 9 May, former Boko Haram negotiator, Shehu Sani, stated that the group wanted to swap the abducted girls for its jailed members. On 11 May, Kashim Shettima, Governor of Borno State in Nigeria, said that he had sighted the abducted girls and that the girls were not taken across the borders of Cameroon or Chad. On 12 May, Boko Haram released a video showing about 130 kidnapped girls, each clad in a hijab and a long Islamic chador, and demanded a prisoner exchange. In the night from 13 to 14 May, Boko Haram ambushed a military convoy that was searching for the abductees near Chibok, resulting in the death of twelve soldiers. The incident led to mutiny of government forces at Maiduguri, degrading the ability of the Nigerian Army to rescue the schoolgirls. A journalist-brokered deal to secure the release of the girls in exchange for 100 Boko Haram prisoners held in Nigerian jails was scrapped at a late stage on 24 May 2014 after President Goodluck Jonathan consulted with U.S., Israeli, French and British foreign ministers in Paris, where the consensus was that no deals should be struck with terrorists, and that a solution involving force was required. On 26 May, the Nigerian Chief of Defence Staff announced that the Nigerian security forces had located the kidnapped girls, but ruled out a forceful rescue attempt for fears of collateral damage. On 30 May, it was reported that a civilian militia in the Baale region of Northeastern Nigeria found two of the kidnapped girls raped, \\"half-dead,\\" and tied to a tree. Villagers said the Boko Haram group had left the two girls, and killed four other disobedient girls and buried them. 223 were still missing. Sir Andrew Pocock, British High Commissioner to Nigeria said that a couple of months after the kidnapping a group of up to 80 of the Chibok girls were seen by American 'eye in the sky' technology but nothing was done. The girls, a camp and evidence of ground transport vehicles were spotted next to a local landmark called the 'Tree of Life' in the Sambisa forest. On 24 June, it was reported that 91 more women and children were abducted in other areas of Borno State. One source estimated in June that there could be as many as 600 girls held by Boko Haram in three camps outside Nigeria. On 26 June, it was announced that Levick, a Washington, D.C. public relations firm, had received \\"a contract worth more than $1.2 million\\" from the government of Nigeria to work on \\"the international and local media narrative\\" surrounding the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping. On 1 July, a businessman suspected of carrying out the kidnappings of the school girls, as well as the bombing of a busy market in northeastern Nigeria, was arrested. Military sources said that he was also accused of helping the Islamist militant group kill the traditional leader Idrissa Timta, the Emir of Gwoza. On 15 July, Zakaria Mohammed ('the Butcher'), a high-ranking member of Boko Haram, was arrested at Darazo-Basrika Road while fleeing from the counter insurgency operations going on around the Balmo Forest. On 12 October 2014, it was reported that four girls from the original kidnapped group had escaped and walked three weeks to freedom in Nigeria. They said they had been held in a camp in Cameroon and raped every day. =Events in 2015= Stephen Davis, a former Anglican clergyman, contacted three Boko Haram commanders who said they might be prepared to release Chibok schoolgirls and went to Nigeria in April 2015. He was given proof of life (a video of them being raped) and was told 18 were seriously ill, some with HIV. Davis got initial agreement that Boko Haram would release these ill girls. However, after three attempts the deal fell through when another group abducted the girls believing they could make money out of them and Davis left Nigeria. Davis commented that it was not difficult to locate the five or six main Boko Haram camps. He could find them on Google Earth. In May 2015, it was reported that the Nigerian military had reclaimed most of the areas previously controlled by Boko Haram in Nigeria including many of the camps in the Sambisa forest where it was suspected the Chibok girls had been kept. Although many women had been freed, none of the Chibok girls had been found. It was reported that some of the girls had been sold into slavery for N2,000 (about $5) each, others had been forcibly married to Boko Haram fighters and they may have been killed. Kashim Shettima, the Borno state governor said he suspected the Chibok girls were being kept in underground bunkers. =Events in 2016= In January 2016 the Nigerian military were reported to have freed 1,000 women held captive by Boko Haram but none of them were Chibok girls. In April 2016 Boko Haram released a video showing 15 girls who appeared to be some of the kidnapped Chibok girls. The video was apparently taken in December 2015 and the girls seemed to be well fed and not distressed. On 17 May 2016, Amina Ali Nkeki, one of the girls was found along with her baby and Mohammad Hayyatu, a suspected Boko Haram militant who claimed to be her husband, by the vigilante Civilian Joint Task Force group in the Sambisa Forest. All three were suffering from severe malnutrition. She was then taken to house of the group's leader Aboku Gaji who recognised her. The group then reunited the girl with her parents. She met Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari on 19 May. Government officials announced the same day that the Nigerian army and vigilante groups had killed 35 Boko Haram militants, freed 97 women and children and claimed one of the women was a Chibok schoolgirl. However, there were doubts that this girl, Serah Luka, was really one of the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls. On 21 May 2016, Amir Muhammad Abdullahi, who claimed to be the Boko Haram second in command and speaker for several senior militants, offered to surrender so long as they would not be harmed and in return they would release hostages including the Chibok girls. However he said of Chibok girls; \\"...frankly, just about a third of them remain, as the rest have been martyred\\". In August 2016 Boko Haram released a video of what appeared to be about 50 Chibok girls, some of them holding babies, with an armed masked spokesman who demanded the release of jailed fighters in exchange for the girls' freedom, The masked gunman said some of the Chibok girls had been killed by Nigerian air strikes and 40 had been married. The film was apparently released on the orders of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of one of the factions of Boko Haram. In October 2016, 21 of the Chibok schoolgirls had been freed by Boko Haram after negotiations between the group and the Nigerian government brokered by International Committee of the Red Cross and the Swiss government. On 16 October, President Buhari's spokesperson stated that the ISIL-allied faction of Boko Haram was willing to negotiate the release of 83 more of the girls. According to him, the splinter group had stated that the rest of the girls were under the control of Shekau-led faction. 2 days later, Pogu Bitrus, the chairman of the Chibok Development Association, claimed that more than 100 of the missing girls apparently did not want to return home because they had either been brainwashed or were fearful of the stigma they will receive. Another girl named Maryam Ali Maiyanga was found and rescued by the Nigerian Army on 5 November along with a baby by the Nigerian Army. The spokesman for the Army, Sani Usman, said that they discovered her in Pulka of Borno state while screening escapees from Boko Haram's Sambisa forest base. She was confirmed to be one of the kidnapped girls by Bring Back Our Girls. =Events in 2017= U.S. President Donald J. Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Chibok schoolgirls Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu at the White House on 27 June 2017. One of the kidnapped girls, Rakiya Abubakar, was reported on 5 January 2017 to have been found by the Nigerian Army along with a 6-month-old baby while they were interrogating suspects detained in army raids on the Sambisa forest. Her identity was later confirmed by Bring Back Our Girls group. On 6 May 82 of the schoolgirls were released following successful negotiations between the Nigerian government involving the exchange of five Boko Haram leaders. The negotiations were carried by Mustapha Zanna, barrister and owner of an orphanage in Maiduguri. The deal also involved the intervention of the Swiss government and the Red Cross. 3 million Euros (about 3.7 million US$) were paid as ransom money in two duffel bags for the total of 103 girls released in October 2016 and May 2017. A Nigerian government spokesman stated that though originally 83 girls were to be released in May 2017, one of them chose to stay with her husband instead of being freed. =Events in 2018= The Nigerian military stated on 4 January 2018 that it had rescued Salomi Pogu, one of the kidnapped girls. Col. Onyema Nwachukwu stated that she was rescued near Pulka village in Borno. Her name was in the list of the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls. She was found in the company of another young woman and her child. In February 2018 most of the released girls were studying at the American University of Nigeria not far from the original scene of the kidnapping at Chibok. It was estimated that 13 girls were presumed dead and 112 were still missing. In September 2018, Ali Garga, a Boko Haram militant, offered to free 40 of the remaining Chibok schoolgirls. However, he was tortured and killed by other Boko Haram members when they found out what he was doing. Reaction A truck in Nigeria promotes the#BringBackOurGirls hash tag launched to spread awareness of the kidnapping The former First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, holds a sign with the #BringBackOurGirls hash tag, posted to her official Twitter account, helping to spread the awareness of the kidnapping. Nigerian artist Sarah Peace created a public art installation in Epping Forest depicting the missing girls with black veiled figures After the kidnapping, Governor Kashim Shettima demanded to visit Chibok, despite being advised that it was too dangerous. The military was working with vigilantes and volunteers to search the forest near the Nigeria‚ÄìCameroon border on 21 April. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon and UNICEF condemned the abduction, as did former Nigerian military ruler Muhammadu Buhari. The UN Security Council also condemned the attack and warned of action against Boko Haram militants for abducting the girls. Parents and others took to social media to complain about the government's perceived slow and inadequate response. The news caused international outrage against Boko Haram and the Nigerian government. On 30 April and 1 May, protests demanding greater government action were held in several Nigerian cities. Most parents, however, were afraid to speak publicly for fear their daughters would be targeted for reprisal. On 3 and 4 May, protests were held in major Western cities including Los Angeles and London. A lawyer in Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, started the hash tag #BringBackOurGirls, which began to trend globally on Twitter and the story spread rapidly internationally, becoming for a time Twitter's most tweeted hashtag. By 11 May it had attracted 2.3 million tweets and by 2016 it had been retweeted 6.1 million times. A woman who helped organise protests was detained by the police, apparently because the First Lady of Nigeria, Patience Jonathan, felt slighted when the woman showed up for a meeting instead of the mothers of victims. The woman was released soon after. Reports said the First Lady had further incensed protesters by suggesting some abduction reports were faked by Boko Haram supporters. Several online petitions were created to pressure the Nigerian government to act against the kidnapping. On 30 April, hundreds marched on the National Assembly to demand government and military action against the kidnappers. The president of the Muslim Students Society of Nigeria called on Muslims to fast and pray \\"in order to seek Allah's intervention in this precarious time.\\" Sa'ad Abubakar III, the Sultan of Sokoto, also called for prayers and intensified efforts to rescue the students. On 9 May, Governor Kashim Shettima of Borno State called on all Muslims and Christians to join in \\"three days of prayers and fasting.\\" On the same day, Muslims in Cameroon called on fellow believers not to marry any of the girls should they be offered to them. On the same day, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh, joined other religious leaders in the Muslim world in condemning the kidnappings, describing Boko Haram as misguided and intent on smearing the name of Islam. He stated that Islam is against kidnapping, and that marrying kidnapped girls is not permitted. The scale of the kidnapping was unprecedented, which led former United States Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell to declare that Boko Haram's strength \\"appears to be increasing. The government's ability to provide security to its citizens appears to be decreasing.\\" Director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, J. Peter Pham, said \\"The failure of the government to even get a clear count further reinforces a perception of systemic governmental failure\\". The Economist \\"labeled President Goodluck Jonathan as incompetent,\\" saying that Jonathan and the Nigerian military \\"cannot be trusted any longer to guarantee security for Nigerians,\\" adding that \\"the worst aspect of the Nigerian government‚Äôs handling of the abduction is its seeming indifference to the plight of the girls‚Äô families. It took more than two weeks before Jonathan addressed the matter in public.\\" Jonathan later attributed his silence to his desire not to compromise the details of security efforts carried out to rescue the girls. President Jonathan also engaged a public relations firm, Levick, for $1.2m to improve the public presentation of his handling of the crisis. On 22 July, the militant group again attacked the nearby villages, killing at least 51 people including 11 parents of the abducted girls. On 23 and 24 July, vigils and protests were held around the world to mark 100 days since the kidnapping. Participating countries included Nigeria, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Togo, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Portugal. A Human Rights Watch report released on 27 October 2014 claims, The report also claims, \\"The relative ease with which Boko Haram carried out the Chibok abductions seems to have emboldened it to step up abductions elsewhere.\\" As of 5 January 2015, daily rallies by Bring Back Our Girls demonstrators at the Unity Fountain in Abuja were continuing, despite police efforts to shut them down. On 13 April 2015 hundreds of protesters wearing red tape across their lips walked silently through the capital Abuja marking a year since Boko Haram kidnapped the girls. On 29 May 2015, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in his inaugural address to the nation said that they could not claim to \\"have defeated Boko Haram without rescuing the Chibok girls and all other innocent persons held hostage by insurgents. [The] government will do all it can to rescue them alive.\\" On 12 June 2015, two weeks after President Buhari was sworn in, he and his wife Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, and the Vice President's wife Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo met with some mothers of the abducted Chibok girls, a meeting Mrs. Buhari had wanted to hold for a long time. On 1 October 2015 the Nigerian Military said it would not be in a hurry to rescue the secondary schoolgirls in Chibok who were abducted in April 2014. The Acting Director, Defence Information, Military Headquarters, Abuja, Col. Rabe Abubakar, who said this at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday, noted that while it was of utmost concern to the military to rescue the girls, the operation required demanded adequate patience and planning. In December 2015 Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian President, said that he was willing to negotiate with Boko Haram for the release of the Chibok girls without any preconditions. On the 600th day of the Chibok girls' abduction, a group of Nigeria experts in the United Kingdom called Nigeria Diaspora Security Forum called on the Federal Government of Nigeria under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a special taskforce tasked solely with the responsibility of looking for the girls. In 2016 one newspaper article commented that the international publicity for the Chibok schoolgirls has ironically made it more difficult to free the girls. A Nigerian military commander based in Maiduguri commented \\"Boko Haram sees the Chibok girls as their trump card. We think they are keeping them with their main leadership. The day we get the Chibok girls will spell the end of Boko Haram, but I fear they will kill all the girls in mass suicide bombings in the process.\\" The fifth anniversary of Chibok school abduction in 2019 marked the vulnerability of schoolchildren to such attacks and abductions, since the whereabouts of 112 girls still remain missing. Human Rights Watch research claims that the abductions done by Boko Haram started prior to the Chibok incident and have continued ever since. ‚ÄúBoko Haram continues to prey on women and girls as spoils of war despite claims by the Nigerian government that it has defeated the group,‚Äù said Human Rights Watch's Nigeria researcher. Social media and celebrity involvement The global response to this movement started off as a handful of tweets by Nigerian citizens and government officials.Collins, 2017 A Nigerian lawyer made the first post on 14 April 2014. The movement even started off with a $300,000 cash reward to anyone who could help locate or rescue the girls from their kidnappers. Shortly after this, many celebrities joined in on social media holding pieces of paper with the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. The social media movement resulted in offline protests around the world, including this one in Spain. Numerous celebrities were photographed holding up signs in photographs showing support for the Bring Back our Girls movement, including Salma Hayek, Bradley Cooper, Antonio Banderas, Gerard Butler, Kelsey Grammer, Wesley Snipes, Sylvester Stallone, Ronda Rousey, Mel Gibson, Simon Baker, Ricky Martin, Eva Longoria, Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Ben Stiller, Justin Timberlake, Sean Combs, Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, Sean Penn, Alicia Keys, Ellen DeGeneres, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Anne Hathaway, and Malala Yousafzai. Notably, Beyonc√© had a separate section on her website that was dedicated to the movement. It stated: \\"In light of recent events, CHIME FOR CHANGE is raising money to distribute organizations working in Nigeria to support girl‚Äôs education. You can help the cause by donating 10$ now, by texting BRINGBACK - You can also donate online to #ChimeIn and help bring back our girls. International governmental response * ‚Äì Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper acknowledged that Canadians had joined the international effort to free the schoolgirls. Details about the extent and duration of the involvement had been kept secret. * ‚Äì China announced its intention to make available \\"any useful information acquired by its satellites and intelligence services.\\" * ‚Äì The European Union passed a resolution on 17 July, \\"calling for immediate and unconditional release of the abducted schoolgirls.\\" * ‚Äì France offered a specialist team. French President Francois Hollande also offered to hold a summit in Paris with Nigeria and its neighbours to tackle the issue. * ‚Äì Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered assistance to the Nigerian President in locating the missing pupils on 11 May 2014. \\"Israel expresses its deep shock at the crime committed against the girls. We are willing to help assist in locating the girls and fighting the terror that is afflicting you,\\" he said. According to an unnamed Israeli official, the Prime Minister later sent a team of intelligence experts to Nigeria. It contained people experienced in dealing with hostage situations, but he said they \\"are not operational troops, they're there to advise.\\" A joint U.S.-Israel project, which modified the Beechcraft C-12 Huron aircraft for electronic warfare and reconnaissance, was being used and \\"may prove decisive in finding the girls,\\" according to one source.\\"Electronic Weapons: A King Air Listens For The Lost Girls\\", Strategypage, 18 May 2014 * ‚Äì The United Kingdom agreed to send experts to Nigeria to assist in the search for the students. The British experts were to be drawn from various governmental departments including the Foreign Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence, and would concentrate on planning, co-ordination and advice to local authorities. A Royal Air Force Sentinel R1 reconnaissance aircraft has been deployed to Ghana to assist in the search. * ‚Äì The United States agreed to send experts to Nigeria to assist in the search for the students. The American team consists of military and law enforcement officers, specializing in \\"intelligence, investigations, hostage negotiation, information-sharing and victim assistance.\\" The US is not considering sending armed forces. Former Nigerian Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, and Dr. Babangida Aliyu, chairman of the Northern Governor's Forum, \\"welcomed the US government‚Äôs offer of military assistance.\\" On 12 May, 16 military personnel from US African Command joined the Search and Rescue Operations. On 22 May, the Department of Defense announced that it was deploying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and 80 United States Air Force personnel to nearby Chad. Chad was chosen as a base for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance flights because of its access to northern Nigeria. 2018 abduction In February 2018, approximately four years after the 2014 Chibok abduction, in the nearby town of Dapchi again another 110 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram, with no government intervention intercepting the abductors yet .Boko Haram Has Kidnapped Dozens of Schoolgirls, Again.

The school is owned and operated by Auckland-based private education company ACG Schools (formerly known as Academic Colleges Group). The school opened at the beginning of the 2015 school year, and initially offered places for Year 1-9 students. It now offers education from preschool-Year 13. It is the first private school in Tauranga since Tauranga Rudolf Steiner School integrated into the state system in March 2005. It is the latest of Academic Colleges Group's 10 schools, whose New Zealand schools are members of Independent Schools of New Zealand (ISNZ). Thea Kilian is the current principal, transferring from her role as Deputy Principal from Auckland's Long Bay College. Background The school was announced via press release from ACG in August, 2013. It is ACG's first domestic school outside of the Auckland region. Of ACG's existing domestic schools, ACG Tauranga is closest in nature to ACG Strathallan in Papakura, south of Auckland, which opened in 2001. The development was initially opposed by the Tauranga City Council, however work was underway in February 2014. The school covers 14 hectares, formerly a kiwifruit orchard. Amenities will include a gymnasium, three sports fields, a utility building, and parking. As well as hard courts, a sports pavilion, horticultural building and an Early Childhood Education centre. The first public meeting was held in April 2014 at Trinity Wharf Hotel in Tauranga. ACG claims over 200 parents and teachers attended from across the Bay of Plenty.' In 2016, construction of the new three-storey gymnasium began. It was completed in May 2017. Curriculum The curriculum is aligned closely to the Cambridge International programme. As with all domestic ACG schools, ACG Tauranga offers the Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) instead of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA). Its first cohort of Year 13 students achieved a 100% pass rate in all A Level subjects in 2019. Schools The school is divided into Junior (Year 1‚Äì6), Middle (Year 7-9) and Senior (Year 10-13) Schools. It also has a preschool.

The nets can be flat or shaped like a bag, a rectangle, a pyramid, or a cone. Lift nets can be hand-operated, boat-operated, or shore- operated. They typically use bait or a light-source as a fish-attractor. Lift nets are also sometimes called \\"dip nets\\", though that term applies more accurately to hand nets. Types =Portable hand lift nets= Portable hand lift nets are small lift nets operated manually. They usually have a rigid frame which is attached to a long pole. They are used primarily to catch fish and crustaceans, and may be submerged just below the water surface or close to the bottom. A person using hand lift nets usually operate it from the shore, on bridges, and from harbor walls. =Shore-operated stationary lift nets= Stationary lift nets are larger than hand lift nets and are attached permanently to a shore-built structure. Lifting the nets may be done by hand through the use of counterweights, or they may use mechanized winches. Bait or a strong source of light is placed in the middle of the net. They are typically placed near beaches or riverbanks. =Boat-operated lift nets= Boat-operated lift nets are lift nets operated from water vessels.

Life and career Mick Shann was born in the Melbourne suburb of Kew on 22 November 1917. His father was Frank Shann, a respected teacher and headmaster. He studied Arts at the University of Melbourne, where he was in residence at Trinity College from 1936 to 1936, winning the Alcock Scholarship.Fleur-de-Lys, Nov. 1936, pp. 7, 11. Shann's first Commonwealth Public Service positions were at the Bureau of Census and Statistics in 1939 and the Department of Labour and National Service from 1940 to 1946. In 1946, he moved to the Department of External Affairs in Canberra to take up an appointment as second secretary of the United Nations Division in the department. In 1955, Shann was appointed Minister to the Philippines. From 1962 to 1966 Shann was Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, during the time of the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation. Shann perceived \\"clouds of mistrust\\" preventing close ties between the neighbouring countries at the time, suggesting that Indonesians were \\"puzzled at Australia being a European outcrop on the edge of Asia\\", but that Australia had no reason to fear Indonesia. In 1970, Shann was appointed a Deputy Secretary in the Department of External Affairs, shortly before it was renamed the Department of Foreign Affairs. In this role until 1973, he worked alongside Departmental secretary Keith Waller to raise the department's reputation and morale. During his time in the Deputy Secretary role, he insisted that the department's staff should go back on regular Public Service classifications and salary levels and the formal separation between diplomatic and administrative foreign affairs staff should be abolished. Shann was appointed Australian Ambassador to Japan in 1973. From Japan, he was appointed chairman of the Public Service Board, commencing in the role from 28 March 1977. After 17 months as board chairman, Shann resigned from the Public Service at age 60, citing personal and family reasons. Shann died on 4 August 1988, at 70 years of age. Awards and honours Shann was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1964 while he was Ambassador in Jakarta. He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in June 1980. In 2012, a street in the Canberra suburb of Casey was named Mick Shann Terrace in Shann's honour.

Plot  This is one of the rare movies in Kannada cinema history. The movie starts with a song and also ends with a song and dance. This is probably the first time in Kannada cinema where the director uses a song to complete the climax for the movie. Sagar (Vishnuvardhan) is a good singer and dancer. He starts searching for Suma (Prema) in a huge crowd. When the crowd starts wondering why is he looking for her commences the first flashback, which is one among the seven or so flashbacks in the movie. Sagar is a nice guy who has taken up drinking due to failure in his love life. Suma lands at Sagar's place to learn bharathanatyam from his father, who is an expert. She tries to find out why Sagar has stopped singing. This leads to another flashback where Sagar explains as to how he was ditched by Sudha (Roja) and also narrates how he lost his mother. This forced him to stop singing and take up drinking. Sagar finally takes up singing after much persuasion from Prema and returns back to the singing family. He also agrees to give a comeback show, but insists on Suma's presence in that show. Suma never turns up for the show. Here begins the search for her. He sets a deadline through a TV performance to Suma. Suma turns up to Sagar's place and this leads to another flashback where she narrates as to why she couldn't attend the performance a year back. Bhattacharya is a very good singer. He and Suma‚Äôs father (Dattatreya) have an argument because Bhattacharya‚Äôs father insisted on his daughter winning the competition and forces him to go for a particular raga. This irritates Suma‚Äôs father and he leaves the huge hall in a rage. He meets with an accident and dies. Bhattacharya insists on Suma not attending Sagar's performance as that will harm the growth of his daughter's image and that's the reason Suma doesn't turn up to Sagar's show (all this was a flashback). The rest of the movie is about the clash between Sagar and Bhattacharya. This leads to the climax song which is of 11-13 minutes duration and how he defeats Bhattacharya in a competition.

Becher and set to music by Hanns Eisler.  History  When, in 1949, the German Democratic Republic was founded in the aftermath of the second world war, German communists sought to boost the picture of the GDR being the first anti-Fascist state on German soil. Unlike West Germany, the GDR never recognized its responsibility for the atrocities committed by the Third Reich as it regarded itself as a new socialist national entity that had defeated National Socialism.Benz, Wolfgang (ed.). Deutschland unter alliierter Besatzung 1945‚Äì1949. Die DDR 1949‚Äì1990. 10th edition: 2009. Page XXII. This official state myth thus enabled the growth of a strong patriotism in the east whereas the FRG had and still has a difficult relationship to its own national identity.K√∂nig, Daniel. Patriotismus in Deutschland. Diplomica Verlag: Hamburg, 2012. Page 63. As the GDR still wanted to reunify Germany in its early years, patriotic and propaganda songs constantly mentioned the country as a whole. Especially in the 1950s, patriotic songs praising Germany, German unity and the future of a new, democratic nation were produced and promoted by the GDR government, the socialist party and its sub-organizations. One of these songs was the Song of the Blue Flag which referred to the flag of the party's youth organisation, the Freie Deutsche Jugend. Its authors, Hanns Eisler and Johannes R. Becher, had also written East Germany's national anthem and other patriotic songs.Heimb√∂ckel, Dieter. Uwe Werlein (ed.). Verlag K√∂nigshausen & Neumann: W√ºrzburg, 2005. Der Bildhunger der Literatur. Festschrift f√ºr Gunter E. Grimm. Page 308. The official attitude of the socialist government towards Germany changed in 1974 when the constitution was modified and all passages referring to the country as a whole or the GDR as a \\"socialist state of the German nation\\" were effaced. Hence, the lyrics of the national anthem exalting \\"Germany, our united fatherland\\" fell out of use, too, as did all songs about a united Germany thad had hitherto been sung.Weber, Hermann.

History In the early 1870s, a station was built by the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalberstadt Railway Company (, MHE) as the Bahnhof am Friesentore (station at Friesentore) and later operated as the Altenbekener Bahnhof (station of the Altenbeken Railway). The first freight train left it on 19 May and the first passenger train left it on 30 June 1875 at a cruising speed of 30 km/h. The station was necessary because the HAE was not allowed to use the state railway station (close to the current Hildesheim Hauptbahnhof). In 1880, the HAE was nationalised. After trains began to use the state station from 20 May 1880, the station was closed and all buildings were demolished except the goods shed. The station building was rebuilt in Bad Lauterberg. After persistent protests from the citizenry and the collection of funds amounting to 12,000 marks, the mayor of the city of Hildesheim was presented with another 3000 marks for the re-establishment of the station. The new station was opened in the former goods shed on 1 May 1893. The malt factory was opened on the site of today's nursing home in Immengarten in 1878. Gl√ºckauf, a coal trader on the corner of Immengarten and Gravelottestra√üe, opened its own railway siding in 1897. In World War II, the station was slightly damaged by an air raid on 22 February 1945. By 1963 there was a separate station bookstore. A new station building was built in 1967 and the newest signal-box in Hildesheim was housed in it in 1978. All sets of points and sidings were closed in 1988. As a result, the east station has is now classified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Subsequently the island platform was replaced by a second side platform and connected by a pedestrian bridge over the tracks, which made a barrier between the two through tracks superfluous; these had been manually operated for a long time. A ticket machine was also installed. The demolition of the station building in 1990 created a vacant lot.

When the original construction of the castle occurred is unclear; some sources claim it was as early as the 12th century. However, the consensus among historians is that the Van Herlaer family completed the castle in the 1350s. At the time of its construction, the castle was built along a branch of the River Maas. Just a few years after the construction of the castle was completed, the river was rerouted leaving the castle to be surrounded by a moat.  Architecture  Ammersoyen Castle in ca. 2010 The castle was designed to be a defensive fortress. When it was originally constructed, it had a central courtyard, surrounded by four heavy towers on the corners. Connecting these four towers were four heavy wings, one on each side of the courtyard. Ammersoyen Castle is a good example of the type of castle that was made famous by Count Floris V of Holland. Even though it was originally built on a river, the Van Herlaers believed that all four sides of the castle needed to be fortified. To add to the security, the original design included a moat that ensured any attacker could only invade through the front of the fortress. Except for a brief period in the early 20th century, the castle has always been completely surrounded by the moat. The castle was built using a fixed plan, something that was quite uncommon for medieval castles. A fixed plan means that the entire castle was built as a whole, as opposed to multiple phases, which was often the case with other medieval castles.  Location  Ammersoyen on a map of ca. 1534 The earliest mention of Ammerzoden, or Ambersoi as it was once known, was in the 11th century. Given that the village was built on a river with very arable lands, it was most likely just a small farming community with little importance until the creation of the castle in the 14th century. Today, the village is home to approximately 4000 people, and since 1999 has been part of the municipality of Maasdriel. Prior to 1999, Ammerzoden was its own municipality.  History  = 14th century‚Äì16th century = Dirk Van Herlaer, of the Van Herlaer family, built the castle in the 1350s. Upon Dirk's death in 1354, the castle was passed onto his eldest son, Gerhard. Over the next 30 years the castle passed hands numerous times within the family. When Gerhard died, the castle was passed onto his brother, Arent. Gerhard had no children to claim the castle as part of their inheritance, which is the reason it was passed to his brother. When Arent died in 1384, the castle was given to his son, Arent Hoeman. It is under Arent Hoeman where the Van Herlaer's lost control of the castle for good. The castle is located in the province of Gelderland, the Netherlands. In the late 14th century, Duke William of Gelder's and Julich controlled Gelderland. Arent Hoeman was one of the most trusted friends of Duke William. In 1386 a war broke out due to a land dispute between Gelderland and the Duchy of Brabant. The Burgundians were aggressively trying to expand their territory at this time, and tried to take over parts of Gelderland. Archaeological findings from the moat on display in the castle Despite his close relationship with Duke William, Arent Hoeman sided with the Duchess of Brabant. William, unsurprisingly, saw this as an act of betrayal and abruptly ended his friendship with Arent Hoeman. Just days later, Duke William invaded Ammerzoden, capturing both Arent Hoeman and the castle. Thus, in 1386 the castle came under the control of Duke William. Following the end of the war, Duke Williams gave the castle to his illegitimate son in 1405. His son did not hold the castle for long, as he sold it to Johan Van Broeckhuysen, lord of the Waardenburg, in 1424. The castle only changed hands by marriage for the next 400 years. In 1496, Johan Van Broeckhuysen married Otto Van Arkel, which ended up giving the Van Arkel family control of the castle for centuries. The Van Arkel family was a well-known and quite wealthy family in the region at the time of the wedding. At the end of their rule, the Van Arkels had controlled the castle for five generations. In 1513, during the Guelderian Wars, the Habsburgs attempted to seize control of the castle from across the River Maas, and briefly occupied the castle. Burgundian troops, led by Count Henrick Van Nassau, occupied the castle for a brief time in the mid-16th century. During the siege and subsequent occupation, the castle was moderately damaged and a large amount of personal property needed to be replaced. At this point in their rule, the Van Arkels were still very rich, so they had the means to repair the castle. The castle's ruins in ca. 1625‚Äì1650 The castle was also occupied for a short time again in 1572, when the Spanish invaded the Netherlands. However, the castle was not held long by the Spanish, as Prince Willem Van Oranje and his troops were able to drive the Spanish troops out. This liberation of the castle kept the damage inflicted by the Spanish to a minimum. By 1590, the castle was fully repaired and it was once again almost destroyed, this time by a fire. The lord of the castle at the time, Joris Van Arkel, died from injuries that he sustained during the fire. = 18th century‚Äìpresent = Due to a shortage of money, the Van Arkels were not able to rebuild the castle until the 17th century. This fire took place during the 80 years war and caused the family to have very uncertain feelings about its economic future. Therefore, it was not until the end of the 80 years war in the middle of the 17th century that large-scale renovations would start on the castle.  Architectural changes  Once the Van Arkels regained enough wealth to rebuild the castle the original architecture had become obsolete. As a result, the family made severe changes to the original layout of the castle. They restored the outside to essentially the same design as the original, but changed they inside considerably. Given how much architectural styles had changed since the castle was founded, is very surprising that the then lord, Thomas Walraven Van Arkel, chose to restore the outside with traditional medieval style. Given the changes in architectural styles, the interior of the castle was transformed to a much more comfortable living space. The original Castle had traditional, large rooms with high ceilings. Among these large rooms was the large knights hall. These sorts of rooms were very common in medieval castles. When the Van Arkels repaired the castle they got rid of the grand hall, elected to have numerous, smaller rooms instead. In general, the renovations of the castle reduced the size of the rooms and made them shorter. Numerous fireplaces and other more modern amenities were included in the restorations. One of the few changes to the exterior of the castle was adding more windows. Because the original Castle was built primarily for defense, there were not many windows as they made the fortress more vulnerable during attacks.  French invasion  Ammersoyen Castle in 1734 Not long after the rebuilding was completed in mid-17th century, King Louis XIV of France invaded the Netherlands. This invasion was during the Franco-Dutch War, or the Dutch War as it is commonly referred to. This War was, in part, started in response to the Dutch signing an alliance with the Spanish and English against the French in the War of Devolution in the 1660s. King Louis XIV saw this as a betrayal from the Dutch and decided to invade the Dutch in response. By the time the French soldiers arrived at the castle in 1672, the Van Arkels were able to regain some of their prior wealth. As the French made their way through the Dutch countryside, they destroyed numerous castles. The French soldiers also threatened to destroy the Ammersoyen Castle, but Thomas Van Arkel was able to buy the castle's safety from the French by offering the French commanding officer 7000 guilders. While this ensured the castle's safety, it left the Van Arkels in a severe amount of debt. This debt meant that the final interior redecorating under the Van Arkels could not be completed. In 1693, following the death of the last Van Arkels, Thomas, the castle came into the hands of a number of other Dutch families over the next century. The owners of the castle during this period were often very rich families who had various estates throughout the region and spent little time at the castle. Ammersoyen Castle in ca. 1868 The last of the families to own the castle was the Woelmont family, in the mid-19th century. The last lord of Ammersoyen was Arthuer de Woelmont, who bought the castle in 1856. Over the course of the next 17 years, he eventually sold all of the possessions of the castle, and in 1873 he sold the castle to the Roman Catholic Church in Ammerzoden. By 1876, the castle was transformed into a convent for use by the Poor Clares. The castle thus became the second Clarisse Convent in the Netherlands. The nuns made significant changes to the grounds when they lived in the castle. The moat was filled in and a chapel was built on the grounds, which is still there today. The start of World War II led to the end to the convent as the area was bombed heavily. Much of the castle and grounds were destroyed during the Allied bombings of WWII. The castle allowed the people of the town a place to seek shelter during the war, although by the end of the war, not much of the castle was left standing. After the war, a local businessman used the castle as a factory that produced washing machines. Room in the castle in 2011 In 1957, the Friends of Gelderland Castles Foundation bought the castle and made extensive repairs. Over the course of the next 16 years, they were able to restore the castle to its original medieval construction. This meant undoing many of the structural changes that have taken place over the centuries. While this sounds like a very difficult job, many of the changes that had taken place were actually just covered up by plaster and bricks. So recovering the original layout was actually not that taxing. They have restored the rooms to their original size and height, reconstructed chimneys, and moved staircases. The foundation was able to recover numerous artifacts from throughout the castle's history by digging up the filled in moat. Among the pieces found were fragments of pottery, stoneware, glass, silver, bronze, and tin. These artifacts are now on display in the castle's attic. The castle and grounds were fully restored by 1976, and today it is open to the public for tours and other functions. From 1976 until 1999 the castle was used not only as a tourist attraction, but also as an official town hall and meeting place for the local municipality. After the Ammerzoden municipality ceased to exist in 1999, the meetings were moved from the castle.  References  * \\"Ammersoyen Castle.\\" Ammersoyen Castle. Castles on the Web, n.d.

Retrieved November 4, 2018. = Research on labour economics, discrimination and gender gaps= One key area of Bertrand's research is labour economics, in particular racial and gender discrimination. Together with Sendhil Mullainathan, she finds that the introduction of antitakeover legislation, which shield companies somewhat from competition, in the 1980s raised wages by 1‚Äì2%, thus suggesting that managers have some discretion in wage setting.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (1999). Is there discretion in wage setting? A test using takeover legislation. Rand Journal of Economics, 30(3), pp. 535‚Äì554. In a seminal contribution to research on racial labour market discrimination, Bertrand and Mullainathan manipulate perceived race on fictitious resumes sent in reply to help-wanted ads by using Afro- American- or Caucasian-sounding names and observe that \\"white names\\" receive 50% more callbacks for interviews, a finding that holds robustly across occupations, industries, firm sizes and controls for social class.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2004). Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal? A field experiment on labor market discrimination. American Economic Review, 94(4), pp. 991‚Äì1013. Relatedly, Bertrand, Mullainathan and Dolly Chugh have argued for the existence of implicit discrimination, which ‚Äì unlike taste-based or statistical discrimination ‚Äì is unintentional and of which the discriminator is unaware.Bertrand, M., Chugh, D., Mullainathan, S. (2005). Implicit discrimination. American Economic Review, 95(2), pp. 94‚Äì98. In another exploration of racial discrimination, Bertrand, Mullainathan and David Abrams find that judges in Illinois vary in the degree to which race influences their sentencing, with smaller gaps between white and Afro-American incarceration rates for Afro-American judges and judges passing comparatively many incarceration sentences also being disproportionately likely to sentence Afro-Americans to jail.Abrams, D.S., Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2012). Do judges vary in their treatment of race? Journal of Legal Studies, 41(2), pp. 347‚Äì383. Studying the impact of entry regulation on job creation in France with Francis Kramarz, Bertrand finds that regional zoning boards' tendency to deter the creation or extension of retail stores increased retailer concentration and slowed down employment growth.Bertrand, M., Kramarz, F. (2002). Does entry regulation hinder job creation? Evidence from the French retail industry. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(4), pp. 1369‚Äì1413. In another study of the impact of infra-industry competition on wages, Bertrand finds that growth in import competition makes workers' wages more sensitive to the current unemployment rate and less sensitive to the unemployment rate that prevailed at the time they were hired, thus suggesting that import competition may erode the implicit contracts between employers and their employees.Bertrand, M. (2004). From the invisible handshake to the invisible hand? How import competition changes the employment relationship. Journal of Labor Economics, 22(4), pp. 723‚Äì765. Analysing the gender gap with Kevin Hallock, Bertrand observes that in 1992‚Äì97 only 2.5% of top executives in US firms were women and that they earned on average 45% less than men, with up to 75% of that gap being explained by differences in the size of the managed firms and women's lower likelihood to be CEO, Chair or President, though she also finds that female participation in top executive positions nearly tripled during that period; nonetheless, Bertrand and Hallock stress that gender discrimination via segregation or unequal promotion cannot be ruled out.Bertrand, M., Hallock, K.F. (2001). The gender gap in top corporate jobs. ILR Review, 55(1), pp. 3‚Äì21. Further exploring the issue of gender pay gaps with Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, Bertrand finds that although the earnings of male and female MBAs are nearly identical at the beginning of their careers, ten years later, male earnings are almost 60 log points higher, with most of the gap being explained by differences in pre-MBA training, career interruptions and weekly hours, the latter two being mostly due to motherhood.Bertrand, M., Goldin, C., Katz, L.F. (2010). Dynamics of the gender gap for young professionals in the financial and corporate sectors. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 2(3), pp. 228‚Äì255. Another major contribution to the role of gender in the labour market is Bertrand's 2011 chapter in the Handbook of Labor Economics, which reviews the potential of psychological and socio-psychological factors in explaining gender differences in labour market outcomes.Bertrand, M. (2011). New perspectives on gender. In: Card, D., Ashenfelter, O. (eds.). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 1543‚Äì1590. More recently, in research with Emir Kamenica and Jessica Pan, Bertrand has found that the distribution of wives' share of household income drops sharply just after 50%, which she attributes to gender norms averse to the husband earning less than his wife, a norm that in turn affects the formation of marriages, wives' labour force participation and their income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, divorce rates, and the division of household chores.Bertrand, M., Kamenica, E., Pan, J. (2015). Gender identity and relative income within households. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 130(2), pp. 571‚Äì614. Relatedly, Bertrand and Pan have also explored the gender gap in disruptive behaviour, finding that boys' propensity to disruptive behaviour ‚Äì unlike girls' ‚Äì seems to be extremely responsive to parental inputs, which are substantially worse in broken families, whereas early school environment has little impact.Bertrand, M., Pan, J. (2013). The trouble with boys: Social influences and the gender gap in disruptive behavior. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 5(1), pp. 32‚Äì64. Another interesting research pertaining to gender gap is about effect of board quotas on female labor force in Norway. She found that after Norway passed the law to have at least 40% women representation in board meetings, there were no significant impact to the larger population of women in the country. They found that this bill benefited young business graduates who were women the most. The overall conclusion after seven years was that this law had minimum impact on the larger society of the women, expect for the ones who were actually in the board. = Research on corporate governance, family firms and finance= Another major area of Bertrand's research is corporate governance. Together with Mullainathan, Bertrand has researched the determinants of CEO pay, contrasting the contracting view ‚Äì shareholders set CEO contracts in such a way as to limit moral hazard ‚Äì with the skimming view ‚Äì CEOs set their own pay by manipulation the compensation committee to skim as much as possible.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2000). Agents with and without principals. American Economic Review, 90(2), pp. 203‚Äì208. In line with the skimming view, they find that CEO pay responds just as much to luck ‚Äì shocks to the firm performance that are objectively beyond their control ‚Äì as to developments over which they have control, with the sensitivity to luck being generally higher in firms with poor corporate governance.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2001). Are CEOs rewarded for luck? The ones without principals are. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 116(3), pp. 901‚Äì932. Moreover, Bertrand and Mullainathan find that the more managers' firms are sheltered from competition, e.g. antitakeover laws, the more wages rise and productivity and profitability fall, possibly due to decreases in the destruction of old and the creation of new plants, suggesting that managers may prefer stability to empire building.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2003). Enjoying the quiet life? Corporate governance and managerial preferences. Journal of Political Economy, 111(5), pp. 1043‚Äì1075. Together with Antoinette Schoar, Bertrand has investigated the effect of managers on firm policies in the U.S., finding that a large share of differences between firms' investment, financial, and organizational practices are due to differences in their managers and, more importantly, their management style, with older managers generally being more conservative and managers with MBA degrees being generally more aggressive in terms of corporate decisions.Bertrand, M., Schoar, A. (2003). Managing with style: The effect of managers on firm policies. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 118(4), pp. 1169‚Äì1208. In work with Schoar and David Thesmar, Bertrand observes that after the deregulation of banking in France in 1985, banks became less willing to bail out firms with poor performance and firms being more dependent on banks became more likely to restructure, with rising rates of job and asset reallocation, higher allocative efficiency, and a less concentrated banking sector, an observation in line with Schumpeterian processes of creative destruction.Bertrand, M., Schoar, A., Thesmar, D. (2007). Banking deregulation and industry structure: Evidence from the French banking reforms of 1985. Journal of Finance, 62(2), pp. 597‚Äì628. Finally, together with Adair Morse, Bertrand succeeds in decreasing the take-up of highly costly payday loans by 11% over a four-month period by making borrowers think about the dollar fees accruing due to the loans' roll-over, suggesting a role for information disclosure policies to remedy payday borrowing.Bertrand, M., Morse, A. (2011). Information disclosure, cognitive biases, and payday borrowing. Journal of Finance, 66(6), pp. 1865‚Äì1893. Bertrand and Schoar have also conducted research on the role of family for family enterprises, finding that family values tend to be associated with lower economic development ‚Äì though differently than trust ‚Äì and more family firms, are fairly stable over time, don't react much to economic changes, and don't appear to reflect weak formal institutions.Bertrand, M., Schoar, A. (2006). The role of family in family firms. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 20(2), pp. 73‚Äì96. In further research on this topic in Thailand with Simon Johnson and Krislert Samphantharak, Bertrand and Schoar find family involvement in the ownership of family businesses to increase in family size, though firm performance decreases the more the founders' sons become involved, possibly because of a \\"race to the bottom\\" wherein, fearing the dilution of ownership and control over the business group, the descendants attempt to tunnel resources out of the group's firms.Bertrand, M. et al. (2008). Mixing family with business: A study of Thai business groups and the families behind them. Journal of Financial Economics, 88(3), pp. 466‚Äì498. These results are matched by Bertrand and Mullainathan's earlier research on business groups in India, which also finds significant amounts of tunneling, especially via nonoperating components of profit.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2002). Ferreting out tunneling: An application to Indian business groups. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 117(1), pp. 121‚Äì148. = Research on development economics= A third area of Bertrand's research concerns development economics. One of Bertrand's most important contributions to this area is the development (together with Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir) of a view on poverty that emphasizes neither the role of a culture of poverty or of significant differences between the psychology and attitudes of poor and rich people, but rather highlights that the economic consequences of common biases are disproportionately large for poor people precisely because they are poor and thus have little margin for errors.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Shafir, E. (2004). A behavioral- economics view of poverty. American Economic Review, 94(2), pp. 419‚Äì423. They thus argue for the use of insights from behavioural economics and marketing to help poor people make decisions, e.g. by making participation in programs aimed at the poor simple and by investing into the marketing of these programs to increase their outreach.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Shafir, E. (2006). Behavioral economics and marketing in aid of decision making among the poor. Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 25(1), pp. 8‚Äì23. With Mullainathan and Douglas Miller, Bertrand has also studied the allocation of resources within extended families in the wake of South Africa's pension program, finding the labour supply of prime-age individuals to drop sharply when elderly household members become eligible for pensions, with the drop being larger if the pensioner is a woman, if the non-pensioners are themselves old, and if they are male, the drop being largest for the oldest son than for any other prime- age household member.Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S., Miller, D. (2003). Public policy and extended families: Evidence from pensions in South Africa. World Bank Economic Review, 17(1), pp. 27‚Äì50. In India, Bertrand, Mullainathan, Simeon Djankov and Rema Hanna study corruption using the allocation of driver's licenses and find that the illegal obtention of licenses is mostly performed by using private intermediaries to give bribes so that they may not have to pass the driving test.Bertrand, M. et al. (2007). Obtaining a driver's license in India: an experimental approach to studying corruption. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122(4), pp. 1639‚Äì1676. Finally, more recently, Bertrand has been involved in the evaluation of conditional cash transfer programs, e.g. finding that the postponement of transfers to parents until re-enrollment and the incentivization of graduation and tertiary enrollment both increase enrollment rates at the secondary and tertiary level.Barrera-Osorio, F. et al. (2011). Improving the design of conditional transfer programs: Evidence from a randomized education experiment in Colombia. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 3(2), pp. 167‚Äì195.Another interesting research she did in the field of development economics was the marketing in aid of decision making to the poor.In this paper she studies the aspects of economic decision making on the life of the poor, and how it is influenced by effective marketing. = Other research= Other topics of Bertrand's research include econometric methodology, welfare cultures, advertising, lobbyism, and trickle-down consumption: * Because of the correlation between measurement errors of subjective data and many personal characteristics and behaviours, subjective data don't make good dependent variables, though they can be useful as explanatory variables (with Mullainathan).Bertrand, M., Mullainathan, S. (2001). Do people mean what they say? Implications for subjective survey data. American Economic Review, 91(2), pp. 67‚Äì72. * The standard errors of research applying difference in differences estimation to time-series or panel data with serially correlated outcomes are likely to understate the real standard errors if such autocorrelation isn't accounted for (with Mullainathan and Esther Duflo).Bertrand, M., Duflo, E., Mullainathan, S. (2004). How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 119(1), pp. 249‚Äì275. * Being surrounded by others who speak the same language increases welfare participation more for those from high welfare-using language groups (with Erzo Luttmer and Mullainathan).Bertrand, M., Luttmer, E.F.P., Mullainathan, S. (2000). Network effects and welfare cultures. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 115(3), pp. 1019‚Äì1055. * Advertising through the inclusion of a photo of an attractive woman increases demand for consumer loans, decreasing the number of example loans, or not suggesting particular uses for a loan increases loan demand by as much as a 25% reduction in the credit rate, as do longer deadlines for loan applications (with Mullainathan, Shafir, Dean Karlan and Jonathan Zinman).Bertrand, M. et al.

(1999) Retrieved 2014-03-29 Historical Timeline, History of Legal and Illegal Immigration to the United States, 1607-1799 used for an act of the British Parliament (13 Geo. 2 c.7) that was officially titled An Act for Naturalizing such foreign Protestants and others therein mentioned, as are settled or shall settle in any of His Majesty's Colonies in America. The Act became effective on 1 June 1740 and allowed any Protestant alien residing in any of their American colonies for seven years, without being absent from that colony for more than two months, to be deemed \\"his Majesty‚Äôs natural-born subjects of this Kingdom.\\" The Act also required making specific declarations concerning royal allegiance and succession, profession of the Christian faith, and the payment of two shillings. Compared to other alternatives available at the time, the Act provided a cheap and easy method of imperial naturalization, and the length of residency was not unreasonable.Clive Parry, British Nationality Law and the History of Naturalisation, Milano, Giuffr√® (1954) Background Reflecting the situation in Britain,See: English Civil War, Glorious Revolution, Restoration (England) and Nonconformists the necessary profession of Christian faith was distinctly Protestant and specifically Anglican. The act was not intended for conscientious Roman Catholics, and they were referred to in the law as Papists. Exceptions however for non-conforming religious scruples and conscience were made, in the case of Quakers and Jews. Adherents of both faiths were allowed to dispense with the Sacramental test, with the former being allowed to affirm the oaths, and the latter being relieved of the obligation to repeat the words 'Upon the true faith of a Christian', at the end of the Oath of Abjuration required by the Act of Settlement since 1701.Also see, Oath of Abjuration, Oath of Allegiance Contents The Plantation Act was enacted to systematize naturalization procedures in all localities as well as to encourage immigration to the American colonies. It provided a workable naturalization procedure by empowering colonial courts to administer the oath of allegiance to aliens. The act endowed colonial courts with the responsibility of deciding when alien petitioners had fulfilled the statutory requirements for imperial citizenship. The Secretaries of Colonies were required, under penalty, to send annual lists of such persons to the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations. In proprietary colonies, the judges were appointed by colonial governors and thus represented the royal or proprietary interest. However, by delegating authority to colonial officials, naturalization became subject to the pressure of the same local interest groups that increasingly defied the governor's efforts to implement royal and proprietary instructions on other issues.Marilyn C. Baseler, \\"Asylum for Mankind\\": America, 1607-1800, p.63-69, 124-127. Cornell University Press (1998). Despite the penalties imposed under the act, only six Secretaries of the thirteen American Colonies and one in the West Indies submitted the mandated lists. Development In England during the 17th and 18th centuries, several basic statutes applied to naturalization,Hoyt, Naturalization p. 257-258 ff \\"The following are the basic statutes on naturalization which applied in England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: 7 Jas. I, c. 2, [1609, Naturalization and restoration of blood]; 15 Carl. II, c. 15, Linen Cloth Act 1663; 6 Anne, c. 37, Duties on East India Goods Act 1707; 7 Anne, c. 5, Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708; 13 Geo. II, c. 3, Supply of Seamen Act 1739; 22 Geo. II, c. 45, Whale Fishery Act 1748; 26 Geo. II, c. 26, Jewish Naturalization Act 1753.\\" but these statutes would not include many aliens in the colonies who were considered an integral part of the colonial communities. Over the same time period, the American provinces (except New Hampshire) passed their own naturalization laws, which granted citizenship to people living within their province. These laws were based more on local colonial interpretations of community citizenship than on stricter considerations in the mother-country. but they gave no rights beyond their borders. This situation was initially accepted as positive and workable in England, but proved to be too inconsistent with and broader imperial intentions as time passed. Britain began withdrawing support to promote immigration to the colonies at the end of the Seven Years' War. Colonial implementation both before and after the Plantation Act tended to ignore, evade, and reshape English regulations, thus vitiating many policy decisions and generating a chaotic array of citizenship procedures. The Navigation Acts were a particular target for evasion, since they were seen as acting more as restraint on both colonial naturalization and its peoples' ability to take part fully in the economy. Colonial naturalization of aliens was outright forbidden in December 1773, under any conditions.Baeler, Asylum, p. 125 \\"Each royal governor was instructed \\"that you do not upon any pretense whatsoever give your assent to any Bill or Bills that may have been or shall hereafter be passed by the Council and Assembly of the Province under your Government for the naturalization of Aliens...nor for establishing a Title in any Person to Lands, Tennements & real estates in your said Province originally granted to, or purchased by Aliens antecedent to Naturalization.\\" A ban on royal land grants, initiated earlier in 1773, was made final in February 1774. The colonial naturalization laws and the Plantation Act, during its nearly 30-year utilization would define British North America as a refuge and land of opportunity, The prohibition on naturalizing foreigners under the act was considered intolerable, and would be included, inter alia, in the grievances listed in the Declaration of Independence, though some consider that surprising. Despite being a British law, the Plantation Act \\"was the model upon which the Naturalization Act of 1790, the first U.S. naturalization act, with respect to time, oath of allegiance, process of swearing before a judge, and the like, was clearly based.\\" Notes Great Britain Acts of Parliament 1740 History of immigration to the United States Jewish-American history Jewish English history Jewish emancipation ","title":"Plantation Act 1740"},{"id":"42562076","text":"Aurantimonas litoralis is a Gram-negative, catalase- and oxidase-positive, non-motile bacteria from the genus of Aurantimonas which was isolated from coastal water from Oregon in the United States.

He works for Nine Newspapers, based in Melbourne's The Age newspaper and also appearing in theThe Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian Financial Review. He was also a reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's television program, Four Corners and is also a reporter for Nine's tabloid current affairs programme 60 Minutes. Life and career His career began as a cadet journalist at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, later joining Fairfax Media (now Nine Newspapers). McKenzie's reporting has led to a number of government inquiries and police investigations, including a federal police probe into political donations given by alleged mafia figures. McKenzie‚Äôs reporting on corruption and organised crime within the Australian Customs service in 2012 was recognised with a Walkley Award. The reporting led to reforms of the Australian customs service announced in 2013 by Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare and overseen by former NSW judge James Wood. A news story by McKenzie on Four Corners in 2014 into abuse in disability care homes led to a Victorian Ombudsman inquiry and a federal senate inquiry, which recommended a royal commission that was later announced by the Morrison Government. In 2012, McKenzie obtained confidential Victoria Police files documenting the suicides of at least 40 people sexually abused by Catholic clergy in Victoria. Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu immediately called a parliamentary inquiry into abuse allegations by religious clergy. McKenzie has been involved in many high profile stories. He interviewed Australian terrorist leader Abdul Nacer Benbrika months before Benbrika was arrested and jailed for leading terror cells in Sydney and Melbourne. During Benbrika‚Äôs court case, the public prosecutor told the court that Benbrika was covertly recorded by authorities claiming that he had threatened McKenzie, telling him to ‚Äúwatch yourself‚Äù and that he knew how to find the reporter. An interview McKenzie conducted with sports scientist Steven Dank was used by Australia‚Äôs anti-doping agency ASADA in its controversial doping case against the Essendon Football Club. An report in 2009 by McKenzie and his Nine Newspapers colleague Richard Baker into alleged foreign bribery involving two companies owned by the Reserve Bank of Australia, sparked a national scandal and prompted an investigation by the Australian Federal Police. It ultimately led to Australia's first-ever foreign bribery prosecution in 2011, with the criminal charging of two firms, Securency and Note Printing Australia and several individuals. McKenzie and Baker were awarded a Walkley Award for Investigative Reporting for their investigation, which also led to the governor of the Reserve Bank, Glenn Stevens, testifying before a Senate committee to respond to allegations the bank mishandled the scandal. In 2014, a report co-authored by McKenzie on an undisclosed multi-million dollar payment to Hong Kong chief executive CY Leung from Australian company UGL, prompted widespread calls for Leung's resignation and sparked an investigation by Hong Kong authorities. Much of McKenzie's work has been produced with Richard Baker. In 2016, the pair revealed the Unaoil oil industry corruption scandal that implicated some of the world's biggest oil industry firms, including Rolls Royce, ABB, Petrofac and Halliburton in alleged corruption involving a Monaco firm called Unaoil. In 2019, the founders of Unaoil pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption offences in the United States.  Documentaries  McKenzie has been awarded the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year Award (with Richard Baker) and the Lowy Institute Media Award for his documentary reporting on foreign interference in Australia by the Chinese Communist Party. His 2017 Four Corners documentary program Power and Influence reported that ASIO had warned Australian political parties about receiving donations from two men, billionaires Huang Xiangmo and Chau Chak Wing. It also reported that former Trade Minister Andrew Robb had been hired on a $880,000 yearly consultancy by a company closely linked to the Chinese government. The story sparked intense national political debate and was a catalyst for new counter foreign interference laws. Donor Huang Xiangmo was in 2018 expelled from Australia by ASIO on security grounds but maintains the allegations made about him are false. In 2018, Chau Chak Wing commenced defamation proceedings in June 2018 against McKenzie, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Fairfax Media over the joint investigation. In July 2019, McKenzie presented a report on Nine Network's TV program 60 Minutes titled Crown Unmasked which made allegations that Crown Resorts had violated Chinese law by promoting its casinos to mainland gamblers. The investigation, which was assisted by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald newspapers (which became sister businesses of Nine Network after Nine Entertainment Co. acquired Fairfax Media in 2018) and featured comments from former Crown employees, also questioned Crown‚Äôs relationships with certain junket operators ‚Äî the middlemen who help recruit VIP gamblers and act as credit agents to get around China‚Äôs capital controls ‚Äî that have been linked to Hong Kong‚Äôs triads. The investigation also revealed the existence of an arrangement with Australia‚Äôs Department of Home Affairs to speed up processing of short-stay visa applications by Crown‚Äôs VIP gamblers. Crown denied the report's claims, publishing advertisements in local newspapers calling the investigation ‚Äúa deceitful campaign‚Äù that relied on ‚Äúunsubstantiated allegations, exaggerations, unsupported connections and outright falsehoods.‚Äù Federal and state authorities, including the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, have opened probes into the allegations. =The Age/Nine recordings= On 14 June 2020, Mckenzie reporting for The Age and Nine Network released covert recordings purporting to show cabinet minister and Labor party power broker Adem Somyurek organising branch stacking. In its investigation, Somyurek is alleged to have registered local party members with false details, taking funds from business owners to pay for party membership fees, and directing ministerial staffers with branch stacking activities. Included in the numerous covert recordings, are several sections where Somyurek is heard making derogatory comments towards MPs Gabrielle Williams and Marlene Kairouz and ministerial staffers, which have been described as sexist and homophobic. Following the release of recordings, on 15 June 2020, Premier Andrews sacked Somyurek from his cabinet and referred Somyurek's conduct to Victoria Police and the Independent Broad- based Anti-corruption Commission for further investigation. Andrews also wrote to the National Executive of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) to seek the termination of Somyurek's party membership. Later that day, the Labor Party's national president, Wayne Swan, confirmed that Somyurek had resigned his membership, adding that Labor's National Executive Committee had taken further steps to ensure there would \\"never be a place for Somyurek in the ALP ever again\\".  Source protection and defamation cases  In 2015, McKenzie defeated a Victorian Supreme Court application brought by an alleged mafia figure for disclosure of his sources in the first legal test of Victoria‚Äôs journalist shield laws. The case was described by the ABC's Media Watch program as a landmark test of source protection. In the case, the defence successfully argued that to identify McKenzie‚Äôs source for a story about the plaintiff‚Äôs alleged mafia link would jeopardise that person‚Äôs physical safety. The court also accepted arguments about the strong public interest in publishing such a story, and the chilling effect on such stories if the order were granted. The Australian journalists‚Äô union, the MEAA, described the decision as ‚Äúimportant for public interest journalism because it acknowledges that journalists must protect the identity of sources who have asked to have their identity protected.‚Äù However, other reporting of the case outcome said from an investigative journalist‚Äôs perspective, it left shield laws in a state that was still far from satisfactory. In his ruling, Supreme Court Justice John Dixon found that it was reasonable for police to suspect the alleged mafia figure had put out a $200,000 ‚Äúhit‚Äù on a man suspected of providing information to McKenzie. In 2016, the alleged mafia boss abandoned his defamation legal action against The Age over a series of articles describing him as a mafia boss involved in murder, extortion and drug trafficking. The Age published an apology to the man that acknowledges that he was never charged by the police with any criminal offence. The apology did not retract that he is the head of the Calabrian mafia and involved in organised crime In an earlier case in 2013, Chinese investor Helen Liu commenced defamation proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against The Age and three of its journalists including McKenzie in relation a series of stories about the Chinese-Australian businesswoman and a Labor MP. Each journalist made an application to keep their sources confidential, however were unable to rely on shield laws as they hadn‚Äôt been introduced. Justice Lucy McCallum rejected the application, finding that a journalist's pledge to keep a source confidential \\"is not a right or an end in itself\\" and could be overridden \\"in the interests of justice\\". The case was settled out of court and no sources were disclosed. In 2017, the ABC reached a confidential settlement with the Canberra University president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association after she appeared in a Four Corners program reported by McKenzie about the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in Australian politics and universities. A report by The Australian newspaper about the settlement states that the president \\"demanded an apology from the media companies, which was refused. Five months later, [the president's lawyers] filed a defamation action in the Victorian Supreme Court, prompting both media outlets to reach an out-of-court settlement within weeks.\\" Later on, in 2018, Four Corners added an editors note to the program transcript with the rider that: ‚ÄúIt was not the intention of the ABC to suggest that [the president]... was a spy or a person who would deliberately cause harm to other students.‚Äù McKenzie and veteran reporter Chris Masters have produced several reports detailing allegations that Australia‚Äôs special forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan. They have reported that Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts- Smith is under investigation by the federal police and the military inspector general. Roberts-Smith has attacked the claims as unfounded and is suing McKenzie and Masters. =Case on database access= In 2010, McKenzie and two colleagues, investigative reporters Ben Schneiders and Royce Millar, wrote a story detailing how political parties were storing personal information about voters, raising privacy concerns. A Greens party candidate in the 2010 state election, Fraser Brindley, had supplied the password to a political party database, which he had obtained unlawfully and the journalists including McKenzie subsequently accessed the ALP Eleczilla database. The Victorian Electoral Commissioner referred the journalists to Victoria Police, who charged McKenzie with unauthorised access to a restricted database. McKenzie and his co-accused admitted responsibility for the offence as part of a court diversion program by acknowledging they accessed the database, thereby avoiding a conviction. The trio‚Äôs barrister told the magistrate the journalists believed there was a public interest in whether political parties should maintain such data and that investigative journalists provide ‚Äúgenuine service to this community.‚Äù The Age also agreed to publish a news article and editorial acknowledging the unlawful conduct. The Age editor-in-chief Andrew Holden defended the paper's decision to publish the database story, stating that investigative journalists needed to pursue stories in the public interest but said the paper was not mindful enough of the legal issues involved. Awards and recognition McKenzie has won Australia's top journalism award, the Walkley Award, on eight occasions. In 2012, McKenzie and Baker were rated the third most influential journalists or editors in Australia by news website Crikey. McKenzie won the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year award with Baker in 2017 for his work on Chinese Communist Party interference in Australia. In 2010, McKenzie and his colleague Richard Baker were awarded the prestigious George Munster Prize for Independent Journalism by the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. McKenzie is the most decorated journalist in the history of the Melbourne Press Club's Quill Awards and has twice won the press club's highest award, the Gold Quill. Books In 2012, McKenzie's book The Sting, about one of Australia's biggest organised crime and money laundering investigations, was published by Melbourne University Publishing (MUP) Victory Books. McKenzie has also contributed to the Australian journalism textbooks, Australian Journalism Today (2012) and The Best Australian Business Writing (2012).

Sikora is credited with being the first Soviet artist to have started performing international jazz, swing and pop standards in their respective original languages. Biography Ruzhena Sikora was born in Novorossiysk. Her father Vladimir Vladimirovich Sikora was a second-generation Russian Czech, son of a wine-maker Vladimir Sikora Sr. who in the mid-19th century left his country for Tiflis, Georgia, then settled in Abrau-Dyurso, Krasnodar Krai. Vladimir Sikora Jr., an accountant in a local cement factory, was a part-time opera singer, well known among the Novorossiysk connoisseurs. Ruzhena's mother, Veronika Adamovna Sikora, came from Poland. Encouraged by her father, Ruzhena began singing as a three-year-old. At the age of five she started studying the piano and four years later was able to accompany her father on a professional level, first at home, then with her own solo program at the local Pioneers' Palace and the City's Theatre. In July 1936, Vladimir Sikora died of heart attack. To help support the family in the times when only state workers received provision cards, Ruzhena went to work at a local cement factory. In the evenings, she was playing the piano at the factory's cinema club and still managed to continue her musical education. Impressed by one of her public performances, the city authorities sent the 18-year-old to the Rostov-on-Don musical college, one of the best in the country, which she graduated in 1941, as a professional vocalist. =Career= As a student, Sikora joined Dmitry Voronin's North Caucasian Railways Orchestra, working part-time. A self-styled proponent of what later became known as the 'Theatre of Song', the girl was spotted in Baku by an established pianist, composer and conductor Alexander Tsfasman who invited her to join his own musical collective. In May 1941 she debuted as a singer of the Tsfasman-led Soviet Radio Jazz Orchestra at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition's Green Theatre in Moscow. The young singer was looking forward to a nationwide tour after which she planned to join the Moscow Gnessin State Musical College, but then the War came. Ruzhena Sikora continued to perform in besieged Moscow, while working with the volunteer patrol groups. She joined a small artistic frontline brigade (alongside stage entertainer Mikhail Garkavi, and dancers Anna Redel and Mikhail Khrustalyov) and embarked upon the continuous 'trenches tour'. \\"Strangely, in the frontline forests and trenches we felt safer than in Moscow. Our audience were enthusiastic, lively people getting themselves ready for next day's fight... Things were more depressing in hospitals. But we knew our concerts meant a lot for the injured boys and were doing our best,\\" she remembered. Decades later, in 2005 she was awarded the Medal \\"For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941‚Äì1945\\". In 1946 Sikora re-joined the Tsfasman's Orchestra. She took part in the 2nd All-Union Competition of Soviet Popular Music Performers (the first one in 1940 brought Klavdya Shulzhenko into the spotlight) and won the 1st prize. The same year Sikora debuted as a recording artist when \\"The Crescent in the Blue Sky\\" was released on record. Other popular songs of her extensive late-1940s repertoire included \\"A Friend\\", \\"Remembering\\", \\"Wait For You\\", \\"The Light of Stars\\", \\"Lights\\", \\"I Won't Be Writing To You\\", \\"Little Rain\\". In 1947 the Radio Jazz Orchestra disbanded and, as Tsfasman became the director of the Moscow Hermitage Theatre, Sikora joined its Sympho-Jazz band. Established composers like Nikita Bogoslovsky, Matvey Blanter, Mark Fradkin, Vano Muradeli and Kirill Molchanov were now writing the originals for her. Critics praised her restrained elegance, the ability to achieve dramatic effect by simple, almost ascetic means. The first Soviet singer to start performing foreign originals in different languages (Czech, Polish, Italian, French, Spanish), she received serious chastising in the Soviet press in 1955, blamed (by Sovyetskaya Kultura newspaper) for, among other things, condoning the 'hostile ideology' by performing songs of 'dubious origins'. Several years earlier such verdict could mean serious trouble, but the mid-1950s anti-'West-worshippers' campaign was the last of its kind. Sikora's success continued, she visited Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany with solo concerts. In the early 1950s Sikora married pianist Viktor Goryshnik who became her accompanist on stage. In the early 1960s the pair suffered a serious car accident. Goryshnik died, Ruzhena Sikora spent seven months in hospital. Later the singer returned on stage, then married band leader Nikolai Taranenko. But giving full-time concerts for her was becoming more and more difficult and in the 1970s she had to quit, continuing to teach vocals, at the Central House of Artists in Moscow. After the retirement, Sikora appeared on stage twice, first at the Alexander Vertinsky memorial, alongside Nikita Bogoslovsky and Bulat Okudzhava. Then in February 1993 music historian and writer Valery Safoshkin organized the Ruzhena Sikora special concert at the Moscow Central House of Artists. In the finale of this highly successful show the legendary performer Izabella Yuryeva rose on stage to present the bouquet of flowers to Ruzhena Sikora. Also in 1993 she was granted the prestigious title of the People's Artist of Russia. Ruzhena Vladimirovna Sikora died on 23 December 2006 in Moscow. She was buried at the Khimkinskoye Cemetery.

Following the opening of the deep water port in Fremantle in 1897 many shipping and transport companies acquired land in the area and commenced building offices and warehouses. The Australian Union Steamship Navigation Company acquired land along Phillimore Street and constructed the existing building there in 1903. The principal architect of the building was Charles Lancelot Oldham, who designed the two- storey, brick and stone structure in the Federation Free Classical style with an imposing facade and arches around a large centrally located pediment. The ground level has a recessed colonnade entrance porch while the upper storey has a recessed colonnade arcade with balustrading. There are horizontal shadow lines on the ground floor and with a balustrade parapet and a triangular stuccoed central pediment. The initials AUSNC, for the initial owner, can be seen on the pediment. The steamship company was taken over by P&O; in 1914 after the state Government took away the company's monopoly by forming the State Shipping Service. The building was listed with the National Trust in 1974. In 1996 the Danish Consul and the shipping company Maersk had offices on the upper floor while the University of Notre Dame business school occupied the ground floor. The building is currently occupied by the School of Nursing and Midwifery of Notre Dame University. The University spent 2.78 million on refurbishing both the P&O; and the neighbouring Howard Smith Building prior to moving in.

Prior to building the Crown Hotel, Crocker already owned The Volunteer pub in Kilburn, London. Crocker's Folly Crocker's Folly is a Grade II* listed public house at 23-24 Aberdeen Place, St John's Wood, London. It was built in 1898, in a Northern Renaissance style, and was previously called The Crown. Brandwood and Jephcote describe it as \\"a truly magnificent pub-cum-hotel\\" with \\"superb fittings\\", including extensive use of marble. The architect was Charles Worley. In 1987, the pub's name was changed to Crocker's Folly. The story was that Frank Crocker built the pub to serve the new terminus of the Great Central Railway, but when the terminus was actually built it was over half a mile away at Marylebone Station, leading to Crocker's ruin, despair and eventual suicide. In reality, Crocker did die in 1904, aged only 41, but of natural causes. It has been claimed that Crocker's ghost haunts the pub.

Hartley was hanged, twice, after a trial at Lancaster Assizes in March 1597. Background At the end of the 16th century in Elizabethan England superstition and belief in witchcraft were rife, there were religious tensions between the supporters of the new faith, the Church of England, Puritans and adherents of Roman Catholicism. Lancashire was a sparsely populated county at the time of the Reformation and remained a stronghold of Catholicism throughout the Elizabethan reign. The county was reputed to contain more witches and believers in witchcraft than any other. Cunning folk were regarded as being distinct from witches and were called on to perform acts of healing. History Anne Parr, who had inherited Cleworth Hall, married Nicholas Starkie of Huntroyde depriving her Roman Catholic relations of what they considered their inheritance. Some were said to have prayed for the death of her four children that died in infancy. Their surviving children, Ann aged about ten, and John, two years older began having fits. Their father spent ¬£200 on doctors with no success and became convinced they were \\"possessed by the Devil\\". He asked a Catholic priest to exorcise the evil spirits but the priest declined. Starkie in desperation approached Edmund Hartley, a magician and travelling \\"conjurer\\", who was in the neighbourhood for help. Using charms and herbal potions, Hartley was able to calm the children but not cure them completely. Starkey paid 40 shillings per year for Hartley's services but Hartley demanded more. Starkie's refusal to give Hartley a house and land resulted in threats and in the afternoon three other children in the house, Margaret and Ellinor Hurdman and Ellen Holland, a maid, Jane Ashton and a relative, Margaret Byrom, were also affected. Starkie suspected that Hartley was by then part of the problem and consulted John Dee, warden of the Collegiate Church in Manchester. Dee was reluctant to become involved, but rebuked Hartley and advised Starkie to consult \\"some godly preachers\\". For a short while all was quiet at Cleworth Hall but the children's fits and bouts of shouting returned. The maid, Jane Ashton and Margaret Byrom were affected after being kissed by Hartley who \\"breathed the Devil\\" into them. Hartley followed Margaret Byrom to her home in Salford where he was found by preachers, and unable to recite the Lord's Prayer was accused of witchcraft. The story of the demonic possessions at Cleworth Hall was documented by George More, who with John Darrell and several others including a local curate, arrived at Cleworth after Hartley's execution in March 1597 to dispossess the seven of their demons. In turn Darrell and More were imprisoned for their involvement in the dispossessions. Witch trial Hartley was arrested and sent for trial to Lancaster. At his trial in March 1597, Starkie said that the previous autumn while in the woods at Huntroyde, Hartley had drawn a circle \\" with many crosses and partitions\\". Starkie's evidence led to the death penalty. Hartley's execution was botched, at the first attempt to hang him the rope broke but even though Hartley repented he was hanged at the second attempt.

The film premi√®red on 18 April 2014 at Silverbird Galleria, Victoria Island, Lagos. It tells a story of the marital relationship between Debbie (Adesua Etomi) and Moses (Blossom Chukwujekwu), and how an untold story from Moses' past tries to jeopardize their seemingly flawless union. The story takes an intriguing turn when a music producer Thomas Dacosta (Majid Michel) enters into their lives. Plot Debby (Adesua Etomi) and Moses (Blossom Chukwujekwu) are a married couple; both are vibrant gospel singers, but Moses constantly hit Debby, such that he has made her suffer a miscarriage four consecutive times already. It gets worse as Debby becomes the much more successful gospel artiste in the music industry. Debby refuses to let anyone know about the violent marriage, not wanting her husband to be judged, and trying everything possible to improve on herself, waiting on God's miracle She meets Thomas (Majid Michel), a secular music producer, an ardent smoker, who claims he is an addict. Thomas wants Debby to be signed in his label, an offer she vehemently refuses, but Thomas won't back off. Moses starts noticing Debby and Thomas together and he starts to get jealous, sighting Debby's new fire when they make love, even though Debby has assured that there's nothing to be worried about; Moses becomes more violent regardless. Debby leaves home to Wunmi's (Leelee Byoma) place; Debby's closest friend, the family's doctor, and a church member who has become aware of what's going on. Debby eventually returns to Moses, after his endless apologies. On their way back from a media interview, Moses accuses Debby of patronizing him during the interview; when Debby apologizes to avoid a fight, he accuses her of pitying him. After a heated argument, he drops Debby in the middle of the road. Thomas sees Debby walking and he teases her until she agrees to accept a ride to his home. In his home, Thomas convinces Debby to change from gospel to inspirational music and join his label. After the formal discussions, Thomas shows Debby around his house and they both get cozy with each other. Thomas brings up the issue of her violent husband revealing that he knows. He asks her why she's still with him, and she explains that she's worried about what the church and the society would think, as she's a role model to millions around the world. Thomas advises her to think about herself, do what she thinks is right and move on; he warns her that Moses might end up killing her. When they're about to leave to sign the record deal, Thomas kisses her; she feels disgusted and slaps him, Thomas apologizes. Debby signs the record deal, with an appointment for 8am the next morning. Thomas takes her home very late in the night, telling her to forget the kiss ever happened. Debby enters the house to pack her belongings, but Moses again pleads for a last chance. She forgives him and tells him about the record deal and her appointment for next morning. Debby wakes up at 7:15am, only to find all her clothes socked in water in the bathtub, and Moses nowhere to be found. She puts on Moses shirt and trousers, so she can meetup with the appointment.

Affaltrach is a village in South West Germany, incorporated to the Obersulm municipality, which is located about 50 km north east of Stuttgart. The village Jewish synagogue and cemetery are the last remnants of the now abandoned Affaltrach Jewish community. Affaltrach in December 2010 History =Before the 19th century= Jews began to settle in Affaltrach in 1660, under the protection of the ruling Knights Hospitaller order. In 1683, three or four Jewish families were living in Affaltrach. By 1749, the Jewish community of Affaltrach reached to about 17 families, dealing mainly with trading cattle, money and goods. A Jewish cemetery was established in 1706 and can still be visited today. =19th century= Affaltrach synagoge in 2006 During the 19th century, the Jewish community of Affaltrach was bigger than at any other time: In 1807 - 110 Jews (about 11% of total population), 1843 - 164, 1858 - 219. Due to emigration to bigger cities and other reasons, during the second half of the 19th century the community started to minimize to 151 in 1869, 79 in 1886 and 28 in 1910 (3.75% of the total population). In 1861, a district report \\"Beschreibung des Oberamts Weinsberg\\", was written in Stuttgart by F.L.I Dillenius, depicting the geographical, demographic and economical conditions of the weinsberg district (‚ÄûOberamt Weinsberg‚Äú), an administrative area operated between 1755 and 1926, that Affaltrach was part of. The report stated that Affaltrach had 990 inhabitants in 1861, among them 219 Jews. It is also stated that in 1856, 41 children learned in the Jewish school. In addition, trade was mostly mediated by Jews. =20th century= After the beginning of the industrialisation and with the 19th century liberal Jew legislation, Jews from rural areas settled to the bigger cities. That's why the Jewish population of Affaltrach was decreasing, so there were only about 21 people left in 1921. During World War I, three Jews from Affaltrach who were drafted to the German military died in service, and were buried at the local Jewish cemetery. The names of the Jewish soldiers were erased from the town's war memorial during the Nazi Period. A memorial in their honor was also erected in the Jewish cemetery, which is still there today. In the wake of World War II, the town Jews were denied access to their shops, and they were eventually deported out of town between 1941 and 1943. The town economy was largely depended on Jewish businesses. Two of the three local grocery stores were owned by Jews, in addition to two butchers, a baker and a clothier.

Between 1820 and 1824 the synagogue was expanded and a women gallery was added to it, in the cost of about 700 florins. In 1851, a newer synagogue replaced the old one. In addition to the synagogue itself, the building hosted also a teaching room, a teacher's apartment and a Mikveh. During 1938 Kristallnacht the synagogue was devastated and used as a storeroom and refugee shelter. Nowadays, the synagogue is used as a museum for the Jewish community of Affaltrach and maintained by an association specifically dealing with the building. The museum collection shows a few ritual objects, posters and pictures depicting the history of Jews in the Heilbronn area. =Jewish cemetery= Jewish cemetery Affaltrach The Affaltrach Jewish cemetery is located to the north of the village itself. The oldest gravestone seen today is dated to 1677. The cemetery served not only Affaltrach but also the nearby villages of Sontheim, Talheim and Horkheim. The cemetery hall and the memorial for the fallen Jewish soldiers who served in the German army during World War I still exist in the cemetery ground. Estimations suggest that the cemetery has around 700 graves, the last one dated to August 1942. World War I memorial at Jewish cemetery Affaltrach Nowadays, the key to the synagogue is kept at the Protestant Rectory in Affaltrach. Documentation, pictures and details of all gravestones can be reached through the burial book of the Affaltrach cemetery. Notable residents Bertha Thalheimer Two of the most notable residents of Affaltrach were August Thalheimer and his sister Bertha, both were born in Affaltrach and had family there. August and Bertha were Communist activists during the first half of the 20th century. Bertha and August were first members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and then were among the founders of the Spartacus League. Later on, while August became the main theorist of the Spartacus League and published several essays on Communism, he exiled to France and eventually to Cuba, where he died in 1948. Bertha stayed in Germany and served two years in prison since October 1917 due to her part in Anti-war demonstrations. During World War II she was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943 until she was released in 1945. She died in Stuttgart in 1959. Reports During the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, some reports about the Jewish community of Affaltrach were published and still exist today. =Anti-Semitic incident in 1899= In February 1899, an article describing an anti-Semitic incident in Affaltrach was published in Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums. Apparently, a few young men attacked a few Jewish shop owners in Affaltrach, causing them slight injuries and insulting Judaism. They were given trials and were sentenced to about 14 days of prison and a fine, though some irregularities were found in the process of the trial, according to the article itself. =Newspaper articles= Some Jewish newspapers dating to the first decades of the 20th centuries depict ordinary life and occasions among the Affaltrach Jewish community.

To be effective it must be used within a short time of the poisoning occurring, typically an hour. It does not work for poisonings by cyanide, corrosive agents, iron, lithium, alcohols, or malathion. It may be taken by mouth or given by a nasogastric tube. Other uses include inside hemoperfusion machines. Common side effects include vomiting, black stools, diarrhea, and constipation. The more serious side effect, pneumonitis, may result if aspirated into the lungs. Gastrointestinal obstruction and ileus are less common but serious adverse effects. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Activated charcoal works by adsorbing the toxin. While charcoal has been used since ancient times for poisonings, activated charcoal has been used since the 1900s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses =Poison ingestion= Activated charcoal is used to treat many types of oral poisonings such as phenobarbital and carbamazepine. It is not effective for a number of poisonings including: strong acids or bases, iron, lithium, arsenic, methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol. No randomized controlled trials have shown activated charcoal improves outcomes and routine use is not recommended. In a study of acute poisonings from agricultural pesticides and yellow oleander seeds, the administration of activated carbon did not affect survival rates. =Gastrointestinal tract-related issues= Charcoal biscuits were sold in England starting in the early 19th century, originally as remedy to flatulence and stomach trouble. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and flatulence. There is some evidence of its effectiveness to prevent diarrhea in cancer patients who have received irinotecan. It can interfere with the absorption of some medications, and lead to unreliable readings in medical tests such as the guaiac card test. Activated carbon is also used for bowel preparation by reducing intestinal gas content before abdominal radiography to visualize bile and pancreatic and renal stones. A type of charcoal biscuit has also been marketed as a pet care product. =Other= Claims that activated charcoal will do things such as whiten teeth, cure alcohol-induced hangovers, and prevent bloating, are not supported by evidence. Activated charcoal cleanses also lack evidence and are considered pseudoscience. Side effects Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated. The use of activated carbon is contraindicated when the ingested substance is an acid, an alkali, or a petroleum product. Mechanism of action In cases of suspected poisoning, medical personnel administer activated carbon on the scene or at a hospital's emergency department. In rare situations, it may also be used in a hemoperfusion system to remove toxins from the blood stream of poisoned patients. Activated carbon has become the treatment of choice for many poisonings, and other decontamination methods such as ipecac-induced emesis or stomach pumping are now used rarely. *Binding of the poison to prevent stomach and intestinal absorption. Reversible binding using a cathartic, such as sorbitol, may be added. *It interrupts the enterohepatic and enteroenteric circulation of some drugs/toxins and their metabolites.

Lean cuts of beef are one common target of artificial marbling. The process may also be performed on pork. It has been described as a more technologically advanced form of larding. Names and labelling The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore labels artificially marbled beef as \\"beef tallow- injected further processed beef\\". Hokubee Australia markets its fat-injected beef product under the brand name Meltique, though its halal products use canola oil instead of fat, due to concerns about cross-contamination with pork tallow. The United States Department of Agriculture requires that when fats and oils are added to red meat products such as roast beef and steaks, the product indicate this prominently, for example as part of the product name or as a product name qualifier. Additionally, products that appear to be of a higher quality as a result of fat injections must include a statement to indicate this, such as \\"injected with beef fat\\", \\"artificially marbled-- simulated fat covered\\", or \\"product may appear to be of a higher quality than the actual grade‚Äú. Some unscrupulous purveyors have taken advantage of the improved appearance in an attempt to pass it off as the higher-quality naturally marbled meat, especially in environments such as restaurants, where the meat's packaging and labelling are not visible to customers. Manufacturing process A variety of injectants may be used to create artificial marbling. The injectant may be pure fat (such as tallow) heated to a high temperature to melt it while sufficiently cool so as not to cook the meat when injected, fat suspended in an emulsifier, fat blended with vegetable oils, or fatty acids such as conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in powder form. Research into artificial marbling through fat injection was carried out as early as the 1960s. A 1999 Polish study found that fat-injected horse meat tended to retain more flavour than non-injected control samples after two-week and three-month periods of cold storage. Another 2007 U.S. study by Tyson Foods and the University of Arkansas used beef strip loin and injected it with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in powder form, or oil with high concentration of CLAs. Under visual assessment by independent panelists, the USDA marbling score of the powder-treated meat increased by two levels. The powder-treated meat tended to be juicier than the oil-treated meat after cooking, but otherwise the injected meat had similar colour and flavour to the untreated meat. A 2017 study from West Texas A&M; University found that the injection of beef loins with pork back fat resulted in higher consumer preference scores for juiciness and overall preference. Cooked steaks injected with pork fat had a lower moisture content but higher fat content, and trained panelists could detect an \\"off aroma.\\" See also *Forcemeat References External links *, granted 2 November 1965 *, granted 1 October 1991 Meat Food processing ","title":"Artificial marbling"},{"id":"42562546","text":"Prof. John Share Jones , known as Dr Share Jones (25 August 1873 ‚Äì 2 December 1950), was a British veterinary surgeon and briefly a Liberal Party politician.

The factory is still located at 2/b Elephant road, Dhaka, and had an employee count of 300 people, to contrast that with the 30,000+ people being employed by NASSA at the moment. Nazrul Islam Swapan left the company in 2010 over a dispute over ownership with Nazrul Islam Mazumder. Then along the line in 1999, EXIM Bank was incorporated into the NASSA Group. In 2017, after the Government of Bangladesh used intelligence agencies to remove the directors of Islami Bank Bangladesh, seven companies of NASSA received loans from the Bank without adequate collateral.

Controversies =Factory closure= In awake of the Rana plaza collapse, which is considered to be the deadliest garment- factory accident in history, NASSA Group shut down three of its factories. It was insinuated in a couple of articles that this was a reactionary response to the Rana plaza collapse rather than a proactive step to ensure the safety of the workers, but it was established that the company made the decision before the 24 April collapse because of structural concerns about the rental space that housed the three facilities and says it is committed to the safety and security of its employees. Before the closures, which took effect on 28 April, Nassa Group operated 34 factories in Bangladesh. In an earlier version of an article in The Wall Street Journal, stated that due to the structural integrity being compromised, the government took action to close the factories down, which turned out to be wrong information. The chairman of NASSA Group, Nazrul Islam Mazumder appointed Mishcon de Reya to challenge Wall Street Journal, as NASSA Group had already decided to close the factories on their own accord before 24 April collapse, after which WSJ were compelled to change the article to reflect the facts.

Early life Marko Milo≈°eviƒá was born in 1974 in Belgrade. At the time, his mother, Mirjana Markoviƒá, was a professor of sociology at the University of Belgrade and his father Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was beginning to develop status in national politics.Doder, Dusko & Louise Branson. Milosevic: Portrait of a Tyrant. The Free Press: New York. 1999. p.25. Marko was named after a legendary family ancestor of the Milo≈°eviƒá family, a Serbian chieftain who fought against Turks in the 18th century and is recorded in Serbian folk poems. Milo≈°eviƒá's early years have been described as host to numerous high-level political visits, with the young Milo≈°eviƒá apparently holding a familial, paternal relationship with Serbian President Ivan Stamboliƒá. Milo≈°eviƒá was raised atheist, although his father promoted the sociopolitical and nationalist connections of the family with the Serbian Orthodox Church. Milo≈°eviƒá's mother taught astrology to Marko and his ten-year-older sister Marija. Milo≈°eviƒá was widely reported a spoilt teenager, manipulative, uninterested in schooling, and self-conscious about his skinniness. At a private school in Belgrade, he lived with his mother's extended family in Po≈æarevac, having more personal exposure to bodyguards than to his parents. He also began collecting guns and cars, and dropped out of high school.Harden, Blaine. \\"A Milosevic Field of Dreams: Bambipark\\", New York Times, Section A, Page 6, Column 1, dated 6 July 1999. Organized crime Taking an interest in car-racing, Milo≈°eviƒá's first exposure to the profitability of organized crime came from interactions with car-racing team member Vlada Kovaƒçeviƒá, who sold vehicles to Serbian paramilitary commanders operating in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. After dodging the military draft by being deemed \\"unfit\\" for service, Milo≈°eviƒá turned to his father's access to state revenue to fund a lavish lifestyle and establish a criminal network in Po≈æarevac. Around 1994, Milo≈°eviƒá was provided a job running a newly retrofit night club in Po≈æarevac called Madona that catered to the elites of southeastern Europe, including wanted members of Serbian organized criminal organizations. Milo≈°eviƒá is accused of involvement in smuggling numerous goods through Serbia, including cigarettes, petroleum, stolen cars, and drugs such as cocaine, which he is purported to use. Milo≈°eviƒá also took ownership of a radio station, bakery, computer store, luxury perfume shop named Scandal, and was appointed deputy chairman of a horse show in Ljubiƒçevo. Other sources of revenue included currency speculation and trade between dinars and Deutsche Marks, and management of the construction of a $380,000 Serbian nationalist theme park called Bambipark. Marko would wear a military uniform while managing Bambipark to show his patriotism during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. By 1998, he had purchased an expansive new villa in Po≈æarevac, owned and crashed over 17 luxury cars, and purchased a yacht for 500,000 Deutsche Marks. In 2000, the total black market assets held by Milo≈°eviƒá were estimated at ¬£500 million. Milo≈°eviƒá used violence and intimidation to expand and control his black market empire, suppressing rival gangs and the Serbian media. This use of violence included alleged connections to the 15 January 2000 killing of paramilitary leader and business competitor ≈Ωeljko Ra≈ænatoviƒá in Belgrade. Fall of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá On 5 October 2000, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's administration was replaced by a democratically elected government. This removed Marko from access to state revenue, power, and protection. Scandal and Madona were both vandalized and destroyed by anti-Milo≈°eviƒá demonstrators. Marko fled Serbia for Moscow with his sister Marija, mother Mira, and uncle Borislav. He then attempted to continue on to Beijing, but was deported back to Russia on 9 October 2000 for possession of a fake passport. Milo≈°eviƒá may have attempted to travel to China because of the ¬£100 million allegedly laundered into Chinese banks by the Milo≈°eviƒá family. After fleeing Serbia, a factional conflict broke out among the Serbian mafia to seize the local power and assets previously held by Marko. Organized crime remains a major security issue in Serbia.OSCE. \\"Report on OSCE Activities in the Fight Against Organized Crime in 2011,\\" OSCE Secretariat: Vienna, Austria. 2012. Marko Milo≈°eviƒá's location is not known, but it is assumed that he is living in Russia with his wife Milica Gajiƒá and son Marko. Russia has granted Marko and his family refugee status, although he is wanted by the Serbian government for several offenses, and has been issued a travel ban by the European Union. Complaints over father's death Marko Milo≈°eviƒá sent a letter to The President of the ICTY, The Chairman of the Security Council of the OUN, The Secretary General of the OUN, and to Judge Parker who led the investigation into Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's death accusing the Hague Tribunal for negligence and for the death of his father. In one part of the letter, Milo≈°eviƒá avers his father was not poisoned and accuses the ICTY of being misleading.

Originally, post-war plans called for air defence to be the responsibility of reserve, auxiliary squadrons only. Vampire jet fighters and older P-51 Mustangs were earmarked for these squadrons. With the rise of the \\"Iron Curtain\\" and the increasing tension in Europe, a change was seen as necessary and regular, full-time squadrons became the force's frontline. In December 1948, No. 1 Air Defence Group was created in Ottawa, Ontario. In November 1949 Group Headquarters moved to RCAF Station St. Hubert, Quebec. No. 1 Air Defence Group became Air Defence Command in June 1951. The command reached its highest strength in 1955, by which time nine Regular Force squadrons (flying Avro Canada CF-100 Canucks) and ten Auxiliary squadrons (flying Vampires and Mustangs) fell under its control. Among the reserve/Auxiliary squadrons was No. 401 Squadron RCAF, flying from St. Hubert and Montreal. De Havilland Vampires served in both operational and air reserve units (Nos 400, 401, 402, 411, 438 and 442 Squadrons RCAF) until retirement in the late 1950s when they was replaced by the Canadair Sabre. Among the CF-100 units were: *No. 428 Squadron RCAF, the first CF-100 All-Weather Fighter Squadron, 1954 - 1961. *No. 410 Squadron RCAF, flying CF-100s from RCAF Station Uplands, Ontario (1956-) *No. 414 Squadron RCAF, flying CF-100s and later CF-101 Voodoos from RCAF Station North Bay, 1957-64 *No. 433 Squadron RCAF, flying CF-100s, 1955-1961 *No. 445 Squadron RCAF, flying CF-100s from North Bay, 1 April to 31 August 1953. As equipment capability increased, and the perceived Soviet bomber threat diminished, the requirement for numbers decreased, and the nine CF-100 squadrons were replaced by five CF-101 squadrons, which later fell to three. The auxiliary squadrons also lost their air defence role. At the same time, the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line radar stations, largely operated by the RCAF, were built across Canada because of the growing Soviet nuclear threat. In September 1957, the Command became part of the new North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). On January 1, 1957, the Commander- in-Chief of the U.S. joint-service Continental Air Defense Command placed the US defenses in a geometric \\"Canadian Northeast Area\\" under the operational control of the Canadian Air Defence Command. Air Defence Command headquarters moved to CFB North Bay, Ontario, in August 1966. In 1968 the units of the command were listed as:http://jfchalifoux.com/caf_commands_and_their_units.htm *No. 409 AW (F) Squadron CFB Comox, British Columbia.

In 1974 CFB Chatham, St. Margarets Detachment became the site for a Satellite Tracking Unit (SITU). In September 1975 the Command was reduced to Air Defence Group and came under command of Air Command. In 1984 Air Defence Group was renamed as Fighter Group. In 1987 Fighter Group was merged with Canadian NORAD Region to create a unified air defence command for Canada. Fighter Group/Canadian NORAD Region was amalgamated into 1 Canadian Air Division on its formation in 1997.  Notes   References and further reading  Milberry, Lawrence \\"Larry\\" (1984).

His work has been translated into several languages. He has played a role in national and international mathematical competitions since 1970. Engel was one of the first to recognize the impact of electronic calculators and computers on mathematics teaching. In his view the focus should shift from learning how to apply algorithms, which could now be done by the machine, to learning how to build and test algorithms. He was also early to see the value of using computers to draw students into an interest and understanding of mathematics. Career Arthur Engel was born in 1928. He graduated from the University of Stuttgart in 1952, and was a secondary school teacher for 18 years. In 1970 he became an associate professor at the Ludwigsburg University of Education, a teacher's training institution. Engel is a former Professor of the Institut f√ºr Didaktik der Mathematik und der Informatik (Institute for teaching mathematics and computer science) of Goethe University Frankfurt. (German \\"Ehemalige\\" = English \\"former\\") Engel began to push for establishment of the Bundeswettbewerb Mathematik (Federal Mathematics Competition) as early as 1965. The first competition was held in 1970. He was leader of the first German team to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), held in Belgrade in 1977. He was leader of the German IMO delegation until 1984. Engel, then at Frankfurt University, chaired the jury of the 30th IMO in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony (13‚Äì24 July 1989). An IMO sets six problems for the participants to solve. Two of the 1979 problems were proposed by Arthur Engel, and one in each of 1981, 1983, 1986 and 1987. In 1990 Engel was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany by the Minister of Education of West Germany. In 1991 he was among the first three recipients of the David Hilbert Award given by the World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions (WFNMC). The award was given for an article he published in 1987 in the WFNMC Journal \\"Mathematics Competitions\\" that discussed creating Mathematical Olympiad Problems, covering the different aspects of the subject in detail. Works Engel is the author or co-author of numerous textbooks, teaching aids and books and articles on teaching mathematics written in German and English. Some have been translated into French, Spanish and Polish. In his 1970 paper The Teaching of Probability in the Intermediate Grades, Engel described an activity in which students would first use a spinning device to generate a random series of numbers, then use devices to create a series where the spins were not independent, simulating a Markov process. An Australian teacher built on this to introduce students to a simple model of the weather. In his 1975 Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und Statistik (Probability and Statistics) volume 2, Engel provided a chip-moving algorithm that could be used to determine the basic descriptive qualities of an absorbing Markov chain. The algorithm depended on recurrence of the initial distribution of chips, which Engel said had been proved by L. Scheller but not published. A proof was published in 2006 by J. Laurie Snell. In his 1984 Elementary Mathematics from an Algorithmic Standpoint Engel had the insight that with computers and calculators widely available, students would no longer accept rote learning of algorithms that could be executed mechanically. He proposed that mathematics in schools should instead focus on the concept of the algorithm, and the syllabus should be completely revised to take an \\"algorithmic standpoint\\". His proposed approach would focus on construction and testing of algorithms rather than their execution. Arthur Engel was one of the first to recognize the value of computer programming in teaching mathematics. Engel's 1993 Exploring Mathematics with Your Computer, draws from number theory, probability, statistics, combinatorics, numerical algorithms and many other fields. The book is primarily written for teachers. The book has been criticized for failing to provide motivation before discussing topics, called \\"a nice idea, not very well executed\\". However the book has also been called \\"a collection of gems ... a rich banquet.\\" Another reviewer called this book \\"an excellent source of ideas for computer-based activities that engage students in mathematical explorations. A third reviewer said \\"Those who have met examples of Arthur Engel's work will know what to expect, and this is another example of his astonishing versatility.\\" Engel's 1998 Problem-Solving Strategies has been described as the \\"most complete training book available for secondary and collegiate mathematics contests ... Beautiful mathematics abounds...\\" Partial bibliography             References University of Stuttgart alumni 20th-century German mathematicians German educational theorists 20th-century educational theorists Goethe University Frankfurt faculty 1928 births Living people Recipients of the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Ludwigsburg University of Education faculty ","title":"Arthur Engel (mathematician)"},{"id":"42562950","text":"Bungo is a bairro of Luanda, the capital city of Angola.

History In 1837 David Filby, an instrument- maker from Husum, founded a trading house for nautical instruments and maps, which was acquired in 1862 by Hamburg citizen Carl Christian Plath. Further reorganisations and investment followed, for example in the company Cassens & Bennecke, which, operating from 1909 under the name Cassens & Plath, was engaged in the sale of navigation devices in Bremerhaven, or Weems und Plath in Annapolis, USA, until C. Plath KG was founded in 1939. In 1950 C. Plath KG set up a department for the development of radio navigation in its so-called Compass House,Photo of Compass House on einestages.spiegel.de a symbol of the port of Hamburg for decades. This department was headed by Maximilian W√§chtler, regarded as a pioneer in radiolocation and radio and remote intelligence (recipient of the Rudolf-Diesel-Medaille), holding more than sixty patents in this field.Bernd Horstmann (Hrsg.): Funkpeilen gestern, heute, morgen. Maximilian W√§chtler 80 Jahre, 2nd edition, Hamburg 1981. Following the incorporation of parts of the signalling company founded in Kiel in 1911, this department eventually became C. Plath GmbH ‚Äì what is now PLATH GmbH. The PLATH group now encompasses PLATH and its subsidiaries innoSysTec, PROCITEC, PLATH EFT and PLATH AG. The group is now majority-owned by the Handelsgesellschaft Scharfe mbH & Co. KG family business. C. Plath KG, on the other hand, became part of LITEF GmbH, now known as Northrop Grumman LITEF. Due to its origins and the many similar-sounding names, PLATH GmbH is often wrongly regarded as the successor of C. Plath KG and associated with compasses and other navigation devices. Previous managing directors of C. Plath GmbH included Mr. Pfaff, who was CEO from 1989 to 1997 and who, together with Oberst and D. Grabau, wrote some of the basic literature on communication intelligence,Rudolf Grabau, Klaus Pfaff (Hrsg.): Funkpeiltechnik. Franckh‚Äôsche Verlagshandlung, Stuttgart 1989. and which is still used today in the training of the German Bundeswehr's electronic warfare section and are standard intelligence literature.

It was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) in 1905 and closed to passenger use in 1935, but remained open to freight traffic until 1964. Construction and opening The station was on the NSR branch from Leekbrook Junction to . The single line branch was authorised on 1 March 1899 by the Leek, Caldon Low, and Hartington Light Railways Order, 1898. and construction took several years. The station at Bradnop was built in a cutting on the long gradient from Leek Brook to Ipstones, digging the cutting required the excavation of of material to create a cutting long and, at its deepest, deep. Station layout The station site in 1962 showing the goods yard high above the main running line The station had a single platform and limited goods facilities. Although the station buildings and passenger platform were in a cutting, the small goods yard was constructed at the top of the bank and this necessitated quite a steep gradient in the track leading from the branch line to the good yard. A passing loop was installed and Bradnop was a block section with and Leek Brook East signalboxes, although Bradnop itself was not equipped with a signal box, only a ground frame. In NSR days the station staff comprised a Station Master, 1 porter and 1 porter/signalman. The station buildings were of wooden construction and had to be rebuilt following a fire in April 1926 which destroyed the original building. Closure The branch line was never a financial success and passenger services were withdrawn on 30 September 1935. The station remained open as a goods station until May 1964 when all traffic on the branch except mineral worksings from Caldon Low quarries was withdrawn.  The site today  Mineral trains to Caldon Low continued until 1989 when the line was mothballed. In 2009 Moorland and City Railways purchased the line with the intention of reopening the line to mineral traffic from the quarry. In 2014 this plan was placed on hold as the Competition Commission ruled that Lafarge Tarmac must sell one of its sites, possibly Caldon Low, so the heritage railway, the Churnet Valley Railway, are seeking to purchase the line themselves.

In his teenage years, he had singing classes with Lucille Dumont and later voice pitch classes with Eliane Catella. He record his first disk, with the help of Pierre Nol√®s, under the label Carol containing the songs ‚ÄúDis-moi‚Äù and ‚ÄúJe t'ai dit‚Äù in 1960. Unfortunately, Fleur de Lys company, the owner of Carol, went bankrupt. At 17 years old, Michel meets Georges Tremblay and together they record a second disk with the record label company London. The disk contains ‚ÄúTu ris de mes peines‚Äù and ‚ÄúDany‚Äù. The third disk, also with London, contains ‚ÄúAupr√®s de toi‚Äù and ‚ÄúUne larme sur ta joue‚Äù. In 1963, he makes the acquaintance of Mich√®le Richard and she introduced him to Russell Marois, the owner of M√©t√©or, a record label company based in Sherbrooke. He is put under contract with M√©t√©or to record 5 disks. Many of the recordings ( ‚ÄúSi j‚Äôavais un marteau‚Äù, ‚ÄúUne larme‚Äù, ‚ÄúUn jour‚Äù, ‚ÄúApr√®s ton d√©part‚Äù and ‚ÄúMa V√©nus‚Äù) make it on the Quebecker songs chart. In 1966, after the end of his contract with M√©t√©or, he signs another contract with Beaumont, a record label company. His first instrumental disk under Beaumont contains the hits ‚ÄúHava nagila √† go go‚Äù and ‚ÄúMinuit‚Äù. On this disk, Michel plays the organ. Later with his older sister, Claudette Henry, who is a singer-songwriter, he records a second disk containing ‚ÄúNe t'en va pas‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa chance me sourit‚Äù. Michel takes part in many television shows at CHLT, a Sherbrooke TV station and also at Jeunesse d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui, a popular live music tv show with the hits of the week.

Composite materials are used in a wide range of applications in aerospace, marine, automotive, surface transport and sports equipment markets. Damage to composite components is not always visible to the naked eye and the extent of damage is best determined for structural components by suitable Non Destructive Test (NDT) methods. The concept for composite repair of composite or metallic structures is simple. The bonded repair reduces stresses in the damaged region and keeps the cracks from opening and therefore from growing.  Composite structures of interest  Figure 1: Composite structures (a) laminated and (b) sandwich The composite structures of interest are mainly components composed of laminated plies or sandwich structures as shown in Figure 1. Laminate structures are assembled so that the fibre orientation provides most of the desired mechanical properties and the matrix largely determines the environmental performance. In sandwich structures thin, high strength skins are separated by, and bonded to, lightweight honeycomb cores; the thicker the core the stiffer the panel with minimal weight increase.  Typical damage of composite structures  Figure 2: Typical damage cases of laminates and sandwich structures The most important damage to fibre reinforced composites is the result of impact incidents. Low velocity and high velocity impact can result in significantly different damage patterns for a given composite configuration. In metals the impact energy is dissipated through elastic and plastic deformations and still the structure retains a good margin of structural integrity. In fibre reinforced composite materials however, the damage is usually more extensive than that seen on the surface. Some typical damage cases for composite structures are shown in Figure 2. In monolithic laminates the underlying damage can extend to a much greater extent than the barely visible evidence on its surface. Other type of damage is laminate splitting. Here the damage does not extend through the full length of the part. The effects on the mechanical performance depend on the length of split relative to the component thickness. In sandwich structures, impact results in dents of various sizes and depending on the energy levels, puncture damage is not unusual. In this case both skins may be damaged. Other common damage types include heat damage and bolt hole damage. The heat damage is caused by the exposure at high temperature which causes a local fracture with separation of surface plies. The bolt hole damage is cause by the bearing stresses at the contact surfaces of the composite structure with a bolt or rivet used for joining purposes. This could result in elongation of the hole causing laminate splitting, or damage to the upper plies. In any case, the effect on the mechanical performance depends on the thickness of the damaged part. Further implications, apart from the initial impact damage, come from the exposure of the damaged area to moisture and other degrading factors like chemicals, lubricants, fuel, hydraulic fluids, etc. The presence of such environments may result in further deterioration of the mechanical performance.  Repair flow chart  Figure 3: Typical composite repair flowchart When performing a composite repair there are certain steps that should be followed. In Figure 3, a typical composite repair flowchart is given. The first step in the procedure should be a careful damage assessment. Some damage to composites is obvious and easily assessed but in many cases the damage may first appear quite small, although the real damage is very much greater. Impact damage to a fibre can appear as a small dent on the reinforced composite surface but the underlying damage can be much more extensive. The decision to repair or scrap is determined by considering the extent of repair needed to replace the original structural performance of the composite. Other considerations are the repair costs, the position and accessibility of the damage and the availability of suitable repair materials. The initial assessment will determine the repair type to be performed. Easy repairs are usually small or do not affect the structural integrity of the component. These repairs are made by following the simple guidelines indicated for laminate or sandwich panels. Complex repairs are needed when the damage is extensive and needs to replace the structural performance of the component. The best choice of materials would be to use the original fibres, fabrics and matrix resin. Any alternative would need careful consideration of the service environment of the repaired composite, i.e. hot, wet and mechanical performance. The proposed repair scheme should meet all the original design requirements for the structure. Some repairs need the specialist equipment of the workshop and some form of improvised repair is needed to return the component to a suitable repair workshop. A temporary repair, usually in the form of a patch, can be fixed to the component to ensure safety until the component can be repaired at a later date. For a permanent repair all the approved general guidelines for laminate and sandwich repairs should be followed. These repair operations should be carried out in controlled workshop areas to ensure high quality. Operating in a controlled environment and attention to the detail will ensure success. Before returning to service the quality check is always required. For comprehensive inspection of repaired parts, a number of Nondestructive Tests (NDT) can be used. Special attention should be given to the quality of the repaired area and more specifically to the interface between the original part and the repaired area. Usual inspection methods include some form of ultrasonic or X-ray inspection.  Typical composite repairs  A typical composite repair usually starts after damage detection either by unarmed eye or various other NDT-techniques. After evaluating the extent of the damage, the damage zone is prepared for reparation. This is done by removing the composite material around the damage zone 1. Three techniques are known to be utilized, being slightly different depending on the nature of the composite, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Typical laminate and sandwich repairs When a composite repair is applied the proper surface treatment is essential for a successful result. The above- mentioned repairs can be time consuming and often require high skills and experience to be performed. This is why current developments tend to focus on automating this process either by advanced mechanical milling or alternate technologies like nanosecond-pulsed lasers 2-3. After the damage zone has been completely excavated, surfaces are cleaned and further prepared for the final repair by patches. This can be done by plasma burning of surface contaminants, exposing fibres by removing matrix material through laser radiation or improving the surface wettability for adhesives by photochemical reactions induced by UV-laser light 4. In a typical repair, the patch is applied under vacuum and at temperatures high enough for the curing of the adhesive. For these purposes a portable hot bonder device may be used for in the field repairs. For more complex and higher quality repairs an autoclave should be used. A hot bonder unit is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: Typical hot bonder portable unit. It can apply vacuum, heat up the repair area and constantly monitor and regulate temperature In any case, the application of a vacuum bag is a necessary step for high quality repairs. Vacuum bag processing is suited to components with thin sections and large sandwich structures. The vacuum bag technique involves the placing and sealing of a flexible bag over a composite lay-up and evacuating all the air from under the bag as schematically shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Left: Details of vacuum bag lay-up. Right: Vacuum bag sealing and vacuum application results in atmospheric pressure on the repair region (prepreg) The removal of air forces the bag down onto the lay-up with consolidation pressure of 1 atmosphere (1 bar). The completed assembly, with vacuum still applied, is heated up to the desired temperature for curing. This can be achieved by using heating mat or by placing the assembly inside an oven with good air circulation. For thicker sections and high quality bonding, the use of an autoclave with regulated temperature and additional overpressure should be sought. The most important technical challenges in the implementation of a successful composite patch repair are: (a) proper design of the repair patch and the procedures that will be followed, (b) selection of the most suitable materials and tools for the application, (c) careful surface preparation, (d) implementation of the composite patch repair and careful application of the cure cycle, (e) non-destructive evaluation of the repair by suitable methodology and, (f) monitoring of the structural integrity of the repair either at specific time intervals either continuously.

Hollywood on the Tiber is a phrase used to describe the period in the 1950s and 1960s when the Italian capital of Rome emerged as a major location for international filmmaking attracting many foreign productions to the Cinecitt√† studios. By contrast to the native Italian film industry, these movies were made in English for global release. Although the primary markets for such films were American and British audiences, they enjoyed widespread popularity in other countries, including Italy. The commercial success of Quo Vadis (1951) led to a stream of blockbusters produced in Italy by Hollywood studios, which reached its height with 20th Century Fox's Cleopatra in 1963. The phrase \\"Hollywood on Tiber\\", a reference to the river that runs through Rome, was coined in 1950 by Time Magazine during the making of Quo Vadis.Wrigley p.52 Background Following World War II, Hollywood studios increasingly shifted production abroad both to take advantage of lower costs and to use frozen funds (profits from American films which foreign governments barred from export). These films, known as runaway productions, could also benefit from local subsidies. By the early 1950s, some of the largest-budget American films were being shot in European countries, particularly in Britain and Italy.Balio p.228 In both countries newly arrived American companies worked alongside continuing large- scale domestic film industries. In Italy, the film-makers used the vast Cinecitt√† complex which had been built in the 1930s by Benito Mussolini's Fascist regime which was aiming to rebuild Italian cinema. Following Mussolini's overthrow in 1943, production at Cinecitt√† was suspended and no new films were made until 1948.Gundle p.261 Height The expression refers to the Tiber which runs through Rome. Although American companies had shot in Italy before (such as Fox's 1922 silent Nero and MGM's 1925 Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ), the scale of the post-war investment was unprecedented. Many of the films were sword and sandal epics, often set in Ancient Rome which required large film sets and location filming. Other films included contemporary-set romances Roman Holiday (1953) and Three Coins in the Fountain (1954).Balio p.228 The companies imported actors from a variety of countries (particularly Britain and the United States), who appeared alongside Italians who generally played smaller, supporting roles or extras. Sophia Loren was a notable Italian star with sufficient international appeal to be cast in a leading role. In 1962, the lengthy and troubled production of Cleopatra brought further media attention to the city. The delays led to a spiraling budget, making it the most expensive film ever made at the time.Bondanella p.161 Far from leading to a decline in Italian cinema, the native industry boomed during the era. In 1960, Italian films outperformed American imports to Italy for the first time since 1946.McElhaney p.146 However, there was a growing influence of Hollywood-style productions, as popular Italian genres such as the Sword-and-sandal and Spaghetti Western attempted to imitate successful Hollywood productions. Italian actors and directors often adopted English-sounding names.Bondanella p.339 Later years Cinecitt√† was at the peak of its international fame between the production of Ben Hur and Cleopatra (1958-1960).Torriglia p.60 As the 1960s drew on, the fashion for classical epics began to decline following the commercial failure of The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), although films in other genres such as David Lean's Doctor Zhivago (1965) continued to be profitable. In 2009 a documentary film Hollywood on the Tiber was released. It portrays Cinecitt√† and the various stars who worked there between 1950 and 1970.

A youthful soldier of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, he like his father declined to claim the title Lord Somerville, but wrote an extensive work on his ancestry, later edited by Walter Scott. Early life Baptised on 24 January 1632 at Newhall in Lanarkshire, he was eldest and only surviving son of James Somerville of The Drum (by right, tenth Lord Somerville) and Lilias, second daughter of Sir James Bannatyne of Newhall, a lord of session. James's father had gained military experience in France, as an officer in the Scots guard of Louis XIII. On the outbreak of the First Bishops' War in 1639, the elder Somerville joined the covenanting levies under General Alexander Leslie, and with the rank of major had a leading command at the siege of Edinburgh Castle in 1640. James joined his father's company at this siege. Campaign against Cromwell In 1645 the teenage Somerville was present at David Leslie's first cavalry muster on the Gleds Muir, Tranent. The death of both his younger brothers in 1647 left him the only heir male of his house, and his parents said that he should never leave Scotland. In 1648 his father, having purchased from a cousin the old family seat at Cambusnethan in Lanarkshire, moved there from The Drum, and arranged for his son's marriage with Martha Bannatyne of Corhouse. After Oliver Cromwell's advance into Scotland, the match was put off. The Scots levies concentrated at Edinburgh. Somerville went there with his father, and served in the retinue of the Earl of Eglinton, captain of the king's guard of horse. He saw service, at most of the military actions which took place between the two armies, including the Battle of Dunbar (3 September 1650). After Dunbar, Somerville returned to Cambusnethan, and found it partially occupied by levies of the Presbyterian Association, with whom he had a sharp skirmish. Then in company with Bannatyne of Corhouse, his intended father-in-law, he went north to Perth where Charles II held court. Towards the end of November he returned with his cousin, Major-general Robert Montgomery, who was in command of a body of cavalry that was designed either to operate against, or come to terms with, the Association levies under Colonels Gilbert Ker and Archibald Strachan. After Montgomery had passed Stirling and was on the road to Dumbarton, he gave Somerville a commission to discover if the Association forces were willing to come to an agreement. He went to Renfrew, and arrived in time to take part in a concentration of Royalist forces on Ruglen, which was intended to check Cromwell's advance on Hamilton. Four Cromwellian regiments of cavalry (Lord Kirkcudbright's, Colonel Strachan's, Ker's, and Halkett's), then made a night march on Hamilton, and occupied the town, but, after a sharp encounter, were driven out and dispersed the next morning. Somerville, after sending a message to Montgomery, spent three days with the laird of Cathcart, till the country was clear, and then returned to Cambusnethan. Cromwell, however, had rapidly regarrisoned Hamilton, and was making the country dangerous for the Royalists. Somerville and his father therefore retired over the Forth, and were present at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651. With other Royalists they then paid their respects to the Duke of Hamilton, who was with the Earl of Crawford at the Struthers, Fifeshire. Somerville's father placed him in the king's guard, again only as a volunteer. When Charles II decided to march into England, Somerville senior removed his son from the royal guard, to keep him in Scotland. The army's line of march passed within a short distance of the Corhouse, where Martha Bannatyne, Somerville's bethrothed, was living; she sent Somerville junior a message, prompted by Somerville senior. He came and was shut until the army was too far off to be rejoined. The couple married at Lesmahagow church on 13 November 1651, after the Royalist defeat at the Battle of Worcester, with James Somerville still 18 years old. Later life The death of his father on 3 January 1677 left Somerville as the successor to the family peerage; but, like his father, he declined to assume the title. He died in 1690. Works Somerville collated the records of his family, and completed in 1679 The Memorie of the Somervilles, written mainly for his sons. The two folio volumes remained unprinted among the family papers until 1815, when they were edited by Sir Walter Scott, and published with notes and corrections (Edinburgh, 2 vols.). Family By his first wife, who died in 1676, Somerville had three sons: James, born 26 Aug. 1652; John; and George. On 15 March 1685 he married, secondly, Margaret Jamieson, and had issue a daughter Margaret (b. 1686) and a son Hugh (b. 1688). The Somerville title remained in abeyance until it was recovered by a great-grandson, James Somerville, 13th Lord Somerville.

It was considered by many to be a long-overdue addition to the University. Facilities The Sports Centre has a 37m x 34m Sports Hall with line markings for basketball, korfball, volleyball, five-a-side football, badminton, and netball. It also has tiered seating for up to 400 spectators. The Fitness, Strength and Conditioning Suite is made up of a Fitness Suite, containing cardiovascular machines such as treadmills, ski ergs, and Jacobs Ladders, and a Strength and Conditioning Room, with eight Olympic lifting platforms and a two-lane plyometric track. There is a multi-purpose room for floor-based sports and classes such as fencing, martial arts, yoga, and Zumba, and there are Eton and Rugby Fives courts. There are also five glass-backed squash courts and a team-training area used by many university sports clubs.

It had an AN/FPS-17, an AN/FPS-78 (used during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis' Falling Leaves radar network), and the last Avco AN/FSS-7 SLBM Detection Radar. Northeast of Laredo, Texas, located at and supported by the city's Laredo Air Force Base, Laredo AFS tracked White Sands Missile Range tests, provided satellite tracks such as for the 1958 Sputnik III to Project Harvest Moon, and sent missile warning data to Cheyenne Mountain Complex's CCPDS computers. Laredo test site On July 22, 1955, the military site was acquired (Air Training Command constructed the site) and in 1955, \\"an operations building for a high-power longrange radar facility was completed.\\" Funding for the site was \\"from a special Air Force appropriation\\" and Rome Air Development Center was responsible for installation and operation of the site, which became operational in 1956.

In July 1961 Air Defense Command acquired the site and by the end of 1961, the station had been developed with structures like ADC Permanent System radar stations (numerous planned Aircraft Control and Warning radars for NORAD monitoring over Mexico were cancelled.) Buildings included barracks, an orderly room building, etc. 1961 test sites at Trinidad and Laredo transferred from RADC on July 1. By 1962, an AN/FPS-78 was at the Laredo Test Site, and it was used during the Cuban Missile Crisis to sweep over the trajectory area from Cuba after the sweep by an Alabama radar and before a New Jersey radar. Laredo sensor site The Laredo Sensor Site was the station's name by August 30, 1961; and operations included projecting \\"an enlarged image of radar scope film [onto] a finely graduated scale on [a] screen\\" for tracking precision. \\"The Laredo sensor was deactivated on 15 July 1964\\"Cite NORAD Historical Summary 1964B (July‚ÄìDecember) p. 63 and the \\"Air Force...reactivated it on 1 April 1966\\" (the 4783rd Surveillance Squadron was the station's 2nd unit, and the 665th Radar Squadron was also at the station.)

They always believe in the ideology that life could be adventurous in creating new paths rather than walking in the good old beaten path. These three choose the creative field as it could fill their creative thirst. In certain situation, they meet Malathi. Malathi falls in love with Kittu in the process. Looking at the creative dimension in these three guys, she introduces them to Gandam, who runs creative agency. Gandam is quite ebullient person and likes the creative approach in these three boys. Gandam already gathered many rivalries in the market because of the tough competition he gives to others. With these three guys joining the company it becomes highly impossible for others to sustain in the market. With company's rapid growth and success they all decide to party in an abandoned place far from city. All of them get fully drunk and slowly move into a nearby cemetery. Vamshi who is also a photographer plans a prank to fool Gandam. They all go into sleep only to find that Gandam is missing. The practical joke played by three guys misfires and they become the prime suspects behind the Gandam's missing case. How these three guys prove their innocence makes the rest of the story.  Box office  Rendella Tharuvatha, released on 29 July 2005, proved to be a box office disaster in its first week. The film failed to recover its budget. Soundtrack Critical reception The film received mostly negative reviews from the critics. Cine Goer - There appears to be a war between the story writer and director function within Anand who handled both. He appears to have not been able to deal with the crime part of the film that comes towards the end. Telugu Cinema - KB.Anand seems to have inspired by Aitey's success and started a film in that manner but his futile effort to weave a kidnap drama out of nothing is tiresome and illogical. Idle Brain - First half of the film is OK. Second half of the film is boring. The climax of the film is very badly handled. The Hindu - The minus points of the film are poor screenplay, inability to handle the climax and especially failure to maintain the suspense.

Early life LaTulippe was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His father's job as a casket salesman caused his family to move across the United States between numerous cities before they settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. LaTulippe attended James Madison University in Virginia, where he studied film and writing. Career Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, California, LaTulippe was hired as a script reader at New Line Cinema, a job he was offered by his friend who worked at the studio. After working there for two years, he tired of the job, saying that it \\"start[ed] to suck away [my] creativity\\". In July 2008, he sold a spec script titled Going the Distance to New Line Cinema, a story based on his friend David Neustadter's previous long-term relationship. The film was ultimately directed by Nanette Burstein and released in September 2010. After selling his first screenplay, he quit his job as a script reader and became a full-time writer. It was announced in 2009 that LaTulippe would write a film adaptation of Breathers: A Zombie's Lament, a novel by S. G. Browne, although the film is yet to go into production. In 2011, he was approached by the talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME) to create a humorous short film about their company. The result was Yom Kippur at WME, which starred J. B. Smoove. The short film's popularity snowballed and it caught the attention of Adam Goodman, the president of Paramount Film Group, who then contacted LaTulippe to offer him a job as a film director. In 2012 Paramount announced that LaTulippe would direct an as-yet unnamed film for the studio.

It is subject to supervision by the Swiss Federal Electricity Commission ElCom.  History  Swissgrid was established in January 2005 by Switzerland‚Äôs main electricity grid companies as part of the liberalisation of the electricity market. From 15 December 2006 Swissgrid coordinated Switzerland's transmission grid (380/220 kV), comprised up to that point of eight control areas. With the changeover on the night of 31 December 2008 to 1 January 2009 from eight control areas to one zone covering the whole of Switzerland, Swissgrid took over the operation of the entire 6,700-kilometre extra high-voltage grid.Swissgrid - Company When the transfer was entered in the commercial register on 3 January 2013, Swissgrid became the new owner of the Swiss transmission grid. Swiss transmission system operator Swissgrid has since been responsible not only for the operation of the transmission grid but also for its maintenance, renewal and expansion.Swissgrid does all this The statutory requirement was thus met for the electricity companies to have completed the transfer of the transmission grid to Swissgrid by 1 January 2013 at the latest.  Organisation  Swissgrid includes four corporate divisions: Grid Infrastructure, Market, Technology and Corporate Services.Swissgrid's Executive Board The members of the Executive Board are: * Yves Zumwald, CEO * Doris Barnert, Head of Corporate Services / CFO * Maurice Dierick, Head of Market * Adrian H√§sler, Head of Grid Infrastructure * Rainer M√ºhlberger, Head of Technology The Electricity Supply Act requires that the majority of Members and the Chairman of the Board of Directors, as well as the Members of the Executive, do not belong to the boards of any legal entities which are engaged in activities in the fields of electricity generation or sales, or are in a service-provision relationship with any such legal entities. At present the Board of Directors is made up of five independents and four industry representatives. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is appointed from among the independents.  Cooperative ventures  In the context of the European exchange of electricity, the company was a member of the European grid association, the \\"Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity\\" (UCTE) and of the organisation of the European transmission grid operators (European Transmission System Operators, ETSO). These two associations have now been merged into the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), which was established in December 2008 in Prague and took up its operational role in the summer of 2009. Swissgrid is also a member of the TSO Security Cooperation (TSC)TSO Security Cooperation: Who we are and since November 2010 it has been a shareholder of the Capacity Allocation Service CompanyCASC: Bottleneck management in Europe (CASC).  KPIs of the Swiss transmission grid  The Swiss transmission grid, 6,700 km in length, operates at voltages of 220 kilovolts and 380 kilovolts and a frequency of 50 Hz. It has 145 switching substations and 12,000 electricity pylons.  Cost-covering remuneration for feed-in to the electricity grid (Pronovo)  In May 2017, the Swiss electorate adopted the Energy Act (Energiegesetz - EnG), which shall enter into force on 1 January 2018. Amongst other things, the Act stipulates that the collection of grid premiums, the CRF and one-off remuneration payments, and the issuing of guarantees of origin should be outsourced to an independent enforcement agency. Swissgrid has been directly responsible for these activities as an accredited certification body on behalf of the federal government since 2007. Pronovo AG is a wholly owned subsidiary of Swissgrid and will operate under the authority of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE). The headquarters of the subsidiary, which employs around 60 people, are located in Frick, Aargau. The newly created enforcement agency has begun its operations on 3 January 2018.

At this time prices of grain and other commodities were falling sharply, and the supply of credit dried up due to the decreased value of collateral goods. Many of the banks based in Amsterdam were over-leveraged and were interlinked by complex financial instruments, making them vulnerable to a sudden tightening of credit availability. The crisis was marked by the failure of one large bank - that of De Neufville - and many smaller financial enterprises. The extent of the crisis was mitigated by the provision of extra liquidity by the Bank of Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank. Similarities have been identified between these events and the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008.Narron, James, and David Skeie. \\"Crisis Chronicles: The Commercial Credit Crisis of 1763 and Today‚Äôs Tri-Party Repo Market.\\"Lessons from the Seven Years War by Isabel Schnabel and Hyun Song ShinQuinn, Stephen, and Williams Roberds. \\"Responding to a Shadow Banking Crisis: The Lessons of 1763.\\"  Background  On 10 February 1763, the Treaty of Hubertusburg was signed between Prussia, Austria and Saxony. This Treaty marked the end of the Seven Years' War, a war from 1756 to 1763 that involved all of the major European powers of the period. Berlin then became an emerging market, and Amsterdam‚Äôs merchant bankers were the primary sources of credit, with the Hamburg banking houses serving as intermediaries between the two. But early 1763, because of the end of the war, the abnormal high war prices plummeted by 30%; grain lost its value rapidly in May. Two months later more than 30 banking and trade firms went bankrupt, with an estimated debt of 10 million Dutch guilders. Some Amsterdam merchant bankers were leveraged far beyond their capacity. Financial activity in late- eighteenth-century Amsterdam was controlled by a group of merchant banking firms. These ‚Äúbankers‚Äù were proprietary firms that dealt in trade goods and that also provided financing to other merchants. These firms were not deposited banks in the English conventional tradition, as deposit taking was viewed as incredibly risky. Since deposits were scarce, financial intermediation was accomplished through a securitization scheme known as the acceptance loan. The building block of the acceptance loan was an instrument known as the bill of exchange ‚Äî ultimately a contract to pay a fixed sum of money at a future date. Bills of exchange were originally designed as short- term contracts but gradually became heavily used for long-term borrowing. They were typically rolled over and became de facto short-term loans to finance longer-term projects, which resulted in the creation of a classic balance sheet maturity mismatch. At that time, bills of exchange could be re-sold, with each seller serving as a guarantor to the bill and, by implication, insuring the buyer of the bill against default. This practice prevented the circulation of low-credit-quality bills among market participants and created a kind of ‚Äúcredit wrapper‚Äù‚Äîa guarantee for the specific loan‚Äîby making all signatories jointly liable for a particular bill. In addition, low acceptance fees‚Äîthe fees paid to market participants for taking on the obligation to pay the bill of exchange‚Äîimplied a perceived negligible risk. However, the complexity of this system had underlying ramifications - the practice also resulted in binding market participants together through their balance sheets: one bank might have a receivable asset and a payable liability for the same bill of exchange, even when no goods were traded. By the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, high leverage and balance sheet interconnectedness left merchant bankers highly vulnerable to any slowdown in credit availability. Merchant bankers believed that their balance sheet growth and leverage were hedged and insured through offsetting claims and liabilities. And while some of the more conservative Dutch bankers were wary in growing their wartime business, others expanded quickly. One of the fastest-growing merchant banks belonged to the De Neufville brothers, who speculated in depreciating currencies and endorsed a large number of bills of exchange. Leendert Pieter de Neufville was the leading perpetrator of the proliferation of the faulty bills of exchange. Noting his success, other merchant bankers followed suit. On 19/20 April Gotzkowsky bought a huge amount of grains (oats) through the intermediation of the Russian envoy Vladimir Sergeevich Dolgorukov (1717 - 1803).E. Ris, p. 37-38, 54; H. Rachel & P. Wallich, p. 448 It was stored in Kolberg and along Pommeranian coast, sitting unused after the Russian army had left the Poland. Both Russia and Prussia were hoping for a swift sale, that would allow for a discharge of the troops who had to guard these supplies. Because of a grain shortage and famine in Prussia, the transaction could have been profitable for Gotzkowsky and De Neufville, the latter one secretly collaborating with two partners Stein and Leveaux, all collectors of art. Neufville paid 100,000 guilders down payment (in exchange bills) on behalf of the buying syndicate. The remaining one million guilders were to be paid by Gotzkowsky in four terms, within a year. Two Russian traders, Sve≈°nikov and Rogovikov, would take over a 1/5 of the total grain sold.J.E. Gotzkowsky, p. 153, W.O. Henderson (1963), p. 55 The remaining 4/5 was allocated to Gotzkowsky, De Neufville, Leveaux und Stein.E. Ris, p. 39 The contract was signed by just two men: Gotzkowsky and Sve≈°nikov.N. Schepkowski, p. 341 On 12 April 1763, Frederick decided to dump his unused wartime grain supplies in Lower Silesia, leading in the next months to a 75% drop in the local price of wheat, with other commodities prices soon following.Schlesische Privilegirte Staats - Kriegs - und Friedens-Zeitungen. 1763-04-16 [Jg.22 No. 44]I. Lazcano, p. 7S. Quinn & W. Roberds (2012), Responding to a Shadow Banking Crisis: The Lessons of 1763, p. 16; I. Schnabel & H.S. Shin (2001), p. 15 On June 27, 1763, the Gotzkowsky transaction became a state affair.E. Ris, p. 45-46 Legal problems meant that the grain could not now be exported.E. Ris, p. 47 When it became clear that half of the grain was of bad quality, Gotzkowsky wanted to change the contract and offered to pay only 2/3 of 1.170.448 guilders owed? He would have been satisfied if he did not suffer any loss. On 18 July the Russian senate refused this offer and insisted on being paid promptly and demanded payment in Dutch guilders, and not in debased Saxon coins.E. Ris, p. 38, 39, 45, 54, 56, etc When Leveaux and Von Stein dropped out of the grain deal it must have come as a shock to De Neufville and Gotzkowsky. The restructuring of the Gotzkowsky deal put tremendous pressure on De Neufville, who then became responsible for 3/5 of the deal. Gotzkowsky had lent at least two million Reichstaler to Saxony to pay its war contribution to Frederick. Gotzkowsky had not yet sold all the municipal bonds he had received in return. Gotzkowsky had also an impressive number of paintings in stock which he accumulated during the war and managed a silkworks, a jewelry business, a porcelain factory (now KPM) that was not running at his satisfactory, all at the same time. By the end of July 1763, both Gotzkowsky and De Neufville had difficulty finding the 700.000 guilders needed to settle their obligations and feared they would go bankrupt.N. Schepkowski, pp. 340-343J.E. Gotzkowsky, p. 147-150 The failure of a firm of De Neufville‚Äôs size ‚Äì almost half as large as the Bank of Amsterdam itself ‚Äì shocked the markets. The immediate victims were a group of firms known as ‚Äúcashiers.‚Äù The cashiers were about 30‚Äì40 financial intermediaries whose activities formed a bridge between the large banks and merchants. Traditionally, the cashiers had served as brokers in the market for bank funds. By the last half of the eighteenth century, their activities had expanded to include the settlement of bills denominated in current guilders, deposit taking, and even the issue of cashier‚Äôs receipts that circulated locally as banknotes. The cashiers were run hard during the first days of the crisis, as panicked holders of cashier‚Äôs receipts demanded coin from the issuers. The contraction of the bill market put the Amsterdam merchant bankers under heavy pressure, as their ability to roll over funding was several constricted.

From the beginning of March 2014, in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Euromaidan movement, protests by Russia-backed anti-government separatist groups took place in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, collectively called the \\"Donbass\\". These demonstrations, which followed the February‚ÄìMarch 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, and which were part of a wider group of concurrent protests across southern and eastern Ukraine, escalated into an armed conflict between the separatist forces of the self- declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR respectively), and the Ukrainian government. While the initial protests were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government, Russia took advantage of them to launch a co-ordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine. Russians citizens led the separatist movement in Donetsk from April until August 2014, and were supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia.Strelkov/Girkin Demoted, Transnistrian Siloviki Strengthened in 'Donetsk People's Republic', Vladimir Socor, Jamestown Foundation, 15 August 2014 As the conflict escalated in May 2014, Russia employed a \\"hybrid approach\\", deploying a combination of disinformation tactics, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support to destabilise the Donbass region. According to the Ukrainian government, at the height of the conflict in the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries were reported to make up between 15% to 80% of the combatants. Ukraine launched a military counter-offensive against pro-Russian forces in April 2014, called the \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" (ATO) from 2014 until 2018, when it was renamed the \\"Joint Forces Operation\\" (JFO). By late August 2014 this operation was able to vastly shrink the territory under the control of the pro-Russian forces, and came close to regaining control of the Russo-Ukrainian border. In response, Russia abandoned its hybrid approach, and began a conventional invasion of the Donbass. Between 22 and 25 August 2014, Russian artillery, personnel, and what Russia called a \\"humanitarian convoy\\" crossed the border into Ukrainian territory without permission of the Ukrainian government. Crossings occurred both in areas under the control of pro-Russian forces and in areas that were not under their control, such as the south-eastern part of Donetsk Oblast, near Novoazovsk. These events followed the reported shelling of Ukrainian positions from the Russian side of the border over the course of the preceding month. Head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko characterised the events of 22 August as a \\"direct invasion by Russia of Ukraine\\", while other western and Ukrainian officials described the events as a \\"stealth invasion\\" of Ukraine by Russia. Russia's official position on the presence of Russian forces in Donbass has been vague: while official bodies have denied presence of \\"regular armed forces\\" in Ukraine, it has on numerous occasions confirmed presence of \\"military specialists\\", along with other euphemisms, usually accompanied by an argument that Russia \\"was forced\\" to deploy them to \\"defend the Russian-speaking population\\".The Interpreter quoted what Putin said during a live call-in session on 12 October 2016: \\"When we were forced, I want to stress, forced to defend the Russian-speaking population in the Donbass, forced to respond to the desire of the people living in Crimea to return to being part of the Russian Federation, they instantly began to whip up anti-Russian policies and the imposition of sanctions.\\" As a result of the invasion, DPR and LPR insurgents regained much of the territory they had lost during the Ukrainian government's preceding military offensive. Ukraine, Russia, the DPR and the LPR signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire, called the Minsk Protocol, on 5 September 2014. Violations of the ceasefire on both sides became common. Amidst the solidification of the line between insurgent and government-controlled territory during the ceasefire, warlords took control of swaths of land on the insurgent side, leading to further destabilisation. The ceasefire completely collapsed in January 2015, with renewed heavy fighting across the conflict zone, including at Donetsk International Airport and at Debaltseve. Involved parties agreed to a new ceasefire, called Minsk II, on 12 February 2015. Immediately following the signing of the agreement, separatist forces launched an offensive on Debaltseve and forced Ukrainian forces to withdraw from it. In the months after the fall of Debaltseve, minor skirmishes continued along the line of contact, but no territorial changes occurred. This state of stalemate led to the war being labelled a \\"frozen conflict\\"; despite this, the area remained a war zone, with dozens of soldiers and civilians killed each month. In 2017, on average one Ukrainian soldier died in combat every three days,In Ukraine It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas, and a Lot Less Like Russia, The Daily Signal (4 December 2017) Kurt Volker: The Full Transcript, Politico (27 November 2017) with the number of Russian and separatist troops remaining in the region estimated at 6,000 and 40,000 respectively. By the end of 2017, OSCE observatory mission had accounted for around 30,000 individuals in military-style dress crossing from Russia to Donbass just at two border checkpoints it was allowed to monitor. OSCE has also documented numerous cases of military convoys crossing from the Russian Federation into the occupied territory on dirt roads away from official border crossings and usually during the night. Since the start of the conflict there have been 29 ceasefires, each intended to remain in force indefinitely, but none of them stopped the violence. The most successful attempt to halt the fighting was in 2016, when a ceasefire held for six consecutive weeks. The latest (29th) ceasefire came into force on 27 July 2020 which led to no Ukrainian combat losses for more than a month. Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, the LPR, and the OSCE agreed to a roadmap for an end to the conflict on 1 October 2019. But by late summer 2020 an end to the conflict was not in sight.  Background  = Donetsk Oblast = Pro-Russian protesters in Donetsk, 9 March 2014 Attempts to seize the Donetsk Regional State Administration (RSA) building began since pro-Russian protests erupted in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine, in the wake of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. Pro-Russian protesters occupied the Donetsk RSA from 1 to 6 March 2014, before being removed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). On 6 April, 1,000‚Äì2,000 people gathered at a rally in Donetsk to demand a status referendum similar to the one held in Crimea in March. The demonstrators stormed the RSA building, and took control of its first two floors. They said that if an extraordinary legislative session was not held by regional officials to implement a status referendum, they would take control of the regional government with a \\"people's mandate\\", and dismiss all elected regional councillors and members of parliament. As these demands were not met, the activists held a meeting in the RSA building, and voted in favour of independence from Ukraine. They proclaimed the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) on 7 April 2014.Ukraine crisis: Protesters declare Donetsk 'republic', BBC News (7 April 2014) = Luhansk Oblast = Unrest in Luhansk Oblast began on 6 April, when approximately 1,000 activists seized and occupied the SBU building in the city of Luhansk, following similar occupations in the cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv. Protesters barricaded the building, and demanded that all arrested separatist leaders be released. Police were able to retake control of the building, but the demonstrators regathered for a 'people's assembly' outside the building and called for a 'people's government', demanding either federalisation or incorporation into the Russian Federation. At this assembly, they elected Valery Bolotov to the position of \\"People's Governor\\". Two referendums were announced, one on 11 May to determine whether the region should seek some form of autonomy, and a second scheduled for 18 May to determine whether the region should join the Russian Federation, or declare independence. The Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) was declared on 27 April. Representatives of the Republic demanded that Ukrainian government provide amnesty for all protesters, enshrine Russian as an official language, and hold a referendum on the status of the region. They issued an ultimatum that stated that if Kyiv did not meet their demands by 14:00 on 29 April, they would launch an insurgency in tandem with that of the Donetsk People's Republic.  History  = April 2014: conflict begins = Unmarked separatist militants seized the Donetsk city office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on 12 April without resistance. Following negotiations between the militants and those in the building, the chief of the office resigned from his post. Officers from the Berkut special police force, which had been dissolved by the government following the February revolution, took part in the seizure on the separatists' side. After having gained control of the Donetsk RSA and having declared the Donetsk People's Republic, pro-Russian groups vowed to fan out and take control of strategic infrastructure across Donetsk Oblast, and demanded that public officials who wished to continue their work swear allegiance to the Republic. By 14 April, pro-Russian militants led by former GRU operatives Igor Girkin and Igor Bezler had taken control of government buildings in many other cities within the oblast, including Sloviansk, Mariupol, Horlivka, Kramatorsk, Yenakiieve, Makiivka, Druzhkivka, and Zhdanivka. Following this seizure of the Donetsk RSA, the militants began to expand their control across the city. The municipal administration building was stormed and occupied by the insurgents on 16 April. Further actions by the separatists resulted in the capture of the offices of the regional state television network on 27 April. After capturing the broadcasting centre, the militants began to broadcast Russian television channels. On 4 May, the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic was raised over the police headquarters in Donetsk city proper. A number of interviews given in 2019‚Äì2020 by participants on the Russian side (including Girkin, Bezler, Gubarev and others) revealed that the initial idea to take control of Donbass towns was passed on to Donetsk \\"People's Governor\\" Pavel Gubarev by Sergey Glazyev, an advisor to Russian president Vladimir Putin at that time. Gubarev's team met Girkin's as it entered Ukraine from Russia, and the original plan was to capture Shakhtarsk first, as it was much closer to both the Russo-Ukrainian border and the Russian military base in Rostov-on-Don. The decision to attack Sloviansk instead was made after Girkin's group crossed the border, supposedly due to the presence of a larger group of pro-Russian activists ready to support their cause in the town. Military and financial support for the group was provided by Sergey Aksyonov and Konstantin Malofeev. Novaya Gazeta summarised the situation as \\"a group of poorly prepared mercenaries turning a whole region into a bloodbath\\" and concluded that Russia \\"will bear moral and political responsibility for its civilian casualties as long as its participants are not taken to court\\". In response to the widening unrest, the acting Ukrainian President, Oleksandr Turchynov, vowed to launch an \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" (ATO) against separatist movements in Donetsk Oblast. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, said on 9 April that the unrest in Donetsk Oblast would be resolved within 48 hours, either through negotiations or the use of force. President Oleksandr Turchynov signed a decree to retake the Donetsk RSA building, and place it \\"under state protection\\", and offered amnesty to the demonstrators if they laid down their arms. = Expansion of separatist territorial control =  Sloviansk  Pro-Russian insurgents occupying the Sloviansk city administration building, 14 April 2014 A group of masked pro-Russian militants under the command of a retired FSB officer Igor Girkin took control of the city administration building, police offices, and SBU building in Sloviansk, a city in the northern part of Donetsk Oblast, on 12 April. After militants took over the city, Sloviansk mayor Nelya Shtepa briefly appeared at an occupied police station, and expressed support for the militants. Others gathered outside the building, and similarly voiced their support for the militants. They told Ukrainian journalists who were reporting on the situation to \\"go back to Kyiv\\". Nelya Shtepa was later detained by the insurgents, and replaced by the self-proclaimed \\"people's mayor\\" Vyacheslav Ponomarev. The militants gained control of the city's police weapons cache and seized hundreds of firearms, which prompted the Ukrainian government to launch a \\"counter-terrorism\\" operation to retake the city. This government counter- offensive began on the morning of 13 April. As a result, an entrenched standoff between pro-Russian forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine ensued, marking the start of combat in Donbass. The city remained under siege until 5 July, when Ukrainian forces recaptured it, with an estimated 15,000‚Äì20,000 people displaced by the fighting. Mayor Shtepa was arrested on 11 July 2014 for allegedly colluding with pro-Russian forces. Shortly after taking control over Sloviansk, Girkin's group executed member of town council Volodymyr Ivanovych Rybak as well as four other citizens of Ukraine, including 25-years old Yuri Dyakovsky and 19-years old unnamed man. Girkin took responsibility for these executions in 2020, even though in the preceding years he and other pro-Russian militants claimed Rybak had been released from the custody.  Kramatorsk  In Kramatorsk, a city in northern Donetsk Oblast, separatists attacked a police station on 13 April, resulting in a shootout. The fighters, members of the Donbass People's Militia, later captured the police station. They removed the police station's sign and raised the flag of the Donetsk People's Republic over the building. They then issued an ultimatum that stated that if the city's mayor and administration did not swear allegiance to the Republic by the following Monday, they would remove them from office. Concurrently, a crowd of demonstrators surrounded the city administration building, captured it, and raised the Donetsk People's Republic flag over it. A representative of the Republic addressed locals outside the occupied police station, but was received negatively and booed. After a government counter- offensive as part of the \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" in Donetsk Oblast on 2‚Äì3 May, the insurgents were routed from Kramatorsk's occupied SBU building. Despite this, Ukrainian troops quickly withdrew from the city for unknown reasons, and the separatists quickly regained control. Sporadic fighting continued until 5 July, when the insurgents withdrew from Kramatorsk.  Horlivka  Militants attempted to seize the police headquarters in Horlivka on 12 April, but were halted. Ukrayinska Pravda reported that police said that the purpose of the attempted seizure was to gain access to a weapons cache. They said that they would use force if needed to defend the building from \\"criminals and terrorists\\". By 14 April, however, militants had captured the building after a tense standoff with the police. Some members of the local police unit had defected to the Donetsk People's Republic earlier in the day, whilst the remaining officers were forced to retreat, allowing the insurgents to take control of the building. The local chief of police was captured and badly beaten by the insurgents. A Horlivka city council deputy, Volodymyr Rybak, was kidnapped by masked men believed to be pro-Russian militants on 17 April. His body was later found in a river on 22 April. The city administration building was seized on 30 April, solidifying separatist control over Horlivka. Self-proclaimed mayor of Horlivka Volodymyr Kolosniuk was arrested by the SBU on suspicion of participation in \\"terrorist activities\\" on 2 July.

The Ukrainian government claimed to have \\"liberated\\" the building on 24 April, but this was denied by locals interviewed by the BBC near the building. Clashes between government forces and pro-Russian groups escalated in early May, when the city administration building was briefly retaken by the Ukrainian National Guard. The pro-Russian forces quickly took the building back. Militants then launched an attack on a local police station, leading the Ukrainian government to send in military forces. Skirmishes between the troops and local demonstrators caused the city administration building to be set on fire. Government forces, however, were unsuccessful in forcing out the pro-Russians, and only further inflamed tensions in Mariupol. On 16 May, however, Metinvest steelworkers, along with local police and security forces, routed the insurgents from the city administration and other occupied government buildings in the city. Most insurgents left the city, and those few remaining were said to be unarmed. Despite this, the headquarters of the Donetsk People's Republic in the city remained untouched, and pro-Russian demonstrators could still be seen outside the burnt city administration. Ukrainian troops gained control of the city on 13 June, with assistance from the National Guard. The headquarters of the DPR was captured. Mariupol was then declared the provisional capital of Donetsk Oblast, in place of Donetsk city, which was occupied by separatists.  Other cities  Many smaller cities across the Donbass fell to the separatists. In Artemivsk on 12 April, separatists failed to capture the local Ministry of Internal Affairs office, but instead captured the city administration building and raised the DPR flag over it.Unian, –°–µ–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç—ã –ø–æ–¥–Ω—è–ª–∏ —Å–≤–æ–π —Ñ–ª–∞–≥ –Ω–∞–¥ –≥–æ—Ä—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–º –ê—Ä—Ç–µ–º–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞ [Separatists have raised their flag over the Artemivsk city council building], 13 April 2014.

Police repelled an attack by pro-Russian militants upon an office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Krasnyi Lyman on 12 April, but the building was later captured by the separatists after a skirmish. Insurgents affiliated with the Donbass People's Militia occupied a regional administration building in Khartsyzk on 13 April, followed by a local administration building in Zhdanivka on 14 April. Demonstrators hoisted the flag of the DPR over the city administration buildings in Krasnoarmiisk and Novoazovsk on 16 April. The local administration building in Siversk was similarly captured on 18 April. Following the takeover, local police announced that they would co-operate with the activists. On 20 April, separatists in Yenakiieve left the city administration building there which they had occupied since 13 April. Despite this, by 27 May the city was still not under Ukrainian government control. Pro-Russian demonstrators in Kostiantynivka burnt down the offices of a newspaper that had been critical of the DPR on 22 April. 70 to 100 insurgents armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers attacked an armoury in Artemivsk on 24 April. The depot housed around 30 tanks. Ukrainian troops attempted to fight off the insurgents, but were forced to retreat after a substantial number of men were wounded by insurgent fire. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, said that the insurgents were led by a man with \\"an extensive beard\\", referring to the Russian militant Alexander Mozhaev. Some 30 militants seized the police headquarters in Konstantinovka on 28 April. On the next day, a city administration building in Pervomaisk was overrun by Luhansk People's Republic insurgents, who then raised their flag over it. On the same day, militants seized control over the city administration building in Alchevsk. In Krasnyi Luch, the city administration conceded to demands by separatist activists to support the referendums on the status of Donetsk and Luhansk being held on 11 May, and followed by raising the Russian flag over the city administration building. Insurgents occupied the city administration building in Stakhanov on 1 May. Later in the week, they captured the local police station, business centre, and SBU building. Activists in Rovenky occupied a police building on 5 May, but quickly left it. On the same day, the police headquarters in Slovianoserbsk was seized by members of the Army of the South-East, which is affiliated with the Luhansk People's Republic. The town of Antratsyt was occupied by a number of renegade Don Cossacks. Insurgents went on to seize the prosecutor's office in Sievierodonetsk on 7 May. On the next day, supporters of the Luhansk People's Republic captured government buildings in Starobilsk. = Government counter- offensive: the \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" = The barricade outside the Donetsk RSA, with a slogan that asks the EU and US to \\"go home\\", alluding to claims of a western intervention. Arsen Avakov, the Minister of Internal Affairs, said on 9 April that the separatist problem would be resolved within 48 hours, through either negotiations or the use of force. \\"There are two opposite ways for resolving this conflict ‚Äì a political dialogue and the heavy-handed approach. We are ready for both,\\" he said, according to the Ukrinform state news agency. At the time, President Oleksandr Turchynov had already signed a decree which called for the Donetsk Regional State Administration building, which had been occupied by separatists, to be taken \\"under state protection\\". He offered amnesty to any separatists who laid down their arms and surrendered.Novosti Donetsk, –¢—É—Ä—á–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤ –æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å —Å–µ–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ –±–µ–∑ –∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞–ª–∞, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –æ–Ω–∏ —Å–ª–æ–∂–∞—Ç –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ [Turchynov ready to release the separatists without charges, if they lay down their weapons], 10 April 2014.

In response to the spread of separatist control throughout Donetsk Oblast, and the refusal of the separatists to lay down their arms, Turchynov vowed to launch a military counter-offensive operation, called the \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\", against insurgents in the region on 15 April. As part of the counter-offensive, Ukrainian troops re-took the airfield in Kramatorsk after a skirmish with members of the Donbass People's Militia. At least four people died as a result. After the Armed Forces of Ukraine re-took the airfield, the commanding general of the unit that had retaken it, Vasyliy Krutov, was surrounded by hostile protesters who demanded to know why the Ukrainian troops had fired upon local residents. Krutov was then dragged back to the airbase along with his unit. They were then blocked by the protesters, who vowed not to let the troops leave the base. Krutov later told reporters that \\"if they [the separatists] do not lay down their arms, they will be destroyed\\". Donbass People's Militia insurgents entered Sloviansk on 16 April, along with six armoured personnel carriers they claimed to have obtained from the 25th Airborne Brigade, which had surrendered in the city of Kramatorsk.CBC, Ukraine crisis: combat vehicles with pro-Russian troops enter town, 16 April 2014. RIA Novosti, Six Ukrainian Army Vehicles Join Pro-Federalist Protesters in Kramatorsk, 16 April 2014. Reports say members of the brigade were disarmed after the vehicles were blocked from passing by angry locals. In another incident, several hundred residents of the village of Pchyolkino, south of Sloviansk, surrounded another column of 14 Ukrainian armoured vehicles. Following negotiations the troops were allowed to drive their vehicles away, but only after agreeing to surrender the magazines from their assault rifles. These incidents led President Turchynov to disband the 25th Airborne Brigade.UN Ukrainian News Agency, Turchynov Tells Defence Ministry Disestablish 25th Brigade of Air Assault Forces, 17 April 2014.

There was an attempted provocation but now it's over.\\" On the same day, Ukrainian government officials said that the Armed Forces had intended to retake the city of Sloviansk, but that an increased threat of \\"Russian invasion\\" halted these operations. Russian forces had mobilised within of the Ukrainian border. The officials said that seven troops were killed during the day's operations. President Turchynov issued a statement later in the day, and said that the \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" would be resumed, citing the ongoing hostage crisis in Sloviansk as a reason. By 6 May 14 Ukrainian troops had died and 66 had been injured in the fighting. Standoff between pro-Russian locals and Ukrainian forces in Mariupol, 9 May 2014 Early in the morning on 7 May, the National Guard retook the city administration in Mariupol after heavy fighting with insurgents overnight. Anti-government demonstrators said that government forces had used a \\"toxic gas\\" during the operation, resulting in injuries when the demonstrators tried to re-occupy the building after the National Guard withdrew. By 7 May, the flag of the DPR was once again flying over the building. Ukrainian troops launched another attack on insurgents in Mariupol on 9 May. During an assault on an occupied police building, that building was set alight by government forces, causing the insurgents to flee. Arsen Avakov said that 60 insurgents attacked the police building, not Ukrainian troops, and that the police and other government forces had managed to repel the insurgents. Between six and twenty militants were killed, along with one police officer. Four militants were captured, and five policemen were wounded. One armoured personnel carrier was captured by pro-Russian protesters during the fighting. After the clashes, pro-Russian forces built barricades across the city centre. Concurrently, Ukrainian National News said that separatists attempted to disarm Ukrainian troops near Donetsk. The troops resisted by firing warning shots, and arresting 100 of the separatists. Also, an unnamed Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) priest attempted to negotiate with separatists near Druzhkivka, but was later killed after being shot eight times. This was confirmed by the Church and the Prosecutor's Office. = May 2014: post-referendum fighting = referendum organised by pro-Russian separatists. A line to enter a polling place in Donetsk, 11 May 2014 Church of the Holy Epiphany in Karlivka on 23 May It was reported on 12 May that, following the local autonomy referendum, the Donbass People's Militia leader Igor Girkin declared himself \\"Supreme Commander\\" of the Donetsk People's Republic. In his decree, he demanded that all military stationed in the region swear an oath of allegiance to him within 48 hours, and said that all remaining Ukrainian military in the region would be \\"destroyed on the spot\\". He then petitioned the Russian Federation for military support to protect against \\"the threat of intervention by NATO\\" and \\"genocide\\". Pavel Gubarev, president of Donetsk People's Republic, instituted martial law on 15 May, and vowed for \\"total annihilation\\" of Ukrainian forces if they did not pull out of the Donbass by 21:00. Similarly, the president of the Luhansk People's Republic, Valery Bolotov, declared martial law on 22 May. The Donetsk-based steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov called on his 300,000 employees within the Donetsk region to \\"rally against separatists\\" on 20 May. Sirens sounded at noon at his factories to signal the beginning of the rally.

Three army infantry combat vehicles and one lorry were destroyed, and another three armoured vehicles were captured by the insurgents. The Internal Affairs Ministry stated that some insurgents had attempted to enter Luhansk Oblast from Russia, but had been repelled by border guards. Following a declaration by Pavel Gubarev establishing the \\"New Russia Party\\" on 22 May, representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk republics signed an agreement creating the confederative state of New Russia. Separatists planned to incorporate most of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions into the new confederation, including the key cities of Kharkiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhia and Odessa.

Separatist barricade in Luhansk city A unit of the pro-government Donbas Battalion volunteer paramilitary attempted to advance on a separatist checkpoint near the village of Karlivka, northwest of Donetsk city, on 23 May. They were ambushed by a group of between 150 and 200 separatists, supported by one of the captured armoured personnel carriers. The pro-government paramilitary was surrounded by the separatists, and outnumbered six to one, until fighters affiliated with the nationalist Right Sector broke through the separatist lines to allow some members of the group to escape. Five members of the Donbas Battalion were killed, along with four separatists. Twenty members of the pro-government paramilitaries were wounded, and at least four were captured. The involvement of Right Sector was disputed by the leadership of the Donbas Battalion. Pro-Russian leader Igor Bezler said that he executed all of the captured paramilitaries. Another separatist leader confirmed four of their fighters were killed, and also said that ten pro- government paramilitaries and two civilians died. During the same day, two pro-Russian separatists were killed during an assault by the pro-government \\"Ukraine Battalion\\" paramilitary on an occupied local government building in Torez.  Airport battle and fighting in Luhansk  On the morning of 26 May 200 pro-Russian insurgents, including members of the Vostok Battalion, captured the main terminal of the Donetsk International Airport, erected roadblocks around it, and demanded that government forces withdraw. Soon after these demands were issued, the Ukrainian National Guard issued an ultimatum to the separatists, asking them to surrender. This was subsequently rejected. Government forces then launched an assault on separatist positions at the airport with paratroopers and airstrikes. Attack helicopters were also used by government forces. They targeted a separatist-operated anti-aircraft gun. An estimated 40 insurgents died in the fighting, with some civilians caught in the crossfire. Between 15 and 35 insurgents were killed in a single incident, when two lorries carrying wounded fighters away from airport were destroyed in an ambush by government forces. During the fighting at the airport, Druzhba Arena in Donetsk city was ransacked by pro-Russian insurgents, who looted the building and destroyed surveillance equipment, and set it ablaze. Concurrently, Donetsk police said the insurgents had killed two policemen in the nearby town of Horlivka. The Moscow Times reported that the two men had been executed for \\"breaking their oath to the Donetsk People's Republic\\". Luhansk People's Republic-affiliated insurgents attacked a Ukrainian National Guard unit in the early hours of 28 May. RIA Novosti reported that 80 National Guard members subsequently surrendered to the insurgents, whilst the National Guard issued a statement that said \\"there have been losses both in the ranks of the military unit and the attacking side\\". At least one separatist and one soldier died in the fighting. = Escalation in May and June 2014 = Mykhailo Koval, the Minister of Defence, said on 30 May that Ukrainian government forces had \\"completely cleared\\" the insurgents from the southern and western parts of Donetsk Oblast and the northern part of Luhansk Oblast.

Luhansk border post siege  Two separatists were killed in a skirmish with Ukrainian border guards on 31 May. Two days later, five separatists were killed when 500 separatists attacked a border post in Luhansk Oblast. Eleven border guards and eight separatists were wounded during the fighting, which also killed one civilian.  2 June Luhansk airstrike  On 2 June, eight people were killed and more than 20 wounded by a series of explosions hitting the occupied RSA building in Luhansk city. Separatists blamed the incident on a government airstrike, while Ukrainian officials denied this, and claimed that the explosions were caused by a stray surface- to-air missile fired by insurgents. The Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe (OSCE) published a report on the next day, stating that based on \\"limited observation\\", they believed that the explosion was caused by an airstrike, supporting separatist claims. A CNN investigation found clear evidence that the attack came from the air and the pattern of the craters suggested use of standard equipment on the Su-25, a ground-attack fighter, and the Su-27 ‚Äì both combat aircraft operated by Ukraine. Analysis of Radio Liberty also concluded that \\"Despite Denials, All Evidence For Deadly Explosion Points To Kyiv\\". CNN believed that it was the first time that civilians had been killed in an attack by the Ukrainian air force during the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Donbass. The next day, Luhansk People's Republic declared a three-day mourning in the city. Continued fighting Vostok Battalion members dismantling the barricade at Donetsk RSA on 3 June Government forces destroyed a separatist stronghold in Semenivka, and regained control of Krasnyi Lyman on 3 June. Two soldiers were killed in the fighting, and forty-five were wounded.

They said that at least 25 were killed while in hospital at Krasnyi Lyman. None of these reports were independently confirmed, and both sides denied the other's accounts of the battle. On the next day, insurgents captured the besieged Luhansk border post, as well as a National Guard base near Luhansk city. The fighting in these areas left six insurgents dead, and three government soldiers wounded. Another border post was captured by the insurgents in Sverdlovsk. The National Guard base fell after guardsmen ran out of ammunition. Separatists had earlier seized vast quantities of munitions from the captured border post. Another border post was attacked on 5 June, in the village of Marynivka. Government officials said that between 15 and 16 insurgents were killed and that 5 soldiers were injured as well. A shootout between rival separatist groups in Donetsk city took place on 7 June, near the Donetsk RSA. The vice-president of the Donetsk People's Republic, Maxim Petrukhin, was killed in the fighting, and president Denis Pushilin was wounded.  Russian tank incursion  Ukrainian officials said that Russia had allowed tanks to cross the Russo- Ukrainian border into Donetsk Oblast on 11 June. Internal Affairs Minister Arsen Avakov said \\"we have observed columns passing with armoured personnel carriers, other armoured vehicles and artillery pieces, and tanks which, according to our information, came across the border and this morning were in Snizhne\\". He continued by saying Ukrainian forces had destroyed part of the column, and that fighting was still under way. Reuters correspondents confirmed the presence of three tanks in Donetsk city, and the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research also said that Russia had indeed sent tanks, along with other heavy weapons, to the separatists in Ukraine. The weapons sent are said to include: a column of three T-64 tanks, several BM-21 Grad multiple rocket launchers, and other military vehicles. \\"Russia will claim these tanks were taken from Ukrainian forces, but no Ukrainian tank units have been operating in that area,\\" the State Department said in a statement. \\"We are confident that these tanks came from Russia.\\" The newly elected Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, said that it was \\"unacceptable\\" for tanks to be crossing into Ukraine. Russia called the reports \\"another fake piece of information.\\" Nevertheless, the three tanks were later spotted moving through Makiivka and Torez, flying the flag of the Russian Federation. Insurgents confirmed that they had obtained three tanks, but leaders refused to elaborate on how they acquired them; one militant told reporters that they originated \\"from a military warehouse\\". The president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, stated that the three tanks would be stationed in Donetsk city, and that they gave his forces \\"at least some hope of defending [Donetsk] because heavy weapons are already being used against us.\\"Ukraine crisis: Kiev forces win back Mariupol, BBC News (13 June 2014) Konstantin Mashovets, a former Ukrainian Defence Ministry official, said the tanks had likely been seized by Russian forces in Crimea before making their way into mainland Ukraine. Anton Heraschenko, an advisor to Arsen Avakov, confirmed at a briefing in Kyiv that the tanks were once in the possession of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in Crimea, and that they had been transferred by sea to Russia before crossing the border into Ukraine. BTR-80 in Ukrainian service, 12 June 2014 On the day after the tank incursion, three soldiers were killed when they were ambushed by insurgents in Stepanivka. Heavy fighting resumed during the morning of 13 June, when the government launched a new attack against insurgents in Mariupol. Ukrainian troops managed to recapture the city, and declared it the \\"provisional capital\\" of Donetsk Oblast until the government regains control over Donetsk city. Meanwhile, an agreement between the Minister of Internal Affairs, Arsen Avakov, and the president of the DPR, Denis Pushilin, meant to create a ceasefire and allow civilians to escape the violence in Sloviansk failed, with both sides blaming each other for launching new attacks.Ukrainian interior minister blames 'militia' for ceasefire talks' failure, Interfax-Ukraine (12 June 2014) During the next morning, a convoy of border guardsmen was attacked by insurgents while passing Mariupol, leaving at least five of the guardsmen dead.  Ilyushin Il-76 shoot-down  A Ukrainian Air Force Ilyushin Il-76MD was shot down by forces aligned with the Luhansk People's Republic on 14 June. The aircraft was preparing to land at Luhansk International Airport, and was carrying troops and equipment from an undisclosed location. All 49 people on board died. Meanwhile, two T-72 tanks entered Donetsk, and a skirmish erupted at a military checkpoint in Luhansk, lasting two days.  Battle of Yampil  Late on 19 June, a battle fought with tanks and armoured vehicles broke out in town of Yampil, near government- held Krasnyi Lyman. Up to 4,000 insurgents were present for the fighting, which started, according to the insurgents, after the Armed Forces attempted to capture insurgent-held Yampil, with the goal of breaking through to Siversk. According to the Armed Forces, it started after insurgents attempted to break through a cordon of government troops around government-held Krasny Lyman. The battle was described as exceeding \\"in terms of force and scale anything there has been\\" during the conflict in Donbass. The Armed Forces deployed both air and artillery strikes in their attempts to rout the insurgents. The battle continued into the next day. Overnight, between 7 and 12 soldiers were killed and between 25 and 30 were wounded. The Armed Forces said they killed 300 insurgents, but this was not independently verified, the separatists confirmed only two deaths and seven wounded on their side. The insurgents also said they destroyed one tank, several BMD-1s, and also shot down a Su-25 bomber.–ù–∞–¥ –ø–æ—Å–µ–ª–∫–æ–º –Ø–º–ø–æ–ª—å —Å–±–∏—Ç —Å–∞–º–æ–ª–µ—Ç –°—É-25 ‚Äì –æ–ø–æ–ª—á–µ–Ω—Ü—ã (Su-25 shot down above the village of Yampil ‚Äì militia) RIA Novosti. 20 June 2014.

RIA Novosti, 20 June 2014 = July 2014: post-ceasefire government offensive = After a week-long ceasefire unilaterally declared by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko ended, the Armed Forces renewed their operations against the insurgents on 1 July. Shelling occurred in Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, and government forces retook a border crossing in Dolzhansk, one of the three major border crossings occupied by the separatists. Government forces also recaptured the villages of Brusivka and Stary Karavan. On the same day, insurgents in Luhansk said that they had taken control of Luhansk International Airport. On 1 July 2014 in Donetsk a street gun fight broke between rival factions of pro-Russian militants, which resulted in one person being fatally wounded and two others in critical conditions.Strange war in Donetsk ‚Äì how DNR battalions fought against DNR militants. 62 (Donetsk city portal). 2 July 2014 Internal Affairs Ministry spokesman Zoryan Shkyriak said that over 1,000 pro-Russian insurgents were killed in the first day following the resumption of hostilities. Liga.net, citing a source involved with the government military operation, reported that over 400 insurgents were killed in action, but that the higher figures reported earlier could not be confirmed. Separatists themselves reported only two deaths in fighting at Mykolaivka. Damaged block of flats in Donetsk, 14 July 2014 Insurgents attacked a border post in Novoazovsk on 2 July. During the attack, mortars were fired upon the post, and clashes broke out. One border guard was killed in the fighting, and another eight guardsmen were injured. Government forces recaptured the town of Mykolaivka, near Sloviansk, on 4 July. A group of DPR- affiliated militants defected as a result, and joined the Ukrainian army. In a further blow to the insurgents, government forces retook the stronghold of Sloviansk on 5 July. Commander of the DPR insurgents, Igor Girkin, took the decision \\"due to the overwhelming numerical superiority of the enemy\\", according to DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai. He said that DPR forces had retreated to Kramatorsk, but BBC News reported that they were seen abandoning their checkpoints in Kramatorsk. Later that day, Borodai confirmed that the insurgents had abandoned \\"the entire northern sector\\", including Kramatorsk, and had retreated to Donetsk city. After the retreat of Girkin's forces to Donetsk, he assumed control of the DPR, replacing the previous authorities there in what was described as a \\"coup d'√©tat\\". Subsequently, Ukraine's Armed Forces recaptured Druzhkivka, Kostyantynivka, and Artemivsk. Amidst the insurgent retreat, Donetsk city mayor Oleksandr Lukyanchenko said that at least 30,000 people had left the city since April. In a separate development, Ukrainian forces said they spotted two aerial drones in Mariupol, and shot one of them down. Ahead of a planned government offensive on the insurgent- occupied city of Donetsk, key roads leading into the city were blocked on 7 July. Insurgents destroyed railway bridges over the roads, causing them to collapse and block the roads. Defence Minister Valeriy Heletey stated on 8 July that there would be \\"no more unilateral ceasefires\\", and said dialogue was only possible if the insurgents laid down their weapons. More fighting broke out at Luhansk International Airport on 9 July. LPR-affiliated insurgents said that they had captured the airport on 1 July, but the Ukrainian army managed to maintain control over it. More than 10,000 households in Luhansk Oblast are without gas service due to damage to gas lines, according to a statement on the same day by the regional gas supplier. Destroyed house in Donbass, July 2014 Clashes at the Donetsk International Airport continued on 10 July. Insurgents fired mortars at the airport, and attempted to recapture it, but were repelled by the Armed Forces. Ukrainian forces also retook the city of Siversk, which was confirmed by the insurgents. On the same day, the Luhansk city administration reported that six civilians had been injured due to ongoing hostilities across the city. There were also reports of factionalism among the separatists, with some desertions. According to these reports, the Vostok Battalion had rejected the authority of Igor Girkin. Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the DPR, denied these reports, however, and said that they were lies. Heavy fighting continued in Luhansk Oblast on 11 July. On that day, an Armed Forces column travelling near Rovenky was attacked by an insurgent-operated Grad rocket lorry. An air strike launched by the Armed Forces eventually managed to destroy the rocket launcher, but only after 23 soldiers were killed. In response to the attack, Ukrainian president Poroshenko said that \\"For every life of our soldiers, the militants will pay with tens and hundreds of their own\\". On the next day, the Ukrainian Air Force launched air strikes targeting insurgent positions across Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. The Ukrainian government said that 500 insurgents were killed in these strikes, which they said were retaliations for the separatist rocket attack on the previous day. Four people were killed at Marinka, a western suburb of Donetsk city, after rockets struck an insurgent- held area of the city. The Ukrainian government and separatists blamed each other for the attack. = Fighting worsens in eastern Donetsk Oblast = After a brief lull following the insurgent withdrawal from the northern part of Donetsk Oblast, fighting continued to escalate sharply in the eastern parts of Donetsk Oblast. Shells landed on the border town of Donetsk in Rostov Oblast, a part of Russia, on 13 July. One civilian was killed in the shelling. Russian officials blamed the Armed Forces of Ukraine for the shelling, whilst Ukraine denied responsibility and accused insurgents in Donbass of having staged a false flag attack. Russia said it was considering launching airstrikes against government targets in Ukraine as retaliation for the shelling. Ukrainian forces went on to make gains around Luhansk, ending an insurgent blockade of Luhansk International Airport. LPR officials acknowledged that they lost 30 men during fighting in the village of Oleksandrivka. The insurgent-occupied town of Snizhne was hit by rockets fired from an aeroplane on 15 July, leaving at least 11 people dead, and destroying multiple homes. The insurgents blamed the Air Force of Ukraine, but the Ukrainian government denied any involvement in the attack. Clashes broke out between insurgents and the Armed Forces along the border with Russia in Shakhtarsk Raion on 16 July. Insurgents who had been holed up in the town of Stepanivka made an attempt to escape encirclement by government forces at 05:00. According to a report by the National Guard, a roadblock near the border village of Marynivka was attacked by the insurgents with tanks, mortar fire, and anti-tank missiles. The checkpoint was shelled for over an hour, causing significant damage to infrastructure in Marynivka. Guardsmen managed to repel the attack, and forced the insurgents back to Stepanivka, where fighting continued. The battle then moved to the nearby village of Tarany. At least 11 Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting. Attempts to form a \\"contact group\\" between the insurgents and the Ukrainian government, part of President Poroshenko's \\"15-point peace plan\\", failed, leaving little hope of a renewed ceasefire. The insurgents later said that they successfully retook Marynivka from the Armed Forces. = Downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 = A civilian passenger jet, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, was shot down over Hrabove on 17 July, killing all 298 people on board. DPR-affiliated insurgents blamed the Ukrainian government for the disaster, whereas the government, Netherlands, and Australia blamed Russia and the insurgents. The responsibility for investigation was delegated to the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) and the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT), who concluded that the airliner was downed by a Buk surface-to-air missile launched from pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory in Ukraine. According to the JIT, the Buk that was used originated from the 53rd Anti- Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation, and had been transported from Russia on the day of the crash, fired from a field in a separatist- controlled area, and the launcher returned to Russia after it was used to shoot down MH17. On the basis of the JIT's conclusions, the governments of the Netherlands and Australia hold Russia responsible for the deployment of the Buk installation and are taking steps to hold Russia formally accountable. This disaster followed two similar incidents earlier in the week, when two Ukrainian Air Force planes were shot down. Meanwhile, fighting in Luhansk resulted in the loss of electrical power and water services across the city. Shelling damaged an electrical substation in the district Kamennobrodskiy, causing the power loss. An oil refinery in Lysychansk was also set alight. At least 20 civilians were killed in the shelling of Luhansk, according to a statement by the city administration. The statement said that a barrage of rockets hit \\"virtually every district\\". The shelling forced OSCE monitors to flee from their office in Luhansk, and move to Starobilsk. Government forces went on to capture the south-eastern section of the city. Another 16 people died overnight, and at least 60 were wounded. According to a government report, Luhansk airport was secured by government forces amidst the battle. = Government push into Donetsk and Luhansk cities = Damaged tower block in Lysychansk, 28 July 2014 Heavy fighting also resumed around Donetsk airport overnight, and explosions were heard in all districts of the city. The city fell quiet by 09:00 on 19 July. By 21 July, heavy fighting in Donetsk had begun again. Donetsk was rocked by explosions, and heavy weapons fire caused smoke to rise over the city. Fighting was concentrated in the northwestern districts of Kyivskyi and Kuibyshevskyi, and also near the central railway station and airport, leading local residents to seek refuge in bomb shelters, or to flee the city. The city's water supply was cut off during the fighting, and all railway and bus service was stopped. The streets emptied, and insurgents erected barricades across the city to control traffic. The cities of Dzerzhynsk, Soledar, and Rubizhne were also recaptured by government forces. The suburb of Mayorsk, just outside Horlivka, and the city of Sievierodonetsk, in Luhansk Oblast, were recaptured by the Armed Forces on 22 July. OSCE monitors visiting Donetsk following the previous day's fighting there said that the city was \\"practically deserted\\", and that the fighting had stopped. On the same day, DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai said that he wanted to resume ceasefire talks. DPR commander Igor Girkin also said \\"The time has come when Russia must take a final decision ‚Äì to really support Donbas's Russians or abandon them forever\\".Ukraine Army Hits Rebels With Advance ‚ÄòAcross All Fronts‚Äô, Bloomberg News (21 July 2014) Also, the pro- Ukrainian paramilitary Donbas Battalion captured Popasna. Destroyed railway flyover, 25 July 2014 After having retaken Sievierodonetsk, government forces fought insurgents around the neighbouring city of Lysychansk. An insurgent car bomb killed three soldiers during the fighting there. Grad rocket attacks were launched against government forces garrisoned at Vesela Hora, Kamysheve, and also Luhansk airport. The press centre for the government military operation said that situation remained \\"most complex\\" in the areas around \\"Donetsk city, Luhansk city, Krasnodon and Popasna\\". Government forces broke through the insurgent blockade around Donetsk airport on 23 July, and then advanced into the northwestern corner of Donetsk city. Subsequently, the insurgents withdrew from many areas on the outskirts of the city, including Karlivka, , , and the area around Donetsk airport. Insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that this was done to fortify Donetsk city centre, and also to avoid being encircled by government forces. He also said that he did not expect a government incursion into Donetsk city centre. Meanwhile, clashes continued in Shakhtarsk Raion, along the border with Russia. Amidst the fighting, two Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jets that had been providing air support to ground forces near Dmytrivka were shot down by the insurgents. By the next day, government forces recaptured Lysychansk. On the same day, fighting raged around Horlivka. Government forces launched air and artillery strikes on insurgents within the city, and clashes were fought all around it. One important bridge collapsed in the fighting, severing a critical route out of the city. People fled the violence in cars and on foot. Despite these advances by the Armed Forces, the border with Russia was not secured. Izvaryne border post in Luhansk Oblast, which is controlled by the Army of the South-East, was reported to be the main entry point for weapons and reinforcements from Russia. Shelling began again in the Kyivskyi, Kirovskyi and Petrovskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to Donetsk city administration, 11 houses were damaged in Petrovsky, and at least one man was injured. The fighting continued overnight into 26 July, with explosions, shelling, and shooting heard across the city. During the third day of the government's offensive on the insurgent-stronghold of Horlivka, between 20 and 30 civilians were killed on 27 July. Horlivka was virtually abandoned, with electric power and water cut off. Shelling damaged or destroyed many buildings, including a hospital, greengrocer's, and energy company office. Ukrainian troops also entered the town of Shakhtarsk, fought the insurgents that had been occupying it, and captured it around 14:30. This cut off the supply corridor between the territories held by the DPR and LPR, isolating insurgents in Donetsk city. Skirmishes also broke out in the nearby towns of Snizhne and Torez. The intense combat across Shakhtarsk Raion forced a party of Dutch and Australian policemen to call off an attempt to investigate the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. 41 Ukrainian soldiers deserted their posts and went to the insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing, where they told insurgents that they refused to fight against their \\"own people\\". The insurgents allowed them to flee Ukraine, and cross into Russia. By 28 July, the strategic heights of Savur-Mohyla were under Ukrainian control, along with the town of Debaltseve. Insurgents had previously used Savur-Mohyla to shell Ukrainian troops around the town of Marynivka. By 29 July, a further 17 civilians had been killed in the fighting, along with an additional 43 people injured. Shelling continued in the Leninskyi and Kyivskyi districts of Donetsk city. According to the city administration, these districts were heavily damaged. According to a report by National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, crossing points on the border with Russia were attacked from Russian territory at least 153 times since 5 June. 27 border guardsmen were killed in these attacks, and 185 were injured. Government forces made a further advance on 30 July, when they evicted insurgents from Avdiivka, near Donetsk airport. Military operations were paused on 31 July. This was meant to allow international experts to examine the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which is located in Shakhtarsk Raion, where the fiercest battles had been taking place on the previous few days. Monitors were escorted to the site by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. After fighting severed various transmission lines, Luhansk city lost all access to electrical power. Little fuel remained to power emergency generators. Minor skirmishes occurred in Vasylivka and Zhovtneve. Meanwhile, talks between the separatists, Russia, Ukraine, and the OSCE were held in Minsk. Fighting continued in Shakhtarsk. An ambush by the insurgents on government forces there resulted in the deaths of ten soldiers. 11 went missing, and 13 were wounded. A government offensive on the city of Pervomaisk in Luhansk Oblast continued. Damaged building in Snizhne, 6 August 2014 Following a series of military defeats, Igor Girkin, insurgent commander for the DPR, urged Russian military intervention, and said that the combat inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties amongst the local population in Donetsk Oblast had caused the setbacks. He addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying that \\"Losing this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power of the president\\". Government forces closed in on Luhansk and Donetsk cities on 3 August. A number of civilians were killed in fighting in both cities. Luhansk was reported to be \\"virtually surrounded\\", with little electrical power or water supply available. The situation in the city of Donetsk was less dire, as trains to Russia were still running, but fighting and shelling did not relent. According to the Armed Forces, three-quarters of the territory once held by the insurgents had been recaptured. They also said that they had completely cut off supply lines between the DPR and LPR, after more than a week of fighting in Shakhtarsk Raion. After a prolonged battle, the Armed Forces recaptured the vital town of Yasynuvata on 4 August. At least five soldiers died in the fighting to capture the town, which is a strategic railway junction on the main road between Donetsk and Luhansk cities. The pro- government paramilitary Azov and Shakhtarsk battalions said that they had advanced into Donetsk city, and had begun to \\"liberate\\" it. The Ukrainian government said that all civilians should evacuate from Donetsk, and issued statements asking DPR and LPR forces to help establish \\"humanitarian corridors\\" to allow civilians in Donetsk, Luhansk and Horlivka to flee. Commenting on the situation in Luhansk, mayor Sergei Kravchenko said \\"As a result of the blockade and ceaseless rocket attacks, the city is on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe\\". As government troops pushed into Donetsk on 5 August, heavy fighting erupted at 17:00 in the Petrovskyi district of the city. Elsewhere, insurgents recaptured the town of Yasynuvata after a retreat by government forces. A spokesman from the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that the Armed Forces left the town to avoid harming the \\"peaceful population\\", and that the city was being evacuated so that it could be \\"completely liberated\\". He also said that the railway station remained under government control, and that all railway traffic had been blocked. Fighting between insurgents and government forces across the Donbass region continued \\"constantly\\" over the course of the day. Burning block of flats in Shakhtarsk, 3 August 2014 Fighting and shelling continued around Donetsk on 8 August, with several civilians killed or injured. By 9 August, insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that Donetsk had been \\"completely encircled\\" by government forces. This followed the capture of the vital town of Krasnyi Luch by the government, after insurgent-aligned Cossacks stationed there fled. Further skirmishes between insurgents and the Armed Forces took place in Mnohopillia, Stepanivka, Hryhorivka, Krasny Yar, Pobeda, Shyshkove, Komyshne, Novohannivka, Krasna Talivka, Dmytrivka, Sabivka, and Luhansk airport. Overnight and into 10 August, government forces launched an artillery barrage on Donetsk city, causing \\"massive damage\\" across it. According to a spokesman for the Armed Forces, insurgents began to flee the city during the barrage, and were in a state of \\"panic and chaos\\". Hospitals and residential buildings were heavily damaged, and many remaining residents took shelter in basements. The cities of Pervomaisk, Kalynove, Komyshuvakha, in western Luhansk Oblast near Popasna, were captured by government forces on 12 August after heavy fighting. Heavy shelling of Donetsk continued into 14 August. During this artillery barrage, Igor Girkin resigned from his post as commander of the insurgent forces of the Donetsk People's Republic. He was replaced by Vladimir Kononov, who is known by the nom de guerre Tsar. Girkin's resignation, along with the 7 August resignation of DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai (who was replaced by Alexander Zakharchenko), represented a shift in the nature of the conflict. Given the recent military failings of the DPR and the LPR, Russia decided that it could no longer rely on a patchwork of irregular fighters in the Donbass, and ordered a change in leadership. It abandoned the separatist project, and replaced it with the idea of federalisation of Donbass within Ukraine. To effect this change, it would soon switch gears from hybrid warfare to conventional warfare. Later in the day on 14 August, a convoy of some two dozen armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles with official Russian military plates crossed into Ukraine near the insurgent-controlled Izvaryne border crossing. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen confirmed that a \\"Russian incursion\\" into Ukraine had occurred. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that Ukrainian artillery engaged and destroyed a \\"significant\\" portion of the armoured column. The Russian Defence Ministry denied the existence of any such convoy. Following this incident, the newly appointed prime minister of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko said that his forces included 1,200 Russian-trained combatants. Damaged building in Donetsk, 7 August 2014 A Ukrainian Air Force MiG-29 fighter jet was shot down by the insurgents in Luhansk Oblast on 17 August. Ten civilians were killed during continued shelling in Donetsk. The insurgent-occupied city of Horlivka was encircled by the Armed Forces on 18 August. Government forces also advanced into the edges of Luhansk city. A convoy of refugees from Luhansk was hit by Grad rockets near the village of Novosvitlivka. Dozens of civilians died in the attack, which the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine blamed on the insurgents. Insurgents denied attacking any refugee convoys. DPR prime minister Aleksandr Zakharchenko stated that if the Ukrainian government made \\"reasonable proposals to lay down arms, close borders, we will talk on equal terms as equal partners\\". He added, however, that the government \\"must recognise us as a state, now it is already impossible to ask for a certain degree of autonomy\\".Donetsk Republic prime minister says militia ready for reasonable talks with Kiev, Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (19 August 2014) After having edged into Luhansk city on 18 August, government forces began to advance through the city \\"block by block\\" on 19 August. Fighting was heard in streets across the city, and shelling of many insurgent-occupied districts continued. There was also fighting Makiivka and Ilovaisk, two cities just outside Donetsk city. A spokesman for the Internal Affairs Ministry said that government forces were \\"clearing\\" Ilovaisk of insurgents, and later captured most of the city. The headquarters of the DPR in Donetsk city were also shelled. Fighting across Donetsk Oblast on 19 August resulted in the deaths of 34 civilians. By early evening on 20 August, government forces said that they had recaptured \\"significant parts\\" of the city of Luhansk, after a series of running battles in streets throughout the day. = August 2014 invasion by Russian forces = Ukrainian troops guarding a road in Donbass By 25 August, an insurgent counter-offensive had stalled the government's offensive on Donetsk and Luhansk cities. Insurgents attacked government positions in Shchastya, and along the Siverskyi Donets River in Luhansk Oblast. As this attack occurred, insurgents in Luhansk received reinforcements. Government forces near Ilovaisk and Amvrosiivka in Donetsk Oblast became surrounded by insurgents, after their attempt to take Ilovaisk was halted by heavy shelling. The pro-government volunteer Donbas Battalion, trapped in the city for days by the insurgents, accused the Ukrainian government and Armed Forces of \\"abandoning\\" them. Other volunteer battalions, such as the Azov and Dnipro, left Ilovaisk after encountering heavy resistance. Donbas Battalion leader Semen Semenchenko said \\"I think it is profitable for the defence ministry not to send help, but to achieve a situation where volunteer battalions start blaming each other about who helped who\\". DPR forces stated their intention to \\"fight their way to the Azov Sea\\" on 23 August. In line with this statement, an artillery barrage rained down on the coastal city of Novoazovsk, in southern Donetsk Oblast. A column of armoured vehicles crossed into Ukraine from Russia near Novoazovsk on 25 August. There were no insurgent formations within of this area for many weeks. Heavy fighting took place in the village of Markyne, from Novoazovsk. Insurgents used the village as a base to shell Novoazovsk. A spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine said that the entrance of the column into Ukraine was an attempt \\"by the Russian military in the guise of Donbass fighters to open a new area of military confrontation\\". According to the Mariupol city website, the Dnipro and Donbas battalions repelled the attack, and the \\"invaders\\" retreated to the border. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had no knowledge of the incident, and suggested that reports of the incident being an incursion by Russian forces were \\"disinformation.\\" Directly prior to the appearance of the column, the area was heavily shelled. The nearest insurgent artillery positions were beyond the range of this area. Villagers from Kolosky in Starobesheve Raion told Reuters that military men with Russian accents and no identifying insignias had appeared in the village at the weekend of 23‚Äì24 August. They set up a roadblock near the village. The men wore distinctive white armbands. The villagers referred to them as \\"polite green men\\", a term that was used to refer to the irregular Russian forces that took control of Crimea from February 2014. Following the appearance of these men, ten soldiers in green military uniforms with white armbands were detained by Ukrainian forces at Dzerkalne. This village is north of Novoazovosk, from Kolosky, and about from the Russian border. The Russian military confirmed that these men were indeed Russian paratroopers, and that they had been captured. The Russian Defence Ministry said the men had entered Ukraine \\"by mistake during an exercise\\". The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) released videos that they said were interviews with the captive Russian soldiers. In one of the videos, a soldier said that their commanders had sent them on a march \\"without explaining its purpose or warning that they would be in Ukrainian territory, where they were apprehended by Ukrainian forces and surrendered without a fight\\". People queueing for water in Donetsk, 22 August 2014 Insurgents pushed into Novoazovsk on 27 August. Whilst the Ukrainian government said they were in \\"total control\\" of Novoazovsk, town mayor Oleg Sidorkin confirmed that the insurgents had captured it. He also said that \\"dozens\\" of tanks and armoured vehicles had been used by the insurgents in their assault on the town. At least four civilians were injured by insurgent shelling. To the north, close to Starobesheve, Ukrainian forces said that they spotted a column of 100 armoured vehicles, tanks, and Grad rocket lorries that was heading south, toward Novoazovsk. They said these vehicles were marked with \\"white circles or triangles\\", similar to the white armbands seen on the captured Russian paratroopers earlier in the week. Amidst pressure on this new third front, government forces retreated westward toward Mariupol. They evacuated the town of Starobesheve, among other areas in the stretch of borderland from the Sea of Azov to the existing insurgent-held territories. A report by The New York Times described the retreating soldiers as \\"exhausted, filthy and dismayed\\". Western officials described the new insurgent actions as a \\"stealth invasion\\" by the Russian Federation, with tanks, artillery and infantry said to have crossed into Ukraine from Russian territory. US State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said that \\"these incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway\\", and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said \\"An invasion of Russian forces has taken place\\". A statement by the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine (NSDC) later said that Novoazovsk had been captured by \\"Russian troops\\", despite earlier denials by the Ukrainian government. According to the NSDC, Ukrainian troops withdrew from Novoazovsk to save lives, and were instead preparing defences in Mariupol. Meanwhile, fighting continued in and around Donetsk city. Shells fell on the Kalininskyi district of Donetsk, and the Donbas Battalion continued to fight against the insurgents that had trapped them in Ilovaisk for days. NATO commander Brig. Gen. Nico Tak said on 28 August that \\"well over\\" 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating in the Donbass conflict zone. Amidst what The New York Times described as \\"chaos\\" in the conflict zone, the insurgents re-captured Savur- Mohyla. Despite these advances by pro-Russian forces, the National Guard of Ukraine temporarily retook the city of Komsomolske in Starobesheve Raion of Donetsk Oblast on 29 August. However, two days later, Ukrainian forces retreated from the city, and Komsomolske was once again taken by the DPR forces. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces retreated from Novosvitlivka after being attacked by what they said were \\"Russian tanks\\". They said that every house in the village was destroyed. The trapped Donbas Battalion withdrew from Ilovaisk on 30 August after negotiating an agreement with pro-Russian forces. According to some of the troops who withdrew from Ilovaisk, DPR forces violated the agreement and fired on them whilst they retreated under white flags, killing as many as several dozen. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk awarding Donbas Battalion volunteers, 1 September 2014 A Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov was hit by shore-based artillery fire on 31 August. Eight sailors were rescued from the sinking boat, whilst two crew-members were missing. Former insurgent commander Igor Girkin said that the insurgents had \\"dealt the enemy their first naval defeat\\". Government forces withdrew from Luhansk International Airport on 1 September, despite having held the airport from insurgent attacks for weeks prior. The airport saw fierce fighting on the night before the withdrawal, and Ukrainian officials said that their forces at the airport had been attacked by a column of Russian tanks. Clashes also continued at Donetsk International Airport. Heavy fighting was observed by OSCE monitors near the villages of Shyrokyne and Bezimenne on 4 September. Respectively, these villages are and east of Mariupol. Ukrainian officials in Mariupol said that the situation there \\"was worsening by the hour\\", and that there was an imminent danger of an attack on the city. DPR forces came within of the city on 4 September, but their advance was repulsed by an overnight counter-attack launched by the Armed Forces and the Azov Battalion. They were driven back about east of the city. Constant shelling was heard on the outskirts of Mariupol. = September 2014 ceasefire = A funeral service for a Ukrainian soldier, 11 September 2014 After days of peace talks in Minsk under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Ukraine, Russia, the DPR, and the LPR agreed to a ceasefire on 5 September. OSCE monitors said they would observe the ceasefire, and assist the Ukrainian government in implementing it. According to The New York Times, the agreement was an \\"almost verbatim\\" replication of Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko's failed June \\"15-point peace plan\\". It was agreed that there would be an exchange of all prisoners taken by both sides, and that heavy weaponry should be removed from the combat zone. Humanitarian corridors were meant to be maintained, so that civilians could leave affected areas. President Poroshenko said that Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts would be granted \\"special status\\", and that use of the Russian language in these areas would be protected by law. DPR and LPR leaders said that they retained their desire for full independence from Ukraine, despite these concessions. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian president Poroshenko discussed the ceasefire on 6 September. Both parties said that they were satisfied with the ceasefire, and that it was generally holding. Destroyed terminal at Luhansk airport, 4 September 2014 The ceasefire was broken multiple times on the night of 6‚Äì7 September, and into the day on 7 September. These violations resulted in the deaths of four Ukrainian soldiers, whilst 29 were injured.Four Ukraine servicemen killed, 29 injured so far during ceasefire: Interfax, 9 September 2014 Heavy shelling by the insurgents was reported on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol, and OSCE monitors said that the Ukrainian government had fired rockets from Donetsk International Airport. The OSCE said that these breaches of the agreement would not cause the ceasefire to collapse. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 10 September that \\"70% of Russian troops have been moved back across the border\\", and also added that this action gave him \\"hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects\\". Ceasefire violations continued, however. In line with the Minsk Protocol, OSCE monitors said that they observed a prisoner exchange near Avdiivka at 03:40 on 12 September. Ukrainian forces released 31 DPR insurgents, whilst DPR forces released 37 Ukrainian soldiers. OSCE monitors documented violations of the Minsk Protocol in numerous areas of Donetsk Oblast from 13‚Äì15 September. These areas included Makiivka, Telmanove, Debaltseve, Petrovske, near Mariupol, Yasynuvata, and Donetsk International Airport, all of which saw intense fighting. Two of the armoured vehicles that the monitors were travelling in were struck by shrapnel, rendering one of the vehicles inoperable and forcing the monitors to retreat. According to the monitors, troop and equipment movements were being carried out by both DPR and Ukrainian forces. They also said that there were \\"command and control issues\\" amongst both parties to the conflict. A visit by the monitors to Luhansk International Airport took place on 20 September. They said that the airport was \\"completely destroyed\\", and entirely unusable. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 21 September that the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost between 60% and 65% of its total active equipment over the course of the war. DPR policemen in Donetsk, 20 September 2014 Members of the Trilateral Contact Group and the DPR took part in a video conference on 25 September 2014. According to a statement released by the OSCE on the day after the conference, all parties agreed that the fighting had \\"subsided in recent days\\", and that the \\"situation along 70%\\" of the buffer zone was \\"calm\\". They also said that they would \\"spare no efforts\\" to strengthen the ceasefire. Scattered violations of the ceasefire continued, nonetheless. In the most significant incident since the start of the ceasefire, seven Ukrainian soldiers died on 29 September when a tank shell struck the armoured personnel carrier that they were travelling in near Donetsk International Airport. A skirmish ensued, leaving many soldiers wounded. Over the next few days, fighting continued around Donetsk International Airport, whilst Donetsk city itself came under heavy shelling. Amidst this renewed violence, OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter issued a statement that \\"urged all sides to immediately stop fighting\\", and also said that putting the ceasefire at risk of collapse would be \\"irresponsible and deplorable\\". According to a report released by the UN Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 8 October, the ceasefire implemented by the Minsk Protocol was becoming \\"increasingly fragile\\". The statement that announced the release of the report said that at least 331 people had been killed since the start of ceasefire, and that the most fierce fighting took place around Donetsk International Airport, Debaltseve, and Shchastya. The report also said that the majority of civilian deaths were caused by both insurgent and Ukrainian shelling. Several hundred National Guard troops protested outside the Ukrainian presidential administration building in Kyiv on 13 October. They demanded the end of conscription, and their own demobilisation. According to Kyiv Post, many of the protesters stated that they had clashed with Euromaidan protesters, and that they were not in favour of that movement. = November 2014 separatist elections and aftermath = Donetsk suburb after shelling, 7 November 2014 Heavy fighting continued across the Donbass through October, despite the ceasefire. In violation of the procedure agreed to as part of the Minsk Protocol, DPR and LPR authorities held parliamentary and executive elections on 2 November. In response to the elections, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko asked parliament to revoke the \\"special status\\" that was granted to DPR and LPR- controlled areas as part of the Minsk Protocol. DPR deputy prime minister Andrei Purgin said that Ukrainian forces had launched \\"all-out war\\" against the DPR and LPR on 6 November. Ukrainian officials denied any offensive, and said that they would adhere to the Minsk Protocol. Despite this, battles continued across the Donbass, leaving many soldiers dead. Concurrently, separatist representatives requested a redraughting of Minsk Protocol, as a result of recurrent violations. Intermittent shelling of Donetsk renewed on 5 November. OSCE monitors reported on 8 November that there were large movements of unmarked heavy equipment in separatist-held territory. These movements included armoured personnel carriers, lorries, petrol tankers, and tanks, which were being manned and escorted by men in dark green uniforms without insignias. Ukrainian government spokesmen said that these were movements of Russian troops, but this could not be independently verified. Overnight into 9 November, intense shelling from both government and insurgent positions rocked Donetsk. OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter said that he was \\"very concerned\\" about the \\"resurgence of violence\\", and stressed the importance of adhering to the Minsk Protocol. OSCE monitors observed more munitions convoys in separatist-held territory on 9 November. These included 17 unmarked green ZiL lorries loaded with ammunition at Sverdlovsk, and 17 similar Kamaz lorries towing howitzers at Zuhres. Another convoy of 43 green military lories, some towing howitzers and rocket launchers, was observed by OSCE monitors in Donetsk on 11 November. Damaged building in Kurakhove, 26 November 2014 Following the reports of these troop and equipment movements, NATO General Philip Breedlove said on 12 November that he could confirm that Russian troops and heavy equipment had crossed into Ukraine during the preceding week. In response, the Ukrainian Defence Ministry said that it was preparing for a renewed offensive by pro-Russian forces. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said \\"there was and is no evidence\\" to support NATO's statement. By 2 December, at least 1,000 people had died during fighting in Donbass, since the signing of the Minsk Protocol in early September. A BBC report said that the ceasefire had been \\"a fiction\\". In light of this continued fighting, Ukrainian and separatist forces agreed to cease all military operations for a \\"Day of Silence\\" on 9 December. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that he hoped that the \\"Day of Silence\\" would encourage the signing of a new peace deal. Whilst no new peace talks took place following the \\"Day of Silence\\", fighting between Ukrainian and separatist forces lessened significantly over the course of December. A report by the International Crisis Group stated that the late 2014 financial crisis in Russia, in tandem with American and European economic sanctions, deterred further advances by pro-Russian forces. The report also raised concerns about the potential for \\"humanitarian catastrophe\\" in separatist-controlled Donbass during the cold winter months, saying that the separatists were unable \\"to provide basic services for the population\\". Ruins of Donetsk International Airport, December 2014. The control tower has since been completely destroyed. In line with the Minsk Protocol, more prisoner exchanges took place during the week of 21‚Äì27 December. More OSCE-organised talks were held in Minsk during that week, but they reached no result. In a press conference on 29 December, Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the Minsk Protocol was becoming effective \\"point by point\\", and also said that \\"progress\\" was being made. Since the signing of the Protocol, over 1,500 people held by the separatists had been released as part of the prisoner exchanges. Whereas Ukrainian forces had been losing about 100 men per day prior to the Protocol, only about 200 had been killed in the four months since its signing. Poroshenko also said that he believed that conflict would only end if Russian troops were to leave Donbass. = Escalation in January 2015 = OSCE monitors reported a \\"rise in tensions\\" following New Year's Day. Numerous ceasefire violations were recorded, with most occurring near Donetsk International Airport. Infighting amongst insurgent groups broke out in Luhansk Oblast. In one incident, LPR militants said that they had killed Alexander Bednov, the leader of the pro- Russian \\"Batman Battalion\\", on 2 January 2015. LPR officials said that Bednov had been running an \\"illegal prison\\", and that he had engaged in torturing prisoners. In another incident, the leader of an Antratsyt-based Don Cossack militant group, Nikolai Kozitsyn, said that the territory controlled by his group, claimed by the Luhansk People's Republic, had become part of the \\"Russian empire\\", and that Russian president Vladimir Putin was its \\"emperor\\". An intercity bus stopped at a government checkpoint in Buhas was hit by a Grad rocket on 13 January, killing 12 civilians. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko declared a day of national mourning. Buhas is south-west of Donetsk city. DPR Sparta Battalion commander Arseny Pavlov, Donetsk, 25 December 2014 The new terminal building at Donetsk International Airport, which had been a site of fighting between Ukrainian and separatist troops since May 2014, was captured by the DPR forces on 15 January. In the days prior to the capturing, the airport was heavily barraged by separatist rocket fire. DPR leader Alexander Zakharchenko stated that the capture of the airport was the first step toward regaining territory lost to Ukrainian forces during the middle of 2014. He said \\"Let our countrymen hear this: We will not just give up our land. We will either take it back peacefully, or like that\\", referring to the capture of the airport. Such an offensive by separatist forces would signal the complete breakdown of the frequently ignored Minsk Protocol, which established a buffer zone between Ukrainian-controlled and separatist- controlled territories. Ukrainian forces said that there had been \\"no order to retreat\\" from the airport, and DPR parliament chairman Andrey Purgin said that while DPR forces had gained control of the terminal buildings, fighting was ongoing because \\"the Ukrainians have lots of places to hide\\". Concurrently, a new round of Minsk talks, scheduled for 16 January by the Trilateral Contact Group on Ukraine, was called off after DPR and LPR leaders Alexander Zakharchenko and Igor Plotnitsky refused to attend. A government military operation at the weekend of 17‚Äì18 January resulted in Ukrainian forces recapturing most of Donetsk International Airport. According to Ukrainian NSDC representative Andriy Lysenko, the operation restored the lines of control established by the Minsk Protocol, and therefore did not constitute a violation of it. The operation caused fighting to move toward Donetsk proper, resulting in heavy shelling of residential areas of the city that border the airport. DPR authorities said that they halted government forces at Putylivskiy bridge, which connects the airport and the city proper. The bridge, which is strategically important, was destroyed during the fighting. OSCE monitors reported that shelling had caused heavy damage in the Donetsk residential districts of Kyivskyi, Kirovskyi, Petrovskyi, and Voroshilovskyi. DPR Somalia Battalion in the new terminal building of Donetsk Airport on 16 January 2015 Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said on 21 January that Russia had deployed more than 9,000 soldiers and 500 tanks, artillery units, and armoured personnel carriers in Donbass. An article that appeared in The Daily Telegraph said that deployment appeared to be \\"a response to Kiev's success\\" in retaining control of Donetsk International Airport. On the same day, Ukrainian forces attempted to surround the airport in an attempt to push back the insurgents. As Ukrainian and DPR forces fought away from the airport, a group of insurgents stormed the first and third floors of the new terminal building. Ukrainian troops held out on the second floor of the building until the ceiling collapsed, killing several soldiers. The remaining Ukrainian forces were either captured, killed, or were forced to withdraw from the airport, allowing DPR forces to overrun it. According to one volunteer, 37 Ukrainian troops died. The Daily Telegraph called the Ukrainian defeat at the airport \\"devastating\\". Donetsk civilians living in bomb shelter, January 2015 Following this victory, separatist forces began to attack Ukrainian forces along the line of control in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Particularly heavy fighting broke out along the Siverskyi Donets River, to the north-west of Luhansk city. Separatist forces captured a Ukrainian checkpoint at Krymske, attacked other checkpoints in the area, and shelled villages near Shchastya. Separatist forces also began an assault on the government-controlled town of Debaltseve in north-eastern Donetsk Oblast, barraging it with artillery fire. In addition, the DPR launched an attack on Mariupol from Shyrokyne during the morning of 24 January. A hail of Grad rockets killed at least 30 people, and wounded another 83. Heavy fighting continued in Debaltseve over the next week, resulting in many civilian and combatant casualties. French president Fran√ßois Hollande and German chancellor Angela Merkel put forth a new peace plan on 7 February. The Franco-German plan, drawn up after talks with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin, was seen as a revival of the Minsk Protocol. President Hollande said that the plan was the \\"last chance\\" for resolution of the conflict. The plan was put forth in response to American proposals to send armaments to the Ukrainian government, something that Chancellor Merkel said would only result in a worsening of the crisis. Fighting worsened in the run-up to the scheduled 11 February talks to discuss the Franco-German peace plan. DPR forces shelled the city of Kramatorsk on 10 February, which had last seen fighting in July 2014. The shelling targeted the city's Armed Forces headquarters, but also hit a nearby residential area. Seven people were killed, while 26 were wounded. In addition, the pro-government Azov Battalion launched an offensive to recapture separatist-controlled areas on the outskirts of Mariupol, centred on the village of Shyrokyne. Battalion commander Andriy Biletsky said his forces were moving toward Novoazovsk. In October 2015 a member of the monitoring mission Maksim Udovichenko, delegated to OSCE by Russia, was suspended for \\"misbehavior\\" involving alcohol while in Severodonetsk and admitted he is actually a GRU officer. = Minsk II ceasefire and denouement = thumb The scheduled summit at Minsk on 11 February 2015 resulted in the signing of a new package of peacemaking measures, called Minsk II, on 12 February. The plan, similar in content to the failed Minsk Protocol, called for an unconditional ceasefire, to begin on 15 February, amongst many other measures. Despite the signing of Minsk II, fighting continued around Debaltseve. DPR forces said that ceasefire did not apply to Debaltseve, and continued their offensive. Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from the Debaltseve area on 18 February, leaving separatist forces in control of it. In the week after the fall of Debaltseve to pro-Russian forces, fighting in the conflict zone abated. DPR and LPR forces began to withdraw artillery from the front lines as specified by Minsk II on 24 February, and Ukraine did so on 26 February. Ukraine reported that it had suffered no casualties during 24‚Äì26 February, something that had not occurred since early January 2015. Minor skirmishes continued into March, but the ceasefire was largely observed across the combat zone. Ukrainian and separatist forces had withdrawn most of the heavy weaponry specified in Minsk II by 10 March. Minor violations of the ceasefire continued throughout March and into April, though it continued to hold, and the numbers of casualties reported by both sides were greatly reduced. Fighting flared up again on 3 June 2015, when DPR insurgents launched an attack on government- controlled Marinka. Artillery and tanks were utilised in the battle there, which was described as the heaviest fighting since the signing of Minsk II. DPR armoured vehicles near Donetsk, May 2015 An anti-war protest took place in Donetsk city on 15 June. The protest, the first of its kind in pro-Russian separatist-controlled territory, called for an end to the fighting in Donbass. About 500 people, who had gathered outside the RSA building, shouted, \\"Stop the war!\\", \\"Give us back our houses, our homes are broken!\\", and \\"Get out of here!\\" Specifically, protesters demanded that the separatists cease firing rocket attacks from residential areas on the outskirts of Donetsk. Whilst all parties to the conflict continued to support implementation of the measures specified by Minsk II, minor skirmishes continued on a daily basis through June and July 2015. Ukrainian troops suffered losses on a daily basis, and the ceasefire was labelled \\"unworkable\\" and \\"impossible to implement\\". Despite constant fighting and shelling along the line of contact, no territorial changes occurred. This state of stalemate led the war to be labelled a \\"frozen conflict\\". Following months of ceasefire violations, the Ukrainian government, the DPR and the LPR jointly agreed to halt all fighting, starting on 1 September 2015. This agreement coincided with the start of the school year in Ukraine, and was intended to allow for another attempt at implementing the points of Minsk II. By 12 September, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that the ceasefire had been holding, and that the parties to the conflict were \\"very close\\" to reaching an agreement to withdraw heavy weaponry from the line of contact, as specified by Minsk II. The area around Mariupol, including Shyrokyne, saw no fighting. According to Ukrainian Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak, violence in the Donbass had reached its lowest level since the start of the war. Whilst the ceasefire continued to hold into November, no final settlement to the conflict was agreed. The New York Times described this result as part of \\"a common arc of post-Soviet conflict, visible in the Georgian enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Nagorno- Karabakh in Azerbaijan and in Transnistria\\", and said that separatist- controlled areas had become a \\"frozen zone\\", where people \\"live in ruins, amid a ruined ideology, in the ruins of the old empire.\\" This state of affairs continued into 2016, with a 15 April report by the BBC labelling the conflict as \\"Europe's forgotten war\\". Minor outbreaks of fighting continued along the line of contact, though no major territorial changes occurred. A new ceasefire came into effect on 1 September 2016, described at the time by BBC correspondent Tom Burridge as \\"the first time there has been a true halt to fighting in 11 months\\", and in 2018 described by TASS as the most successful ceasefire over the course of the conflict. Within days both sides accused each other of breaching the ceasefire, although they also stated that the ceasefire was widely observed. Nevertheless, on 6 September (2016), Ukrainian authorities reported the death of yet another soldier. On 24 December 2016, the tenth indefinite ceasefire since the start of the conflict came into effect; according to the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, and the separatists, the ceasefire was not observed.Ukraine rebels agree to new indefinite truce, SBS Australia (24 December 2016) Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, based on information received as of 19:30, 4 January 2017, OSCE (5 January 2017) Militants shell Ukrainian army positions 32 times in past 24 hours, Interfax- Ukraine (6 January 2017) Kiev forces violate ceasefire three times over past 24 hours ‚Äî news agency, TASS news agency (3 January 2017) = January 2017 eruption of heavy fighting and failed ceasefires = Pisky, January 2017 2016 was the first full calendar year of the conflict in which Ukraine lost no territories to pro- Russian forces.

On 18 February 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree whereby the Russian authorities would recognise personal and vehicle- registration documents issued by the DPR and LPR. The presidential decree referred to \\"permanent residents of certain areas of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts\\", without any mention of the self-proclaimed People's Republics.

But according to a Ukrainian Armed Forces spokesman on 20 February 2017 separatists attacks continued, although he did state there was a \\"significant reduction in military activity.\\" On 21 February OSCE's Secretary General Zannier stated there were still a significant number of violations of the cease-fire and \\"no evidence of the withdrawal of weapons\\".Monitor Says Ukraine Cease-Fire, Weapons Withdrawal Not Being Honored, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (22 February 2017) According to both parties to the conflict, the fourth truce attempt of 2017 collapsed within a few hours on 24 June 2017.Ukraine Says Two Soldiers Killed Despite Cease-Fire, Radio Free Europe (24 June 2017) Fragile 'Harvest Truce' Comes Into Being in East Ukraine, Sputnik News (24 June 2017) A \\"back to school ceasefire\\" to begin on 25 August 2017 also immediately collapsed when, on that very day, both combatants claimed that the other side had violated it.Ukraine's Back to School \\"Ceasefire\\", Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (29 August 2017) Ukrainian military violate back-to-school ceasefire, one civilian injured ‚Äì command, TASS news agency (16 September 2017) A further \\"Christmas ceasefire\\" that was to be upheld starting 00:00 (Eastern European Time) on 23 December 2017 was immediately broken by DPR and LPR forces according to the Ukrainian Armed Forces (reporting nine violations including the death of a Ukrainian soldier killed by an enemy sniper and claiming the Ukrainians had not fired back ). In turn, the DPR stated that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had broken the truce, while the LPR Luganskinformcenter news agency said the same, but also that, the \\"ceasefire is generally observed.\\" On 27 December 2017, as part of the Minsk deal, a prisoner swap was conducted with 73 Ukrainian soldiers exchanged for over 200 separatists. On 18 January 2018, the Ukrainian parliament passed a bill to regain control over separatist-held areas. The bill was adopted with support from 280 lawmakers in the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada (due to the War in Donbass and the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea, only 423 of the parliament's 450 seats were elected in the previous electionParliamentary elections not to be held at nine constituencies in Donetsk region and six constituencies in Luhansk region - CEC, Interfax- Ukraine (25 October 2014)Ukraine crisis: President calls snap vote amid fighting, BBC News (25 August 2014)). The Russian government denounced the bill, calling it \\"preparations for a new war\\", and accused the Ukrainian government of violating the Minsk agreement. The law on the reintegration of Donbass labeled the republics of Donetsk and Luhansk as \\"temporarily-occupied territories\\", while Russia was labeled as an \\"aggressor\\". The legislation granted President Poroshenko \\"the right to use military force inside the country, without consent from the Ukrainian parliament\\", which would include the reclaiming of Donbass. The bill supports a ban on trade and a transport blockade of the east that has been in place since 2017. Under the legislation, the only separatist-issued documents that Ukraine would recognize are birth and death certificates. A new ceasefire agreed by all parties to the conflict went into force on 5 March 2018. By 9 March, the Ukrainian military claimed it was not being observed by the DPR and LPR forces, who in turn claimed the same of the Ukrainian military.

Called the \\"Steinmeier formula\\", after its proposer the German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the agreement envisages the holding of free elections in DPR and LPR territories, observed and verified by the OSCE, and the subsequent reintegration of those territories into Ukraine with special status. Russia demanded the agreement's signing before any continuation of the \\"Normandy format\\" peace talks. A survey of public opinion in DPR and LPR-controlled Donbass conducted by the Centre for East European and International Studies in March 2019 found that 55% of those polled favoured reintegration with Ukraine. 24% of those in favour of reintegration supported a return to the pre-war administrative system for Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, while 33% percent supported special status for the region. In line with the Steinmeier formula, Ukrainian and separatist troops began withdrawing from the town of Zolote on 29 October. Attempts to withdraw earlier in the month had been prevented by protests from Ukrainian war veterans. A further withdrawal was successfully completed in Petrovske during November. Following the withdrawals, and a successful Russian‚ÄìUkrainian prisoner swap, Russian president Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel met in Paris on 9 December 2019 in a resumption of the Normandy format talks. The two sides agreed to exchange all remaining prisoners of war by the end of 2019, work toward new elections in Donbass, and schedule further talks. The coronavirus pandemic deteriorated the living conditions in the conflict zone. Particularly, quarantine measures imposed by Ukraine, the DPR, and the LPR prevents those in the occupied territories from crossing the line of contact, negating access to critical resources. Fighting increased in March, with nineteen civilians killed, more than in the previous five months combined. While some crossings opened to small numbers of people in June 2020, the DPR introduced new regulations, ostensibly to prevent the spread of coronavirus, which made it nigh impossible for most people to cross the line of contact. In contrast, the Russian border completely reopened. On 27 July 2020 a new (the 29th such attempt The longest truce in Donbass.

The militants violated the truce for the second time - a soldier was killed, Ukrayinska Pravda (6 September 2020)  Combatants  Foreign and domestic forces have participated in the conflict in the Donbass. While Russia denies its troops are currently operating in Ukraine, OSCE observers have witnessed Russian troops operating in Ukraine identifying themselves as Russian servicemen. A paper released by the Royal United Services Institute estimated that 9,000‚Äì12,000 Russian troops had been deployed to parts of eastern Ukraine in early 2015, with 42,000 troops having been involved in the combined service rotation. On 17 December 2015 President Vladimir Putin stated in a response to a question about the detained Russian GRU agents held in Ukraine that Russia had \\"people (in Ukraine) who work on resolving various issues there, including in the military sphere.\\" However, he went on to state \\"that doesn't mean there are regular Russian troops there.\\" This was generally taken as an admission by Russia that its special forces were involved in the conflict. According to Alexander Borodai, 50,000 Russian citizens have fought for separatist forces. As of February 2018, the number of separatist forces were estimated at around 31,000 out of which 80% (25,000) were Donbass residents, 15% (‚âà5,000) were military contractors from Russia and other countries and 3% (900‚Äì1,000) were regular Russian armed forces personnel. This proportion has significantly changed from earlier years, with \\"Russian command gradually filling up the military of the 'republics' with locals\\"; the primary driver being that salaries are no longer attractive for contractors from Russia, but highly attractive as stable source of income in economically impaired separatist territories. Regular soldiers in Donbass are offered anything from 15,000 and officers 25,000 RUB, while in Russian army these respective earnings are 20,000 and 68,000 RUB. Russian forces still occupy most command positions as well as operate advanced weapons, such as electronic warfare units. OSCE monitors periodically record convoys of military trucks crossing through unmarked locations along the Russian- controlled border, usually overnight. On a number of occasions, OSCE monitoring drones were downed with electronic warfare units. OSCE statements and spot reports caused significant anger in Ukraine as it vaguely reports military \\"convoys leaving and entering Ukraine on dirt roads in the middle of the night, in areas where there is no official crossing\\" without explicitly mentioning Russian armed forces. = Separatist insurgents = Alexander Zakharchenko takes an oath of office as the Prime Minister of the Donetsk People's Republic, 8 August 2014. DPR Vostok Battalion members in Donetsk on Victory Day 2014 Vostok Battalion  Donbass People's Militia  Igor Girkin, a Russian citizen from Moscow who commanded the Donbass People's Militia in Sloviansk, denied Russian involvement in the insurgency. He said his unit was formed during the Crimean crisis, and that two-thirds of its members were Ukrainian citizens. Girkin also said that the Sloviansk insurgents had agreed to work with the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic, despite some conflict between insurgent groups. According to a spokesman for the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants that occupied Sloviansk were \\"an independent group...supporting the Donetsk protest\\", while insurgents in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk identified themselves as members of Pavel Gubarev's Donbass People's Militia. The group's forces at Sloviansk included some professional soldiers amongst their ranks, as well as retired veterans, civilians, and volunteers, while those in Donetsk have been confirmed to include former Berkut special police officers. When asked by The Sunday Telegraph where their weapons had come from, one veteran of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan nodded at the Russian flag flying from the police station and said: \\"Look at that flag. You know which country that represents\\". An insurgent commander in Donetsk, Pavel Paramonov, told journalists he was from Tula Oblast in Russia. In Horlivka, police who defected were commanded by a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Russian Army, later identified as Igor Bezler. Former Soviet military veteran Vyacheslav Ponomarev, who declared himself mayor of Sloviansk, said that he appealed to old military friends to take part in the militia: \\"When I called on my friends, practically all of whom are ex military, they came to our rescue, not only from Russia but also from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Moldova.\\" A former separatist militant corroborated these stories in an interview with Radio Free Europe. He said that fighters, including some Cossack units, arrived from Russia to support the separatists. Another interview with an insurgent from Saint Petersburg was published in Gazeta. He claimed to be fighting voluntarily as part of the Russian Imperial Movement. In late July, the local support for the militia within the city of Donetsk was estimated to be 70% by a local entrepreneur interviewed by Die Welt.Du wachst auf und pl√∂tzlich bist du im Krieg.

Army of the South-East  The Army of the South-East (, Armiya Yugo-Vostoka) is a pro-Russian militant group that occupied various buildings in Luhansk Oblast. According to The Guardian, their personnel include former members of the disbanded Berkut special police. They were affiliated with the Luhansk People's Republic, but were merged with the Donbass People's Militia on 16 September to form the United Armed Forces of Novorossiya. Rebel from the Sparta Battalion in Donetsk  Russian Orthodox Army  The Russian Orthodox Army (, Russkaya pravoslavnaya armiya), a pro-Russian insurgent group in Ukraine, originated in May 2014 as part of the insurgency. It reportedly had 100 members at the time of its founding, including locals and Russian volunteers. As fighting between separatists and the Ukrainian government worsened in Donbass, membership rose to 350, and later to 4,000. Notable engagements of the ROA include the June 2014 skirmishes in Mariupol and Amvrosiivka Raion. The headquarters of the ROA is located in an occupied Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) building in Donetsk city. Members swore allegiance to Igor Girkin (\\"Strelkov\\"), insurgent and Minister of Defence of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. According to the Defence Ministry of Ukraine, the ROA has been in conflict with another pro-Russian militia, the Vostok Battalion, which accused the ROA of looting, and of avoiding combat.  Vostok Battalion  Victory Day military parade in Donetsk DPR leadership in Donetsk in 2018 The Vostok Battalion (, ; lit. \\"East Battalion\\") was formed in early May 2014. It is commanded by Alexander Khodakovsky, a defector from the Security Service of Ukraine. Khodakovsky is the chief of the DPR's security service, and of the Patriotic Forces of Donbass, an insurgent battalion. Khodakovsky said that the \\"overwhelming majority\\" of his men came from eastern Ukraine. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Vostok reportedly includes former members of the original Vostok Battalion, a special forces unit of the Russian intelligence directorate (GRU) that participated in the Second Chechen and Russo-Georgian Wars. The original battalion was incorporated in 2009 into a Russian Defence Ministry reserve unit that is based in Chechnya. Khodakovsky said he had about 1,000 men at his disposal, and that more \\"volunteers\\" with experience in the Russian security sector were expected to join the battalion. A report by Radio Free Europe said that there were suspicions that the battalion was either created directly by the GRU, or that it was at least sanctioned by it. The battalion includes both fighters from Russia and from Ukraine. A BBC News report said that the battalion was composed largely of untrained locals from eastern Ukraine, with a smattering of Russian volunteers. A number of the Vostok insurgents were killed at the First Battle of Donetsk Airport. 30 bodies were repatriated to Russia after the fighting. Some of the members said they received salaries of 100 US dollars a week, though they maintained that were only volunteers. An Armenian volunteer in the unit said the battalion was composed of Slavs, and that roughly 80% of militants were from Russia. By late February 2015, 110 members of the battalion had been killed and 172 wounded in the conflict.  Police and military defectors and deserters  In May 2014, then Ukrainian president Oleksandr Turchynov stated that numerous Ukrainian military and security personnel had joined the separatists, alongside stolen Ukrainian military equipment. In October 2014, Internal Affairs minister Arsen Avakov told journalists that about 15,000 Ukrainian policemen in Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts had defected to the separatists.15,000 police ‚Äòdefected to Donbas separatists‚Äô.

Several of these Cossacks formed a paramilitary unit called the 'Terek Wolves Sotnia', a reference to a detachment of White emigre Cossacks that fought against the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Prominent fighters include Alexander \\"Boogeyman\\" Mozhaev (a Russian military veteran from Belorechensk) and the unit's commander, Evgeny Ponomarev. Ponomarev was killed in August 2014. Don Cossack National Guard ceremonial parade in Perevalsk, 7 September 2014 Although Cossack units have been prohibited from crossing the Russian border into Ukraine en masse, it has been reported that Russian elements tacitly support the individual fighters in crossing the border into Ukraine. The Cossacks claim that it is their faith in Cossack brotherhood, Russian imperialism, and the Russian Orthodox Church that has driven them to take part in the insurgency with the aim of conquering what they perceive as \\"historically Russian lands.\\" Mozhaev also stated that some of the more extreme views of the Cossacks include destroying \\"the Jew-Masons,\\" who they claim have been \\"fomenting disorder all over the world\\" and \\"causing us, the common Orthodox Christian folk, to suffer.\\" On 25 May, the SBU arrested 13 Russian Cossacks in Luhansk. = Caucasian and Central Asian armed groups = Vostok Brigade during the 2015 Victory Day Parade rehearsal The Foreign Affairs ministry of Ukraine said that the presence of foreign soldiers amounted to \\"undisguised aggression\\" from Russia, and \\"the export of Russian terrorism to our country\\". \\"There are grounds to affirm that Russian terrorists funnelled on to the territory of Ukraine are being organised and financed through the direct control of the Kremlin and Russian special forces,\\" the ministry said. To date, reports and interviews have shown the presence of Chechen, Ossetian, Tajik, Afghan, Armenian, and various Russian paramilitary forces operating in Ukraine.  Chechen paramilitaries  Chechen paramilitaries were spotted in Sloviansk on 5 May 2014. Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov threatened on 7 May that he would \\"send tens of thousands of Chechen volunteers to southern and eastern Ukraine if the junta in Kiev continued its punitive operations.\\" It was reported that Kadyrov engaged in an aggressive recruitment campaign in Chechnya for this operation, and that there were recruitment centres for it in Grozny, Achkhoy-Martan, Znamenskoye, and Gudermes. The Kavkazcenter, the official website of the North Caucasus Islamic insurgency, reported that Chechen authorities had opened recruiting offices for volunteers wishing to fight in Ukraine, and that those offices had suddenly closed. Five lorries crossed the Ukraine-Russia border carrying militants aboard on 24 May, with some reports suggesting among the militants were veteran Chechen soldiers. On the following day, the Vostok Battalion arrived in Donetsk in a convoy of eight lorries, each filled with 20 soldiers. Several of the soldiers looked Chechen, spoke the Chechen language, and said that they were from Chechnya. Two insurgents told CNN reporters that these were Chechen volunteers. Ramzan Kadyrov denied knowledge of the presence Chechen troops in Ukraine, but a separatist commander later confirmed that Chechens and militants of other ethnicities fought for the Donetsk People's Militia. In the aftermath of the First Battle of Donetsk Airport, local authorities said that some wounded militants were Chechens from Grozny and Gudermes. One Donetsk resident said that the presence of Chechen fighters showed \\"that this war is not clean. It is artificially created. If this is an uprising by the Donetsk People's Republic, what are foreigners doing here?\\" Chechen militants interviewed by the Financial Times and Vice News said that they became involved in the conflict on the orders of the Chechen president. President Kadyrov strongly denied these reports on 1 June. In his statement, he said that there were \\"74,000 Chechens who are willing to go to bring order to the territory of Ukraine\\", and that he would not send them to Donetsk, but to Kyiv. As of May 2015, majority of previously pro-Russian Chechen paramilitaries exited the conflict, because of the two known incidents with Zakharchenko and his people, according to Akhmed Zakayev. Zakharchenko and Fazlibei Avidzba, member of the People's Assembly of Abkhazia, Donetsk, 27 December 2014  Ossetian and Abkhaz paramilitaries  Starting on 4 May 2014, the United Ossetia Party and the Union of Paratroopers in the pro- Russian breakaway Republic of South Ossetia announced a recruitment drive meant to send veterans of the Georgian-Ossetian conflict to protect \\"the peaceful population of Ukraine's southeast\\". Some videos issued by an Ossetian militant group indicated that they were operating in Donetsk. Donbass insurgents interviewed on 27 May admitted that there were 16 fighters from Ossetia operating around Donetsk for at least two months prior. Head of the State Border Guard of Ukraine Mykola Lytvyn said that officials reports indicated the presence of Abkhaz militants as well. Militants from North and South Ossetia were open about their presence in Donbass in June. One militant named Oleg, part of the Vostok Battalion, told reporters \\"In 2008 they were killing us and the Russians saved us. I came here to pay my dues to them\\".  Others  There are reports that volunteers from France, Germany, the United States, Italy, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Turkey and other countries have fought on the insurgent side. There are at least 200 insurgent- affiliated Serbian volunteers fighting in Ukraine. They have their own combat unit, named after Jovan ≈†eviƒá, including 45 members of the Chetnik movement, led by Bratislav ≈Ωivkoviƒá. Around 20 Hungarians have formed their own unit named Legion of Saint Stephen. In February 2015, Spanish police arrested eight Spaniards suspected of fighting alongside pro-Russian militants. Commenting on other foreign fighters, the suspects said that \\"Half of them are communists and the other half are Nazis. [...] We all want the same: social justice and the liberation of Russia from the Ukrainian invasion.\\" The German newspaper Welt am Sonntag reported that more than 100 German citizens were fighting alongside pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine. Most of them were ethnic Germans from the former Soviet republics, and some had served in the Bundeswehr. According to the paper, a 33-year-old German citizen originally from Kazakhstan was killed in action by shrapnel during the battle of Debaltsevo, on 12 February 2015. Kazakhstan has given prison sentences of three to five years to its citizens who have fought for pro-Russian militias in Ukraine. In February 2016, Moldova stated that pro-Russian forces in Ukraine had recruited dozens of its citizens with the offer of money, with one individual saying he had been promised $3,000 a month. Two Moldovan mercenaries received three-year prison sentences and eight others were under investigation. From late 2014 until late 2017 Serbia has opened 45 cases against Serbian mercenaries who had been fighting in the War in Donbass and in other military conflicts abroad. According to media reports by late 2017 only a few dozen Serbs were then fighting in Ukraine and Syria. In August 2019 a Serbian citized Goran Chirich was placed under arrest by Russian Federation for \\"illegal crossing of border\\" from Donbass based on Interpol arrest warrant issued by Serbia, requesting his extradition. In May 2020 his appeal against extradition was denied by a court in Rostov-on-Don based on the fact that Chirich does not have Russian citizenship and so called \\"DPR passports\\" are not recognized legally even in Russia. = Counter-insurgency forces = Ukrainian troops near Avdiivka  Armed Forces of Ukraine  The Armed Forces of Ukraine are the primary military force of Ukraine, and have taken a leading role in countering DPR and LPR forces. In 2014, the Armed Forces was said to be \\"in a disastrously impoverished state\\", and \\"had almost no training in confronting an internal land battle\\". It has been widely criticised for its poor equipment and inept leadership, forcing Internal Affairs Ministry forces like the National Guard and the territorial defence battalions to take on the brunt of the fighting in the first months of the war. Following its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited all Soviet military equipment and formations that had been stationed on its territory. Over the years preceding the start of hostilities in Donbass, the Armed Forces were systematically downsized, and became largely dilapidated. Soviet weaponry was not replaced or upgraded, leaving the Armed Forces with outdated and poorly maintained equipment. As an example, the Soviet military units never utilised ballistic vests, and hence, when the war in Donbass started, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had none. Whilst there is a vibrant defence industry in Ukraine, the equipment it produces is for export, and had not been used to equip the Armed Forces prior to the war. Amidst the Crimean Crisis on 11 March 2014, then Defence Minister Ihor Tenyukh said that \\"de facto only 6,000 [soldiers] are in combat readiness\\". According to a report by The Ukrainian Week, 90‚Äì95% of the Armed Forces' equipment in July 2014 was outdated or in poor repair. In addition, professional soldiers were in short supply, forcing conscripts and volunteers to fill battalions.In the Army Now: Answering Many Why's, The Ukrainian Week (8 July 2014) To counter equipment shortages, a powerful civil volunteer movement appeared. Teams of volunteers established crowdfunding centres that provide the soldiers with diverse support: from food and medicines to equipment like bulletproof vests, spaced armour, thermographic cameras and unmanned aerial vehicles. Other volunteers help the injured soldiers or search captives and the killed ones. Such volunteer centres work in all large cities and many small settlements of Ukraine, except those which aren't controlled by government. In 2016, Ukraine was struggling to recruit conscript servicemen, due to significant evasion of conscription, to replace demobilising soldiers including volunteers. This followed negative publicity about nutrition and equipment deficiencies in the conflict zone. By mid-April 2016, 127,363 soldiers and volunteers had received veteran status. By February 2018, the Ukrainian Armed Forces were larger and better equipped than ever before, numbering 200,000 active-service military personnel and most of the volunteer soldiers of the territorial defence battalions have been integrated into the official Ukrainian army.Ukraine‚Äôs Toughest Fight: The Challenge of Military Reform, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (22 February 2018)  National Guard of Ukraine  The National Guard of Ukraine was re-established on 13 March 2014, amidst rising tensions in Ukraine during the Crimean crisis. (Article is in Ukrainian) It is a part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It was re-established to replace the Internal Troops of Ukraine, and is based on that force.  Ministry of Internal Affairs  The Ministry of Internal Affairs is commonly known as the militsiya, and is the primary police force in Ukraine. It is led by the Internal Affairs Minister, Arsen Avakov, a key figure in leading the counter- insurgency operations in the Donbass.  Security Service of Ukraine  Donbas Battalion in Donetsk region, 9 August 2014 The government military operation to counter DPR and LPR forces in the Donbass is called the \\"Anti- Terrorist Operation\\" (ATO). It is led by the Anti-Terrorist Centre, a division of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The SBU is the main intelligence service of Ukraine.  Pro-government paramilitaries  At least 50 pro- Ukrainian volunteer units have been formed and fought against the Donbass People's Militia and other insurgent groups. These forces include the Donbas Battalion, Azov Battalion, Kharkiv Battalion, and Oleh Lyashko's militia. Some of these units work under contract with the National Guard of Ukraine. Azov Battalion volunteers in Kyiv, June 2014 These units took active participation in the military campaign. For example, the town of Shchastya in Luhansk Oblast was taken by the Aidar Battalion on 9 July, and Azov Battalion, together with other units, recaptured Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists forces in June 2014. Some of the volunteer battalions belong to Right Sector. It lost 12 fighters when it was ambushed outside Donetsk in August 2014. Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh vowed his group would avenge the deaths. Foreign fighters mainly from Belarus, Georgia and Russia (about 100 men from each country) have joined the volunteer battalions, \`\`\`\` as well as volunteers from the United States, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Georgia, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Croatia, Italy and Canada. The Foreign Ministry of Russia asked the governments of Sweden, Finland, the Baltic states, and France to conduct a thorough investigation into reports of mercenaries from their countries serving Ukrainian forces, following a story in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale. Chechen opponents of the Russian government, including Chechen military commander Isa Munayev, were fighting pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine for the Ukrainian government. At least three volunteer battalions composed mostly of people from the Caucasus and Central Asia are fighting against pro-Russian separatists.\\"Foreign Islamic Battalions Fight To Defend Ukraine Against Rebels\\".

There are ongoing attempts by the Ukrainian Armed Forces to integrate volunteer battalions into the regular army and indeed many of the volunteers fighting in those groups were drafted into the army. The status of the remaining volunteer units remain legally ambiguous.Ukraine‚Äôs ‚ÄúInvisible‚Äù Volunteer Fighters, Hromadske.TV (18 November 2018) German military criticized over Ukrainian medical evacuation flights, Deutsche Welle (09.08.2018)  Russian involvement  Russian flag can be seen in the background. Russian involvement in the Donbass War has taken a variety of forms since the beginning of the conflict in 2014. The initial protests across southern and eastern Ukraine were largely native expressions of discontent with the new Ukrainian government. Russian involvement at this stage was limited to its voicing of support for the demonstrations, and the emergence of the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk began as a small fringe group of the protesters, independent of Russian control. Russia would go on to take advantage of this, however, to launch a co-ordinated political and military campaign against Ukraine, as part of the broader Russo-Ukrainian War. Russian president Vladimir Putin gave legitimacy to the nascent separatist movement when he described the Donbass as part of the historic \\"New Russia\\" (Novorossiya) region, and issued a statement of bewilderment as how the region had ever become part of Ukraine in 1922 with the foundation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. When the Ukrainian authorities cracked down on the pro-Russian protests and arrested local separatist leaders in early March, these were replaced by people with ties to the Russian security services and interests in Russian businesses, probably by order of Russian intelligence. By April 2014, Russians citizens had taken control of the separatist movement, and were supported by volunteers and materiel from Russia, including Chechen and Cossack militants.Strelkov/Girkin Demoted, Transnistrian Siloviki Strengthened in 'Donetsk People's Republic', Vladimir Socor, Jamestown Foundation, 15 August 2014 According to DPR insurgent commander Igor Girkin, without this support in April, the movement would have fizzled out, as in it did in Kharkiv and Odessa. As conflict between the separatists and the Ukrainian government escalated in May 2014, Russia began to employ a \\"hybrid approach\\", deploying a combination of disinformation tactics, irregular fighters, regular Russian troops, and conventional military support to support the separatists and destabilise the Donbass region. The First Battle of Donetsk Airport in late May 2014 marked a turning point in conflict; it was the first battle between the separatists and the Ukrainian government that involved large amounts of Russian volunteers. According to the Ukrainian government, at the height of the conflict in the summer of 2014, Russian paramilitaries were reported to make up between 15% to 80% of the combatants. By August 2014, the Ukrainian \\"Anti-Terrorist Operation\\" was able to vastly shrink the territory under the control of the pro-Russian forces, and came close to regaining control of the Russo-Ukrainian border. Igor Girkin urged Russian military intervention, and said that the combat inexperience of his irregular forces, along with recruitment difficulties amongst the local population in Donetsk Oblast had caused the setbacks. He addressed Russian president Vladimir Putin, saying that: \\"Losing this war on the territory that President Vladimir Putin personally named New Russia would threaten the Kremlin's power and, personally, the power of the president\\". In response to the deteriorating situation in the Donbass, Russia abandoned its hybrid approach, and began a conventional invasion of the region. The first sign of this invasion was the 25 August 2014 capture of a group of Russian paratroopers on active service in Ukrainian territory by the Ukrainian security service (SBU). The SBU released photographs of them, and their names. On the following day, the Russian Defence Ministry said these soldiers had crossed the border \\"by accident\\". According to Nikolai Mitrokhin's estimates, by mid-August 2014 during the Battle of Ilovaisk, there were between 20,000 and 25,000 troops fighting in the Donbass on the separatist side, and only between 40% and 45% were \\"locals\\". Beginning on 27 August 2014, vast amounts of military equipment and troops crossed the border from Russia into southern Donetsk Oblast, an area previously controlled by the Ukrainian government. Western officials described this new offensive as a \\"stealth invasion\\" by the Russian Federation. US State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said that \\"these incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway\\", and Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said \\"An invasion of Russian forces has taken place\\". NATO commander Brig. Gen. Nico Tak said on 28 August 2014 that \\"well over\\" 1,000 Russian soldiers were operating in the Donbass conflict zone. During the week prior to the invasion, Russia shelled Ukrainian units from across the border. Instances of cross-border shelling from Russia had been reported for six weeks from mid-July, during which the Russians launched 53 strikes at 40 different locations, severely impacting the Ukrainian military operation. At the time, Russian government spokesmen denied all reports of Russian intervention in the Donbass. These denials have been viewed as implausible, to the point where it seemed that the Russian government no longer cared about the appearance of propriety. There was limited support for separatism in Donbass before the outbreak of the war, and little evidence of support for an armed uprising. Only Russian intervention prevented an immediate Ukrainian resolution to the conflict. As a result, in the run up to the August 2014 invasion, Russia had also decided to replace many of the hardline leaders of the separatist movement, including Igor Girkin and DPR prime minister Alexander Borodai. These replacements, taken together with the subsequent invasion, represented another turning point in the nature of the conflict. Given the recent military failings of the DPR and the LPR, Russia decided that it could no longer rely on a patchwork of irregular fighters in the Donbass, and ordered a change in leadership. It abandoned the hardline Russian citizen-led separatist project, which it had been unable to fully control, and replaced it with the idea of special status for Donbass within Ukraine, and a more obedient local-based DPR/LPR command. This represented Russia's attempts at \\"indigenisation\\" of the conflict, using the militarily insignificant local pro-Russian political activists as political cover for the advancement of Russian interests in Ukraine. Russian forces and equipment went on to participate in the Second Battle of Donetsk Airport and the Battle of Debaltseve. A report released by the Royal United Services Institute in March 2015 said that \\"the presence of large numbers of Russian troops on Ukrainian sovereign territory\\" had become a \\"permanent feature\\" of the war in Donbass since the August 2014 invasion. Following the Ukrainian defeat at Debaltseve, the parties to the conflict signed the Minsk II agreement to end the fighting on 15 February 2015. These terms were highly favourable to Russia, in that they required Ukraine to grant \\"special status\\" to the separatist-held areas, and reintegrate them into Ukraine, similar to the federalisation espoused by pro-Russian protesters in early 2014. This would establish a Russian \\"strategic hook\\" within Ukraine that could be used to prevent future integration of that country with the European Union or NATO. In a press conference on 17 December 2015, Russian president Vladimir Putin acknowledged for the first time that there had been a Russian military presence in the Donbass region, though he said that this did not mean that there were \\"Russian troops\\" there. On 24 April 2019, President Putin issued an executive order fast-tracking the process for obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the territories held by the DPR and the LPR. This is similar to what Russia has done in other pro-Russian protectorates established following post-Soviet conflicts, including in Transnistria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.  Humanitarian concerns  Damaged building in Lysychansk, 4 August 2014 The United Nations observed an \\"alarming deterioration\\" in human rights in territory held by insurgents affiliated with the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The UN reported growing lawlessness in the region, documenting cases of targeted killings, torture, and abduction, primarily carried out by the forces of the Donetsk People's Republic. The UN also reported threats against, attacks on, and abductions of journalists and international observers, as well as the beatings and attacks on supporters of Ukrainian unity. Russia criticised these reports, and said that they were \\"politically motivated\\". A report by Human Rights Watch said \\"Anti-Kiev forces in eastern Ukraine are abducting, attacking, and harassing people they suspect of supporting the Ukrainian government or consider undesirable...anti-Kiev insurgents are using beatings and kidnappings to send the message that anyone who doesn't support them had better shut up or leave\\". There were also multiple instances of beatings, abductions, and possible executions of local residents by Ukrainian troops, such as Oleh Lyashko's militia and the Aidar territorial defence battalion. Amnesty International noted that pro-Kyiv volunteer battalions are increasingly blocking humanitarian aid into eastern Ukraine. In August, Igor Druz, a senior advisor to pro-Russian insurgent commander Igor Girkin, said that \\"On several occasions, in a state of emergency, we have carried out executions by shooting to prevent chaos. As a result, our troops, the ones who have pulled out of Sloviansk, are highly disciplined\\". By the end of 2015, there had been 79 places in the combined DPR and LPR territory where abducted civilians and prisoners of war were held. A report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released on 28 July 2014 said that based on \\"conservative estimates\\", at least 1,129 civilians had been killed since mid-April during the fighting, and at least 3,442 had been wounded. In addition, the report found that at least 750 million US dollars worth of damage has been done to property and infrastructure in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Human Rights Watch said that Ukrainian government forces, pro-government paramilitaries, and the insurgents had used unguided Grad rockets in attacks on civilian areas, stating that \\"The use of indiscriminate rockets in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, and may amount to war crimes\\".\\"Human Rights Watch: Ukrainian forces are rocketing civilians\\". The Washington Post. 25 July 2014. The New York Times reported that the high rate of civilian deaths had \\"left the population in eastern Ukraine embittered toward Ukraine's pro-Western government\\", and that this sentiment helped to \\"spur recruitment\\" for the insurgents. By early January 2015, the number of deaths caused by the war had risen to 4,707, despite the signing of the Minsk Protocol in early September 2014. Iversky Monastery near Donetsk airport, May 2015 By early August 2014, at least 730,000 had fled fighting in the Donbass and left for Russia. This number, much larger than earlier estimates, was given by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The number of internal refugees rose to 117,000. By the start of September, after a sharp escalation over the course of August, the number of people displaced from Donbass within Ukraine more than doubled to 260,000. The number of refugees that fled from Donbass to Russia rose to 814,000. Despite two months of a shaky ceasefire established by the Minsk Protocol, the number of refugees displaced from Donbass in Ukraine escalated sharply to 466,829 in mid November. By April 2015, the war had caused at least 1.3 million people to become internally displaced within Ukraine. In addition, more than 800,000 people had fled Ukraine, with over 659,143 to Russia, 81,100 to Belarus, and thousands more to other countries. According to another report by the UN OHCHR, over 3 million people continued to live in the Donbass conflict zone as of March 2016. This was said to include 2.7 million who lived in DPR and LPR- controlled areas, and 200,000 in Ukrainian-controlled areas adjacent to the line of contact. In addition, the Ukrainian government was said to have registered a total of 1.6 million internally displaced people within Ukraine who had fled the conflict. Over 1 million were reported to have sought asylum elsewhere, with most having gone to Russia. The report also said that people that lived in separatist-controlled areas were experiencing \\"complete absence of rule of law, reports of arbitrary detention, torture and incommunicado detention, and no access to real redress mechanisms\\". By November 2017, the UN had identified 1.8 million internally displaced and conflict-affected persons in Ukraine, while another 427,240 who had sought asylum or refugee status in the Russian Federation, plus 11,230 in Italy, 10,495 in Germany, 8,380 in Spain, and 4,595 in Poland.UN High Commissioner for Refugees, \\"Ukraine: UNHCR Operational Update, 01‚Äì30 November 2017\\", 15 December 2017.  Casualties  The number of confirmed fatalities (deaths) caused by the war was 13,000‚Äì13,200 as of mid-February 2020. By the end of July 2020, the UN confirmed 3,367 civilians had been killed in the conflict. 312 of the civilian deaths were foreigners: 298 passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, 11 Russian journalists, an Italian journalist, one Russian civilian killed in cross-border shelling and a Lithuanian diplomat. = Ukrainian forces = Ukrainian government forces have lost a confirmed total of 4,459 killed servicemen by early July 2020, including 211 foreign-born Ukrainian citizens and 13 foreigners.The Museum of Military History also lists separately 139 currently unidentified soldiers who were killed: 66 at Krasnopolye cemetery, 63 at Kushugum cemetery and 10 at Starobilsk cemetery. Another 70 Ukrainian soldiers were missing. Pro-Russian sources claimed Ukrainian forces had: 10,000 killed, 20,000 wounded and 13,500 deserted or missing, by late June 2015. = Separatist forces = The separatists reported that they had lost 1,400 men at most as of the beginning of February 2015. The United Nations reported 5,650 separatists were killed by mid-February 2020. Ukraine claimed 7,577‚Äì14,600 separatists had been killed and 12,000 missing during the fighting as of early 2015. They also claimed an additional 103 Russian servicemen were killed between January and April 2016. An image of a reported separatist graveyard in Donetsk in late February 2015, showed number plates running up to at least 2,213. In late August 2015, according to a reported leak by a Russian news site, Business Life (Delovaya Zhizn), 2,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine by 1 February 2015. The US Department of State reported that by early March 2015, 400‚Äì500 Russian soldiers had died. By the end of August 2020, DPR separatist authorities reported that a total of 4,932 separatists and civilians had been killed in DPR-controlled territory, while the LPR reported 1,328 people had died in the LPR by January 2018.  Reactions  Many observers have asked both the Ukrainian government and the insurgents to seek peace, and ease tensions in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian President Poroshenko speaks with Barack Obama and other Western leaders during the NATO Summit in Newport, 4 September 2014 ‚Äì NATO published a statement on the war in Donbass and the Crimean Crisis in August 2014. It attempted to debunk the Russian government's accusations against the Ukrainian government, and also other statements made by Russia to justify its presence in Ukraine. According to the statement, Russia attempted to \\"divert attention away from its actions\\" and \\"levelled a series of accusations against NATO which are based on misrepresentations of the facts\\". It also said that Russia \\"made baseless attacks on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and has used force to seize part of Ukraine's territory\\". In response to the unauthorised entry of the Russian humanitarian convoy on 22 August, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that this incident could \\"only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel. The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists\\". Late in August, NATO generals met and revised their assessment of the military situation in Donbass. They said that, from the Ukrainian government's point of view, the war is already lost. It was anticipated that the late-August offensive in southern Donetsk Oblast could be used to create a Russian land corridor to Crimea, consolidating the illegal annexation of the peninsula. NATO general Philip Breedlove said on 20 September that the ceasefire implemented as part of the Minsk Protocol was \\"a ceasefire in name only\\", and criticised Russia for allowing men and equipment to flow freely across its border into Donbass. ‚Äì The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian authorities of \\"blaming\\" the Russian government for all its troubles and stated \\"Ukrainian people want to get a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims\\". It also stated it was \\"carefully observing\\" events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for \\"real constitutional reform\\" that would turn Ukraine into a federation.Ukraine crisis escalates as pro- Russia activists declare independence in Donetsk, The Guardian (7 April 2014) In a 7 April opinion piece that appeared in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote that it was Europe and the United States, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that \\"Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine\\".Sergei Lavrov: It's not Russia that is destabilising Ukraine, The Guardian (7 April 2014) The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern condemnation of the \\"criminal order\\" by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk: \\"The Kiev authorities, who self- proclaimed themselves as a result of a coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests,\\" demanding that \\"the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, to immediately stop the war against their own people, to fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February.\\"Russia Today, Moscow slams Kiev's military op order as 'criminal', calls for UNSC meeting, 13 April 2014.

A spokeswoman for the US National Security Council noted that the separatists appeared to be supported by Russia. \\"We saw similar so-called protest activities in Crimea before Russia's purported annexation,\\" she said in a statement, adding: \\"We call on President (Vladimir) Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine, and we caution against further military intervention.\\" American ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt characterised the pro-Russian insurgents as \\"terrorists\\".Voice of America, Q&A; with US Amb. Geoffrey Pyatt: Ukraine Crisis Escalates as War Fears Grow, 14 April 2014. The US government is sending military advisors to Ukraine to aid the Ukrainian government in its fight against the insurgents. In April, the US Defence Department shipped a 7 million US dollar package of non-lethal military equipment to the Ukrainian forces. Plans for another 8 million dollar aid package were announced on 1 August 2014. The package was meant to include armoured personnel carriers, goods and patrol vehicles, binoculars, night vision goggles and small patrol boats. On the same day, the Defence Department also proposed a $19 million aid package to help train the National Guard of Ukraine. This proposal required congressional approval, and would come into effect in 2015. It had been announced in July that a group of Defence Department specialists in strategy and policy would visit Kiev to evaluate the military needs of the Ukrainian government. On 8 September 2014, The New York Times reported that only a portion of the initial non-lethal aid package had actually arrived in Ukraine. While this report cited concerns about provoking escalation in the region as the reason for the delay, a 13 September 2014 report by The Globe and Mail cited various sources that indicated that both the American package and a $200 million Canadian military aid package were delayed by concerns about diversion of saleable equipment due to corruption among Ukrainian officials. On 11 March 2015, the American government said it would send an additional 75 million US dollars worth of non-lethal aid to Ukraine. This included radios, first-aid kits, surveillance drones, counter-mortar radar systems, military ambulances, 30 armoured Humvees and 300 unarmoured Humvees. In March 2016, US Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated that a total of 266 million dollars was spent on non-lethal aid to Ukraine. She also said that nearly 1,200 Ukrainian soldiers and 750 National Guard members had been trained by American military personnel. ‚Äì Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko pledged revenge against pro-Russian separatists after 19 Ukrainian soldiers were killed in a rocket attack. \\"Militants will pay hundreds of their lives for each life of our servicemen. Not a single terrorist will avoid responsibility,\\" he said. = Ukrainian public opinion = Residents of Kyiv with Svoboda founded Sich Battalion soldiers, 26 August 2014 A poll of the Ukrainian public, excluding Russian- annexed Crimea, was taken by the International Republican Institute from 12‚Äì25 September 2014.Press release: Full text: 89% of those polled opposed Russian intervention in Ukraine. As broken down by region, 78% of those polled from Eastern Ukraine (including Dnipropetrovsk Oblast) opposed said intervention, along with 89% in Southern Ukraine, 93% in Central Ukraine, and 99% in Western Ukraine. As broken down by native language, 79% of Russian speakers and 95% of Ukrainian speakers opposed the intervention. 80% of those polled said that Ukraine should remain a unitary country. 56% of those polled said that Russia should pay for the reconstruction of the Donbass, whereas 32% said Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts should pay. 59% of those polled said that they supported the government military operation in Donbass, whereas 33% said that they opposed it. 73% of respondents said that the war in Donbass was one of the three most important issues facing Ukraine. A poll conducted by the same institute in 2017 shows that an overwhelming majority of Ukrainians believe that the separatist republics should remain as part of Ukraine. The survey contained an over sample of respondents from the Ukrainian-controlled areas of the Donbass, a majority of whom also affirmed their wish for the entire region to stay in Ukraine. The survey results showed that 80% of Ukrainians nationally and 73% of people living in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts supported that the separatist-controlled areas should remain part of Ukraine. Around 60% of the people polled did not believe Ukraine is doing enough to regain the lost territories because of the Minsk agreements. = Labelling of the conflict = The understanding of the nature of the conflict in Donbass has evolved over time. NATO said in July 2014 that it considered the conflict a war with Russian irregulars, and others considered it to be a war between Russian proxies and Ukraine. The International Committee of the Red Cross described the events in the Donbass region as a \\"non-international armed conflict\\" in July 2014. Some news agencies, such as the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia and Reuters, interpreted this statement as meaning that Ukraine was in a state of \\"civil war\\". Following the August 2014 invasion by Russian forces, in early September 2014, Amnesty International said that it considered the war to be \\"international\\", as opposed to \\"non-international\\". Secretary General of Amnesty International Salil Shetty said that \\"satellite images, coupled with reports of Russian troops captured inside Ukraine and eyewitness accounts of Russian troops and military vehicles rolling across the border leave no doubt that this is now an international armed conflict\\". The conflict has also been classified as part of a \\"hybrid war\\" waged by Russia against Ukraine. Until early 2015, the European Union tended to label the participants of the conflict as \\"foreign armed formations\\" or Russia-supported separatists. After the delivery of an IntCen classified report by the end of January 2015, the official EU documents started labelling them openly as \\"Russian troops in Ukraine\\". A 2015 paper released by the Royal United Services Institute and a 2017 report by the RAND Corporation document how the conflict evolved from a localised proxy conflict in its early stages to a hybrid war between Russian and Ukraine, and then to a limited conventional war with the August 2014 direct invasion by Russian troops. Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada Oleksandr Turchynov said in June 2014 that he considered the conflict a direct war with Russia. According to Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko, the war will be known in history of Ukraine as the \\"Patriotic War\\".Poroshenko: this war will enter the history as Patriotic. Ukrayinska Pravda. 24 August 2014 According to a VTSIOM survey taken in August 2014, 59% of the Russian citizens polled viewed the war in Donbass as a civil war. Most of those polled said that direct war with Ukraine was either \\"absolutely impossible\\" or \\"extremely unlikely\\". 28% said that such a conflict could happen in the future.

According to Bloomberg News, Tsuneo Tosaka, IDC Japan's Software & Security Research Manager claimed: \\"Baidu provides the service using a cloud server, which means content flows through servers in China\\" and \\"Government-related documents from Japan central ministries and findings from university research institutions are important, so there is a possibility that sensitive information leaks abroad.\\" NISC also suggested not using Google input software and Microsoft input software. Baidu denied the claim and responded that the function aims to improve users' experience and vocabulary habits in the cloud, and \\"the content uploaded to its server does not contain any personal and private information and the only aim of uploading is to improve users' experience\\". It also said that there is no illegal uploading behavior or information leakage risk, as the uploaded information and servers are kept and managed in Japan.

In 2008 she became the youngest woman to climb Mount Everest and in 2009 she joined the Seven Summits Women Team, a team of Nepalese women whose goal is to climb the Seven Summits. Early life Nimdoma Sherpa was born into a poor Sherpa family in a remote Himalayan village in Nepal. At five years old, she began attending school through a school meals program run by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Originally, her parents sent her to school for the opportunity to receive a healthy meal each day, but Nimdoma gradually became a high achiever and she moved to Kathmandu to attend a larger school. When she graduated from high school, she became the first in her family to do so. Mountaineering After finishing high school, Nimdoma joined the First Inclusive Women's Sagarmatha Expedition, an all-female mountaineering team supported by the WFP. In May 2008, all ten team members successfully summited Mount Everest, making 16-year-old Nimdoma the youngest woman to have reached the summit until her record was broken in 2012. Her success on Everest was recounted in a children's book titled Snow Leopard, the Yeti and the Girl Who Climbed Mount Everest, published by the WFP to promote the use of school meals to reduce child hunger. In 2009, Nimdoma and six of her Nepalese Sagarmatha Expedition teammates formed the Seven Summits Women Team, an all-female team whose goal is to climb the Seven Summits, the highest mountains of each continent. In addition to Nimdoma, the team members comprised Shailee Basnet, Pujan Acharya, Maya Gurung, Asha Kumari Singh, Pema Diki and Chunu Shrestha. Having already climbed Mount Everest, the team began their mission in 2010 with successful ascents of Mount Kosciuszko (Australia) and Mount Elbrus (Russia). In March 2013, they joined three Tanzanian women to climb Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) in celebration of International Women's Day. In February 2014, Nimdoma and three other teammates reached the summit of Aconcagua (Argentina), their fifth mountain of the Seven Summits. The team plans to climb Mount McKinley (United States) and Vinson Massif (Antarctica) to complete the challenge by the end of 2015. Nimdoma was one of the founders of Global Inclusive Adventures, a non-governmental organization started by the Seven Summits Women Team, which visits Nepalese schools to talk about their expeditions with the aim of inspiring young children. She is also the face of an advertising campaign for the WFP's School Feeding Program; she has expressed her gratitude to the WFP for \\"open[ing] the door of educational opportunities and help[ing] me to pursue my dream of climbing Everest\\". Stephen Anderson, the director of WFP Japan, has said that \\"Nimdoma is a shining example of what the WFP-supported school feeding programs can achieve by helping give needy children an education and a fighting chance of breaking the vicious cycle of hunger and poverty.\\" See also *List of Mount Everest records *Lhakpa Sherpa *Ming Kipa *Dicky Dolma References 1991 births Living people Sherpa summiters of Mount Everest Sportspeople from Kathmandu People from Dolakha District Nepalese summiters of Mount Everest ","title":"Nimdoma Sherpa"},{"id":"42563875","text":"The 37th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry was a regiment of the East India Company‚Äôs Bengal Army, which had only become a separate regiment in 1824, and was later to become one of the regiments which took part in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at Benares in 1857.

He was briefly Minister of Justice in the French provisional government of 1814 formed after the defeat of Napoleon. He was one of the presidents of the Court of Cassation, a final court of appeal in France. He wrote several major works on jurisprudence. Early years Pierre Paul Nicolas Henrion de Pansey was born on 28 March 1742 in Tr√©veray, Meuse, near to Ligny in Lorraine. He came from a respectable family. He studied law at Pont-√†-Mousson, then moved to Paris in 1762. He was received as an advocate on 10 March 1763, and admitted to the bar in 1767. He continued his studies, becoming expert on feudal laws and jurisprudence. His Trait√© des fiefs, published in 1773, made his reputation as an expert on jurisprudence. Revolution and Empire To avoid the excesses of the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) Henrion returned to Pansey, where his family held property. He then moved to Joinville, a small neighboring town in the department of Haute- Marne. In 1796 the French Directory named Henrion president of the administration of Haute-Marne, based in Chaumont. Later he was named professor of legislation in the central school of Chaumont. Under the Consulate, the Senate named Henrion to the Court of Cassation in 1800. In the year XIII (1805) he published De la Comp√©tence des Juges de Paix, discussing the new institution of \\"Justice of Peace\\" created by the Constituent Assembly in imitation of the English equivalent. With this work he tried to clarify the role of the justices based on the spirit of the rather obscure applicable laws. In 1809 Henrion was appointed president of the chambre des requ√™tes of the Court of Cassation. In 1810 he issued De l'Autorit√© Judiciaire, a broad work on judicial authority that covered history, functions, issues, relationship to other powers and so on. Napoleon made Henrion a Counselor of State and gave him the title of Baron. Henrion objected that he did not want to leave the Court of Cassation, but Napoleon assured him that he could stay, and he would only be asked to give verbal advice to the emperor. Bourbon Restoration Funerary Monument of Henrion de Pansey at Montparnasse Cemetery in 1839 After the fall of the Empire, the provisional government announced the appointment of commissaires to head the ministries on 3 April 1814. Henrion was given the ministry of Justice. As minister he released citizens who had been arbitrarily detained in prison, and suppressed the provostal courts and customs tribunes. He held office until 13 May 1814, when King Louis XVIII of France announced the government of the first Bourbon restoration. Louis XVIII named Henrion to his council. Henrion strongly supported the Charter of 1814, which he thought combined the best features of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. During the Hundred Days (20 March to 8 July 1815) when Napoleon returned from exile, Henrion remained at the Court of Cassation. As a result, on the second Bourbon Restoration he was dismissed from his position as Councillor of State in extraordinary service. In 1822 Henrion published du pouvoir municipal et des Biens communaux, exploring the nature of public and private authority. In the years that followed he continued to publish significant works on jurisprudence while presiding over the Court of Cassation. He died in Paris on 23 April 1829, and was buried in the Montparnasse Cemetery.

Under the command of Captain Eric Barry Kenyon Stevens, Pakenham sailed to the Indian Ocean in April 1942 to take part in Operation Ironclad, the amphibious landing to capture of the port of Diego Suarez, at the start of the British campaign to capture the Vichy French-controlled island of Madagascar. Pakenham was then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet based at Alexandria, and took part in Operation Vigorous, a failed attempt to escort a convoy taking supplies to the besieged island of Malta. In August she took part in a diversionary operation during Operation Pedestal, which succeeded in getting several supply ships to Malta despite heavy losses. In October Pakenham was one the ships that attacked and forced to the surface the . Abandoned by her crew, the submarine was boarded by men from and vital codebooks were recovered before she sank. In November and December she took part in two successful convoys to Malta (Operation Stone Age and Operation Portcullis). Pakenham had a series of successes in January 1943. In company with she sank the Italian on the 14th; sank the Italian naval auxiliary Tanaro on the 16th; and along with and the Greek , Pakenham sank the Italian transport ship Stromboli on the 18th. =Sinking= Now under the command of Commander Basil Jones, early on 16 April Pakenham and Paladin engaged the Italian s and , which were the forward escort of a convoy composed of the transport ship Belluno and the torpedo boat , which was carrying aviation fuel for Bizerte in her fore holds. While Belluno and Tifone slipped away, the forward escort fought a short action, in which Cigno was disabled by gunfire, then torpedoed and sunk. Cassiopea limped away badly damaged. However, Pakenham was hit by shell fire six times, disabling her engines and a boiler. Ten members of her crew were killed in action. Paladin attempted to tow her to Malta, but by morning the threat of enemy air attacks forced her to embark Pakenhams crew, and then sank her by torpedo southwest of Sicily at position .

It lies just south of a bend in Page Road in southern Dublin, where Stanley Brook runs east-west along the south side of the road. In c. 1768 Samuel Twitchell, Dublin's second settler, built a sawmill that used Stanley Brook as its power source. This mill was the second established in what is now Dublin, after that of Eli Morse. It was used until the mid-19th century, and now only its foundations remain. The farmhouse of Samuel Moore was built in a glen on the south side of the brook c. 1812, and was a vernacular Cape style farmhouse. The farm was purchased in 1935 by William and Katherine Mitchell Jackson, and the house was moved about to the top of a rise where it has commanding views of Mount Monadnock. The house was restored and enlarged under the guidance of architects Bradley & Church and again renovated in 1951.

The first COMBINE meeting was organised by Igor Goryanin and held at the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics in October 2010. The final session of the meeting was followed by an event marking the 10th anniversary of SBML. COMBINE meetings have been held annually since; COMBINE 2014 was organised by the University of Southern California and COMBINE 2015 will be organised by the group of Chris Myers at the University of Utah. Representation formats The COMBINE initiative aims to coordinate the development of community standards and formats for computational modelling, particularly in systems biology. In doing so, it is expected a set of complementary but non-overlapping standards will be developed, covering all aspects of computational modelling in all areas of biology. The major representation formats covered by COMBINE activity are the BioPAX standards language, SBGN, SBML and the SED-ML and CellML markup languages.

The party was first registered in June 2012 but remained inactive until it was launched in October 2013 by sole party leader Mike Nattrass, a disaffected member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). It had no official political representation at the time of its dissolution in November 2017, but previously had one Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and three Councillors, all of whom were once members of UKIP. Nattrass' deselection as a UKIP candidate in August 2013 saw him voluntarily leave the party and after deliberation, launch his own group whilst still an MEP. The party's name changed twice subsequently, largely due to the potential of voters mistaking it with UKIP; use of the word \\"Independence\\" in both parties' names proved particularly contentious, prompting two separate investigations by the Electoral Commission. Virtually all commentators dismissed the party as a means for disgruntled former UKIP members to confuse the electorate and split their previous party's support, an allegation Independence from Europe denied. This is despite the party costing UKIP between one and three seats at the 2014 European Parliament election, for which Nattrass' group is perhaps best known. Collecting 1.49% of the national vote, it proved to be their most successful election, although the party never had a candidate elected to any office. It shared a similar right-wing policy platform with UKIP, with Nattrass stating as such amid the party's launch. Key policies included withdrawing the UK from the European Union (EU), prioritising relations with the Commonwealth of Nations and introducing more stringent measures on immigration. It further supported widespread use of referenda, promoting English devolution and abolishing the National Assembly for Wales. Nattrass placed his party to the left of UKIP, however, due to both the party's general opposition to privatisation and its proposed nationalisation of targeted infrastructure and amenities.  History  = Background and formation = Founder and sole party leader, Mike Nattrass Before establishing the party, Mike Nattrass had long been involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the right-wing New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single- issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election.Wells, Anthony Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically as to whether the British population wanted to be part of a federal Europe or a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009. Nattrass failed a candidacy assessment in August 2013 and was duly deselected as UKIP candidate for the 2014 election, prompting him to initiate unsuccessful legal action against the party.Walker, Jonathan He duly left UKIP and was in talks with the English Democrats, but cancelled plans to ally with them after they prematurely announced his joining the party. Nattrass, still a Member of the European Parliament (MEP), instead launched his own party after considering a career as an independent. An Independence Party's creation was announced in October 2013,Edwards, Tom being renamed An Independence from Europe on 7 March 2014 to avoid confusion with UKIP. Nattrass had previously considered the label 4 A Referendum.Reid, Les Electoral Commission records show that he had registered his own party significantly earlier, on 20 June 2012. From this date, he had also been filing financial statements for the fledgling, albeit inactive, organisation. The new party's development benefited from an incident in September 2013 when a Lincolnshire County Councillor, Chris Pain, was expelled from UKIP over an internal controversy. Fellow UKIP Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver supported Pain's innocence and were also expelled from the party for plotting to form a breakaway faction. All three became members of Nattrass' party and proceeded to represent their wards accordingly. = European Parliament election and controversy = An Independence from Europe fielded 60 candidates in the 2014 European Parliament election, proposing representatives for each of England's nine constituencies. The most notable of whom were Nattrass, who sought re-election in the West Midlands, and Laurence Stassen, a Dutch MEP who had recently left the Party for Freedom (PVV) and was vying for election in the South East England region. Stassen's unusual standing for the party \\"demonstrate[d] the extent to which MEPs whose true ambition is to remain in the European Parliament will go in order to remain in their seat\\" according to political scientist William T. Daniel. The party did not stand candidates in the Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland constituencies. Campaigning for the election included a nationwide party political broadcast through the BBC on 8 May and Nattrass' appearance on Daily Politics, where he was interviewed by Andrew Neil on 14 May. Despite claiming it would receive more than 10% of the national vote and elect up to four MEPs, the party only collected 1.49% (235,124 ballots) and all candidates were defeated. Finishing seventh, it was the highest placed party not to elect an MEP; it polled more votes than the British National Party (BNP), which was defending two seats. Nigel Farage (pictured) claimed the party was \\"given the green light to dupe voters\\" by the Electoral Commission. Previously, pressure had come from UKIP for the party to change its name and official tagline, 'UK Independence Now', believing it was a strategy to split their vote.Hope, Christopher Henley, Peter This, in addition to the use of 'An' at the beginning of the party name, placing them highest alphabetically on the ballot paper, prompted an investigation by the Electoral Commission at the request of UKIP. Nattrass remarked \\"UKIP does not have sole right to the word independence\\" and the Commission soon dismissed the complaint. Notwithstanding, UKIP claimed the party's similar name unfairly cost them a seat in South West England to the benefit of the Green Party, with Nattrass' group acquiring around 23,000 votes in the region.Elgot, Jessica UKIP's then- leader Nigel Farage later complained \\"[a]llowing Nattrass to launch a party with that name was shocking and showed the absolute contempt that the establishment have for us ... they were given the green light to dupe voters.\\" Political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Caitlin Milazzo concur, calling it \\"a deliberate attempt to confuse voters and damage Nattrass's old party.\\" The party's credibility was further attacked by commentators reporting the affair; Christopher Hope of The Daily Telegraph dismissed the group as being \\"set up late last year to confuse voters who were trying to back Ukip\\". Journalist Donal Blaney further labelled them \\"hitherto unheard-of\\" outside the incident. Blaney also invokes Mike Smithson's opinion that if UKIP had acquired the minor party's overall vote share, it would have won two additional seats; Farage posited \\"some think it cost us three.\\" In response to the incident, citing his deselection, Nattrass retorted \\"[d]id [Farage] expect me just to melt away? No, I am going down with my flag.\\" A second review by the Commission found the name was unsuitable and the party became Independence from Europe on 23 February 2015, in time for that year's general election. = Domestic elections and downfall = At the 2015 general election, the party contested five constituencies, despite previously indicating it would vie for ten. These were the Lincolnshire seats of Boston and Skegness and Brigg and Goole alongside the West Midlands seats of Meriden and Solihull; additionally contested was Cheadle, a constituency in Greater Manchester. Nattrass once again appeared on Daily Politics, interviewed by Jo Coburn on 1 April. No candidates were elected and the party accumulated a negligible vote share. Local elections in the same year saw the party unsuccessfully contest eight wards on East Lindsey District Council, with an additional candidate failing in his bid for election to Leicester City Council. The following year's local elections saw the party field a candidate for Exeter City Council, who was comfortably defeated. A day later, the party contested a local by-election for Croydon London Borough Council triggered by the resignation of Emily Benn; the party finished second last, above Winston McKenzie of the English Democrats.Davies, Gareth Independence from Europe failed to field any candidates in the 2017 local elections; incumbent Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver did not seek re-election and Chris Pain defected to the Lincolnshire Independents,Pidluznyj, Stefan leaving the party with no official political representation. The party did not contest any constituencies at the 2017 general election. It was \\"statutorily deregistered\\" by the Electoral Commission on 2 November of that year. Ideology and policies Little to no academic commentary has been conducted with regard to the party's ideology. Upon its launch in 2013, Nattrass implied \\"it will have similar right wing ideals as UKIP\\", only to assert a year later that \\"we are not the same, we are to the left of UKIP.\\" He subsequently repeated the line in 2015. Aside from any ideological reason, the party was founded out of a general disaffection with UKIP's management, particularly leader Nigel Farage and Party Chairman Steve Crowther, who left members feeling \\"dictated to\\". That said, the party stated in 2014 that some UKIP MEPs were frustrated at the party's 2009 effort in creating, and embracing, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD) group in the European Parliament. Right-wing populist in ideology,Maggini, Nicola Nattrass labelled EFD as \\"probably obnoxious\\" and temporarily left the group whilst an MEP. Despite calling Farage a \\"totalitarian\\",Mason, Rowena Nattrass maintained \\"I support the principles UKIP stands for\\"Walker, Jonathan whilst protesting his deselection in court. The party claimed to advocate a society comprising \\"[p]ersonal freedom with personal responsibility\\", supported by what it saw as \\"traditional commonsense policies\\". =Constitutional and legislative policy= The party favoured the abolition of the National Assembly for Wales (pictured). Independence from Europe's primary policy was to guarantee that the United Kingdom left the European Union (EU). This included its legal accessories, promising a withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The party advocated the increased use of direct democracy, namely through referenda. Petitions with support from more than 5% of the electorate would trigger a national referendum on a respective issue, with the outcome legally binding by default. Conversely, Nattrass stated in 2014 that his party was adverse to the idea of a nationwide vote on the UK's membership of the EU, calling for \\"MPs with backbone\\" to ensure a departure was delivered. The party advocated sweeping reforms of the UK's legislative process. These included a reduction of the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons by one third (650 to 430) and the replacement of the House of Lords with an elected upper chamber. Scheduled debates would have been introduced, upon which members for Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh constituencies would return to their devolved legislatures, leaving the UK Parliament to discuss English affairs exclusively. The party repeatedly advocated the abolition of the National Assembly for Wales, however, at one time adopting the tagline 'Abolish Assembly and leave European Union'; it suggested a referendum be held in Wales over the matter. Devolved legislatures' membership would have no longer consisted of politicians elected specifically to those chambers (i.e. MLAs, MSPs or AMs), but would have instead comprised those UK MPs returning routinely from the national parliament. On an individual basis, MPs would have been paid and claimed expenses in-line with existing British civil service guidelines. If elected, the party claimed it would \\"[b]uild a condominium to house MP's whilst they reside in London\\" and scrap their second home allowances. Legislators would have been accountable by way of an 'Independent Politicians Complaints Commission', with its members chosen by designated non- governmental organisations (NGOs). Furthermore, the activities of political parties would have faced greater regulation; whips would have been removed from the select committee appointment process and party sanctioning against rebellious MPs disallowed. =Economic policy= The party claimed that by disowning tariffs and restrictions imposed by the European Union Customs Union (EUCU) the UK could focus on adopting amicable free trade with the Commonwealth of Nations. The party would have further sought to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from EU member states, as well as attempted to lower Council Tax by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's Landfill Directive. Independence from Europe claimed that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt could have been cleared. Domestic budgetary policies included the raising of personal allowance to ¬£15,000, broad simplification of both personal and corporate tax and opposition to zero-hours contracts. In addition, the party condoned the forced collection of tax from evaders and the nationalisation of private finance initiatives (PFIs). =Energy, environment and transport policy= Scrapping plans for the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway has been described among the party's \\"key policies\\". The party opposed government subsidy of wind turbines and instead proposed the increased use of clean coal technology and nuclear fusion to address the UK's energy shortage. This would have been accompanied by a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hoped would keep consumer costs affordable. The party would also have abandoned catch quotas set by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and established 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful stocks. In transport policy, Independence from Europe was generally skeptical of large-scale developments. BBC News characterised the group's opposition to the construction of the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway as among \\"[i]ts key policies\\"; the group further warned against expansion of London's Standsted and Gatwick airports, as well as the introduction of a third runway at Heathrow. Furthermore, the party sought to abolish toll roads and nationalise UK railway franchises \\"if they fail[ed] in viability or in their contractual obligations.\\" =Foreign, defence and immigration policy= The group sought to re-establish \\"traditional links\\" with the Commonwealth of Nations, believing that the UK had \\"lost invaluable trading links, respect and friendship\\" with the organisation since joining the EU. Independence from Europe twice asserted that the UK misspends foreign aid on countries wealthy enough to fund independent space programs, it suggested such funding should be diverted to support Britain's elderly population. In defence policy, the party pledged to increase the number of armed forces personnel to 200,000 and reduce the number of British troops sent to fight abroad, further encouraging the United Nations (UN) to take more responsibility over international security. Independence from Europe called for stricter immigration policy to be implemented in the UK, but refused to set a statistical migration target. It supported an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK had left the European Economic Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also have faced more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have had to carry identification at all times, as well as resided in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hoped, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme. =Social policy= The party supported the maintenance of Britain's National Health Service (NHS) to be free at the point of delivery and described itself as \\"dead against privatisation\\" of the institution. Whilst reducing bureaucracy in the NHS, the party would also have aimed to invest a further ¬£5 billion to train 40,000 more nurses in addition to 10,000 extra doctors. Free dental and eye treatment would have been restored and foreign visitors would be required to possess private medical insurance during their time in the UK. It sought to return more community services, like the NHS, into public ownership where they had been privatised entirely or in-part, including prisons and the Post Office. It would have reserved the UK's wider welfare system to cater exclusively for British citizens; they would also have limited the amount of tax credits a childless, able-bodied citizen could receive to 80% of the weekly national minimum wage as well as restricted child benefit payments for households with more than two juveniles and/or a combined annual income of over ¬£50,000. Independence from Europe supported and sought to extend tenants' 'Right to Buy' council and housing association properties. To address crime, the party sought to deport foreign offenders, extend neighborhood watch schemes and hold a referendum on restoring capital punishment in the UK. It further pledged to invest ¬£2.5 billion into the police service, promising to recruit 10,000 more officers. In addition, the group would have reformed education policy by aiming to cut school class sizes and scrapping tuition fees for UK students attending British universities; conversely, all foreign students would have been required to pay in full.

There she spent her days and years in total renunciation of the world in order to give honor to God. People believed she received visions from the Lord and her experiences were later documented in Vita Margaretae Contractae.  Early life and seclusion  Margaret was a deformed child, born in the urban society of Magdeburg, the capital of Saxony- Anhalt, Germany, around the time of 1210. Magdeburg was a prosperous city situated on the Elbe River and the seat of an archbishopric. It is unknown what her ailment was but it is strongly suggested that she was born with it. Her family was relatively wealthy, but shunned Margaret and her deformation. She was often seen attending church with a blind servant in her early childhood. Spurned and mocked for her deformity both by her community and family, Margaret found companionship and solace in her relationship with God. She accepted their mockery saying, ‚ÄúWhy do you stand around staring at us? You are merely seeing God‚Äôs martyrs. Don‚Äôt neglect your duties.‚Äù Margaret truly viewed herself as one of God's martyrs and happily endured any suffering sent her way. In 1222, at age twelve Margaret chose to be cloistered as an anchoress to better worship the Lord. Margaret choose to become an anchoress during a time when this lifestyle had hit its peak. The 12th and 13th centuries saw the highest number of women becoming anchoresses. Her mother helped arrange an anchorhold for her in St. Albans Church on Broadway near the Magdeburg Cathedral. Margaret did not choose the community life of a nun but the complete reclusive life devoted entirely to prayer to God. She was enclosed in a small cell in the church that had only two small windows. One faced the church and altar allowing her to partake in ceremonies. The other window is covered with dark cloth but allowed her to speak with those who came to her cell seeking advice, which many people sought from this anchoress. Sometime in her early enclosure she learned to read. Her Vita claims that she believed she was taught by Mary, the Mother of Christ. Her desire to go into the church was not to bring honor and privilege to her family but to give God due glory. She shunned the common practice of charity and showed her devotion through self-emaciation. People often came to her and shared their troubles. Margaret saw her purpose was to teach others about the tenets of Christianity and help their religious self-expression. Margaret's message is that it is suffering and desolation, not sweetness or consolation, that will bring you to God. She had the ear of many people who sympathized with her and viewed her as a saint.  The Life of Margaret the Lame  Two years after Margaret's enclosure when she was 14, the friar Johannes of the Dominican Order came to serve as her confessor. Initially he cared little for her suffering as her beliefs contrasted with his own religious practices. John tried to get her to follow popular ascetic practices such as fasting and sleep deprivation. She obliged for a time, but these methods damaged her already frail health. Soon though he began to understand her beliefs and came to view her as a blessed woman destined to become a saint. Around 1250 Johannes recorded some of her spiritual teachings and practices in a hagiography that is the source of most of our information about her. For a period of three years Johannes refused to see Margaret though she desired to speak to him. He later came to regret this time spent away from her. While Johannes was away Margaret felt as though she were under the tutelage of the Blessed Virgin and Jesus Christ. Often Johannes wrote that Margaret suffered great pains and torment that she believed were sent by God to purify her soul. She often spoke of visions sent to her from Christ through which she outlined her teachings of the basic tenets of Christianity. Margaret's Vita was a rarity in that she was alive while it was being written. Therefore, she was able to tell Johannes what she desired in her Vita. In her Vita Margaret included her teachings of worship and the five things required for prayer. First, pray humbly, as we are not worthy for our prayers to be heard. Second, we must direct our fervent desire to him. Thirdly, pray wisely and ensure that your prayer is not for your consolation, but only to offer God praise, glory and honor. Fourth, pray faithfully. Fifth, you must persevere in prayer.  Leaving Magdeburg  Though she had the ear of many of the people who came to her for guidance, the established clergy in Magdeburg held little trust for Margaret. Clerics grew suspicious of her supposed sufferings that would abruptly end as soon as someone approached her cell seeking counsel. The clergy wanted her to leave and encouraged Johannes to have her removed from her cell. Fearing for her safety, he agreed and arranged for a cell for her in his old Dominican convent. Margaret fiercely protested being removed but understood that the clergy held her in contempt. She finally agreed to be moved to the new Saint-Agnes convent in the nearby community of Neustadt. She remained there for the rest of her life. After her transfer to Neustadt Margaret focused on her prayer and devotion to the Lord, seeing people less often. Johannes did not include any writings of her death in Margaret's Vita. She died sometime after 1245 around the age of 40.

The game was released on 22 April 2014 for both Microsoft Windows and OS X platforms. Fract OSC allows players to explore an abstract landscape that includes puzzles using platforming and music-based game elements. Completing these puzzles creates ambient music that continues to play in the environment and unlocks portions of an in-game music synthesis that allows players to create their own music. The game, originally named \\"Fract,\\" was developed by Richard Flanagan as part of his student work at the University of Montreal and achieved wide interest after winning the Student Showcase award at the 2011 Independent Games Festival and release of a freely available demo. Flanagan brought aboard Quynh Nguyen and Henk Boom to flesh out the game, branding themselves Phosfiend Systems. They received funding help from the Indie Fund to complete the title. The game was originally planned to span several levels, but due to complexity, it was reduced to a single primary level representing a synthetic oscillator, shorted to \\"OSC\\" for the game's final release. Gameplay A puzzle in Fract OSC, here requiring the player to manipulate large cubes to marked areas using the \\"engagement mode\\" interface indicated by the brighter-colored elements. Fract OSC is presented to the player in the first-person view. As a nameless avatar, the player explores the game's world with little guidance besides visual and audio clues. The game begins on an empty space which, as the player discovers while playing the game, is a giant music synthesizer, initially defunct. A portal on this level leads to a game's main world space, the insides of this synthesizer. This world is an abstract landscape, comparable to the visuals of Tron, that includes many large structures along with the unique environmental features. At any time, the player can switch to a special \\"engagement mode\\" view that reveals any special virtual controls in the nearby area that can be used to manipulate the game's world. One feature of the world are a number of travel stations, from which the player can rapidly travel to any other previously-opened station. While the player can fall into a lethal liquid at the base of the world, or be crushed by objects in the game world, they are respawned without penalty near a recent checkpoint they passed. The world is divided roughly into three sectors based on colors, red, green, and blue, representing lead, pad, and bass voices, respectively. In several of the structures are the game's puzzles. The nature of such puzzles are initially abstract but using the engagement mode in proper locations will reveal controls to manipulate these puzzles. There are generally two parts of each puzzle. Within each sector, the first part of these puzzles share a common solution theme, such as manipulating large blocks to specific squares, or routing the flow of sound to a target location. Once this is solved, the player then must set a melody on a smaller synth machine located nearby, as to come up with a rhythm to open up a nearby portal, using visual and audio clues to guess the proper rhythm. Completing both parts of a puzzle unlocks one or more of the larger synthesizer controls in the introductory space, as well as opening up paths in the main world to further explore. Additionally, areas near completed puzzles will emit sound and light effects. Completing all four puzzles within that sector unlocks a larger puzzle for that sector that once solved fully opens up all controls for that synthesizer voice on the main synthesizer. Once all three sectors are completed, the player can complete a final puzzle area that incorporates elements of all previous puzzles to unlock the advanced controls on the main synthesizer and completes the game. At any time, the player can return to the main synthesizer, and using whatever controls they have unlocked, create musical tracks which they can save and share with other users. Development Fract OSC began as a student project by Richard E. Flanagan while at the University of Montreal, working on a post- graduate degree in game design. At the time, Flanagan had named the game Fract, and described it as a \\"boldly styled Myst-like adventure\\", having the player explore an abstract world, resembling Tron-like environments, that incorporated music and sound into its aesthetic. These ideas were based on his idea of combines three very personal interests, \\"early computer culture, adventure games and fundamentals of electronic music\\", and creating a mechanic that users would experience musical elements early in the game and come to understand how to use these later in the game for larger puzzles. Though not a programmer himself, he learned the Unity engine to build out his ideas, making sure that the engine was capable of capturing the visual feel he wanted for the game while scaling back on some of the larger puzzles he had envisioned. After completing his degree, Flanagan continued to work on the game as to create a single playable level that he submitted for the Independent Games Festival Student Showcase ceremony, while providing this level as a free download for others to test garner interest if he should develop the game further. Fract was picked as one of the eight Student Showcase winners at the 2011 Independent Games Festival. Between this award and the demo, Flanagan had put aside plans to work at a local game studio and instead work on building out Fract further. At this point, he brought his wife Quynh Nguyen and programmer Henk Boom on board to help improve on his initial programming attempt. The core game was rebuilt mostly from scratch as to take the initial demo into the larger vision Flanagan had. This initially was to be four larger game worlds, but they realized the scope of this would be too large, and instead scaled back to the single game world of the oscillator, which would be shortened as \\"OSC\\" within the game's title. Part of the redesign was to create a custom sound engine that would be able to take player's input to synthesis ambient music of the world; they found that in developing this engine, this would influence the puzzle design, including creating puzzles that would directly tie into the audio engine. Complications such as this would slow down their development work. Late development was slowed further by other concerns; Flanagan and Nguyen had a child at this time, while Boom had to find work full-time to cover his expenses. After speaking to the Indie Fund team at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, they were able to secure funding to complete the game the following year, allow them to bring Boom back on full-time.

On the pitch, Bendigo had a solid first season in the National Premier Leagues Victoria 1. The Club finished 11th in the 14 team competition with 9 wins, 4 draws and 13 losses. Bendigo grabbed a memorable win against the eventually promoted North Geelong Warriors FC on 3 May 2014, when the Towners beat the Lara-based outfit by three goals to two at Elcho Park. In July 2015, Bendigo City FC's committee resigned after disagreements with parents and members regarding a re-structure of the Club's finances, including the sacking of Technical Director Fab Soncin and the restructure of the Technical Director role from full-time to part-time. The committee was then reinstated 48 hours later at an Extraordinary General Meeting. The role of Technical Director was not filled for the remainder of the 2015 season. The reformed Bendigo City FC based a large number of their senior squad on local players rather than bringing in established players from Melbourne and overseas. Unfortunately for Bendigo, this resulted in a largely difficult campaign in the 2015 National Premier Leagues Victoria 2 West season, managing only six wins and seven draws from 28 games to finish second bottom of the league.http://www.foxsportspulse.com/comp_info.cgi?a=LADDER&compID;=337121&c;=1-10178-0-0-0 One round into the 2016 NPL2 season, City head coach Esteban Quintas quit his post to return to his native home of Spain. Bendigo's season slumped, earning just one win in the opening eight rounds and enduring heavy 2‚Äì7 and 1‚Äì7 defeats to North Geelong Warriors FC and Moreland Zebras FC respectively in Rounds 7 and 8 of the season, the latter their greatest ever defeat in their short life as a club. After another heavy loss, this time a 5‚Äì1 drubbing at the hands of Ballarat Red Devils, Bendigo City announced that Jose Montana Santamarta had been appointed as the club's new senior head coach, assisted by conditioning coach Alenjandro Montano Garcia. Bendigo City finished the season in bottom place on the NPL2 West table, with 4 wins and 3 draws in 28 games. Bendigo appointed Srecko Baresic-Nikic as its new head coach for 2017, replacing the outgoing Jose Santamarta. Round 1 ended with a 5-0 home defeat to Northcote City FC followed by a 7-0 Round 2 home defeat to Moreland Zebras FC, a new record loss for the fledgling club. The appointment of Baresic-Nikic didn't last long, resigning in March after five games, with the side sitting bottom with just single point and 1 goal scored. Bendigo endured two more humiliating 7-0 defeats, to Ballarat City FC in Round 10 and to Box Hill United SC in Round 13. The season ended with a new record loss, losing 9-2 to Whittlesea Ranges FC. Bendigo finished the season in 10th place in NPL2 West, with a record of 0 wins, 2 draws and 26 losses. The team finished with a -105 goal difference. Promotion-relegation between the NPL and the State Leagues below was set to be introduced in 2017 and confirmed in October 2017, when Football Federation Victoria confirmed that Bendigo, along with Richmond SC, who finished bottom of NPL2 East, would be relegated to Victorian State League Division 1 for 2018. The statement also confirmed that Bendigo's juniors would remain in the NPL juniors competition, due to \\"geographical difficulties\\". In January 2018, Bendigo City FC confirmed that it would not be fielding a senior or U20s team in State League 1 for 2018 and would continue as a junior-only NPL club for that season.

It is a free and open community development project. SED-ML Level 1 Version 1, the first version of SED-ML, enables descriptions of time course simulation experiments.  Structure  The SED-ML format is built of five major blocks: * The Model entity is used to reference the models used in the simulation experiment and to define pre-processing procedures on these models before simulation. Models must be in standard representation formats (e.g., SBML, CellML, NeuroML). Examples for pre-processing are, e.g., changing the value of an observable, computing the change of a value using mathematics, or general changes on any XML element of the model representation. * The Simulation entity contains all information about the simulation settings and the steps taken during simulation, e.g., the particular type of simulation and the algorithm used for the execution of the simulation. The simulation algorithm is specified with a Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology term. * The Task entity applies one of the defined simulations with one of the referenced models at a time. * The DataGenerator entity encodes post-processing procedures which need to be applied to the simulation result before output, e.g., normalisation of data. * The Output entity specifies the simulation output, e.g., the particular plots to be shown. More information on the SED-ML structure is available from the SED-ML home page and the reference publication.  History  The idea of developing a standard format for simulation experiment encoding was born at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). In 2007, Dagmar Waltemath and Nicolas Le Nov√®re started to draft such a format during Dagmar's Marie-Curie funded internship in the Computational Neuroscience group at EMBL-EBI. The SED-ML project was first discussed publicly at the 12th SBML Forum Meeting in 2007, in Long Beach (US). The first version of SED-ML was then presented at the \\"Super-hackathon \\"standards and ontologies for Systems Biology\\"\\" in Okinawa in 2008. Back then, the language was called MIASE-ML (in accordance with the MIASE guidelines). In Okinawa, many researchers showed a high interest in the format, and discussions were vital. MIASE became the Minimum Information guideline for simulation experiments. MIASE-ML was renamed into \\"Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language\\" (SED-ML). Level 1 Version 1 of SED-ML officially appeared in March 2011, but SED-ML was presented, discussed and further specified during several community meetings in the years in between, including the combined \\"CellML-SBGN-SBO-BioPAX-MIASE workshop\\" in 2009, or the \\"2010 SBML-BioModels.net Hackathon\\". Since then SED-ML has been developed in collaboration with the communities forming the \\"computational modeling in biology network\\" COMBINE. Besides dedicated sessions at various meetings, the development of SED-ML benefits from community interactions on the SED-ML- discuss mailing list.  SED-ML Community  SED-ML is part of the COmputational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE). Format development is coordinated by an editorial board elected by the community. Discussions take place at SED-ML-discuss.

It is located in Cipanas, West Java, Indonesia near a highway connecting Jakarta and Bandung through Puncak. Located approximately from Jakarta, or about from the city of Cianjur. Cipanas Palace is located in the village of Cipanas in Cianjur Regency, at the foot of Mount Gede and at an altitude of above sea level. The building stands on an area of approximately , with the area of the building approximately . Watercolor Lithography of Cipanas Palace as the residence of Dutch East Indies Governor-generals in 1880 by Josias Cornelis Rappard History The palatial residence was erected by a Dutch landlord named Van Heuts in 1740 during the rule of Governor General Gustaaf Willem van Imhoff. The area's reputation was for clean, fresh and cool mountain air and the building was made into a resort for Dutch Governor Generals. The Cipanas villa (before it became Palace) was also the place where van Imhoff died in 1750, after being sick for two months. His body was buried in Tanah Abang, Jakarta, with a full Military rites. Besides being known as a builder of Buitenzorg Palace, Cisarua hospitals, and villas in Cipanas, Van Imhoff also known for establishing services in Academie de Marine at West Kalibesar, where the building was later named the Red Store. Commissioner General Leonard du Bus de Gisignies also loved to visit the palace for sulfur bathing and brought his secretary Sirardus Willem Carel graaf van Hogendorp (1820-1841). During their administration, Herman Willem Daendels (1808-1811) and Stamford Raffles (1811-1816) employed a few hundred people assigned to work in apple farms, flower gardens or in rice mills, as well as to take care of cows, sheep, and horses. Cipanas Presidential Palace also functioned as family residence of several Governors-General of the Netherlands East-Indies and their families. Among them were Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff and family (1926-1931), Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge (1931), and the last was Alidius Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer shortly before the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies occurred in 1942, where he and his family were then taken as Japanese prisoners and transferred to the Manchurian camp at Hsien in China. Sukarno visited the Cipanas Palace frequently, mainly as a place to find inspiration for his speeches, especially to alert independence on 17 August. The peaceful Cipanas and cool atmosphere was like a magnet that attracted all the ideas stored in the minds of Sukarno to paper. The Cipanas Palace was also the place where Sukarno held his wedding ceremony with Hartini in 1953. In 1954, Sukarno ordered the development of a remote studio in one of the top of the hill nearby the Cipanas Palace as a place to contemplate. Hilltop was chosen because it is a point where people can view Mount Gede in the morning clearly, before the fog then covered the peak. Cipanas Presidential Palace has also been used for important events in the history of Republik Indonesia. On 13 December 1965, the dining Room in main Building was used by Sukarno's cabinet to have a meeting in making decision to change Indonesian money value from 1,000 to Rp 1.00 (Redenomination) during economic administration position held by Finance Minister Frans Seda. In accordance with its function, the palace is not used to receive guests except for certain occasions, such as during the visit of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands to Indonesia in 1971, where she took the time to stop at the palace when visiting Indonesia. On April 14‚Äì17, 1993, Cipanas Palace was also used as a meeting place for Philippine's warring factions on the initiative of President Suharto. Foreign Minister Ali Alatas led negotiations between the Philippine government and the MNLF group (Moro National Liberation Front) led by Nur Misuari. All delegates were staying at Cipanas palace complex. Construction The palace was built originally as a resort place and a stopover during Dutch ruling. The yard is divided into two areas, namely the palace garden area and forest area of the palace. Until 2001, In the palace's forest areas there were 1,334 specimens, 171 species, 132 genus (out of it only 14 are known), and 61 families of flora and fauna identified. Presidential Palace consists of a main building, six pavilions, a special building, and two other buildings, one is as a reservoir of hot spring water and another one as a mosque. Parent building, which is officially called Gedung Induk Istana Kepresidenan Cipanas, stands on an area of . As the name implies, this building is the biggest building when compared to other buildings in the palace complex. The main Building is used by Indonesian President or Vice President and their families for retreat and relaxing. The original structure of the main building was built using Teak wood and enforced with cast iron. In later development, some of the floors and walls renovated with brick and mortar materials, although the renovation of the building's original design eliminates the original stage house concept. The main Building, in accordance with its function, consisting of living room, bedroom, den, powder room, dining room, and back porch. In particular, the living room is on a stage with wooden floor. One of the main building's main hallway wall decorated with a painting by Soejono DS, which painted in 1958. This painting is known by the name Jalanan Seribu Pandang. The name of the painting was perpetuated itself because of its merits, namely that from whichever direction the painting is seen at, the painted eyes appear to see directly to the viewer. Although built gradually, the palace's six pavilions were finally built around the Main Building, precisely in the backyard of the building . These six pavilions named after Wayang characters in Hindu epic Mahabharata: Yudhishthira Pavilion, Bhima Pavilion, Arjuna Pavilion, Nakula Pavilion, Sahadeva Pavilion, and Abhimanyu Pavilion. The first three pavilions were built during Dutch ruling in 1916, while the later three were built in around 1983 during Suharto's presidency. In addition, there are also two other buildings that are named Tumaritis I Pavilion and Tumaritis II Pavilion, which is located slightly apart from the Main Building and the sixth around the pavilion. Bentol building is a unique building located behind the Main Building and much smaller than the Main Building and six pavilions. However, this building stands taller than the other buildings, including the Main Building. This is due to the fact that this building is located on the slope of mountain. The building is a product of two Indonesian architects, R.M. Soedarsono and F. Silaban. At the rear of the Main Building, there are some other buildings. However, the most substantial role to the existence of the Presidential Palace in Cipanas is its mineral hot springs. Therefore, to accommodate the overflow of water from natural sources, two buildings as Bath houses were built. One bath house is devoted for president or vice President and their families, while another larger bath house reserved for other people that accompanied the President or Vice President. Both first and the second bath house are furnished with bath furniture and amenities. Not far from the bath house, there is an open fishing pond. In addition, on the left backyard of main Building there is a mosque named Masjid Baiturrahim as well as several other series of small buildings as office spaces. On the left side of the Main Building there is a Plant nursery used to maintain and develop gardens around the place.

Thomas Morse Farm is (or was) a historic farmhouse on Old Marlborough Road in Dublin, New Hampshire. It is a small 1-1/2 story two-room cottage, similar to other early period Cape style farmhouses in the town and probably built in the late 18th century by one of the town's first settlers. Now a clubhouse for the Dublin Lake Golf Club, it is one of the few buildings from that period to survive. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It appears to have been torn down and replaced by a more modern structure. Description and history The Capt. Thomas Morse Farm house is located in a rural setting west of Dublin Pond, on the north side of Old Marlborough Road near its junction with Old Troy Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade, oriented north toward the road, is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows. The entry is topped by a four-light transom window, and the enter facade is sheltered by a shed-roof porch supported by Ionic columns. A two-story porch extends along the right (east) facade. It stands on the property of the Dublin Lake Golf Club, serving as a clubhouse. The house is a surviving wing of a much larger house built by Dublin's first permanent English settler, Thomas Morse. That house was \\"a two-story mansion\\" according to a local historian, and was probably demolished sometime between 1865, when it was sold out of the Morse family, and 1909, when it was acquired for use by the golf club. The Morse owners of the property include several men active in civic affairs, and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. In 1885 it was acquired by Livingston Stone, one of the pioneers of the summer colony movement in Dublin. He gave it to Louis Amory, who donated it to the Dublin Lake Club for establishment of the golf course.

Product/market fit has been identified as a first step to building a successful venture in which the company meets early adopters, gathers feedback and gauges interest in its product(s). History According to Benchmark Capital co-founder Andy Rachleff, Sequoia Capital founder Don Valentine invented the concept of product-market fit. Venture Capitalist Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz would later popularize the term in the mid-2000's. Andreesen credits Rachleff for the concept, referring to the idea as Rachleff's Corollary of Startup Success: \\"The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit.\\" Marc Andreessen defined the term as follows: ‚ÄúProduct/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.‚Äù Many people interpret product/market fit as creating a so called minimum viable product that addresses and solves a problem or need that exists. Sean Ellis is often associated with popularizing the term. He placed product/market fit as a precondition for effectively scaling marketing for a company in his startup marketing pyramid. Steve Blank referred to the concept of product/market fit as a step in between customer validation (step #2 in his book The Four Steps to the Epiphany) and customer creation (step #3).Blank, Steve and Dorf, Bob (2012). The Startup Owner's Manual, K&S; Ranch (publishers), Blank, Steve (May 2013). Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything, in Harvard Business Review Interpretations Product/market fit might be interpreted in terms of Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas paradigm as comprising value proposition, customer segment, relationship, and channel. Achieving Product/market fit implies these are set without requiring additional changes or pivots. Popular metrics =The 40% rule= One metric for product/market fit is if at least 40% percent of surveyed customers indicate that they would be \\"very disappointed\\" if they no longer have access to a particular product or service. Alternatively, it could be measured by having at least 40% of surveyed customers considering the product or service as \\"must have\\". Sean Ellis is noted for popularizing this heuristic after examining many startups. Rahul Vohra of Superhuman has developed a survey-based model based on the 40% Rule to help post-launch startups test and optimize for this metric! =Analytics metrics= There are five metrics any online business can measure to empirically verify if they achieved Product / Market fit. They are 1. Bounce Rate, 2. Time on Site, 3. Pages per Visit, 4. Returning Visitors, 5. Customer Lifetime Value. Low bounce rates means a visitor's expectation is being met. High Time on Site and Pages per Visit indicate that the experience of the user is satisfactory. High Returning Visitor reflects the lasting impact a product has on their customers, causing them to come back, and Customer Lifetime Value measures the profitability each customer brings to the company. If these 5 metrics are above average and your 40% rule is met, you'll know you have a Product / Market Fit company. =Common mistakes= It is important to differentiate between product/market fit and problem/solution fit when measuring a company's customer base. More specifically, when gauging a customer's desire, companies need to be sure they are measuring desire for the product or service‚Äînot just for a solution. Misinterpreting customers' desire for a solution as desire for a company's product or service will end up being a false positive for product/market fit. Product/market fit is not binary. For a fledgling startup, a minimum degree of product/market fit will not be adequate in order to achieve market traction and success. Rather, what is actually required is a high degree of product/market fit, or extreme product/market fit.

The site, located at the intersection of Carling Avenue and Moodie Drive, consists of 11 interconnected buildings with a total of of space. The property was acquired by Public Works and Government Services Canada from Nortel in December 2010, and houses National Defence Headquarters. During the peak Nortel period of the 1990s, the research and development conducted at the Nortel's Carling Campus was a catalyst for numerous high-tech spin-off and support companies in Ottawa. This development began changing Ottawa's reputation as a government city and the campus even came to represent the city's aspirations of becoming a technology hotbed like Silicon Valley. History Carling Campus in the Nortel days Northern Electric originally acquired the site for their Northern Electric Research and Development Laboratories and built two small research buildings in 1960. In 1971, Bell Canada and Northern Electric combined their R&D; organizations and formed Bell-Northern Research, headquartered at the Carling site. Starting with just 42 engineers, the site was quickly expanded to house 800 people five years later. Nortel assumed a majority share in Bell-Northern Research in 1996, and the site became part of the Nortel R&D; organization. At its peak, the campus had some 10,000 employees, even hosting North America's largest recreational softball league. To accommodate this growth, an expansion project was undertaken in 1997, based on a new campus master plan and an expedited, harmonized development approval process. After Nortel went bankrupt in 2009, its research divisions were sold to Avaya, Ciena, Ericsson, and Genband, while the real property was purchased by Public Works and Government Services Canada for CDN$208 million. The site is intended to become home to 8,500 staff members of the National Defence Headquarters that are scattered across more than 40 different locations across the National Capital Region. The renovations to accommodate the defence personnel are projected to be approximately CDN$506 million, staged over 6 years. In 2013, it was reported that electronic eavesdropping devices were found at the Carling Campus, and that Nortel had been the target of industrial espionage for nearly a decade before its bankruptcy. This security concern even caused DND to reconsider its move to the site, but federal officials later said they never found any bugs during a sweep. Defence personnel began relocating to NDHQ Carling in January 2017. Features Amenities on the site include parks and patios, fitness centre, sports fields, parking for 5,925 cars (including a 480 car parkade), and access to forested lands of the Ottawa Greenbelt.

Until the 16th century it served as a capital of Bishopric of Courland.  History  Remains of the Wall in front of the Pilten Church The tiny tower of the castle known as Schmachturm or Shame Tower due to numerous human remains found on it grounds. As part of the Northern crusades, the region was awarded the Livonian Brothers of the Sword in 1230 in the first Treaty with Curonian King. Between 1242 and 1247, the region was again subjugated by the Teutonic Order into which the Order of the Sword Brothers had merged after the defeat at the Battle of Saule. The eternal peace was established only in 1267, when master of the order Otto von Lutterberg pacified the region and concluded treaty with the Curonians. At the division of Courland the Order received the area on the left bank of Venta (Windau) river and the diocese of Courland the area on the left bank with Pilten. Bishop Edmund von Werd (1263 to 1299) resided in Memel castle, while Amboten castle served him as a residence in northern Kurland. Castle Amboten was left during a temporary absence of the bishop in 1290 the Order of National Defense. Pilten Castle was probably built only after this time, possibly Pilsen Castle was built as the new seat of the bishop, the bishop's chancery and the penman under Emund's successor, Bishop Burchard (1300-1311). The castle itself was first documented in 1309, when the bishop of Kurland was forced to leave his land and fortresses for the rest of his life and leave the country. During the Livonian War the last bishop of Kurland, Johann von M√ºnchhausen, Pilten and the whole monastery 1559 sold to the King of Denmark, who gave it to his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein, who was appointed King of Livonia by Tsar Ivan the Terrible. After a contract of subjugation between the King of Poland and Duke Gotthard Kettler of November 1561, the monastery of Pilten was to reach the Duchy even then. However, the congregations did not want to submit to either Poland or the Kurland dependent on it, but asked King Frederick II of Denmark to protect the monastery. The big tower of the castle was blown up so that it would not serve the Poles as a target during a siege. In the spring of 1583 there was a fierce petty war between Poland and the monastery, with Amboten castle and Neuhausen (Valtaiki) occupied by Poland, while Pilten remained in the hands of the monks. Magnus died on 18 March 1583 at Pilten Castle. The pen was to fall to Poland, which had to pay distance money to the King of Denmark. Since Poland did not have the required sum, Georg Friedrich von Ansbach, the regent of the Duchy of Prussia, paid the money to Denmark and became pledge holder of the abbey with all rights sovereignty. In 1617, the bishopric of Courland came under the rule of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and Castle Hasenpoth became the administrative center. For 1621 is mentioned that the castle Pilten was partially collapsed. In 1710 during the flood Venta river made a shortcut over the riverbank and the old riverbed has been clogged. As a result the fortress ended up 1.5 km away from the river waterways which in turn lead to declining trade. By 1750s the old fortress fell completely out of use and depopulated. In the eighteenth century, the entire region suffered from hostilities between Poles, Swedes and Russians, and local commercial life and economic activity died out completely.  Archaeological excavations  In 1976 - 1977, Latvian archaeologist ƒívalds Mugurƒìviƒçs conducted excavations in the area of Piltene Castle, which revealed fragments of the castle grounds, a ditch and a bridge.  Current status  Some of the fragments of both rounded cannon towers and the few low wall walls of the convent building have been preserved. About half of the tower's height of 6 m has been preserved from a small round tower. http://www.ambermarks.com/PieminekluVeidi/VidPilis/_EVidPilis_Tabula.htm Ambermarks, Medieval castles of Latvia There is also a southern moat in the Venta river valley.

He painted mainly landscapes with putti or mythological scenes in a classicizing style which show the influence of Fran√ßois Duquesnoy and Nicolas Poussin as well as religious paintings. Life The details about Spierincks‚Äô early life and training are sketchy. This also applies to his date of birth. He is usually stated to have been born in Brussels c. 1609-1610. However, he is mentioned as a pupil of Michel de Boerdous in Brussels in 1612 and as a master in the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke in 1622. It is therefore more likely that he was born around 1600. He was in Rome by 1624 and it is believed that he may briefly have been a pupil there of his Flemish compatriot, the landscape painter Paul Bril. An allegorical scene with putti fighting By 1630 Spierincks is documented as sharing a house with the Flemish sculptor Fran√ßois Duquesnoy (1597-1643). The two artists lived together in via della Vittoria near Piazza di Spagna from 1630 until Spierincks‚Äô death in 1639.Carel Philips Spierinck (Brussels c. 1600 ‚Äì 1639 Rome), Putti Teasing a Goat, at Dorotheum Fran√ßois Duquesnoy had previously shared lodgings with Nicolas Poussin. In the period 1634-35 Spierincks was paying dues to the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, though not as a member. He died on 22 May 1639 and was buried near the high altar of Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici, a Roman Catholic church in Vatican City. Work The work of Spierincks can be divided by subject matter into mythological and religious paintings. The two major influences on his style were Poussin and Fran√ßois Duquesnoy.Silvia Danesi Squarzina, A 'Hagar and the Angel' by Carel Philips Spierinck in Potsdam, in: The Burlington Magazine, June 1999 (Number 1155 ‚Äì Volume 141) The influence of Duquesnoy can be seen in his Classicist tendencies and the theme of the putti. Poussin had during his first decade in Rome (1624‚Äì34) created a series of mythological landscapes inspired by Titian‚Äôs series on the theme of the Bacchanales (one now in the National Gallery, London, and two in the Prado, Madrid) and on the pastoral love poetry of classical antiquity such as the Eclogues of Virgil. These Poussins are playful and erotic celebrations of the idyllic life of Arcadia but also have a serious undertone.Karel Philips Spierincks (c.1600-39) at the Royal Collection Spierincks was inspired by Poussin's paintings to produce a series of mythological paintings often depicting putti in a bucolic setting. His work is sometimes confused with that of another follower of Poussin, the Italian painter Andrea de Leone.Miriam Di Penta, 'Due inediti di Andrea de Leone. Nuove riflessioni sul Poussin-castiglione-De Leone Problem', in Storia dell'Arte 125-126. 2010, p. 101 Venus Sleeping, with Satyrs and Cupids Spierincks left incomplete paintings for the sacristy of Santa Maria dell'Anima which he had already started. These paintings have not survived although one of them, a Saint Norbert, was recorded on 2 March 1643 in the house of 'Petrus Piscator' i.e. Peter Visscher (or Pieter de Vischere), an Italian banker and patron of Flemish origin.

The Hungarian name P√°lffy derives from the Latin term Pauli filius (son of Paul), after the first known ancestor of the family.Entry P√°lffy von Erd√∂d (1), in Meyers Gro√ües Konversations-Lexikon (1905) at zeno.org (in German)Entry P√°lffy von Erd√∂d, in 'Pierer's Universal-Lexikon von 1857', at zeno.org (in German) Erd≈ëd is the Hungarian name for Ardud, a town situated in Transylvania. The family crest is of a deer above a wooden wheel which was created supposedly after an incident in the forest. The legend says that members of the P√°lffy family were travelling in a horse-drawn carriage in the forest at night and in the mist when a deer shot out from the forest and hit the side of the carriage, breaking a wheel and killing the deer. The entourage decided to stay there until morning to fix the wheel. When morning arrived and the mist had cleared, they had stopped just before a cliff edge so the family realised that deer had saved their lives. In its honour, the family crest was created. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, the family owned many castles and large residences. It's said that they owned up to 99 castles but never 100 as this would have required their personal contribution to fund the imperial army.

In the 1970s, the Royal Australian Navy's Hydrographic Service was still limited in its ability to survey the vastness of Australia's coastal waters, and was still producing charts on areas where surveying was incomplete or had not even taken place. As a consequence, the RAN began to search for a way of effectively surveying the Australian coastline from the air, which led to the development of the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder system by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, a part of the Australian Department of Defence, with trials beginning in 1977.Slade, in Oldham, 100 Years of the Royal Australian Navy, p. 171 In 1992, a new unit was formed to operate the system, the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder Flight, with the LADS system fitted to a highly modified Fokker F27 aircraft. This aircraft was subsequently replaced in 2009 by a modified Bombardier Dash 8. Operation The LADS Flight was a joint operation between the Australian Hydrographic Service and the Fugro LADS Corporation, part of Fugro a Dutch corporation, which also runs hydrographic operations for the private sector. The aircraft itself was owned by the Fugro LADS Corporation, which also provides the flight crews and system maintenance technicians. Aircraft engineers came from the civilian contractor, Cobham Aviation Services Australia, while the hydrographic specialists are serving members of the RAN. The flight was stationed at Cairns in the far north of Queensland, but could be deployed to other locations for up to three months at a time; the aircraft had an operational endurance of up to seven hours for operations close to its base, reducing to four hours on station at a distance of up to 300 nautical miles. In December 2016, the aircraft deployed to the South Island of New Zealand to assist in surveying the coast following the Kaikoura earthquake.

Having married a Solomon Islander and established her home in the Solomons, she became a naturalised citizen of that country. Her husband is Jimmy \\"Rasta\\" Lusibaea, who was a warlord, one of the leaders of the Malaita Eagle Force, during severe ethnic conflicts in the Solomons in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. After serving time in prison, he went into politics, and was elected to the National Parliament as independent MP for the North Malaita constituency in the 2010 general election, then immediately appointed as Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources in Prime Minister Danny Philip's government. In October 2011, he lost his seat in Parliament and his position in the Cabinet upon being convicted for grievous bodily harm and assaulting a police officer, for events dating back to the interethnic violence a decade earlier. His expulsion from Parliament led to a by-election for his seat, held on 1 August 2012.\\"High Court Rules against Lusibaea\\", Solomon Times, 18 October 2011\\"Former Solomons MP Jimmy Lusibaea Barred From Elections\\", Radio New Zealand International, 25 June 2012 Jimmy Lusibaea asked his reluctant wife to stand in the by-election, essentially to represent him in Parliament in his place. At that stage, there had only ever been one woman elected to Parliament in the country's entire history since its independence from the United Kingdom in 1978: Hilda Kari had been an MP from 1989 to 2001. Jimmy Lusibaea later told the magazine Rep√∫blika that when he had proposed and endorsed his wife as a candidate, he had had to overcome strong prejudice in the constituency against the notion of a woman MP: > \\"Tobaita, the name of our region itself, means men are bigger or more > important than women and this is the mentality of us Tobaitans. I told them > three things: first, that the Westminster system of government is a foreign > concept with a woman, Queen Elizabeth, at its head.

Vika Lusibaea campaigned on a promise to continue her husband's work. Standing as an independent against nine male candidates in the by-election, she won 49.2% of the vote, with more than three times as many votes as her closest competitor.\\"Fijian woman becomes Solomon Islands elected Member of Parliament\\", PINA, 3 August 2012 There was some slight controversy over her victory, critics drawing attention to the fact she was a Fiji-born naturalized citizen, and to her \\"limited literacy skills\\".\\"Second Female Enters Parliament\\", Solomon Times, 6 August 2012 Her husband swiftly announced that he would not allow her to be interviewed by foreign media, informing the media simply that she would apply the same policies as his own.\\"MP Lusibaea Inaccessible to International Media\\", Solomon Times, 30 August 2012 She herself later explained: \\"I only came in so he could continue all the work being done.

It is set in 10th-century Mercia and Dyfed. Plot summary In 911 AD, Uhtred of Bebbanburg's son, also named Uhtred, ambushes a small band of Norse raiders in the north of Mercia and brings the captives and plunder to Aethelflaed, who instructs him to take them to Gloucester, where the Mercian Witan is about to convene. Aethelred, the King of the Mercians and estranged husband of Aethelflaed, is dying after being wounded in a battle at Teotanheale. The Witan is to decide Aethelred's successor, a difficult task as there is no obvious candidate. Eardwulf, whose sister is Aethelred's lover, commands Aethelred's household warriors and is a contender. Another is Edward, King of Wessex, but the Mercians do not wish to be ruled by a foreign king. Uhtred of Bebbanburg, who is seriously, perhaps fatally wounded, knows that Aethelflaed is the best choice, but the Witan will not choose a woman. Instead, Aetheflaed is likely to be consigned to a nunnery after Aethelred's death. Uhtred is puzzled at being summoned to the Witan. However, upon the discovery that Aethelhelm, the most powerful ealdorman in Wessex, is at the meeting, he realises this is a ploy to draw him away from Aethelstan, the son of King Edward's first wife. Aethelhelm wishes the boy to be killed to remove the only serious rival to his own grandson as heir to the throne of Wessex (his daughter being Edward's second wife). The Witan reluctantly seems to settle on Eardwulf. As Eardwulf is not highly born, he will marry Aethelred's daughter. Uhtred pretends to be dying in order to leave without raising suspicion. He races back to his home and Aethelstan. After a fight with some of Aethelhelm's troops, Uhtred sends most of his followers, including Aethelstan, to Chester, while he and his daughter Stiorra go back to Gloucester to prevent Aethelred's daughter from being married to Eardwulf. He then rejoins the rest of his followers. Pursued by a much larger force, they take refuge in an abandoned fort. There Eardwulf demands he surrender Aethelstan. Uhtred refuses, but just before Eardwulf can attack, Aethelflaed arrives, seemingly with hundreds of warriors (though this is a deception), and commands him to return to Gloucester. Eardwulf leaves, but Uhtred knows that Eardwulf's scouts will soon discover that he has been deceived, and prepares a trap. Eardwulf's only chance for the throne is to kill Uhtred and Aethelflaed that night. Uhtred outwits his opponent, and Eardwulf, now an outlaw, flees with only a handful of retainers. Eardwulf's sister, Edith, is captured. Uhtred returns to Gloucester, and he learns than Eardwulf has stolen Aethelred's wealth. With Eardwulf gone, Uhtred reminds the Witan that his mother was a Mercian and that he is Aethelred's closest male relative. To placate the priests, he also \\"converts\\" to Christianity. He is chosen, probably in part because they do not expect him to live long. He then promptly abdicates and names his successor: Aethelflaed. Uhtred believes that he can only be cured if he possesses Ice-Spite, the sword Cnut used to inflict his wound. Edith becomes Uhtred's lover and reveals to him that she knows the location of Ice-Spite. Asser, a monk who hates Uhtred, took the sword to Wales, where he died. Uhtred heads to Wales and encounters Welsh King Hywel. They join forces and rout a Norse raiding party which burned down a monastery, tortured and killed the monks, and took Ice-Spite. Edith uses the sword to drain the pus from Uhtred's body. His pain immediately stops. Uhtred realises that the exiled Eardwulf has joined a Norse fleet from Ireland, led by Sigtryggr. (The Irish are too strong, so the Norse are being driven out.) Eardwulf has joined them. Uhtred correctly guesses they are going to attack Ceaster. Uhtred rushes there and, realising that some of Eardwulf's men have infiltrated the fort, he has them seized. He learns they plan to open one of the gates for Sigtryggr upon seeing a pre-arranged signal. He prepares his own trap. When the Norse army attacks, their mounted warriors ride through the open gate, but find themselves trapped inside (Uhtred had ordered the construction of fortifications around the gate) and are slaughtered. Sigtryggr and a handful of his men manage to flee the killing ground. He then attacks Uhtred, but is distracted by Stiorra, and loses an eye to Uhtred before escaping. The two sides negotiate a settlement. The Norse will abandon another, half-finished fort they had already captured, surrender half their weapons, and sail away the next day, as neither army has enough men to guarantee victory. As part of the bargain, Sigtryggr offers himself as hostage for the night. Also, Eardwulf and his few remaining followers are handed over to Uhtred; as part of Aethelstan's training to be a king, Uhtred has the boy Aethelstan execute him. When Sigtryggr and his fleet prepare to leave, however, Stiorra reveals that she and Sigtryggr have fallen in love at first sight, and she is going with him. Uhtred, seeing the similarities with himself and Gisela, gives her his approval (foiling Aethelflaed's marriage plan for her).

Keith McCoy, writing for Library Journal, summarises highlights of the plot, including continuity from the previous novel, when both Uhtred and Aethelred were wounded, but Aethelred is dying, while Uhtred seeks a missing sword to heal himself and protect two children, and then remarks that \\"Once again, Cornwell perfectly mixes the history and personalities of tenth-century England with several doses of battles, trickery, and treachery.\\" The novel was on The New York Times Best Seller list of Hardcover Fiction in February 2015, entering at number 19.

The Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research was founded in 1957 by Paul H. Nitze, former Secretary of the Navy and Deputy Secretary of Defense; Nitze, a cold war strategist and expert on military power and strategic arms whose roles as negotiator, diplomat and Washington insider spanned the era from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, was also one of the founders of SAIS. The Washington Center, located in Washington, DC, served in effect as a major research division of SAIS. The Center was founded with a grant from the Ford Foundation and survived on further grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Ford, Avalon, Old Dominion and Rockefeller Foundations. One of the earliest university affiliated think-tanks in the United States, The Washington Center spurred the creation of similar centers at other policy schools as well.https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB117426260262440972 = The Foreign Policy Institute (1980‚Äìpresent) = In mid-1980, the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research was replaced by the Foreign Policy Institute with some changes to its structure and output. Many of the programs of the Center were adopted and expanded by the Institute. Some personnel of the Institute were members of the Center. The restructuring included the role of a Chairman, an internationally-known figure who provides prestigious leadership for the Institute. Harold Brown, Secretary of Defense during the Carter administration, became FPI Chairman in July 1984. The responsibilities of the Director of the Center were divided in the Institute between an Executive Director and the Chairman. The current Chairman of The FPI is the Dean of SAIS, Vali Nasr. Among FPI's early programs was its \\"Washington Roundtables,\\" a series of discussions among academics, other foreign policy experts, and practitioners, on foreign policy and security issues facing the United States. In 1984, Senators Richard Lugar and Jake Garn established The Vandenberg Seminars at FPI. These convened members of Congress and senior corporate officials, the executive branch, and academia to discuss the role of Congress in foreign and national security policy. FPI's \\"Washington Briefings,\\" also established in 1984, were aimed at giving foreign journalists from Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America a chance to be briefed by experts on the mechanics of US domestic and foreign policy. During its formative years, the Foreign Policy Institute additionally established discussion groups on religion in the 21st century, Asian security, \\"new sciences,\\" and new technology and international affairs. Regular programming included a \\"Current Issues\\" luncheon group led by former statesman and FPI senior fellow Zbigniew Brzezinski, and an outreach program for the mid-career professionals enrolled in the SAIS Masters of International Public Policy (MIPP). Between 2000 and 2008, the Foreign Policy Institute introduced a number of new initiatives. The Protection Project,http://www.protectionproject.org/ established at Harvard University's John F.

It was originally released by the Daiei Motion Picture Company (later acquired by Kadokawa Pictures). Zatoichi's Revenge is the tenth episode in the 26-part film series devoted to the character of Zatoichi. Plot Zatoichi's travels have finally brought him back to the village where he was trained in the arts of the masseur, nearly ten years ago by his old sensei, Master Hikonoichi. His proximity to his former teacher compels him to pay a visit, only to learn that Hikonoichi was recently killed while traveling, and his daughter Sayo has been sold into prostitution to repay the money lent to her father by local business man Tatsugoro. Zatoichi sets out to free Sayo, only to discover that the entire village is suffering‚Äîvictims of a scheme that has either forced their daughters into prostitution, or into doing the bidding of Tatsugoro, who is working for the corrupt Intendant, Isoda. Sayo provides him with the toggle of a medicine pouch, recovered from her father's hand. While intentionally baiting Hikonoichi's killer by jingling the toggle, Ichi befriends the local Dice Dealer Denroku (the Weasel) and his daughter, Tsuru. The girl's cheerful and idealistic nature reminds him of Sayo. The following day, while Ichi enjoys a profitable run of dice in the gambling house, a R≈çnin that had been observing him since his arrival bets 100 Ry≈ç against Ichi's cane (which he knows to be a sword). When Denroku attempts to cheat, Ichi exposes his sleight of hand‚Äîrevealing that his own bet won. The R≈çnin calmly departs, with a warning that the two of them are not finished. Tatsugoro's men try to balk on paying, but Zatoichi easily overpowers them and takes his winnings from their chest, then tosses a single Ry≈ç coin to the dealer‚Äîa \\"tip\\", to shame him‚Äîand leaves. The men confront Ichi to reclaim the 100 Ry≈ç, but five are killed by Ichi and the survivors flee. Denroku apologizes, explaining that he was instructed to switch the dice, though Zatoichi reveals that he bears him no ill-will, remarking on his own past dealings with Yakuza. Grateful, Denroku explains that the R≈çnin is Koheita Kadokura‚ÄîTatsugoro's chief enforcer. Zatoichi tells Denroku to \\"take good care\\" of his daughter, then leaves‚Äîwith the man performing his dice flourish as a gesture of respect to him. Tatsugoro is outraged at the incident and confronts Kadokura over it. The swordsman reveals Zatoichi's identity to him, theorizing that he's close to tracing Hikonoichi's murder back to them because of the medicine toggle. The arrival of Tax Inspector Jingo Odate panics Tatsugoro and Isoda, who plans to bribe him with 100 Ry≈ç. Kadokura knows Odate‚Äîa respectable Samurai‚Äîand remarks that he cannot be bribed for any sum, then offers to kill both Odate and Zatoichi in exchange for the sum. He intercepts Odate while on horseback to confront Isoda over his fraud and waylays him. He next confronts Zatoichi while drinking sake at the inn, and offers him a drink before demanding he set the time for their battle. Ichi allows him to choose, and Kadokura declares they'll fight at dusk at Utsune Bridge‚Äîwhere he killed Hikonoichi. Tatsugoro uses the losses at the dice hall to extort Denroku‚Äîdemanding that he steal Zatoichi's sword, or hand Tsuru over to him, to be used in the brothel (unaware that she overheard them). Isoda instructs Tatsugoro to rally their men in order to launch a mass attack on Zatoichi, further declaring that they'll frame him for the murder of Odate. Kadokura attacks Zatoichi at the bridge, where he reveals that Intendant Isoda ordered Hikonoichi's death. When he doesn't rise to his feet, Kadokura moves to finish him off, but Zatoichi gets up and wounds him. The swordsman attempts to continue the fight, but is quickly dispatched by Zatoichi. In the village, Tsuru steals Zatoichi's sword and brings it to her father. Denroku, depressed at seeing his influence in the act, gets drunk and staggers about the village in search of Tatsugoro. He arrives at a noodle stand, where he orders more sake and drunkenly bemoans his predicament‚Äîthat the loss of his only child is the same as the loss of a blind man's cane. Zatoichi then reveals himself, in place of the stand's proprietor, and compels Denroku to lead an honest life for Tsuru's sake. With his sword reclaimed, Zatoichi then moves to confront both Tatsugoro and Isoda at the Intendant's home and takes them hostage. With Denroku's help, he destroys the legal bonds used to control the people and redistributes their money to them. Tatsugoro's and Isoda's men ambush Zatoichi and a fight ensues, resulting in dozens of them slain by Ichi. During the confusion, Denroku picks up a discarded sword and‚Äîthanks to his years of perfecting his dice skills‚Äîsurprises himself with his skill in fighting with a katana. Both Tatsugoro and Isoda are killed at the entrance of the brothel, in front of the very women they'd exploited. The next morning, Sayo, Denroku, and Tsuru all meet at Hikonoichi's grave marker, where they discover that Zatoichi has already visited ...

Career LeBlanc won a special election in February 1989 for the state House seat vacated by Kathleen Blanco, the future governor of Louisiana who had been elected in November 1988 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. LeBlanc received 5,705 votes (71.9 percent) to 2,232 (28.1 percent) for the Republican candidate, Leslie Schilling. In that same special election, David Duke had narrowly defeated fellow Republican John S. Treen to fill another legislative vacancy. LeBlanc never again faced an opponent in either party for his District 45 House seat. LeBlanc is the only person in Lafayette Parish to have been elected to five consecutive terms as state representative though he served just a few days of his fifth term. His father, Democrat J. Luke LeBlanc, was elected to four nonconsecutive House terms from 1964 to 1972 and 1976 to 1984. In the two later terms, Jerry Luke LeBlanc was a legislative assistant to his father. LeBlanc is the first House member in state history to have chaired the Louisiana Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget. As chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, LeBlanc sponsored legislation in 1996 that established performance-based budgeting, a method designed to gauge the value produced by public services and programs. In 1996 and 1996, Representative LeBlanc was rated 70 percent by the Christian Coalition. In 1998, he was ranked 44 percent by the AFL-CIO. In 2001, he was scored 25 percent by Planned Parenthood and 33 percent by the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2003, he was rated 83 percent by the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, compared to 93 percent in 2001. LeBlanc resigned from the state House in January 2004, when Governor Blanco appointed him as commissioner of administration. With the close of the Blanco administration in 2008, LeBlanc was named the interim vice president for administration and finance at ULL, formerly the University of Southwestern Louisiana, at a starting salary of $212,000, high by Louisiana standards. He continued as the permanent vice president for administration and finance. LeBlanc received a bachelor's degree in business from ULL and formerly worked in Lafayette as a real estate appraiser while he was a legislator. In 2005, as the commissioner of administration, LeBlanc was named \\"Public Official of the Year\\" by the magazine Governing: The States and the Localities. In 2011, LeBlanc, who had switched his party label to Independent, considered running for the Louisiana State Senate for the seat vacated by the term-limited Republican Michael J. Michot of Lafayette. He ultimately decided that his work at ULL would not permit time away for Senate business, and he did not contest the position, which was won by the Republican State Representative Page Cortez.

It was discovered on 25 August 2003, by American astronomer Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo Observatory in northern Chile. A study of Manw√´'s light curve in 2019 suggests that it may be a contact binary object.  Discovery and naming  Manw√´ was discovered on 25 August 2003 by M. W. Buie at Cerro Tololo as a part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey. The object was named after Manw√´, the fictional king of the Valar in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. Manw√´ is foremost among the great spirits who rule the world. Manw√´ takes special responsibility for the air and winds. Thorondor is the Lord of Eagles in the First Age in Tolkien's writing.  Physical properties  Manw√´ has significant and irregular photometric variability, demonstrating that its components are not tidally locked. The surfaces of Manw√´ and Thorondor appear to be very red. The composition of Manw√´ is unknown but likely to be mostly ice, because the nominal density (with large uncertainty) is less than that of water. At least one other Kuiper belt object, , has been found with a density of less than 1 g/cm3, which implies an object made mostly of ice with a low rock fraction and high porosity.  Orbit  Manw√´ orbits the Sun at an average distance of about , taking 289 years to complete a full orbit. Manw√´ has a low orbital inclination of 2.6 degrees. Its orbit is elongated, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.11. Due to its eccentric orbit, Manw√´'s distance from the Sun varies over the course of its orbit, approaching 38.9 AU at perihelion and 48.6 AU at aphelion.  Satellite  = Physical characteristics = Being part of a binary system, Manw√´ has one known companion named Thorondor, formally designated (385446) Manw√´ I Thorondor. It is estimated to be about two-thirds the size of the primary, approximately for a volume equivalent diameter. The rotation period of Thorondor is uncertain, though a best-fit model suggests a very slow rotation period of 309.3 days. Thorondor's rotation is expected to be chaotic like Pluto's smaller moons, as a result of gravitational torquing by Manw√´ over the course of their eccentric mutual orbit. Thorondor's light curve has considerable photometric variability, with the relative magnitude of the two objects measured variously from 0.6‚Äì2.1 over the course of a few years. This implies that Thorondor could have a very flattened shape, akin to the larger lobe of the contact binary Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth. Assuming a ellipsoid shape for Thorondor, a best-fit model for its shape suggests the aspect ratios of a/c = 7.33 and b/c = 6.67. = Orbit = The satellite's orbit has the following parameters: semi-major-axis, ; period, ; eccentricity, ; and inclination, The total system mass is about 1.94 kg.  Mutual events  Manw√´ and Thorondor were expected to go through a period of mutual occultations and transits from 2014‚Äì2018, where one object crosses in front of the other as seen from Earth. Pluto and Charon went through a similar series of mutual events from 1985‚Äì1990. Observations of these events could allow for better estimates of the radii of the two objects and their densities, as well as possibly determining their shapes and mapping surface color and albedo features. The first event, an inferior occultation, is predicted for 2014 July 16, and they continue until 2018 October 25. The actual observations revealed none of the four predicted occultations, likely due error measuring orbital period of Thorondor, although photometry data gathered during observation campaign have allowed to determine Manw√´ is highly bilobate contact binary, likely surrounded by rapidly orbiting moonlets besides Thorondor.

It is located next to National Highway 20, which runs from Pathankot in Punjab to Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. It is easily accessible from Dharmasala. The nearest airport is Gaggal Airport , alternatively known as Kangra Airport or Dharamsala-Kangra Airport, which is located in Gaggal near Kangra, southwest of Dharamshala. The economy of Shamirpur consists primarily of agriculture and business. History of Kangra This region, commonly known as Dev Bhumi, is believed to be the abode of gods. There is a mention of the Trigarta (Kangra) kingdom in the Sanskrit epic Mahabharata. Sir Lepel Griffin references the Rajput dynasties of the hills, of which the Katochs‚Äô is the oldest. The Mahabharata mentions King Susharama Chandra, who sided with the Kauravas, said to be the founder of this dynasty. At that time, Kangra was supposedly known as Bhim Kot. The reference to the prosperous Kingdom of Trigarta (Kangra) is found in Panani literature. The mention of Kangra (Nagarkot) is also found in the works of Ferishta. In a later period, perhaps that of the Muhammadan invasion, the Katoch princes were driven into the hills where Kangra was one of their main fortresses. In spite of constant invasions, the little Hindu kingdoms (secure within their Himalayan glens) held out against the aggressive Muhammadan power for a long period. In 1009 the riches of the Nagarkot temple attracted the attention of Mahmud of Ghazni, who defeated the Hindu princess at Peshawar, seized the fort of Kangra, and plundered the immense booty of gold, silver and jewels from the shrine. After this time, Kangra does not re-appear in general history until 1360, when the emperor Firoz Tughlak led another force against it. The Raja submitted and was permitted to retain his dominion but the Muhammadans once more plundered the temple. In 1556, Akbar launched an expedition into the hills and occupied the fort of Kangra. Kangra passed to the British at the end of the first Sikh War in 1846 and there were several revolts against them. Ram Singh, a Pathania Rajput, invaded the British garrison at Shahpur. The British immediately rushed their forces, which surrounded Shahpur fort. Ram Singh finding himself at a disadvantageous position sneaked into the nearby forest to rearm himself. After the outbreak of the Mutiny in 1857, some disturbances took place in the Kulu subdivision. Local authorities took precautions; Executing the six ring leaders and imprisoning the others. This became the first overt act of rebellion and effectively subdued the tendency to lawlessness. The disarming of the native troops in the forts of Kangra and Nurpur occurred quietly and without opposition. The national movement in Kangra district was spearheaded by Comrade Ram Chandra, Thakur Panchan Chandra, and Baba Kanshi Ram. Baba Kanshi Ram did a great deal for the liberation movement in Kangra district, where he was responsible for the liberation movement in the hills. He was given the title of \\"Hill Gandhi\\" by Jawahar Lal Nehru for his work and \\"Bulbule Hills\\" for his melodious throat by Sarojini Naidu. With the freedom of British India, Kangra district escaped foreign rule and entered an era of democracy. Artifacts The focal theme of painting in this region is Srinagar (the erotic sentiment). The subjects that were seen in painting exhibit the taste and traits of the lifestyle in society during that period. Bhakti cult was the driving force and the love story of Radha and Krishna was the main source of spiritual experience, which was also the base for the visual expression. Bhagvata Purana and the love poems Gita-Govinda of Jaidev were the most popular subjects dealing with the legends and the amorous plays of Radha and Krishna symbolising the soul's devotion to God. In some miniatures, the blue-god Krishna is seen dancing in the lush woodlands and every maiden's eye are drawn to him. Krishna subjects, known commonly as Krishna-Lila predominate, while the themes of love, inspired by the Nayaks, Nayikas, and Baramasa enjoyed great favour. The sentiment of love remained the inspiration and the central theme of Pahari painting. Kangra paintings Geography Shamirpur is a hilly area surrounded by valleys. The Kangra valley represents a longitudinal trough which is at the foothills of Dhauladhar range. The literal meaning of Dhauladhar is 'The White Peak' whose mean elevation is . The range has a very steep rise and rises above the Kangra valley. The largest but the lesser known of the Himalayan ranges is the Pir Panjal. It branches off the Great Himalayan Range near the bank of the Sutlej.

The book follows the nautical adventures of the title character, a low-born illegitimate child of a captain in the Royal Navy, as he enters service as a midshipman during the Napoleonic Wars and rises through the ranks with the help of his influential father.  Plot  At Madeline Hall, an old mansion-house near Southampton belonging to the wealthy de Versely family, lives an elderly spinster Miss Delmar, the aunt of the earl de Versely and Captain Delmar. Miss Delmar invites Arabella Mason, the daughter of a deceased, well-liked steward to stay with her as a lower-class guest in the house. Captain Delmar is known to visit his aunt at Madeline Hall frequently, accompanied by his valet Ben Keene, who is also a private marine. Captain Delmar eventually suggests that Ben should propose to Arabella, and the two marry in secret, to the frustration of Miss Delmar and Arabella's mother. The captain is able to smooth over the situation with his aunt, even after it is discovered that Arabella was six months pregnant at the time of the marriage. She later gives birth to a boy, who takes the Captain's Christian name and Ben's surname--the titular Percival Keene. The family moves to Chatham, after Ben is ordered back with his detachment. Arabella opens up a successful shop and circulating library below her house, enlisting the help of her mother and sister, Amelia. Percival becomes well known in town from his mischievous pranks on officers and other strangers, often encouraged by his aunt Amelia. However, Percival's mother and grandmother are less fond of his disregard for manners, and insist on sending him to school after an episode in which he bites his grandmother. Percival reports to the school house of Mr. O'Gallagher, a poor Irish scholar, who rules his class with a system of severe corporal punishment. Mr. O'Gallagher routinely bullies Percival by stealing his lunch, leading Percival to seek revenge by poisoning his sandwiches with calomel. On Guy Fawkes Day the schoolteacher confiscates all the schoolboys' fireworks, for which Percival retaliates by setting off the collected fireworks while the teacher sits above them, leading to the total destruction of the schoolhouse and near death of the schoolmaster. When Percival is a young teenager, Captain Delmar reappears and offers him a position aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his illegitimate birth, introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in the appearance of a mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival-- unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity. After his reappearance aboard the ship, Percival gains esteem among the crew and is welcomed back by the emotional Captain Delmar. His reputation continues to grow over the course of his service in conflicts with Dutch and French vessels around the island of Curacao. He also stands in for an ill Captain Delmar in a duel with a French officer, effectively saving the captain's life. At this point, the captain receives news that his older brother has died, making him the new Lord de Versely, and before returning to England he grants Perceval command of his own schooner. After another intense but successful battle with a French war ship, Percival is promoted to captain. During his service in the Navy, Percival still partakes in the merry pranks of his youth, and at one point teams up with a mulatto hotel owner in Cura√ßao to convince his fellow officers they've been poisoned. He also keeps correspondence with Minnie, developing a romance with the beautiful heiress. Near the end of the story, Percival guides his crew through a terrible storm in which many of the crew are killed and the ship is heavily damaged. After being saved by another English vessel, he receives a letter informing him of Lord de Versely's sudden death from heart complications and learns that he has been left all of his personal property. Percival is still disappointed that he can not take his father's name. He later journey's with his friend Bob Cross to Hamburg to reunite with Minnie, but is captured by French troops on the road and sentenced to execution for spying. During a skirmish between the French and the Cossacks, Percival and Cross are able to escape and continue on the road. At the end of the novel, Percival proposes to Minnie, and stands to inherit a great fortune through her father. He also receives a letter from the de Versely attorney letting him know he has been granted the arms and name of Delmar.  Characters  = Major Characters = * Percival Keene: The protagonist and narrator, Percival is the illegitimate son of Captain Delmar.

Genre and Style  As an early nineteenth century adventure novel, Percival Keene splits its focus between concerns of family and social connections and nautical action and seafaring. Percival narrates his story in first person, much like Marryat's stylistically similar Peter Simple, which also focuses on the life of a young midshipman in the Napoleonic Wars. Percival Keene was published a decade after Peter Simple, however, in the second half of Marryat's writing career which many critics regard as his transition into juvenile adventure fiction.Maher, Susan Naramore. ‚ÄúRecasting Crusoe: Frederick Marryat, R.M. Ballantyne and the Nineteenth-Century Robinsonade.‚Äù Children‚Äôs Literature Association Quarterly 13.4 (1988): 169-174. Print. Percival Keene could also be read as a form of bildungsroman novel; there is a great deal of focus on the titular protagonist's education and process of coming-of-age as he matures from age six to eighteen.  Literary Background  Frederick Marryat first entered naval service at age fourteen as a midshipman aboard the Imp√©rieuse, under the command of Lord Thomas Cochrane who may have influenced his writing of Captain Delmar and other characters. He experienced many different skirmishes around Europe during the Napoleonic Wars and was later promoted to lieutenant before eventually being promoted to commander. He developed an influential system of maritime flag signalling known as Marryat's Code, and he was \\"the first important English novelist after Tobias Smollett to make full and amusing use of his varied experience at sea.\\"Frederick Marryat. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Online.  Historical Background  = Napoleonic Wars = The British Royal Navy saw huge growth at the beginning of the nineteenth century during the Napoleonic Wars. During peacetime in the eighteenth century, the number of seamen in the Navy ranged from 12,000-20,000 men. This number grew to almost 150,000 at the peak of the Napoleonic Wars.The Rise of the Royal Navy 1660-1815. The Royal Navy. Online. Through the formidable size of their fleet, the Royal Navy was able to effectively disrupt France's trade outside of the continent--both through blocking shipping routes in the Atlantic and by seizing French colonies. = Piracy and the Slave Trade = The transatlantic slave trade became a lucrative business around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the trade's profits began to attract the interest of pirates. Because of this, many pirates at this time were also slavers. Due to shifting attitudes towards slavery, the British parliament passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807 which abolished the slave trade. They backed this up with another act in 1834 which specified that anyone who offended the 1807 law would be tried under existing British laws against piracy and sentenced to death. Despite the redefinition of slavery as a form of piracy, many Caribbean pirate captains welcomed runaway slaves, who made up \\"as much as one-third of some pirate crews.\\"\\"Piracy.\\" The Royal Navy Museum Library. The Royal Navy National Museum. 2002. http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_piracy.htm The revolts aboard slave ships La Amistad (1839) and Creole (1841) challenged new definitions of piracy. Slave traders were legally defined as pirates but, according to Sarah Ficke, \\"rebellious slaves from the Amistad and Creole were referred to by some newspapers not only as 'murderers' but also as 'pirates.'\\"Ficke, Sarah H. Pirates and Patriots: Citizenship, Race, and the Transatlantic Adventure Novel. Transatlantic Literary Exchanges, 1790-1870. Ed. Hutchings and Wright. Chapter 6. Google e-book. There is no evidence that Marryat knew of the Amistad or Creole, but they were reported on by many British newspapers right around the publication of Percival Keene.  Themes  = British Empire and Nationalism = Imperialism is introduced in the text through the warring of European naval forces over colonial islands in the Caribbean. Specifically Percival explains the battles between English and French forces over Martinique and Pigeon Island. Minnie Vanderwilt's father is an extremely wealthy Dutch merchant living in Cura√ßao, a formerly Dutch colony. Nautical trade of colonial goods, including slaves, is also brought in by the text. Through serving in the British Royal Navy, Percival and his fellow sailors often uphold the value of British Nationalism, displaying animosity towards their French rivals. Marryat as a writer often allows the concerns of British family connections and social status to overshadow the naval action in the text. At one point, Percival explains that his desire to inherit Captain Delmar's name, \\"has been the sole object of my ambition,\\"Marryat, Frederick. Percival Keene. London: H. Colburn, 1842. Print. suggesting that proper social status relating to British identity is key in the novel. = Piracy and Race = Percival's connections to the British Royal Navy frequently lead him to raid and destroy French ships, and the only specific reference to piracy in the novel comes when Percival is taken hostage by a crew of runaway slaves. The pirate crew is described as 'negro' and captain Vincent swears to kill any white sailor whom he captures, burning slave-traders alive and throwing others overboard. Percival is the first white captive that Vincent decides to spare, and the two often seem sympathetic of each other, with Percival going so far as to dye his skin a darker color to please the captain. Vincent makes several connections in the text between race and piracy, mentioning that the black race is branded with the \\"curse of Cain\\" and that, \\"even the white pirates feel the truth of this, or why do they hoist the black flag?\\"Marryat, Frederick. Percival Keene. London: H. Colburn, 1842. Print. Sarah Ficke interprets the pirate episode of Percival Keene as representing the chaos of giving up national identity in favor of a racial identity. \\"By transforming piracy into racial warfare in this novel, Marryat expresses his anxieties about the nature of a national identity that would incorporate ethnic others as legal and political equivalents.\\"Ficke, Sarah H. Pirates and Patriots: Citizenship, Race, and the Transatlantic Adventure Novel. Transatlantic Literary Exchanges, 1790-1870. Ed. Hutchings and Wright. Chapter 6. Google e-book. Other critics suggest that this nationalist relationship between British sailors and black slaves is further explored by Marryat in Peter SimpleLand, Isaac. War, Nationalism, and the British Sailor, 1750-1850. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Ebook.  Critical Reception  Contemporaneous reviewers of Percival Keene noted its similarities to Marryat's other novel Peter Simple, saying that they both relied largely upon the same model. A review in an 1842 edition of Ainsworth's Magazine said \\"the hero is the same preternaturally tricksy, shrewd, successful being‚Äîalways in scrapes, always on Fortune's high way, but never run over by the many untoward circumstances which travel the same road.\\"Ainsworth, William Harrison (ed.). Ainsworth's magazine2 (Jul 1842): 363-364. Other reviewers from the same year were critical of the main character of the novel, with one regarding Percival as \\"a shrewd, knowing, getting-on fellow, with the most selfish disregard for everything below the sun, save his own interests and advancement,\\"Tait's Edinburgh magazine9.106 (Oct 1842): 670-680. and another admitting \\"with all of Capt. Marryat's cleverness, the last of his sea-heroes is not the most engaging. We are amused with the adventures, but care nothing for the principal actor in them.\\"Jerdan, William (ed.). The Literary gazette : A weekly journal of literature, science, and the fine arts 1337 (Sep 3, 1842): 611-613. Some saw the book in a more favorable light, however, noting that it \\"has a vein of humour and pleasantry which, with all its occasional coarseness, one cannot resist, it is full of life, it has one or two capital descriptions, and it is read through before it is laid down.\\"Hunt, Leigh (ed.);Fonblanque, Albany William (ed.);Forster, John (ed.). Examiner 1806 (Sep 10, 1842): 579-579. Marryat's writing was notably enjoyed by many famous later writers, including Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Ernest Hemingway. Critic Mark Spilka has suggested that Percival Keene might have served as inspiration for part of Hemingway's story The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.Spilka, Mark.

He was Thomas Wolfe's last editor and edited Wolfe's three posthumous books. This required considerable editorial work as the manuscripts were not in publishable form at Wolfe's death, but how much credit for the resulting three books devolves to Wolfe, and how much to Aswell, remains a subject of dispute. Aswell was graduated from Harvard University in 1926 and worked as an assistant editor for The Atlantic Monthly and then Harper & Brothers Publishers, where he eventually became editor-in-chief. Aswell persuaded the novelist Thomas Wolfe to sign with Harper & Brothers, and Wolfe turned over his manuscripts to the publisher. After Wolfe‚Äôs death in September 1938, Aswell began editing the manuscripts. The initial development of this was Wolfe's first posthumous novel, The Web and the Rock, published a year later. Two years later You Can't Go Home Again and the short story collection The Hills Beyond were published, also edited by Aswell. Aswell later moved to McGraw-Hill and then to Doubleday & Company, becoming a senior editor. In 1947 Aswell gained significant control over the Thomas Wolfe estate, succeeding Maxwell Perkins. The estate's collection of documents included Wolfe's correspondence. Aswell curated this correspondence and contributed \\"An Introduction to Thomas Wolfe\\" for the abridged Look Homeward, Angel published by the New American Library. Aswell's correspondence with Elizabeth Nowell, Thomas Wolfe's literary agent, was collected in the 1988 book In the Shadow of the Giant.

During the First French Empire he was Director General of Customs, then Minister of Industry and Commerce. Life Jean- Baptiste Collin de Sussy was born in Sainte-Menehould, Marne, on 1 January 1750. He was the son of Pierre Collin de Sussy, Captain-General of the Royal Farms, and of Ursule Petit. He married Louise Millot and they had four children. Collin de Sussy was receiver of customs after 18 Brumaire, year VIII (9 November 1799). He was named prefect of the department of Dr√¥me on 7 March 1800, then of Seine-et-Marne on 28 November 1800. He was then appointed to the Council of State and attached to the Finance section. He was involved in all the important improvements in the customs service. Napoleon noted his administrative ability, and used him for special projects on several occasions. In 1804 at Mainz he liquidated the debts of four departments of the Rhine. In 1805 he proposed to the legislative body a project for the general organization of the customs. He developed the plan, which was adopted, and later improved it. Napoleon appointed him director-general of customs and lifetime member of the Council of State in 1807. Napoleon created the ministry of Ministry of Commerce & Manufacturing to make the ministry of the Interior more manageable. On 15 January 1812 Collin de Sussy was appointed first Minister of Commerce and Manufacturing. Collin left office immediately after the fall of Napoleon in 1814. When the emperor returned from his exile on Elba he confirmed Collin as Minister of State, named him a peer of France and first president of the Court of Accounts. After the Hundred Days he returned to private life until 5 March 1819, when the king named him a peer of the kingdom. Death and legacy Collin died in Paris on 7 July 1826. An 1813 portrait of him by Henri-Fran√ßois Riesener is held in the mus√©e national du ch√¢teau de Versaillles et des Trianons. His eldest son, Vicomte Collin de Sussy, fought with the armies of the Alps and of Italy as an engineer. His younger son, Louis, also fought in the Napoleonic war.

Her studies with experienced teachers had certainly guided her to a successful operatic career, but it had shown her that these methods of instruction also endangered her natural voice. She began searching for new methods of developing the voice, and remained in close contact about this with Rudolf Steiner until his death.

Plot  Pagford is a seemingly idyllic English village with a cobbled market square and ancient abbey, behind the pretty fa√ßade however, is a town at war: rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. Pagford is not what it first seems. At the Parish Council meeting the subject of Sweetlove House and its legacy arises. Howard Mollison, the Chairman, heads up the faction who want to see an end to the legacy; the thorn in his side is Barry Fairbrother, who makes an impassioned speech outlining the importance of the legacy, and the services it provides. For now, Barry has won the argument. When Barry dies suddenly, Pagford is left in shock, and the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the village has yet seen. Three candidates are soon lined up: Miles Mollison, Howard‚Äôs son; Colin Wall, Barry‚Äôs friend; and Simon Price, Barry‚Äôs half-brother. The parish council election approaches and Pagford is on tenterhooks, awaiting the next post from 'The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother'. Samantha decides to give a dinner party for all the warring factions on the parish council. But when Howard and Shirley unexpectedly arrive, the party soon spirals out of control. Across in The Fields, Terri is waking up from the mist of her addiction, on the fragile road to recovery. Krystal begins to hope there might be a future for her family. With the parish council election imminent, tensions rise in Pagford and each side steps up their campaign. Meanwhile, Samantha and Miles‚Äô marriage has reached breaking point.

It was commissioned from The Blair Partnership who represent J. K. Rowling. The series was produced through an independent production company operated by Neil Blair and Rick Senat (who were executive producers of the series), on behalf of The Blair Partnership. The deal was struck following discussions between Blair and BBC One Controller Danny Cohen. J. K. Rowling was to collaborate closely with the project, with the number and length of the episodes then still to be decided. On 12 September 2013, Warner Bros. announced that it will serve as the worldwide TV distributor of the series, except in the United Kingdom. After a year and a half without news on the production itself, casting was announced in June 2014. Filming began in August 2014 in the Gloucestershire towns of Painswick, Bisley, Northleach and Minchinhampton, Dauntsey, and in the city of Bristol and at Archway School. British band Solomon Grey composed the music for the series, which heavily features tracks from their 2015 album Selected Works, along with original songs.  Episodes   Critical reception  The critical response to the opening episode was mostly positive. In a particularly praise-filled review for Digital Spy, Cameron McKewan described the series as having a \\"perfect cast with a biting script\\". He summarised: \\"It's a cracking first instalment for the three-part series with bountiful characters to take in, and the relationships not clearly defined from the outset (rewardingly so)\\" In a review for The Guardian, Stuart Jeffries also gave a positive response, whilst describing the series as \\"The Archers meets Benefit Street\\" Comparing the TV adaptation more positively than the novel itself, Gerard O'Donovan, in a review for The Telegraph, awarded the series opener 4 out of 5 stars. He optimistically summarised: \\"...the performances are uniformly good, the direction is inventive, and there's an undeniable topicality and panache to this adaptation that convinces you that just around the corner something will pull it all together and make it succeed.\\" Ellen E Jones, writing for The Independent, took a similar approach with review title: \\"JK Rowling's story is a far better drama than it is a book\\" Elsewhere, however, reception to the series opening episode were less favourable. Grace Dent of The Independent said that \\"it was odd to read reports that the show was attacking the middle classes and glorifying 'the noble savage'. It was glaringly clear, to me at least, from Phelps‚Äô script that while Michael Gambon's character Howard Mollison was indeed a terrible snob, we could hardly disagree that the 'feral' kids wiping bogeys down his deli window were spoiling village ambience. These were difficult notions of 'village life' ‚Äì the junkies, the domestic abusers, the shark-like property developers, the upwardly mobiles, [and] the downwardly spiralling\\". She summarised that \\"It must be quite exhausting to feel... lost in a righteous lather over how closet communists [at the BBC] are frittering away your 40p a day.\\"  References   External links  * ‚Äì official website  2015 British television series debuts 2015 British television series endings 2010s British drama television series 2010s British television miniseries BBC television dramas Television shows based on British novels English-language television shows Television shows set in Gloucestershire Television series by Warner Bros.

The current church building, dating from 1595,http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/445744.html stands on the older foundations. A tent-like belfry and large annex were added in 1685. The icon screen dates from the 1740s. The church has gone through more renovations in the 19th century but was restored to its original medieval appearance under the supervision of Leon David in the 1950s. The church forms the nucleus of the Athonite metochion, a Moscow mission of the Rossikon Monastery on Mount Athos.http://www.fund-panteleimon.ru/library/history-monastery/podvorya- russkogo-na-afone-svyato-panteleimonova-monastyrya Future Athonite monks reside there.

Davies House or Davies Mansion, is a mansion owned by Yale University in the Prospect Hill Historic District of New Haven, Connecticut. Completed in 1868 and designed by Henry Austin, it was sold to Yale in 1972 and is now home to the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization. When built, the square foot mansion was the largest single- family home in New Haven. It 1947, it was converted into the home of the new Culinary Institute of America, but fell into disuse for four decades after being acquired by Yale. Considering it the best example of Second French Empire Revival architecture in the city, preservationists and students stopped the university from demolishing it in the 1990s. In 2002, the building was extensively renovated and put back into use. History The earliest residences in the Prospect Hill neighborhood were built in the 1860s, when Oliver Winchester, Othneil Marsh, and John M. Davies all built mansions on the same block north of Edwards Street. Winchester, founder of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company located just down the hill, was the first to complete his mansion, an Italian villa designed by Henry Austin, which was later replaced by the Sterling Divinity Quadrangle. In 1867, Davies acquired seven acres to its south and commissioned Austin to design a second mansion at the highest point on the hill. An 1885 home was then completed to the mansion's south, later occupied by William Howard Taft after his term as President of the United States. When Davies died in 1874, the property passed to his wife, Alice, then to Thomas Wallace, Jr. in 1911, who redecorated much of the interior. Davies House as the main building of the Culinary Institute of America in 1964 The Davies House became an academic building when Katharine Angell, wife of Yale President James Rowland Angell, helped establish the Culinary Institute of America in New Haven in 1946. With assistance from Angell and Yale University, the school purchased the Davies estate in 1947 as a facility for culinary instruction, and later purchased the adjoining Taft mansion. However, enrollment in the school quickly outgrew the buildings' capacity. When the institute departed for larger facilities in Hyde Park, New York, Yale acquired the building and grounds through right of first refusal. After its purchase by Yale, the house remained vacant for nearly thirty years. Because of its high maintenance costs, university administrators proposed to demolish the mansion in 1980, but were rebuffed by students and preservationists who fought for its restoration, and the university instead accepted a developer's proposal to convert the mansion to an inn. These plans were never brought to fruition; Davies House was not restored, and some of its interior decor was looted. Already in disrepair, a 1990 fire destroyed much of the interior and upper stories. Although the property had been considered as a location for The Addams Family movie, the fire and university administrators' reluctance to allow access caused its producers to select a Los Angeles location instead. In order to house international initiatives announced in its tercentennial year, Yale began a US$13.5 million renovation of the building in 2000. The university renamed the building after receiving a major gift towards the renovation from Roland Betts. In 2009, a conference center connected to Betts House via an enclosed arcade was completed, designed by the firm of Robert A. M. Stern. Building Henry Austin, the primary architect for the building, is known for his revivalist mansions and public buildings in central New Haven and other New England towns. Betts House, one of his later works, is considered the best example of Second Empire architecture in New Haven. The mansion is a three-story brick structure with a mansard roof and tower. Its massing was substantially similar to Austin's adjoining mansion for Oliver Winchester, though the buildings' interiors and ornamentation differed. The interior of the home was finished with black walnut and carved plaster ceilings, some of which were lost in the 1990 fire. In addition to its bedrooms and kitchen, the house had a library, parlor, dining room, drawing room, and billiard room, and sewing room, which were originally furnished in pinks, blues, and gold.

Ham, founder and chief executive officer of the Young Earth creationist (YEC) ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG), challenged Nye, a science educator best known for hosting the 1990s television series Bill Nye the Science Guy, to the debate after taking exception to a YouTube video featuring Nye lamenting the refusal of a large segment of the U.S. population to accept evolution. Tickets to the event sold out within minutes, and according to a Christian public relations firm an estimated 3 million people viewed the event live via video streams on the Internet. During the debate, Ham advocated the legitimacy of a YEC model of the universe's origins, while Nye cited observations from a variety of scientific fields to defend the scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old. Many scientists were critical of Nye for accepting Ham's invitation, claiming his participation in the debate gave Ham's views undeserved legitimacy, but two humanist groups - the American Humanist Association and the Center for Inquiry - praised Nye's decision. Scientists, both Christian and non- Christian, generally agreed that Nye won the debate, at least in terms of the science presented, although they debated how convincing the victory was. Ham later announced that the publicity generated by the debate had spurred fundraising for AiG's planned Ark Encounter theme park, allowing the ministry to begin construction. Both Ham and Nye have since released books on the debate. Background Bill Nye On August 23, 2012, the Internet forum Big Think posted a video entitled \\"Creationism is Not Appropriate for Children\\" on YouTube. The video featured Bill Nye, best known for hosting the children's educational television program Bill Nye the Science Guy during the 1990s, lamenting that a significant portion of the U.S. population does not believe in evolution, asserting that this disbelief has a detrimental impact on science education in the U.S., and encouraging parents who have doubts about evolution not to teach them to their children \\"because we need them.\\" In a follow-up interview with the Associated Press, Nye said, \\"If we raise a generation of students who don't believe in the process of science, who think everything that we've come to know about nature and the universe can be dismissed by a few sentences translated into English from some ancient text, you're not going to continue to innovate.\\" By September 2012, the Associated Press reported that Nye's video had been viewed 4.6 million times and garnered 186,000 comments. Ken Ham Days after the Nye video was posted, the YEC ministry Answers in Genesis (AiG) posted a video response featuring AiG scientists David Menton and Georgia Purdom. AiG founder and executive director Ken Ham also objected to the claims in Nye's video in a post on his blog, Answers with Ken Ham. Soon after, Ham began trying to convince Nye to visit AiG's Creation Museum in Petersburg, Kentucky, which presents a YEC viewpoint that the Earth was created by the God of the Bible approximately 6,000 years ago and dinosaurs and humans once co-existed, based on a literal reading of the book of Genesis, in contrast to the scientific consensus that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old and the existence of dinosaurs and humans is separated by about 60 million years. On January 2, 2014, Ham announced on his Facebook page that Nye had accepted his invitation to a debate at the museum. AiG agreed to pay Nye's travel expenses, and the date - February 4, 2014 - was close to one of Nye's previously-scheduled speaking engagements at Kentucky's Murray State University. In an AiG press release, Ham commented that \\"having the opportunity to hold a cordial but spirited debate with such a well-known personality who is admired by so many young people will help bring the creation-evolution issue to the attention of many more people, including youngsters.\\" Of Ham and AiG, Nye said, \\"This guy and his beliefs are in their midst, and we can't have this way of thinking for our science students, to have people like this organization try to insinuate themselves in our schools is not appropriate and a formula for a darker future.\\" Nye told the Associated Press that he didn't mind holding the debate at the Creation Museum: \\"It either makes me anxious, or it's an opportunity to influence that many more people and, frankly, have that much more fun.\\" Many in the scientific community were critical of Nye's decision to participate in the event, claiming it lent undue credibility to the creationist worldview. The Biologos Foundation, an organization promoting the compatibility of science and religion, released a statement advocating evolutionary creation, maintaining the position \\"that you don't have to choose. You don't have to give up Christian faith in order to accept the best, most compelling science. We expect that we'll agree with most of what Bill Nye will say about the science of evolution. Fossils, genetics, and other disciplines give compelling evidence that all life on earth is related and developed over a very long time through natural processes. But we're also brothers and sisters in Christ with Ken Ham. We believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that he died for our sins and rose from the dead, and that the Bible is the authoritative word of God.\\" Others expressed concern that Nye's relative lack of familiarity with evolution - his formal training is in mechanical engineering - and inexperience in debates might lead some to conclude that Ham won the debate. \\"I am by no means an expert on most of this,\\" Nye later admitted, but added, \\"In this situation, our skeptical arguments are not the stuff of Ph.Ds. It's elementary science and common sense.\\" In preparation for the event, Nye had lunch with scientists who specialize in evolutionary theory and traveled to Oakland, California, to meet with the staff of National Center for Science Education (NCSE), an advocacy group for teaching evolution. In an op-ed for CNN, Nye answered critics, saying, \\"In short, I decided to participate in the debate because I felt it would draw attention to the importance of science education here in the United States.\\" He later conceded that he had underestimated the debate's impact, saying he expected it to draw attention comparable to his scholarly presentations at college campuses. Leaders of two humanist groups - the American Humanist Association (AHA) and the Center for Inquiry - praised Nye's decision to participate in the debate. AHA director of development and communications Maggie Ardiente told The Washington Post, \\"I am looking at statistics and they tell me people like Ken Ham and other creationists are being very effective and that is a serious problem. We can't just ignore that. We have to challenge people like Ken Ham so I support the debate 100 percent.\\" Debbie Goddard, the Center for Inquiry's director of outreach, concurred: \\"If we don't let [creationists'] ideas see the light of day we can't develop the tools to address them. And we don't just need the tools of facts and evidence, but also of understanding their views and compassion for them if we want to be effective at changing their minds.\\" Attendance and viewership Legacy Hall, the site of the debate Tickets to the debate, entitled \\"Is Creation A Viable Model of Origins?\\" and held in the Creation Museum's 900-seat Legacy Hall, went on sale for $25 each on January 6 and sold out within minutes. Creation Museum officials reported that tickets were sold to residents of 29 different states. Ham told The Daily Beast that \\"the ticket sales won't come to half the cost of the debate.\\" Over 70 media credentials were distributed for the event. The debate was streamed live over the Internet at debatelive.org and Google+ Hangouts On Air. Approximately 750,000 computers logged into the live stream. The event was widely discussed on Facebook and Twitter, with commenters frequently employing the hashtag #HamonNye. Approximately 10,000 groups from churches, schools, and colleges informed AiG of their intent to host viewing groups. Christian public relations firm A. Larry Ross Communications estimated that almost 3 million people viewed the event live over the Internet. Immediately after the debate, video footage was made available via YouTube. C-SPAN aired the debate on February 19, 2014. Debate Tom Foreman, a broadcast journalist from CNN, was chosen to moderate the debate. Each man was allowed a five-minute opening statement, followed by a thirty-minute presentation of the evidence for his side; each man was then given five minutes to rebut the other's arguments, and then the floor was opened for questions that the audience had previously submitted on cards. Ham won the coin toss to determine which man delivered his opening statement first. The debate lasted two and a half hours. During his opening statement, Ham declared, \\"I believe science has been hijacked by secularists.\\" He followed up by pointing to several examples of scientists who profess a belief in YEC, most notably Raymond Vahan Damadian, a pioneer in the field of magnetic resonance imaging. Ham also drew a distinction between \\"historical science\\" and \\"observational science\\", a distinction The Christian Science Monitor notes is unique to creation scientists. \\"We observe things in the present, and we're assuming that has always happened in the past,\\" said Ham, adding, \\"You've got a problem, because you weren't there.\\" During his rebuttal, Nye asked, \\"Why should we accept your word for it that natural law changed 3,000 years ago and we have no record of it?\\" Nye cited radiometric dating, ice core data, and the light from distant stars to argue that the Earth must be much older than young Earth creationists like Ham theorize. Ham argued that these various dating methods are untrustworthy because they often give varying ages for the same artifacts. The Genesis flood narrative, which Nye repeatedly referred to as \\"Ken Ham's great flood\\", was a major topic of discussion, with Nye arguing that a boat constructed according to the parameters given for Noah's Ark in the Book of Genesis would not float. Nye also calculated that, if there were 7,000 \\"kinds\\" of animals on the Ark, on average, 11 new species would have had to come into existence every day for the Earth to contain all presently known species. Towards the end of the debate, Ham admitted that nothing would change his mind concerning his views on creationism, whereas Nye acknowledged that, if enough convincing evidence were presented to him, he would change his mind immediately. Reaction No score was kept to declare a winner in the debate. Prior to the event, Ham commented, \\"I don't see it as a debate to win or lose. I don't believe people should go away saying 'Bill Nye won' or 'Ken Ham won.' I want to passionately deal with what I believe, and I want Bill Nye to passionately speak on what he believes.\\" In a letter published in Skeptical Inquirer after the debate, Nye wrote that by \\"a strong majority of accounts, I bested him.\\" Biologist Jerry Coyne wrote that Nye won the debate. Scientists typically stated that Nye won the debate. University of Chicago biologist Jerry Coyne contested Ham's distinction between historical science and observational science: \\"Science based on historical reconstruction, when done properly, is just as valid as science based on direct, real-time observation.\\" While Coyne felt the debate may have given undeserved credibility to the creationist viewpoint, he concluded that, \\"The debate was Ham's to win and he lost. And the debate was Nye's to lose and he won.\\" Science blogger Greg Laden, who had earlier expressed concerns about Nye's lack of evolutionary expertise, believed Nye's victory was as lop-sided as the Seattle Seahawks' victory over the Denver Broncos in the recently played Super Bowl XLVIII. He noted that Nye charmed the \\"evangelical audience\\" with his style, while the NCSE noted that Ham - \\"no mean orator\\", according to the NCSE - \\"sometimes rambled far afield, and [his presentation] often raced by so quickly that it was hard even to know what he was saying\\". Daily Beast writer Michael Schulson, however, used the same Seahawks-Broncos analogy to declare Ham the resounding victor. Although Schulson agreed with Nye's underlying scientific message, and allowed that Nye \\"had his moments,\\" he wrote that \\"it was easy to pick out the smarter man on the stage. Oddly, it was the same man who was arguing that the earth is 6,000 years old.\\" He believed that Ham's simpler presentation made him sound like \\"a reasonable human being\\", while Nye lost his audience by \\"sounding like a clueless geek, even if his points were scientifically valid\\". Evangelical blogger Ezra Byer credited Ham with raising awareness of the Christian message, but felt he failed to provide compelling factual evidence for his beliefs. As partial explanation, Byer noted, \\"As I watched Mr. Ham's mannerisms, you could sense a tremendous Spirit about him. He was gracious and the power of God showed through his life. There were multiple times I believed he could have hammered Nye on some of his inconsistencies but in my opinion chose not to.\\" The Biologos Foundation stated \\"that one of the lasting effects of this debate will be to further alienate Christianity from science in the public consciousness.\\" The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said that the debate \\"drew world attention, once again, on the United States as the home of whacky Christianity.\\" Michael Behe, a biologist at Lehigh University and an advocate of intelligent design, felt that by \\"talking on about the age of the Earth [rather] than on the elegance and complexities of life\\", both Ham and Nye lost the debate. Metropolitan Nicholas of the Greek Orthodox Church, who was trained as a scientist before taking holy orders, also criticized both Nye's and Ham's approach to the debate, saying that \\"Research that is done to challenge God, has the disease of prejudice. Research is done to discover scientific truth. What problem is there with someone wanting to broaden the horizons of their thoughts and knowledge? God is approached better this way. God is not an ideology that we should by all means defend, but we believe in Him because He is Truth. In this sense, even scientific truth reveals Him. If He is still questioned, it is time to find out about Him. A believer who fears scientific research, fears the truth. Perhaps he is a believer who does not believe.\\" On February 27, 2014, Ham announced that the publicity the debate generated for AiG had spurred fundraising for its stalled Ark Encounter project, allowing the first phase of construction - a representation of Noah's Ark estimated to cost $73 million - to begin. Following the announcement, Nye told the Associated Press he hopes the project \\"goes out of business\\", adding \\"If [Ham] builds that ark, it's my strong opinion, it's bad for the commonwealth of Kentucky and bad for scientists based in Kentucky and bad for the U.S. And I'm not joking, bad for the world.\\" See also * A Scientific Support for Darwinism * Rejection of evolution by religious groups * National Center for Science Education * Project Steve * Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation References External links * 2014 in Kentucky 2014 in religion 2014 in science Ham, Ken Boone County, Kentucky Criticism of creationism Scientific debates Events in Kentucky Evolution and religion February 2014 events in the United States Religion in Kentucky Science and technology in Kentucky Young Earth creationism ","title":"Bill Nye‚ÄìKen Ham debate"},{"id":"42565799","title":"List of Ramsar sites in Estonia"},{"id":"42565804","text":"Rita H.

She along with her sister Dehat Bibi are sometimes referred as Tsat'a Kori, literally girl disciples or girl students of Nund Reshi. Behat Bibi and Dehat Bibi were daughters of a Kashmiri Pundit who was a village Patwari by profession and had converted to Islam under the influence of the great Sufi saint. The exalted state of their spirituality, the depth and breadth their knowledge is testified by the fact that the two girls became the only known female Khalifas of Nund Reshi. They are both buried at a village named Zalsu, a few miles from the village of Tsar (Chrar Sharif) in the valley of Kashmir. The two sisters were present at a meeting that took place between Sheikh Noor- Ud-Din and the great proselytizer Saiyed Muhammad Hamadani. The presence of two female disciples in such an important meeting confirms the fact that they were regarded highly by the great Reshi. It is said that when Hamadani saw the physically weak Reshi, he remarked that he (Nund Reshi) should not keep his horse (his body) in such a weak condition. To this the great Reshi replied that to control once \\"nafas\\" (physical needs) was very important because otherwise just like a well-fed horse it could become unmanageable. Dehat Bibi is said to have remarked, \\"Those who have already reached their destination or goal do not need a ride or a whip.\\" To this Saiyed Hamadani is supposed to have asked her, who did she think had reached that goal?

Early years Benjamin Tingley Rogers was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the USA. His father, Samuel Blythe Rogers was the head of a sugar refinery in Philadelphia. His mother was Clara Augusta Dupuy. Rogers was their second son. In 1869 Benjamin‚Äôs father, together with his brother-in-law, Senator Henry Sanford, purchased a sugar plantation in Louisiana. He also built a sugar refinery in New Orleans. Benjamin was a student at the elite Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduation he attended a course at the Standard Refinery Company in Boston to learn sugar chemistry. Benjamin‚Äôs father died in 1883, prompting his family to move to Brooklyn in New York City from New Orleans. Rogers joined the Havemeyers and Elder refinery, considered at the time the most modern sugar plant in the United States. After staying with the company for four years Rogers had mastered the difficult process of sugar boiling. Goes to Montreal In 1889 Rogers was able to bring his dream of starting his own business into reality. While he was in Montreal installing a new filtering system at the Drummond Canada Sugar Refinery owned by George Alexander Drummond, he heard about the opportunities available in western Canada, specifically in Vancouver. Vancouver was the last stop of the Canadian Pacific Railway on the west coast, and Rogers believed the city could be a center of development in Western Canada with an as yet untapped market for processed sugar. Beginning of the British Columbia Sugar Refining Company Rogers‚Äô idea to open a sugar refinery in Vancouver met with overwhelming support. Businessmen in New York, encouraged by the Havemeyers, bought shares in Rogers‚Äô nascent company. Their reputations also lent important legitimacy to the venture. Sugar barrel manufacturer Lowell M. Palmer arranged for Rogers to meet William Cornelius Van Horne, who was the president of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Van Horne was happy to do whatever it took to encourage development at the western terminus of his railway line, so he strongly supported Rogers‚Äô plan. Along with several of his fellow directors of the CPR, including Richard Bladworth Angus, Sir Donald Alexander Smith, Edmund Boyd Osler, and Wilmot Deloui Matthews, Van Horne purchased shares in Rogers‚Äô sugar refinery, which became known as the British Columbia Sugar Refining Company. The BC Sugar refinery Rogers opened the BC refinery in 1890, only four years after the founding of the City of Vancouver. In letter written by Rogers to Vancouver Mayor David Oppenheimer and the city council, dated January 27, 1890, Rogers proposes to build a sugar refinery ‚Äúconstructed of brick in the most substantial manner‚Äù in just eight months. Rogers requested from the city council a grant of $40,000 and rights to water for 15 years, at no charge. The council agreed all of Rogers‚Äô requests, including the payment of $15,525 for the site of the refinery, but they offered him a grant of only $30,000. Also stipulated in the agreement was the requirement by the city that Rogers not hire any Chinese workers. Since the Asian workers were paid less than the white workers, the city believed businesses would show preferential hiring to the Chinese, thus defeating some of the purpose of bringing the business into the city. A hidden poster uncovered from within the walls of the building, dating to 1895 stated \\"Chinese Industry, Coolie Labor or Home Industry, White Labour,\\" it read. \\"Use only sugars refined in our own country.\\" The illustration on the poster was of a Chinese worker lifting sugar for 10 cents a day, and a white worker pushing a wheelbarrow hauling barrels of sugar labeled BC Sugar working for two dollars per day. Rogers agreed not to hire Chinese labor. Raw sugar was imported over sea from Australia, Asia and Central America. Success BC Sugar was highly successful. Rogers became a wealthy man from the enterprise, building two mansions which are landmarks today; Gabriola on Davie Street, and Shannon on Granville. Personal life On June 1, 1892 Rogers married Mary Isabella Angus in Victoria, British Columbia. Angus was born in 1869 and married Rogers after migrating from England to Canada in July, 1885 with her parents. The couple had four sons, who all succeeded Benjamin as presidents of the company after his death. One grandson also was president.

The Junior, often known as F.J.T.A., was made from 1905 until 1909 (or 1910.The Complete Encyclopedia of the Motor Car, 1885 to the Present, by G.N. Georgano, Ebury Press, 1973. page 397. Junior (i); F.J.T.A. Italy, 1905 -1910)  Background  The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); Junior F.J.T.A. - (Fabbrica Junior Torinese d'Automobili); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co- founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal.Lancia, the essentials In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1905 Giovanni also left Ceirano GB & C to found his own company - Fabbrica Junior Torinese d'Automobili, branded as Junior and F.J.T.A. History 1907 Targa Florio - Guido de Martino in a Junior 28/40 from Fabbrica Junior Torinese d'Automobili In 1904 Giovanni Ceirano founded the car manufacturer 'Ceirano Junior & C.' in Turin, but by 1905 he renamed it Fabbrica Junior Torinese d'Automobili. By 1906 he may have left or reduced his interest as he also founded S.C.A.T. (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino), also in Turin. In 1907 the company merged with Officine Turkheimer per Automobill e Velocipedi (O.T.A.V.). Production ceased in 1909 (or 1910) but 'Momo F. & C.', one of the Italian dealers, acquired the stock and sold off the remaining vehicles. Cars Throughout the company's 5-year existence the cars were variously badged as Junior and Junior Ceirano. The range included : * a 9.5 hp single cylinder voiturette, * a 12/14 hp twin cylinder model * a 16/20 hp four cylinder model which resembled the standard Mercedes designs of the period. To wit - the cylinders were cast in two blocks of two cylinders, with side valves, a T-head design and chain drive to the rear wheels. * a 28/40 hp produced from 1907 to 1909. It used a 4-cylinder 8,000cc engine that developed 45 hp, giving a top speed of 100 km / h. It was priced at 11,500 lire for the chassis and it achieved some success in the Targa Florio of 1907 and 1908.

Brain rhythms have origins similar to the electrical activity of the heart. The rhythmic activity varies in frequency and amplitude with age, attention, sleep, and chemical concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, ammonia, and hormones. Chemicals that affect brain functions change brain rhythms in systematic and identifiable ways. As new psychoactive drugs were discovered that changed behavior, the basis for the science of psychopharmacology, the accompanying changes in the rhythms were found to be drug class specific. The measurement of the changes in rhythms became the basis for the science of pharmaco-EEG. Definitions of the changes in EEG rhythms were developed that identified and classified psychoactive drugs, monitored the depth of anesthesia, and evaluated the efficacy of the seizures induced in convulsive therapy (electroshock).  History  The first recordings of electrical activity from the brain were reported from exposed animal brain tissues in the 1870s. In 1929 Hans Berger, a German psychiatrist, reported continuous electrical rhythms from the intact human head using electrodes on the scalp. The continuous electrical activity varied in frequencies and amplitude with drowsiness and sleep, and with mental problem solving. Episodic runs and bursts of high voltage slow frequencies were recorded in patients with epilepsy. In his third report in 1931 Berger recorded changes in the rhythms with cocaine, morphine, scopolamine, and chloroform. Each chemical elicited different frequency and amplitude patterns and different behaviors. The first clinical applications were in identifying the sudden bursts of high voltage slow frequencies during seizures, both spontaneous and induced by the chemical pentylenetetrazol (Metrazol), by electricity in electroshock, and in the coma induced by insulin. When reserpine was studied in 1953, chlorpromazine in 1954, and imipramine in 1957, individual rhythmic patterns were described. The EEG patterns of new psychoactive drugs predicted their clinical activity. By the 1960s, EEG analysis of psychoactive drugs was a feature of the NIMH Early Clinical Drug Evaluation (ECDEU) program that evaluated and identified new psychiatric treatments. Proposed psychoactive drugs developed in chemical laboratories were first tested in animals and then tested in man. The changes in the EEG became the basis for a classification of new drugs. Assessment methods in human volunteers were developed that recorded the changes in the resting subject at different dosages, both on acute single administrations and repeated daily dosing. The observed changes were compared to those for known drugs and predicted their behavioral effects. When no systematic changes were recorded, the agents were considered not to have a clinical use. Dosing schedules were optimized. In patients who failed to respond to prescribed treatments, those who were considered \\"pharmacotherapy resistant,\\" EEG studies showed that the chemicals did not elicit identifiable brain changes. In pre- clinical animal trials EEG recordings were associated the changes with vigilance and motor measures, concluding that the EEG patterns were \\"dissociated,\\" that is, bearing little relationship to the changes in behavior. In human trials, however, when the EEG measures could be related to vigilance, mood, memory, and psychological tests, a theory of \\"association of EEG and behavior\\" developed and sustained pharmaco-EEG studies of new drugs. The technology was applied in anesthesia, identifying the efficacy of individual seizures in convulsive therapy, in studies of sleep patterns, and the relation of evoked potentials to speech and psychological tests. Social changes in attitudes to the ethics of testing drugs and treatments in patients, prisoners, children, and volunteers inhibited the continued development of the science and its abandonment.  Methodology  Polypharmacy and the widespread use of active psychiatric drugs made the study of individual compounds in psychiatric patients difficult. The science then successfully focused on alert male volunteers (since the EEG varied with menstrual cycles in women). Vigilance. The scalp recorded EEG is sensitive to changes in vigilance. Different methods developed to sustain a monitored level of alertness using hand held buzzers that sounded off when the subject relaxed and dozed. Volunteer Baseline and Placebo training. As the EEG is sensitive to anxiety, an initial training session became standard procedure. The baseline recording identified subjects whose records were unique. EEG recording. Different electrode placements were tested. Commonly the recordings were made using the frontal-occipital or the bifrontal leads. Standard EEG amplifiers were used. Quantification and analyses. In the beginning the EEG recordings were made on paper and changes measured visually, scored by ruler and calipers. By the 1960s, electronic analyzers of 10 second epochs measured changes in \\"power.\\" Digital computer methods using period analysis, power spectral density, and amplitude analyses followed. The quantitative changes in mean frequency, mean amplitudes, percent time delta (1‚Äì3 Hz), theta (3.5 - 7.5 Hz), alpha (8-12.5 Hz), beta1 (13‚Äì21 Hz), and beta2 (>21 Hz), and the presence of bursts in 10-second epochs were commonly used to identify patterns. Predictive patterns. The measures related the EEG changes to the common classes of psychoactive drugs‚Äîantidepressant, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, hallucinogen, deliriant, euphoriant, and mood stabilizer being the most frequent. For a time, the pharmaco-EEG profiles of different classes of drugs were actively used to identify active psychotropic agents.  Applications  Psychopharmacology. Pharmaco-EEG studies were economically useful in clinically classifying new agents, dosage ranges and durations of effects, and separating active from inactive substances. The list of successful applications is extensive; some specific examples are the identification of mianserin (GB-94) and doxepin as antidepressants of the imipramine class; of the inactivity of flutroline as a proposed antipsychotic in man despite activity in dogs; and of equivalent EEG activity of the laevo and dextro enantiomers of 6-azamianserin (mirtazapine) despite differences in preclinical trials. Studies of different cannabis formulations (hashish, marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol-‚àÜ-9 extract each showed the same patterns in EEG, cardiovascular, and clinical profiles. Tolerance development was marked in acute administration of cannabis in chronic hashish users. In testing narcotic antagonists (naloxone, cyclazocine) and opioid substitutes (methadone, levomethadyl) in the treatment of opioid dependence, the quantitative EEG experiments showed the efficiency of antagonistic and replacement activity of different dosing schedules. Dose finding trials of naloxone showed no specific CNS effect when administered alone but very effective antagonistic action in opioid dose and overdose. Convulsive therapy. The grandmal seizure is the central event in electroshock (electroconvulsive therapy, ECT) and insulin coma. It was introduced in 1934 and by the 1940s EEG recordings during the treatment showed the classic sequence of epileptic seizure events recognized as the \\"grand mal seizure.\\" In the 1950s, recordings of interseizure records, on days after an induced seizure, showed progressive slowing of mean frequencies and increased amplitudes during the treatment course. These changes were necessary accompaniments of effective courses of treatment‚Äîpatients without progressive slowing failed to recover. In the early 1980s, commercial ECT devices were equipped with a 2-channel EEG recorder that measured the EEG characteristics and duration. The quality of the EEG record became the standard for an \\"effective\\" treatment. The same quantitative measures used in psychopharmacology were established in clinical ECT. Anesthesia. Specialized equipment to monitor ongoing identification of anesthesia stages are common in modern surgical units.  References  History. Fink M. Pharmacoelectroenephalography: A note on its history.

After losing territorial control to Russia, the CRI continued to exist in the form of an insurgent group fighting a guerrilla war against the Russian Military, while some Chechen separatists also carried out attacks against civilians in Russia. The CRI was severely weakened by the conflict with the Russians in the years following, suffering many casualties and defections including the deaths of its successive Presidents, Aslan Maskhadov and Abdul Halim Sadulayev. Following the death of Sadulayev in June 2006, Dokka Umarov was elevated as the next leader of the CRI. =Declaration of Caucasus Emirate= On 7 October 2007, Dokka Umarov, President of Ichkeria, declared the establishment of the Caucasus Emirate, which sought to establish an independent Islamic State in the North Caucasus. At the same time, Umarov abolished the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and in its place announced that it was now a province, or vilayat, of the Emirate.\\"Two years of Imarat Kavkaz: jihad spreads over Russia's south\\", Caucasian Knot, 7 October 2009. =Leadership dispute= In August 2010, a video was posted on the rebel Kavkaz Center website showing Dokku Umarov announcing his resignation as leader of the Caucasus Emirate and announcing Chechen commander Aslanbek Vadalov as his successor. This was followed by another video in the same month showing Umarov retracting the decision. Following these events, several commanders of the Chechen wing of the Caucasus Emirate - Tarkhan Gaziyev, Muhannad, Aslanbek Vadalov and Hussein Gakayev withdrew their oath of loyalty to Umarov. In a video, they also announced Gekayev has been elected the Emir of Chechnya.Grozny Attack Underscores Chechen Insurgents' Military Capabilities, RFE/RL, 25 October 2010Chechen Rebel Field Commanders Renounced Loyalty Oath to Doku Umarov , Jamestown Foundation, 8 October 2010 (UNHCR)Jihadists in Crisis, The Atlantic, 24 November 2010 In July 2011, a sharia court ruled in favour of Umarov and the dissident commanders reaffirmed the loyalty to him. Umarov then announced a reorganisation of the Vilayat into two military sectors, with Aslan Byutukayev being appointed as the head of the newly created Western Sector, and Hussein Gakayev being named as head the eastern sector. =Death of Umarov and defections to ISIL= Following the death of Caucasus Emirate leader Dokka Umarov in 2013, Byutukayev reportedly became the new head of Vilayat Nokhchicho. On 15 May 2014 a video was released online showing Aslan Byutukayev and the district commanders of the insurgency giving an oath of allegiance to the new head of the Caucasus Emirate, Aliaskhab Kebekov. This was the largest meeting of the Chechen insurgents known to have occurred since the 2011 leadership dispute. Despite this, from late 2014 many Chechen mid-level commanders retracted their oath to Kebekov and pledged loyalty to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. In June 2015, Byutukayev announced that he had also pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi.

The Oxford English Dictionary (1971) and Chambers 20th Century Dictionary (1983) give similar definitions The expression has been used at least since the early 18th century, and many putative explanations have been given for the origin of this nickname for the card. Earliest printed references Extract from British Apollo of 1708 In a book printed in London in 1708, The British Apollo, or, Curious amusements for the ingenious, a question is posed: > Q. Why is the Nine of Diamonds called the curse of Scotland? > A. Diamonds as the Ornamental Jewels of a Regnal Crown, imply no more in > the above-nam'd Proverb than a mark of Royalty, for SCOTLAND'S Kings for > many Ages, were observ'd, each Ninth to be a Tyrant, who by Civil Wars, and > all the fatal consequences of intestine discord, plunging the Divided > Kingdom into strange Disorders, gave occasion, in the course of time, to > form the Proverb.. See also (entry for Curse of Scotland). A similar book of 1726 gives the same question and answer, still regarding the question as relating to a proverb. By 1757 the card was described as \\"commonly called the Curse of Scotland\\" with the explanation that the epithet refers to Lord Ormistoune, Lord Justice Clerk from 1692 to 1735, who suppressed the Jacobite rising of 1715 and \\"became universally hated in Scotland\\". (entry for Lord) In 18th-century Scotland, the nine of diamonds was sometimes called the \\"Justice Clerk\\", and was considered to be the most unlucky card in the pack. \\"Pope Joan\\" and 19th century speculation James Mitchell's 1825 Scotsman's Library claimed that the expression originated from the Duke of Monmouth writing orders on such a card before the Battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679). Despite this, in The Spectator, a reviewer of an 1885 book by George Gomme commented that the reviewer had believed that the phrase had started from an order written on a nine of diamonds card by the Duke of Cumberland (\\"Butcher\\" Cumberland) on the eve of the Battle of Culloden (1746). However he went on to remark that the book claims that \\"The curse of Scotland must be something which that nation hates and detests. The Scots held in the utmost detestation the Pope.\\" James Gillray caricature of 1796 showing a 14 year old Georgiana Russell, Duchess of Bedford playing Pope Joan and holding the nine of diamonds In the card game Pope Joan, very popular in the 19th century, is the most powerful card, and it is called the \\"Pope\\". The game is played on a special board on which the middle is marked \\"Pope Joan\\", and it is used in association with this card. The game uses 51 cards ( is excluded, making the , later called the \\"beer card\\", a \\"stop\\") but there is no direct relation with . quoting Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th edition Gomme's book goes on to claim \\"At the game of Pope Joan, the nine of diamonds is Pope; therefore the nine of diamonds is the curse of Scotland\\". The Spectator review considered the claim \\"more cogent in form than in matter\\". quarter. A letter written in response to The Spectator's book review pointed out that the saying was established well before Culloden, and preferred the Pope Joan theory to other explanations. Other explanations given in the letter were: * That the family arms of John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair, the villain of the massacre of Glencoe, include a pattern of nine diamond-shape lozenges; * St Andrew's Cross That \\"curse\\" is a corruption of \\"cross\\" and the nine pips on cards were in the form of a St Andrew's Cross; * That every ninth King of Scotland has been \\"a tyrant and a curse to that country\\"; * That a thief in Mary, Queen of Scots' reign attempted to steal the Crown Jewels and escaped with nine diamonds, causing all Scotland to be taxed for the theft; * That James IV, before the Battle of Flodden, spent time searching for a missing card‚Äîthe nine of diamonds‚Äîtime which would have been better spent in preparing for the battle; * That Mary of Lorraine (others saying James, Duke of York) introduced the game of \\"Comette\\" into Scotland, in which is the winning card, against which many Scottish nobles lost their wealth. (The Spectator originally misprinted the author's surname) An 1864 book by Robert Chambers, upon which this letter seems to have been based, describes the theories as \\"most lame and unsatisfactory suggestions\\" compared with the Dalrymple theory. The book dismisses the Culloden theory because of an earlier 1745 caricature of \\"the young chevalier attempting to lead a herd of bulls, laden with papal curses, excommunications &c.;, across the Tweed, with the Nine of Diamonds lying before them\\". More recent opinion In the 1898 edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, the \\"Pope Joan\\" and \\"Comette\\" theories are favoured, although many of the others are listed; more recent editions venture no opinion. In Gurney Benham's book about playing cards, in describing the game of Pope Joan he gives his own explanation for why this card is known as the Curse of Scotland: \\"The crown of Scotland contained only nine stones, as they never could afford a tenth\\". quoting Eric Partridge's Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang considers: ‚Äúthe various theories are as interesting as they are unconvincing‚Äù. Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland states that the Curse of Scotland \\"is usually taken to be the nine of diamonds playing card, though explanations [therefor] differ\\". Other connotations =Nine of diamonds= The 19th century Tarot of Marseilles is one of the standard designs for tarot cards. It contains a \\"Pope\\" card (and, indeed, a \\"Popess\\") but there seems to be no connection with the Pope Joan card game, even though the popess may have derived from the mythical Pope Joan. \\"The Nine of Diamonds\\" is the title of a book about close- up magic, produced by a Scottish collective of magicians, which includes references to the myths and tales about the card. =Curse of Scotland= The expression \\"Curse of Scotland\\" is sometimes used simply to refer to an occasion of bad luck at cards and can also refer generally to unwanted situations in Scotland, such as swarms of midges. There is a theatrical superstition, sometimes called the Scottish curse, that speaking the name Macbeth in the theatre brings bad luck. Hence \\"the Scottish Play\\" is used to refer to Shakespeare's play.
