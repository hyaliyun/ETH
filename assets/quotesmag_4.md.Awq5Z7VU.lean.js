The group record songs about Lancashire, technology and British culture (e.g. \\"Chippy Tea\\", \\"He's Turned Emo\\", \\"eBay Eck\\"). The group's songs make use of Lancashire dialect. Their first single, \\"He's Turned Emo\\", gained over 230,000 plays on MySpace (as of 17 March 2008) and was featured on BBC Radio One by Colin Murray. Their debut album, Never Mind The Hotpots, was a minor hit, reaching number one comedy album on iTunes in the UK, and number two in the BBC 6 Music Album Charts. The current members are Bernard Thresher (vocals, guitar, ukulele, drums), Dickie Ticker (bell tree, mandolin, melodica, hand percussion), Bob Wriggles (bass guitar, synth bass), Billy McCartney (keyboards) Kenny Body (drums), and Ron Seal (lead guitar). Billy and Kenny joined following the death of founder member Willie Eckerslike whereas Ron joined in 2016. Eckerslike (born Tom McGrath; drums, vocals) died 11 May 2010, aged 38.  History  Bernard Thresher and Bob Wriggles met while working at Knowsley Safari Park and subsequently formed their first rock band together, Korova. Whilst working at St Helens College, Wriggles met Dickie Ticker who was producing electronic music and light-hearted remixes under the name 'Diffusion'. The three became interested in working together and, after Korova disbanded, Thresher and Wriggles joined forces with Ticker to create electronic dance music under the new guise of Emmet. They first dabbled with comedy music, producing a remix of the Coldplay song \\"Clocks\\" for Radio One DJ Chris Moyles in the style of the German dance group Scooter. In a play on words they named the side project Moped. The track proved popular with listeners of the show and they went on to produce several more remixes as well as playing live in clubs around the country. On the request of Moyles, they produced a remix of songs by Norman Cook aka Fatboy Slim in order to perform them at an outside broadcast in a pub in Brighton. Cook was a guest on the show and Moped performed the remix live on the show for him. Whilst being interviewed on the show he said he 'felt as though his whole life had flashed before him.' Ticker then had the idea of a folk band who write songs and tell stories about modern life: not about orchards and craft fairs but online dating and modern technology. Originally intended to be called The Bolton Weavers (after folk band the Houghton Weavers) the band was in fact named The Lancashire Hotpots. They made their first recordings in Thresher's front room in Coventry after an Emmet gig at a comic convention in Birmingham where they played to an empty room. Billy McCartney was in Liverpool band Lyons and Tigers who supported the Hotpots numerous times around the North West of England. Kenny Body was in several St Helens based bands including Jessica's Ghost, The Ups and Giant Root Attack. Both were enlisted to play in the band following death of original drummer, Willie Eckerslike. Incidentally, Kenny Body briefly appeared as an audience member in their \\"Carry You Home\\" video. Influences include the Oldham Tinkers, George Formby, Hip hop and John Cooper Clarke, as well as the Houghton Weavers.  Festivals  As well as touring nationwide, the band play at major music festivals playing events such as Glastonbury Festival, Kendal Calling, Y Not Festival, Carfest and Beat-Herder Festival.  Television  Television appearances for the group include performing their song ‚ÄòDibnah‚Äô live on BBC2‚Äôs Too Much TV on 28/3/2016.  Olympic controversy  The group were contacted by the International Olympic Committee in August 2016 over their 2008 song \\"The Beer Olympics\\". The IOC claimed trademark rights over the word Olympics stating that Hotpots‚Äô use of the word was a breach of their trademark. To avoid further problems, the band subsequently retitled the song \\"The Beer International Non-Profit, Non-Governmental Sporting Quad Yearly Event\\".

Roman jurists wondered why the ius gentium (the laws which applied to foreigners and citizens alike) was in general accepted by all people living in the Empire. Their conclusion was that these laws made sense to a reasonable person and thus were followed. All laws which would make sense to a normal person were called ius naturale. Slavery, for example, was part of the empire-wide ius gentium because slavery was known and accepted as a normal social institution in all parts of the known world. Nevertheless, as forcing people to work for others was a human-produced condition, it was not considered natural and, hence, was part of the ius gentium but not the ius naturale. The ius naturale of the Roman jurists is not the same as implied by the modern sense of natural law as something derived from pure reason. As Sir Henry James Sumner Maine puts it, \\"it was never thought of as founded on quite untested principles. The notion was that it underlay existing law and must be looked for through it\\".Sir Henry Sumner Maine, Ancient Law, 10th ed., p. 67 Romans gave to Natural law a great importance in their daily lives .

At that time there were 55 aircraft based at this airport: 87% single-engine, 9% multi- engine and 4% jet. Air Resorts Airline Flight 953 accident On December 16, 1984, Air Resorts Airlines Flight 953 experienced an in-flight engine failure, fire, and ground collision during the landing roll following an emergency landing at the airport. The flight was carrying the East Tennessee State University basketball team to Oxford, Mississippi from Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the 39 occupants of the Convair CV 440 airplane were seriously injured during the accident, 11 others received minor injuries. As the airport did not have on-field emergency services, the nearby Jasper Fire Department was called by the airport manager moments before the emergency landing after being alerted by the Birmingham Approach air traffic controller. During the landing the aircraft veered off Runway 27 and crossed the north-south taxiway, at which time the right landing gear separated and the airplane skidded to a stop. The aircraft was subsequently destroyed by fire. The NTSB concluded the accident resulted from the failure of the Number 6 cylinder in the right engine which caused a complete loss of power with a subsequent windmilling propeller and engine fire.

Named after a subterranean lake in Antarctica, it rose out of the collapse of progressive metal band Mayadome in 2001. Biography Loch Vostok was formed in 2001 by drummer Teddy M√∂ller out of the ashes of his previous progressive metal band Mayadome. Bringing with him keyboardist Sebastian Okupski and bassplayer Erik Grandin along with new recruits guitarist Niklas Kupper and drummer Alvaro Svaner√∂, M√∂ller switched role from drums to singer and guitarist for the new band. However Grandin was to relocate to the United States and was replaced by Tomas \\"Tym\\" Jonsson which M√∂ller had played with previously in Mellow Poetry. With the line-up complete Loch Vostok set out to record a self-financed album with producer Daniel Bergstrand in 2002. The result was Dark Logic. An album which the lyrics were entirely based upon infamous serial killers such as Henry Lee Lucas, Andrei Chikatilo and Ed Gein. The Russian distributor CD- maximum were the first to pick up the album and shortly after Magnetism records released it officially worldwide in August 2004. After the album's release keyboardist Sebastian Okupski decided to leave Loch Vostok to focus on other projects. The vacancy was filled by Andreas Lindahl of Platitude but due to the distance between Uppsala and Gothenburg he decided to leave the band after the recordings of the new album Destruction Time Again!. In December 2005 keyboardist/composer Fredrik Klingwall of Flagellation, Anima Morte, etc. joined Loch Vostok. And with Destruction Time Again! out on their new label, Escapi Music, they hit the road supporting King Diamond in the Scandinavian leg of his European 2006 tour. With the album being quite well received Loch Vostok set out to do more gigs to support the album following the King Diamond tour in 2006 and 2007 with among others Pyramaze, Grave and Rotting Christ, as well as playing the 5-year anniversary of Headway Festival (A festival which they had also played in 2003) in Amsterdam. In 2007 they also began the recordings of the follow-up to 2006 years Destruction Time Again! in Teddy's own Blueflame Studio, an album that came to be Reveal No Secrets, which then was released in the summer of 2009. After this release, the band entered a kind of hibernation era, with M√∂ller being very busy with his other band, F.K.√ú.. Current drummer Svaner√∂ decided to leave, and was replaced by Lawrence Dinamarca. In 2011, the band signed a three-album deal with Vicisolum Productions and released critically acclaimed Dystopium, which was then shortly followed by a tour with Therion and Leprous. Tomas \\"Tym\\" Jonsson decided to leave the band before the tour, due to complications with a herniated spine, and was replaced on bass by Jimmy Mattsson of Planet Rain.

Most sports are organised on an all-Ireland basis, for example rugby union, gaelic games, basketball, rugby league, hockey and cricket, whereas others, like association football and netball are organised on a separate basis for Northern Ireland.How do other sports in the island cope with the situation? The Herald, 3 April 2008 Boxing Boxing is a popular sport in Northern Ireland. Prominent Northern Irish boxers include Carl Frampton, Wayne McCullough and Ray Close, amongst others . Golf Golf is a very popular sport in Northern Ireland. Golfers from Northern Ireland have enjoyed great success in recent years. Between 2010 and 2015 Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy won 25% of the titles in Major Championships. Association football The Irish Football Association (IFA) is the organising body for football (soccer) in Northern Ireland, and was historically the governing body for the whole of the island. The IFA sits on the International Football Association Board, which is responsible for the laws of the game. The Northern Ireland Women's Football Association (NIWFA) is the IFA's women's football arm. It runs a Women's Cup, Women's League and the Northern Ireland women's national football team. Many football fans in Northern Ireland prefer to support teams from England such as Manchester United and Liverpool and teams from Scotland such as Celtic and Rangers. =Domestic competitions= The domestic league is the IFA Premiership. Some of the major teams include Linfield F.C., and Glentoran F.C.. Derry City FC is based in Northern Ireland but plays in the Republic of Ireland's league. The Milk Cup is a successful international youth tournament held annually in Northern Ireland, in which clubs and national teams from anywhere in the world may compete. Northern Ireland also played host to the 2005 UEFA Under-19 European Championships. The Setanta Sports Cup was set up by its sponsors, television channel Setanta Ireland. It is an all-island tournament, featuring twelve teams, six from the League of Ireland and six from the Irish League. Despite fairly low turn-outs for each jurisdiction's leagues, the Setanta Cup drew relatively successful gate receipts and in five editions has had one winner from Northern Ireland (Linfield in 2005). =National team= Northern Ireland's international team, despite a poor run of form in the late 1990s and first few years of the 21st century, and a corresponding slump in the FIFA World Rankings, enjoyed great success in the early and mid-1980s and recently had a revival in their fortunes under manager former Lawrie Sanchez, with home wins over Spain and England. Most of the players come from the English or Scottish leagues although occasional appearances of Irish League players have been known.  Gaelic games  Gaelic games include Gaelic football, hurling, and Gaelic handball. = Governing body = Gaelic games in Northern Ireland are controlled by the Ulster Provincial Board, which covers all nine counties of Ulster. =Competitions= Every footballer or hurler plays for a local club, with the best players being selected for county panels. Each county has its own county championship, with the winners going on to play in the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship or Ulster Senior Club Hurling Championship. Crossmaglen Rangers are currently the most successful football club in Northern Ireland. The county teams play in pre-season competitions, such as the National Football League, which serves as preparation for the Ulster Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. The hurling equivalents are the National Hurling League, Ulster Senior Hurling Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. In recent years, the most successful football teams from Northern Ireland have been Tyrone GAA and Armagh GAA. Hurling teams from Northern Ireland have found it difficult to make an impact against the top counties from the Republic, with Antrim GAA the most successful. County players may be selected for the Ulster provincial side to play in the Railway Cup. The team has won the Interprovincial Football Championship 32 times, but has never won the Interprovincial Hurling Championship. At international level, footballers can play for the Ireland International Rules football team against the best Australian Rules football players from Australia. Hurlers playing in the lower divisions of the All- Ireland Championship are eligible to play against the best shinty players from Scotland in composite rules shinty-hurling. Rugby union Rugby union is a popular team sport played in Ireland. The sport is organised on an all-Ireland basis with one team, governing body and league for both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Governing body Irish Rugby Football Union The Irish Rugby Football Union is the governing body for rugby union in Ireland. The IRFU is divided into four branches which represent the four provinces of Ireland: Ulster, Munster, Leinster and Connacht. = Competitions = See also Irish rugby union system Irish provinces compete in the Pro14, against Welsh regions and Scotland super-districts. The four Irish provinces also compete in the Heineken Cup. Competitions have taken place since the late 19th century with the modern day Inter-provincial Championship between Munster, Leinster, Ulster and Connacht first contested in 1920. Another focus for the domestic game in Ireland is the All-Ireland League. This was started in 1990 and has now expanded to three divisions. = Statistics = According to the IRB, Ireland has 201 rugby union clubs; 614 referees; 25,000 pre-teen male players; 35,000 teen male players; 14,500 senior male players (total male players 74,500) as well as 10,000 pre-teen female players; 800 teen female players; 1,200 senior female players (total female players 12,000). The IRFU Annual Report for season 2006‚Äì2007 reported playing figures within Ireland as follows: *Adult Male Players: 21740 *Women Players: 1756 *Number of Secondary Schools Players: 23586 *Number of Youth Players: 12472 *Number of Mini Rugby Players: 10967 *Primary School: 32209 *TOTAL PLAYERS: 100974 = Current trends = The professional era and the advent of the Celtic League and Heineken Cup has seen rugby union become a major spectator sport in Ireland. European Cup games are generally well supported in all the provinces with sell outs the norm and massive crowds in Dublin's Lansdowne Road for the Quarter and Semis which Ulster have won and Munster and Leinster have reached. Ulster have led the Celtic League attendances for 3 years in the row and Connacht, Munster and Leinster's crowds have grown year on year. All the provinces are planning major ground upgrades to increase capacity and comfort. Ireland international games sell out against all but the weakest opposition, and with the team playing at Croke Park this year the attendances may reach 80,000. = The All-Ireland national team = The Ireland national team are considered by the IRB to be in the first tier. Ireland contest the Millennium Trophy with England as part of the Six Nations Championship. Every four years the British and Irish Lions go on tour with players from Ireland as well as England, Scotland and Wales.  Motorsport  Northern Ireland is well known as being a centre for motorcycle road racing: two international races are held in the province, the North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix. Road racer Joey Dunlop was voted as Northern Ireland's greatest ever sportsperson in a Belfast Telegraph poll, ahead of footballer George Best. During his career he took five consecutive Formula I World Championships, 26 Isle of Man TTs, 13 wins at the North West 200 and 24 victories at the Ulster GP, and attracted support from both the Protestant and Catholic communities. In addition, his brother Robert and nephews Michael and William have also been successful road racers, with all three taking multiple wins at the North West 200 and Ulster GP and Robert and Michael also taking several TT victories. Other notable road racers from the province include Phillip McCallen, who took 11 TT wins, including four in one week in 1996, five wins out of six races at the 1992 North West 200, five wins on one day at the 1996 Ulster GP, as well as the Macau Grand Prix, and Ryan Farquhar, another multiple winner at the TT, North West 200 and Ulster GP, who took a total of 384 wins during his career. On the track, Jonathan Rea broke records in the World Superbike Championship in 2018, when he became the first rider to win four consecutive Superbike world titles. He also holds the records for most wins and most podiums in the championship. One of Rea's main rivals in Superbikes has been fellow Ulsterman Eugene Laverty. In Grand Prix racing, Belfast native Ralph Bryans was 50cc World Champion in 1965, becoming the only Irish rider to win a Grand Prix world title: he also took ten Grand Prix wins across his career. On four wheels, Northern Ireland's most notable Formula One drivers are John Watson, who took five Grand Prix wins in the 1970s and 1980s and finished third in the 1982 Formula One season, and Eddie Irvine, who took four wins for Ferrari on the way to second place in the 1999 Formula One season. In touring car racing, Colin Turkington is a three time British Touring Car Champion, having won titles in 2009, 2014 and 2018, and has also been a race winner in the World Touring Car Championship. In rallying, the province's most notable names are Paddy Hopkirk, who won some of the most prestigious events in international rallying in the 1960s in his Mini Cooper S, including the Monte Carlo Rally, the Alpine Rally and the Acropolis Rally, and Kris Meeke, who has taken multiple rally wins in the World Rally Championship.

It has been played here since the early 19th century, against Scotland (a match which has first-class status) has been played annually since 1909. The Irish team was fairly strong in the mid and late 19th century, and sent several touring parties abroad, but development of the sport was adversely affected first by the Gaelic Athletic Association's ban on its members taking part in \\"foreign\\" sports and then by the creation of the Irish Free State; many of the best cricketers in Ireland had been British soldiers and civil servants and their withdrawal led to a decline in the overall standard of the game. There have been brighter spots in recent years, however. Dublin-born batsman Ed Joyce has played with some success as part of Ireland's ICC Trophy team and is now a key member of the Middlesex side in England's County Championship; he captained the county in 2004. Interest in Irish cricket was also generated by the national team's startling victory over West Indies in 1969; they did it again on 17 June 2004. The sport is organised on an all-island basis and is overseen by the Cricket Ireland, founded in its present incarnation in 1923. Ireland has entered some domestic English tournaments since the early 1980s, but becoming an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council in 1993 paved the way for participation in international competition, and indeed the 2005 ICC Trophy was hosted by Ireland. The Irish finished second in the tournament, beaten by Scotland. Ireland has co-hosted the Cricket World Cup in 1999. Dublin also hosted one game of the 1999 World Cup. The 2007 World Cup which was held in the West Indies was a very successful tournament for the Irish Cricket team. Having qualified for the first time for the tournament, Ireland entered the arena with much to gain. Ireland tied the match with Test Cricket playing team Zimbabwe and shocked Pakistan by defeating them on St. Patrick's Day. Suddenly there was much talk about Cricket in Ireland. Ireland qualified for the super 8 and recorded some good results, including a win against Bangladesh. Ireland have been granted ODI status and now they appear in the ODI ranking table.

Public law regulated the relationships of the government to its citizens, including taxation, while ius privatum (private law), based upon property and contract, concerned relations between individuals.Nicholas, Barry (1962). An Introduction to Roman Law. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 2: \\"The Romans themselves made a distinction between public law and private law. The former was concerned with the functioning of the state, and included in particular constitutional law and criminal law; the latter was concerned with relations between individuals.\\" The public/private law dichotomy is a structural core of Roman law and all modern western legal systems. Public law will only include some areas of private law close to the end of the Roman state. Ius publicum was used also to describe obligatory legal regulations, such as ius cogens, which is now a term used in public international law meaning basic rules which cannot (or should not) be broken, or contracted out of. Regulations that can be changed are called today ius dispositivum, and they are used when party shares something and are not in opposition.

Contrasted with ius publicum (the laws relating to the state), ius privatum regulated the relations between individuals. In Roman law this included personal, property and civil law. Judicial proceeding was a private process (iudicium privatum). Criminal law was also considered private matters, except where the crimes were particularly severe. Lex Aquilia The lex Aquilia was a plebiscite which codified the law on damage to person and property through a particular fault. It is a forerunner of the modern law of tort. Stipulatio Stipulatio was the basic form of contract in Roman law. It was made in the format of question and answer. The precise nature of the contract was disputed, as can be seen below. Vindicatio Rei vindicatio is a legal action by which the plaintiff demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff. It may only be used when plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant is somehow impeding the plaintiff's possession of the thing. The plaintiff could also institute an actio furti (a personal action) in order to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant with the aid of the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), the plaintiff could claim damages from the defendant.

The closest m√©tro station is Saint-Augustin 15px 15px History The elevation of the main facade by Victor Baltard The view from the Arc de Triomphe =Haussmann's Plan= During the reign of Napoleon III in the 1850s and 60s Paris experienced a dramatic transformation under the direction of Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann. Haussmann cut many boulevards through the crowded, medieval city placing prominent public buildings at the boulevard ends to provide impressive vistas. The boulevard Malesherbes was laid out cutting northwest from La Madeleine. Saint-Augustin, close to the spot where Haussmann was born, was built to provide a counterpoint to the famous columns of La Madeleine at the other end of the boulevard. It was also designed to be visible from the Arc de Triomphe down the avenue de Friedland. The chosen site, an odd shaped lot at the intersection of four streets, and the need for a dome of so as to be visible from the Arc de Triomphe, dictated unusual proportions for the building. The church was designed by Haussmann's fellow Protestant, architect Victor Baltard who also famously designed Les Halles markets. While Baltard's use of iron in Saint-Augustin's structure is praised for its inventiveness, at least one critic has described the church as, \\"an eyesore: ridiculously sited, without proportion, crushed beneath an outsized dome.\\" The neighborhood around the church is now one of the most expensive in Paris. =Architecture= Saint-Augustin was built between 1860 and 1868 in an eclectic style combining Tuscan Gothic and Romanesque elements. The structure is in length and in width, and was one of the first sizable buildings in Paris constructed around a metal frame. Saint-Augustin's facade features a frieze by Fran√ßois Jouffroy depicting Jesus and the twelve apostles above the four evangelists. Internally, the stained glass windows depict bishops and martyrs of the first centuries and the cast-iron columns are decorated with polychrome angels. A statue of Joan of Arc, by Paul Dubois, was erected in the church in 1896. The church features paintings by William- Adolphe Bouguereau, Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, √âmile Signol, Alexandre-Dominique Denuelle and sculpture by Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse and Henri Chapu. It was intended to be the resting place of Napoleon III and the Empress Eug√©nie who died in exile and were instead interred in St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough in England. =Organ= The organ is celebrated in the world of organ building. The church's main organ was built by Charles Spackman Barker. One of the earliest organs to employ electricity, it features 54 stops with three 54-key manual keyboards and pedalboards.

The society founded in 1880 publishes a wide range of monographies, guides and inventories. These include the series Art monuments of Switzerland (, ), which includes more than hundred volumes, the first of which was published in 1927. It also publishes the quarterly journal Kunst und Architektur in der Schweiz.  The origins of the ¬´Gesellschaft f√ºr schweizerische Kunstgeschichte¬ª (Society for the history of art in Switzerland)  = Precursor of the Swiss National Museum and the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments = The ¬´Gesellschaft f√ºr schweizerische Kunstgeschichte GSK¬ª (Society for the history of art in Switzerland SHAS), named thus since 1934, was founded in June 1880 in Zofingen under the name of the ¬´Vaterl√§ndische Gesellschaft f√ºr Erhaltung historischer Denkm√§ler¬ª (Patriotic Society for the preservation of historic monuments). Its creation was due to important personalities, members of the Schweizerischer Kunstverein (Swiss society of fine arts), and its first president was the Genevan painter, Theodore de Saussure, grandson of the celebrated naturalist Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure. The vice-presidency was held by the Zurich art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The ¬´Patriotic society for the preservation of historic monuments¬ª had as its aim to preserve and restore architectural monuments, but also to save scattered works of art by bringing them together in museums, to arouse a better understanding for the ¬´fine arts¬ª and to support artists, painters and sculptors. In the statutes adopted at the meeting of this committee on 20 June 1880, the name of the society was altered to ¬´Verein f√ºr Erhaltung vaterl√§ndischer Kunstdenkm√§ler¬ª (Association for the preservation of artistic monuments of the fatherland). The regulations stipulated that the sums received must be divided and entered in the accounts in two equal shares to be used, on the one hand, to finance publications and, on the other hand, to buy works of art and old objects of value. This second part of the fund was also allocated for the restoration of historic monuments that were at risk of being destroyed or falling into ruin. The association changed its name once more at the general meeting in Lausanne in 1881 to become the ¬´Schweizerische Gesellschaft f√ºr Erhaltung historischer Kunstdenkm√§ler¬ª (Swiss society for the preservation of historic art monuments). It then dealt mainly with buying items and buildings of national importance, without neglecting its publications. A brief treatise on the reliquary cross of Engelberg (end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century) appeared in 1881 from the pen of the art historian Johann Rudolf Rahn. The same author wrote a description of the stained glass window dating from 1530 in the Reformed Church of St Saphorin (Vaud), then an article on the Casa Borrani (or Serodine) in Ascona with its baroque fa√ßade. At the general meeting in 1882, a request was made to set up an inventory of buildings requiring preservation or restoration works and of objets d'art which were at risk of being destroyed or sold. In March 1884, the Federal Department of the Interior responded to a motion on the subject of the creation of a Swiss National Museum and entrusted the ¬´Society for the preservation of historical art monuments¬ª with the acquisition of a certain number of objects of its choice, but the ownership of which would revert to the Confederation. In the implementing ordinance of 25 February 1887, a Federal Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities of Switzerland was created and its competences and duties were passed to the committee of the ¬´Society for the preservation of historical art monuments¬ª. In the same year, the statutes of the latter were adapted to its new function. = Creation of the Swiss National Museum = In 1891, the Federal Council (Swiss Government) founded the Swiss National Museum with its head office in Zurich and the purchase of antiquities then no longer came within the competence of the ¬´Society for the preservation of historical art monuments¬ª. This decision was confirmed on 12 March 1892. The Society continued its inventory, preservation and restoration work on historic works of art, and excavations. In 1896, Karl Stehlin, then President of the Society (1895‚Äì1898) who had succeeded Julius Kunkler (1888‚Äì1895), was called on to take charge of a new subsidiary research commission relating to the Roman period. Josef Zemp (1898‚Äì1904 and 1915‚Äì1916) and Albert Naef, who took over the presidency from Zemp between 1904 and 1915, pleaded for equality of treatment of the different old styles, rejecting any organisation of the periods into a hierarchy. They attached great importance to as complete a job of preservation as possible of the authentic work and a distinction between what was original and what was reconstructed, in order to avoid any pastiche. Starting from 1899, the ¬´Anzeiger f√ºr schweizerische Altertumskunde¬ª (Directory of Swiss Antiquities), published by the Swiss National Museum, served as the official organ of the ¬´Society for the preservation of historical art monuments¬ª, complemented from 1901 on by the publication of the Communications in two editions, German and French. The first issue of this series was devoted to the stained-glass windows of the chancel of the church in Oberkirch near Frauenfeld and the Weinmarkt (wine market) fountain in Lucerne, with texts by Johann Rudolf Rahn and Josef Zemp. The state archivist Robert Durrer edited the statistics of the monuments of Obwalden and Nidwalden, published in a supplement to the ¬´Anzeiger f√ºr schweizerische Altertumskunde¬ª and reprinted in 1971. At the same time, in 1900 Paul Ganz suggested the establishment of a directory with photographs of old stained-glass windows in Switzerland, as well as working drawings and designs of stained-glass windows. Appointed director of the Art Museum in Basle, he succeeded in building up a small collection by 1902 which became the starting point of the ¬´Archiv f√ºr schweizerische Kunstgeschichte¬ª (Archives of the history of art in Switzerland). At the same time, Johann Rudolf Rahn began to draw up an inventory of Switzerland's art and history monuments. = Creation of the ¬´Eidgen√∂ssische Kommission f√ºr Denkmalpflege¬ª (Federal Commission of Historic Monuments) = In 1915, the Department of the Interior created a Federal Commission of Historic Monuments and the Society's activity in the field of the preservation of monuments thus had to come to an end. Funds of 2000 francs ‚Äì later 3000 ‚Äì for ¬´small restoration works¬ª were, however, granted to the Society as consolation. These funds were paid until 1960. Having thus been successively relieved of two essential tasks, that is the acquisition or works of art and the preservation of monuments, the Society devoted itself from then on more intensely to the publication of works. = The ¬´Inventar der Kunstdenkm√§ler der Schweiz¬ª (Inventory of Monuments of art and history of Switzerland) = In 1920, under the presidency of the Genevan architect Camille Martin (1916‚Äì1922), the scholarly inventory of Switzerland's art and history monuments was able to commence: Samuel Guyer undertook the architectural inventory of the canton of Zurich, Linus Birchler that of the cantons of Schwyz and Uri. The Society's committee submitted a request for grants to the federal authorities and drew up rules in 1924 to determine the organisation of these far-reaching works. In 1925, in agreement with the Department of the Interior and various scholarly associations, the Society undertook the publication of the national inventory of the Monuments of art and history of Switzerland in close collaboration with the cantons. The first volume, devoted to three districts of the canton of Schwyz, that is Einsiedeln, March and H√∂fe, appeared in 1927. It was the work of the architectural historian Linus Birchler, the first president of the Federal Commission of Historic Monuments. Since then, more than 120 volumes of this collection have been published. They were complemented between 1982 and 2004 by the ¬´Inventar der neueren Schweizer Architektur, 1850-1920 INSA¬ª (Swiss inventory of architecture), a collection of eleven volumes. The ¬´Society for the history of art in Switzerland¬ª also publishes the ¬´Schweizerischer Kunstf√ºhrer¬ª (Guides to Swiss monuments), a series launched in 1935 by Paul Ganz, of regional or cantonal guides, special issues touching on specific subjects linked to the history of art and architecture, as well as its quarterly revue ¬´Kunst+Architektur in der Schweiz¬ª (Art+Architecture in Switzerland).

It is regarded as the classic reference work on Bordeaux wines, and is to date considered the most comprehensive information source on Bordeaux' wineries.winepros.com.au. amazon.com Bordeaux and Its Wines 15th edition, Hugh Johnson preface History Jean-Baptiste F√©ret founded the publishing house La Librairie F√©ret in Bordeaux in 1812, which became F√©ret et fils in 1841. In 1846 Michel- √âdouard F√©ret approached Charles Cocks, an English schoolmaster and wine enthusiast living in Bordeaux since 1840, to publish a directory of wine aimed at his compatriots. At 84 pages containing historical observations and assessment of Bordeaux wine, Bordeaux, its Wines and the Claret Country was published in London that year. It was not the first publication dealing solely with Bordeaux wines however, in many ways its forerunner is cited as Traite sur les vins du Medoc (1824) by William Franck. A French translation was proposed by F√©ret, which led to Guide de l'√©tranger √† Bordeaux et dans la Gironde. Bordeaux, ses environs et ses vins class√©s par ordre de m√©rite published in 1850, with further emphasis on classifying wines in order of merit. This directory would be considered the first edition of Bordeaux et ses Vins. Charles Cocks died in 1854, while the second edition, Bordeaux et ses Vins 2√®me √©dition, appeared in 1868, and the succession of publications provide a useful historical record of the evolution of different properties' and districts' reputations. Revisions are published to date, usually referred to as \\"Le F√©ret\\", most recently with the 2007 edition of Bordeaux et ses Vins 18√®me √©dition. The English language translations are titled Bordeaux and Its Wines, with the seventeenth edition published in 2004. Early classification Nearly a decade before the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, Cocks assessed Ch√¢teau Lafite, Ch√¢teau Latour, Ch√¢teau Margaux and Ch√¢teau Haut-Brion as First Growths, while ranking as Second Growths Ch√¢teau Mouton, Ch√¢teau L√©oville (present day Ch√¢teau L√©oville-Las Cases, Ch√¢teau L√©oville-Poyferr√© and Ch√¢teau L√©oville Barton) Ch√¢teau Rauzan (present day Ch√¢teau Rauzan-S√©gla and Ch√¢teau Rauzan-Gassies), Ch√¢teau Durfort, Ch√¢teau Gruaud-Larose, Ch√¢teau Lascombes and Ch√¢teau Gorse (present day Ch√¢teau Brane-Cantenac).

The party was launched on 7 October 2007. History Bimal Gurung, a former GNLF councillor of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, fell out with Subhash Ghisingh for \\"opposing the Sixth Schedule status for the hills and for his speeches against Subhash Ghisingh, the party president\\". Gurung, who was considered one of the most powerful leaders of the hills, stated to oppose the Sixth Schedule bill even though it had received Cabinet approval in the Indian Parliament. He founded GJM on 7 October 2007. The aims and the objectives of the new party was to \\"fight for the democratic right of the Indian Gorkhas living in India and (to) work unitedly for the creation of separate state for the people residing in the three Hill Sub-Division of Darjeeling, Siliguri Terai and Dooars areas. Opposition of the Sixth Schedule GJM‚Äôs opposition of the sixth schedule and demand for Gorkhaland was supported by Dr Mahendra P. Lama, Dr Vimal Khawas, and other parties as well, viz. the BJP, the Congress, the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM), and the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL). The BJP organised an all-party meet attended by the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the GJM, the ABGL, the CPRM, the Gorkha Rashtriya Congress, and the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh (BGP), which adopted a resolution asking the state to drop the Sixth Schedule proposal and remove Ghisingh as caretaker administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). The Hill parties did not want the Sixth Schedule as Clause 11 of the Sixth Schedule stated \\"this in principle Memorandum of Settlement is the full and final settlement of the Darjeeling Hill Areas issue and no further demands in this regard would be entertained\\". GJM burnt copies of the 1988 Memorandum of Settlement which had categorically stated, \\"the GNLF agreed to drop the demand for a separate State of Gorkhaland\\", thereby reviving the century-old demand of Gorkhaland. The GNLF tried stalling the GJM through various means, and an FIR was also lodged against the party president Bimal Gurung for the attack on a former DGHC councilor K.B. Gurung, but anticipatory bail was granted to Bimal Gurung. GJM observed hunger strikes, indefinite strikes and prevented locally produced goods from reaching the rest of Bengal, as a protest against the imposition of the Sixth Schedule and for the removal of Subhash Ghisingh. A team was also deputed to New Delhi to apprise the national leaders about the general consensus of the people of the DGHC area because of which, L.K. Advani refused to support Buddhadeb Bhattacharya's bid to push Darjeeling into Sixth Schedule. The Bharatiya Janata Party's refusal of the sixth schedule status for DGHC pushed it to the Parliamentary Committee. The Parliamentary Committee in its findings suggested that \\"the Ministry of Home Affairs is required to make a fresh assessment of the ground realities all over again before proceeding with the Bills in the two Houses of Parliament\\". The Sixth Schedule bill was thus put in the back burner. The only supporter of the Sixth Schedule, Subhash Ghisingh, was banned from entering the hills. Ghisingh was finally forced to resign on 10 March 2008 as DGHC caretaker. Demand for Gorkhaland Proposed Gorkhaland map \\"The name \\"Gorkhaland\\" is claimed to have been coined by Subhash Ghisingh on 5 April 1980, cf., his speech of 7 September 1989 at Darjeeling\\". After a violent agitation in the 1980s, which claimed more than 1200 lives in the hills, Subhash Ghisingh settled for the DGHC. After a lull of Ghisingh's 20 years rule, the demand for Gorkhaland was again revived by GJM under the leadership of Bimal Gurung. The total area of the proposed state is 6246 km2 and comprises Banarhat, Bhaktinagar, Birpara, Chalsa, Darjeeling, Jaigaon, Kalchini, Kalimpong, Kumargram, Kurseong, Madarihat, Malbazar, Mirik and Nagarkatta. Unlike the 1980s, GJM has maintained that the struggle for Gorkhaland would be through non-violence and non-cooperation. GJM initially resorted to bandhs, hunger strikes and non- payment of utility bills to further their demand. It was quite enough to get the attention of the State Government, who invited them to Kolkata for bipartite talks. GJM refused to attends the talks as the state Government had set preconditions that they would discuss developmental issues but not Gorkhaland. The Chief Minister extended the invitation again and denied having set any preconditions for the talks. The first tripartite talks between Government of India, Government of West Bengal and leaders of the Hill Parties headed by GJM was held on 8 September 2008. The hill delegation also submitted a 51-page memorandum to the Union Home Secretary, Government of India. > \\"The demand for a separate state within the Constitutional framework and > within the Indian Union, consisting of Darjeeling District and the Dooars > region of West Bengal is arguably the oldest and most outstanding demand in > the country today. This demand for separate statehood is founded on the > bedrock of a historical, economic and political rationale. Against the > backdrop of socio-economic exploitation, political and cultural hegemony, > misgovernance and exclusion, the demand has become an expression of the > ingrained and deep rooted aspirations of the people to secure to themselves, > and to their succeeding generations, the right to determine their own > future.\\" After three and a half years of agitation for a state of Gorkhaland, the GJM reached an agreement with the state government to form a semi-autonomous body that will replace the DGHC to administer the Darjeeling hills. A bill for the creation of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) will be introduced in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly soon. The GTA will have administrative, executive and financial powers but no legislative powers. The Memorandum of Agreement for GTA was signed on 18 July 2011 at Pintail Village near Siliguri in the presence of Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leaders. The agreement was signed by West Bengal Home Secretary G.D. Gautama, Union Home Ministry Joint Secretary K.K. Pathak and GJM general secretary Roshan Giri. On 29 October 2011, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad (ABAVP), Dooars Unit signed an 18-point agreement at Mongpong, after which these organisations jointly proposed a new administrative body called the Gorkhaland and Adivasi Territorial Administration (GATA) in place of the GTA. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha announced that it would contest the GTA polls, which it had earlier threatened to boycott over the Justice Sen-headed committee recommendations on territorial inclusion of the Dooars and Terai that it had rejected. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha announced the names of its GTA election nominees. Following Trinamool Congress' decision not to contest the GTA election, GJM won all 45 seats. From the beginning of 2013, tensions started to surface between the TMC and the GJM. Following the announcement of the creation of the new state of Telangana, the hills erupted into a new phase of agitation. This was characterised by strikes, 'Janata Curfews' (in which townspeople stayed inside their houses), mass protests and the deployment of the CRPF into the hils. During the agitation, Banerjee favoured the Lepcha community with a new Development Board and encouraged other backward communities within the hills to seek further favours from the TMC. This had the effect of breaking down the Hills' united front and GJM's popularity. The TMC also gained electoral support in the hills during this period, as many sought to seek the favours of the new government. The GNLF also started to return to the hills in this period. Many GJM leaders were arrested and detained for extended periods for charges from several years before. Controversies On 21 May 2010, Madan Tamang, the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League leader and a vocal opponent of GJM, was attacked near the Planters Club, Darjeeling by suspected GJM. Three people attacked Tamang directly and one of them hacked him with a sharp weapon. He was rushed to the Darjeeling District Hospital where he soon died. A few days later on 25 May, hundreds of mourners joined his funeral procession in Darjeeling. After the murder, the West Bengal government threatened action against Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, whose senior leaders were named in the police FIR, meanwhile hinting discontinuation of ongoing talks over interim arrangement with the Gorkha party, saying it had \\"lost popular support following the assassination\\". On 8 February 2011, three GJM activists were shot dead at Shibshu (one of whom succumbed to her injuries later) by the police as they tried to enter Jalpaiguri district on a padyatra led by Bimal Gurung from Gorubathan to Jaigaon. This led to violence in the Darjeeling hills and an indefinite strike was called by GJM that lasted 9 days. Elections Jaswant Singh, the BJP candidate, supported by the GJM, won the Darjeeling constituency in the Indian general elections 2009 defeating his nearest rival Jibesh Sarkar of the CPI(M) by a margin of over 2.5 lakh votes. The GJM had supported the BJP in lieu of the latter's positive outlook towards the formation of Gorkhaland as mentioned in their party manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections. GJM candidates won three Darjeeling hill seats in the 2011 West Bengal state assembly election held on 18 April 2011. Trilok Dewan won from Darjeeling constituency, Harka Bahadur Chhetri from Kalimpong constituency, and Rohit Sharma from Kurseong constituency. Wilson Champramari, an independent candidate supported by GJM, also won from Kalchini constituency in the Dooars. TMC hoped to gain the support of GJM for their candidate, Baichung Bhutia for Darjeeling (Lok Sabha constituency) in the Indian general elections in 2014. This was unsuccessful as the party supported the BJP candidate S.S. Ahluwalia. Ahluwalia has claimed that the state government, led by TMC has resorted to scare tactics and electoral fraud to win the election in Darjeeling. Ahluwalia defeated Bhutia by nearly 2 lakh votes. On 18 September 2015, one of GJM's MLAs resigned in protest over the state government's cooperation with the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration. Three days later, the other two quit the assembly.

Looking south and upriver over the eastern basin. The Iffezheim Lock () is a river lock on the Rhine near Iffezheim in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The two passages of the lock serve to allow ships and barges to bypass the hydropower station on the French side of the river. It is one of the heaviest-used locks in Germany, with a daily average of 107 commercial vessels passing through in 2003 and 30 million shipping tonnes per year. The chambers of the double lock have usable areas of 24 x 270 m. The lock is open for passage 24/7/365 and shuttles ships up or down with a water exchange rate of 165 m¬≥/s per chamber, achieving a rise or fall of 1.5 m per minute. The lock retains at least 3.5 m water depth during normal low-water conditions.Annual Report 2003 (from the Leibniz-institute for Waterbody Ecology and Freshwater Fisheries (IGB) website, 2003, Page 85. Accessed 2008-03-02.)Schleuse Iffezheim (from the Water- and Shipping Agency Freiburg website, in German. Accessed 2008-03-02.)  History  In 1840 the Grand Duchy of Baden and France concluded an agreement on Rhine regulation after Johann Gottfried Tulla. In 1902, the Alsatian engineer Koechlin made a push to use the water power of the Rhine. In 1928 the expansion of the Rhine began with the Grand Canal d'Alsace and the first four power stations (Kembs to Vogelgr√ºn), four further barrages in the so-called loop solution (Marckolsheim to Strasbourg) followed in 1959. In 1969 a German-French treaty was concluded for the construction of the Gambsheim and Iffezheim barrages. The construction of the barrage Iffezheim started in 1974. In 1977 the power station, lock and weir were put into operation. A contract to build the fish passes at Iffezheim and Gambsheim was signed in 1997. The fish pass in Iffezheim was put into operation in 2000, the one in Gambsheim in 2006. In 2009 the construction of the 5th turbine in Iffezheim started. At the end of 2011, the water law permit for the installation of a 5th turbine in the Rhine power plant Gambsheim was granted. This will increase the power plant capacity to 1420 m¬≥/s. The additional turbine was pun into operation by 18 October 2013. f>  Weir  The weir of the barrage in Iffezheim is situated on the French side of the Rhine, so that the whole barrage is approximately mirror-inverted to the next higher situated barrage Gambsheim. It consists of six weir fields, each 20 m wide. One weir field consists of a hydraulically operated flap and a chain-driven pressure segment. The weir ensures the flow of the Rhine in the event of water flows that are greater than the capacity of the power plant. The entire plant is designed for a maximum water flow of 7500 m¬≥/s.  sluices  The double sluice consists of two sluice chambers, each 270 metres long and 24 metres wide. The difference in height between headwater and tailwater is about 12.5 metres at low water. They are one of the largest inland locks in Europe. The locks were put into operation on 14 March 1977. They are in operation 24 hours a day in three shifts and are maintained and serviced by the waterways and shipping office Freiburg. Every year, between 25,700 (2008) and 40,600 (1990) ships with approx. 24.4 (2009) to 30.9 (2000) million tonnes of goods pass through the locks in freight and cargo traffic.}}  Fish pass  In 1987 the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR) has drawn up a programme of measures aimed, inter alia, at the reintroduction of salmon into the Rhine. One of the projects to this end was the construction of the fish passes at Iffezheim and Gambsheim, which was approved in the contract of 4 March 1997. The canal, which is modelled on a torrent, consists of 37 individual basins in a row with a water depth of 1.5 m and a total length of 300 m. The Iffezheim fish pass was inaugurated in 2000, Gambsheim was opened in 2006. The construction of the fish pass in Iffezheim was financed by the two states France and Germany and the RKI GmbH. In connection with the fish pass, machine 6 was put into operation as a so-called lock current turbine. This is a Kaplan machine with 1.05 MW asynchronous generator. The fish pass in Gambsheim, which was built subsequently, underwent a number of design changes based on the experience gained in Iffezheim.

He supported the Parliamentarian cause in the English Civil War and was a member of the Council of State during the Commonwealth. Early life Trevor, whose father Sir John Trevor was Surveyor of the Queen's Ships under Elizabeth I, was knighted in 1619. In 1621 he was elected Member of Parliament for Denbighshire. He was elected MP for Flintshire in the Parliaments of 1624 and 1625. In 1628 he was elected MP for Great Bedwyn and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. During the Personal Rule of Charles I, he was a member of several Royal Commissions, and amassed a substantial income: he had inherited from his father a share in the duties levied on coal from Newcastle, said to bring in ¬£1,500 a year, and held the keepership of several Royal forests, all lucrative sinecures. (At one period he was Surveyor of Windsor Great Park.) He inherited Trevalyn Hall on the death of his uncle Richard Trevor in 1638. Civil war and Commonwealth In November 1640 Trevor was elected MP for Grampound in the Long Parliament, having connections with Cornwall through his mother, a Trevanion. He took the parliamentary side during the Civil War, and he was sufficiently supportive of the trial of the King to survive Pride's Purge and sit in the Rump. He seems to have been accepted as the spokesman for North Wales in many of the administrative committees that took over the country after the overthrow of the Monarchy, being twice elected to the Council of State, and also serving on the Committee of Both Kingdoms from 1648. However, he was not a member of the smaller council established after Cromwell assumed the Protectorate in 1653. In 1656 Trevor was elected MP for Arundel in the Second Protectorate Parliament, and was one of those advocating the offer of the Crown to Cromwell (to whom he was related by his son's marriage to John Hampden's daughter, Ruth). He was elected MP for Steyning in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament. Restoration Although he resumed his seat at Grampound in 1659 in the restored Rump after Richard Cromwell's fall, he was an early supporter of the Restoration of Charles II, which ensured that he suffered no penalties for his earlier political loyalties after the King returned, being granted a royal pardon on 24 July 1660. However, he had invested much of his fortune during the Commonwealth in buying up lands confiscated from convicted Royalists, and suffered considerable loss as a result. Family Trevor's son, also called Sir John Trevor (1626‚Äì1672), was an MP with his father during the Commonwealth, and after the Restoration rose to become Secretary of State in 1668.

Kelley was coach of the Boston College Eagles ice hockey team for 36 years. Kelley won the 1949 NCAA ice hockey title and was the first coach to win 500 games in the NCAA. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1974  Career  Kelley arrived at Boston College in 1925 after attending Boston College High School. He was a two sport athlete for the Eagles, playing both baseball and ice hockey. Kelley finished his collegiate playing career following his graduation in 1930. Kelley‚Äôs graduation came just after hockey was removed from as a varsity sport due to the Great Depression. On January 8, 1933 Kelley agreed to coach a group of BC students while he was completing his teaching at Cambridge Latin. The position offered no pay, and forced him to give up playing with the Boston Hockey Club, but it was the beginning of a career that would last until 1972. Kelley‚Äôs coaching career was put on hold with the outbreak of World War II. In 1942 Kelley joined the United States Navy and remained enlisted until 1946, before returning to coaching. Just three years after serving with the Navy Kelley lead his Boston College team over Dartmouth and win the NCAA National Championship. It would be the first championship won by an Eastern school. The 1949 National Championship was the only one of his career, however he would lead the Eagles back to the title game in 1965. Boston College lost the championship game to Michigan Tech 8-2. On December 26, 1952 Boston‚Äôs famous Beanpot Tournament was established. Kelley enjoyed great success in the tournament winning 5 of the first 10. Some have pointed to his success in the Beanpot leading to Kelley gaining his stature as the face of BC hockey. Kelley coached BC to eight Beanpot titles in thirteen years, including three in a row from 1963-65. In addition to the National Championship and his Beanpot wins Kelley also racked up an impressive amount of accolades including: eight New England Championships, nine appearances in the ECAC Division I playoffs, one ECAC playoff title and nine NCAA Tournament appearances. Kelley won the Spencer Penrose Award as College Hockey's Coach of the Year in 1959 and 1972. His success at BC earned him the nickname \\"Dean of American College Hockey Coaches\\". In a February 23, 1972 game against rival Boston University Kelley earned his 500th win making him the first NCAA Division-I men's hockey coach to reach that mark. For his career Kelley posted a record of 501-243-15 in his 36-year career. His 501 wins would remain a school record until current coach Jerry York, who played for Kelley from 1963 to 1967, passed him in 2014. Kelley had spent most 41 of the first 47 years of his adult life on the Heights as either a player or coach. In 1970 Kelley was inducted into the Boston College Varsity Club Athletic Hall of Fame. Two years later, in 1972, Kelley received the Lester Patrick Trophy for his contribution to hockey in the United States, not only for his accomplishments on the ice but also because he steadfastly refused to recruit players from Canada. Kelley felt recruiting Canadians would deprive Americans of a chance to develop their hockey potential. In 1974 Kelley be inducted in the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. On April 10, 1986 following a long bout with an illness John \\"Snooks\\" Kelley died, he was 78 years old.

It is situated in the hills of the Beaujolais wine-growing countryside in the Rh√¥ne department of the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region. Location Ville-sur-Jarnioux is part of the Pierres Dor√©es (golden stone) group of villages in the Beaujolais. The Pierres Dor√©es area comprises 38 communes where the homes and vineyard buildings were traditionally built from a local limestone rock that is naturally tinted with iron oxide, giving it a golden yellow colour. Ville- sur-Jarnioux is one a number of villages that contained an active quarry, and limited supplies of the golden stone are still quarried today. The village is surrounded by 6 other communes of Cogny to the north, Jarnioux in the valley to the east, Theiz√© to the south and Oingt, Saint-Laurent-d'Oingt and Sainte- Paule to the west. Ville-sur-Jarnioux is just 10 kilometres west of the A6 Autoroute du Soleil. The nearest stations on the high speed TGV train network are Macon-Loch√© outside Macon about 40 kilometres to the north and Part-Dieu in Lyon about the same distance to the south. Topography The village of Ville-sur-Jarnioux is shaped in the form of a diamond of which the lowest point is to the southeast at a height of 305m and the highest point to the northwest at a height of 773m. The topography is mainly composed of hillsides occupied by vines with forests covering the crests of the hills. Around and above the village are views to the east of the nearest town of Villefranche- sur-Sa√¥ne and the plain of Ain beyond. On clear days, the French Alps with Mont Blanc stretch along the horizon. Agriculture A quarter of Ville-sur- Jarnioux's land area is cultivated and mostly taken up by vineyards that produce wine of the Beaujolais appellation. The Gamay grape is grown for red wine and the Chardonnay grape for white wine. As in some other wine-growing areas of France, the local agriculture has become more diverse with vines replaced by crops such as corn, wheat and animal feed as the nation acts to reduce excessive wine output. A small part of the land is used for grazing for goats and cattle that produce local dairy products, as well as for horses and donkeys. The quarrying of the golden stone is the only industry of historical significance in the village, other than forges and an agricultural machinery workshop that was active until the 1990s. Architecture ;Church of Saint- Martin The church of Saint-Martin dates from the 12th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 18th centuries. The original bell tower, no longer in existence, was of Romanesque origin. The choir and the nave are of vaulted construction with ogive arches in the later Gothic style. Among the records of the Abbey of Savigny in northern France is the first reference to the church in 889 and the mention of a Benedictine oratory in 995. The present church was constructed from the 12th century on the foundations of the oratory, as mentioned in the records of the Abbey of Ainay of Lyon. The church and its attached buildings were recognized by Popes Eug√®ne III in 1153 and Innocent IV in 1250. Records of repairs carried out in 1469 and 1657 indicate that the church was placed under the patronage of Saint Martin of Tours. In 1701, the parish priest of the village, Raymond Crottet, noted the demolition of the original bell tower in the parish register. The year 1703 is engraved on a stone of the new bell tower together with the coat of arms of Gratien M√©nardeau, Seigneur of Jarnioux, that became the coat of arms of the village. Serious deterioration of the church's structural fabric led to major repairs in 1987, 1991 and 2005. Inside the church, visitors can see murals painted by an anonymous Austrian during the war of 1814. ;Chapel of Saint-Roch The chapel of Saint-Roch dates from the 16th century. The Archbishop of Lyon authorized the construction of the chapel on 16 July 1522. It was initially built for prayer to ward off the plague and is dedicated to Saint Roch who had a reputation for curing the disease. ;Chapel of Saint-Clair The chapel of Saint-Clair was built between the 14th and 16th centuries. There is a possibility that the original site harboured a group of Templars in a priory that was replaced by the present chapel. Construction of the chapel appears to have begun in the 14th century at a time that coincided with the eradication of the Templar knights. It is certain that the chapel was rebuilt before 1773 as a petition dated that year mentions the work. The entrance and main fa√ßade date from the 15th and 16th centuries. Beaujolais Railway The Beaujolais Railway (Chemin de fer du Beaujolais) no longer exists but the route of its tracks is still present on the hillsides of the village. Built in 1898 and removed in 1934, there were two lines that ran from Villefranche to Monsels and Tarare. Ville-sur-Jarnioux was on the Tarare line and the station building still exists in the village. Today the old railway line is a favourite route for hikers, ramblers and cyclists.

The first mention of the settlement of Saint-Genis dates back to 807, a year the archbishop Leidrade donated to the hospitals of Saint-Roman and Saint-Genis. In 984 the parish of Saint-Genis was first mentioned as part of properties of the archbishop of Lyon, in the census of the 52 parishes of the metropolitan Church in Lyon. Little by little, the archbishop assigned his belongings to the Canons of the Lyon Cathedral. The canons would go on to build a castle on the highest part of the village, where the church now stands. In the 13th century they fortified the village, and in 1447 they rebuilt the surrounding wall. The current layout of the city center still features an ancient tower in the garden of the vicarage (for a long time a prison) between the delimitation of the medieval village and the remnants of the wall, ; the northern port (restored in the 18th century) and, ensconced in houses, the rue des Halles.Des villages de Cassini aux communes d'aujourd'hui [archive] sur le site de l'√âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales. The cannons of Saint- Jean held a fortified manor, in the territory of Laye, where Pope Clement V went to repose in 1306, after his coronation in the Church of Saint-Just √† Lyon. Nothing remains of the manor. From the 13th century onward the pilgrimage to Notre-Dame-de-Beaunant attracted crowds: there remains a chapel there, rebuilt at the end of the previous century at the site of the miraculous spring. In November 1434, Saint-Genis was occupied by the Burgundians. The castle of Beauregard, the residence of Thomas de Gedagne, a Florentine banker, received King Charles IX of France and his court in 1564. Of the castle, only a few parts of the wall remain, but the gardens, terraces, and Nymphaeum still suggest an idea of the place's beauty. Today it is a municipal park.

Unsuccessful in his first attempt at a by-election on March 14, 1871, and defeated at the general election of 1882, he once again offered and was elected in 1886, and was subsequently returned to the Provincial Legislature in 1890, 1892, 1895, and again in 1899 and sat as a member until the dissolution of the house in 1903. He retired from political life at the age of seventy-nine and returned to Bayside, Charlotte County, NB. He was born in Bayside, New Brunswick, of Scottish descent, and was educated there. His grandfather was one of many Castine Loyalists who received land grants in 1783. In 1851, he married Agnes McDouall, the daughter of Alexander McDouall and Margaret Cumming McDouall of High Curghie, Scotland. They had two sons: James Alexander Russell and John McDouall Russell.

It is bounded by Lake Street to the north, Ida B. Wells Drive to the south, State Street to the west and Wabash Avenue to the east. The district has the highest density of National Historic Landmark, National Register of Historic Places and Chicago Landmark designated buildings in Chicago. It hosts several historic buildings including former department store flagship locations Marshall Field and Company Building (now Macy's at State Street), and the Sullivan Center (formerly Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building). It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 1998. (includes map of district) It includes 74 contributing buildings and structures, including 13 separately listed Registered Historic Places, and 22 non-contributing buildings. Other significant buildings in the district include the Joffrey Tower, Chicago Theatre, Palmer House, and Page Brothers Building. It also hosts DePaul University's College of Commerce, which includes the Kellstadt Graduate School of Business and the Robert Morris College. The district is most commonly associated with department store buildings. In its heyday the district hosted seven prominent department stores from which six buildings remain today. These include the aforementioned Marshall Field and Company Building, and Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Buildings as well as the National Register of Historic Places A. M. Rothschild & Company Store (pic) at 333 S. State St. The other department store buildings are contributing properties. History Potter Palmer The district's period of historic significance was 1872-1949. In the late 1860s, Potter Palmer improved State Street by building his own Palmer House hotel on State Street in 1870. He had also convinced Marshall Field and Levi Leiter to move the Field, Leiter & Co. store to State Street in 1868. Chicago's retailing center was State Street (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the downtown Loop after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Convenient mass transit such as streetcars and elevated trains, supported a retail corridor along State Street from Lake Street to Van Buren Street. State Street became a shopping destination during the 1900s, and is referred to in Frank Sinatra's song Chicago (That Toddlin' Town), where Frank refers it to \\"State Street, that Great Street.\\" At one time seven major department stores were situated on State Street: Benson & Rixon, Karolls, Charles A. Stevens and Mandel Brothers (in addition to Marshall Field's and Carson, Pirie Scott). However Chicago evolved and by the 1920s, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts. After 1950, suburban development reduced the role of the Loop's daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped. However, the Magnificent Mile kept a luxury shopping district close to the central business district. In 1979, Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne converted the downtown portion into a pedestrian mall with only bus traffic allowed. Mayor Richard M. Daley oversaw the State Street Revitalization Project and on November 15, 1996, the street was reopened to traffic. In addition, the Chicago Transit Authority Red Line serves State Street and the elevated trains of the Chicago 'L' serve Wabash and Lake streets in this district. Current revitalization is catering to the mix of student residents and other new residents with the newly available residential spaces.

Early Life Hind was born to Archibald Taylor (Archie Sr.) Hind and Margaret Duff Hind (n√©e Miller). He is known to have had two siblings, Allan and John Hind, and a younger sister. Raised in poverty in the Carntyne district of Glasgow, Hind's father, Archie Sr., a stoker on locomotive engines, seemingly had psychological problems which, coupled with other frustrtions, led to frequent incidents of domestic violence. Archie Jr. often had to avoid the public baths because of his bruises caused by the meting out of his father's violence against the familyhttps://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12458511.archie-hind/. Due to financial hardship, Hind was under pressure to leave school and take on menial jobs, eventually being called up to serve in the medical corps in Singapore and Ceylon at the end of World War II. After he was demobbed, he was determined to become a writer. His big break came when he was accepted in 1950‚Äì51 to study a creative course at Newbattle Abbey College, Midlothian, where the principal, Orcadian poet Edwin Muir, reportedly became his mentor and helped inspire him. Life and work The Dear Green Place, published in 1966, was his only completed work , but it won four major awards and has been listed as one of the best 100 Scottish novels of all time.100 Best Scottish Books, The List, January 2005. The title refers to a colloquial nickname for Hind's birthplace and hometown of Glasgow. Many references are made within the novel to Hind's wife, Eleanor, as the character 'Helen', as well as her parents John and Sonia Slane (n√©e Zam), whose characters are portrayed in the story as well off, intellectual, and disapproving. Slane's family, the Zams, were Russian Jews who had fled the Pogroms in the Ukraine, arriving in Scotland between 1904‚Äì1912, and settling at first in Glasgow. It was unusual for anyone to 'marry out' to a gentile and it was often met with opposition; even sometimes resulting in excommunication from a family. Given that the novel was largely biographical, most of these elements of the story are true to actual events. The success of the novel turned Hind from a trolleybus driver and former slaughterhouse worker into a successful and notable writer. He won 1966's Guardian First Book Award. Hind went on to publish journalistic articles and wrote several plays and theatrical revues, notably for Glasgow's Citizen's Theatre. Fur Sadie The Dear Green Place had a number of reprintings over the decades, and was again reprinted in March 2008 published in conjunction with Hind's incomplete novel, Fur Sadie, as two novels in one volume. Hind had worked on Fur Sadie for decades without finishing it, and the manuscript was assumed to have been lost or destroyed until it was rediscovered and edited by family acquaintance, the poet, writer and artist Alasdair Gray and journalist/literary agent John Linklater. Originally titled F√ºr Sadie, because Hind was influenced by Beethoven's piece F√ºr Elise, the umlaut was later dropped to reflect Glasgow dialect. The story centers around the character of Sadie, a housewife in the Parkhead district of Glasgow who rediscovers her childhood love for the piano as a means of escaping her middle-aged misery. Personal Life Archie Hind was survived by his wife of 56 years, Eleanor (n√©e Slane), sons Callum and Martin, and daughters Sheila and Helen. A third son, Gavin, died in a road accident in 1974 at the age of 23. Hind also had a number of grandchildren and great grandchildren. The family also had a strong interest in political action tied into their working- class roots; Hind was often referred to as \\"Trotsky\\" due to his Socialist beliefs https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/29/culture.obituaries. Death Hind died from cancer, aged 79, on 21 February 2008. He had been due to appear on 7 March 2008 with famous writers from around the world at the Aye Write! literary festival in Glasgow's Mitchell Library to mark the reprinting of The Dear Green Place, along with the Fur Sadie manuscript and examples of his writing.

The line uses superseded tracks of the Sagano Line (officially a portion of the San'in Main Line) of JR West, from in Arashiyama, and passes a gorge offering a scenic view along the Hozu River, then enters and terminates in the basin of Kameoka. It is closed on Wednesdays and in the winter. The line is locally known as \\"Torokko in Hozu gorge\\".

The company adopted the relatively level route through the gorge, avoiding pass which would have required a steep grade. The company was nationalized in 1907. The line became a part of the San'in Main Line. =Bypass= JR West, succeeding the Japanese National Railways (JNR), built a new, shorter, straighter, electrified double- tracked section of the Sanin Main Line between Saga (present ) and which opened in 1989, bypassing the original winding route with narrow tunnels. =Success= JR West utilised the original line for tourism under a subsidiary founded in 1990. JR West used old rolling stock for this purpose; four semi-open coaches hauled by a diesel locomotive. By 1991, the line was more popular than expected (there had been speculation that the venture would be unsuccessful). As a result, a fifth carriage, nicknamed , was introduced. The car is contrary to its name, converted from an old gondola of JR West to fully open carriage, even the floor and the sides are of fine grills and offers a rough ride. Combined with rafting on the Hozu River, it is a major tourist attraction in Arashiyama and Sagano. Operation All trains are operated between Torokko Saga and Torokko Kameoka stations.

Some are sold on the day, but travel in \\"The Rich\\" is not available on rainy days.

It is likely that Marchia's lectures were transcribed by his students, which he edited resulting in several versions of his commentary in manuscript form.Robiglio, Andrea A. \\"How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will.\\" Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print. Before leaving for Avignon around 1324 to teach at a Franciscan convent, Marchia composed several scholarly commentaries, including two on Aristotle's Metaphysics and one on Physics. The Quodlibet was written afterwards, between 1324 and 1328.Friedman, Russell L., Schabel, Chris. \\"Introduction.\\" Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 1-20. Print. Marchia supported the Franciscan Minister General, Michael of Cesena, and renounced Pope John XXII‚Äôs concept of poverty in 1328. Following the renunciation he fled with Michael and William of Ockham to Munich. The Improbatio, a rebuttal to the Pope's Papal bull titled Quia vir reprobus, was written during this time, as well as the Allegationes Religiosorum Vivorum, co-authored by Marchia and Ockham and assembled by Michael.Lambertini, Roberto. \\"Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue.\\" Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print. In 1343 Marchia repented and died shortly after. Philosophy =Property Rights= In the Improbatio, Francis of Marchia focuses on determining when and where property rights originated to support the Franciscan belief that Christ lived in absolute poverty. He distinguishes between two types of dominia: the dominium before the fall and the dominium after. The dominium before the fall, also known as the dominion of the prelapsarian state, was a time where all of God's creatures rejoiced in happiness, were deeply connected to one another, and shared in God's creation. The dominium after the fall was caused by the first sin of Adam, making the issue of property rights distinctly human.Lambertini, Roberto. Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print. The Pope had denied that the origin of property was linked to humans, claiming that it was sin itself that was the cause. Marchia agreed that without sin there would be no property rights, however, sin did not immediately bring about the concept of property. Francis maintained it was human law that was responsible for the formation of property rights, not Divine law, and used the story of Cain and Abel, citing Cain's corrupted will to support his belief.Lambertini, Roberto. Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print. =Projectile Motion= Francis of Marchia's theory of projectile motion, referred to as virtus derelicta, is described in the sections of his commentaries on Sentences explaining the consecration of the Eucharist. Virtus derelicta states: the motion of an object is caused by a force left behind by the object that acted upon it. Unlike the theory of inertia meant to explain natural phenomenon, Marchia formulates virtus derelicta to be an all-inclusive explanation of both natural and supernatural phenomena.Zanin, Fabio. Francis of Marchia, Virtus Derelicta, and Modifications of the Basic Principles of Aristotelian Physics. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 81-95. Print. Virtus derelicta explains several different kinds of motion ‚Äì perpetual and finite - and is meant to account for unnatural changes. Key elements of virtus derelicta include: *An object is put in motion by another object, which leaves virtus derelicta in the moving object. *At the beginning of any given motion, virtus derelicta can work with or against the natural disposition of the object in motion. *If it works against the moving object, virtus derelicta will dissipate and eventually leave the body, ceasing motion. *If it works with the moving object, virtus derelicta stays in the object causing the potential for perpetual motion. There are several philosophers before Marchia's time, such as Richard Rufus of Cornwall from the 13th century, that seem to form their own versions of virtus derelicta, so it is unclear whether this theory truly originated from Marchia. It is evident, however, that philosophers such as Jean Buridan and Gerard Odonis used Marchia's theory to refine their own concepts of virtus derelicta, confirming that the Franciscan played a key role in the evolution of philosophy on physics.Schabel, Chris. Francis of Marchia's Virtus Derelicta and the Context of its Development. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 41-80. Print. =Act of the Will= Another focus of Francis of Marchia's commentary on the Sentences posed in Book II was how the will could act against reason resulting in moral culpability: whether the will could either act prior to, or against rational judgment. Marchia argued that the will is the cause of action. After a judgment is made, the will decides to act either in accordance with that judgment or against it. The will constitutes the middle term between judgment and action. Without it, the judgment would necessitate action, negating the concept of free will and moral culpability. In addition, the will is under a law that obliges it to perform good acts. Without this obligation there would be no sin.Robiglio, Andrea A. How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print. To answer how the will could go against this obligation, Marchia distinguishes between apprehensive and a judicative acts. Apprehensive acts are necessary for the will to function, and are result of intellectual cognitions and judgments. Judicative acts are formed from more complex knowledge where reasoning is judiciously applied. Volition does not require judicative acts to be performed, which explains how humans are able to sin. In other words, the will does not depend on rational judgment.Robiglio, Andrea A. How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print. To avoid the objection that judgment is required for reasoning and cannot be ignored in the deliberative process, Marchia offers a further distinction between apprehensive and judicative knowledge, and two types of rational reflective judgments. These distinctions allow for one judgment to be selected over another due to the strength it receives from being selected by the will.Robiglio, Andrea A. How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print.

It is located 15 km north of Paris, the capital. Boundaries The commune is bounded with Montmorency, Saint-Brice-sous-For√™t, Sarcelles, Deuil- la-Barre and Montmagny. History The name comes from Graua, a Gaulish word, that means \\"terrain with pebbles\\". The nature of the soil was particularly favorable for wine growing, which was exploited here from antiquity until the late 19th century phylloxera epidemic. The name was first mentioned in an act of donations from the Abbey of Saint-Denis in 862. The first master of Groslay was Odon or √âudes of Groslay in the late 11th century. In the 13th century, the village became a fief of the House of Montmorency, in the 17th century of the House of Cond√©. The commune was essentially about wine which was produced until the early 20th century. Groslay has seen similar developments as neighbouring Montmorency: construction of country houses in the 18th century, middle class houses in the 19th century, and garden city urbanization in the 20th century. Groslay hasn't been subjected to large scale urbanization in the 1960s and the 1970s unlike many of its neighbours. The municipal park and the square in front of the town hall were completely renovated in 2007.

The lesions are usually, but not always, made in the frontal lobes. Tissue may be destroyed by cutting, burning, freezing, electric current or radiation. The first systematic attempt at psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt who operated on six patients in 1888. In 1889 Thomas Claye Shaw reported mental improvement in a case of General Paralysis of the Insane after a neurosurgical intervention. This led to a lively debate in the British Medical Journal on the usefulness of neurosurgery for the treatment of insanity.Berrios G E (1997) The Origins of Psychosurgery: Shaw, Burckhardt and Moniz. History of Psychiatry 8: 61‚Äì81. In the 1930s the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz developed a surgical technique for the treatment of mental illness and called it \\"leucotomy\\" or \\"psychosurgery\\".Z Kotowicz 2005 Gottlieb Burckhardt and Egas Moniz ‚Äì Two Beginnings of Psychosurgery. Gesnerus 62: 77‚Äì101. Moniz' technique was adapted and promoted by American neurologist Walter Freeman and his neurosurgeon colleague James W. Watts. They called their operation, where burr holes are drilled in the side of the skull and the white matter is sliced through in order to sever the connections between the frontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain, lobotomy. In the United Kingdom it became known as the standard Freeman-Watts prefrontal leucotomy. British psychiatrist William Sargant met Freeman on a visit to the United States and on his return to England encouraged doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol to instigate a programme of psychosurgery.P Fennell 1996 Treatment without consent: law, psychiatry and the treatment of mentally disordered people since 1845. Routledge: 144-5. The first British psychosurgical operation was performed in Bristol in December 1940,FL Golla 1943 The technique and range of prefrontal leucotomy. Journal of Mental Science 89: 189‚Äì91. and by the end of 1944 about 1,000 operations had been carried out in the United Kingdom.Board of Control 1947 Prefrontal Leucotomy in 1,000 cases. HMSO. By 1954 that figure had risen to about 12,000 with use peaking in 1949.GC Tooth and MP Newton. 1961 Leucotomy in England and Wales 1942‚Äì1954. HMSO: 2‚Äì4. Beginning in the 1940s doctors devised \\"modified operations\\" with less extensive cuts or more specific targets (for example, rostral leucotomy and cingulotomy) in an attempt to reduce the damage done by the surgery. During the 1950s the number of operations declined by more than half, in spite of the fact that Moniz had received a Nobel Prize for psychosurgery in 1949. Reasons for this decline included increasing concern about the deaths and damage caused by the operation, the introduction of neuroleptic drugs, and changing ideas about the nature and treatment of mental illness.J Pippard 1962 Leucotomy in Britain today. Journal of Mental Science 108: 249‚Äì55.WS Maclay 1953 Death due to treatment. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine 46:13‚Äì20. By the mid-1970s the use of psychosurgery had declined still further to about 100‚Äì150 operations a year, and nearly all were of the modified type.BM Barraclough and NA Mitchell-Heggs 1978 Use of neurosurgery for psychological disorder in British Isles during 1974‚Äì6. British Medical Journal 2: 1591‚Äì3. The Mental Health Act 1983 specified that psychosurgery could only be carried out on consenting patients, and then only with the approval of the Mental Health Act Commission. The decline in psychosurgery has continued to 2007, with the latest figures from the Mental Health Act Commission showing that 5 operations were authorised in Wales in the 2-year period 2005‚Äì2007.Mental Health Act Commission 2008 Twelfth biennial report. Stationery Office. A few operations every year are also performed in Dundee, Scotland. No psychosurgical operations were performed in England between 1999 and 2009; one operation was performed in 2010 in Bristol. In total, over 20,000 people have undergone psychosurgical operations in the United Kingdom. Women have outnumbered men (by about three to two in the early days, and by even more in recent years). The vast majority of operations have been carried out on young and middle-aged adults, although some older people and, in the past, a very small number of children and teenagers have been operated on. Nowadays the operation is used in the treatment of depression, anxiety and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder. In the past it was also used in the treatment of schizophrenia and a wide variety of other disorders; some patients had been in a mental hospital for years before operation, others only briefly or not at all. Pioneers of psychosurgery in the UK The first leucotomies in the UK were carried out at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol and were a collaboration between Frederick Golla, director of the Burden Neurological Institute, Effie Hutton, clinical director of the Burden Neurological Institute, surgeon F. Wilfred Willway, and the medical superintendents of Barnwood House in Gloucester and Brislington House in Bristol, who volunteered their patients as guinea pigs. Frederick Golla was persuaded to undertake the surgery by psychiatrist William Sargant who had seen three of Freeman's patients in the US and tried to introduce leucotomy at the Belmont Hospital in London, only to be refused permission by London County Council. The first operation was carried out in December 1940, a further eight over the next four months ‚Äì all of them on detained patients. The operations were done with a paper knife, using the standard Freeman-Watts technique. Some were performed under local anaesthesia, some under general. After nine operations the psychiatrists presented the results of the first eight operations in an article in The Lancet in July 1941, omitting the ninth case where a blood vessel was cut and the patient, a 27-year-old woman, died. Of the eight, one died of a heart attack two days after the operation, three were discharged (two of them still suffering from incontinence) and four remained in hospital. One of the discharged patients, a veteran of World War I who had broken down during the bombing raids on Bristol and had been diagnosed as neurotic, was operated on after just 4 days in hospital. These results were considered sufficiently encouraging for the leucotomy programme to continue at the Burden Neurological Institute, and for Sargant to gain permission to introduce leucotomy at the Belmont Hospital in London.

One patient died.JS McGregor and JR Crumbie 1941 Surgical treatment of mental diseases. The Lancet, 5 July: 7‚Äì8. Surgeon John Crumbie designed his own leucotome (instrument for cutting the white matter in the brain) which was constructed by Warlingham's assistant clerk of works, and referred to by Wylie McKissock, who operated with a Cushing brain needle, as a \\"mechanical egg-whisk\\".W McKissock 1943 The technique of pre-frontal leucotomy.

Journal of Mental Science 88: 534‚Äì40. After the results of at the Burden Neurological Institute and Warlingham Park were published, mental hospitals throughout Great Britain began to use psychosurgery. Pioneering hospitals included: Crichton Royal Hospital, Dumfries, Scotland: 142 patients had undergone surgery by the end of 1945. Most of them were judged to be \\"hopeless, chronic invalids\\" and were selected for surgery on account of being prone to aggressive, destructive and impulsive behaviour.JNP Moore 1946 Discussion: prefrontal leucotomy with reference to indications and results.

Runwell Hospital, Essex: psychiatrist Rolf Strom- Olsen and surgeon Geoffrey Knight formed a psychosurgery partnership that was to last for thirty years. 116 operations had been carried out by the end of 1945, with six deaths. The first few patients had been selected for what Knight called their \\"low potential\\", so that harmful effects could be studied before the operation was used in cases of \\"higher potentiality\\".R Strom-Olsen 1946 Discussion: prefrontal leucotomy with reference to indications and results.

McKissock developed a peripatetic psychosurgery service, visiting hospitals all over the south of England (except for part of Kent, which was the territory of Knight) and Wales on Saturdays and performing thousands of leucotomies.LC Cook 1946 Discussion: prefrontal leucotomy with reference to indications and results. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine 34: 449‚Äì51. The North Wales Hospital, Denbigh: Leucotomy was introduced in 1942. The first series of 24 patients operated on 1942‚Äì1944 were selected for their failure to respond to other treatments (usually electroconvulsive therapy) and, in at least half the cases, the demands they made on nursing staff. Operations were done by a local GP/general surgeon. One patient died.D Crossley 1993 The introduction of leucotomy: a British case history. History of Psychiatry 4: 553‚Äì64. Netherne Hospital, Coulsdon, Surrey: in 1942 Eric Cunningham Dax, medical superintendent of Netherne Hospital, called in surgeon Eric Radley Smith to operate on patients. Before the year was out, fifty patients had undergone surgery, and in April 1943 the results were published in the Journal of Mental Science. Cunningham Dax described how he selected patients: > \\"The operation was carried out with the primary object of relieving the most > disturbed patients in the hospital quite independently of their poor > prognosis. They formed a large proportion of the most violent, hostile, > noisy, excited, destructive or obscene cases in the hospital; the type who > distress their relatives, upset the other patients and consume the time and > energy which could be put to so much better purpose by the staff\\".E > Cunningham Dax and EJ Radley Smith 1943 The early effects of prefrontal > leucotomy on disturbed patients with mental illness of long duration. > Journal of Mental Science 89: 182‚Äì8. Two died of cerebral haemorrhage, two were discharged (of whom one relapsed); of those remaining in hospital two-thirds had shown at least some improvement, needing less staff time and supervision. St Lawrence's Hospital, Caterham, Surrey: in March 1944 a programme of leucotomy was begun on \\"mental defectives\\". Crumbie operated on one patient, McKissock and his assistant, McCall, on a further 43 (nine of them under the age of 21). There were five deaths and the majority of patients showed little or no improvement, with twelve of them becoming worse. Doctors at St Lawrence's Hospital decided to abandon the experiment.M Engler. Prefrontal leucotomy in mental defectives. 1948 Journal of Mental Science 94: 844‚Äì50. Rampton Hospital, another mental deficiency institution, began using psychosurgery in January 1947. Twenty patients including a fourteen-year-old underwent surgery in little over a year. One patient died.GW Mackay 1948 Leucotomy in the treatment of psychopathic feeble-minded patients in a state mental deficiency institution. Journal of Mental Science 94: 834‚Äì41. Superintendent George Mackay found the results sufficiently encouraging to extend the programme to include \\"a wider group of clinical types\\". One young woman who underwent a leucotomy turned out to have been detained illegally for eighteen years.Times, 2 April 1957: 5; 9 April 1957: 13. By the end of 1944 about 1,000 psychosurgical operations had been performed in Great Britain, and the Board of Control published the results of a survey in a 30-page booklet. They described the operation in the following terms: > Crudely described the purpose of the operation is to break the connection > between the patient‚Äôs thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve the > connection between the patient‚Äôs thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve > mental tension, to take the sting out of experience and thus to favour > improvement or to hasten recovery from mental disorder. Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting that they always occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration.C Allen 1949 (2nd edition, 1st edition 1937) Modern discoveries in medical psychology. MacMillan: 227. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly as a result of the operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long were much more likely to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer. Advances in surgical technique Beginning in the early 1940s, psychiatrists and surgeons experimented with different techniques of psychosurgery, mainly in order to reduce the risk of death, complications and severe personality damage associated with the operation and thus extend its use to depressed and neurotic patients.W Sargant 1953 Ten years experience of modified leucotomy operations. British Medical Journal 2: 800‚Äì3. =Transorbital leucotomy= Transorbital leucotomy (transorbital lobotomy in the US) was a technique invented by Italian psychiatrist Amarro Fiamberti and taken up by American neurologist Walter Freeman, with whose name it is particularly associated. Instead of holes being drilled in the skull, a sharp instrument was hammered through the roof of the eye-socket (the orbital plate) and then swung through the white matter in the frontal lobes. The advantages of the method were that the services of a neurosurgeon could be dispensed with (Freeman also dispensed with the services of an anaesthetist, as he used electroconvulsive shock to produce unconsciousness) and the restricted cut produced fewer personality changes.W Freeman 1948 Transorbital leucotomy. The Lancet, 4 September: 371-3. On a visit to England in July 1948 Freeman read a paper on his new technique at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, and in September the paper was published in The Lancet. Transorbital leucotomy did not become widely used in the UK, but a few psychiatrists experimented with it. John Walsh at Tone Vale Hospital in Somerset operated on eight women in 1949, on three occasions (including one as a demonstration at a meeting of the south-western division of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association) using electroconvulsive shock as an anaesthetic. Walsh was disappointed with the results, finding \\"no definite clinical improvements\\" in any of the patients.J Walsh 1949 Transorbital leucotomy: some results and observations. The Lancet, 10 September: 465-6. Psychiatrist Alan Edwards at Napsbury Hospital in Hertfordshire performed transorbital leucotomies with conventional anaesthesia on 71 patients between February 1949 and February 1950, and found it less effective than a standard leucotomy.AM Edwards 1950 Journal of Mental Science 96ii: 935-50. By mid 1952, 7 deaths due to cerebral haemorrhage during transorbital leucotomy had been reported to the Board of Control. =Rostral leucotomy= Rostral leucotomy, in which holes were drilled in the top of the skull and the cut made in a downwards direction, was devised by McKissock. Although McKissock approached from the opposite direction, the cut was similar to that of Freeman's transorbital leucotomy, undercutting Brodmann's areas 9 and 10 of the frontal cortex.E Beck, T McLardy and A Meyer 1950 Anatomical comments on psychosurgical procedures. Journal of Mental Science 96i: 157-67. McKissock was scornful of transorbital operations, considering them an offence \\"against established aseptic principles\\".W McKissock 1951 Rostral leucotomy. The Lancet, 21 July: 91-4. McKissock continued to use the standard prefrontal operation where the aim was to control the behaviour of disturbed patients. In 1957, for example, he performed 125 rostral and 19 standard leucotomies.W McKissock 1959 Discussion of Psychosurgery. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine 52: 203‚Äì10. =Cingulotomy= Cingulotomy, where part of the anterior cingulate gyrus is destroyed, was pioneered in Great Britain in 1948 by Hugh Cairns, first Nuffield Professor of Surgery at the University of Oxford.GJ Fraenkel 1991 Hugh Cairns: first Nuffield Professor of Surgery, University of Oxford. Oxford University Press: 207-9.CWM Whitty and JE Duffield 1952 Anterior cingulotomy. The Lancet, 8 March: 475-81. Similar operations accounted for 10 per cent of psychosurgical operations in the United Kingdom in the mid-1970s. In recent years stereotactic anterior cingulotomies have been performed by the psychosurgical unit at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland. =Subcaudate tractotomy= In 1949 Knight at Runwell Hospital started performing the operation of orbital undercutting (called orbital leucotomy in Britain) devised by American surgeon William Beecher Scoville, in which the lower quadrants of the frontal lobes were cut via holes in the forehead.GC Knight and RF Tredgold 1955 Orbital leucotomy: a review of 52 cases. The Lancet, 14 May: 981-6. Knight later modified Scoville's operation to restrict the cut to the lower medial quadrants.GC Knight 1960 330 cases of restricted orbital cortical undercutting. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine 53: 728. Further modifications dating from 1961 included the use of a stereotactic frame and brain images to make it easier to navigate in the frontal lobes, and the use of radioactive seeds (up to 20) to destroy tissue in the subcaudate region.PK Bridges et al. 1994 Psychosurgery: stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, an indispensable treatment. British Journal of Psychiatry 165: 599‚Äì611. The operation was then called stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy and by the mid-1970s, although only used at two neurosurgical units (which by that time had replaced mental hospitals as the sites for psychosurgical operations), it accounted for 30 per cent of operations in the United Kingdom. Knight operated at the Brook Hospital in South London in collaboration with retired psychiatrist Strom-Olsen and then with psychiatrist Paul Bridges. Knight retired in the early 1970s (the unit was named the Geoffrey Knight psychosurgical unit in his honour) and was replaced by John Bartlett. In all, nearly 1300 subcaudate tractotomies were carried out at the Brook Hospital, with one death attributed wholly to the operation. During the 1980s the unit accounted for over 75 per cent of the psychosurgical operations carried out in Britain. The unit ceased operating in 1994. A team at Kings College Hospital under psychiatrist Stuart Checkley took over the work of the unit and performed 23 stereotactic subcaudate tractotomies over the next five years, using radiofrequency to destroy brain tissue.Royal College of Psychiatrists 2000 Neurosurgery for mental disorder. Royal College of Psychiatrists, London: 47. =Capsulotomy= Capsulotomy, or anterior capsulotomy, in which part of the internal capsule in the frontal lobe is destroyed, was first used in France in the late 1940s and used extensively in Sweden.C Ruck et al. 2003 Capsulotomy for refractory anxiety disorders: long-term follow-up of 26 patients. American Journal of Psychiatry 160: 513‚Äì21. Since the early 1990s stereotactic anterior capsulotomies been performed at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland, and at the University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff, Wales.Mental Health Act Commission 1993 Fifth biennial report, 1991‚Äì1993. HMSO: 35-6. =Limbic leucotomy= Limbic leucotomy was developed in the early 1970s by surgeon Alan Richardson at Atkinson Morley's Hospital. The operation combines stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy and cingulotomy, with up to 14 cryogenic lesions made in the brain.D Kelly and N Mitchell-Heggs 1973 Stereotactic limbic leucotomy ‚Äì a follow-up study of thirty patients. Postgraduate Medical Journal 49: 865‚Äì82. Limbic leucotomies continued to be performed at Atkinson Morley's Hospital until 1999.C Freeman 1997 Neurosurgery for mental disorder in the UK. Psychiatric Bulletin 21: 67‚Äì9.Mental Health Act Commission 1999 Eighth biennial report. The Stationery Office: 183. =Multifocal electroleucoagulation= Multifocal electroleucoagulation, in which white matter is gradually destroyed by passing electric current through electrodes implanted in the frontal lobes, was the invention of doctors at the Burden Neurological Institute in 1959. Ten sheaths, each containing six or seven electrodes, were implanted in the brain and connected to a socket on the head. Every week direct currents of 10‚Äì20 mA were passed for about 3 minutes through 2‚Äì4 selected electrodes to make electrolytic lesions.R Cooper 1977 Electrode implantation techniques. In J Sydney Smith and LG Kiloh (eds.) Psychosurgery and Society: symposium organised by the Neuropsychiatric Institute, Sydney, 26‚Äì27 September 1974. Pergamon Press: 57‚Äì66. These experiments continued throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s.H Crow 1977 In J Sydney Smith and LG Kiloh (eds.) Psychosurgery and Society: symposium organised by the Neuropsychiatric Institute, Sydney, 26‚Äì27 September 1974. Pergamon Press: 67‚Äì74. In the mid-1990s there were plans to re-introduce multifocal electrocoagulation but they came to nothing.Mental Health Act Commission 1997 Seventh biennial report. Stationery Office: 113. =Psychosurgery on the temporal lobe= In most psychosurgical operations the intention is to destroy tissue in the frontal lobes, but a few operations have been done on the temporal lobes. Amygdalotomy, which destroys the amygdala, has been performed on small numbers of people in Britain. A group of Scottish doctors in the early 1970s experimented with the operation in the treatment of aggressive behaviour. Their patients included one as young as eight, and several others aged under 20.ER Hitchcock et al. 1973 Observations on the development of an assessment scheme for amygdalotomy. In LV Laitinen and KE Livingston (eds.) Surgical approaches in psychiatry. MTP: 142-55. In England a few hypothalamotomies, where the hypothalamus is the target, were performed for the same reason. Decline of psychosurgery The use of psychosurgery in the United Kingdom peaked in the late 1940s and early 1950s, with nearly 1,500 operations a year. Although some mental hospitals never used psychosurgery, or abandoned it after a brief trial, only a few voices were raised against it in the medical literature. Retired professor James MacDonald reminded psychiatrists at the Royal Medico-Psychological Association's March 1943 symposium on pre-frontal leucotomy that the frontal lobes represented the highest form of evolution, that there was no rational basis for leucotomy, and that the operation was of questionable legality.J MacDonald 1943 Symposium of pre-frontal leucotomy: discussion. Journal of Mental Science 89: 186‚Äì8. Donald Winnicott in a letter to The Lancet in the early days of leucotomy suggested that those who wanted to perform destructive operations should first establish that mental disorders were actually \\"brain-tissue diseases\\".DW Winnicott 1943 Prefrontal leucotomy. The Lancet, 10 April: 475. Clifford Allen questioned the ethics of operating on people to make them easier to nurse and said it was little less than criminal to operate on people who were mildly or only recently ill.C Allen 1946 An examination of the physical methods of treatment in mental disease. The Medical Press and Circular, 5 June: 377. Quoted in A Scull 2005 Madhouse: a tragic tale of megalomania and modern medicine. Yale University Press: 343. Several works published in the 1950s drew attention to the damaging and sometimes fatal effects of psychosurgery, though their authors were not opposed to the treatment. Maurice Partridge's follow-up of 300 patients operated on by McKissock revealed a higher death rate than was usually acknowledged, with six per cent of patients dying wholly or partly as a result of the surgery. The book described how many patients, even those whose surgery was considered as success by their doctors, were left with serious disabilities.M Partridge 1950 Pre-frontal leucotomy: a survey of 300 cases personally followed over 1¬Ω‚Äì3 years. Blackwell Scientific Publications. Walter Maclay, president of the section of psychiatry of the Royal Society of Medicine, chose the subject of \\"death due to treatment\\" for his 1952 address. He counted 180 deaths directly resulting from leucotomy over a period of five and a half years. Also mentioned as a \\"possible lethal complication of leucotomy\\" were three murders committed by people who had undergone leucotomy. In his book Personality changes following frontal leucotomy Peter MacDonald Tow, psychiatrist at Runwell Hospital, described his search all over England for \\"normal subjects\\" ‚Äì people who in spite of having been selected for leucotomy did not have severe mental illnesses. Eventually he found sixty subjects. Several died as a result of the operation, or were left too damaged to co-operate with testing. MacDonald Tow's research on the survivors demonstrated that the operation often caused serious intellectual damage.P MacDonald Tow 1955 Personality changes following frontal leucotomy: a clinical and experimental study of the frontal lobes in man. Oxford University Press. When the Board of Control published their second survey in 1961 the use of psychosurgery had declined by more than half; the decline being attributed to an awareness of the risks of irreversible effects and the introduction in 1955 of neuroleptic drugs. By 1961 nearly half of mental hospitals in the United Kingdom were no longer carrying out leucotomies. Approximately 500 operations were performed a year, and were unevenly distributed over the country. Someone hospitalised in the North East Metropolitan region was more than 15 times more likely to undergo psychosurgery than someone hospitalised in the neighbouring East Anglian region. There were also random differences in the type of operation used and the type of illness treated. Twenty per cent of operations were still standard pre-frontal leucotomies; the rest were new operations, and a few centres used stereotactic techniques. Some hospitals still used psychosurgery to treat chronic schizophrenia, in others the only indications were depression or obsessive illness. Psychosurgery continued to decline during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1976 about 120 operations were carried out in the United Kingdom. There were still a few standard leucotomies, but by the mid-1970s stereotactic subcaudate tractotomy, cingulotomy and stereotactic limbic leucotomy accounted for more than 50 per cent of operations. Depression was the most common diagnosis; people were also operated on for anxiety, violence, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, anorexia and other diagnoses. Legislation By the early 1980s the number of psychosurgical operations carried out annually in the United Kingdom had fallen to fewer than 70. Most of them were stereotactic subcaudate tractotomies performed at the Geoffrey Knight psychosurgical unit at the Brook Hospital, London. The Mental Health Act 1983 (which covers England and Wales) classified psychosurgery as a treatment that could only be carried out with a patient's consent. Under section 57 of the Act, which applies to both detained and informal patients, a panel of three people appointed by the Mental Health Act Commission has to establish that the patient is consenting. Then the psychiatrist on the panel authorises the operation if it is likely to alleviate or prevent deterioration in the patient's condition.P Fennell 1996 Treatment without consent: law, psychiatry and the treatment of mentally disordered people since 1845. Routledge: 185. In Scotland, under section 234 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003, psychosurgery can only be carried out on consenting patients if a panel from the Mental Welfare Commission confirms that the patient's consent is valid and that the operation is in their best interests. It may also be carried out on incapable patients, as long as they are not objecting, with Court of Session approval. Since the law came into force, no non-consenting patients have undergone psychosurgery. Since the introduction of the Mental Health Act 1983 no more than 28 psychosurgical operations have been carried out in the United Kingdom in any year. No operations were performed in England between 1999 and 2009; Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, performed one anterior cingulotomy in 2010.Care Quality Commission 2010 Monitoring the use of the Mental Health Act in 2009/10 : 93 A few stereotactic anterior capsulotomies are performed every year at the University of Wales Hospital, Cardiff. Stereotactic anterior cingulotomies are performed at the Dundee Royal Infirmary in collaboration with the psychiatric unit at Ninewells Hospital. The Cardiff and Dundee units introduced psychosurgery programmes in the early 1990s and have used psychosurgery in the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. Well-known people who have undergone psychosurgery in the UK *Josef Hassid (1923‚Äì1950), Polish violinist, came to Britain aged 14 with his father in 1938 to give concert performances and recitals in London, and make recordings for HMV. The outbreak of World War II prevented their return to Poland. In 1941 Hassid had a breakdown and was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, where he was given insulin coma therapy and electroconvulsive therapy. He was later detained in Long Grove Hospital, Epsom, and underwent a leucotomy there in 1950. He died 17 days later of a brain infection.A Feinstein 1997 Psychosurgery and the child prodigy. History of Psychiatry 8: 55‚Äì60.M Campbell 1980 The great violinists. Granada Publishing *Ronald Senator, Pulitzer Prize nominated British composer, underwent a leucotomy in St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, in 1950. He described the experience in his book Requiem Letters (Marion Boyers Publishers, 1996). *Lena Zavaroni (1963‚Äì1999), Scottish child star and singer who had suffered from anorexia and depression for many years, underwent a stereotactic anterior capsulotomy at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff in 1999. She died three weeks later from pneumonia (which her doctors considered was not related to the surgery). *The 13th Earl of Galloway was diagnosed as schizophrenic when young and underwent psychosurgery at St Mary's Hospital in London in 1952. His story is told in Louise Carpenter's book An Unlikely Countess: Lily Budge and the 13th Earl of Galloway. (HarperCollins, 2004). Note on terminology Egas Moniz coined two terms to describe his operation: leucotomy (cutting of the white matter of the brain) and psychosurgery (surgery for psychiatric disorder). The American neurologist Walter Freeman and neurosurgeon James Watts adapted Moniz's techniques and coined a new term: lobotomy (cutting of the lobe). In the United Kingdom, psychiatrists used the Freeman-Watts surgical technique but retained the terminology of Moniz ‚Äì leucotomy and psychosurgery. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s the term leucotomy was used as a generic term with writers distinguishing between the standard, pre-frontal, or Freeman-Watts leucotomy on the one hand and modified leucotomies, such as rostral leucotomy, cingulotomy, etc., on the other. In the 1970s the term psychosurgery became more popular as a generic term, with individual operations being named according to the part of the brain in which tissue is destroyed, for example, cingulotomy, capsulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, amygdalotomy, etc. The term leucotomy is still used to refer to the standard prefrontal leucotomies of the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and is occasionally used as a generic term for psychosurgical operations. Some doctors prefer the term neurosurgery for mental disorder (NMD) to psychosurgery. The American term lobotomy has never been used by medical writers in the UK to describe a psychosurgical operation on the frontal lobe. The standard Freeman-Watts operation, called a lobotomy in the US, was called a leucotomy in the UK. Freeman later developed a psychosurgical technique in which an instrument is inserted through the eye- socket. It became known as a transorbital lobotomy in the US and a transorbital leucotomy in the UK (where it was less popular). However the term lobotomy is occasionally used by British journalists synonymously with leucotomy, either to describe the standard operations of former decades or occasionally as a generic term for all psychosurgical operations.

Originally an offshoot of the major engineering company Ransome's it was based at Waterside Works in Ipswich, Suffolk. Ransome's split Ransomes & Rapier was formed in 1869 when four engineers, James Allen Ransome (1806‚Äì1875), his elder son, Robert James Ransome (c.1831‚Äì1891), Richard Christopher Rapier (1836‚Äì1897) and Arthur Alec Bennett (1842‚Äì1916), left the parent firm by agreement to establish a new firm on a site on the River Orwell to continue the business of manufacturing railway equipment and other heavy works.

Ransome's younger son, Allen Ransome (1833‚Äì1913), founded the saw-milling machinery business, A. Ransome & Co, in Chelsea London with a foundry in Battersea. These businesses, transferred to Newark-on-Trent in 1900, led at the outset of World War I to Ransome & Marles now part of Nippon Seik≈ç Kabushiki-kaisha. R. C. Rapier had been head of Ransome's Orwell Works railway department since he joined the business in 1862. When the two businesses were split he became the engineering partner in the new firm known as Ransomes & Rapier at the Waterside Ironworks. A limited liability company was incorporated to own the firm on 17 April 1896 using the same name with the addition of Limited (later plc): Ransomes & Rapier Limited.Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich Branch, Corporate records HC427/1 1873-1972 =The first railway in China= Rapier himself took the leading part in the 1875 negotiation and construction by Ransomes & Rapier of China's first railway, the Woosung Road (or Woosung Railway) from Shanghai to Woosung. The railway opened in 1876 but was dismantled by the local government the following year because it had not received the necessary approvals. The firm also supplied railway turntables in the early to mid-1930s. During the First World War they produced shells, guns and tank turrets. The Stokes mortar was invented by managing director and chairman Sir Wilfred Stokes, knighted for the invention. His nephew Richard Rapier Stokes, MP was also managing director. The company merged with Newton, Chambers & Company of Sheffield and formed the NCK excavator division to form NCK-Rapier who built walking draglines used in opencast mining. Ransomes & Rapier built the model W1400 walking dragline called Sundew for The United Steel Company iron ore quarry at Exton Park, Rutland, England. At the time it was built in 1951, it was the largest in the world, weighing in at 1880 tons.Colossal Earthmovers, by Keith Haddock, Ransomes & Rapier sold the right to their walking dragline technology and patents to Bucyrus International in 1988.

When he left school he went into the family business however after his father died the company failed and was sold off. After being declined entry for army service in World War II due to a damaged heart he was curious with what to do with his life next. Browsing one day through a second hand book shop in Charing Cross Road, he fell upon a bookThe Secrets of Houdini by J.C. Cannell\\". The book was controversial due to its explanation of how the magic of the great escapologist Harry Houdini was performed, and The Magic Circle thought it would promote daring behaviour to try recreate these stunts. However this book inspired The Great Omani into the magic world and after experimental trials with underwater stunts, he was ready for public appearance in 1950. He worked in Bognor Regis performing tricks in a straitjacket chained and padlocked to the legs of the pier as the tide rose. On Brighton's West Pier, The Great Omani was known for jumping though open flames into a bed of glass. In 1977 he marked the Queen's Silver Jubilee by performing a handstand on the cliff edge of Beachy Head, with a Union Jack between his toes. To impress audiences he put himself in great danger during many of his stunts using fire, water and glass at his local pub the Bedford Tavern in Brighton. It was here where he performed his last stunt in 2005. This was the escape out of handcuffs with both arms on fire with lighter fluid. He died in Brighton, East Sussex after a whisky and a cigar at his home on 15 October 2007. His last request was for a trapdoor in the hearse at his funeral. He wrote a short poem, which was read at the occasion: > They lay the Great Omani in his box / They have done it up with nails not > locks / But at his funeral do not despair / Chances are he won't be there.

Health Evidence Network (HEN). Technical Members: German Agency for Quality in Medicine AEZQ is a non-profit organization owned by the German Medical Association and the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians. Activities AEZQ initiated several quality programs for the German healthcare system: It established the German Program for evidence based medical guidelines in the late 90s. Based upon guideline standards from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and referring to experiences from the National Guideline Clearinghouse in the US, the agency founded a German Guideline Clearinghouse aiming at best practice in guideline production. In 1998 AEZQ was co-founder of the German Network for Evidence Based Medicine. The organization established the German Clearinghouse for Patient Information in order to promote scientifically based shared decision making in 1999. In 2002, the agency set up the National Program for Disease Management Guidelines. The development of reliable and consumer information is integral part of this guideline program. AEZQ was co-founder of the Guidelines International Network in 2002 - under the leadership of G√ºnter Ollenschl√§ger, collaborating with other national healthcare quality agencies like the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. In the field of patient safety AEZQ was one of the first German organisations calling for effective patient safety programs. The agency was co-founder of the German Coalition for Patient Safety. AEZQ established a national network of Critical Incident Reporting Systems. The institution is partner of the international High 5 Project. In 2010 the agency set up a Digital Library for physicians and other interested health professionals and lays - the German Medical eLibrary (www.arztbibliothek.de) - for reinforcement of reliable and unbiased knowledge management in healthcare. AEZQ entertained the administrative offices of the Guidelines International Network, and of the German Network for Evidence Based Medicine until 2013.

Gunn. It was published in 1955 by Gnome Press in an edition of 5,000 copies. However, 900 copies were never bound. It was also issued in paperback by Ace (D-169, 1955, 35¬¢, and F-241, 40¬¢) and reissued by Berkley Books in 1977 and by Ballantine Books in 1982 (with minor typographic errors). Williamson initially wrote about 50 pages in manuscript for the first draft, and worked up about 150 pages of notes for the novel's completion. Finding himself \\"blocked\\" on the project, he turned his materials over to Gunn, who completed the book. It was sold to Gnome for a $500 advance.James Gunn, \\"I Remember Jack,\\" Locus, January 2007, p.43 It is an adventure story in the classic Williamson tradition, woven with a reflection about the relative importance of impersonal forces and individuals in the events of history. Plot summary The scattered planets are held together by the Eron Company, holder‚Äîat least apparently‚Äîof the secret of faster-than-light travel through the Tubes, which are powered through energy drawn from the star Canopus. The leaders of Eron are gathered on ancient Earth to dedicate a new Tube, near the ruins of what had been Denver, Colorado. Though aging General Manager Garth Kohlnar is nearing death from natural causes, the adventurer Horn has been hired by parties unknown to assassinate him. Making his way through the desert, past a gauntlet of guards and security forces, Horn encounters Wu, an aging Chinese vendor, and his curious shape-changing companion Lil, neither of whom seem capable of surviving the dangers and harsh conditions of the desert. Yet they are every bit his equal in reaching the celebration, descending from hiding to mingle with the wealthy, entertaining the idle while Lil steals and consumes their diamonds. Horn completes his mission, and in the desperate struggle to escape the ensuing manhunt, he encounters Wendre Kohlnar, the beautiful daughter and now possibly the heir-apparent of the dead man. Escaping through a transdimensional Tube in a space suit, Horn finds himself on the planet Eron, a world consumed by the Eron Company. Here he encounters a corrupt and effeminate aristocracy, a brewing power struggle over the succession, a covert revolution, a secret subway known only to the Directors‚Äîand Wu and Lil, at every turn displaying more mysterious knowledge and capability. The mystery of who actually knows the secret of the Tubes becomes increasingly important in the quest to become General Manager. Horn attends a meeting of the Directors in disguise, with Wu playing the role of Director Matal (the real one having been murdered by an agent of the ambitious Duchane, Director of Security). Horn and Wu rescue Wendre and escape while the other Directors are locked in a presumably fatal struggle. They make their way to the North Polar Cap and attempt to turn off the Tubes, finding that mere possession of pure Golden Blood is not, in fact, the secret of deactivating them. Troops and revolutionaries clash incoherently at the polar cap, and Horn is eventually captured and sent to the prison planet of Vantee. Forging an alliance with the outlaws there, he takes advantage of the political conflict in the home world to capture the prison, apparently rescuing in the process Peter Sair, the Liberator, the leader of the failed revolt against Eron wherein Horn learned his skills. Returning with Sair to the chaos of Eron, Horn is able to capture the critical polar cap Tube station and thus take control of the planet, which he hands over to Wendre, and she in turn to Sair. As Horn and Wendre Kohlnar interview the imprisoned Duchane, Horn is tricked into shooting the prisoner just before he can reveal a key secret: the nature of Wu. Wu, in turn, falls victim to the temptation to explain his curious place in history to Horn, his intended victim, but Horn is rescued by Wendre and Wu is apparently (finally) shot dead. Wendre and Horn plan to marry and move to the rural Cluster, far from her Eronian home. Is Wu the puppet master controlling all, or merely an immortal opportunist? Is freedom an illusion or a necessity, or both? The answers are recorded in a manuscript in Chinese that no one but Wu can read.

It was found by Jean-Phillipe Boubli of the University of Auckland after following native Yanomamo Indians on their hunts along the Rio Arac√°, a northern tributary of the Rio Negro. It was subsequently described in 2008 together with the more westerly distributed Neblina uakari. Until then, the black- headed uakari was the only species of mainly black uakari that was recognized. Stephen F. Ferrari et al proposed treating the Arac√° uakari as a subspecies of the black-headed uakari rather than as a separate species. This monkey is named after Brazilian biologist Jos√© M√°rcio Ayres, formerly a senior zoologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society. Jos√© M√°rcio Ayres, who died in 2003, pioneered studies in uakaris and played a fundamental role in the creation of the Mamirau√° Sustainable Development Reserve, which is of great importance for the white uakari. Very little is known about the Arac√° uakari, but based on present knowledge it has the smallest distribution of all species of uakaris (possibly as small as ) and is the only one not found in any protected area. Although few people live within its very remote distribution, it is hunted; at least seasonally.

Biography √òystein Sev√•g is a Norwegian composer, pianist and music producer. He was born in B√¶rum in 1957, beginning piano lessons at age five. As a teen he played bass in a rock band but returned to his classical roots in time to study piano, flute and composition at a private Music Conservatory in Oslo; by the 1980s, however, Sev√•g had become fascinated by the possibilities offered by the development of the synthesizer, and he plunged into electronic music with his self-released 1989 debut LP Close Your Eyes and See. The product of five years in the studio, the album slowly crept into Billboard's New Age charts in the USA, and it landed Sev√•g on the Windham Hill label to issue the follow-up, 1993's Link. He returned two years later with Global House, a record reflecting a newfound interest in acoustic sounds and worldbeat textures, including didgeridoo and string quartet; the ambient album Visual, a collaboration with guitarist Lakki Patey, followed in 1996. Signing to Hearts of Space Records, Sev√•g resurfaced in 1997 with the acclaimed Bridge, with the London Philharmonia Orchestra, winning the Indie Award in USA for the best new age recording of the year. From 1999 to 2005, he lived in Freiburg, South Germany, where among other things he worked on music therapy together with Maria Sevag and the psychologist Katharina Martin. In April 2005, Sev√•g's new album Caravan was released, 8 years after his previous album Bridge. The new material was introduced on a concert in Oslo in March. In June one of his new compositions in the classical area - a string trio - had its first performance on Casa dei Mezzo Music Festival on Crete, Greece, and in April 2006 in Madrid. In October 2005 he had two concerts in Norway with his \\"Global House Band\\" - followed up by ten small solo concerts at the Vigeland Mausoleum in Oslo. In the spring 2006 √òystein Sev√•g moved to Oslo. He produced singer/songwriter Eliksir's debut album Earthly Things, released in 2007. His latest album Based on a True Story was released in 2007. In February 2006 he met the singer/songwriter Benedicte Torget, and worked with her as a co producer, arranger and piano player on her debut album After a Day of Rain, released in August 2008. In April 2010 he released his studio album The Red Album collaborating with Peter Wettre, Bendik Hofseth, Andreas Bye, Paolo Vinaccia, Ole Marius Melhuus, Zotora Nygard, Sara √ñvinge, Audun Erlien and Eivind Aarset.

IL-17R family consists of 5 members: IL-17RA, IL-17RB, IL-17RC, IL-17RD and IL-17RE. Functional IL-17R is a transmembrane receptor complex usually consisting of one IL-17RA, which is a founding member of the family, and second other family subunit, thus forming heteromeric receptor binding different ligands. IL-17A, a founding member of IL-17 ligand family binds to heteromeric IL-17RA/RC receptor complex. IL-17RB binds preferentially IL-17B and IL-17E and heteromeric IL-17RA/RE complex binds IL-17C. However, there is still unknown ligand for IL-17RD. The first identified member IL-17RA is located on human chromosome 22, whereas other subunits IL-17RB to IL-17RD are encoded within human chromosome 3. Evolution IL17RD is probably the most ancient member of IL-17 receptor family. It was firstly identified in zebrafish and its homologues were also found in sea lamprey and C. elegans. There are two IL-17Rs (IL-17RA and IL-17RD) in the genome of the basal chordate Amphioxus. After two rounds of whole genome duplications, these two IL-17R genes expanded into five early vertebrate IL-17R genes, IL-17RA to IL-17RE. Two (IL-17RA and IL-17RD) are found in most vertebrates, whereas the other three (IL-17RB, IL-17RC and IL-17RE) have undergone some losses in vertebrates during evolution.  Structure  Structure of IL-17 receptors is unique in comparison with all other known receptor families. IL-17RA is by far the largest member of the family and has the longest cytoplasmic tail of the family. This cytoplasmic tail provides docking sites for numerous signaling intermediates. However, conformational changes mediated after ligand binding are essential for association of these signaling molecules as well as the second receptor subunit and enable subsequent signal transduction. IL-17RA/RC receptor complex is composed of both alpha helices and beta sheets and its extracellular part contains two fibronectin domains, which are involved in formation of two ligand binding sites. Intracellular part of IL-17 receptors consists of several structural domains including SEFIR motif, a highly conserved motif within IL-17R family. Although SEFIR motif also serves as signaling molecule in IL-1R or Toll-like receptor families, its signaling features and associated adaptor molecules are quite different in IL-17 receptor family. In case of IL-17RA, it has longer cytoplasmic tail which contains some additional structural domains, such as TILL domain (\\"TIR-like loop\\") or inhibitory CBAD domain (\\"C/EBPŒ≤-activation domain\\").  Expression and regulation  IL-17RA has been observed at high levels in various tissues such as haematopoietic, bone marrow, thymus, and spleen tissue. IL-17RA is also normally found at low levels in colon, small intestine, and lung tissues. IL-17RA is expressed in CD8+ T cells, and upregulated by IL-15 and IL-21. IL-17RA may be internalised after binding IL-17A. IL-17RB is highly expressed in the kidney, liver and Th2 cells and its overexpression promotes triggering of Th2 immune response. IL-17RC expression is low in haematopoietic tissues and high in non-immune cells of the prostate, liver, kidney, thyroid and joints. Another family subunit IL-17RE is highly expressed in Th17 cells.  Function  Signaling via IL-17R protects our body against several bacterial and fungal infections caused by invading pathogens, especially against Candida albicans. Binding of proinflammatory cytokin IL-17A to IL-17 receptor causes important conformational changes that enable binding of signaling adaptors, such as Act1 or TRAF proteins. Binding of these signaling adaptors triggers activation of several signaling pathways, including NF-Œ∫B, pathways of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) or C/EBPs pathway. Activation of these pathways results in expression and production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFŒ± or IL-1Œ≤, chemokines, which drive infiltration of macrophages and antimicrobial products, for example defensins and mucins. All these products contribute to the development of inflammation and elimination of various foreign pathogens. Patients with impaired IL-17R signaling suffer from yeast infections, such as CMC (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis), or respiratory infections. Apart from production of these inflammatory products de novo, signaling via IL-17R also promotes stabilization of already existent specific mRNA transcripts. This stabilization prolongs the half-life of mRNAs and prevents their quick degradation. Again, these mRNA transcripts predominantly encode proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines. = Pathology = Although IL-17R provides crucial protection against a variety of microbial infections in humans, it must be very strictly regulated. Immoderate and undue activation of IL-17R by IL-17A results in development of several autoimmune diseases, specifically psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis.  Clinical significance  These days, several monoclonal antibodies neutralizing IL-17A have potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases in humans, such as plaque psoriasis. Majority of these monoclonal antibodies are humanized IgG1. This therapy may also be soon used for protection against periodontal bone loss as it is currently being tested in mice. IL-17RA has been observed at high levels in people undergoing treatment for cardiac fibroblasts and in certain tissues such as: haematopoietic, bone marrow, thymus, and spleen tissue. =As therapy targets= Approved anti-IL-17(R) drugs include: Brodalumab (Siliq), an antibody targeting IL-17 receptor is approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Ixekizumab and secukinumab approved for plaque psoriasis are antibodies which target IL-17A itself rather than the receptor.

He also played 15 games in the World Hockey Association (WHA) with the Indianapolis Racers. Sacharuk was drafted by the New York Rangers in second round, 21st overall in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft. Junior hockey Sacharuk began his career in 1967 as a 14-year-old with his hometown team, the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Canadian Hockey League (WCHL). It was rare for someone as young as Sacharuk to be playing at that level, and he was playing with older, more experienced players aged 17 to 20, many who were positioned to be drafted to the NHL. Sacharuk was already pushing 6 feet tall and 180 pounds as a defensive stalwart. At the Blades' training camp at that time, coach George \\"Bus\\" Agar noted Sacharuk's blistering slap-shot, an asset for a defenceman. He made the Blades roster for the 1967-68 campaign and scored six goals in only 34 games. The following season, Sacharuk played 56 games with the Blades, recording 16 points with five goals. In the 1969-70 season the lowly Niagara Falls Flyers of the Ontario Hockey Association offered him a spot, promising more ice time and a chance to improve his game. In 51 games with the Flyers, Sacharuk improved by scoring 19 goals and 18 assists, a personal best up to that time. The following season, Sacharuk returned home to the Blades, and he was one of the team's scoring leaders for the following two seasons, with 77 goals in 124 games, and 171 points. In the 1971-72 season he scored 50 goals, finishing his junior career as the Blades' leading scorer, and also the tenth- leading goal scorer in the WCHL, tied with Lanny McDonald. The 50 goals set a single-season record WHL record which still stands as of 2020. Playing career Sakaruk was drafted in the second round of the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft at #21 overall by the New York Rangers. At the time, the Rangers had established NHL defencemen such as Brad Park, Rod Seiling, Jim Neilson and Dale Rolfe, making it difficult to crack the Rangers roster. Ultimately, he was sent to the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Providence Reds, at the start of the 1972‚Äì73 NHL season. After 64 games with the Reds he was recalled to the Rangers, and recorded one point, a goal, in eight games. The following season, he was again sent to the Reds following an unsuccessful Rangers' training camp. After 42 games for the Reds, Rangers again recalled him, and he played the remaining 23 games of the 1973‚Äì74 NHL season, but in limited playing time his offensive production suffered and he only managed six points in 23 games, scoring twice. Finding him expendable and in need of scoring, on August 29, 1974 the Rangers traded Sacharuk along with a number #1 draft pick to the St. Louis Blues for winger Greg Polis. With the Blues during the 1974‚Äì75 NHL season, Sacharuk proved himself as an offensive- minded defenceman and scored 20 goals and 22 assists over the course of 76 games. He ended the season as the fifth-highest goal scored on the team, and the 20 goals set a Blues single-season record for defencemen, which he held until tied by Jeff Brown in 1992; Brown surpassed the record the following season. Sacharuk scored 14 of his goals on the road, which remains a single- season team record for defencemen. However the Blues also had several top NHL defensemen including the Bob and Barclay Plager, Bob Hess and Bob Gassoff, and traded Sacharuk back to the Rangers in the summer of 1975, in return for winger Bob MacMillan. Back in New York for the 1975‚Äì76 NHL season, Sacharuk's point production declined and he managed only 13 points in 42 games, missing almost half the season due to injury. The following season, he started with the Rangers' new AHL affiliate, the New Haven Nighthawks and put up some respectable numbers in the minors with 54 points including 23 goals in 55 regular season games. The Rangers called him up for only two games in the 1976‚Äì77 NHL season and he registered no points. Sacharuk did not make the Rangers' squad in 1977-78 and was spent the entire season with New Haven. He returned to his offensive game and registered a solid 56 points, including 19 goals. During the summer of 1978, his contract was not renewed by the Rangers, and he took an offer from the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA). Sacharuk played 15 games with the Racers, who folded in December, recording 11 points. While other teammates on the Racers managed to find new homes to finish the season, Sacharuk was unable to do so and sat out the rest of the year. The following year, Sacharuk signed with the Birmingham Bulls in the Central Hockey League, where he played 80 games, notching 40 points. In the 1980 season, he signed on to play with EC Innsbruck of the Austrian Hockey League where he played 34 games and managed 35 goals as a player who was over-skilled in a league which did not have many players with NHL experience. The following season in 1981-82 he played with Stadlau, another Austrian club, after which he retired from hockey. In 1988 the Birmingham Eagles of the British Hockey League enticed him to play for them, but he again retired after two games. Sacharuk was noted for one of the hardest shots in hockey. Post-playing career Following his playing career, Sacharuk has filled a variety of roles in hockey. He has coached HC TWK Innsbruck and Graz 99ers in Austria, HK Vojvodina and Serbia men's national ice hockey team in Serbia. In 2008 he became the head coach of the Serie A team Sport Ghiaccio Pontebba in Italy. In 2013 he became the marketing manager for the Merritt Centennials of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL). In 2017 Sacharuk joined the Southern Oregon Spartans of the United States Premier Hockey League as an assistant coach.

In Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, in the Indian state of West Bengal, almost 80 per cent of the pavements are encroached by hawkers and illegal settlers. In many countries, hawkers use pavements or other public places to retail their goods or services but in Kolkata the magnitude has drawn special attention of administrators and law courts. Background The population of Kolkata urban agglomeration grew from 1,510,000 in 1901 to 4,670,000 in 1951 to 9,194,000 in 1981.Chakraborty, Satyesh C., The Growth of Calcutta in the Twentieth Century, in Calcutta:The Living City, Vol II, Edited by Chaudhuri, Sukanta, 1990/2005, Page 7, Table 2, Kolkata did not draw in people from rural areas by offering a better quality of life. As in any other Indian city, the immigrants found poverty in Kolkata as severe and dehumanising as in the villages, but was offered a relatively quick opportunity of new income through placement in the urban economy. With the partition of India in 1947, the metropolitan cities of Kolkata and Delhi were flooded by displaced persons or refugees from Pakistan. The Union government at Delhi, with better resources at its command, handled the task of rehabilitation faster and more comprehensively, than the state government in Kolkata could accomplish. Left largely to themselves the refugees in Kolkata gradually secured their placements in the urban economy. The 1951 census found that only 33.2 percent of Kolkata's inhabitants were city-born, the rest were immigrants: 12.3 percent were from elsewhere in West Bengal, 26.6 percent from other Indian states, and 26.9 percent from East Pakistan. In 1981, the Government of West Bengal estimated the total number of persons displaced from East Bengal to the state to be around 8 million or one sixth of the total population of the state.Nilanjana Chatterjee, The East Bengal Refugees, A lesson in Survival, in Calcutta:The Living City, Vol II, p. 70. Several million refugees settled in the outskirts of Kolkata.Datta, Bhabatosh, The Economy of Calcutta, Today and Tomorrow, in Calcutta:The Living City, Vol II, pp. 96-104. The percentage of migrants in Kolkata's population has been declining since the 1950s, though around a third of the population still consists of fresh migrants. Kolkata is gradually attaining a state of saturation.Ghosh, Ambikaprasad, The Demography of Calcutta, in Calcutta:The Living City, Vol II, p. 51, 57. It has also been affected by economic decline resulting from industrial sickness. In 2005, West Bengal headed the list of states with sick units. The overall economic scenario is highlighted by the growing number of pavement dwellers. Kolkata had 48,802 pavement dwellers in 1971 and 55,571 in 1985, according to Census and/or KMDA figures. Around two- thirds are from West Bengal and the rest from outside the state. While the economy of Kolkata has been sliding backwards in many respects, there has been remarkable expansion in certain areas ‚Äì real estate, information technology and retail trade. Big shopping centres have come up, and along with it there has been a large increase in small shops and pavement stalls. =Political Actions= With hawkers occupying large portions of the pavements, in the sixties the state government, then controlled by the Congress Party, launched Operation Hawker and tried to remove hawkers from the streets of Kolkata. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), then in the opposition, organised the hawkers in active protest. Soon thereafter, the Congress Party was out of power in the state. Later, when the CPI(M) was firmly in saddle as leader of the Left Front for around two decades, it launched Operation Sunshine in 1996. Officers of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, cadres of the CPI(M) along with police battalions demolished the side walk stalls of thousands of hawkers. Such stalls had lined the city's thoroughfares for nearly three decades. This time the hawkers were mobilised by opposition leaders such as Mamata Banerjee but the Left Front remained firm in its conviction to remove hawkers. However, in the face of protests, the municipal administration and the police allowed the hawkers to reoccupy gradually the pavements of streets from which they had been cleared. The Calcutta Hawker Sangram Committee, a union of more than 32 local hawkers' associations formed in the beforemath of Operation Sunshine, took the leadership to reclaim the footpaths. The situation has come to such a pass that according to a deputy commissioner of Kolkata Police, 80 per cent of Kolkata's pavements are encroached by hawkers and illegal settlers. Pedestrians are forced to use the roads because there is hardly any space on the pavements for walking, and once people are getting used to walking on the streets, they continue to do so even if the side walks are vacant. Some reports suggest that the hawkers have made a comeback on the streets of Kolkata during the period 2000-2005 when Trinamool Congress was in power in Kolkata Corporation. Dr. Ritajyoti Bandyopadhyay has recently argued that the Hawker Sangram Committee has subsequently come to occupy a central position in the governance of the realm of footpath-hawking through the creation and maintenance of an archival database that articulates the entrepreneurial capacity of the 'poor hawker' and his ability to deliver goods and services at low-cost. The significance of the Hawker Sangram Committee's archive is that, it enables the organisation to form a critique of the exclusionary discourses on the hawker, mostly propagated by a powerful combination of a few citizens' associations, the judiciary and the press. Bandyopadhyay also documents how the successful mobilisation of a population group like the hawkers is marked by the virtual destruction of a pre-existing archive on the other group of 'encroachers' of the footpath space, the pavement dwellers. Legal action With the politicians dilly-dallying, the matter rolled on to the courts as public interest litigation. In 1996, Kolkata High Court asked the state government to submit a detailed report on pavement encroachment. In 1998, another case demanding rehabilitation of hawkers was moved in the court. In 2003, the high court asked the state government to state its stand on hawkers. In 2005, the state government informed the high court that a uniform policy on rehabilitation of hawkers was underway. In 2007, the high court found that its 1996 order was not implemented. Commenting on a petition filed by environmentalist Subhas Dutta in 2004, the division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Soumitra Sen observed in 2006, that the hawker menace was growing like cancer. It was impossible for people to walk on the roads, forget about footpaths. The advocate general informed the high court that the state government had drawn out a plan regarding the hawkers. The highlights of the plan were earmarking of hawker free zone, creating some hawking zones, setting time limits for hawking, banning erection of permanent structures, keeping two-thirds of pavement free of hawkers, replacing polythene sheets with colourful umbrellas, removing of hawkers from of crossings, and issuing licences to existing hawkers only. Municipal Corporation KMC had conducted Operation Sunshine in 1996 to remove hawkers from Gariahat and Shyambazar. Following the hawker removal drive, the KMC commissioner, Asim Barman, had issued a notification imposing certain restrictions on the movement of hawkers on 21 streets in the city. Bikash Bhattacharya, Mayor of Kolkata, has said that hawkers would be allowed to stay on all pavements across the city and they would be allowed to occupy a third of the pavements along the streets but they would not be allowed to occupy space within a 50-metre radius of road crossings or build any structures. According to the Hawker Sangram Committee, \\"Hawkers are exploited by the agents of trade union leaders, politicians, police, civic councillors. They have to pay to earn their bread.\\" The hawkers pay 2.66 billion as bribe. This is around 3 per cent of the business. The Committee says, \\"We are willing to pay rent or some other form of tax to the civic body if we get the right to conduct business. Identity cards will protect us from extortion by multiple agencies,\\" There are several unions or associations of hawkers, such as Calcutta Hawkers' Men Union and Bengal Hawkers Association.

The biodegradation processes that occurs is provided by the bacteria themselves. In order for this to work, sufficient oxygen as well as water and nutrients (for cell growth) is to be supplied. Method Contaminated air enters the system at the bottom of the filter and passes in an upward direction through the filter. Water is supplied through the surface of the biofilter and trickles down over the lava rock to the bottom, where it is collected. Constant water provisioning at the surface prevents dry-out of the active bacteria in the biofilm and ensures a constant pH value in the filter. It also functions to make nutrients available to the bacteria. A pile of lavastones in a lavafilter Percolating water collected at the filter bottom contains odour components as well as sulfuric acid from the biological oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. Depending on the process design the collected water is recirculated or subjected to further treatment. Types of systems At present: 2 types of systems are used; # constantly submerged lava filters (for treatment ponds, combined treatment ponds/irrigation reservoirs, ...) # not-submerged lava filters (for wastewater treatment; wastewater is simply sprayed on the pebbles with this system)Pictures and small overview of non- constant submerged lavafilters (in Dutch) =Constantly submerged lavafilters= These are constructed out of 2 layers of lava pebbles and a top layer of nutrient-free soil (only at the plants roots).Example picture of constant-submerged lavastone filter On top, water-purifying plants (as Iris pseudacorus and Sparganium erectum) are placed. Usually, around 1/4 of the dimension of lavastone is required to purify the water and just like slow sand filters, a series of herringbone drains are placed (with lava filters these are placed at the bottom layer). The water-purifying plants used with constantly submerged, planted, lavafilters (e.g. treatment ponds, self- purifying irrigation reservoirs, ...) include a wide variety of plants, depending on the local climate and geographical location. Plants are usually chosen which are indigenous in that location for environmental reasons and optimum workings of the system. In addition to water-purifying (de-nutrifying) plants, plants that supply oxygen, and shade are also added in ecologic water catchments, ponds, ... This to allow a complete ecosystem to form. Finally, in addition to plants, locally grown bacteria and non-predatory fish are also added to eliminate pests. The bacteria are usually grown locally by submerging straw in water and allowing it to form bacteria (arriving from the surrounding atmosphere). The plants used (placed on an area 1/4 of the water mass) are divided in 4 separate water depth-zones; knowingly: # A water-depth zone from 0‚Äì20 cm; Iris pseudacorus, Sparganium erectum, ... may be placed here (temperate climates) # A water-depth zone from 40‚Äì60 cm; Stratiotes aloides, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae, ... may be placed here (temperate climates) # A water-depth zone from 60‚Äì120 cm; Nymphea alba, ... may be placed here (temperate climates) # A submerged water-depth zone; Myriophyllum spicatum, ... may be placed here (temperate climates) Finally, three types of (non- predatory) fish (surface; bottom and ground-swimmers) are chosen. This of course to ensure that the fish may 'get along'. Examples of the three types of fish (for temperate climates) are: * Surface swimming fish: Leuciscus leuciscus, Leuciscus idus, Scardinius erythrophthalmus * Middle-swimmers: Rutilus rutilus * Bottom-swimming fish: Tinca tinca See also *Constructed wetland *Treatment pond *Organisms used in water purification References Water filters Appropriate technology Environmental soil science DIY culture ","title":"Lava filter"},{"id":"16036982","text":"Labbeville is a commune in the Val-d'Oise department in √éle-de-France in northern France.

Early life Colebrooke was the third son of James Colebrooke, a London banker, and was educated at Leiden University. Career Arno's Grove house in 1816. Gatton House in Gatton Park He acquired Arnos Grove house in 1752 on the death of his father.Mason, Tom. (1947) The Story of Southgate. Enfield: Meyers Brooks. p. 61. After the death of his father and an older brother, George was left in sole charge of the family bank in Threadneedle Street, and invested some of his wealth in buying up control of the borough of Arundel in Sussex, where the family lived. Arundel was not a classic pocket borough, where the power to return MPs was literally tied to property rights that could be freely bought and sold, but a thoroughly corrupt one where bribery was routine and where maintaining influence of the elections required constant expenditure. Nevertheless, Colebrooke kept control for twenty years, sitting himself as its MP from 1754 to 1774 and for most of the period being able to choose also who held the other seat. Meanwhile, his brother, James had bought control of one seat in another rotten borough, Gatton in Surrey, for ¬£23,000, and was also sitting in Parliament. Both brothers were at first Opposition Whigs, but switched support to the Duke of Newcastle's government and were rewarded in 1759 with the creation of a baronetcy for James (who had daughters but no son) and a special remainder of the baronetcy to George. When James died in 1761, George inherited both the baronetcy, Gatton Park and the Lordship of the Manor at Gatton with its guaranteed control of one of the parliamentary seats there. He had Gatton Park landscaped by Capability Brown between 1762 and 1768 More valuably, however, Colebrooke's support for Newcastle ensured his eligibility for lucrative government contracts. By 1762, he held two of these contracts, one for remitting money to the British forces in the American colonies and the other for victualling the troops there. But with Newcastle's fall from power in that year, Colebrooke was immediately ejected from one contract by the new government, and the other was not renewed when it expired in 1765. Though offered compensation or new contracts on the formation of the Rockingham government, he preferred instead to accept a well- paid post as chirographer to the Court of Common Pleas. From this point onwards although he retained his seat in Parliament he was rarely active there. Colebrooke's business interests were diverse. He speculated in land, buying large estates in Lanarkshire, and purchased plantations in Antigua (where his wife already had interests), Grenada and Dominica; he was also a member of a syndicate to settle the Ohio Valley in 1768, and had interests in New England. (Colebrook, New Hampshire is named in his honour.) Two interests in particular, however, led to his eventual downfall: his involvement in the East India Company and his speculations in raw materials. Colebrooke was a Director of the East India Company from 1767‚Äì1771, Deputy Chairman 1768-69 and was elected Chairman three times, in 1769, 1770 and 1772. His final year in office was a disastrous one: the company got into financial difficulties (which led to the passing of the Regulating Act of 1773), he was accused of speculating in its stock while Chairman, and was left heavily in debt to a number of the other leading figures in the company, partly through arrangements to procure votes in the Company's elections. He lost much larger sums, however, speculating on prices of raw materials - hemp, flax, lead, logwood and alum among others. In 1771 he lost ¬£190,000 dealing in hemp; from 1772 he was attempting to corner the world's supply of alum, buying up mines in Yorkshire and Lancashire, and saw much of the remainder of his fortune swallowed up when the market collapsed as part of a wider financial crisis. At first, Colebrooke was able to stay in business with assistance from the Bank of England, but his bank temporarily stopped payment on 31 March 1773, and permanently (after three years in the control of trustees appointed by his creditors) on 7 August 1776. Yet at the same period he was spending considerable sums on the rebuilding of his London house in Soho Square. Most of his property, including his share in the rotten borough at Gatton, was sold to meet his liabilities, and a commission of bankruptcy was taken out against him in 1777. Later life He retired to Boulogne-sur-Mer, so poor that the East India Company had to vote him a pension, but later returned to England and managed eventually to pay his creditors in full so that some inheritance was left for his descendants. He died on 5 August 1809. Marriage He had married Mary Gayner, daughter of Peter Gayner of Antigua, in 1754, and they had three sons and three daughters: * Mary Colebrooke (born 1757) * George Colebrooke (1759‚Äì1809) * James Edward Colebrooke (1761‚Äì1838), who succeeded to the baronetcy * Harriet Colebrooke (1762‚Äì1785) * Louisa Colebrooke (born 1764) * Professor Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1765‚Äì1837) References and sources ;References ;Sources * Edward Kimber and Richard Johnson, The Baronetage of England (London, 1771) * Lewis Namier, The Structure of Politics at the Accession of George III (2nd edition - London: St Martin's Press, 1961) * Lewis Namier & John Brooke, The History of Parliament: The House of Commons 1754-1790 (London: HMSO, 1964)  Survey of London: volumes 33 and 34: St Anne Soho (1966), online at www.british-history.ac.uk * |- 1729 births 1809 deaths Leiden University alumni Baronets in the Baronetage of Great Britain Directors of the British East India Company Whig (British political party) MPs Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies British slave owners British MPs 1754‚Äì1761 British MPs 1761‚Äì1768 British MPs 1768‚Äì1774 George Arnos Grove ","title":"George Colebrooke"},{"id":"16037018","text":"Vernaison is a commune in the Metropolis of Lyon in Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in eastern France.

The prime-minister was Yaroslav Stetsko, and the head of Council of Seniors was Kost Levitsky. The OUN intended to take advantage of the retreat of Soviet forces from Ukraine. Some members thought that they had found a new powerful ally in Nazi Germany to aid them in their struggle against the Soviet Union. Days after the Nazi invasion of Lviv, however, the leadership of the newly formed government was arrested and sent to concentration camps in Germany. Within two years of the declaration, the Nazis had imprisoned or killed 80% of OUN-B leadership.Timothy Snyder. The Causes of Ukrainian-Polish Ethnic Cleansing 1943. Past & Present, No. 179 (May, 2003), pp. 207 Background =Ukrainian Territory Between World Wars= After World War I, Ukraine was divided into three parts: most of Central and Eastern Ukraine became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1921. The capital was Kharkiv. The majority of current Western Ukraine became part of the Second Polish Republic. This included the city of Lviv, which at the time was the center of Ukrainian nationalist activity. A small part of current far Western Ukraine, the Zakarpattia, became part of Czechoslovakia. Northern Bukovina belonged to Romania. =The Ukrainian Nationalist Movement in Western Ukraine= For various reasons, the Ukrainian nationalist movement was more active in Western Ukraine than in Central Ukraine in the inter-war period. At the end of World War I, veterans of the Sich Riflemen created the Ukrainian Military Organization in 1920 to promote the creation of an independent Ukrainian state. The leader was Yevhen Konovalets. =The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists - the OUN= In 1929, the Ukrainian Military Organization became the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The first leader was Bohdan Kravciv. The stated goal of the OUN was the creation of an independent Ukrainian State. In 1940, the OUN suffered a split into two groups - one group supported Andriy Melnyk (this group became known as the OUN-M, or \\"Melnykivtsi\\"), while the other group supported Stepan Bandera (this group became known as the OUN-B, or Banderivtsi). The OUN-B was considered the more radical of the two. Prelude to the Declaration The OUN realized that an opportunity was available to fulfill their mandate - the creation of a Ukrainian State. On June 22, 1941, the Ukrainian National Committee (Ukrayinsky Natsionalny' Komitet; UNK) was created in Krak√≥w, with Volodymyr Horbovy as a president. The UNK published an essay, \\"Memorial\\", which outlined the plans of the OUN to declare independence. This essay was met with severe disapproval of the Nazi authorities, and the leaders of the UNK, Horbovy and Bandera, were told to rescind the document. They refused, and made their way to Lviv. On June 26, 1941, Soviet forces fled from Lviv, and the Ukrainian Nachtigall Battalion entered the city. The leader of the battalion was Roman Shukhevych. Preamble In his memoirs Vasyl Kuk said: Text State seal of the Government of the Ukrainian state 1941. Government After the proclamation of the Ukrainian independence a government was announced. This government included politicians from various parties, as well as political ideologies.

Published by Ukrainian Central Information Service, London 1987. . Reactions to the proclamation =Reaction in Ukraine= The act of proclamation was broadcast by Yaroslav Stetsko over the radio in Lviv, which made many believe it was supported by the advancing German troops. The act received immediate support from several Ukrainian church officials such as Metropolitan Archbishop Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Bishop Polikarp Sikorsky of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and Bishop Hryhoriy Khomyshyn Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Apparently convinced that the group of Stetsko had the backing of the Germans Metropolitan wrote a pastoral letter in which he exhorted the people to support the newly proclaimed government \\"the scarifies which the final attainment of our goals require demand above all dutiful obedience to the just orders of the government which do not conflict with God‚Äôs law.\\" Moreover, he declared: :We greet the victorious German Army as deliver from enemy. We render our obedient homage to the government which has been erected. We recognize Mr.Yaroslav Stetsko as Head of State Administration of Ukraine. The pastoral letter was read over the radio by chaplain of Nachtigall Battalion Father Hryn‚Äôokh the same morning. It appeared to have removed any doubts which may have been lingering in the mind of most prominent Ukrainians in Lviv concerning the origin of the Stets‚Äôko government.John Armstrong, Ukrainian Nationalism, 2nd edition: New York: Columbia University Press, 1963) pp.80-81 Supporters of Ukrainian independence have been divided in their assessment of the proclamation. Some considered it brilliant, others considered it reckless or even foolish.Michael Savaryn. Proclamation of Ukrainian statehood, 1941. Encyclopedia of Ukraine. =Reaction by the German Government= The Declaration of Independence took the German authorities completely by surprise, and they saw it as an attempted coup.OUN-German Relations 1941-1945, Taras Hunczak. (1994). From German-Ukrainian relations in historical perspective. Hans-Joachim Torke, John-Paul Himka, eds. Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press, University of Alberta. pg. 178 When Nazi troops entered Lviv, the German authorities told the leadership of the Ukrainian government to disband. However, it did not, and in reprisal the leaders of the government were arrested and interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. These included President Yaroslav Stetsko, and Stepan Bandera. =Post-war reaction to the Declaration= Some Ukrainian groups downplayed the early cooperation between the Ukrainian nationalist parties and the Nazis.

He is best known for his consummate actions whilst commanding the tenth brigade during the Battle of Waterloo, which kept open the vital line of communication between Hougoumont farmhouse and the rest of the Allied army. Life Lambert entered the British Army on 27 January 1791, as an ensign in the 1st Foot Guards. He was promoted to lieutenant and captain on 9 October 1793. He served at the sieges of Valenciennes and Dunkirk, and was in the Battle of Lincelles in 1793. He was adjutant of the third battalion in the campaign of 1794, served with it during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and in the expedition to Holland in 1799. He was promoted captain and lieutenant-colonel on 14 May 1801. He served in Portugal and Spain in 1808, and was present at Corunna, and he commanded the light companies of the guards in the Walcheren expedition of 1809. He became colonel in the army on 25 July 1810, and embarked for Cadiz in command of the third battalion on 30 May 1811. In January 1812, he was sent to Carthagena with two battalions. He remained there three months, and in October he joined Wellington's army at Salamanca. On 4 June 1813 he was promoted major-general, and was appointed to a brigade of the sixth division. He commanded at the battles of Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez, and Toulouse, and was Mentioned in Despatches. He was awarded the Army Gold Cross and was made KCB on 2 January 1815. Having been sent to America, he joined the army under Sir Edward Pakenham, at the Battle of New Orleans, on 6 January 1815, with the 7th and 43rd regiments. In the unsuccessful attack on the American entrenchments, made two days afterwards, he commanded the reserve. Pakenham being killed, and General Gibbs mortally wounded, the chief command devolved on Lambert. He decided not to renew the attack, withdrew the troops which had been sent across the Mississippi, and retreating on the 18th, re-embarked his force on the 27th. He proceeded to Mobile Bay, where Fort Bowyer was taken on 12 February, and next day news arrived that peace had been signed. Lambert returned to Europe in time to command the tenth brigade of British infantry at the Battle of Waterloo. The brigade joined the army from Ghent only on the morning of 18 June, and was at first posted in reserve at Mont St. Jean. After 3 P.M. it was moved up to the front line to support the fifth (Picton's) division, and one of its regiments, the 27th, which had to be kept in square near La Haye Sainte, lost two-thirds of its men, a heavier loss than that of any other regiment. Lambert was mentioned in Wellington's dispatch, and received the thanks of parliament, the order of Order of St. Vladimir, 3rd class, and that of Military Order of Max Joseph (commander). He commanded the eighth infantry brigade in the army of occupation in France. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825, and general on 23 November 1841. He was given the colonelcy of the 10th regiment on 18 January 1824, and the Grand Cross of the Bath (G.C.B.) on 19 July 1838. He died at Weston House, Thames Ditton, on 14 September 1847, aged 75. Family In 1816, he married Mary Morant, a daughter of John Morant of Brocklehurst Park, New Forest. He was the son of Captain Robert Lambert RN, younger brother of Rear Admiral Robert Lambert RN and older brother of Captain Henry Lambert RN, Major General Samuel Lambert and Admiral Sir George Lambert RN.http://www.napoleon- series.org/research/biographies/BritishGenerals/c_Britishgenerals92.html Cricket Lambert was also an English amateur cricketer who made 12 known appearances in first-class cricket matches from 1794 to 1810.

Since January 2017, the commune has formed part of the conurbation of Grand Lac, following the fusion of the former Communaut√© de communes de Chautagne into this larger agglomeration. At 175 ha, the smallest commune in the region of Chautagne, Conjux extends for 5 km along the northwestern coastline of Lac du Bourget; it is bounded to the north by the Canal de Savi√®res and backed by Mount Landard to the west. Reflecting its mixed role as a residential and recreational location, 42% of its residential buildings are counted as secondary residences. The name of the commune is believed to be derived, via the forms 'Conziacum' (early 12th Century), 'Conjiacum' (1481) and 'Conjeux' (1780), from late Latin 'Congiacum', meaning the 'domain of Congius.' Gros, Dictionnaire √©tymologique des noms de lieu de la SavoieMich√®le Brocard, Lucien Lagier-Bruno, Andr√© Palluel-Guillard, 'Histoire des communes savoyardes : Aix-les-Bains et ses environs ‚Äì Les Bauges ‚Äì La Chartreuse ‚Äì La Combe de Savoie ‚Äì Montm√©lian (vol. 2)', Roanne, √âditions Horvath, 1984, p. 358‚Äì361. Its derivation is not related to the Latin homonym, 'conjux' (spouse). Fishing was traditionally the mainstay of the village, but today there remain only two professional fishermen based in the commune. The Port of Conjux is now largely used for recreational boating and amateur fishing. Economic activity is largely confined to small businesses, including holiday accommodation and a restaurant, and salaried work in nearby cities such as Aix-les-Bains and Chamb√©ry. The commune maintains a municipal camping ground, Les Babelles, and a bathing beach, as well as managing the boating harbour. The commune is also undertaking a major plan for the development of the port and beach area, the 'Port-Plage' project,\\\\- in French entailing enlargement of the port, opening up of the Biez rivulet (currently partially piped underground to the lake) to restore the natural waterway, and improvements to tourist and fishing facilities. The chapel of Saints-Cr√©pin- et-Cr√©pinien at Conjux dates in part from the 15th century. Formerly a parish church, it was not restored to that status following the reestablishment of worship after the Concordat of 1801. It was established as a vicarial chapel in 1883. The building was badly damaged in an earthquake in 1826, fell in ruins in 1886, and was restored in several stages (1890, 1938 and 1978). Official site of the Commune of Conjux (in French). The rebuilt neoGothic nave has a ribbed vault, linked to a side chapel comprising remains of the 15th Century building. The interior includes a polished wood statue of the Madonna and Child from the 14th Century, Gallo-Roman remains including an inscribed funerary stone, and an altar of Cybele. An underwater archaeological site, Conjux-le-Port-3, includes visible remains from prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, with evidence of occupation from Neolithic to late Bronze Age times and the discernable outline of the now submerged village. Dendrochronological evidence dates the Conjux-Port 1 site from between 832 and 813 BC. The site was classified as an historical monument in 2011.

Geography Entremont-le-Vieux is a landlocked village close to many water streams and winter sports resorts (including Le D√©sert d'Entremont). It is mainly the Cozon river and its tributaries that flow into the valley that have shaped the landscape. One of the main features of the town is the dispersion of a set of houses in 26 villages. The main passes located in the town are the col de la Cluse, the col du Cucheron southwest and the col du Mollard northwest. =Neighboring municipalities= Neighboring communes of Entremont-le-Vieux are Saint-Pierre d'Entremont in Savoie, Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Saint-Jean-de-Couz and Corbel. History The parish of Notre-Dame d'Epernay is the lordship of the Entremonts valley. The church of Entremont-le-Vieux, Notre-Dame d'Epernay, was rebuilt in the mid-19th century to its present location, sufficiently large to accommodate the 1,800 people of this time. A fire destroyed the building in 1653. the place was renovated in 1844. Ravaged partly in 1995, the tower and the bells (which dated from 1654) have been completely redone. In 1934, was built at Entremont-le-Vieux the renowned Fruiti√®re des Entremonts (for milk, cheese and local products). In 1988, was discovered inside a cave on the slopes of the Massif du Granier, one of the most important archaeological sites of cave bears. This discovery has led to an extensive research on the existence of these animals in the valley. =Trivia= Entremont-le-Vieux was formerly called Epernay. This name was retained to designate the village, even today, for many inhabitants of the town. Population and society =Demographics= =Cultural events and festivities= Each year at the end of August, takes place at Entremont-le-Vieux a peasants and artisans party.

Route description Route 183 begins at the Connecticut state line in Colebrook, Connecticut as a northern continuation of that state's Route 183\\\\. Massachusetts's Route 183 runs northwest through the town of Sandisfield as Sandy Brook Road. The route runs northwest through the wooded sections of Sandisfield, soon crossing into the town of New Marlborough, changing monikers to New Marlborough Road. Reaching downtown New Marlborough, Route 183 intersects with Route 57 (New Marlborough Sandisfield Center Road). Route 183 and Route 57 become concurrent through downtown New Marlborough, changing names to Hartsville New Marlborough Road. After downtown, the two routes meander to the northwest as a two-lane rural road through Berkshire County, reaching the village of Hartsville. Route 183 and Route 57 crosses into the town of Monterey and parallel the shores of Lake Buel. Now known as Pixley Road, the routes reach a junction with Route 23 (Main Road). Route 183 south approaching the junction with Route 102 in Stockbridge Route 57 terminates while Route 183 joins Route 23 along Monterey Road, running westward before changing names to State Road.

Janus particles are special types of nanoparticles or microparticles whose surfaces have two or more distinct physical properties. Janus Particle Synthesis, Self-Assembly and Applications, Editors: Shan Jiang, Steve Granick, Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge 2013, https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/ebook/978-1-84973-510-0This unique surface of Janus particles allows two different types of chemistry to occur on the same particle. The simplest case of a Janus particle is achieved by dividing the particle into two distinct parts, each of them either made of a different material, or bearing different functional groups. For example, a Janus particle may have one-half of its surface composed of hydrophilic groups and the other half hydrophobic groups, the particles might have two surfaces of different color, fluorescence, or magnetic properties. This gives these particles unique properties related to their asymmetric structure and/or functionalization. History The term \\"Janus Particle\\" was coined by author Leonard Wibberley in his 1962 novel The Mouse on the Moon as a science- fictional device for space travel. The term was first used in a real-world scientific context by C. Casagrande et al. in 1988Casagrande C., Veyssie M., C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris), 306 11, 1423, 1988. to describe spherical glass particles with one of the hemispheres hydrophilic and the other hydrophobic. In that work, the amphiphilic beads were synthesized by protecting one hemisphere with varnish and chemically treating the other hemisphere with a silane reagent. This method resulted in a particle with equal hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. In 1991, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes mentioned the term \\"Janus\\" particle in his Nobel lecture. Janus particles are named after the two faced Roman god Janus because these particles may be said to have \\"two faces\\" since they possess two distinct types of properties. de Gennes pushed for the advancement of Janus particles by pointing out these \\"Janus grains\\" have the unique property of densely self-assembling at liquid‚Äìliquid interfaces, while allowing material transport to occur through the gaps between the solid amphiphilic particles. In 1976 Nick Sheridon of Xerox Corporation patented a Twisting Ball Panel Display, where he refers to a \\"plurality of particles which have an electrical anisotropy.\\"United States Patent 4,126,854 '''Sheridon''' 21 November 1978 \\\\----Twisting ball panel display Although the term \\"Janus particles\\" was not yet used, Lee and coworkers also reported particles matching this description in 1985. They introduced asymmetric polystyrene/polymethylmethacrylate lattices from seeded emulsion polymerization. One year later, Casagrande and Veyssie reported the synthesis of glass beads that were made hydrophobic on only one hemisphere using octadecyl trichlorosilane, while the other hemisphere was protected with a cellulose varnish. The glass beads were studied for their potential to stabilize emulsification processes. Then several years later, Binks and Fletcher investigated the wettability of Janus beads at the interface between oil and water. They concluded Janus particles are both surface-active and amphiphilic, whereas homogeneous particles are only surface-active. Twenty years later, a plethora of Janus particles of different sizes, shapes and properties, with applications in textile, sensors, stabilization of emulsions, and magnetic field imaging have been reported. Variety of janus particles in sizes 10um to 53um in diameter are currently commercially available from Cospheric, who holds a patent on Hemispherical Coating Method for Microelements United States Patent 8,501,272 Lipovetskaya , et al. 6 August 2013 \\\\----Hemispherical coating method for micro-elements .  Synthesis  The synthesis of Janus nanoparticles requires the ability to selectively create each side of a nanometer-sized particle with different chemical properties in a cost-effective and reliable way that produces the particle of interest in high yield. Initially, this was a difficult task, but within the last 10 years, methods have been refined to make it easier. Currently, three major methods are used in the synthesis of Janus nanoparticles. =Masking= Schematic view of the synthesis of Janus nanoparticles via masking. 1) Homogeneous nanoparticles are placed in or on a surface in such a way that only one hemisphere is exposed. 2) The exposed surface is exposed to a chemical 3) which change its properties. 4) The masking agent is then removed, releasing the Janus nanoparticles. (a) Schematic representation of a masking microfabrication process. After creating a monolayer of fluorescent particles, bilayers of 1:10 Ti/Au are deposited on the top half of particles. The wafer is then placed in a beaker with 2 ml DI water and sonicated for 2 h to resuspend them. (b) SEM micrographs show the three types of JPs fabricated. Scale bar represents 500 nm. Masking was one of the first techniques developed for the synthesis of Janus nanoparticles. This technique was developed by simply taking synthesis techniques of larger Janus particles and scaling down to the nanoscale. Masking, as the name suggests, involves the protection of one side of a nanoparticle followed by the modification of the unprotected side and the removal of the protection. Two masking techniques are common to produce Janus particles, evaporative deposition and a technique where the nanoparticle is suspended at the interface of two phases. However, only the phase separation technique scales well to the nanoscale. The phase interface method involves trapping homogeneous nanoparticles at the interface of two immiscible phases. These methods typically involve the liquid‚Äìliquid and liquid‚Äìsolid interfaces, but a gas‚Äìliquid interface method has been described. The liquid‚Äìliquid interface method is best exemplified by Gu et al., who made an emulsion from water and an oil and added nanoparticles of magnetite. The magnetite nanoparticles aggregated at the interface of the water-oil mixture, forming a Pickering emulsion. Then, silver nitrate was added to the mixture, resulting in the deposition of silver nanoparticles on the surface of the magnetite nanoparticles. These Janus nanoparticles were then functionalized by the addition of various ligands with specific affinity for either the iron or silver. This method can also use gold or iron-platinum instead of magnetite. A similar method is the gas‚Äìliquid interface method developed by Pradhan et al. In this method, hydrophobic alkane thiolate gold nanoparticles were placed in water, causing the formation of a monolayer of the hydrophobic gold nanoparticles on the surface. Air pressure was then increased, forcing the hydrophobic layer to be pushed into the water, decreasing the contact angle. When the contact angle was at the desired level, a hydrophilic thiol, 3-mercaptopropane-1,2-diol, was added to the water, causing the hydrophilic thiol to competitively replace the hydrophobic thiols, resulting in the formation of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles. The liquid‚Äìliquid and gas‚Äìliquid interface methods do have an issue where the nanoparticles can rotate in solution, causing the deposition of silver on more than one face. A liquid‚Äìliquid/liquid‚Äìsolid hybrid interface method was first introduced by Granick et al. as a solution to this liquid‚Äìliquid method problem. In this method, molten paraffin wax was substituted for the oil, and silica nanoparticles for the magnetite. When the solution was cooled, the wax solidified, trapping half of each silica nanoparticle in the wax surface, leaving the other half of the silica exposed. The water was then filtered off and the wax-trapped silica nanoparticles were then exposed to a methanol solution containing (amino- propyl)triethoxysilane, which reacted with the exposed silica surfaces of the nanoparticles. The methanol solution was then filtered off and the wax was dissolved with chloroform, freeing the newly made Janus particles. Liu et al. reported the synthesis of acorn- and mushroom- shaped silica‚Äìaminopropyl‚Äìtrimethoxysilane Janus nanoparticles using the hybrid liquid‚Äìliquid/liquid‚Äìsolid method developed by Granick et al. They exposed homogenous aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane functionalized silica nanoparticles embedded in wax to an ammonium fluoride solution, which etched away the exposed surface. The liquid‚Äìliquid/liquid‚Äìsolid hybrid method also has some drawbacks; when exposed to the second solvent for functionalization, some of the nanoparticles may be released from the wax, resulting in homogenous instead of Janus nanoparticles. This can partially be corrected by using waxes with higher melting points or performing functionalization at lower temperatures. However, these modifications still result in significant loss. Cui et al. designed a more enduring mask made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer film to create a liquid‚Äìliquid/liquid‚Äìsolid interface. The exposed-to-be-modified portion of particle surface can be adjusted by controlling the PDMS curing temperature and time, thus the embedment depth of the particles. The advantage of this fabrication method is that PDMS is inert and enduring in many wet chemistry solutions, and various metal or oxides or alloys such as silver, gold, nickel, titania can modify the exposed surface. Granick et al., in another paper, demonstrated a possible fix by using a liquid‚Äìliquid/gas‚Äìsolid phase hybrid method by first immobilizing silica nanoparticles in paraffin wax using the previously discussed liquid‚Äìsolid phase interface method, and then filtering off the water. The resulting immobilized nanoparticles were then exposed to silanol vapor produced by bubbling nitrogen or argon gas through liquid silanol, causing the formation of a hydrophilic face. The wax was then dissolved in chloroform, releasing the Janus nanoparticles. An example of a more traditionial liquid‚Äìsolid technique has been described by Sardar et al. by beginning with the immobilization of gold nanoparticles on a silanized glass surface. Then the glass surface was exposed to 11-mercapto-1-undecanol, which bonded to the exposed hemispheres of the gold nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were then removed from the slide using ethanol containing 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid, which functionalized the previously masked hemispheres of the nanoparticles. =Self-assembly= Block copolymers Schematic representation of the synthesis of Janus nanoparticles using the block copolymer self-assembly method This method uses the well-studied methods of producing block copolymers with well-defined geometries and compositions across a large variety of substrates. Synthesis of Janus particles by self-assembly via block copolymers was first described in 2001 by Erhardt et al. They produced a triblock polymer from polymethylacrylate, polystyrene and low-molecular-weight polybutadiene. The polystyrene and polymethylacrylate formed alternating layers in between which polybutadiene sat in nanosized spheres. The blocks were then cross-linked and dissolved in THF, and after several washing steps, yielded spherical Janus particles with polystyrene on one face and polymethylacrylate on the other, with a polybutadiene core. The production of Janus spheres, cylinders, sheets, and ribbons is possible using this method by adjusting the molecular weights of the blocks in the initial polymer and also the degree of cross-linking. Competitive adsorption The key aspect of competitive absorption involves two substrates that phase-separate due to one or more opposite physical or chemical properties. When these substrates are mixed with a nanoparticle, typically gold, they maintain their separation and form two faces. A good example of this technique has been demonstrated by Vilain et al., where phosphinine-coated gold nanoparticles were exposed to long-chain thiols, resulting in substitution of the phosphinine ligands in a phase- separated manner to produce Janus nanoparticles. Phase separation was proven by showing the thiols formed one locally pure domain on the nanoparticle using FT-IR. Jakobs et al. demonstrated a major issue with the competitive adsorption method when they attempted to synthesize amphiphilic gold Janus nanoparticles using the competitive adsorption of hydrophobic and hydrophilic thiols. The synthesis demonstrated was quite simple and only involved two steps. First gold nanoparticles capped with tetra-n-octylammonium bromide were produced. Then the capping agent was removed followed by the addition of various ratios of hydrophilic disulfide functionalized ethylene oxide and hydrophobic disulfide functionalized oligo(p-phenylenevinylene). They then attempted to prove that phase separation on the particle surface occurred by comparing the contact angles of water on the surface of a monolayer of the Janus particles with nanoparticles made with only the hydrophobic or hydrophobic ligands. Instead the results of this experiment showed that while there was some phase separation, it was not complete. This result highlights that the ligand choice is extremely important and any changes may result in incomplete phase separation. =Phase separation= Scheme of the basic principle of phase separation method of producing Janus nanoparticles: Two incompatible substances (A and B) were mixed to form a nanoparticle. A and B then separate into their own domains while still part of a single nanoparticle. This method involves the mixing of two or more incompatible substances which then separate into their own domains while still part of a single nanoparticle. These methods can involve the production of Janus nanoparticles of two inorganic, as well as two organic, substances. Typical organic phase separation methods use cojetting of polymers to produce Janus nanoparticles. This technique is exemplified by the work of Yoshid et al. to produce Janus nanoparticles where one hemisphere has affinity for human cells, while the other hemisphere has no affinity for human cells. This was achieved by cojetting polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers which have no affinity for human cells with biotinylated polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers, which when exposed to streptavidin-modified antibodies, obtain an affinity for human cells. The inorganic phase separation methods are diverse and vary greatly depending on the application. The most common method uses the growth of a crystal of one inorganic substance on or from another inorganic nanoparticle. A unique method has been developed by Gu et al., where iron- platinum nanoparticles were coated with sulfur reacted with cadmium acetylacetonate, trioctylphosphineoxide, and hexadecane-1,2-diol at 100 ¬∞C to produce nanoparticles with an iron-platinum core and an amorphous cadmium- sulfur shell. The mixture was then heated to 280 ¬∞C, resulting in a phase transition and a partial eruption of the Fe-Pt from the core, creating a pure Fe-Pt sphere attached to the CdS-coated nanoparticle. A new method of synthesizing inorganic Janus nanoparticles by phase separation has recently been developed by Zhao and Gao. In this method, they explored the use of the common homogeneous nanoparticle synthetic method of flame synthesis. They found when a methanol solution containing ferric triacetylacetonate and tetraethylorthosilicate was burned, the iron and silicon components formed an intermixed solid, which undergoes phase separation when heated to approximately 1100 ¬∞C to producemaghemite-silica Janus nanoparticles. Additionally, they found it was possible to modify the silica after producing the Janus nanoparticles, making it hydrophobic by reacting it with oleylamine.  Properties and applications  =Self-assembly behavior of Janus nanoparticles= Janus particles' two or more distinct faces give them special properties in solution. In particular, they have been observed to self- assemble in a specific way in aqueous or organic solutions. In the case of spherical Janus micelles having hemispheres of polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), aggregation into clusters has been observed in various organic solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran. Similarly, Janus discs composed of sides of PS and poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) (PtBMA) can undergo back-to-back stacking into superstructures when in an organic solution. These particular Janus particles form aggregates in organic solvents considering that both sides of these particles are soluble in the organic solvent. It appears that the slight selectivity of the solvent is able to induce self- assembly of the particles into discrete clusters of Janus particles. This type of aggregation does not occur for either standard block copolymers nor for homogeneous particles and thus is a feature specific to Janus particles. In an aqueous solutions, two kinds of biphasic particles can be distinguished. The first type are particles which are truly amphiphilic and possess one hydrophobic and one hydrophilic side. The second type has two water-soluble, yet chemically distinct, sides. To illustrate the first case, extensive studies have been carried out with spherical Janus particles composed of one hemisphere of water-soluble PMAA and another side of water-insoluble polystyrene. In these studies, the Janus particles were found to aggregate on two hierarchical levels. The first type of self-assembled aggregates look like small clusters, similar to what is found for the case of Janus particles in an organic solution. The second type is noticeably larger than the first and has been termed 'super micelles'. Unfortunately, the structure of the supermicelles is unknown so far; however, they may be similar to multilamellar vesicles. For the second case of Janus particles which contain two distinct, but still water-soluble sides, the work of Granick's group provides some insight. Their research deals with the clustering of dipolar (zwitterionic), micronsized Janus particles, whose two sides are both fully water-soluble. Zwitterionic Janus particles do not behave like classical dipoles, since their size is much larger than the distance at which electrostatic attractions are strongly felt. The study of zwitterionic Janus particles once again demonstrates their ability to form defined clusters. However, this particular type of Janus particle prefers to aggregate into larger clusters since this is more energetically favorable because each cluster carries a macroscopic dipole which allows the aggregation of already-formed clusters into larger assemblies. Compared to aggregates formed through van der Waals interactions for homogenous particles, the shapes of the zwitterionic Janus nanoclusters are different and the Janus clusters are less dense and more asymmetric. =Self-assembly modification using pH= The self-assembly of certain types of Janus particles may be controlled by modifying the pH of their solution. Lattuada et al. prepared nanoparticles with one side coated with a pH- responsive polymer (polyacrylic acid, PAA) and the other with either a positively charged polymer (poly dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate, PDMAEMA), a negatively charged, pH-insensitive polymer, or a temperature-responsive polymer (poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide, PNIPAm). In changing the pH of their solution, they noticed a change in the clustering of their Janus nanoparticles. At very high pH values, where PDMAEMA is uncharged while PAA is highly charged, the Janus nanoparticles were very stable in solution. However, below a pH of 4, when PAA is uncharged and PDMAEMA is positively charged, they formed finite clusters. At intermediate pH values, they found that the Janus nanoparticles were unstable due to dipolar interaction between the positively and negatively charged hemispheres. =Reversibility of cluster formation and control of cluster size= Control of cluster size for in the aggregation of Janus nanoparticles has also been demonstrated. Lattuada et al. achieved control of the cluster size of Janus particles with one face PAA and the other either PDMAEMA or PNIPAm by mixing small amounts of these Janus nanoparticles with PAA-coated particles. One unique feature of these clusters was stable particles could be recovered reversibly when high pH conditions were restored. Furthermore, Janus nanoparticles functionalized with PNIPAm showed controlled and reversible aggregation could be achieved by increasing the temperature above the lower critical solubility temperature of PNIPAm. = Amphiphilic properties = A significant characteristic of Janus nanoparticles is the capability of having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. Many research groups have investigated the surface activities of nanoparticles with amphiphilic properties. In 2006, Janus nanoparticles, made from gold and iron oxides, were compared with their homogeneous counterparts by measuring the ability of the particles to reduce the interfacial tension between water and n-hexane. Experimental results indicated Janus nanoparticles are considerably more surface-active than homogeneous particles of comparable size and chemical nature. Furthermore, increasing the amphiphilic character of the particles can increase the interfacial activity. The ability of Janus nanoparticles to lower interfacial tension between water and n-hexane confirmed previous theoretical predictions on their ability to stabilize Pickering emulsions. In 2007, the amphiphilic nature of the Janus nanoparticles was examined by measuring the adhesion force between the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the particle surface. The stronger interactions between the hydrophilic AFM tip and the hydrophilic side of the Janus nanoparticles were reflected by a greater adhesion force. The Janus nanoparticles were dropcast onto both hydrophobically and hydrophilically modified substrates. The hydrophobic hemisphere of the Janus particles was exposed when a hydrophilic substrate surface was used, resulting in disparities in adhesion force measurements. Thus, the Janus nanoparticles adopted a conformation that maximized the interactions with the substrate surface. The nature of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles to orient themselves spontaneously at the interface between oil and water has been well known. This behavior allows considering amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles as analogues of molecular surfactants for the stabilization of emulsions. In 2005, spherical silica particles with amphiphilic properties were prepared by partial modification of the external surface with an alkylsilane agent. These particles form spherical assemblies encapsulating water-immiscible organic compounds in aqueous media by facing their hydrophobic alkylsilylated side to the inner organic phase and their hydrophilic side to the outer aqueous phase, thus stabilizing oil droplets in water. In 2009, hydrophilic surface of silica particles was made partially hydrophobic by adsorbing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. These amphiphilic nanoparticles spontaneously assembled at the water-dichloromethane interface. In 2010, Janus particles composed from silica and polystyrene, with the polystyrene portion loaded with nanosized magnetite particles, were used to form kinetically stable oil-in-water emulsions that can be spontaneously broken on application of an external magnetic field. Such Janus materials will find applications in magnetically controlled optical switches and other related areas. The first real applications of Janus nanoparticles were in polymer synthesis. In 2008, spherical amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles, having one polystyrene and one poly(methyl methacrylate) side, were shown to be effective as compatibilizing agents of multigram scale compatibilization of two immiscible polymer blends, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). The Janus nanoparticles oriented themselves at the interface of the two polymer phases, even under high temperature and shear conditions, allowing the formation of much smaller domains of poly(methyl methacrylate) in a polystyrene phase. The performance of the Janus nanoparticles as compatibilizing agents was significantly superior to other state-of-the-art compatibilizers, such as linear block copolymers. =Stabilizers in emulsions= A similar application of Janus nanoparticles as stabilizers was shown in emulsion polymerization. In 2008, spherical amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles were applied for the first time to the emulsion polymerization of styrene and n-butyl acrylate. The polymerization did not require additives or miniemulsion polymerization techniques, as do other Pickering emulsion polymerizations. Also, by applying Janus nanoparticles, the emulsion polymerization produced very well-controlled particle sizes with low polydispersities. =Janus interphase catalyst= Janus interphase catalyst is a new generation of heterogeneous catalysts, which is capable to do organic reactions on the interface of two phases via the formation of Pickering emulsion. =Catalyst in hydrogen peroxide decomposition= In 2010, spherical silica Janus nanoparticles with one side coated with platinum were used for the first time to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The platinum particle catalyzes the surface chemical reaction: 2H2O2 ‚Üí O2 \\\\+ 2H2O. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide created Janus catalytic nanomotors, the motion of which was analyzed experimentally and theoretically using computer simulations. The motion of the spherical Janus nanoparticles was found to agree with the predictions of computed simulations. Ultimately, catalytic nanomotors have practical applications in delivering chemical payloads in microfluidic chips, eliminating pollution in aquatic media, removing toxic chemicals within biological systems, and performing medical procedures. In 2013, based on the computer simulation results it has been shown that self- propelled Janus particles can be used for direct demonstration of the non- equilibrium phenomenon, ratchet effect. Ratcheting of Janus particles can be orders of magnitude stronger than for ordinary thermal potential ratchets and thus easily experimentally accessible. In particular, autonomous pumping of a large mixture of passive particles can be induced by just adding a small fraction of Janus particles. =Water-repellent fibers= In 2011, Janus nanoparticles were shown to be applicable in textiles. Water-repellent fibers can be prepared by coating polyethylene terephthalate fabric with amphiphilic spherical Janus nanoparticles. The Janus particles bind with the hydrophilic reactive side of the textile surface, while the hydrophobic side is exposed to the environment, thus providing the water-repellent behavior. A Janus particle size of 200 nm was found to deposit on the surface of fibers and were very efficient for the design of water-repellent textiles. =Applications in biological sciences= The groundbreaking progress in the biological sciences has led to a drive towards custom made materials with precisely designed physical/chemical properties at the nanoscale level. Inherently Janus nanoparticles play a crucial role in such applications. In 2009, a new type of bio-hybrid material composed of Janus nanoparticles with spatially controlled affinity towards human endothelial cells was reported. These nanoparticles were synthesized by selective surface modification with one hemisphere exhibiting high binding affinity for human endothelial cells and the other hemisphere being resistant towards cell binding. The Janus nanoparticles were fabricated via electrohydrodynamic jetting of two polymer liquid solutions. When incubated with human endothelial cells, these Janus nanoparticles exhibited expected behavior, where one face binds toward human endothelial cells, while the other face was not bonding. These Janus nanoparticles not only bound to the top of the human endothelial cells, but also associated all around the perimeter of cells forming a single particle lining. The biocompatibility between the Janus nanoparticles and cells was excellent. The concept is to eventually design probes based on Janus nanoparticles to attain directional information about cell-particle interactions. Nanocorals In 2010, a new type of cellular probe synthesized from Janus nanoparticles called a nanocoral, combining cellular specific targeting and biomolecular sensing, was presented. Nanocoral is composed of polystyrene and gold hemispheres. The polystyrene hemisphere of the nanocoral was selectively functionalized with antibodies to target receptors of specific cells. This was demonstrated by functionalizing the polystyrene region with antibodies that specifically attached to breast cancer cells. The gold region of the nanocoral surface was used for detecting and imaging. Thus, the targeting and sensing mechanisms were decoupled and could be separately engineered for a particular experiment. Additionally, the polystyrene region may also be used as a carrier for drugs and other chemicals by surface hydrophobic adsorption or encapsulation, making the nanocoral a possible multifunctional nanosensor. Imaging and magnetolytic therapy Also in 2010, Janus nanoparticles synthesized from hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles on one side and poly(styrene-block-allyl alcohol) on the other side were used for imaging and magnetolytic therapy. The magnetic side of the Janus nanoparticles responded well to external magnetic stimuli. The nanoparticles were quickly attached to the cell surfaces using a magnetic field. Magnetolytic therapy was achieved through magnetic field-modulated cell membrane damage. First, the nanoparticles were brought close in contact with the tumor cells, and then a spinning magnetic field was applied. After 15 minutes, the majority of the tumor cells were killed. Magnetic Janus nanoparticles could serve as the basis for potential applications in medicine and electronics. Quick responses to external magnetic fields could become an effective approach for targeted imaging, therapy in vitro and in vivo, and cancer treatment. Similarly, a quick response to magnetic fields is also desirable to fabricate smart displays, opening new opportunities in electronics and spintronics. In 2011, silica-coated Janus nanoparticles, composed of silver oxide and iron oxide (Fe2O3), were prepared in one step with scalable flame aerosol technology. These hybrid plasmonic-magnetic nanoparticles bear properties that are applicable in bioimaging, targeted drug delivery, in vivo diagnosis, and therapy. The purpose of the nanothin SiO2 shell was to reduce the release of toxic Ag+ ions from the nanoparticle surface to live cells. As a result, these hybrid nanoparticles showed no cyctotoxicity during bioimaging and remained stable in suspension with no signs of agglomeration or settling, thus enabling these nanoparticles as biocompatible multifunctional probes for bioimaging. Next, by labeling their surfaces and selectively binding them on the membrane of live-tagged Raji and HeLa cells, this demonstrated the nanoparticles as biomarkers and their detection under dark-field illumination was achieved. These new hybrid Janus nanoparticles overcame the individual limitations of Fe2O3 (poor particle stability in suspension) and of Ag (toxicity) nanoparticles, while retaining the desired magnetic properties of Fe2O3 and the plasmonic optical properties of Ag. =Applications in electronics= The potential application of Janus particles was first demonstrated by Nisisako et al., who made use of the electrical anisotropy of Janus particles filled with white and black pigments in both hemispheres. These particles were used to make switchable screens by placing a thin layer of these spheres between two electrodes. Upon changing the applied electric field, the particles orient their black sides to the anode and their white sides to the cathode. Thus the orientation and the color of the display can be changed by simply reversing the electric field. With this method, it may be possible to make very thin and environmentally friendly displays.

It is located in the Cinquantenaire Park and was previously called the Cinquantenaire Museum (, ). It is one of the largest museums in Europe. History The museum's first collections were assembled during the reigns of the Dukes of Burgundy and subsequently the Habsburg archdukes, and were placed in various locations in Brussels, their capital. In 1847, the newly formed Kingdom of Belgium acquired the artworks which were placed in the Halle Gate under the name of (\\"Royal Museum of Armour, Antiquities and Ethnology\\"). By 1889, the gate had become too small and the collections were relocated to the Cinquantenaire Park (except for the armour and weapons which still remain in the gate). The Cinquantenaire used to be a military training facility until the 1880 National Exhibition when the large iron, glass and steel Cinquantenaire Palace was built with a military museum in the north wing. During the interwar period, the collections grew considerably due to Belgian scientific expeditions around the world most notably in Apamea (Syria), in Egypt by the Egyptologist Jean Capart, and in Easter Island in 1936, or by excavations in archaeological sites across Belgium. Many wealthy Belgians also donated artworks to the museum. In the mid-20th century, a new wing was built in the west of the building to house the classical antiquity collections. The museum was called the Cinquantenaire Museum but changed its name to the Art & History Museum in 2018. Collection The Art & History Museum's collections are divided into four parts: * National archaeology * Classical antiquity * Non-European civilisations * European decorative arts =National archaeology= The museum has a large collection of national archaeological pieces dating from prehistory, the Gallo-Roman period, to the Merovingian period (). Prehistory The Prehistory room presents the vestiges of cultures and civilisations attested in what is now Belgium from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age. Tools, vases and jewellery are put back into context thanks to models and reconstructions which allow visitors to get an idea of the evolution of daily life during those different periods. Gallo- Roman Belgium The conquest of Gaul by Caesar () marked the beginning of a new era for Belgium. The development of craftsmanship is confirmed by the richness and diversity of artefacts dating from that period: ceramic dishes, fibulae, bronze figurines, as well as glass, bronze and silver containers, the most refined examples of which come from rich funerary furniture. The reconstructions of a Roman villa facade, a heating system, and even a painted wall decor, embody the Gallo-Roman culture. Merovingian civilisation Merovingian tomb with funerary items, mid 6th century AD The Merovingian civilisation is known to us mainly through the worship of the dead. In this context, eight tombs are reconstructed in the room presenting this period. Furniture from other graves is distributed in themed display cases where visitors can admire jewellery, belt buckles and other fibulae. =Classical antiquity= The museum's collection houses early art from the ancient Middle- Eastern, Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilisations. Middle East The Middle East, one of the cradles of civilisation, is presented through reliefs, jewellery and many earthen objects dating from prehistoric times to the dawn of the Islamic period (). The cylinder-seals, personal seals and Luristan bronzes make up some of the highlights of the collection. File:Statuette f√©minine - p√©riode Halaf (5500 av.

The highlight of this set is the reconstruction of the store designed by Victor Horta for Wolfers silversmiths, which serves as a backdrop for a splendid selection of Art Nouveau and Art Deco works. In the Cinquantenaire Park, a small pavilion is associated with these collections. Designed by Horta, it houses the bas-relief of the Human Passions, sculpted by Jef Lambeaux.

Beldam was born at Shepreth Hall (Cambridgeshire), son of William Beldam and Marianne (n√©e Woodham), and died at Banyers, Royston (Hertfordshire) and is buried in the family vault at Royston Church. He studied at St Peter's College, University of Cambridge, graduating on 9 October 1818, having entered the Middle Temple on 22 January 1818 to study Law. In his initial appointment to the Bar in 1825, he worked the [Norfolk Circuit] but had to retire from it owing to poor health. He then established a practice at the Old Palace Court, Royston. He subsequently resigned his practice so that he could devote his time to the abolitionist movement, with which he first became involved in 1826, joining the Anti-Slavery Society in London in 1827. It was his publication of an open letter to Lord Dacre in that year that first brought him recognition for his anti-slavery work, when he came to the attention of Zachary Macaulay, the first editor of the Anti-Slavery Reporter and a former manager of a sugar plantation in Jamaica that used slaves. He subsequently became the editor or author of a majority of the Anti-Slavery Society's publications (generally anonymously) and, following the passing of the Emancipation Act in 1833, his legal expertise allowed him to become the official counsel for the society. Beldam's efforts at this period were mostly investigating abuses of the interim measures by which slaves would become apprenticed to their former masters as a means of allowing them to develop as fully independent, free citizens. Thanks to Beldam's careful collection of information, Parliament was forced to end the apprenticeship system in 1838, three years early. After this final liberation of slaves in the British colonies, Beldam became involved in international efforts to end slavery everywhere. He joined the Society for the Extinction of the Slave Trade and for the Civilisation of Africa, whose president was the Prince Consort, Albert. He edited the proceedings of the Society's first general meeting on 1 June 1840, but the Society was doomed to vanish after the Niger expedition of 1841. In later life, he turned to antiquarian pursuits, re-investigating the medieval Royston Cave in 1852 with his friend Edmund Nunn (curator of Royston Museum). He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 1 May 1856 for his historical and archaeological researches. It was not until the middle of the twentieth century that his anti-slavery efforts became known, when his papers were presented to the National Library of Jamaica. A modest man, he refused two appointments he was offered by the Colonial Office, made no attempt to enter politics and generally maintained a low profile in the movement. Joseph did enjoy travel and was acquainted with such people as William Wordsworth and Francis Arundale. There are at least two watercolor paintings which were sketched and painted by both Joseph and Francis.

He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and received the IEEE Power Engineering Society (Singapore Chapter)'s Outstanding Engineer Award in 2000. He is also concurrently the Dean of Admissions of the university. Early life and accolades Goel is a native of New Delhi, India. He completed his undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering from Regional Engineering College, Warangal (now National Institute of Technology, Warangal) in India and obtained his PhD from Canada's University of Saskatchewan in 1991. The university offered him a teaching position, but he declined it because his wife could not tolerate the cold Canadian winters. Instead, he chose to come to NTU. His first lecture in NTU was an eye-opener for him ‚Äî the class had 450 students, which was much larger than the classes of about 60 students he used to teach in his undergraduate days. However, he learnt to overcome his fear of large classes very quickly and now teaches up to 1,000 students per lecture. In NTU, his students remembered him for his style of teaching, as well as his distinctive moustache and bald pate. He had started losing his hair from the age of 18; according to him, the baldness might be hereditary. In addition to his IEEE award, Goel had won 15 Teacher of the Year Awards in his time at NTU. YouTube video In 2006, Goel became a YouTube celebrity after someone uploaded a five-minute snippet of one of his lectures to the site, in which he mentioned humorous comments about him made by second-year students who had attended his circuit analysis classes. These comments were written in feedback forms which asked students to rate their lecturers and give feedback on how their teaching could be improved. Such comments included: Goel had collated the humorous quotes into a series of slides. During one of his lectures, he showed these slides to his students and later uploaded the video of the lecture to NTU's e-learning website, from where it found its way to YouTube. On Deepavali in 2006, Goel received an email from an old student who had noticed him on YouTube. He did not take much notice of it, but many such messages followed and he became known even on campus as \\"the YouTube guy\\". As of end-December 2007, the video had had 440,000 views on YouTube. Although Goel was initially worried that whoever had uploaded the video to YouTube might be disciplined by the school administration, they liked the video and praised him for being entertaining.

Development and design  The Hansa- Brandenburg CC (where the designation CC came from the initials of the financier of the Hansa Brandenburg works, Camillo Castiglioni) was designed by Ernst Heinkel during 1916 for use by the Austro-Hungarian Navy. It was a single engined, single seater flying boat, with a pusher engine mounted between the wings. It had single-bay wings, with the unusual \\"Star-Strutter\\" arrangement of bracing struts (where four Vee struts joined in the centre of the wing bay to result in a \\"star\\" arrangement) shared with the Hansa- Brandenburg D.I and the KDW. The CC was purchased both by Austro-Hungary and the Imperial German Navy. The Austro-Hungarian aircraft were powered by 119 kW (160 hp) Austro-Daimler or 130 kW (180 hp) Hiero engines and armed by a single 8 mm (.315 in) Schwarzlose machine gun. The German aircraft were powered by 110 kW (150 hp) Benz Bz.III engines and armed with one or two lMG 08/15 machine guns.Green and Swanborough 1994, p.83.

History The name comes from ‚Äò‚ÄôBecr‚Äô‚Äô, a Norse word for stream, together with the name of the Mortagne family, seigneurs of the village. Bec-de-Mortagne in the Pays de Caux is thought to be the birth-place of Turstin FitzRolf, standard bearer to William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, as he was described by the 12th-century chronicler Orderic Vitalis as from \\"Bec-en-Caux\\". Around 1175, Guillaume de Mortagne gave the parish church to the Archbishop of Rouen, ( Willelmi Becco of Moritania) who gave it to the chapter after his death, stipulating that the priest should have a third of the tithes and the canon two-thirds. A knight, Henri de Soteville, sought possession of the church. He was excommunicated, but having later submitted, the excommunication was lifted. In the 13th century, Bec-Moreteigne had 500 inhabitants and the parish priest was paid 15 pounds . The year 1562 saw the formal civil status of Bec de Mortagne granted and in 1824 it was joined with the former parish of Baigneville to form the present commune.

He held the record for the most Emmy nominations (47), and won 18 times, putting him at the top of his profession throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and well into the 1980s. He also won the Directors Guild of America's top TV award five times, six Ace awards and a Peabody award.  Career  Hemion began working in live television in New York City in the 1950s, particularly for the original The Tonight Show starring Steve Allen. In the 1960s, Hemion began concentrating on musical-variety shows, working with producer Gary Smith on a popular series of Kraft Music Hall specials for NBC- TV. Smith-Hemion Productions arguably defined the fast-paced look and glamorous style of the American comedy-variety genre, and influenced scores of later generations working in television. Hemion had a knack for balancing both visual and musical elements that made him a master of directing concert performance specials. He worked with such major stars as Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Barbra Streisand, Sammy Davis, Jr., Paul McCartney, Bette Midler, Shirley MacLaine, Julie Andrews, Elvis Presley, Burt Bacharach, The Muppets, and Luciano Pavarotti.

The film was written and directed by Richard Brooks, and stars Diane Keaton, Tuesday Weld, William Atherton, Richard Kiley, and Richard Gere. The film was a commercial success, earning $22.5 million,In 2016 dollars, the film would have earned $86.9 million.

While in college, Theresa lives with her repressive Polish-Irish Catholic parents, and suffers from severe body image issues following a childhood surgery for scoliosis that left a large scar on her back. Theresa later finds out that her scoliosis is congenital, and that her aunt had the same condition and committed suicide. As a result, Theresa is reluctant to have children of her own. Meanwhile, her beautiful \\"perfect\\" older sister, Katherine (Weld), has left her husband and embarked on a wild lifestyle involving multiple affairs, a secret abortion, recreational drug use, and a short-lived marriage to a Jewish man. Theresa finds first love, and loses her virginity, to her much older, married college professor Martin. He ends their affair just before her graduation, leaving Theresa feeling used and lonely. Theresa takes a job teaching deaf children, and proves to be a gifted and caring teacher. With Katherine's encouragement, she moves out of her parents' home and into an apartment in Katherine's building. She frequents a bar at night, where she meets Tony (Gere), a charming but vain Italian- American. She ends up taking Tony to her apartment, taking cocaine with him and sleeping with him. Tony leaves in a hurry, and gives her a Quaalude pill to counteract the cocaine. This causes her to oversleep, and she arrives very late for work the next day, angering her employer and students. Tony then disappears for a long while, and Theresa initially misses him. Through her job, Theresa also meets and dates an Irish-American welfare caseworker, James (Atherton). Her parents approve of the responsible James, seeing him as a potential husband for Theresa. However, the couple do not have sex, because James wants a traditional courtship, and a monogamous relationship. Theresa sees that as stifling her freedom. Although James initially seems nice, over time he appears to become controlling, and also disrespectful of Theresa. Moreover, he shows signs of being just as perverted and selfish as Tony. Meanwhile, Theresa begins to go out to more marginal places, and has sex with complete strangers, often older men. Tony eventually returns and acts as if nothing had happened. He barges in on Theresa while she is with another man, and chases the man away. Tony becomes controlling and abusive, and Theresa also discovers that he is a street hustler. She breaks up with Tony, but he stalks and harasses her, both at home and at her workplace. After imagining what could happen if Tony were to turn her in to the police as revenge, Theresa gathers up all of the drugs in her apartment and flushes them down the toilet. With the New Year approaching, Theresa resolves to turn over a new leaf and take control of her life. On New Year's Eve, Theresa meets Gary (Berenger) in a bar, who she cajoles into helping her avoid James. Gary has been living with his gay lover, but lies to Theresa, telling her that he has a pregnant wife in Florida. When they are in bed together at her apartment, Gary finds himself unable to achieve an erection. He then sniffs a \\"popper\\". Theresa tells him that it is OK if they do not have sex, but Gary misinterprets this as questioning his sexuality. In a rage, Gary attacks her, rapes her, and then stabs her repeatedly, killing her.

The film currently holds a \\"fresh\\" 65% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews, with the consensus \\"Diane Keaton gives an absolutely fearless performance in a sexual thriller whose ending will leave audiences trembling.\\" Some critics found the film lurid and muddled; a review by Frank Rich for Time magazine criticized Brooks for making \\"many crude miscalculations\\" in adapting the novel. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Keaton's performance but lamenting the \\"many loose ends and dead ends,\\" some of which he blamed on significant alterations to the novel's plot.Chicago Sun-Times Gene Siskel also awarded 3 out of 4 stars, writing that \\"Keaton is absolutely compelling in 'Looking for Mr. Goodbar,' even when the film is not.\\"Siskel, Gene (October 21, 1977). \\"Keaton worth seeing in 'Goodbar'\\".

The New York Times. 27. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called Keaton's performance \\"high among the year's finest\\" in a demanding role, and declared the film \\"powerful, sincere and overlong, and if the film raises questions about itself it is also thought-provoking.\\"Champlin, Charles (October 19, 1977). \\"Warm-Blooded 'Mr. Goodbar'\\".

John Simon noted that while the novel is set in New York City, the film is said to be located in San Francisco (though identifiably filmed in Chicago's Rush Street neighborhood). He also noted that \\"the main character is made considerably prettier, thus reducing the principal sources of her insecurity\\", as compared to her portrayal in the novel as somewhat of a \\"Plain Jane\\". Pauline Kael noted, \\"Richard Brooks [...] has laid a windy jeremiad about our permissive society on top of fractured film syntax. He's lost the erotic, pulpy morbidity that made the novel a compulsive read; the film is splintered, moralistic, tedious.\\" Author Judith Rossner \\"detested\\" the film,Pike, Rayner and Nancy. Rossner, Judith Louise. Encyclopedia.com (Accessed December 30, 2016). although she praised Keaton's performance. She somewhat callously added, \\"I feel like the mother who delivered her 13-year- old daughter to the door of Roman Polanski and didn't know what was going to happen.\\" =Scientific analysis= Robert O. Friedel, MD, has suggested that Theresa's behavior in the film is consistent with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.\\" Legacy Looking for Mr. Goodbar introduced Richard Gere, LeVar Burton and Tom Berenger, all as men whom Theresa encounters. Home video releases While the film was released on LaserDisc and VHS, it has never been officially released on DVD nor Blu-ray. In popular culture The film inspired the music video for the 1993 Madonna song \\"Bad Girl\\".Madonna: Bad Girl (Video 1993)-Connections-IMDB In the video, Madonna plays a woman who, like Theresa, engages in self-destructive behavior by drinking heavily and sleeping around with random men before she is ultimately murdered by a man she had selected for a one-night stand.

History South Gloucestershire can trace its history back to 1982 when Roger Durbin set up operations as Durbin‚Äôs Coaches. After steadily expanding over the years, in 1994 Durbin's Coaches was sold to Badgerline and incorporated into their Bristol Omnibus Company subsidiary, later being re-branded as First Durbin.Bristol Omnibus takeover Durbins Coaches. (Retrieved 27 March 2012) A non-compete clause in the contract of sale prevented Roger Durbin from operating bus services in the Bristol area for three years. Whilst Roger Durbin left the company, Tony Lavoie, the marketing manager stayed with the company, moving to City Line's Lawrence Hill depot as the general manager for the Durbin operations. After a few months Lavoie left to start up his own bus company, Leisure Travel. By 1997, with a fleet of 24 vehicles, Roger Durbin joined as a partner in the business, and in 1998 the company began trading as South Gloucestershire Bus Company with a blue and white livery. Also during 1998 the pair purchased a local taxi firm which they renamed South Gloucestershire Taxi Company with a similar fleet name as the bus business. Durbin took on the bus side of the business while Lavoie looked after the running of the taxi company. During 1999 the original Durbin‚Äôs Coaches business was reacquired from First Bristol, who had continued to trade as Durbin‚Äôs Coaches and then First Durbin as a ‚Äòlow cost‚Äô unit within First. The company rapidly expanded over the next few years winning various tenders for supported services from Bristol City Council and South Gloucestershire Council, at one point even operating route 620 from Bath to Stroud. During 2003 the goodwill and custom as well as the majority of the fleet of Eastville Coaches were bought from the proprietor Mr Phillips. A number of newer vehicles were brought in to update the fleet, however after 18 months the original Eastville Coaches began trading again and the coaches in the South Gloucestershire fleet with Eastville Coaches branding lost their fleet name and gained 'www.southgloucestershirebus.co.uk A Durbin Group Company‚Äô fleetnames. Also during 2003 the taxi operation was separated from the bus operation, which saw Lavoie leave the business. The company continued to expand, picking up contracts with the University of the West of England (UWE) for student transport, Axa and Orange for staff shuttles, Wessex Trains rail replacement and further tenders from Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils. The fleet mainly consisted of second hand vehicles such as Leyland Lynx and Leyland Titans, and Volvo B10Ms for the coach fleet. There were two Dennis Dart SLFs that were new to Durbin in 2003 for Orange and UWE work. In 2007 South Gloucestershire was named the most un-environmentally-friendly bus operator in the country. It was also named the worst for customer service, although this hasn't been formally recognised since, the level of service has remained poor.Oxford bus fleet greenest in UK Oxford Mail 17 October 2007 In June 2007 the bus operations of the company were sold to Rotala subsidiary Flights Hallmark.History RotalaAbout Wessex Rotala The sale included 68 buses and was completed in stages until 31 March 2008, this being dictated by Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils needing to approve the transfer of the routes and because the licence was held in the name of the owners, not the company, so the services had to change operator licences.Rotala buys in the West Midlands & South West Transit 29 June 2007 page 7 The services were slowly rebranded as Wessex Connect, however the majority of the vehicles that Rotala purchased stayed in the blue South Gloucestershire livery and they were gradually disposed of as Rotala were able to replace them. Most of the low floor vehicles from the South Gloucestershire fleet were painted white with dark blue skirts and ended up with staying in Bristol or transferring to Rotala group company Central Connect in Birmingham. Following the sale South Gloucestershire were left with school services, the 462 commuter service and the Axa 101 service, that both interworked with school services. Since then further corporate staff services have been up in and around Bristol as well as work on behalf of UWE, including shuttle bus and P&R; for open days. The fleet has been continually updated since the sale in 2007 with more modern coaches and further second hand buses. All coaches are now white with a new South Gloucestershire fleet name in silver, and school vehicles are gradually being painted into an all over yellow scheme inspired by the purchase of a former Plymouth Citybus school vehicle. The light blue livery is no longer in use as all vehicles have either been sold or painted into the new yellow StudentLink livery. In October 2019, the business was sold to Stagecoach West with 53 vehicles and the depot.Britain's biggest bus and coach operator expanding in Bristol Stagecoach 23 September 2019 National Express In March 2007, South Gloucestershire began operating three weekend journeys on National Express route 040 between Bristol and London, due to increased passenger numbers on this route. In the months leading up to this, the company was providing regular duplicate coaches on route 040 and also other routes such as the 403 from Bath to London and on cross country services from South West England. During December 2007 South Gloucestershire operated the seasonal route 319 from Bristol to Birmingham. The service was introduced to meet demand over the festive period until January 2008. From March 2008 several more additional weekend journeys were added to the 040 and these were operated by South Gloucestershire. In September 2008 South Gloucestershire began operating their first full-time National Express contract on route 200 between Bristol and Gatwick Airport. For this purpose a fleet of six tri-axle Caetano Levante Scania K340EB6s were purchased, the first new coaches to be operated. From January 2010 South Gloucestershire began to operate the 040 on a full-time basis after taking over the route from First Somerset & Avon, who could trace back their history to the start of the service. The majority of journeys on the route were worked by the Levantes purchased for the 200, as well as three further examples acquired from National Express. From 2013 the tri-axle coaches began to lose National Express branding so the use of standard coaches on the 040 is more common. Further expansion came during August when the company took over operation of the 401/2, Wells/Frome to London and 403, Bath to London, which had previously been operated by First Somerset & Avon. A new fleet of 12 Caetano Levante bodied Volvo B9Rs were reacquired for use on both the 200 and 401-3 services, although they were delayed arriving so the fleet used on the 200 service covered on the 403 because they were Low-emission zone compliant. This saw the use of spare coaches on the 200 service for a few weeks until all of the new coaches hadarrived.South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach expands fleet Lombard In May 2011 the Friday and Sunday only service 318 between Bristol and Birmingham was taken on having previously been operated by Applegates Coaches. During August 2011 the operations of Hookways of Meeth collapsed and South Gloucestershire provided emergency cover on routes 339 from Westward Ho! to Grimsby and 502 from Westward Ho! to London. In October the services were taken on, on a permanent basis and four new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante were delivered in May 2012 to allow the upgrade of the routes; January 2012 saw South Gloucestershire begin operating some journeys on route 444 from Gloucester to London, with Whittles covering other runs. This was previously operated by Stagecoach West's Gloucester depot. An outstation was set up in Gloucester and a further 4 new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante delivered for the service. In January 2013 operation of route 444 was transferred to Bennetts Coaches with South Gloucestershire gaining additional journeys on service 403 which were added to the timetable that month. I the same month, South Gloucestershire gained a further National Express contract for route 330 between Penzance and Nottingham after the previous operator, Premiere Travel, went into administration. A former Premiere Travel Levante also joined the fleet. Route 318 was initially reduced to operating on Sundays only from the start of the new National Express timetable commencing on 13 May 2013, with the Friday service not operating after 10 May. However, by 24 May the Friday service on the route had been reinstated. It was however withdrawn again after 11 October 2013 meaning that the route now operates on Sundays only. During the summer of 2013 the company gained further diagrams on the National Express network including the former Yourbus diagram on route 040. This saw South Gloucestershire operate every journey on the route apart from four Friday/Sunday only diagrams which were operated by Chalfont Coaches. Other services introduced included a seasonal 317 service which operated a once daily departure between Bristol and Lymington and a service between London and Leeds Castle. As of September 2013 all of these journeys have now been withdrawn. September also saw South Gloucestershire take on a diagram on service 509 between London and Cardiff which had previously been operated National Express Operations. From November service 302 between Bristol and Northampton has also been taken over from Arriva MK Metro, coincidentally this had previously been operated by FirstGroup. The company acquired further National Express work during summer 2014. Whilst the company's diagrams on route 200 between Bristol and Gatwick were slightly cut back in June 2014, route 337 between Paignton and Rugby was taken over from MK Metro and in July 2014, the company started to operate route 401 between Bristol, Swindon, Heathrow Airport and London. A further service introduced on 31 March 2015 was route 301 between Bristol University and Oxford and operated alongside route 302, providing three journeys a day between Bristol and Oxford. In addition, from June 2015 the company took over Chalfont Coaches' Friday and Sunday workings on service 040 meaning that all journeys on this route were now contracted to South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach. South Gloucestershire had a varied fleet of National Express coaches that included: *1 Scania K114IB4/Irizar PB *6 Scania K340EB4/Caetano Levante *9 Scania K340EB6/Caetano Levante *5 VDL SB4000/Van Hool T9 *20 Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante *4 Volvo B12B/Plaxton Panther South Gloucestershire operated on 12 National Express routes:National Express *040: Bristol to London *200: Bristol to Gatwick Airport via Reading and Heathrow Airport *301: Bristol University to Oxford via Bristol, Bath, Chippenham, Corsham and Swindon *302: Bristol to Northampton via Bath Spa, Swindon and Oxford *318: Bristol to Birmingham via Gloucester and Cheltenham Spa (Sundays only) *330: Penzance to Nottingham *337: Paignton to Rugby *339: Westward Ho! to Grimsby *401: Bristol to London via University of the West of England, Swindon & Heathrow Airport *402: Frome to London via Trowbridge, Newbury & Heathrow Airport *403: Bath to London via Chippenham & Heathrow Airport *502: Barnstaple to London *509: Cardiff to London via Newport On 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire ceased to be a National Express operator with the services to be taken over by Edwards Coaches.Edwards buys Avonmouth depot Route One 20 April 2017 Megabus On 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire commenced operating four Megabus services.Megabus.com Launches Services to Heathrow & Gatwick Airports Megabus 19 April 2017New Airport Routes for Megabus Route One 20 April 2017 *M6a: Barnstaple to London via Taunton, Bristol & Heathrow Airport *M14: Gloucester to London *M25: Cardiff to Gatwick Airport via Heathrow *M38: Barnstaple to Nottingham Bus routes South Gloucestershire's only scheduled bus services is route 462, which runs at peak hour times from Emersons Green, Mangotsfield and Bromley Heath to either Bristol Temple Meads railway station or Clifton via Bristol city centre.Emersons Green - Temple Meads South Gloucestershire Council 18 April 2011 One return diagram operates in each direction between Emersons Green and Clifton Triangle whilst the remaining journeys operate between Emersons Green and Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station. A variant of this route, service 462A was introduced in April 2009 consisting of one return journey in each direction and running between Downend and Bristol Temple Meads on the morning journey and Temple Meads to Emersons Green via Downend and Mangotsfield on the return journey. In April 2011 the morning journey was withdrawn and the evening journey reduced to school days only before eventually being withdrawn altogether. Additionally, South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach previously operated route 680Frampton Cotterell - Filton South Gloucestershire Council 5 September 2011 which runs during term time from Frampton Cotterell to Filton via North and South Yate, Coalpit Heath and University of the West England. This service was also available for use by the general public although the service only operated during term time on college days. The route was taken over by Eurotaxis in September 2014. South Gloucestershire also operate route 101 for Friends Life employees from Stoke Gifford, to Lewin's Mead via the A4174 and M32. This service is not available to the general public.

The Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic () is a specialized type of court which primarily works to protect the people in the Czech Republic against violations of the Constitution by either the legislature, government or by any other subject that violates people's constitutional rights and freedoms. In this respect, it is similar in functionality to the Supreme Court of the United States, but is distinct from the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic. Of all the various levels of the Czech Judiciary it is the one created with the greatest specificity in the constitution. The decisions of the Court are final, cannot be overturned and are considered a source of law, similar to precedents in a common law system.http://www.concourt.cz/clanek/2023 Although the Court itself was established only in 1993, its Czechoslovak predecessor was already provided for in the Constitution of 1920, making Czechoslovakia the first country in the world with a system of judicial review by a specialized court (although the court itself first convened after the Austrian one). It was later adopted by many other countries.Constitutional Court of Austria - History  History and predecessors  = 1848‚Äì1918 = The development of the Czech constitutional tradition went initially hand in hand with that in Austria- Hungary, to which the Czech Crown lands belonged between 1806‚Äì1918. The first attempts to establish a system based on constitution were connected with the 1848 Revolution. A number of constitutions were enacted during the Austrian period (April 1848, March 1849, February 1861 all enacted by the king, December 1867 enacted by the Parliament), however these were far from being democratic and did not include the possibility of judicial review of the acts of the Parliament nor the Habsburg sovereigns. Although the attempt to democratize the Habsburg monarchy failed at the time, it marked the beginning of Czech political activization which ultimately brought about personalities such as Karel Kram√°≈ô or Tom√°≈° Masaryk, who later took part in the establishment of the First Czechoslovak Republic and its constitutional tradition. = 1918‚Äì1948 = Following the establishment of Czechoslovakia, the Interim Constitution was passed in November 1918 (Act No. 37/1918 Coll.), which did not yet establish the Constitutional court. Meanwhile, the works on the Czechoslovak constitution were at full pace. The new constitution was influenced by the following models: * 1867 Austrian constitution in the sphere of civil rights, * 1787 constitution of the USA in the sphere of judiciary and checks and balances, * 1875 French constitution in the sphere of the powers of the president and the parliament, * the Swiss constitution in the sphere of the powers of the government. The new constitution was further influenced by the Czech humanist tradition (Jan Hus, Petr Chelƒçick√Ω, Jan Amos Komensk√Ω, Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, Franti≈°ek Rieger, Tom√°≈° Masaryk) as well as the peace conferences which took place after the first world war. Karel Baxa, Chief Justice 1921-1931 The new constitution was accepted on 2 February 1920 as Act No. 121/1920 Coll. With this constitution Czechoslovakia became the first country in the world to adopt a system where a review of acts of the national parliament's constitutionality was possible by a special court - the Constitutional Court (while in USA and Australia this power was vested in the hands of their Supreme Courts already before and the Austrian Constitutional Court already had the power to examine laws of the States of Austria in 1919Court of Austria - History). Later, a similar system of judicial review on national level was adopted by Austria (1920) which came into force before the Czechoslovak Constitutional Court took up its duties. It later became generally known as the Austrian System, being taken over by many other countries e.g. Liechtenstein (1925), Greece (1927), Spain (1931), Ireland (1937) etc. The Constitutional Court of Czechoslovakia itself came into existence in the assembly hall of the presidium of the Council of Ministers at Prague Castle on 17 November 1921. The Constitutional Court had the jurisdiction to decide about constitutionality of the enactments of the Republic, of Assembly of the Carpathian Ruthenia (this was only theoretical, as the presumption of its autonomy was not reached until 1938) and of legal measures of Permanent Committee (which consisted of 16 members of the Chamber of the Deputies and 8 Senators and took action in urgent cases when the Parliament was not in session). The motions for review of enactments could be brought by the Supreme Court, Supreme Administrative Court, Chamber of Deputies, Senate and the Assembly of the Carpathian Ruthenia, while the legal measures of the Permanent Committee were subject to automatic review immediately after being passed. Unlike today, the Court did not have the jurisdiction to hear citizens' individual petitions. The Court was active in the period of 1921‚Äì1931, when it reviewed a number of legal measures of the Permanent Committee, however no motions for review of enactments were ever brought before it. Although the legal basis for the Court and its jurisdiction remained unchanged, it was vacant and inactive between 1932‚Äì1937. The Chief Justice for the period of 1938-1939 was Jaroslav Krejƒç√≠. Although the Constitution remained in force during the German Nazi occupation and after the war, the rights it was providing for became only theoretical and the Constitutional Court had not convened during and after the second world war. = 1948‚Äì1989 = Due to extermination of a large number of Czechoslovakian elites by the Nazi Germans, disillusion with the Western countries following the Munich Agreement and high influence of the Soviet Union, which liberated almost whole of the country, the post-war era may be characterized by the growing influence of the communists, which culminated in February 1948 Communist coup. A new constitution was adopted in May 1948. It was essentially a 1920 constitution modified by socialist ideas in order to serve the ideology of the communist party. For example, the list of fundamental rights was extended to cover also social and cultural rights, but on the other hand the right of a private ownership was limited. Formally, the constitution was democratic and influenced by the idea of \\"People's Democracy\\". In reality, however, democracy was curbed with the communist party controlling the state and the fundamental rights not being observed by the authorities. The 1948 constitution did not adopt the Constitutional Court. Another constitution was adopted in 1960, being influenced mostly by the Soviet constitution of 1936. It legally established the \\"leading role\\" of the communist party, declared Marxism-Leninism as the state's leading ideology, removed the division of power. This constitution was to a large degree modified in 1968, establishing Czech and Slovak Socialist Republics within the Czechoslovakia as a federative socialist state. The 1968 constitution re-introduced the Constitutional Court, or in fact three of them - one for the Federation and two for the Republics. The Federal Constitutional Court was to have a jurisdiction over constitutionality of federal enactments and disputes over competencies between the Federation and the Republics. The Constitution anticipated adoption of an enactment dealing in detail with Constitutional Court, but that did not happen until 1991, precluding the factual establishment of the Court. Officially the need for the Court had not arisen as the presumed disputes over competencies between the Federation and the Republics never took place. = 1989‚Äì1992 = The first changes to the Constitution took place already during the Velvet Revolution. On 30 November 1989, the leading role of the communist party was abolished as well as mentioning of the Marxism-Leninism. A number of other novelizations led to democratization of the constitution. In 1991 the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted as a part of the Constitutional order, which was followed by an implementing enactment dealing with the Constitutional Court, as presumed by the 1968 constitution. The Constitutional Court of Czechoslovakia was thus re-established, although only for a brief period of time in 1992 before the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The dissolution itself was actually carried out by a constitutional act (No. 542/1992 Coll.). = Since 1992 = On 16 December 1992 a new Constitution (Act No. 1/1993 Coll.) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms (Act No. 2/1993 Coll.) were adopted. Article 83-89 of the Constitution established the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, the processes of which are further elaborated in Act No. 182/1993 Coll..  Jurisdiction  Hall for plenary sessions (formerly hall of the Moravian Parliament) right The major part of the court's workload consists of individual petitions of citizen's alleged violations of their constitutional rights after all other remedies were exhausted (including appeals to the Supreme Court or the Supreme Administrative Court). According to Article 87 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court shall rule on: * repeal of laws or individual provisions thereof should they contravene the constitutional order, * repeal of other legal regulations or individual provisions thereof should they contravene the constitutional order or the law, * constitutional complaints filed by territorial self-government bodies against illegal interventions by the State, * constitutional complaints filed against final decisions and other interventions by agencies of public authority, violating constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms, * appeals against decisions in matters of confirmation of the election of a Deputy or Senator, * reservations on loss of eligibility and on incompatibility of holding the office of Deputy or Senator according to Article 25, * impeachment by the Senate of the President of the Republic under Article 65, par. 2, * the Presidential proposal to repeal a decision of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate according to Article 66 (decision on execution of selected presidential duties being handed over to the Prime Minister in case of President's inability to execute them himself for a serious reason), * measures essential for the implementation of a ruling by an international court, which is binding for the Czech Republic, unless it can be implemented in a different manner, * whether a decision on the dissolution of a political party, or another decision regarding the activity of a political party, conforms to constitutional or other laws, * disputes regarding the scope of the jurisdiction of state agencies and territorial self-government agencies, unless such disputes are under the jurisdiction of a different body, * on the remedy against a decision adopted by the President of the Republic not to announce a referendum concerning the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, on whether the procedure of the referendum concerning the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union is in accordance with the Constitutional Act on Referendum concerning the Accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union and the implementing regulation related thereto. Also, in cases when an already abolished law contrary to the constitutional order should be applied by a general court, it shall submit the issue to the Constitutional Court (Art. 95 par. 2).  Composition  The Court is composed of 15 justices who are named for a renewable period of 10 years by the President subject to the Senate's approval. The justices enjoy criminal immunity and may be prosecuted only subject to the approval of the Senate. The plenum of the court is quorate when at least 10 justices are present. A majority of at least 9 justices must be reached in order to repeal a law, to impeach the President or to adopt a legal opinion differentiating from one previously held. Other matters are decided by senates consisting of three justices.

Early life Turner was born at Newport, Rhode Island, the son of James Varnum Turner and Catherine (Greene) Turner. Civil War service During his adult life, Turner was a dentist before the outbreak of the American Civil War. He enlisted as a sergeant in Company K of the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry on June 5, 1861. Coincidentally, Company K was commanded by his brother, Captain Charles W. Turner, who had previously been commander of the Newport Artillery Company. On July 22 he was then commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant to fill a vacancy resulting from a casualty during the Battle of Bull Run which was fought the day before. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on November 28, 1861 to fill a vacancy created by his brother's resignation from the Army.Official register of Rhode Island officers and soldiers who served in the United States Army and Navy from 1861 to 1865. Published by order of the General Assembly of Rhode Island, January session, 1866. pg. 86. Turner was promoted to captain in command of Company G of the 2nd Rhode Island on April 4, 1863. Shortly after assuming command of G Company, he was wounded on May 3 at the Battle of Salem Church, Virginia during the Chancellorsville Campaign. On May 11, he sent to his brother Dr. Henry E. Turner (1816-1897), who was serving as a contract surgeon at Fort Adams, a short telegram - \\"Wounded in front of bladder. Pocket book saved my life. Not serious.\\" http://newport.toursphere.com/en/william-green-turner-29828.html On account of his wounds, Captain Turner was discharged from the Army on July 21, 1863. He was subsequently sent by his family to Italy, since it was assumed the climate would improve his health. Artistic career In Italy, Turner became immediately enamored of the works of the Italian Renaissance sculptors and especially those in Florence, where he was lodging. Turner (under the sponsorship of his uncle William Greene of East Greenwich, R.I.) chose to remain in Florence for the next thirty years taking a studio there. He took numerous commissions both from private sources and from the newly formed Italian government. Both the Redwood Library and the Newport Historical Society have examples of his work in marble and alabaster. He became (as was often the fashion of the day), an American expatriate choosing to study and master his art abroad. His works were shown in Rome and Paris at various expositions during the 1870s and 1880s. Among the more famous of Turner's American works is his bronze Oliver Perry Monument, which was unveiled on 10 September 1885 at the Parade (now known as Eisenhower Park) on Washington Square in Newport, Rhode Island. In 1890 Turner was elected as an honorary member of the Rhode Island Society of the Cincinnati. During the second decade of the twentieth century, William Greene Turner moved home to Newport from Italy and spent his remaining days doing commissions in the United States. His bust of his brother, famed Newport horticulturist Doctor Henry E. Turner, is among the possessions of the Newport Historical Society. Personal life William Greene Turner never married. He died in 1917 and is buried in the Island Cemetery in Newport.

The A131 autoroute cuts through the middle of the commune alongside the banks of the Tancarville canal. The economy depends mainly on the industrial area of the Port of the Lower-Seine (chemical works and refineries) and the commercial area known as Camp-Dolent. History The etymology of the first part of the name is Gunfridr's farm, a Scandinavian farmer who probably settled in the 10th century. The Orcher suffix comes from the name of the first seigneurs of the village, now corrupted to Orcher, but originally Aurichier (alor = alder and kjarr / ker = marsh. Cf. Ellerker, Yorkshire), that took themselves in turn their name from the same place, where the chateau is located. The commune was created and recorded in 1251 with the merger of the two parishes of Gonfreville and Gournay.

Translated into English, Purunagada means Old Fort, which it was during the rule of the kings. The moat has now been made into a canal, which divides Purunagada from the rest of the town. Being placed at the foot hills, in the warm embrace of Nakti Dangar one can have a beautiful view of the entire town from Purunagada, particularly in the evenings. Purunagada boasts of its ancient, beautiful and serene temples, and can be called the Temple-street of Jeypore. Some of the temples at Purunagoda are: Neelakantheswara,Dakshyina kali ,Dangar Dei,Ganesh, Radha Krushna and Jagannath (inside the Neelakanteswar) Ayyappa, Ganga Maa, Bhairabi Bala Gopal and Saniswar One of the unique features of Purunagada is the Rath Yatra which is held same of gundicha jatra of Puri in other hand the main ratha jatra of jeypore is held on the next day.  People  People belonging to different caste, creed and religion have been living in Purunagada and most of them have been staying here for generations. Tribals Parajas form an integral part of this part of the town and were earlier known for their hunting skills, clean houses, robust physique, unique traditions and hard work. With exposure to the urban way of life, their dependence on the forests has been declining and has eroded their culture and heritage.  Parajas  Paraja is a tribe found in the southern part of Orissa and some other parts of the Dandakaranya region. Their appearance is different from the other tribes (without the aborigines features) and have a distinct appearance and lifestyle. Their skin colour can vary from fair (cream) to ebony black. Hair strands are normally straight. Eyes are sunken deeper but not as hollow as other tribes. The average height of the Parajas is around 1.6 m. Parajas have a very rigid societal structure and do not eat at even Brahmin households. With time, this has become a forgotten practice and many tribals now do not even know about such rituals.  The temples of Purunagada  = Dangar Dei = Dedicated to the local goddess said to be an incarnation of Maa Durga, this temple attracts people far and wide for the belief that wishes come true here. This temple belongs to the tribals of the Paraja Tribe and the priest (the most famous being Jaani himself is a tribal. But people of all beliefs come to seek answers and blessings of Maa Dongar Dei. Saddled on a small hillock belonging to the famous Nakti Dangar, the temple was once surrounded by the very famous and rarely found Hathijhula ( Hathi - Elephant; Jhula - swing) trees. The branches - like very thick strong ropes - of these trees were huge and long, intertwined so densely that their origins and endings could not be identified easily. Folklore says that these branches could even support huge loads equaling the weight of an elephant without snapping. Now only a few of these trees remain to be seen. Dongar Devi temple, like many other temples dedicated to Goddesses, is witness to regular animal sacrifice, mostly fowls. This owes to the belief that when someone has a fervent wish, one must be prepared to give something precious too. Tribals come to this temple even to find a cure to their diseases, for better agricultural yields, rains, money, etc. Many affluent families of the undivided Koraput district also visit this temple to sort out their problems and seek the blessings of Mother Dongar Devi. = Neelakantheswara Temple = The Neelakantheswara Temple is the oldest temple in Purunagoda and Jeypore. The NKT road owes its name to this temple, which has become synonymous with Purunagoda. The temple also has a Jagannath temple and a very rare Radha Krishna temple within the premises. The Neelakantheswara Temple was discovered by a woodcutter who accidentally hit on the Shiva Linga. The mark could still be seen today. = Daksinakali = Contrary to popular belief that Dakshin refers to the direction South, Dakshin in Daksinakali refers to the 'right side', because of the idol of Goddess Kali has her right leg on Lord Shiva. This ancient temple stands for the royal connection of Purunagarh, being the ancestral Goddess (Istadevi) of the kings of Jeypore. Dense trees fill the temple premises with peace and tranquility, and an eerie silence could be felt in the temple even during the day time. Huge drums belonging to the past era and magnificent, larger-than-life paintings adorning the walls of the sanctum on all sides, make visiting this temple a daunting task for the weak hearted and people with the slightest of guilt. The temple is famous far and wide with people thronging to this place in huge numbers, particularly during the ritualistic Dussehra. Innumerable tales about the fiery nature of the Goddess, her bent head, animal sacrifice, punishments doled out to the sinners, of her relationship with the priests, the royal family and the people are abound regarding this temple. = Ganga Maa Temple = One of the few temples found dedicated to Goddess Ganga. It is here that the ritualistic Ghanta Paraba - a festival similar to Bonalu where a representation of each goddess of a particular locality is taken in a clay pot to other parts to be worshiped - begins at Purunagoda. The procession begins only after a flower drops from the Goddess' head. Though debilitated and deserted for most part of the year, this temple and the festival is the essence of Purunagoda's tradition.

Atilius came from a prominent family of consuls for four generations; the family originally hailed from southern Italy. Family Atilius was a younger son of the Roman hero Marcus Atilius Regulus, the consul captured during the First Punic War, and grandson of another Marcus Atilius Regulus. His elder brother, Marcus Atilius Regulus, was Roman consul for the year 227 BC, together with Publius Valerius Flaccus, and consul suffectus for 217 replacing Gaius Flaminius and later censor. An uncle of the same name was also twice consul during the First Punic War.William Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, 1870, \\"G. Atilius M. f. M. n. Regulus\\" Atilius' father Marcus Atilius Regulus died by 255 in the failed invasion of Africa. Another version, debated subsequently by historians moves his death to 250 after an act of great self-sacrifice (most believe Roman accounts of his self-sacrifice and barbaric death to be invention and propaganda). His mother Marcia allegedly tortured two Punic prisoners to death in revenge. According to Livy, he had at least two surviving sons and one surviving daughter when he returned to Carthage. Military career Atilius was elected consul in 225 as the plebeian consul with the patrician Lucius Aemilius Papus, and was sent to quell a revolt in Sardinia which he quickly accomplished. He then returned to the Italian mainland to fight the Gauls, and fell in the Battle of Telamon. Battle of Telamon After hearing about the Celtic (or Gaulish) invasion of Etruria, the consul returned hastily to engage in battle. Atilius decided to engage the Gauls on his own. By being the first to engage in battle, he hoped to get the larger share of the credit of the victory. However, his plans went awry when the Roman cavalry encountered the more experienced Celtic cavalry and was cut to pieces. According to Polybius > Just at this time, Gaius Atilius, the other Consul, had reached Pisa from > Sardinia with his legions and was on his way to Rome, marching in the > opposite direction to the enemy. When the Celts were near Telamon in > Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and > were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that > had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, > stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news > surprised him but at the same time made him very hopeful, as he thought he > had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his > Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at > marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in > line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which > the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full > speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival > and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get > the largest share of credit for the result.Polybius, Histories, 2.27 > At first the battle was confined to the hill, all the armies gazing on it, > so great were the numbers of cavalry from each host combating there pell- > mell. In this action Gaius the Consul fell in the melee fighting with > desperate courage, and his head was brought to the Celtic kings; but the > Roman cavalry, after a stubborn struggle, at length overmastered the enemy > and gained possession of the hill.Polybius, Histories, 2.28 Atilius' death did not dismay his officers who continued the battle without him and won possession of the hill. However, the Roman victory was due to the Gaulish decision to face the battle both ways (according to historian Aryeh Nusbacher) and thus divide their energies. The surviving consul Lucius Aemilius Papus obtained sole credit for the victory, and was awarded a triumph. It is not known if Atilius was married or left any surviving issue. No Atilii Reguli appear in subsequent histories. References Sources *Livy, History of Rome, Rev. Canon Roberts (translator), Ernest Rhys (Ed.); (1905) London: J. M.

Company law In company law, there are three main areas that regulate mergers and acquisitions (also, reconstructions or takeovers). There are three main areas of law, those to do with schemes of arrangement overseen by a court, those for general reconstructions, demergers, amalgamations and so on that are not overseen by a court, and takeovers, which concern acquisitions of public companies. =Scheme of arrangement= *Insolvency Act 1986, ss.110‚Äì111, on schemes of arrangement or reconstructions *Bisgood v.

In the City of London, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, established in 1968, oversees Companies Act duties, including those laid down in the European Directive on Takeover Bids (2004/25/EC) for public companies. Under the Companies Act 2006, s.979 gives a takeover bidder who has already acquired 90% of a company's shares the right to compulsorily buy out the remaining shareholders (squeeze out). Conversely, s.983 allows minority shareholders to insist their stakes are bought out. The rules come under Part 28 of the Act. More generally, the City Code on Takeovers and MergersText of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (also called \\"City Code\\" or \\"Takeover Code\\") lays down rules for a takeover, found in the so-called Blue Book. The Code used to be a non-statutory set of rules that was controlled by City institutions on a theoretically voluntary basis. However, as a breach of the Code brought such reputational damage and the possibility of exclusion from City services run by those institutions, it was regarded as binding. In 2006, the Code was put onto a statutory footing as part of the UK's compliance with the European Directive on Takeovers.European Directive on Takeovers (2004/25/EC) The Code requires that all shareholders in a company should be treated equally, regulates when and what information companies must and cannot release publicly in relation to the bid, sets timetables for certain aspects of the bid, and sets minimum bid levels following a previous purchase of shares. In particular: * a shareholder must make an offer when its shareholding, including that of parties acting in concert (a \\"concert party\\"), reaches 30% of the target (\\"mandatory bid rule\\"); * information relating to the bid must not be released except by announcements regulated by the Code; * the bidder must make an announcement if rumour or speculation have affected a company's share price; * the level of the offer must not be less than any price paid by the bidder in the twelve months before the announcement of a firm intention to make an offer; * if shares are bought during the offer period at a price higher than the offer price, the offer must be increased to that price; The Rules Governing the Substantial Acquisition of Shares, which used to accompany the Code and which regulated the announcement of certain levels of shareholdings, have now been abolished,see the Takeover Panel's statement in 2006 because it was viewed to be unnecessarily restrictive of shares between 15% and 29.9% of a company's voting rights. Labour law The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations came into force in 1981 and implement a European Directive on takeovers. Competition law UK law on merger control follows European Union law. The competence to deal with issues that only affect the UK market falls under the OFT and Competition Commission's jurisdiction. These two institutions are influential players in the development of European merger law. The term under EC law for merger is \\"concentration\\", which exists when a... > \\"change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or > more previously independent undertakings... (b) the acquisition... if direct > or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other > undertakings.\\" Art. 3(1), Regulation 139/2004, the European Community Merger > Regulation This usually means that one firm buys out the shares of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ex ante prevention of creating dominant firms. In the case of [T-102/96] Gencor Ltd v. Commission [1999] ECR II-753 the EU Court of First Instance wrote merger control is there \\"to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions\\". What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions.see, for instance para 17, Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers (2004/C 31/03) Something called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to calculate the \\"density\\" of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market.C-68/94 France v. Commission [1998] ECR I-1375, para. 219 A further problem of collective dominance, or oligopoly through \\"economic links\\"Italian Flat Glass [1992] ECR ii-1403 can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to collusion. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can coordinate their behaviour more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers.T-342/99 Airtours plc v. Commission [2002] ECR II-2585, para 62 The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.Mannesmann, Vallourec and Ilva [1994] CMLR 529, OJ L102 21 April 1994 See also *UK competition law *UK labour law *UK company law Notes References ;Books *Len Sealy and Sarah Worthington (2007) Cases and Materials in Company law, 8th Ed., Oxford University Press *PL Davies (2008) Gower's Modern Company Law, 8th Ed., Sweet and Maxwell * Hugh Collins, Keith Ewing, Aileen McColgan, Labour Law, Text, Cases and Materials (2005) Hart Publishing * Simon Deakin, Gillian Morris, Labour Law (2004) Hart Publishing * Jones, Alison and Sufrin, Brenda (2005) EC Competition Law: Text, Cases and Materials, Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed. * Whish, Richard (2003) Competition Law, 5th Ed.

It was renamed in 1954 as the Royal Academy of Colonial Sciences (Acad√©mie royale des sciences coloniales). Its interests were initially restricted to the Belgian colonial empire and particularly the Belgian Congo until decolonisation. In 1959, it was renamed the Royal Academy of Overseas Sciences (Acad√©mie royale des sciences d'outre-mer) and broadened its geographical remit to include Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania. The academy organises a wide range of activities, including publications, academic conferences, and annual competititions. The Royal Academy for Overseas Sciences is divided into three Sections: * Section of Human Sciences * Section of Natural and Medical Sciences * Section of Technical Sciences Competitions, scholarships and prizes The Academy organizes yearly competitions with specific topics for each of its three Sections. Scholarships are also granted every year as part of the Fund, which aim is to contribute to the training of future agricultural engineers or veterinary surgeons by giving them the opportunity to go for a training period in a developing country.

He was the son of Emmett Kelly Sr., who was a legendary circus clown. Kelly Jr. copied his father's style.  Early life  Kelly was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee on the day the John Robinson Circus, his father's employer, was doing its last show. Kelly Jr. spent his first few years traveling with his parents. When he reached school age he still traveled with his family during the summer and lived with his grandparents when school was in session. He finished school during World War II, and joined the Navy at age 18 and spent approximately three years in the Pacific participating in major operations in Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Despite being raised around the circus, he pursued a career in the railroad business after the war, becoming a switch tender and also a mechanic.  Career  It was not until 1960 (four years after his father retired from performing) when Kelly Jr., who had never been encouraged by his father, debuted himself as \\"Weary Willie\\" at the Circus Festival in Peru, Indiana. He was guided by their manager, Leonard Green, for the next four years. He toured a daredevil auto show called \\"Austin's Motor Derby\\" during the night and would arrive just hours before the next show. In 1963, Kelly was the featured performer of the Hagen-Wallace Circus as they traveled nationwide. The elder Kelly was not happy with his son's decision to play an almost identical character, although the latter claimed his version of Weary Willie was less sad, and the two were estranged for years. While traveling to a Kodak performance in San Diego, California, Kelly drove to Tombstone, Arizona on a sightseeing detour. He said he had four days to get to San Diego and he was well ahead of schedule so he wanted to see Tombstone. He fell in love with the town and decided to retire there. Kelly would snowbird each year in Tombstone until he moved there in 1980. It was then that he joined the Arizona Rangers and the Tombstone Company. In 1972, Kelly, with help from his manager, established his own circus which toured nationally and was the only circus to perform at the White House, not just once but twice‚Äîonce in 1972 and again in 1973 during the annual White House Easter Egg Roll. Throughout his life, Kelly donated his time to several charities including The Make A Wish Foundation, The American Cancer Society, Save The Children Foundation, and FACES‚ÄîThe National Association for the Craniofacially Handicapped and was honored by Presidents, First Ladies, Kings and Queens, and numerous heads of state. A weekend event in Tombstone, Arizona was named after him. Emmett Kelly Jr. Days, which is held in November, includes clown school and other events. It is done to raise funds for a scholarship for a Tombstone High School graduate. Kelly continued to perform until he retired from clowning on his 81st birthday in 2004. On his last birthday he requested to retrieve his Ranger Badge. He died 16 days later. The badge was presented to his daughter by LTC Lathan Varnado, State Adjutant. In a gold framed case, Mrs. Kelly-Knapp was presented an Arizona Ranger Patch flanked on the left by a Ranger Badge and a Ranger Belt Buckle on the right. Also lying on the field of blue felt was a plaque inscribed \\"Emmett Kelly Jr., Arizona Rangers, Tombstone Company, 1982, Badge # 405.\\" Since he worked for the railroad, Kelly's hobbies outside of the circus included collecting model trains which later inspired him to create the Emmett Kelly Jr. Circus Train collection. He was also a race car enthusiast.  Personal life  After his discharge from the military, he married and raised five children. He worked at a variety of jobs, in various locations, before settling down in Peru, Ind. He worked as a brakeman with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, struggling on $134 every two weeks. Kelly continued touring, despite his wife's pleas. Their marriage eventually ended in a divorce in the '60s. His wife said that his character Willie had taken over her husband. Not long after he went on the road with Willie, his son, Paul Anthony Kelly, lost a leg in a train accident. Kelly Jr. heard of the accident and came home, but after a brief visit departed, saying \\"Willie‚Äôs got itchy feet.\\"  Death  Kelly died from pneumonia on Wednesday, November 29, 2006, in Sierra Vista, Arizona at the Sierra Vista Regional Health Center which is near his home in Tombstone, Arizona, according to his daughter. His family, friends, and The Arizona Rangers were at his bedside when, at 3:05 p.m. (MST), he died. He was 82. He was buried with full military honors provided by a Navy Color Guard. He is buried in Southern Arizona Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Sierra Vista, Cochise County, Arizona.

History The castle was built approximately in the first part of the 13th century, but archaeological finds suggest that the area around Buchlov castle was settled in the oldest periods of civilization. The function of the castle was defensive, agricultural and administrative as well. The first form of the castle had a similar ground-plan as buildings of that era. It was created by two massive prismatic towers situated on opposite parts of a rocky plateau. A high palace on the southern part of the yard was built at the same time and it was surrounded by a wall. The second construction period occurred in the 1370s. Another tower was built and on the second floor of this tower there was a chapel that held the most valuable objects of early Gothic architecture of the day. There is an opinion that a model for this chapel was one of French royal chapels. Unfortunately, during later capturing of Buchlov Castle by armies of Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus in the second half of the 15th century, the chapel was destroyed to the point that it was abandoned. It was replaced by two large rooms serving as store and depository. And although the castle was a permanent possession of a king until the 16th century, it was often given in pawn to aristocratic clans. Nobles of Cimburk owned it at the end of the 15th century. At that time a representative chivalric hall was built. In the year 1511 the castle was given to a private holder, and from the 16th to 18th century various Moravian clans changed its ownership. The most important were the nobles of ≈Ωerot√≠n, Z√°st≈ôizl and Pet≈ôvald. Constructional work continued in Renaissance style. Some parts of the castle were added in baroque style. However, in 1701, the Buchlovice Castle was finished and in 1751 the owners, the Berchtold noble family, occupied it for more than two centuries. A family museum was built in the castle thanks to the brothers Leopold Berchtold and Bed≈ôich Berchtold. Leopold Berchtold, who was foreign minister of Austria-Hungary at the beginning of World War I. He was buried at Buchlau after his death in November 1942. In 1945, after the end of World War II, the castle was confiscated on the bases of Bene≈° decrees and became property of the Czechoslovak state. Later it was added to the list of national cultural monuments. Nowadays it is open to public, and many cultural programs are held each year. =Saint Barbara‚Äôs Chapel= Saint Barbara‚Äôs Chapel also called Barborka came into existence in the 13th century, and it was used as a funeral crypt for holders of a manor of Buchlov. Later it was rebuilt and finished in the year 1672. It is built in early baroque style on a cruciform plan with a central cupola. It is one kilometer away from Buchlov castle. Pilgrimage divine services are held to this day. Resources * ≈Ωi≈ælavsk√Ω, Bo≈ôek (2006), Buchlov: historie a p≈ô√≠bƒõhy hradu.

The village is located miles northwest of the town of Stowmarket,Suffolk Directorys - Suffolk Record Office overlooking the Gipping valley, next to the A14 corridor. The population recorded in 2011 was 1,638. Mentioned in the Domesday Book, it was the site of a castle, a church on the pilgrim's route to Bury St Edmunds Abbey, and a market. Adjacent farms on the north side of the village were also home to one of the first studies of organic farming and the first headquarters of the Soil Association.

Leofgifu bequeathed Haughley to her only daughter who may eventually have become the wife of Guthmund, the holder of Haughley in 1066 (Guthmund was the brother of Wulfric, 'a kinsman' of Edward the Confessor, appointed Bishop of Ely c. 1052-63). Haughley is mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086 as Hagala being held by Hugh de Montfort, having formerly been held by the Saxon lord Guthmund for Edward. A medieval market town and site of a royal fortress, Haughley prospered till the Tudor period then went into decline further compounded by a fire started on 11 April 1709 at which it is said ‚Äúlike a phoenix Stowmarket rose from its ashes‚Äù. The parish anciently divided into the four divisions of Haughley Green, Old Street, New Street and Tothill.Parish History: Haughley, Suffolk County Council. Accessed: 7 December 2017. The original 120 acres of Haughley Green, north of the main village, were enclosed in 1854, after being bisected by the railway from Ipswich to Bury St Edmunds which opened in 1846. Through the Victorian period to the present day the village has grown and was connected to water and sewerage with the addition of local authority housing at the instigation of the infamous and controversial Rev Walter Grainge White in the 1920s following the description of Haughley and its open sewers by the Daily Mail in 1928 as ‚Äúthe fever pit of the kingdom‚Äù. Buildings Signpost in Haughley =Castle= Haughley Castle is considered one of the best preserved motte and bailey earthworks in Suffolk. The castle was built by Hugh de Montfort following the conquest of 1066 over the previous footprint of the fortified hall of the Saxon lord Guthmund,Suffolk Archaeological Service Survey - Haughley School 1999 killed at the Battle of Hastings. King Henry II entrusted the castle to Ranulf de Broc (who had a part in the murder of Thomas Becket). In the Revolt of 1173‚Äì74 by Henry II's sons against their father, Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, captured the castle for the rebels and demolished it in October 1173 following a short and fierce battle by smoking the occupants out of the keep by piling brushwood against the building. The dead were buried in a mass grave to the east of the castle site.* \\"Manor of Haughley\\" in Copinger, W. A. (1910) The Manors of Suffolk: Notes on Their History and Devolution.

During the later 1300s it was occupied by Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk (granted the Manor in 1337) before falling into disuse in the 15th century when the De La Poles built Wingfield Castle. Haughley Park mansion was built in the early 17th century in what was then royal hunting park of the Castle. The castle motte is wide at the base and tall. The bailey is rectangular, by across, with the entrance on the west side. The outer bailey exists in earthworks around the village called The Folly which are part of the prehistoric and Iron Age statements of the village.

It is dedicated to the \\"Assumption of the Virgin Mary\\" and a fair was held annually in August to celebrate this until its abolition in 1871. The first recorded priest was an Italian, John de Monte Luelli, in the early 13th century. The church was endowed to Hailes Abbey by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall and \\"King of the Romans\\" (1257-1272) in thanks to God for his survival at sea.Haighley Parish Magazine, October 2015, p.1 Prior to the reformation the church was on the \\"Pilgrims Way\\" to the Shrine of St Edmund at Bury St Edmunds Abbey. Visitors would worship at the Chapel of the Holy Cross in Haughley which contained a piece of the true cross of Christ in return for a papal remission of their sins.MacCulloch, p.30 It remained under the patronage of Hailes Abbey until 1537 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The church contains many memorials and hatchments to the Ray, Crawford, Smythe and Ward families as well as remains of medieval stained glass and a fine carved roof. The south tower (c. 1330) contains five bells dating back to the medieval period. The most recent church clock was erected in 1903, a gift of the Bevan family. Previous clocks had been erected from 1697 onwards replacing a public sundial removed by the Woods family. The flagpole on the church tower was erected and gifted by the Palmer family in 2002 to mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The current vicar is the Rev Brin Singleton. A United Reformed Church chapel formerly worshipped regularly in the village and now works closely with the Church of England in Haughley. =Other prominent buildings= Old Street, HaughleyIn and around Haughley are many thatched, painted and listed buildings; these include: *Haughley Park mansion (a Grade I listed building), built in the 17th century (c. 1620) for the Sulyard family (replacing their house at nearby Wetherden) following service to Queen Mary I. After a devastating fire in 1961 during its restoration, it has been the home of the Williams family since the mid 1960s. The Barn and grounds are used for conferences and weddings. *Antrim House and the Old Counting House (a Grade II* Listed Building), dating back to the 14th century. It is described as ‚Äúthe stall‚Äù within its deeds and contains a rare triple arched medieval shop front. The part of the building containing the restaurant was the general store for 300 years until the early 1980s before conversion to a restaurant. *Chilton and Mulbra House (a Grade II Listed Building), formerly the Guildhall (though its construction appears to post- date the dissolution of the guilds in 1545) with an impressive queen post roof and a painting of St Blaise *Dial Farmhouse (c. 1550; a Grade II Listed Building) has a carved porch believed to be from the village of Mendlesham depicting deer and Tudor roses *New Bells Farmhouse (a Grade II Listed Building), a Tudor moated farm (c. 1530) and possibly once a Dane settlement.Page 10 Notes and Transcripts of Haughley by Rev Nigel McCullouch - Suffolk Record Office The farm was also one of the sites used in the organic farming study, the Haughley Experiment, from 1939. Nearby Walnut Tree Manor was from 1946 to 1985 headquarters of the Soil Association. *The White House known locally as ‚ÄúThe Ark‚Äù (a Grade II Listed Building) overlooking the village green, formerly Crown Hall, was built in 1527 by charter of Henry VIII for Roger Bell, a close friend of the King and \\"Yeoman of the Keeper of the Kings Cellar\\".MacCulloch, p.29 It is reputed that the house was built from smuggled sales of wool out of England and silks into England. The grounds with its orchards and residence are within the site of the outer bailey of Haughley Castle and of the original Iron Age and Prehistoric settlements of the village. The front was remodelled in the Georgian style in the 1850s and it was prior to that it was the home of John Ebden, a surgeon and veteran of the American War of Independence, and of the Rev Samuel Christmas Browne, author of Trinity College, Dublin when it was known as the Gipping & Shelland Parsonage whose advowson was in the gift of the Tyrell family until 1892. The Maltings within the grounds were sold to become a Village Hall in 1907. Since then it has been the residence of the Palmer family for the past six generations and whom have been resident in Haughley since Tudor times and who are Lords of the Manor of Eye and Constable of Eye Castle.History of The White House 2010 page 1 & 2- by L.

He was succeeded by Alfred Woods (from 1896 to 1936) then the Edwards family. Additionally the village has a veterinary surgeons, a Co-op store, hairdressers, second-hand furniture shop and an Indian restaurant.

Crawford's School, Haughley - geograph.org.uk - 321973 Haughley Crawford's Primary School is situated adjacent to the church (it takes its name from William Henry Crawford, a rich clergyman and owner of Haughley Park in the mid 19th century who left charitable bequests in his will). In the 1950s a RAF Meteor jet fighter clipped the school before crash landing in the field beyond killing the pilot Peter Phillips - believed to have sacrificed his life to save the children of the school in a direct hit. Hillcroft Preparatory School, an independent school, was located at Walnut Tree Manor in Haughley Green from 1911 until 2007, when it merged with the Finborough School. Palmers Bakery Palmers Bakery is one of the oldest bakeries in the country, first established around 1750 and run by the Palmer family since 1869. The bakery uses 200-year- old brick ovens to bake its bread in the medieval bake house, situated on the site of market place stalls described within its deeds as being \\"two stalls beneath the market place of Hawley next the house of John Bloom the younger that has long since wasted\\"; this title predates the Norman conquest and can be traced to the time of the Saxon King Edgar. A bakehouse in Haughley market place was owned by Gilbert and Joan Iryng in 1362, in the reign of Edward III. The present building dates from 1650 with additions; it also houses the Cold War era civil defence nuclear air attack siren and power generators. William James Palmer purchased the business in 1869 (the Palmer family is descended from the family of Roger Palmer, 1st Earl of Castlemaine and husband of Barbara Villiers, mistress of Charles II).History of Haughley - a countryside parish page 56 He was a staunch Liberal, Atheist, Republican and follower of Thomas Paine and of the National Secular Society. He campaigned nationally for the rights of agricultural workers through the foundation of the National Agricultural Labourers Union. He was a friend of Sir Joseph Arch and a friend and advocate of Charles Bradlaugh. At his death in 1915 he was described by Bradlaugh's daughter and campaigner as \\"never a truer, loyal friend and advocate of my father and his beliefs through the persecution and personal loss he suffered\\"; his wife and daughter had died in 1885 of a smallpox virus they contracted on his return from a London campaign. Palmer named one of his sons Charles Bradlaugh Palmer.Bury Free Press, March 3, 1915 He was succeeded by his son, William Edwart Gladstone Palmer, who begun the milling, pig merchants and farm side of the business as well as the Elmswell Bacon Factory and E Rand & Son of Wetherden. He married Mable Woods, dying in 1968. William James Palmer's grandson Roy Palmer succeeded and founded the Village & Bakery Museum. He married Margaret Burns from Ulster and died in 1989. The family had milling, arable and pig farming interests in the village and district together with three windmills, but these closed in the 1980s with the family retaining the farm business of just over 1000 acres of mainly arable farm and the property arm of just over 200 mixed commercial and residential properties in Haughley and in Northern Ireland. The business is run by fourth-generation descendant Kenneth Palmer who upon leaving the Ipswich School joined his father Roy in 1965.Stowmarket Family Businesses \\"Serving through the generations\\" by Steve Williams page 67 to 82History of Palmers Leaflet - Suffolk Record Office In 1978 the bakery was the subject of an edition of the BBC children's television series You & Me, and featured Kenneth and his son, former lawyer Kieron Palmer.East Anglian Daily Times, 4 March 1978 In 2010, Palmers employed 18 people in the village and over 30 more at shops across Suffolk, and won a long-lasting dispute with the parish council over rights of access and services to its bakehouse on the village green. In the summer of 2019 a 'funday' and fireworks display was held, attended by 2,500 people, and a village museum based on the Palmer family archive was established. In October 2019, to commemorate the Armistice, Kieron Palmer erected 41 silhouettes of soldiers on the village green, representing the 41 Haughley men who fell in the two World Wars. =Transport= The village was served by Haughley Road railway station (on the Ipswich and Bury Railway, later part of the Eastern Union Railway) from 1846 to 1849, and then Haughley railway station (built for the Great Eastern Railway) from 1849 to its closure in 1967 as part of the Beeching cuts. The Mid-Suffolk Light Railway branch line ran from Haughley to Laxfield and was initially intended to run further to Southwold. The Haughley junction is a key junction for rail traffic in East Anglia and as such suffered heavy bombing during World War II. The station, its four platforms and turntable were demolished in the 1980s except for one small waiting room. Haughley Market Haughley was once the location of a market, predating that of nearby Stowmarket. Before the Norman conquest in 1066, an \\"old Saxon market\\" was situated outside the outer bailey of Haughley Castle,Haughley Markett by K.W.R.V. Palmer, Page 16 to 18 - Emphera - Suffolk Record OfficeManorial Survey 1554 - Suffolk Record Office & Palmer family archive in Duke Street next to the entrance to Castle Farm. After the conquest, the market moved to the current site of the village green. The formal grant of a Saturday market was given on 4 August 1227 by Henry III to Hubert de Burgh, then Lord of the Manor. At that time the outer bailey ditch was being filled in and houses erected upon it (i.e. The Post Office to the White House (Crown Hall) row of properties). The market was extensive, and carefully regulated; traders ‚Äî including one \\"William Hoxon\\" in 1464 from Stowmarket ‚Äî were fined as late as the reign of James I for lying in wait to sell meat and eggs outside the bounds of the market. Butchers from Stowmarket were fined in 1540 for selling meat outside the market on market day to the tune of 3s 6d.Hollingsworth, p.66.Kirby, p.190 By 1500 the market place was surrounded on all sides by buildings backing on to Market Street (today known as Old Street) and Dial Farm. Haughley House, formerly known as the ‚ÄúTumbledown Poor House‚Äù, is a remnant of two houses as an end of terrace and the only remaining row of the south side of the market place. The Angel Inn and the Crown Inn faced directly into the market, which had at least 40 stall placements of around square. Today only one side survives and one building on another side, the Bakehouse - like the Bakehouse, the Counting House and Antrim House deeds similarly described themselves as \\"stalls\\". A continuation of properties either side of the Bakehouse to the village pump can be noted today by the different height of the banks of village green along the trackway. Over time, properties and stalls became \\"wasted\\" - derelict. From the mid 17th century, the market declined and following a great fire in the village in 1710, \\"Stowmarket rose from the ashes\\". In 1855 the market was discontinued, and the space became a village green by grant of enclosure.

Geography A town of light industry and farming situated in the valley of the Eaulne river, in the Pays de Caux, some east of Dieppe, at the junction of the D149 and the D920 roads. Heraldry History Known by various versions of the name over the years, it is first cited as Edremau, around 735‚Äì745, then Ebremau and Evremou in 875 then Envremou in the 12th century. The name is derived from the Celtic Eburomagos, based on the terms eburo (wild boar) and magos, a market. Archaeological excavations have unearthed Gallic gold and some Roman coins found at a place called Le Bucq. Many other relics dating after the fall of the Roman Empire have been found northeast of the church. Eight hundred graves were brought to light, with 460 skeletons of warriors with their weapons (angons, seax, spatha, etc.), also women adorned with jewelry and other ornaments. There were horses'tombs typical for the Germanic tradition, that is often found in the north of Europe, but quite rarely in France. These tombs demonstrate a Frankish military presence (5th and 6th century), with their families. During the Merovingian era, after the fall of the Roman Empire, the village became capital of the ‚ÄúPays de Talou‚Äù. In a charter dated 912, The Norman leader Rollo confirmed his possession of the stronghold of Envermeu. In 1052, the priory of Saint-Laurent d'Envermeu was founded on the site of a Gallo-Roman villa by Hugh, Lord of Envermeu and his brother Turold. Following the famine and plague that ravaged the region in 1244, Envermeu only numbered 140 homes. The 13th century was also marked by the construction of the chapel at St. Guillain and the foundation, by Michel Taupin and his wife Amelie Guillemette, of the hospital of Saint-Nicolas. In 1472, the town of Envermeu was burned down by troops of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. During the Wars of Religion, Envermeu was looted by Protestants from Dieppe, on 8 July 1562. In 1589, Henri de Navarre (the future Henri IV) stayed in Envermeu Castle, which was located on the right bank of the Eaulne. In the 18th century, a massive fire destroyed much of the town, which had at that time a population of 1610. During the Napoleonic Wars and the liberation of France in 1814, Envermeu had to accommodate the British artillery for 3 months. The commune experienced rapid growth in the 19th century. In 1827, the post office was established. The current town hall was built in 1865. In 1885, the railway line linking Dieppe with Eu was opened. The electrification of the village was completed in 1892. The market hall was built in 1900. 53 soldiers from Envermeu were killed during the First World War. To their memory, a granite monument was commissioned and inaugurated on 23 November 1919. Envermeu absorbed the hamlets of Hybouville and Saint-Laurent-d'Envermeu in 1822 and Auberville-on-Eaulne in 1843.

It is a remake of the 1932 film One Way Passage and itself was remade into the 1954 Mexican 3-D film El valor de vivir. Plot Total strangers Dan Hardesty and Joan Ames meet by chance in a crowded bar in Hong Kong when she admires the \\"Paradise cocktail\\" that Dan has just concocted. He asks for another glass and pours half of his drink into it. After they drink, he breaks off the bowl of his glass and places the stem on the bar; she follows suit, and he helps her to place the stem of her glass across his. Dan leaves the bar and is promptly handcuffed by Lieutenant Steve Burke of the San Francisco police. Burke has spent a year chasing Dan, a convicted murderer who jumped off a train on his way to San Quentin to be hanged. He takes Dan to an ocean liner for the journey to San Francisco. As they are boarding, Dan jumps into the water (with Steve still handcuffed to him). He takes the key to the handcuffs from Steve's pocket and frees himself. He starts to swim away, but turns back to rescue non-swimmer Steve before making his getaway. Dan is recaptured and put aboard the ship. \\"Rocky\\" Rockingham T. Rockingham (Frank McHugh, reprising his role in One Way Passage) scrambles aboard at the last minute. Joan is also a passenger. When she collapses, the ship's doctor learns of her fatal heart condition, but she plans to keep going \\"around the little world.\\" Once they are underway, Steve allows Dan the freedom of the ship. In the bar, Dan encounters Rocky, an old friend, and asks for his help. Joan enters the bar, shares another Paradise with Dan, and their courtship begins. Also aboard is another of Dan's old friends, the \\"Comtesse de Bresac\\". The Comtesse is actually Liz, a con artist trained by Dan when she was young. She is still a little in love with him. When she learns of Dan's predicament, she keeps a smitten Steve occupied and secretly empties his gun of bullets. A romance develops between the mismatched pair. As they near Honolulu, Steve overhears Joan and Dan plan to spend the next day ashore. He takes Dan to the brig. Dan picks up a bottle to knock him out, but Steve shoots it (he had checked his gun and reloaded it). Liz slips Steve some sleeping pills and frees Dan. When he is spotted by Joan, he postpones his \\"business\\" to go on their outing. Later, on the way back, Dan stops the rented car before they reach the pier. However, when Joan collapses, Dan carries her back aboard. The ship's doctor tells Dan about Joan's prognosis. Liz tells a stunned Dan that he still has time to get away. From the doorway, Steve says, \\"No, he doesn't.\\" On the last night, everyone on shipboard is partying. Liz asks Burke why he has been avoiding her since Honolulu. He reveals that he got a cable about her. She tries to bribe him, to no avail. However, he is still attracted to her, saying there is less room between a cop and a countess than a cop and a con. In the bar, Dan and Joan bid each other goodbye, sharing one last Paradise cocktail and promising to meet in Mexico City at the Palace Bar on New Year's Eve. The next morning in San Francisco, the assistant purser tips a newspaper reporter that Dan spent a lot of time with Joan. The reporter tricks his way into Joan's stateroom and reveals Dan's fate to her. Frantic, she rushes out and finds Dan on deck. They bid each other goodbye, each concealing what they know about the other. In the Palace Bar in Mexico City, the crowd is celebrating New Year's. Two bartenders hear the sound of glass breaking and turn to find a pair of glasses with the stems crossed on the bar.  Production  The film was based on the story by Robert Lord that was the basis for One Way Passage. Lord won an Academy Award in 1933 in the category Best Writing, Original Story for the earlier film. The same basic musical theme is used in both films. Leo F. Forbstein, Music Director on this film, was Vitaphone Orchestra Conductor for One Way Passage. Ray Heindorf did the orchestral arrangements.  Reception  Variety staff praised the film, observing that although it was a remake, it \\"still has plenty of sock left‚Äù and that the two leads did ‚Äúan excellent job. Oberon's sincere and eye-filling performance equals that of her predecessor in the role, while Brent comes within at least a shade of Powell's superb portrayal.\\" The New York Times critic Benjamin Crisler disagreed, writing, \\"It may be that quite a number of people, touched by the synthetic tragedy of it, will mistake 'Til We Meet Again' for art, but the fact remains that it is just a very sad remake of 'One Way Passage'\\".

Geography A village of forestry and farming in the Pays de Caux, some east of Le Havre, at the junction of the D484 and D982 roads. History The village is located on an old Roman road which runs from \\"Juliobona\\" (Lillebonne) to \\"Rotomagus\\" (Rouen). Another Roman road linking \\"Breviodurum\\" (Brionne) to \\"Mediolanum\\" (√âvreux), also crosses La Frenaye's borders. The name comes from the Latin fracsinus, meaning ‚Äò‚Äôplace of the ash trees‚Äô‚Äô. The Gallo-Roman period is often mentioned in the history of the region, many relics having been found in excavations and having discovered the foundations of two military camps protecting the Roman roads. A farm still operates to this day, bearing the name of ‚Äò‚ÄôLionni√®re‚Äô‚Äô, supposedly used to keep the lions and other wild animals during the celebrations organised in the amphitheatre at Lillebonne. The 1 August 1914 saw the mobilisation of 60 men of the village. 30 were killed and five were missing by the end of World War I. In 1939, soldiers were again mobilised. In 1940 the exodus of Frenaysiens reached its peak, with rumours of German atrocities. During this period many Frenaysien soldiers were imprisoned in Germany or were requisitioned for compulsory labour. During the night of 7 August 1944, a Royal Air Force Lancaster crashed in La Frenaye. Three British airmen were killed and now rest in La Frenaye cemetery. On 30 August 1944 the Germans left La Frenaye. Population Places of interest * The church of St. Jacques, dating from the sixteenth century. * The chateau de Freneuse. * An ancient manorhouse.

Plot Orson is asked to pay a visit to Mike at the rehabilitation center. Orson is worried that the hit-and-run incident is found out by Mike. However, Mike asks Orson for forgiveness as he had asked Orson to prescribe drugs to him without thinking about the consequences. Orson sighs in relief, yet he still feels guilty. Later at night, he is found naked in the kitchen by Susan. Bree and Orson brush it off, when Susan brings it up the next morning, as her \\"naughty dream\\". Susan again finds him naked the next night on her front lawn, and discovers that he is sleepwalking. In the end, when Julie comes home from the ball, she hears him say in his sleep that he ran over Mike. Gaby struggles with the reality of Carlos's blindness. She meets Lynette at the supermarket one day and notices a lot of empty parking spaces, which are meant for people with disabilities. When Lynette tells Gaby that she can apply for the disabled parking permit, Gaby immediately sees this as an advantage to get to park at parking spaces for people with disabilities. She even gets into a fight with a man in a wheelchair. Later, she convinces Carlos to go on an outing, but it turns out that she was only exploiting him for parking space while she ran her errands. When Carlos confronts her about her actions, she finally breaks down that it is hard to take care of him as she has to remember to do menial chores for the convenience of Carlos and constantly worrying about him, and she wants something to make her life easier. Lynette is surprised when Rick returns to see her and announces that he is opening a new restaurant near Scavo's pizzeria. Later, the police come to Lynette's house to investigate the vandalism of Rick's restaurant. Tom lies to the police that he did not see anything, but later admits that he did it out of jealousy, and their children overhear Tom and Lynette arguing. During the ball, Lynette had received a call from Andrew, informing her about a fire that took place in Rick's restaurant. Tom appeared at the ball moments after she received the bad news, leaving her suspicious whether Tom started the arson. Bree and Katherine join forces to plan the Founders Day Ball, despite the rest of the housewives' concerns about their rivalry. As the planning takes place, Katherine starts to take over all the decision making. Bree feels threatened that Katherine tries to overrule any decisions Bree makes, even taking over the role of presenting the award. Katherine also insists that no food will be sent out without her tasting it. Bree then discovers a spoiled dip and wants to throw it away, but is quickly prevented by Katherine for food tasting. The dip makes Katherine sick, and yet she insists on playing her role as the presenter. Surprisingly, Bree is the one who is receiving the award. Katherine confronts Bree when the ball concludes, and tells Bree that she genuinely wanted to be her friend. Bree explains that everyone in her circle of friends has a certain niche, and she doesn't know how to make friends with Katherine. Katherine said that she is almost the same as Bree and understands her better than anyone else, and that should not prevent them from being best friends.
