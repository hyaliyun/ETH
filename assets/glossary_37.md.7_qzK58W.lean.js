The Padre Hotel. Accessed: Oct 9, 2012.  History  Originally built in 1928, the eight-story Spanish Colonial Revival hotel had an auspicious and flamboyant beginning in the Central Valley’s early and notorious Oil Rush days, but none quite so colorful as that of Milton “Spartacus” Miller, who purchased The Padre in 1954. For the next 45 years, he did spirited battle with Bakersfield’s city fathers over a myriad of issues, even mounting a fake missile on the roof, defiantly directed at City Hall with no small disdain. Miller died in 1999. A fire on the seventh floor in the 1950s resulted in many deaths, including children. Several children were tragically trapped and died in the basement during the 1952 earthquake. There have also been many suicides from the roof of the Padre Hotel. The Padre Hotel fell into disrepair and was a derelict hotel from the 1960s until its most recent renovation in 2010. Prior to that renovation, the upper floors were condemned but often had squatters occupying the rooms. The bar downstairs stayed open during this time and was a meeting place for the city's misfits and barflies.

There are several families of dual-specificity phosphatase enzymes in mammals. All share a similar catalytic mechanism, by which a conserved cysteine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the phosphate group to be eliminated. The residues surrounding their catalytic core obey a rather strict consensus: His-Cys-x-x-x-x-x-Arg-Ser. The serine side chain and an additional conserved aspartate play a central role in the elimination of the Cys-linked intermediate, thus completing their enzymatic cycle. The main difference between tyrosine-specific phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases lies in the width of the latter enzymes' catalytic pocket: thus they can accommodate phosphorylated serine or threonine side chains as well as phosphorylated tyrosines. Classification The human genome encodes at least 61 different DUSP proteins. The following major groups or families of DUSPs were identified: * Slingshot phosphatases: There are three members of this family (SSH1L, SSH2L and SSH3L) with broad specificity. They contain SH3-binding motifs as well as F-actin binding motifs, thus they are generally believed to play a role in the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements. In accordance with their proposed rule, proteins like ADF, cofilin and LIMK1 are slingshot substrates. * Phosphatases of Regenerating Liver (PRLs): Three PRL genes were described in mammals (PRL-1, PRL-2 and PRL-3). They share a high sequence identity and possess an N-terminal prenylation sequence (CAAX box). Despite their up-regulation in colorectal cancer, the role and substrate specificity of PRLs is poorly known. * Cdc14 phosphatases: The four mammalian Cdc14 proteins (named KAP, Cdc14A, Cdc14B and PTP9Q22) play a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases, most importantly CDK2. * PTEN and myotubularin phosphatases There are five PTEN-like phosphatases encoded in the human genome. Though structurally related to other DUSPs, these are not strictly phosphorotein-phosphatases, since their most important substrates are phosphorylated inositol lipids. Myotubularins similarly display a preference towards certain phosphatidyl inositols. * Mitogen-activated protein Kinase Phosphatases (MKPs) MKPs form a rather large family, with some 11 well- characterized members. They are responsible for the dephosphorylation of active mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In accordance with this role, several (but not all) MKPs contain an additional, N-terminal domain. Although structurally similar to Cdc14, this extra domain is inactive, and plays a role in substrate recruitment. The surface of this substrate-binding domain mimics the D-motifs found in intrinsically disordered substrates of MAPKs. * In addition, there are several dual-specificity phosphatases lacking close relatives. Most of these atypical DUSPs are poorly characterized. Some of them are probably inactive, and only mediate protein-protein interactions.

Built in 1835, it is the largest known 19th-century rowhouse in the state, and is a local example of Greek Revival architecture. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The Park Street Row is located in the eastern section of Portland's West End neighborhood, occupying the entire west side of Park Street between Spring and Gray Streets. It consists of fourteen residential units, built out of brick with brownstone trim, resting on granite foundations. Each unit is four stories tall, with a dormered and skylit roof. The fronts of the units are three bays wide, with entrances in the right-hand bay. Iron railings are set on granite curbing between the stairs leading to each unit, and shallow iron balconies run the width of each unit. Due to the street's slope, the units are stepped in pairs. This housing project was one of the most ambitious of its type undertaken in 19th-century Maine. A consortium of investors formed the Ann Street Company (Park Street was previously Ann Street) in 1835, purchased land nearly to Congress Street, and began construction on these rowhouses. These fourteen units were completed, as were six more that faced Gray and Spring Streets; the three on Spring Street also survive. Due to financial difficulties, the company was only able to complete the building exteriors, and they were auctioned off, unfinished, in October 1835. The individual unit interiors were then completed by their purchasers. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Portland, Maine References The Park Street Row in November 2011.

Howley was a Protestant, and worked as a carpenter in his native place, Roscrea, co. Tipperary. He took part in the rebellion of 1798 and in Robert Emmet's insurrection. While engaged in the latter plot he was the ostensible proprietor of the store in Thomas Street, and to him was assigned the task of bringing up the coaches by means of which Emmet designed to effect his entrance into Dublin Castle. While engaged, however, in carrying out this part of the programme, and as he was passing along Bridgefoot Street, Howley stopped to interfere in a common street brawl, which ended with him shooting Colonel Lyde Brown. Compelled thereupon to consult his own safety, Howley left the coaches to their fate and fled. To this untoward accident Emmet chiefly ascribed the failure of his plot. Howley's hiding-place was subsequently betrayed by a fellow-workman, Anthony Finnerty, to Major Sirr. In the scuffle to arrest him Howley shot one of the major's men, and escaped into a hayloft in Pool Street, but was soon captured. He was condemned to death by special commission on 27 September 1803 and confessed to having killed Colonel Brown.

The account of Waltheof and his family in Cumbrian monastic cartularies (St Bees and Wetheral), says that he gave land in Allerdale to his three sisters, Octreda, Gunhilda and Maud. Waltheof had two sons and several daughters.Hamilton, Mighty Subjects, pp. 28–29 Alan (fl. 1139), succeeded to Allerdale.Hedley, Northumberland Families, vol. i, p. 241 The other son was named Gopspatric.Hedley, Northumbrian Families, vol. i, p. 239 A definite daughter, Ethelreda, married Ranulf de Lindsay and then William de Esseville.Barrow, Kingdom of the Scots, p. 139 Another, Gunnilda, married Uhtred of Galloway.

History \\"Little Spain\\" was on 14th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. A very different section of Chelsea existed on a stretch of 14th Street often referred to by residents as Calle Catorce (\\"Street Fourteen\\") or as \\"Little Spain\\". The Church of Our Lady of Guadelupe (No. 299) was founded in 1902, when Spaniards started to settle in the area. Although the Spanish business have given way to such nightclubs as Nell's and Oh Johnny on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the Spanish food and gift emporium known as Casa Moneo has been at 210 West 14th since 1929. In 2010 the documentary Little Spain, directed and written by Artur Balder, was filmed in New York City. The documentary pulled together for first time an archive that reveals the untold history of the Spanish-American presence in Manhattan. They present the history of the streets of Little Spain in New York City throughout the 20th Century. The archive contains more than 450 photographs and 150 documents that have never been publicly displayed. Other important commerces and Spanish business of Little Spain were restaurants like La Bilbaína, Trocadero Valencia, Bar Coruña, Little Spain Bar, Café Madrid, Mesón Flamenco, or El Faro Restaurant. The Iberia was a famous Spanish dress shop. The heart of the Spanish American community in that area were the two landmarks: the Spanish Benevolent Society and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, founded at the turn of the 19th century, being the first parish in Manhattan with mass in Latin and Spanish. Just like with other immigrant neighborhoods of Manhattan, such as Little Italy, Little Spain celebrated a feast day; that of St. James. It was held in June, and was held until the mid-1990s. During this festival, the saint's image was the symbol of the feeling of the Spanish community and paraded down the street 14, which was cut to traffic for a week. In this time, food festivals were taking place shows of typical Spanish folklore. Virginia Admiral and her son, Robert Anthony De Niro Jr., moved to a top floor studio at the 219 West 14th Street, owned by the Galician entrepreneur José García. According to investigations, Robert De Niro was living during the 1950s at the heart of Little Spain after the divorce of his parents.

Although the theatre was not purpose-built for dramatic performances, surviving records show that it had boxes, a pit, a balcony and two galleries, together with significant backstage machinery, suggesting that it was a substantial structure. Plays were performed on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings between July and October. During cold weather the theatre was heated by burning fires for two days before a performance. Like all early Birmingham theatres the Moor Street Theatre was not licensed for dramatic performance, so technically charged for the performance of music during the interval - the play itself being given free of charge.; The top seat prices of 2 shillings and 6 pence suggest a well-off audience and, following the lead of David Garrick, performances were given in costumes \\"proper to the play\\". The theatre was managed by John Ward during the 1740s, who had established Birmingham's first professional theatre company – the Warwickshire Company of Comedians – by 1744. A visit in 1751 by Richard Yates and 'His Majesty's Servants from the Theatres Royal in London' – essentially the company from the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane – was so successful that Yates' company was installed permanently in the theatre, and two years later Yates was encouraged to open the much larger King Street Theatre. The Moor Street Theatre was increasingly unable to compete and closed in 1763. The composer Barnabas Gunn promoted orchestral concerts at the theatre from 1740 - the earliest secular classical music concerts recorded in Birmingham. The existence of two theatres in the town had been controversial with Birmingham's religious non-conformists. When the closed Moor Street Theatre was converted into a Methodist chapel in 1764, John Wesley preached how \\"Happy would it be, if all playhouses in the kingdom were converted to so good an use\\", though some elements of the town evidently disagreed, and stoned the congregation as they left.

The founder of the Warwickshire Company of Comedians – a Birmingham- based theatre company who toured throughout the West Midlands and into Wales during the mid to late eighteenth century – he was the first of the Kemble family theatrical dynasty, whose most notable member was his granddaughter Sarah Siddons. Ward was the first recorded performer of a Shakespearian play in Stratford-upon-Avon, and is also notable as the author of the two earliest surviving prompt books of Shakespeare's Hamlet, which reveal how the play was performed in eighteenth century England and also throw light on earlier practice.

Sir Ernest Gray (27 August 1856 – 6 May 1932) was a British educational reformer and Conservative politician. Early life and educational work The son of William Gray, he attended primary school and St John's Training College, Battersea. On completion of his training, he worked as an elementary school teacher and science lecturer. He married Florence Caroline Garside in 1883. By 1894 he had become headmaster of St Gabriel's School, Pimlico and was elected as president of the National Union of Teachers. He received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford in the same year. He later spent many years as secretary to the education committee of the union, and was joint editor of a number of education handbooks. He served as a member of the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education from 1900 to 1908. He was appointed an Officer de l’Instruction Publique by the French government for services to education. Gray held a commission in the Volunteer Force and the successor Territorial Force of the British Army, rising to the rank of major in the 6th Battalion, Essex Regiment. Politics Politically, Gray was a Conservative, and in 1895 he was chosen by the party to contest the constituency of West Ham North. Gray had the full support of the National Union of Teachers, and was able to unseat the Liberal member of parliament, magazine publisher Archibald Grove. He retained the seat at the 1900 election, but was defeated in 1906. He made an unsuccessful attempt to regain the West Ham North seat in January 1910. At the next general election in December 1910 he contested the Lancashire seat of Accrington but failed to be elected. In the meantime, Gray had been elected to the London County Council as a member of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party. In 1907 the Municipal Reformers gained control of the council, and Gray was elected to represent Hoxton. At the next council elections in 1910 he became a councillor for Brixton, holding the seat until 1925. He was vice chairman of the council in 1915–1916. He returned to parliament at the 1918 general election, having received the \\"coalition coupon\\", and was elected as Coalition Conservative member of parliament for Accrington. He was defeated at the next general election in 1922, when the seat was gained by the Labour Party. Later life Gray retired from the London County Council in 1925, and was knighted for \\"political and public services\\" in the same year. He died in Hampstead, aged 73, in May 1932 and was cremated at Golders Green.

The town was informally established soon after 1843 on the Santa Ana River, across from the town of Agua Mansa. La Placita and Agua Mansa were the first non-native settlements in the San Bernardino Valley. Together, they were referred to as \\"San Salvador\\", and were the largest settlements between New Mexico and Los Angeles in the 1840s. History A group of genízaro colonists from Abiquiú, New Mexico, arrived in the area in the early 1840s. Don Juan Bandini donated a portion of Rancho Jurupa to them on the condition that they would assist in protecting his livestock from Indian raids. Lorenzo Trujillo led ten of the colonist families to 2,000 acres on the \\"Bandini Donation\\" on the southeast bank of the Santa Ana River and formed the village of La Placita while others went to the northwest bank of the river and created the town of Agua Mansa. Farms, orchards, and vineyards were planted and developed after an extensive irrigation system was incorporated. Livestock were tended on the mesa pasture area to the southeast in what is now Riverside. Formal establishment of the area as a political unit occurred in 1852 when the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County established a town called \\"San Salvador\\" encompassing Jurupa, Agua Mansa, and other adjacent settlements; Lorenzo Trujillo's house was established as the official location for elections.Los Angeles Star, 18 September 1852. Accessed from the California Digital Newspaper Collection, http://cdnc.ucr.edu The region now resides in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. After the Great Flood of 1862 and a second flood in 1886, most residents moved to other locations including what is now south Colton. Today, the Agua Mansa cemetery is the main symbol of the history of the region. The area is now dominated by several industrial complexes and Riverside County waste transfer and recycling stations. Unfortunately, the historic nature of this area continues to be lost as local governments move to approve developments including warehousing and high density housing on these lands rather than celebrate and support the history of the area. Culture The town's first church consisted of an arbor. After the adobe church that was built in 1852 collapsed in quicksand, a new church was built in Agua Mansa. Completed in 1853 and dedicated to San Salvador, the church survived through the Great Flood of 1862. The parish of San Salvador de Jurupa included La Placita and Agua Mansa; it was the first non-mission parish in Southern California. However, as residents moved from the area, a new congregation was established in 1893 in Colton, which retains the parish name of San Salvador, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino. The Trujillo Adobe, which had been the home of Lorenzo Trujillo, was donated to the Riverside County Parks Department by JoAnn Conner (Dreesen), the niece of Charles Trujillo..Gunther, p. 549 The small structure south of the San Bernardino County boundary at the corner of Center and Orange Streets has been proposed for historic preservation.

It's a sequel to Fear of Clowns and takes place two years after the events of the original and continues the story of a young woman (Jacky Reres) getting stalked by a killer clown (Mark Lassise). Plot The film begins two years after the events of the first film, with Detective Peters at the Doctor's office, who reveals to Peters that he has Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), and there is no treatment; it's fatal. Two months later, it is revealed that after being sent to jail two years ago, Doug Richardson a.k.a. \\"Shivers The Clown\\" was sent to a mental asylum, and Lynn Blodgett has quit her painting career and gone on to write a book called Coulrophobia, which talks about her \\"fear of clowns\\" and the story about the stalking killer clown two years ago; she and Tucker Reid have broken up and haven't seen each other for a while. But things go terribly wrong: An orderly named Ralph helps Shivers and two other inmates escape the asylum. Shivers takes Ralph and the inmates back to his old house, which is now occupied by a junkie, who is later strangled to death by Shivers. The next day, after hearing of Shiver's escape, Lynn calls Detective Peters and tells him that she will be home soon. Meanwhile, the junkie's friends arrive at the house, only to be killed by the inmates, Giggles The Clown and Ogre The Clown. Meanwhile, Lynn arrives back home and meets Detective Peters at a restaurant, where he reveals that he's going to kill Doug Richardson. As Detective Peters takes Lynn home, they find out that Shivers has just killed Tucker outside an amusement park, where Tucker was constructing a new design for a roller coaster. Peters then calls two police officers to guard Lynn's house before they leave at 9:00 to secluded cabins in the woods. Before they leave, Ogre kills the police officers, while Shivers tries to kill Lynn. But during the process, Shivers kills Giggles instead. Peters and Lynn escape through the cellar, while Shivers takes off in the van (where Ralph is handcuffed), leaving Ogre behind to mourn over Giggle's dead body, as he was Ogre's best friend. Ogre then takes off to go after Shivers for revenge. The next day, Peters and Lynn arrive at the cabins, where they are greeted by Hot Rod, Stoltz, and Rego, who are all friends of Peters. Meanwhile, Shivers leaves Ralph in the van while he goes to the bathroom, and Ralph calls an anonymous person, telling him that he needs to pay him (Ralph) more money if he (the caller) wants the job to be done. Then, Shivers leaves to go find Lynn, only to end up at the Horner's home, killing the entire family. Shivers then continues on to find the cabins. Peters goes outside to see if the coast is clear, only to be axed in the side. Lynn takes off into the woods with Shivers on her tail, leaving the axe inside Peters. Peters, who is still alive, reloads his gun and drags himself to where Lynn and Shivers ran off to. Peters finds them, and shoots Shivers two times: once in the hand, the other in the back, and Shivers falls into a gully. Lynn goes to check to see if Peters is okay, but looks to see Shivers rise up out of the gully. Lynn takes Peter's gun and points it at Shivers, but before she can pull the trigger, Stoltz (who was only injured in the face) pops out of nowhere and shoots Shivers three times in the chest, knocking him back into the gully. It is never revealed whether Peters is dead, or he's just simply unconscious. The police arrive, only to find out that there's no body in the gully, only that there is a trail of blood that leads a hundred feet south, where Shivers climbed out of the gully and went into the woods. Sgt. Raup (Vincent T. Brown) decides to break the news to Lynn in the morning after she gets a good night sleep. The ending leaves it ambiguous as to whether Shivers is alive, or he died after heading out into the woods. Cast *Jacky Reres as Lynn Blodgett *Mark Lassise as Shivers The Clown *Frank A.

He is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles.https://sciarc.edu/news/2016/philosopher-graham- harman-to-join-sci-arc/ His work on the metaphysics of objects led to the development of object-oriented ontology. He is a central figure in the speculative realism trend in contemporary philosophy.Brassier, Ray, Iain Hamilton Grant, Graham Harman, and Quentin Meillassoux. 2007. \\"Speculative Realism\\" in Collapse III: Unknown Deleuze. London: Urbanomic. Biography Harman was born in Iowa City and raised in Mount Vernon, Iowa. He received a B.A. from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland in 1990 and went on to graduate school at Penn State University to earn a master's degree, studying under philosopher Alphonso Lingis, in 1991. While pursuing a Ph.D. at DePaul University, Harman worked as an online sports reporter, an experience which he credits for developing his writing style and productivity. After finishing his degree in 1999 he joined the Department of Philosophy at the American University in Cairo, where he taught from 2000-2016, leaving at the rank of Distinguished University Professor. He has also been a visiting faculty member at the University of Amsterdam, University of Turin, and Yale University. Since 2013 he has been a faculty member at the European Graduate School.https://egs.edu/faculty/graham-harman Philosophical work Harman starts the development of his work with Martin Heidegger's concept of \\"tool- analysis\\" from Being and Time. To Harman, tool-analysis was a key discovery which establishes the groundwork for taking seriously the autonomous existence of objects and, in doing so, highlights deficiencies in phenomenology due to its subordination of objects to their use by or relationship with humans. Harman is considered part of the speculative realism trend, a nebulous grouping of philosophers united by two perspectives: a rejection of anthropocentric \\"philosophies of access\\" which privilege the perspective of humans in relation to objects, and a support of metaphysical realism via rejection of \\"correlationism\\", an assumption in Post-Kantian philosophy that fellow speculative realist Quentin Meillassoux defines as \\"the idea according to which we only ever have access to the correlation between thinking and being, and never to either term considered apart from the other.\\"Quentin Meillassoux, After Finitude, 5. Harman's object-oriented approach considers the life of objects to be fertile ground for a metaphysics that works to overcome anthropocentrism and correlationism. According to Harman, everything is an object, whether it be a mailbox, a shadow, spacetime, a fictional character, or the Commonwealth of Nations. However, drawing on phenomenology, he does distinguish between two categories of objects: real objects and sensual objects (or intentional objects), which sets his philosophy apart from the flat ontology of Bruno Latour.Harman, G. (2009) Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics. Melbourne: re.press. Harman defines real objects as inaccessible and infinitely withdrawn from all relations and then puzzles over how such objects can be accessed or enter into relations: \\"by definition, there is no direct access to real objects. Real objects are incommensurable with our knowledge, untranslatable into any relational access of any sort, cognitive or otherwise. Objects can only be known indirectly. And this is not just the fate of humans — it’s the fate of everything.\\" Central to Harman's philosophy is the idea that real objects are inexhaustible: \\"A police officer eating a banana reduces this fruit to a present-at-hand profile of its elusive depth, as do a monkey eating the same banana, a parasite infecting it, or a gust of wind blowing it from a tree. Banana-being is a genuine reality in the world, a reality never exhausted by any relation to it by humans or other entities.\\" (Harman 2005: 74). Because of this inexhaustibility, claims Harman, there is a metaphysical problem regarding how two objects can ever interact. His solution is to introduce the notion of \\"vicarious causation\\", according to which objects can only ever interact on the inside of an \\"intention\\" (which is also an object).http://faculty.virginia.edu/theorygroup/docs/harman=vicarious- causation.pdf Cutting across the phenomenological tradition, and especially its linguistic turn, Harman deploys a brand of metaphysical realism that attempts to extricate objects from their human captivity and metaphorically allude to a strange subterranean world of \\"vacuum-sealed\\" objects-in- themselves: \\"The comet itself, the monkey itself, Coca-Cola itself, resonate in cellars of being where no relation reaches.\\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/27861685/Harm-an-Graham Strongly sympathetic to panpsychism, Harman proposes a new philosophical discipline called \\"speculative psychology\\" dedicated to investigating the \\"cosmic layers of psyche\\" and \\"ferreting out the specific psychic reality of earthworms, dust, armies, chalk, and stone.\\"Graham Harman, Prince of Networks, 213. Harman does not, however, unreservedly endorse an all-encompassing panpsychism and instead proposes a sort of 'polypsychism' that nonetheless must \\"balloon beyond all previous limits, but without quite extending to all entities\\".Graham Harman 2011, The Quadruple Object He continues by stating that \\"perceiving\\" and \\"non-perceiving\\" are not different kinds of objects, but can be found in the same entity at different times: \\"The important point is that objects do not perceive insofar as they exist, as panpsychism proclaims. Instead they perceive insofar as they relate.\\" Harman rejects scientism on account of its anthropocentrism: \\"For them, raindrops know nothing and lizards know very little, and some humans are more knowledgeable than others.\\"http://ecologywithoutnature.blogspot.com/2011/10/harman-on- anthropocentrism.html Bibliography *Tool-Being: Heidegger and the Metaphysics of Objects (2002) *Guerrilla Metaphysics: Phenomenology and the Carpentry of Things (2005) *Heidegger Explained: From Phenomenon to Thing (2007) * Prince of Networks: Bruno Latour and Metaphysics (2009) *Towards Speculative Realism: Essays and Lectures (2010) *Circus Philosophicus (2010) * L'objet quadruple (2010).

He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 2005. Controversy Fean was Ambassador to Libya during the 2009 release of Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi. In information released in the 2010 Wikileaks cables, he was attributed as saying that “they could have cut us off at the knees” in relation to likely Libyan government actions against UK interests in the country, should Megrahi die in prison in Scotland. Views on recognition of Palestine In December 2014 The New York Times published an opinion piece by Fean in which outlined what he believes are requirements for a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He argues in the article that European countries such as Britain, Spain, France, Ireland as well as the European Parliament are working to promote coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians, and to that end are considering recognition of Palestine as \\"a contribution to a negotiated peace, not a substitute for it. Personal life He and his wife Anne have two daughters and one son. In July 2010, he received an honorary degree from the University of Sheffield. He has been Chairman of the Libyan British Business Council since 2016.

The Lewis offset is a term for the portion of the central groove on a permanent mandibular first molar which lies between the two central pits. It was named for long time dental anatomy instructor Dr. Christopher S. Lewis, a Mercer Island, WA dentist. Details The offset lies at an angle to the mesio-distal axis of the tooth, and causes the mesial portion of the central groove to be located further buccally than the distal portion. This buccolingual shift correlates with a relative difference in size between the mesial and distal cusps on these teeth - the mesiolingual cusp is larger than the mesiobuccal cusp, but the distobuccal cusp is larger than the distolingual cusp. It also allows for the buccal groove to be located mesial to the lingual groove which is mandatory to accommodate the relative sizes of the three cusps on the buccal and two cusps on the lingual of the occlusal surface of the tooth.

He was posted missing, presumed killed, during secondment service with the United States Air Force in the Korean War. Career The only son of Chambré Baldwin (1884–1969) and Grace Baldwin, John Baldwin was born in Bath. Beginning as ground crew with the RAFVR at the start of the Second World War, he served in France during 1940 and spent the ‘Blitz’ period on bomb disposal duties. Baldwin volunteered for aircrew in 1941 and trained as a pilot. Commissioned as a pilot officer in March 1942, he joined No. 609 Squadron RAF on 17 November 1942, flying the Hawker Typhoon. His first success was damaging a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in December 1942. On 20 January 1943 fighter-bombers from Jagdgeschwader 26 (JG 26) (fighter wing), supported by JG 2 attacked London in daylight with some 90 Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Fw 190s in three waves. No. 609 Squadron intercepted the second wave and claimed four Bf 109-Gs from 6 squadrons of JG 26. Three of these successes were by Baldwin. Postwar research indicates that these may have included Leutnant Wenzel, reported as missing, and Unteroffiziers Marquardt and Budde, who were both captured. Baldwin met the two captured pilots a few days later. On 25 March he was shot down over the English Channel by a Fw 190. On 4 October 1943 he claimed two Bf 109's of JG 2. On 16 October 1943, six Typhoons from 609 Squadron encountered several Ju 88s, three being claimed, with a half-share to Baldwin. From mid-October 1942 to June 1943 the squadron claimed some 27 of the 47 air victories claimed by Typhoons, making it the most successful Typhoon squadron. Baldwin moved from No. 609 Squadron to command No. 198 Squadron RAF in November 1943. On 1 December he destroyed a Fw 190 and on 4 December a Dornier Do 217 bomber, his ninth victory. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC and destroyed three Fw 190s and a Caudron Goeland (utility passenger aircraft) during January 1944. His tour ended in April 1944, and he served with No 2 Group Operations staff. In June 1944 he was appointed to command No. 146 Wing RAF. On 29 June 1944, flying with 193 Squadron, he shot down two Bf 109's, and two weeks later on 3 July, flying with 197 Squadron, he destroyed another. During operations following the invasion of north-west Europe, Baldwin was involved in a \\"friendly fire\\" incident. On 27 August 1944, his wing was requested by the Royal Navy to attack enemy vessels off Le Havre. Typhoons of No. 263 Squadron RAF and No. 266 Squadron RAF attacked the ships. Baldwin requested clarification, as the ships did not appear to be enemy, but he was told to press on. The ships turned out to be the Royal Navy's 1st Minesweeping Flotilla. In the course of the attack, and were sunk, while had her stern blown off. The attacks cost 117 sailors killed and 153 wounded. The subsequent court of enquiry identified the fault as lying entirely with the Navy; the officer arranging the minesweeping had not informed others of the area of operations. In February 1945 he assumed command of No. 123 Wing RAF. During the last days of the war in Europe, he was commanding the Wing in operations against enemy shipping in the Baltic Sea. On 3 May 1945 squadrons of 83 Group were attacking enemy shipping, and No. 198, No. 184, No. 193, No. 263, and No. 197 squadrons attacked the passenger liners and and the freighter , which were believed to be used by the Germans to escape. The ships had actually been used by the Germans to house prisoners, many from the concentration camp at Neuengamme. As a result of the attack over 7,000 died. He was credited with 15 and 1 shared aerial victories destroyed, 4 damaged, and 5 damaged on the ground as well as many ground vehicles. He was awarded a permanent commission in the RAF in October 1946. He then led a team of four pilots from the RAF Central Fighter Establishment on attachment to the USAF in Korea. He flew operationally with the 16th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing. He was posted missing, presumed killed, in March 1952 during the Korean War flying a North American F-86 Sabre. He was profiled on the Nova programme Missing in MiG Alley.

The main centre of karum trading was at the ancient town of Kanesh.  Assyrian settlements  Letter from Assyria to karum Kanesh concerning the trade in precious metals. 1850–1700 BC. Walters Museum (click on image for more info) Early references to karu come from the Ebla tablets; in particular, a vizier known as Ebrium concluded the earliest treaty fully known to archaeology, known variously as the \\"Treaty between Ebla and Aššur\\" or the \\"Treaty with Abarsal\\" (scholars have disputed whether the text refers to Aššur or to Abarsal, an unknown location). In either case, the other city contracted to establish karu in Eblaite territory (Syria), among other things. Sargon the Great (of Akkadia) who likely destroyed Ebla soon afterward, is said in a much-later Hittite account to have invaded Anatolia to punish Nurdaggal, the king of Purushanda (in Anatolia), for mistreating the Akkadian and Assyrian merchant class in the karu there. However, no contemporary source mentions that to be the case. During the 2nd millennium BC, Anatolia was under the sovereignty of Hatti city-states and later the Hittites. By 1960 BC, Assyrian merchants had established the karu,Anadolu Medeniyetleri Müzesi, Ankara, small colonial settlements next to Anatolian cities, which paid taxes to the rulers of the cities.Seton Lloyd: Ancient Turkey (Translation: Ender Verinlioğlu) Tubitak, Ankara, 1998, p. 18–19 There were also smaller trade stations which were called mabartū (singular mabartum). The number of karu and mabartu was probably around 20. Among them were Kültepe (Kanesh in antiquity) in modern Kayseri Province; Alişar Hüyük (Ankuva (?) in antiquity) in modern Yozgat Province; and Boğazköy (Hattusa in antiquity) in modern Çorum Province. (However, Alişar Hüyük was probably a mabartum.) However, after the establishment of the Hittite Empire, the karu disappeared from Anatolian history.  Trade  Trade patterns of karu In the 2nd millennium BC, money had not yet been invented, and Assyrian merchants used gold for wholesale trade and silver for retail trade. Gold was considered eight times more valuable than silver. However, another metal, amutum, was even more valuable than gold. It is thought to be the newly-discovered iron and was forty times more valuable than silver. The most important Anatolian export was copper, and the Assyrian merchants sold tin and clothing to Anatolia.Ekrem Akurgal: Anadolu Kültür Tarihi, Tubitak, Ankara, 2000, p. 40–41  Legacy  The name Karum is given to an upscale shopping mall in Çankaya district of modern-day Ankara, Turkey.

Each sonata was dedicated to one of Ysaÿe’s contemporary violinists: Joseph Szigeti (No. 1), Jacques Thibaud (No. 2), George Enescu (No. 3), Fritz Kreisler (No. 4), Mathieu Crickboom (No. 5), and Manuel Quiroga (No. 6).  General background  After having heard Joseph Szigeti perform Johann Sebastian Bach's sonata for solo violin in G minor, Ysaÿe was inspired to compose violin works that represent the evolution of musical techniques and expressions of his time. As Ysaÿe claimed, \\"I have played everything from Bach to Debussy, for real art should be international.\\"Martens, Frederick H. Violin Mastery – Talks with Master Violinists and /teachers. New York: Frederick A. Stokes, Co.,1919.p.6 In this set of sonatas, he used prominent characteristics of early 20th century music, such as whole tone scales, dissonances, and quarter tones. Ysaÿe also employed virtuoso bow and left hand techniques throughout, for he believed that \\"at the present day the tools of violin mastery, of expression, technique, mechanism, are far more necessary than in days gone by. In fact they are indispensable, if the spirit is to express itself without restraint.\\"Martens, Frederick H. Violin Mastery – Talks with Master Violinists and /teachers. New York: Frederick A. Stokes, Co.,1919.p.7 Thus, this set of sonatas places high technical demands on its performers. Yet Ysaÿe recurrently warns violinists that they should never forget to play instead of becoming preoccupied with technical elements; a violin master \\"must be a violinist, a thinker, a poet, a human being, he must have known hope, love, passion and despair, he must have run the gamut of the emotions in order to express them all in his playing.\\"Martens, Frederick H.

He was executed for war crimes by Yugoslav authorities following the war. Early life Mehmed Alajbegović was born in Bihać on 7 May 1906, into a Bosniak family. Both his father and grandfather had been mayors of Bihać. Alajbegović finished elementary school and high school in the town and moved to Zagreb in 1928, where he studied law at the University of Zagreb. He received his doctorate in 1934. During his studies, he visited many foreign cities and spent a great deal of time in Paris, where he worked as a Croatian-language teacher. After receiving his doctorate, Alajbegović was named judge at the district court of Prozor. He went on to study Sharia law at the University of Algiers, from which he graduated in 1940. Beginning in 1938, he was also a judge and secretary at the Administrative Court of Zagreb. Alajbegović was one of the participants in establishment, member and a committeeman, of Društvo bosansko-hercegovačkih Hrvata u Zagrebu (Society of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Croats in Zagreb) which was established in March 1939.Zlatko Hasanbegović, Muslimani u Zagrebu 1878.-1945. Doba utemeljenja, Medžlis Islamske zajednice u Zagrebu-Institut društvenih znanosti Ivo Pilar, Zagreb, 2007, pp. 175 and note 336: World War II Following the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH) in April 1941, Alajbegović left his role as professor of Islamic studies at the University of Zagreb and became a diplomat. In August 1941, he became a secretary in the NDH Foreign Ministry. On 27 January 1942, Alajbegović was named Consul to the German Reich in Munich. He held this position until 11 October 1943, when Poglavnik Ante Pavelić made him Minister of Welfare for Perished Lands. In this position, he was responsible for securing more than 300,000 mostly Muslim refugees from various parts of the NDH in eastern Bosnia, Herzegovina and Sandžak; most of these were fleeing the Chetniks. On 5 May 1944, Alajbegović was named Foreign Minister. The Germans interpreted this as an attempt to appease Muslims in the NDH. On 18 and 19 September 1944, Alajbegović accompanied Pavelić on a diplomatic visit to Berlin and met with German leader Adolf Hitler. In the last months of World War II, he attempted to reconcile nationalist factions fighting in occupied Yugoslavia, such as the Montenegrin separatist leader Sekula Drljević, Slovene collaborationist leader Leon Rupnik and Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, in order to form an anti- communist coalition to combat the powerful Yugoslav Partisans and the Red Army. Alajbegović remained Foreign Minister until 6 May 1945, when he fled Zagreb together with other high-ranking NDH officials. He fled Yugoslavia and sought sanctuary in Krumpendorf, Austria. He then moved to Salzburg, where he was arrested by Allied forces on 6 September 1945. He was briefly detained in a prisoner-of-war camp in Glasenbach. Alajbegović was extradited to Yugoslavia three days later, on 9 September. While being interrogated by Yugoslav intelligence agents, he was asked why he joined the Ustaše. He responded, \\"the main motive that led me to join them was that they had an idea for a Croatian state. A great influence on me was made by cognition about the right of the Croatian people to have a state, and other motives were ignored.\\" Alajbegović was charged with various crimes and tried by the Supreme Court of the People's Republic of Croatia in May 1947. He was found guilty of collaboration and sentenced to death on 7 June 1947 and executed the same day.

History According to Putnam County historian Mary Jean DeLozier, the first ‘high school’ established in Cookeville, Tennessee, was a privately funded, four-year subscription high school called Washington Academy. It was established in 1891, on Spring St. where the Cookeville City Hall is today. In 1894, the state transferred Washington Academy into a newly incorporated high school named Cookeville High School. One principal and five teachers constituted the entire twelve-grade faculty with 175 students. In 1899, the old building was razed and a new one built on the same site called Cookeville Collegiate Institute, which was financed by subscriptions, donations, and out-of-town tuition. The school taught eight elementary and four secondary grades in a two-story frame building with 8 rooms and a four-acre yard. After the city of Cookeville incorporated in 1903 and levied taxes for education, its new school used the Cookeville Collegiate Institute building and kept that name for several years until it became known as Cookeville City School in the late 1900s. In 1914, Putnam County levied a 10-cent property tax for education and moved to provide public high school education for all children in Putnam County. In the fall of 1914, Dixie College (later known as Tennessee Polytechnic Institute and today known as Tennessee Technological University) opened the first four-year, county-owned high school. Students attended high school at Dixie College until 1924, when college officials decided they could no longer accommodate high school students. Students then moved back to Cookeville City School. In the 1920s and 1930s, civic leaders began to call for building a new high school in the Cookeville area, but the Quarterly Court (today known as the County Commission) twice refused to vote bonds for a new building. In April 1931, Putnam County put the question to a vote and voters approved a measure to issue $50,000 in bonds to be matched by Cookeville funds to build a new school. In 1932, the county bought 14 acres on the northern side of the city and built Central High School. The building (which later became Prescott Central Middle School and is a part of the campus of Tennessee Tech today) had 14 classrooms, a cafeteria, a gym, an auditorium, science labs, and facilities for teaching home economics and industrial arts. In 1940, Central High School had 12 faculty members and 307 students. By the 1960s, the school was overcrowded, and the Quarterly Court approved a bond issue to build a new $2.2 million high school to house grades 10 through 12. Central High would become a junior high school and Algood High in neighboring Algood, would be phased out, with students there to attend the new Putnam County Senior High. The new school, built on the ‘pod’ concept, was built on E. Spring St. (today Avery Trace Middle School) and its doors opened in 1966. In 1981, following a student initiative, the name was changed from Putnam Senior High to Cookeville High School. By the 1980s, the continuing growth of Cookeville caused more overcrowding problems for the school. A task force composed of citizens, educators, school officials, and government leaders came to the conclusion that a restructuring of school grade levels and some new buildings would solve the problem. They recommended building a new high school, turning the Cookeville Junior High and the existing Cookeville High School into middle schools, and leaving all Cookeville elementary schools K-4 schools. The plan was not fully approved until the 1990s and the new site was chosen in 1994. The site elected was the Putnam Airport property on N. Washington Ave. The property, already owned by Putnam County, would save the county from buying any new expensive property and the airport at the site was hemmed in and too cramped to grow. Ground was broken on the $35 million new school project in the fall of 1994, and the building was completed for the 1996-1997 school year. Demographics According to the school's website, the demographic breakdown of the student population (as of 2009) was as follows:About CHS * White – 89.8% * African American – 2.8% * Hispanic – 5.5% * Native American/Alaskan – 0.4% * Asian – 1.88% :Statistics as of 2012 Notable alumni *Robin Clark - early 1960s pop singer, known as Ilo Hershiser while attending school *Mack Brown - former college football coach for Texas Longhorns and University of Texas at Austin, member of the College Football Hall of Fame *Watson Brown - college football coach *Predrag Danilović - NBA basketball player *Rich Froning Jr. - Crossfit athlete References External links * Category:Public high schools in Tennessee Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Tennessee Category:Schools in Putnam County, Tennessee ","title":"Cookeville High School"},{"id":"30010737","title":"Coming Home (Diddy – Dirty Money song)"},{"id":"30010758","text":"Manookian is an Armenian surname.

Due to their dynamic role within the ECM they are considered matricellular proteins. Background The acronym CCN is derived from the first three members of the family discovered, namely CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61 or CCN1), CTGF (connective tissue growth factor or CCN2), and NOV (nephroblastoma overexpressed or CCN3). Together with three Wnt-induced secreted proteins, they comprise the CCN family of matricellular proteins. These proteins have now been renamed CCN1-6 by international consensus. Members of the CCN protein family are characterized by having four conserved cysteine-rich domains, which include the insulin-like growth factor-binding domain (IGFBP), the Von Willebrand factor type C domain (VWC), the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR), and a C-terminal domain (CT) with a cysteine knot motif. CCN proteins have been shown to play important roles in many cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, and senescence. They are also involved in biological processes including angiogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis, wound healing and tumorigenesis. CCN proteins likely constitute a hub for the coordination of cell signaling and communication. Members The CCN protein family includes the following six proteins: * CCN1: CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61) * CCN2: CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) * CCN3: NOV (nephroblastoma overexpressed) * CCN4: WISP1 (WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein-1) * CCN5: WISP2 (WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein-2) * CCN6: WISP3 (WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein-3) References Further reading Satoshi Kubota, Masaharu Takigawa (2013) CCN family acting throughout the body: recent research developments.

Pettibone (born July 19, 1990) is an American former professional baseball pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2013–14. His father, Jay, was a starting pitcher for the Minnesota Twins. After signing with the Phillies in 2008, Pettibone methodically progressed through their farm system, generally spending about one season at each level until 2012, when he advanced to the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs after having spent the majority of that season with the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils. Early in 2013, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with the Phillies before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which the Phillies precautionarily did not use him for the remainder of the season. Pettibone began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of the Phillies starting rotation, making two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list. Early life Pettibone was born July 19, 1990 in Placentia, California, and grew up predominantly in Yorba Linda, California. He has two siblings; his father, Jay, played six seasons of professional baseball, including four appearances with the Minnesota Twins. The younger Pettibone attended Esperanza High School in Anaheim, California, and played baseball and basketball there prior to graduating in 2008. After graduation, he planned to play college baseball for the University of Southern California Trojans; however, the Phillies subsequently drafted Pettibone, leaving him to decide between playing college or professional baseball. In an effort to sway him to join the Phillies, scout Darrell Conner had Phillies pitchers Cole Hamels and Kyle Kendrick call Pettibone to share their experiences in deciding when to sign a professional contract, and ultimately, Pettibone agreed to a contract with the Phillies that included a signing bonus. Professional career Minor leagues (2008–2012) Pettibone was selected in the third round (110th overall) of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. That year, he started his professional career as a member of the Gulf Coast League Phillies, with whom he made only one appearance, allowing two unearned runs in one inning, and thus receiving the loss. At the conclusion of the season, he participated in the Florida Instructional League (FIL). In 2009, he played for the Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York–Penn League (Single-A short season). In June, he made three starts and compiled an 0.56 earned run average (ERA) in them, which helped him earn NY-Penn player of the week honors for June 22–28. Overall, he went 2–4 in nine games (eight starts) with a 5.35 ERA and thirty-six strikeouts in 35 innings, and again participated in the FIL at the end of the season. Pettibone’s steady advancement through the minor league system continued in 2010, when he pitched with the Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League (Single-A). With Lakewood, he allowed three or fewer earned runs in all but four of his 23 starts, and had a particularly strong second half of the season, posting a 2.41 ERA. Cumulatively, Pettibone finished ninth in the league with a 3.49 ERA, posted a win-loss record of 8–6, and threw a total of 131 innings. He pitched for the Clearwater Threshers of the Florida State League (Single-A advanced) the next year, and had a strong season, leading the league in innings pitched (161, tying for second place in starts (27), and finishing with the fifth-best ERA (2.96). Pettibone also was named a league all star, and the Phillies' minor league pitcher of the week in late April. At the conclusion of the season, Baseball America rated him the Phillies' fourth-best prospect. Pettibone split 2012 between the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils (Eastern League) and the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs (International League), earning a promotion to the latter in July. He posted an aggregate ERA of 3.10, to complement his 13–8 record in 159 innings pitched. Again, Baseball America ranked Pettibone as the Phillies' fourth-best prospect at the conclusion of the season, his last spent solely in the minor leagues. Philadelphia Phillies (2013–2014) 2013 season Philadelphia Phillies in 2013 Entering the Phillies' 2013 season, despite Pettibone’s quick ascension through the minor leagues and strong performance late in 2012 for the Triple-A IronPigs, he was considered to be behind Tyler Cloyd, Adam Morgan, and Ethan Martin on the organizational depth chart for starting pitchers. Pettibone began the year with Lehigh Valley, and despite a 7.71 ERA in his first three starts, the Phillies called him up to make his major league debut, admittedly \\"sooner than ... anticipated\\", according to Pettibone. He made that debut on April 22, 2013, starting for the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park against the Pittsburgh Pirates, pitching 5 innings, striking out six, while reaching base on a walk and scoring a run for Philadelphia; he earned a no decision in the Phillies' 3–2 defeat of the Pittsburgh Pirates. He remained in the starting rotation for the next several months, but in July, the Phillies ended his season due to an inflamed rotator cuff. In total, his numbers were commensurate with those he posted in the minor leagues – 18 starts, 5–4 record, 4.04 ERA, 100 innings pitched. 2014 season Although to remain a viable candidate to pitch in the Phillies rotation he needed to regain complete health, Pettibone began the 2014 Phillies season's spring training with more shoulder discomfort. Although the issue was not structural according to an MRI, it was disconcerting to the Phillies, as he was a young pitcher. Ultimately, the discomfort kept him from remaining a competitor for a spot in the back of the Phillies' rotation, and he began the season in the minor leagues. However, he was the first pitcher to be called up from the minor leagues to make a start for the Phillies in 2014, serving as a spot starter while Cole Hamels recovered from injury. He made two starts before being demoted back to the minor leagues. His injury woes subsequently continued; he was diagnosed with a SLAP tear, and though he declined surgery, he received a cortisone injection and was placed on the disabled list to rest. Todd Zolecki, the Phillies beat writer for MLB.com, noted, \\"Pettibone’s shoulder is a legitimate concern because this is the third time he has had to stop pitching in less than a year because of it. He finished last season on the disabled list before falling behind schedule in Spring Training because of shoulder pain.\\" On June 18, 2014, he underwent season-ending surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews to repair his SLAP tear. 2015 season Pettibone began the 2015 season on the 15-day disabled list to continue recovery from his shoulder surgery. Chicago Cubs On February 1, 2016, Pettibone signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. An invite to spring training was also included. He was released on April 27, 2016. New Britain Bees On March 24, 2017, Pettibone signed with the New Britain Bees of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He re-signed with the club in early 2018. Pettibone was released on May 10, 2018. Scouting report Although Pettibone was not projected to have the highest potential of any Phillies pitching prospect, some talent evaluators thought he had the highest floor (i.e., the worst-case scenario in terms of his development), and these evaluations were confirmed by his rookie season. As such, he projected to be a decent back-of-the-rotation starter. He throws three pitches, including a fastball that, while predominantly around , can reach . Secondarily, he throws a changeup, which Eric Longenhagen called his \\"best offering\\" because it \\"features good fade and arm speed.\\" When he first reached the major leagues, scouts thought he threw either curveball and slider, but upon reaching the major leagues, they determined he threw both a slider and a cutter, which move similarly and can \\"induce weak contact and maybe miss some bats if it's thrown in the right spot.\\" Ultimately, Pettibone's long-term effectiveness hinges on whether he could remain healthy.

This spell consists of a very large illustration, made up of a number of smaller images and texts, many of which derive from the older Coffin Texts. The purpose of this spell is to collect together the magical aids which were required for a burial, and also to perpetuate the protective funerary rituals. Some of these texts were also used on coffins, or on mud bricks placed in niches in the walls of a high-status funeral chamber.Taylor 2010, p.147–8 :153A and 153B both deal with the risk of being caught in a trap, a giant net which stretches between heaven and earth. :154 'For not letting the corpse perish'; this spell describes the decomposition of the body, but assures the deceased that they will triumph over it. :155 For a djed pillar amulet.Taylor 2010, p.128 :156 For an Isis knot amulet. :157 For an amuletic golden vulture collar.Taylor 2010, p.131 :158 For an amuletic golden falcon collar. :159 For a papyrus column amulet. :160 For a papyrus column amulet. :161 Describes how the four winds are released through openings in the sky to give the dead person the breath of life.

This spell invokes the power of Thoth in order to ensure the mummy of the deceased is protected by a large number of gods and spirits, who are similar in appearance to the fearsome guardians of the gates, caverns and mounds mentioned in earlier spells.Taylor 2010, p.190,199 :185 A hymn to Osiris.Taylor 2010, p.252 :189 For not eating faeces or drinking urine.

Actress Stella Stevens made her film debut in Say One for Me and received the Golden Globe Award in 1960 for New Star of the Year-Actress for this film. Plot In the middle of New York's theater district sits Father Conroy's parish, where entertainers often attend his services. His parishioners include Holly LeMaise, whose dad Harry was an old vaudevillian. Holly takes a job as a showgirl in a nightclub to pay the medical bills when her father falls ill. The featured entertainer at the club is Tony Vincent, a playboy whose romantic advances Holly wards off. But soon she develops feelings for him. Father Conroy befriends the former songwriter Phil Stanley, whose alcoholism and hard times have left him playing piano in Tony's act. The priest annoys Tony by seemingly interfering with Holly's personal life and now Phil's as well. Tony lands a job at a Miami hotel and tries to manipulate Holly into going along. As a charity event, Father Conroy organizes a big show that will be on nationwide TV. Tony, having lost the Miami job, desperately wants to perform on it. To prove his true intent to Holly, the priest offers to book Tony on television provided he tells Holly their relationship is over. Holly is shocked when he accepts. When it's his turn to sing, Tony's guilty conscience gives him a change of heart. He gives up his time on the TV show to Phil, who has written a new song. Father Conroy is pleased, and soon finds himself officiating at Holly's and Tony's wedding.

On June 18, 1959, Say One for Me had its premiere at Buffalo, New York. The event formed part of fund raising activities for Buffalo Boy’s Town run by Father Kelliher. There was also a gala benefit premier at the Pantages Theatre (Hollywood) on Hollywood Boulevard on the same day with the proceeds going to the Daniel Freeman Hospital, Inglewood and the Jesuit Scholasticata. In addition on June 20, the Fox Theater in El Centro, Southern California, showed the film and personal appearances were made by Bing Crosby, Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, and Ricardo Montalbán. This was part of a benefit for Our Lady of Guadalupe Church and parish in El Centro, organized by Father Victor Salandini, and $7000 was raised. On June 28, 1959, a 30th anniversary celebration took place at the Fox Theater in San Francisco (opened June 28, 1929) with a special advance screening of Say One for Me. Reception Variety was not impressed. \\"Basic idea in Robert O’Brien’s story probably had potentialities. It’s a “Going My Way” sort of affair with Bing Crosby again as a priest with his target shifted from juvenile roughnecks to show business delinquents. But something went wrong in the development; the entertainment values are short of impressive and the boxoffice will have to depend on Crosby and Debbie Reynolds as the marquee names...Crosby turns in a curiously inhibited performance. He plays the role tight, not at all like the free-wheeling, leisurely-paced Crosby of yore, but the voice is still there...\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times had some kind words.\\"...It is a pleasant show-world entertainment, this obvious “Say One for Me,” full of pretty girls with shapely legs, a few song numbers (two sung by Bing) and religious images. Robert O’Brien has contributed a screen play that is loaded with slang. Broadway gags that are easily comprehended and not too much clerical sentiment....As for Bing—well, he’s just about as usual, a little less lively, perhaps, a little older looking, but still casual and sincere. He’ll never make Monsignor. He’ll always be a parish priest, whenever he turns his collar backward, because you always sense a sport shirt underneath.\\" The Hollywood Citizen News review was direct in its appraisal. \\"A pleasant, if sometimes monotonous, photodrama with music . . . For visual appeal, this new 20th. Century-Fox film, in color and CinemaScope, is a world- beater. . . A handsome production from start to finish, it misses only in the departments of story, direction and acting, three important categories, nonetheless.\\" The film was a surprise success doing good business everywhere it opened. Musical numbers All the songs were written by Jimmy Van Heusen (music) and Sammy Cahn (lyrics). Lionel Newman conducted the musical backing for the film and he was nominated for an Oscar for \\"Best Scoring of a Musical Picture\\" but was unsuccessful. *\\"Say One for Me\\" - Sung by Bing Crosby and Debbie Reynolds *\\"You Can't Love Them All\\" - Sung by Debbie Reynolds and Robert Wagner *\\"You Can't Love Them All\\" (reprise 1) - Danced by Robert Wagner and Chorus Girls *\\"The Girl Most Likely To Succeed\\" - Sung and Danced by Debbie Reynolds and Robert Wagner *\\"You Can't Love Them All\\" (reprise 2) - Performed by Orchestra and Chorus *\\"I Couldn't Care Less\\" - Sung by Bing Crosby *\\"Cha Cha Choo Choo\\" - Sung and Danced by Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner and Chorus Girls *\\"The Night That Rock And Roll Died\\" - Danced by Robert Wagner *\\"The Secret of Christmas\\" - Played on a piano and Sung by Ray Walston *\\"Say One for Me\\" (reprise) - Sung by Bing Crosby *\\"The Night That Rock And Roll Died\\" - Sung by Judy Harriet (dubbed by Rosemary June) (In an interview at Disney's D23 Expo 2015 on August 16, 2015, performer Judy Harriet confirmed that her voice was not dubbed in the song; but that it was her own performance that appears on screen) *\\"The Secret of Christmas\\" (reprise) - Sung by Bing Crosby, Debbie Reynolds, Robert Wagner and Chorus.

Life  According to some sources he was a member of the Bosnian Hranušić family, released slave and adopted son of Pasha Yiğit Bey. That is disputed with opinion that Pasha Yigit Bey was indeed a biological father of Ishak Bey. Ishak was appointed ruler by Porte at the time of the conquest of Foča, Čajniče, Pljevlja and Nevesinje in today's Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1420 Ishak Bey organized a successful campaign in Bosnia to support Sandalj's struggle against his enemies. He executed Sandalj's opponent Petar Pavlovic and then Ishak Bey divided conquered territory with Sandalj. In attempt to relieve Ottoman pressure during the Siege of Thessalonica Venice inspired Gjon Kastrioti to rebel against Ottomans in 1428. After Ottomans captured Thessalonica in April 1430 their forces led by Ishak bey captured most of Gjon's land. He positioned Ottoman garrison in two Gjon's castles and destroyed rest of them. In December 1434 during an Albanian revolt he marched in south-central Albania but was defeated by Gjergj Arianiti. Contemporary sources from the senate of Ragusa mention that many Ottoman soldiers were captured, while Ishak Bey escaped with a small group. In 1439, when he was returning from his trip to Mecca, he was ordered by the sultan to join forces of Şihabeddin Pasha and besiege Novo Brdo, important fortified mining town of Serbian Despotate. On 6 August 1439 the Ottoman forces under Ishak-Beg defeated forces of Serbian Despotate in a battle fought near Novo Brdo. In November 1443 he commanded one of Ottoman armies during the Battle of Niš which ended with Ottoman defeat. Sultan appointed Himmetizade Nesuh Bey to be the new ruler of Bosansko Krajište in period between 1439 and 1454 when Isa- Beg Ishaković, Ishak Bey's son and ruler of Skopsko Krajište took over control over Bosansko Krajište also for period 1454—1463. His grandson Gazi Mehmed Bey Isabegović aka Čelebi was sanjak-bey of Bosnian Sanjak in period 1484–1485 and sanjak-bey of Sanjak of Herzegovina in period 1507-1510 and 1513-1515. He built the Ishak Bey Mosque in Skopje, where his tomb is also located.

Motivations  The monasteries, being landowners who never died and whose property was therefore never divided among inheritors (as happened to the land of neighboring secular land owners), tended to accumulate and keep considerable lands and properties - which aroused resentment and made them vulnerable to governments confiscating their properties at times of religious or political upheaval, whether to fund the state or to conduct land reform. Monasteries are most likely to undergo such a fate when coming under a Protestant or secularist regime. However, Catholic monarchs and governments are also known to have taken such steps at some times and places. Similar confiscations also happened in Buddhist countries. There are also known cases of specific monastic orders being suppressed by the Catholic Church itself, such as the suppression of the Jesuati by Pope Clement IX in 1668 or the (temporary) suppression of the Jesuits in 1759 (though the Order was eventually restored, many of the properties confiscated from the Jesuits were not given back). Additionally, there were cases of specific monasteries at various times and places being disbanded as a result of power struggles within the Catholic Church. For example, the Cârța Monastery in Transylvania was disbanded in 1494 by the apostolic legate Ursus of Ursinis; the monastery at Igreja de São Cristóvão de Rio Mau in Portugal was dissolved in 1443 and its assets passed to the Monastery of St. Simon of Junqueira, located close-by. It can be noted that the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England - a major act which marked King Henry VIII's break with the Catholic Church - was preceded a few years before by the smaller dissolution of some English monasteries and nunneries in the wake of the Littlemore Priory scandals; this earlier dissolution had been carried on within the Catholic Church, specifically authorized by a Papal bull.  Suppression by place   America   California  After Mexico gained independence from Spain, in the 1830s there was a move to secularize the monastic Spanish missions in California, then part of Mexico. As with other such cases, the missions were considered to have gained too much land and power, and had been very dominant in the society of Spanish-ruled California. Mexico The Calles Law (), or Law for Reforming the Penal Code was enacted in Mexico in 1926, under the presidency of Plutarco Elías Calles,Gonzales, Michael J., The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1940, p. 203, UNM Press, 2002 with the proclaimed aim of enforcing Separation of Church and State as set out in Article 130 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917. Among other acts against the Catholic Church, the Calles Law caused the outlawing of religious orders, depriving the Church of property rights and extensive closure of monasteries, convents, and religious schools.  Asia   China  In 845 the Chinese Emperor Wuzong of Tang suppressed thousands of Buddhist monasteries and confiscated their considerable properties. The Emperor's combined economic and religious motives for this act have many similarities to those of Western rulers taking a similar step towards Catholic or Orthodox Monasteries.  Mongolia  Like Buddhist and Christian monasteries elsewhere, the Mongolian monasteries have since the 16th century acquired riches and secular dependents, gradually increasing their wealth and power. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Outer Mongolia had 583 monasteries and temple complexes, which controlled an estimated 20 percent of the country's wealth. Following the Mongolian Revolution of 1921, authorities of the new Mongolian People's Republic entered into a prolonged struggle with the Buddhist faith in general and the monasteries in particular. In 1938 – amid accusations that the church and monasteries were trying to cooperate with the Japanese, who were promoting a pan-Mongol puppet state – this culminated with the remaining monasteries being dissolved, their property seized, and their monks secularized, interned or executed. Those monastic buildings that had not been destroyed were taken over to serve as local government offices or schools. Only the Gandan Monastery, with a community of 100 monks, was kept open in Ulaanbaatar as the country's sole monastery – more for international display than functionality. Following the Mongolian Revolution of 1990 some monasteries were re-opened.  Europe   Austria  The Edict on Idle Institutions was one of more than 10,000 ordinances issued by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor pertaining to religious issues. Promulgated in 1780, it outlawed contemplative monastic orders. The act permitted only monastic orders that dealt with teaching, nursing and other practical work within the Holy Roman Empire. The number of monks (whom the Emperor called \\"shaven-headed creatures whom the common people worship on bended knees\\")By Frank Tallett and Nicholas Atkin, Priests, Prelates and People: A History of European Catholicism Since 1750 (London and New York: I. B. Tauris, 2004), 12. dropped from 65,000 to 27,000. The Holy Roman Empire also expropriated the monasteries and took their money to pay ordinary priests more. The edict fits in with Joseph's ecclesiastical reforms, in which he sought to control the church in Austria and the Empire and saw it as an arm of the state.  Belgium (Austrian Netherlands)  Emperor Joseph II's Edict on Idle Institutions was applied also in the Austrian Netherlands (present-day Belgium), reducing the number of monasteries there. A decade later, in the course of the French Revolution in 1794, French armies overran the same territory, and on October 1, 1795 it was annexed to the Republic (including territories that were never under Habsburg rule, like the Bishopric of Liège). Thereupon, the French Revolution's militant anticlerical policies, already implemented in France itself, were applied to this new territory - which included the dissolution of convents and monasteries as well as confiscation of ecclesiastical properties and the separation of Church and State.  Denmark  In Denmark in 1528, King Frederick I of Denmark confiscated 15 of the houses of the wealthiest monasteries and convents. Further laws under his successor over the course of the 1530s banned the friars, and forced monks and nuns to transfer title to their houses to the Crown, which passed them out to supportive nobles, who soon acquired former monastic lands. Danish monastic life was to vanish in a way identical to that of Sweden. However, most monks and nuns by far were allowed to stay in their monasteries and convents (except the grey friars). Only when the last monk or nun had died was the monastery added to the property of the Crown. Thus, except for more fierce procedures followed especially by bishop Peder Palladius on Zealand, the Reformation became a relatively bloodless affair in Denmark.  England, Ireland, and Wales  The Dissolution of the Monasteries was the administrative and legal process between 1536 and 1541 by which Henry VIII disbanded monasteries, priories, convents and friaries in England, Wales and Ireland; appropriated their income, disposed of their assets and provided for their former members. He was given the authority to do this in England and Wales by the Act of Supremacy, passed by Parliament in 1534, which made him Supreme Head of the Church in England, thus separating England from Papal authority; and by the First Suppression Act (1536) and the Second Suppression Act (1539). Although some monastic foundations dated back to Anglo-Saxon England, the overwhelming majority of the 825 religious communities dissolved by Henry VIII owed their existence to the wave of monastic enthusiasm that had swept England and Wales in the 11th and 12th centuries; in consequence of which religious houses in the 16th century controlled appointment to about a third of all parish benefices, and disposed of about half of all ecclesiastical income. The dissolution still represents the largest legally enforced transfer of property in English history since the Norman Conquest. France In an attempt to address the financial crisis, the Assembly declared, on 2 November 1789, that the property of the Church was “at the disposal of the nation.”National Assembly legislation cited in John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. They used this property to back a new currency, the assignats. The nation had now thus also taken on the responsibility of the Church, which included paying the clergy, caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned.John McManners, The French Revolution and the Church, 27. In December, the Assembly began to sell the lands to the highest bidder to raise revenue, effectively decreasing the value of the assignats by 25 percent in two years.Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 61. In autumn of 1789, legislation abolished monastic vows and on 13 February 1790 all religious orders were dissolved.Emmet Kennedy, A Cultural History of the French Revolution, 148. Monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life and a small percentage did eventually marry.Censer and Hunt, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution, 92. Italy Bernardo Tanucci, who was the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the second half of the 18th century, was a most zealous regalist, seeking to establish the supremacy of a modernized State over the Catholic Church. Among other measures undertaken under the principles of enlightened absolutism, he closed convents and monasteries, distributing their lands among noble supporters of the Monarch, thus strengthening the royal presence in the Regno. Revenues of vacant bishoprics and abbeys went to the crown.  Germany and Austria  In 1521, Martin Luther published 'De votis monasticis' ('On the monastic vows'), a treatise which declared that the monastic life had no scriptural basis, was pointless and also actively immoral in that it was not compatible with the true spirit of Christianity. Luther also declared that monastic vows were meaningless and that no one should feel bound by them. Luther, a former Augustinian friar, found some comfort when these views had a dramatic effect: a special meeting of the German province of his order held the same year accepted them and voted that henceforth every member of the regular clergy should be free to renounce their vows, resign their offices and get married. At Luther's home monastery in Wittenberg all the friars, save one, did so. After the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the Protestant princes confiscated the estates of the monastic orders in their lands. Under the influence of Josephinism the laicisation of several monastic foundations was undertaken in Catholic parts of Germany, Austria and Hungary. The German mediatization - as the major territorial restructuring that took place between 1802 and 1814 in Germany and the surrounding region under the pressure of Napoleon Bonaparte's France, included a mass secularization of Catholic Church properties - prominently targeted monasteries as well as other Catholic Church properties. All of these had undergone secularization, i.s. \\"the transfer (of property) from ecclesiastical to civil possession or use.Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language, 1989.Derek Beales, Prosperity and Plunder. European Catholic Monasteries in the Age of Revolution, 1650–1815, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 59. Altogether, hundreds of monasteries and other Catholic religious foundations were closed. It has been said that the Final Recess of 1803 did to German land ownership what the Revolution had done to France.Whaley, J., Germany and the Holy Roman Empire (1493–1806), Oxford University Press, 2011, vol. 2, p. 623. Even where the monasteries and abbeys were not closed down altogether, with their lands taken away they had lost their means of subsistence. The page List of Christian monasteries in Germany enumerates both the monasteries which survived up to the present and those which were dissolved.  Netherlands  Following 1572, with the success of the Dutch Revolt and consolidation of the Dutch Republic, the Calvinist Church became the sole officially recognized Church in the Republic's entire territory. All properties of the Catholic Church were confiscated and all monasteries dissolved (with the sole exception of Maastricht and its immediate environs where a special exception was made in 1632). The former monastic premises were put to a variety of public and private uses. For example, the Great Abbey of Middelburg became the meeting hall of the States of Zealand and the St Agnes Convent in Rotterdam became the Prinsenhof, headquarters of the Admiralty of Rotterdam. Elsewhere, former monasteries were often made available as housing and workshops to the numerous Protestant refugees (estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000) who escaped or were expelled from the South Netherlands, which were overrun by the Spanish army and where the Catholic Church was triumphant. In particular, former monasteries were used as workshops for Protestant weavers displaced from such towns as Bruges and Ghent who re-established themselves in various cities of the Dutch Republic.The process of Catholic dispossession, monastic dissolution and re-use of the monastic premises was described by Jonathan Israel in \\"The Dutch Republic\\", Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995 Norway Poland See:Dissolution of monasteries under the Russian Partition (i.e., in Russian- ruled Poland in the early 19th century)  Portugal  After the Portuguese Civil War, a 28 May 1834 decree from Joaquim António de Aguiar nationalisated the land of over 500 monasteries.  Romania  The law on the secularization of monastery estates in Romania was proposed in December 1863 by Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza and approved by the Parliament of Romania. By its terms, the Romanian state confiscated the large estates owned by the Eastern Orthodox Church in Romania.  Russia  In 1917 the Bolsheviks confiscated, without compensation, the estates of the churches and the monasteries.  Scotland  Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries did not affect Scotland, then still a completely separate kingdom. In the Scottish Reformation of the 1560's, monasteries in Scotland were not dissolved, but allowed to die out with their monks. The Reformation's focus on the parish church as the centre of worship meant the abandonment of much of the complex religious provision of monasteries, as of chapelries and cathedrals - many of which were allowed to decay or, like the Cathedral at St. Andrews, were mined for dressed stone to be used in local houses.Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587, pp. 217–8. Dunfermline Abbey, one of the most well-known monasteries is Scotland, was sacked in March 1560 and largely ruined, though parts were later rebuilt and its church made into a parish church. The Cistercian Abbey of Dulce Cor, better known as Sweetheart Abbey, persisted longer than other Scottish monasteries. Starting in 1565, the Scottish crown placed the abbey under a series of commendatory abbots. The last Cistercian abbot was Gilbert Broun, S.O.Cist. (died 1612), who continued to uphold the Catholic faith long after the Reformation. He was charged several times with enticing to \\"papistrie\\" from 1578 to 1605, until finally he was arrested in 1605, in spite of the resistance of the whole countryside, and transported to Edinburgh, where he was tried and sentenced to exile. In 1624, the last of the monks died and the abbey buildings and land passed into the hands of Sir Robert Spottiswoode, son of the Archbishop of St Andrews, who assumed the title of Lord of New Abbey.  Spain  Between 1835 and 1837, a series of decrees from Juan Álvarez Mendizábal was published, which confiscated, without compensation, monastic land estates. Sweden In the Riksdag of Västerås in 1527, King Gustavus Vasa secured an edict of the Diet allowing him to confiscate any monastic lands he deemed necessary to increase royal revenues, and to allow the return of donated properties to the descendants of those who had donated them, should they wish to retract them. By the following Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden, Gustav gained large estates, as well as loyal supporters among the nobility who chose to use the permission to retract donations done by their families to the convents. The Swedish monasteries and convents were simultaneously deprived of their livelihoods. They were banned from accepting new novices, as well as forbidden to prevent their existing members from leaving if they wished to do so. However, the former monks and nuns were allowed to reside in the convent buildings for life on state allowance, and many of them consequently survived the Reformation for decades. The last of them was Vreta Abbey, where the last nuns died in 1582, and Vadstena Abbey, from which the last nuns emigrated in 1605 about half a century after the introduction of reformation. Switzerland In Switzerland, too, monasteries came under threat. In 1523 the government of the city-state of Zurich pressured nuns to leave their monasteries and marry, and followed up the next year by dissolving all monasteries in its territory, under the pretext of using their revenues to fund education and help the poor. The city of Basel followed suit in 1529 and Geneva adopted the same policy in 1530. An attempt was also made in 1530 to dissolve the famous Abbey of St. Gall, which was a state of the Holy Roman Empire in its own right, but this failed, and St. Gall has survived for another two and a half centuries. In 1798, under the impact of the French Revolution and German Mediatisation, the St. Gall was finally secularized, the Prince-Abbot's secular power was suppressed, and the monks were driven out and moved into other abbeys. However, the Catholic Church managed to retain control of the abbey church and a portion of the monastic buildings, which eventually became a separate Episcopal see in 1846. Further suppression There were other examples of suppression in Catholic and formerly Catholic countries, including: * The Laicisation of church land by the French monarchy * The confiscation of monastic property in Napoleonic and post-unification Italy * The German Mediatisation in the Napoleonic period * Suppression of the Society of Jesus in various countries in the late 18th century References Category:History of Catholic monasticism ","title":"Suppression of monasteries"},{"id":"30011164","text":"Ichneumenoptera is a genus of moths in the family Sesiidae.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The church stands a mile away from its parish, and shares its churchyard with the parish church of the adjoining village of Alvingham. Sharing a churchyard is unusual among English churches, but not unique. Another example is St Lawrence's Church, Evesham, which is also under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The reason in the cases of Alvingham and Evesham is the former existence of a monastery. St Mary's was the chapel for the Gilbertine Alvingham Priory which was sited adjacent to the parish church of Alvingham. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the chapel was given to the village of North Cockerington to serve as their parish church, because their own church was in a bad condition. The structure dates from the 11th century (which is earlier than the priory which was founded in the twelfth century). Additions and alterations were carried out in the late 12th century, in about 1300, and in the 14th century. The tower was added in the 19th century. The church was declared redundant in March 1981. Architecture Exterior St Mary's is constructed in a combination of greenstone, ironstone and limestone coursed rubble. The dressings are in limestone ashlar, there is some brickwork present, and part of the walls are rendered. The roofs are in lead and slate.

Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt and the Swedish Security Service (SÄPO) described the bombings as acts of terrorism. Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, an Iraqi-born Swedish citizen, is suspected of carrying out the bombing. According to investigations by FBI, the bombing would likely have killed between 30 and 40 people had it succeeded, and it is thought that al-Abdaly operated with a network. Europol categorized the attack as islamist terrorism.  Bombings  The first explosion occurred at 16:48 CET, when an Audi 80 Avant automobile exploded at the intersection of Olof Palmes gata and Drottninggatan. According to firefighters the car contained bottles of liquefied petroleum gas, which resulted in several more explosions. Two people at the site of the explosion were hospitalized with minor injuries. The second explosion occurred at about 17:00 CET at the intersection of Bryggargatan and Drottninggatan. A man’s body, with blast wounds on his abdomen, was discovered nearby. According to a police spokesman, the man blew himself up. According to Aftonbladet, he carried six pipe bombs; only one exploded, killing him. Near the man, a metal pipe and a rucksack filled with metal fasteners and an unknown substance (suspected to be an explosive) were found. According to witnesses, the bomber was \\"shouting something in Arabic\\" before detonating the bomb. Closed-circuit television footage of the second explosion was released the following day by Aftonbladet. At the time of the explosions, central Stockholm was filled with Christmas shoppers and thousands of people were in the vicinity. The Swedish Defence Research Agency reconstructed and tested the bombs and estimates that if all the bombs had worked the effect could have been similar to the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, where three people died and over a hundred people were injured.Interview with Swedish bomb expert, Svenska Dagbladet 2017-02-23 (in Swedish) Foreign Minister Bildt expressed his concern that if the attack had been successful, the result could have been \\"truly catastrophic.\\" The bombings followed a November increase in the terror- alert level in Sweden (from low to elevated) because of a \\"shift in activities among Swedish-based groups\\".  Email threat  About ten minutes before the explosions, a threatening email was sent to the Swedish Security Service and the Swedish news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå (TT). It referred to the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan and Swedish artist Lars Vilks' drawings of Muhammad as a roundabout dog: \\"Now your children, daughters and sisters will die in the same way our brothers and sisters die. Our actions will speak for themselves. As long as you don't end your war against Islam and degradation against the prophet and your foolish support for the pig [Lars] Vilks.\\" The email ended with a call to \\"all Mujahedin in Europe and Sweden. Now is the time to strike, wait no longer. Go forward with whatever you have, even if it is a knife, and I know you have more than a knife. Fear no one, don't fear prison, don't fear death.\\" Sound files in Swedish and Arabic were also included.  Investigation  Map of the area of the explosions A PMR radio with attached wires was found near the body, suggesting that the bomb was intended to be triggered remotely. The state prosecutor said the action was well organised. Swedish bombexperts consider the bombs amateurishly produced, without assistance of an experienced terrorist. The suspect was wearing a bomb belt, carried a large bomb and was holding a metal object resembling a pressure cooker. The prosecutor believed that the bomb exploded prematurely; he speculated that the suspect was on his way to Stockholm Central Station or Åhléns, a large department store in the area. News media reported that a woman \\"close to\\" the suspect was detained in a 4:00 raid of a Hässelby flat by the National Task Force, and a search warrant was issued under the UK Terrorism Act 2000 for a property in Bedfordshire the following day. On 13December, the SÄPO announced that seven explosive experts from the FBI would assist the investigation. Security services told TV4 that the suicide bomber's car contained a second pressure cooker bomb. Witnesses said that four days before the bombing, the man tried to buy aluminium powder in his parents' hometown of Tranås. Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå reported that a member of the Swedish Armed Forces warned an acquaintance in a message to avoid Drottninggatan several hours before the bombings: \\"If you can, avoid Drottninggatan today. A lot can happen there ... just so you know.\\" The Swedish Armed Forces denied prior knowledge of the attack, promising to investigate further, and the SÄPO launched an independent investigation. The newspaper Expressen later reported that several sources close to the investigation claimed a second government employee had advance information about the bombing. Terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish National Defence College said that he believed the perpetrator was not working alone. Background coughing heard on the audio message left by the perpetrator increased suspicions that the bomber had accomplices. Investigation revealed that the terrorist used at least three different passports to avoid raising red flags when traveling to the Middle East. Suspicions that al-Abdaly had an accomplice increased in January 2011, when the media reported that uncensored recordings of the terrorist's audio message were posted on YouTube the day after he died. Swedish TV4 then reported that Abdulwahab's wife, Mona Thwany, had uploaded the recordings to the couple's YouTube account.Mona: Det var jag som lade ut filen, Aftonbladet, 4 January 2011.  Suspect  Scene of the second explosion the day after the attack, seen from Drottninggatan Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly (12December 1981 – 11December 2010) was identified as the prime suspect. According to information from his Facebook profile and the muslima.com dating site (where he was looking for a second wife), he was a 28-year-old Iraqi Swede born in Baghdad who grew up in Tranås and was naturalized as a Swedish citizen in 1992. After completing secondary school in Sweden in 2001, al-Abdaly studied at the University of Bedfordshire and graduated with a degree in sports therapy in 2004. That year, he married a Swedish citizen with whom he had two daughters, born in 2007 and 2009, and a son born in 2010. At the time of the bombings, he was living with his wife in the Bury Park district of Luton, Bedfordshire. The Bury Park area has featured prominently in counter-terrorist investigations. His wife, who holds fundamentalist Islamic views, and he named their son Usama after Usama bin Laden. They returned to Sweden on 19November to visit relatives in Tranås. In 2007, he began travelling repeatedly to Jordan and Iraq. In 2008, traveled to Syria. Al-Abady collected new Swedish passports in 2001, 2007 and 2008, the last of which he claimed to have lost. During his stay in Britain, al-Abdaly lived in Luton for almost a decade. Reports indicated that he became more religious and more angry in the late 2000s. During Ramadan in 2007, after al- Abdaly tried to recruit other Muslims who shared his political views when he preached at the Luton mosque he stormed out when confronted about his beliefs and was forbidden to return. His Facebook profile was reported to contain a mixture of technophile and Islamic fundamentalist postings, peppering sentiments such as \\"I love my Apple iPad\\" with references to \\"the Islamic Caliphate state\\" and Yawm al-Qiyamah. Al-Abdaly also posted internet videos of Chechen fighters and abused Iraqi prisoners.  Reaction   Domestic  Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt held a press conference on 12December 2010, where he said: \\"Saturday's events in central Stockholm leads many people to ask whether Sweden has become less safe. What occurred is unwanted and unacceptable. We must safeguard the open society where people can live together side by side.\\" Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt posted a message on Twitter on 11December 2010: \\"Most worrying attempt at terrorist attack in crowded part of central Stockholm. Failed — but could have been truly catastrophic.\\" Swedish Security Service spokesman Mikael Gunnarsson said the agency did not increase the terror-threat level after the bombings: \\"And apart from the e-mail we didn't have any other indications or threats that this would happen.\\" Hassan Moussa, imam of the Stockholm Mosque, condemned \\"all forms of attacks, violence, fears and threats against innocent people, whatever the motive or pretext\\" in a statement provided to Swedish news agency TT. On 14December, he issued a fatwa against the suicide bomber: \\"It's forbidden to approve what has happened or try to justify it. Those who accept it or justify it are as guilty as the perpetrator himself.\\" Muslim Council of Sweden chairman Omar Mustafa said in an interview, \\"This is an attack on Sweden and on all Muslims in Sweden.\\" Ben Mahmoud Rahmeh, imam and chairman of the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe, and the Islamic Federation of Sweden issued a press release condemning the attacks: \\"Attacks like this have been carried out earlier in both Muslim and non-Muslim communities (such as in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, Spain and the UK) and then the Muslim scholars and theologians' position has been unanimously against such attacks. Also, important Islamic institutions and Muslim inter-governmental organisations, such as Al-Azhar University, the European Council for Fatwa, Organisation of the Islamic Conference, have all been united in that all terrorist attacks against civilians and innocent people is strictly prohibited and that it is not permissible to oppress, harm or intimidate others.\\" After the press release was issued, the attack was condemned during Friday prayers at the Stockholm Mosque. Alexandra Brunell, secretary for Sweden Democrats party leader Jimmie Åkesson reacted to the event by tweeting \\"Äntligen\\" (\\"Finally\\") while another SD politician, member of parliament William Petzäll posted \\"I hate to say it, but didn´t we say so?\\"http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sd-gjorde-bort-sig-pa-twitter-om- terrorspekulationer/ International * Australia: Minister for Foreign Affairs Kevin Rudd issued a statement: \\"I express grave concern at the apparent terrorist attack in a central Stockholm yesterday evening (local time).

I've today been in contact with my Swedish colleague, Carl Bildt, and assured him that Denmark in the fight against terrorism stands closely with our brotherland.\\" * Finland: Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Stubb expressed his concern about the bombings, pointing out that nothing similar had ever happened in the Nordic countries and declaring his support for the efforts of the Swedish government. * Germany: Federal Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle issued a press release: \\"I condemn yesterday’s suicide attack in Stockholm, in the heart of a European capital.

The Seventh Fairy Maiden, uses the name Yu Xiaoqi, daughter of the Jade Emperor, comes to Earth to meet her second sister's former love, scholar Lao Xinrong. Not knowing Xiaoqi's intention, the Jade Emperor saw this as an opportunity for Xiaoqi to learn more about humans because she is very disobedient and carefree compared to the other daughters. The Jade Emperor chose the Dong family, seeing that Dong is a good person and hopes that the family can guide Xiaoqi to becoming more filial. Fortunately, Dong happens to be one of Lao's students and Xiaoqi is able to get to know more about Lao and Xiaoqi's sister's love even more.

The Chilean playing season runs from September to December. There are at least 10 cricket clubs and 2 turf pitches in Chile. History Cricket is first recorded as having been played in Chile at Valparaíso in 1829 between the crew of two Royal Navy vessels. The countries oldest cricket club, Valparaíso Cricket Club was formed in 1860 and hosted regular matches throughout the 19th and early 20th century between the clubs of Concepción and the Prince of Wales Country Club. These teams mostly contained British expatriates. In 1893, Chile played its first international match against Argentina, a fixture in which it took the Argentine team 3 days to cross the Andes to reach Santiago to fulfill the fixture. The exodus of British expatriates in the post war years led to a rapid decline in the sport in Chile. From the 1960s onward, the game was just about kept alive by the few expatriates that remained. In 2001, Chile were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. They made their debut in an ICC event in the 2006 Americas Championship Division Three. Chile have played in this division ever since and will played in it once again in 2011. The game in Chile has an ambitious development programme to take the game to the local population, which has focused on a large part to introducing the sport to schools, with an estimated 3,000 children having been introduced to cricket. Governing body The Chilean Cricket Association is the official governing body of cricket in Chile. Its current headquarters is in Santiago. Asociación Chilena de Cricket is Chile's representative at the International Cricket Council. Domestic competitions The main domestic tournament in Chile is the Metropolitan Cup, which contains 6 teams. This competition has been held since the 2001/02 season. There is a second division which contains 4 teams. Alongside this is the Condaroo 20/20 League, which is played in the Twenty20 format.

It is produced monthly during term time (previously fortnightly) and is available as a paper edition distributed across University halls of residence, academic, and administrative buildings. The paper follows a traditional newspaper layout: the front portion of the newspaper is devoted to news issues, particularly those concerning students at the University. History The Spark was established in 1934 as The Shell, and varied considerably in design, style and quality with the change in the demographic of the University, the advancement in printing and editorial techniques, and the change in political orientation of the editorial team. In 1984, the newspaper changed format to a more magazine-style publication, rebranding itself as the short-lived Splat, before changing again to Spark* in 1988. Spark* reverted to a newspaper format in 1990, under the title Spark. At this point the newspaper was published weekly. In 2006, the then Reading University Students' Union (RUSU) President Dave Lewis took the decision to have Spark* published fortnightly, to reduce costs and to give the volunteer staff more time between issues whilst completing their degrees. This move coincided with a move to printing in full colour and the rebranding as Spark*. In recent years, The Spark has been aiming to increase the quality of the newspaper, particularly following a scathing Independent article in 2005, where a former Varsity editor described The Spark as 'about as visually appealing as a punch in the retina'. Since then, the newspaper has had a major redesign by University Typography and Graphic Communication students, and has upgraded its design software to Adobe InDesign CS3 thanks to a donation by the University's annual fund. Awards The Spark is frequently nominated by its editorial team for the Guardian Student Media Awards in a number of categories. 2010 was a particularly strong year for Spark*, beginning with two writers, Georgina Mills and Marcus Greenslade, winning first and second prizes respectively in Up to Speed's student journalism competition. In November 2010, The Sparks (then known as 'Spark*') music editor Kate Allen received the gong for best student writer at the Record of the Day Awards 2010, which recognise contributions to music journalism. Kate was heavily commended by The Guardians Film and Music editor, Michael Hann.

However, upon closer inspection, the ball is simply an orthodox backspinner, a very common delivery that has been bowled by finger spinners as long as cricket has been played.[Brian Wilkins \\"The Bowler's Art\\"] The delivery was renamed in the Indian Cricket League by Saqlain Mushtaq. At that time Saqlain played for the Lahore Badshahs. The first person to face the teesra or jalebi was Russel Arnold of Sri Lanka when he was correctly given LBW by the umpire. He was also the first person to get out at the hands of the teesra. He got out the fourth time a teesra had ever been bowled.Arnold adjudged Plumb to miraculous Teesra by Saqi The teesra made the news in the build-up to the first Test between England and Pakistan in 2012, when Saeed Ajmal claimed he would introduce the delivery into his repertoire. Saeed Ajmal took a match haul of 10 for 97 and became the fifth bowler to pick up seven leg before wicket dismissals in a match.  The delivery  The delivery is similar to a slider (which is used by a wrist spinner). The ball is held by an off-spinner in his normal action but instead of twisting the arm at the point of the delivery, the bowler simply does not roll his fingers down the back of the ball. The delivery looks like it will turn a lot but it doesn't turn at all. This is a good way of deceiving the batsman.  The name  The name teesra is commonly used by Saqlain Mushtaq. It originated from an older delivery, the doosra which meant the \\"other one\\" or \\"second one\\" in Hindi, and Urdu, Saqlain decided to call it the teesra meaning the \\"third one\\". The name jalebi was introduced by commentators as soon as the delivery was bowled. A jalebi is a sweet commonly eaten in Indian subcontinent. However the name \\"backspinner\\" is by far the more common name that describes accurately the spin on the ball as it travels through the air.  Usage  So far this delivery has been used for well over a hundred years, but Saqlain has stated that the teesra is still a work in progress and that he wants to hone the delivery so that the batsman become even more confused about where the ball is going to spin to and whether it will spin at all. Saeed Ajmal claimed to have learned this art and has used it occasionally in the 2011 World Cup and after.

For example, a fiscal policy maker may have a prediction as to the value of the fiscal multiplier—the ratio of the effect of a government spending change on GDP to the size of the government spending change—but is not likely to know the exact value of this ratio. Similar uncertainty may surround the magnitude of effect of a change in the monetary base or its growth rate upon some target variable, which could be the money supply, the exchange rate, the inflation rate, or GDP. There are several policy implications of multiplier uncertainty: (1) If the multiplier uncertainty is uncorrelated with additive uncertainty, its presence causes greater cautiousness to be optimal (the policy tools should be used to a lesser extent). (2) In the presence of multiplier uncertainty, it is no longer redundant to have more policy tools than there are targeted economic variables. (3) Certainty equivalence no longer applies under quadratic loss: optimal policy is not equivalent to a policy of ignoring uncertainty. Effect of multiplier uncertainty on the optimal magnitude of policy For the simplest possible case, let P be the size of a policy action (a government spending change, for example), let y be the value of the target variable (GDP for example), let a be the policy multiplier, and let u be an additive term capturing both the linear intercept and all unpredictable components of the determination of y. Both a and u are random variables (assumed here for simplicity to be uncorrelated), with respective means Ea and Eu and respective variances \\\\sigma^2_a and \\\\sigma^2_u. Then :y = aP + u. Suppose the policy maker cares about the expected squared deviation of GDP from a preferred value y_d; then its loss function L is quadratic so that the objective function, expected loss, is given by: :\\\\text{E}L = \\\\text{E}(y-y_d)^2 = \\\\text{E}(aP + u - y_d)^2 = [\\\\text{E}(aP + u - y_d)]^2 + \\\\text{var} (aP + u - y_d) = [(\\\\text{E}a)P + \\\\text{E}u - y_d]^2 + P^2 \\\\sigma^2_a + \\\\sigma^2_u. where the last equality assumes there is no covariance between a and u. Optimizing with respect to the policy variable P gives the optimal value Popt: :P^{opt} = \\\\frac{(\\\\text{E}a)(y_d - \\\\text{E}u)}{(\\\\text{E}a)^2 + \\\\sigma^2_a}. Here the last term in the numerator is the gap between the preferred value yd of the target variable and its expected value Eu in the absence of any policy action. If there were no uncertainty about the policy multiplier, \\\\sigma^2_a would be zero, and policy would be chosen so that the contribution of policy (the policy action P times its known multiplier a) would be to exactly close this gap, so that with the policy action Ey would equal yd. However, the optimal policy equation shows that, to the extent that there is multiplier uncertainty (the extent to which \\\\sigma^2_a > 0), the magnitude of the optimal policy action is diminished. Thus the basic effect of multiplier uncertainty is to make policy actions more cautious, although this effect can be modified in more complicated models. Multiple targets or policy instruments The above analysis of one target variable and one policy tool can readily be extended to multiple targets and tools. In this case a key result is that, unlike in the absence of multiplier uncertainty, it is not superfluous to have more policy tools than targets: with multiplier uncertainty, the more tools are available the lower expected loss can be driven. Analogy to portfolio theory There is a mathematical and conceptual analogy between, on the one hand, policy optimization with multiple policy tools having multiplier uncertainty, and on the other hand, portfolio optimization involving multiple investment choices having rate-of-return uncertainty. The usages of the policy variables correspond to the holdings of the risky assets, and the uncertain policy multipliers correspond to the uncertain rates of return on the assets. In both models, mutual fund theorems apply: under certain conditions, the optimal portfolios of all investors regardless of their preferences, or the optimal policy mixes of all policy makers regardless of their preferences, can be expressed as linear combinations of any two optimal portfolios or optimal policy mixes. Dynamic policy optimization The above discussion assumed a static world in which policy actions and outcomes for only one moment in time were considered. However, the analysis generalizes to a context of multiple time periods in which both policy actions take place and target variable outcomes matter, and in which time lags in the effects of policy actions exist. In this dynamic stochastic control context with multiplier uncertainty, a key result is that the \\"certainty equivalence principle\\" does not apply: while in the absence of multiplier uncertainty (that is, with only additive uncertainty) the optimal policy with a quadratic loss function coincides with what would be decided if the uncertainty were ignored, this no longer holds in the presence of multiplier uncertainty.

Personal life and education Hyman was educated at University College London and King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a PhD in 1987. Hyman was married to American scientist Suzanne Eaton (1959–2019); the couple had two children.ASCB Profile: Tony Hyman. In: ASCB-Newsletter, November 2012, S. 41 (online). Research Hyman has focused his career on examining microtubules and how these structures of the cytoskeleton control: cell division, mitotic spindle position, and cell polarity. Hyman's research has identified how microtubules are made into cellular structures and how they are broken down. While at King's College, Cambridge, Hyman worked under the supervision of John White and was a key researcher in Sydney Brenner's C. elegans group. Using microscopy and microsurgery, he examined the placement of cell axes during early cell division of C.elegans embryos. Hyman presented new findings about mechanisms of rotation by cutting microtubules with a laser beam. Hyman demonstrated that pulling forces acting from the posterior cortex on microtubules drives spindle rotation. At the University of California, San Francisco, Hyman investigated the interaction between chromosomes and microtubules that create the mitotic forces that separate chromosomes in the lab of Tim Mitchison. He also created a number of tools that are used today: * atypical hydrolysable GTP analog GMPCPP * various fluorescent tubulin derivatives. * assays for motors and microtubule polarity While at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Hyman along with Rebecca Heald and Eric Karsenti combined their work to create an impact on the current understanding of how the meiotic spindle self assembles. Hyman created his first independent group at EMBL that discovered that the important factors in Xenopus egg extracts were the stabilizing protein, XMAP215 and the destabilizing protein, XKCM1. In 1999, Hyman became one of the four founding directors of Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics and was the Managing Director for the institute from 2010–2013. During his tenure at the MPI-CBG, Hyman and his lab members have focused on: * Cytoplasmic organization and how cells form non-membrane bound compartments * Size and scaling of the spindle, centrosomes, and other organelles * Spatial control of the microtubule cytoskeleton * Positioning of the spindle Hyman has worked on creating parts lists for cell division among human cells as part of the EU funded projects Mitocheck and MitoSys. Hyman is currently studying the mechanisms by which cells compartmentalize their biochemistry. Of his many contributions to the field of molecular biology, he is best known for two discoveries in particular: In 2000, his team pioneered the use of RNA interference to define the “parts lists” for different cytoplasmic processes. And in 2009, while teaching a physiology course in Woods Hole, he, together with Cliff Brangwynne and Frank Julicher, made a fundamental breakthrough by being the first to observe that compartments in cells can form by phase separation. Aberrant phase transitions within liquid-like compartments may underlie amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative and age-related diseases. Hyman’s current work focuses on the physical-chemical basis by which intrinsically disordered proteins phase separate. Using this knowledge, he is studying the roles of phase separation in physiology and disease.

Awards and honours In 2011, Hyman was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, Germany's most prestigious research award, for his work on microtubules and cell division. Hyman was elected a Member in 2000 of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2000 and was awarded its Gold Medal in 2003. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2007.

The goal of this process is to protect a video creator's intellectual property.  History  Indyk et al.P. Indyk, G. Iyengar, and N. Shivakumar. Finding pirated video sequences on the internet. Technical report, Stanford University, 1999. produced a video copy detection theory based on the length of the film; however, it worked only for whole films without modifications. When applied to short clips of a video, Idynk et al.'s technique does not detect that the clip is a copy. Later, Oostveen et al. introduced the concept of a fingerprint, or hash function, that creates a unique signature of the video based on its contents. This fingerprint is based on the length of the video and the brightness, as determined by splitting it into a grid. The fingerprint cannot be used to recreate the original video because it describes only certain features of its respective video. Some time ago, B.Coskun et al. presented two robust algorithms based on discrete cosine transform. Hampapur and Balle created an algorithm creating a global description of a piece of video based on the video's motion, color, space, and length. To look at the color levels of the image was thought, and for this reason, Li et al. created an algorithm that examines the colors of a clip by creating a binary signature get from the histogram of every frame. This algorithm, however, returns inconsistent results in cases in which a logo is added to the video, because the insertion of the logo's color elements adds false information that can confuse the system.  Techniques  Watermarked image  Watermarks  Watermarks are used to introduce an invisible signal into a video to ease the detection of illegal copies. This technique is widely used by photographers. Placing a watermark on a video such that it is easily seen by an audience allows the content creator to detect easily whether the image has been copied. The limitation of watermarks is that if the original image is not watermarked, then it is not possible to know whether other images are copies.  Content- based signature  Video copy detection. In this technique, a unique signature is created for the video on the basis of the video's content. Various video copy detection algorithms exist that use features of the video's content to assign the video a unique fingerprint. The fingerprint can be compared with other videos' fingerprints stored in a database. This type of algorithm has a significant problem: if various aspects of the videos' contents are similar, it is difficult for an algorithm to determine whether the video in question is a copy of the original or merely similar to it. In such a case (e.g., two distinct news broadcasts), the algorithm can return that the video in question is a copy.  Algorithms  The following are some algorithms and techniques proposed for video copy detection.  Global Descriptors   Global temporal descriptor  In this algorithm, a global intensity is defined as the sum of all intensities of all pixels weighted along all the video. Thus, an identity for a video sample can be constructed on the basis of the length of the video and the pixel intensities throughout. The global intensity a(t) is defined as: a(t)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N K(i)(I(i,t-1))^2 Where k is the weighting of the image, I is the image, and N is the number of pixels in the image.  Global ordinal measurement descriptor  In this algorithm, the video is divided in N blocks, sorted by gray level. Then it's possible to create a vector describing the average gray level of each block. With these average levels it is possible to create a new vector S(t), the video's signature: S(t)=(r_1, r_2, \\\\cdots ,r_N) To compare two videos, the algorithm defines a D(t) representing the similarity between both. D(t)=\\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\sum_{1=t- \\\\frac{T}{2} }^{t+ \\\\frac{T}{2} } \\\\begin{vmatrix}R(i)-C(i) \\\\end{vmatrix} The value returned by D(t) helps determine whether the video in question is a copy.  Ordinal and Temporal Descriptors  This technique was proposed by L.Chen and F. Stentiford. A measurement of dissimilarity is made by combining the two aforementioned algorithms, Global temporal descriptors and Global ordinal measurement descriptors, in time and space.  Local Descriptors   AJ  Described by A. Joly et al., this algorithm is an improvement of Harris' Interest Points detector. This technique suggests that in many videos a significant number of frames are almost identical, so it is more efficient to test not every frame but just those depicting a significant amount of motion.  ViCopT  ViCopT uses the interest points from each image to define a signature of the whole video. In every image, the algorithms identifies and defines two parts: the background, a set of static elements along a temporal sequence, and the motion, persistent points changing positions throughout the video.  Space Time Interest Points (STIP)  This algorithm was developed by I. Laptev and T.Lindeberg. It uses the interest points technique along the space and time to define the video signature, and creates a 34th- dimension vector that stores this signature.  Algorithm showcasing  There exist algorithms for video copy detection that are in use today. In 2007, there was an evaluation showcase known as the Multimedia Understanding Through Semantics, Computation and Learning (MUSCLE), which tested video copy detection algorithms on various video samples ranging from home video recordings to TV show segments ranging from one minute to one hour in length.

It lies in the centre of the state of Schleswig-Holstein in the region of Holstein (districts of Rendsburg-Eckernförde and Steinburg). It is sponsored by an association formed by the 2 districts.  Location  The nature park lies near Neumünster only a few kilometres west of the A 7 motorway. Two landscape forms occur in the park: the flat and pure loamy ground moraine landscape and the considerably more subdivided push moraine landscape, that rises to about 80 metres above NN.  Municipalities  The area of the nature park includes all or part of the following 42 towns and municipalities: *In Rendsburg-Eckernförde district: Hamweddel, Embühren (partially), Brinjahe, Stafstedt, Luhnstedt, Jevenstedt (partially), Brammer, Bargstedt, Oldenhütten, Nienborstel, Remmels, Nindorf, Heinkenborstel, Tappendorf, Rade b.

Landscape  The landscape is characterised by moraines, woods, heath and a large number of ponds. The most important rivers in the nature park are the Stör and its many tributaries in the centre and the smaller Bünzau with its tributaries, the Buckener Au, Fuhlenau and Höllenau. Its highest point is the Itzespitze (83.4 m).

These include the black stork, the eagle owl, many species of bat, the red kite, the common spadefoot toad and the alpine newt. Unique in Schleswig-Holstein are the wild-growing wolf's bane meadows. Since 2002 Heck cattle have been kept in order to control certain areas. In 2001 the Aukrug Nature Conservation Circle (Naturschutzring) was founded with assistance from the Schrobach Stiftung. This merger of various conservation organizations is intended to bring together the different interests of land users in the region and enable effective conservation work to be carried out. This approach has since become known as the Aukrug Way nationwide. In the first year of its existence the Nature Conservation Circle was able to set up or carry out several projects, including the re-watering of the Viertshöher Moor.  Places of interest  * the Reher Kratt nature reserve * the nature trail through the der Lehrpfad durch das Naturschutzgebiet Störkathener Heide nature reserve * the Peissener Loch, an unusual geological feature * the Erholungswald, a recreational wood, on the Boxberg hill * the soil educational path in the Bredenhoper Gehölz wood near Mörel * the Tönsheide Forest nature reserve * the circual walk through the Viertshöher Moor in Böken  Tourism  The region caters well for tourists and has a comprehensive network of bridleways, cycleways and trails.

The building is the only remaining structure that remains of a community by the name of Burgess, which was nicknamed Smithtown. The building is commonly referred to as the Smithtown Church. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History The cemetery in the churchyard. Historical marker The Sharon Methodist Church was incorporated in 1865 in the town of Burgess, which was a crossroads along the Camanche to Anamosa territorial road in northwest Clinton County. Land for a church and cemetery was donated by George Reed, a trustee and local landowner. Burials began in the cemetery soon after, while the church was not built until 1874. The financial depression of the early 1870s made money scarce. In 1875 St. John's Congregation of the German Reformed Church of Sharon Township paid one-fourth of what it cost to build the church to use the building for their services. They, therefore, had use of the church building one-fourth of the time. The Methodist congregation belonged to the Monmouth Circuit of the Upper Iowa Conference of the Methodist Church and was served by ministers from Monmouth, Iowa. The Reformed congregation was affiliated with St. Paul's Reformed Church in Wheatland and was served by ministers from that church. The two congregations shared the church building throughout their histories. In 1871 the Sabula, Ackley and Dakota Railroad announced plans to pass through Sharon Township. However, the tracks were to be built two miles south of Burgess. A station was built at Lost Nation and many of the village's business, including the general store, moved there to be near the railroad. The Good Templar Sharon Valley Lodge, a benevolent and charitable organization that promoted temperance, remained active at Smithtown until 1900. It was the two congregations shared commitment to temperance that may have made the Methodists willing to work with the Germans, who were not always accepted. Smithtown Church discontinued regular services in the late 1920s. Thereafter, it was used for special occasions such as funerals and community meetings. The Smithtown Cemetery Association was established in 1929 to care for the cemetery and the church. In 1931 they purchased the property from the Upper Iowa Conference. The cemetery association presented the property to the Clinton County Conservation Board for use as a historical site on August 2, 1970. Architecture The building is of wood construction in the Italianate style. It features a central bell tower on the main façade, where the entrance into the church is located. The tower is topped with a belfry and a short spire. The side walls of the church contain four rectangular windows with shutters.

Poststructural feminism emphasizes \\"the contingent and discursive nature of identities\\",Randall, Vicky (2010) 'Feminism' in Theory and Methods in Political Science. Marsh, David. Stoker, Gerry. (eds.), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 116. and in particular the social construction of gendered subjectivities.P. Prasad, Crafting Qualitative Research (2005) p. 165. A contribution of this branch was to argue that there is no universal single category of \\"woman\\" or \\"man.\\" Areas of interest Like post-structuralism itself, the feminist branch is in large part a tool for literary analysis, but it also deals in psychoanalysis and socio-cultural critique,J. Childers/G. Hentzi, The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (1995) p. 237 and seeks to explore relationships between language, sociology, subjectivity and power-relations as they impact upon gender in particular.Prasad, p. 165 Poststructural feminism also seeks to criticize the kyriarchy, while not being limited by narrow understandings of kyriarchal theory, particularly through an analysis of the pervasiveness of othering, the social exile of those people removed from the narrow concepts of normal. Leading figures *Luce Irigaray became famous for her poststructuralist work on The Sex Which is Not One (1977) and the deconstruction of the Oedipal Complex. *Hélène Cixous argued in her best-known essay 'The Laugh of the Medusa' that writing was more important in the construction of womanhood than biology.E. D. Ermath, Sequel to History (1992) p. 158 *Judith Butler explored the constricting nature of social norms in constructing 'normal' men and women;Judith Butler, Undoing Gender (2004) p. 206 and p. 8 and argued for a feminism without a feminist subject, fearing the constraining influence implicit in overt identity politics.G. Gutting ed., The Cambridge Companion to Foucault (2003) p. 390 Other significant figures in poststructuralist feminism include Monique Wittig, and Julia Kristeva.Ermath, p. 151-2 Literary examples *The heroine of Nice Work admits that, when younger, she \\"allowed myself to be constructed by the discourse of romantic love for a while\\"; but adds that she soon came to realise that \\"we aren't unique individual essences existing prior to language. There is only language\\".David Lodge, Nice Work (1988) p. 210 *The heroine of Possession, a novel by A.S. Byatt, more ruefully acknowledges that \\"we live in the truth of what Freud discovered...we question everything except the centrality of sexuality - Unfortunately feminism can hardly avoid privileging such matters\\".A. S. Byatt, Possession: A Romance (1990) p. 254 and p. 222 Criticism Poststructural feminism has been criticised for its abandonment of the humanistic female subject, and for tactical naivety in its rejection of any form of female essentialism.

The model originated in Härjedalen, hence the name, and the most recognized traditional bearer of the instrument was Olof Jönsson (1867–1953), called Ol'Jansa, in Överberg, Härjedalen.Ol'Jansas låtbok, Svenskt visarkiv 2006, The method of manufacture was preserved thanks to Oskar Olofsson in Lillhärdal, who passed his knowledge on to Gunnar Stenmark in Ås. Stenmark is today the most recognized maker of the instrument. The traditional Härjedalspipa is made from spruce and tuned in the key of A# at the bottom (all six finger holes covered). The scale includes some blue notes, in particular the third, sixth and seventh which are flat by 20-25 cents compared to the equal temperament scale. Today, instruments are made also in other keys and temperaments.

He was educated at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield and the University of Birmingham, from where he holds B.A. and M.Litt degrees. At the University of Birmingham he was taught by the leading historian of Chartism Dorothy Thompson, who has been a major influence on his work. This is reflected in the co-editing of a festschrift for Thompson entitled 'The Duty of Discontent' (1995), a collaboration with her on a collection of contemporary illustrations entitled 'Images of Chartism' (1998) and the editing of a posthumous collection of her writings entitled 'The Dignity of Chartism' (2015). Roberts has been described as an example of that increasingly rare phenomenon - the schoolteacher-scholar. For thirty years he held a teaching post at Hagley Catholic High School in Worcestershire whilst at the same time being a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham. He has described how a day might begin by teaching the Great Plague of 1665 to teenagers and might finish giving a paper on Chartism to a university seminar attended by venerable professors. For a brief period, Roberts also taught at Newman University, Birmingham. Roberts is the author of two monographs on Chartism: 'Radical Politicians and Poets in Early Victorian Britain' (1993) and 'The Chartist Prisoners' (2008). He has also written, with Owen Ashton, a study of working class authorship entitled 'The Victorian Working Class Author' (1999) and has edited, with Owen Ashton and Robert Fyson, a bibliography entitled 'The Chartist Movement' and a collection of essays entitled 'The Chartist Legacy' (1999). Roberts has also looked at these times from the other side of the political spectrum, editing, with Mark Acton, a collection of material relating to the colourful ultra-Tory MP for Lincoln, Colonel Sibtorp. Roberts' interest in a biographical approach to writing history is reflected also in his work on Victorian Birmingham. His series 'Birmingham Biographies' (www.birmingham-biographies) seeks to recover the stories of Birmingham politicians and businessmen who have been overshadowed by Joseph Chamberlain. This series consists of short biographies of, amongst others, the photographer Sir Benjamin Stone (2014), the entrepreneur Sir Richard Tangye (2015) and the pen maker and art collector Joseph Gillott (2017). These men are gently sent up in Mocking Men of Power, a collection of contemporary cartoons co-edited with Roger Ward. This book draws on Birmingham's famous satirical magazines the Dart and the Owl. 'Birmingham 1889: One Year in a Victorian City' (2017), an entertaining look at what local people did and thought in the year Birmingham became a city, also makes extensive use of these magazines. Roberts has spoken about the Chartists on BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and Radio WM. Since 2015 he has been Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University.

It is often claimed that he created vichyssoise soup, though this is unproven and disputed. Biography Childhood Diat was born in 1885 in Bourbon-l'Archambault/Montmarault, France, where his father managed a shoe store. During the summer, when Diat and his siblings desired a cold snack, Diat's mother Annette often poured milk into leftover potato-and-leek soup (potage bonne femme). At age five, Diat learned to cook. At age eight, he awoke early before school to cook soup. He observed the cooking of his mother and grandmother. His mother taught him tarts, while his grandmother demonstrated how to broil chicken over charcoal. By age 13, Diat resolved to become a chef, and by 14, he entered into an apprenticeship in a Moulins patisserie. Culinary profession At 18, he spent tours of duty at Paris' Hôtel Le Bristol Paris and L'Hotel Du Rhin. Diat was appointed chef potager (soup chef) in 1903 at Hôtel Ritz Paris. In 1906, at 21, he transferred to The Ritz Hotel London, where he held the same position and also aided the main sauce maker. At both locations, Diat was coached by founder César Ritz. On October 8, 1910, aged 25, Diat immigrated to New York, becoming the chef of Carlton House on 23 October 1910 and about 7 weeks later the head chef of the newly opened Ritz-Carlton in Manhattan. The first week of November, Diat applied to be a citizen of the United States. Diat served as the chef de cuisine at the Ritz-Carlton's roof-garden restaurant. Auguste Escoffier oversaw the inauguration of the restaurant. Diat invented a novel recipe every summer for the sultry climate. During his 41-year stint at the Ritz-Carlton, he cooked for King Edward VIII as the Prince of Wales; other nobles like queens, prime ministers, and ambassadors; and on one occasion, the exclusive wine club Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin (\\"Knights of the Wine Cup\\"). He \\"worked fourteen hours a day, six days a week, and spent seven or eight hours at the hotel on Sunday, his day off\\". According to Lawrence, Diat was the supervisor of 150 chefs. \\"Formidable\\" yet benign, Diat served as the kitchen mediator and first aid expert in the case of injuries. Diat forbade the use of substitutes in food, and rejected the proposition of a canned version of vichyssoise. Diat typically reached his office by 8:15 am and spent slightly over an hour ordering goods. For the remainder of the morning, he supervised and advised his kitchen staff and confirmed the menus. In the afternoon, he wrote in his office. Diat taught cooking classes in the kitchens. Some of his students became chefs at other hotels in New York, Washington, D.C., and Colorado. Diat received a visit from the president of the Campbell Soup Company, Arthur Dorance, who stayed at the Ritz for half a year to learn Diat's soup making techniques. In 1938, Diat won the distinguished Chevalier du Mérite Agricole \\"for having done so much to bring an important element of culture and civilization to the United States\\". In 1947, Diat became the in- house chef of Gourmet. Diat was included in a list of chefs with annual salaries of $10,000 to $25,000. Later years On 2 May 1951, the Ritz- Carlton closed for demolition. Diat prepared a \\"farewell luncheon\\" for the kitchen personnel. Diat retired, returning to his home in Hartsdale, where he spent the rest of his life writing cookbooks. On 29 August 1957, Diat died in New York Hospital aged 72. Invention of vichyssoise In 1917, seeking to \\"invent some new and startling cold soup\\" for the menu at the Ritz-Carlton, he recalled his mother's soup. His experimenting soon led to a combination of \\"leeks, onions, potatoes, butter, milk, cream and other seasonings\\". Diat named it \\"crème vichyssoise glacée\\" (chilled cream vichyssoise), after Vichy, a spa town near his birthplace in France that is famous for both its exceptional food and its springs. The new item enjoyed \\"instant success\\". Charles M. Schwab was the first to sample vichyssoise and requested another serving. Vichyssoise was served the rest of the summer and the following summers. During the colder seasons, he did not include it in the menu, but so many people asked for it, in 1923, Diat placed it on the menu full-time. Diat recalled that Sara Roosevelt had had vichysoisse and \\"once called me up at five in the afternoon and asked me to send eight portions to her house\\". When Diat had no access to leeks in his cooking, his vexation prompted the produce stocker to find a Long Island farmer to cultivate a small yield. Personal life Diat and his wife Suzanne had one child, a daughter, Suzette. Between 1916 and 1929, the family lived in New Rochelle, N.Y. Between 1929 and January 1950, they lived in a small apartment on Manhattan's Central Park West. Thereafter, Diat and his wife lived in Hartsdale, in Westchester County, N.Y. Suzette Diat married George J. Lawrence, with whom she had two children. In an interview, Suzette Diat Lawrence described her father as \\"a gentle, humble man, simple in his tastes. ... He enjoyed good cooking. It didn't have to be fancy as long as it was prepared well without too much seasoning and not too rich\\". She considered her father a patient instructor, \\"He would answer any question concerned with cooking. He had no secrets.\\" Additionally, Diat \\"taught his family the art of using leftovers\\" to create new dishes. Diat's two brothers also distinguished themselves in the culinary field. Jules Diat was a teacher. His son (Louis's nephew) was chef saucier (sauce chef) at the 1939 New York World's Fair. A participant in the French Resistance during World War II, he was killed by the Germans. Lucien Diat, younger than Louis by seventeen years, was the renowned executive chef at Plaza Athénée hotel in Paris and also the teacher of Jacques Pépin.Jacques Pépin, The Apprentice: My Life in the Kitchen (New York: Houghton Mifflin 2004), p. 88. Writer Aside from writing magazine features for Gourmet, Diat also authored some cookbooks. He collaborated with Helen E. Ridley, a home economist and administrator of the J. Walter Thompson Company. She reminisced, \\"Louis always thought the United States had a magnificent supply of really fine foods, that there was no place in Europe that could rival it in the variety and quality of available ingredients.\\" Cooking à la Ritz included Diat's recipe for vichyssoise, along with other dishes he created during his time at the Ritz-Carlton. In Louis Diat's French Cookbook for Americans, Diat compared cooking in the United States with cooking in France. He noted that the key to cooking is appeal. \\"[Americans] could do it as well as the French, but one has to be interested. In France girls of 11 already are able to prepare meals from watching and helping their mothers. It's early training that does it\\". Diat proceeded to discuss meat, gravies, fish, and salads. Finally, he added that \\"fine cooking is the basis of a happy life ... Men like to eat well ... so if you want to keep your husband home, learn to be a good cook.\\" Many of the recipes in this book are derived from the meals Diat's mother cooked. Diat alleged that American women cannot cook since they \\"often ruin good food trying to save\\" money or time. In response to this dilemma, Diat wrote a book entitled La Cuisine de Ma Mère to divulge all his \\"cooking secrets\\". Diat suggests that they \\"approach their cooking with imagination, interest and an eye for artistic effects\\". Ascribing his culinary finesse to his mother, Diat dedicated the book to his mother, \\"Annette Alajoinine Diat, who guided the early years, inspired the later ones and whose memory is still a spur\\". In Sauces: French and Famous (1951), Diat discussed how to make the sauces bechamel, brown sauce, tomato sauce, and mayonnaise. He also included a narration of his eating habits. Diat also wrote French Cooking for the Home (1956) and Gourmet's Basic French Cookbook (1961).

The British were known for utilising Firqa during their counter insurgency operations in support of the Sultan's operations in the region, converting former enemies into pro-government militia to aid in counter- insurgency; this was a tactic the British had successfully employed in Malaya. Forming local Firqa was therefore great way to employ surrendered enemy personnel (SEPs) and thus pacify areas of the Dhofari Jebel and set the conditions for infrastructure development. During the insurgency in Dhofar Firqa forces proved invaluable as both a tactical and psychological weapon; although their use beyond Jebali tribal areas was problematic. Firqa continued at least until recent times; as recently as 1990 the Omani government was issuing payments of 120-140 rials per month.

It existed from 1887 to 1890. The Council was the brain- child of Lord Harris. In November 1886 he had sent a letter to the County Secretaries asking the question as to whether the existing two year qualification rule should be reduced to one year. Under this rule players who changed counties generally had to serve a two year residence qualification in their new county during which they were unable to play inter-county matches for either county. The proposal was defeated at the annual Secretary's meeting in December 1886, but at the same meeting it was agreed that a committee be set up to consider the rules of county cricket generally. At a meeting in July 1887, at which the report of the committee was considered, it was agreed that a County Cricket Council be formed. It was further agreed that the existing committee frame the by-laws of the new Council. The first meeting on the Council was on 5 December 1887 at which Lord Harris was elected Chairman. Nothing specific was agreed at this meeting but at a further meeting on 8 February 1888 a change to the hours of play was agreed, as was a proposal regarding a change in the lbw law. Since the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) decided the laws this was no more than a suggestion. A proposal abolishing boundaries in favour of all hits run out was defeated. At the December 1888 meeting a number of proposals relating to the qualification rules were considered but were not carried. At the December 1889 meeting a proposal by Durham regarding the classification of the counties and a system of promotion and relegation was considered. A committee was set up to consider the issues. The committee proposed three tiers of counties; the existing 8 first class counties, 8 second-class counties and a further 8 third-class counties. It proposed a system of promotion and relegation involving the bottom team of one division playing the top team in the lower division. They would play each other home and away in the following season, the results determining whether the two changed places. Any change would take place in the following season, promotion would therefore take two years. These proposals were considered at the fourth annual meeting of the Council in December 1890. They were not well received. Eventually a vote was taken on whether The Cricket Council itself should be suspended sine die. The motion was passed on the casting vote of the Chairman, Mr M.J. Ellison, and The Cricket Council effectively ceased to exist. \\"This utterly unexpected result fairly took those present by surprise, and they dispersed hurriedly - a most undignified ending to what we are compelled to describe as a most unbusinesslike meeting.\\" On the following day, 9 December 1890, the county secretaries met to decide the fixtures for 1891. Since the Council had collapsed and no proposal had been passed the counties arranged their fixtures on the old basis of arranging \\"home and home\\" matches against whichever counties they wished. \\"The most noticeable feature ... is the encouragement given to Somersetshire by the chief county clubs. Middlesex played the western shire last summer, but Kent, Surrey, Yorkshire, Gloucestershire and Lancashire will next summer test the merits of the eleven, which showed such good all round cricket, under Mr. H.T. Hewett's command, last year.\\" By arranging these 12 matches against first-class counties Somerset became a de facto first-class county without any proposal or vote to that effect.

It is considered the symbol of the city. Until the last third of the 19th century, the city of Krems was surrounded by a wall. This was systematically razed, and three gates were also removed. From 2005, celebrating the 700-year anniversary of the city rights, the Steiner Tor was restored as much to its original as possible. Outside the portal are towers flanking both sides, which, like the lower floor of the gate, date from the late Middle Ages. On the right of the archway is a small stone coat of arms mentioning Emperor Friedrich III, and the year 1480 in Roman numerals. This is believed to date the restoration of the fortifications that had become necessary because of the destruction wrought by Hungarian troops in 1477. The tower building dates from much more recently, and dates to the Baroque period during the reign of Maria Theresa, 1756. Outside the gate, the Steiner Tor was originally threatened by flooding from the Danube. On the inner side of the stone door is a mounted memorial which commemorates such a disaster in 1573. In the immediate vicinity of the Steiner Tor is a shopping centre. On 1 February 1960, Österreichische Post issued a definitive stamp with a value of 3.40 Schillings on a postage stamp.

This is a rail shooter with light adventure elements. Summary Sometime in the near future (assumed to be Detroit in the year 1998 according to the game's story), a strange cult known as The Sect rises to power. Its members are called \\"sectoids\\" and believe in an entity of steel called the Deck. The sectoids are presented as a quasi-terrorist organisation, determined to destroy the present status quo of society moving against schools, hospitals and civilians. Their number is constantly rising and by the start of the game, the government, the police and the military are inadequate to stop them. The player character is the helicopter pilot named Ted Irvin (David Gregg) who at the start of the game flies to rescue victims who were engaged by sectoids in a warehouse. Once there, he sees he arrived too late and his helicopter is destroyed by an explosion. After a skirmish he falls unconscious and is abducted by the Rebels. Irvin is brought to their base and talks to the Rebel leader, Morgan (Joseph Rezwin). Seen that he is not of the Sect, they ask him to join them and is offered a shelter to sleep. When he wakes up, he sees the base being overrun by sectoids. Fighting his way out, he meets a Rebel girl, Catherine (Rochelle Redfield) but they are both caught by Sect forces outside. In the process, he sees that Morgan has joined the sect and they are preparing to sacrifice Irvin to the Deck. However he discovers he has telekinetic powers which help him escape the Sect base. He finds that Catherine has also escaped and together they steal a truck and she drives to the Rebel hideout, where they are reunited with Lars (David Gasman), a man he had already met in the Rebel base. Once more, the building is overrun by sectoids. He escapes and sees the building destroyed. While he falls down exhausted in the rain, he sees Yssel (Patrick Julien), a Sect leader, asking him to join them. When he recovers, he returns to the base and finds a strange kid with white eye pupils telling him to seek his past for answers. Soon afterwards he is joined by Lars and Catherine who escaped the disaster. Together they go to Chicago where Irvin hopes to find answers concerning his powers and the meaning of some strange visions he has, seen in the course of the game as cutscenes. Reception Game Revolution gave the game a 4.5 out of 5, and praised it for good video sequences and excellent action.

Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing. pp. 128–130. was a covert intelligence-gathering and counter-insurgency unit of the British Army active in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. A former member described it as a \\"legalised death squad\\". The unit was formed during the summer of 1971 and operated until late 1972 or early 1973. MRF teams operated in plain clothes and civilian vehicles, equipped with pistols and submachine guns. They were tasked with tracking down and arresting, or killing, members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). The MRF also ran agents within the paramilitary groups, as well as a number of front companies to gather intelligence. In October 1972, the IRA uncovered and attacked two of the MRF's front companies— a mobile laundry service and a massage parlour— which contributed to the unit's dissolution. The MRF was succeeded by the Special Reconnaissance Unit (SRU; or 14 Intelligence Company) and, later, by the Force Research Unit (FRU). Origins and structure The MRF was established in the summer of 1971. It appears to have its origins in ideas and techniques developed by Brigadier Frank Kitson (later General Sir Frank Kitson), a senior commander in the British Army, who had created \\"counter gangs\\" to defeat the Mau Mau in the Colony and Protectorate of Kenya. He was the author of two books on counter-insurgency tactics: Gangs & Counter Gangs (1960) and Low Intensity Operations (1971). From 1970 to 1972, Kitson served in Northern Ireland as commander of the 39th Infantry Brigade. It has been claimed that he was responsible for establishing the MRF and that the unit was attached to his Brigade. The MRF was based at Palace Barracks in the Belfast suburb of Holywood. The MRF's first commander was Captain Arthur Watchus.Ware, John. \\"Britain's Secret Terror Force\\". Irish Republican News, 23 November 2013. Retrieved 23 November 2013. In June 1972, he was succeeded as commander by Captain James 'Hamish' McGregor. It was split into squads, each of which was led by a Senior NCO who had served in the Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), the Royal Marines or the Parachute Regiment. The unit consisted of up to 40 men, handpicked from throughout the British Army.\\"Undercover soldiers 'killed unarmed civilians in Belfast'\\". BBC News. 21 November 2013. Retrieved 22 November 2013. Modus operandi In March 1994, the UK's Junior Defence Minister Jeremy Hanley issued the following description of the MRF in reply to a parliamentary written question: \\"The MRF was a small military unit which, during the period 1971 to 1973, was responsible for carrying out surveillance tasks in Northern Ireland in those circumstances where soldiers in uniform and with Army vehicles would be too easily recognized\\".Moloney, Ed. Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland. 2010. pp.118-119 Martin Dillon described the MRF's purpose as being \\"to draw the Provisional IRA into a shooting war with loyalists in order to distract the IRA from its objective of attacking the Army\\".Dillon, Martin, The Enemy Within: The IRA’s war against the British (1994), Doubleday, p.120. Many details about the unit's modus operandi have been revealed by former members. One issued a statement to the Troops Out Movement in July 1978. In 2012–13, a former MRF member using the covername 'Simon Cursey' gave a number of interviews and published the book MRF Shadow Troop about his time in the unit. In November 2013, a BBC Panorama documentary was aired about the MRF. It drew on information from seven former members, as well as a number of other sources. The MRF had both a \\"defensive\\" surveillance role and an \\"offensive\\" role. MRF operatives patrolled the streets in these cars in teams of two to four, tracking down and arresting or killing suspected IRA members. They were armed with Browning pistols and Sterling sub-machine guns. Former MRF members admitted that the unit shot unarmed people without warning, both IRA members and civilians. Former MRF members claim they had a list of targets they were ordered to \\"shoot on sight\\". One member interviewed for the BBC's Panorama, Soldier F, said \\"We were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group\\". Soldier H said \\"We operated initially with them thinking that we were the UVF\\", to which Soldier F added: \\"We wanted to cause confusion\\". Another said that their role was \\"to draw out the IRA and to minimise their activities\\". They said they fired on groups of people manning defensive barricades, on the assumption that some might be armed. The MRF member who made a statement in 1978 opined that the unit's role was one of \\"repression through fear, terror and violence\\".Murray, Raymond. The SAS in Ireland. Mercier Press, 1990. pp.44-45 He said that the unit had been trained to use weapons favoured by the IRA. Republicans argued that the MRF deliberately attacked civilians for two main reasons: firstly, to draw the IRA into a sectarian conflict with loyalists and divert it from its campaign against the state; and secondly, to show Catholics that the IRA could not protect them, thus draining its support.Dillon, The Dirty War, pp.55-56 The MRF's surveillance operations included the use of front companies (see below) and disguises. Former members claim they posed as road sweepers, dustmen and even homeless meths-drinkers while carrying out surveillance. The MRF is known to have used agents referred to as 'Freds'. These were republican or loyalist paramilitaries who were recruited by British Military Intelligence. The Freds would work inside paramilitary groups, feeding back information to the MRF. They were also ferried through Belfast in armoured cars, and through the gunslit would point-out paramilitary individuals of note. Through this method the MRF compiled extensive photographs and dossiers of Belfast militants of both factions.Dillon, Martin. The Dirty War. Random House, 1991. Attacks on civilians In 1972, MRF teams carried out a number of drive-by shootings in Catholic and Irish nationalist areas of Belfast, some of which were attributed to Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. At least fifteen civilians were shot. MRF members have affirmed the unit's involvement in most of these attacks. There are also allegations that the unit helped loyalists to carry out attacks. McGurk's Bar bombing On 4 December 1971, the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) detonated a time bomb at the door of McGurk's public house, located on the corner of North Queen Street and Great George's Street in Belfast. The pub was frequented by Irish Catholics/nationalists. The explosion caused the building to collapse, killing fifteen Catholic civilians and wounding seventeen more. It was the deadliest attack in Belfast during the Troubles. The book Killing For Britain (2009), written by former UVF member 'John Black', claims that the MRF organised the bombing and helped the bombers get in and out of the area.Police Ombudsman's report, p.16 Two days before the bombing, republican prisoners had escaped from nearby Crumlin Road Prison. Security was tightened, and there were many checkpoints in the area at the time. However, locals claimed that the security forces helped the bombers by removing the checkpoints an hour before the attack.The bombing of McGurk's Bar, Belfast, on 4 December 1971 . Report by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. February 2011. p.9 One of the bombers—Robert Campbell—said that their original target had been The Gem, a nearby pub that was allegedly linked to the Official IRA. It is claimed the MRF plan was to help the UVF bomb The Gem, and then blame the bombing on the Provisional IRA. This would start a feud between the two IRA factions, diverting them from their fight against the security forces and draining their support. Campbell said that The Gem had security outside and, after waiting for almost an hour, they decided to bomb the nearest 'Catholic pub' instead. Immediately afterward, the security forces claimed that a bomb had accidentally exploded while being handled by IRA members inside McGurk's.\\"Collusion and Cover-Up\\". The McGurk's Bar Massacre. Whiterock Road shooting On 15 April 1972, brothers Gerry and John Conway—both Catholic civilians—were walking along Whiterock Road to catch a bus.Dillon, The Dirty War, pp.52–55 As they passed St Thomas's School, a car stopped, and three men leapt out and began shooting at them with pistols. The brothers ran, but both were shot and wounded. Witnesses said one of the gunmen returned to the car and spoke into a handset radio. Shortly afterward two armoured personnel carriers arrived, and there was a conversation between the uniformed and the plainclothes soldiers. The three vehicles then left, and the brothers were taken by ambulance to the Royal Victoria Hospital. The British Army told journalists that a patrol had encountered two wanted men, that one had fired at the patrol, and that the patrol returned fire. In a 1978 interview, a former MRF member claimed he had been one of the gunmen. He confirmed that the brothers were unarmed but claimed his patrol had mistaken the brothers for two IRA men whom the MRF were ordered to \\"shoot on sight\\". Andersonstown shootings On 12 May 1972, the British government announced there would be no disciplinary action against the soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday. That night, MRF teams shot seven Catholic civilians in the Andersonstown area. An MRF team in an unmarked car approached a checkpoint manned by members of the Catholic Ex-Servicemen's Association (CESA) at the entrance to Riverdale Park South. The CESA was an unarmed vigilante organization set up to protect Catholic areas.Organizations: C. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) The car stopped, and then reversed. One of the MRF men opened fire from the car with a sub-machine gun, killing Catholic civilian Patrick McVeigh (44) and wounding four others. The car continued on, turned, and then drove past the scene of the shooting. All of the men were local residentsMcKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. p.182 and McVeigh, who was shot through the back, had stopped to chat to the CESA members as he walked home. He was a married father of six children. The British Army told journalists that gunmen in a passing car had fired indiscriminately at civilians and called it an \\"apparently motiveless crime\\". The car had come from a Protestant area and had returned the same way. This, together with the British Army statement, implied that loyalists were responsible. An inquest into the attack was held in December 1972, where it was admitted that the car's occupants were soldiers belonging to an undercover unit known as the MRF. The soldiers did not appear at the inquest but issued statements to it, claiming they had been shot at by six gunmen and were returning fire. However, eyewitnesses said none of the CESA members were armed, and this was supported by forensic evidence. The MRF members involved were never prosecuted. There is no evidence that any of their targets were in the IRA.\\"Undercover Northern Ireland soldiers accused of killing unarmed civilians\\". The Guardian, 21 November 2013. Retrieved 4 January 2014. An MRF member stated in 1978 that the British Army's intention was to make it look like a loyalist attack, thus provoking sectarian conflict and \\"taking the heat off the Army\\". Minutes before the shooting at the checkpoint, two other Catholic civilians had been shot nearby by another MRF team. The two young men—Aidan McAloon and Eugene Devlin—had gotten a taxi home from a disco and were dropped off at Slievegallion Drive. As they began walking along the street, in the direction of a vigilante barricade, the MRF team opened fire on them from an unmarked car. The MRF team told the Royal Military Police that they had shot a man who was firing a rifle. Witnesses said there was no gunman on the street, and police forensics experts found no evidence that McAloon or Devlin had fired weapons. Two weeks later, on 27 May, Catholic civilian Gerard Duddy (20) was killed in a drive-by shooting at the same spot where Patrick McVeigh was killed. His death was blamed on loyalists.McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.192 Killing of Jean Smith On the night of 9 June 1972, Catholic civilian Jean Smith (or Smyth) was shot dead on the Glen Road. Jean was a 24-year-old mother of one.McKittrick, Lost Lives, p.198 She was shot while sitting in the passenger seat of a car at the Glen Road bus terminus. As her male companion turned the car, he heard what he thought was a tyre bursting. When he got out to check, the car was hit by a burst of automatic gunfire. Smith was shot in the head and died shortly afterward. Her companion stopped a passing taxi and asked the driver to take her to hospital. However, the taxi was then stopped by police and diverted to Andersonstown RUC base, where they were held for several hours.\\"Undercover army unit linked to killing previously blamed on IRA\\". The Irish News, 9 June 2015. The security forces blamed the killing on the IRA. In October 1973, however, the Belfast Telegraph published an article suggesting that Smith could have been shot by the MRF. Documents uncovered from the British National Archives reveal that the MRF fired shots in the area that night. They claim to have fired at two gunmen and hit one of them.\\"In Memoriam: Jean Smyth-Campbell\\". Paper Trail - Legacy Archive Research. 8 June 2015. The Belfast Telegraph article also suggested that Smith could have been shot by the IRA, who fired on the car thinking it was carrying MRF members. The IRA deny this and claim that it was not in the area at the time of the shooting. Two weeks after Smith's killing, the MRF fired on a car at the same spot, wounding four people. Glen Road shooting On 22 June 1972, the Provisional IRA announced that it would begin a ceasefire in four days, as a prelude to secret talks with the British Government.Chronology of the Conflict: June 1972. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) That afternoon, MRF members in an unmarked car shot and wounded three Catholic men standing by a car at Glen Road bus terminus. A man in a nearby house was also wounded by the gunfire.Fields, Rona M. Northern Ireland: Society Under Siege. Transaction Publishers, 1977. pp.138-139 Shortly afterward, the MRF unit's car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the occupants were arrested. Inside the car was a Thompson sub-machine gun, \\"for years the IRA's favourite weapon\\". One of the MRF members—Clive Graham Williams—was charged with attempted murder. He told the court that two of the men had been armed, and one had fired at the MRF car. He claimed he was returning fire. Witnesses said that none of the civilians were armed, and that it was an unprovoked attack. Police forensics experts found no evidence that the civilians had fired weapons. However, key witnesses were not called to give evidence in person, and Williams was acquitted on 26 June 1973. He was later promoted and awarded the Military Medal for bravery. St James's Crescent shooting On the night of 27 September 1972, the MRF shot dead Catholic civilian Daniel Rooney and wounded his friend Brendan Brennan.\\"Britain’s secret force ‘used IRA tactics’ during the Troubles\\". TheJournal.ie. 14 November 2013. Retrieved 19 November 2013. They were shot from a passing car while standing on a street corner at St James's Crescent, in the Falls district.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Random House, 2001. p.269 The British Army told journalists that the two men fired at an undercover patrol and that the patrol returned fire. It further claimed that the two men were IRA members. The IRA, the men's families, and residents of the area denied this, and Rooney's name has never appeared on a republican roll of honour. An inquest was held in December 1973. The court was told that forensic tests on the men's hands and clothing found no firearms residue. The six soldiers involved repeated the British Army's claim, but they did not appear at the inquest. Their statements were read by a police officer and they were referred to by initials. New Lodge Six There are also allegations that the MRF was involved in a drive- by shooting in the Catholic New Lodge area on 3 February 1973. The car's occupants opened fire on a group of young people standing outside a pub on Antrim Road, killing IRA members James Sloan and James McCann and wounding others. The gunmen drove on and allegedly fired at another group of people outside a takeaway. In the hours that followed, a further four people—an IRA member and three civilians—were shot dead in the area by British snipers. The dead became known as the \\"New Lodge Six\\".The New Lodge Six . Troops Out Movement. Retrieved 19 November 2013.\\"New Lodge Six inquiry\\". An Phoblacht. 21 November 2002. Retrieved 19 November 2013.Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1973. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). In June 1973, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association issued advice on how to behave in the event of being \\"shot by MRF/SAS squads\\", saying for example that people should \\"pretend to be dead until the squad moves away\\".Dillon, The Dirty War, p.255 Front companies The MRF ran a number of front companies in Belfast during the early 1970s. They included Four Square Laundry (a mobile laundry service operating in nationalist West Belfast) and the Gemini massage parlour on Antrim Road.Dillon, The Dirty War, p.41 The MRF also had an office at College Square. All were set up to gather intelligence on the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Irish nationalist movement. A Four Square van visited houses in nationalist West Belfast twice a week to collect and deliver laundry.Dillon, The Dirty War, p.29 One \\"employee\\" (a young man) drove the van while another (a young woman) collected and delivered the laundry. Both were from Northern Ireland. Four Square initially gathered customers by offering \\"discount vouchers\\", which were numbered and colour-coded by street. Clothes collected for washing were first forensically checked for traces of explosives, as well as blood or firearms residue. They were also compared to previous laundry loads from the same house—the sudden presence of different- sized clothes could indicate that the house was harbouring an IRA member. Surveillance operatives and equipment were hidden in the back of the van or in a compartment in the roof. Further intelligence was gathered by staff observing and \\"chatting\\" to locals whilst collecting their laundry. However, in September 1972, the IRA found that two of its members—Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee—were working for the MRF as double agents. Under interrogation, McKee told the IRA about the MRF's operations, including the laundry and the massage parlour.Dillon, Martin. The Trigger Men, Mainstream Publishing, 2003, p. 66 The leaders of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade ordered that the companies immediately be put under surveillance. This surveillance confirmed that McKee's information was correct.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 67 The IRA later took Wright and McKee to South Armagh, where they were \\"executed\\" as spies.Guardian Their bodies were recovered in 2015.Who were the Disappeared? October 1972 attacks Following these revelations, the leaders of the IRA's Belfast Brigade planned an operation against the MRF, which was to take place on 2 October 1972. The 2nd Battalion would attack the Four Square Laundry van and the office at College Square, while the 3rd Battalion would raid the massage parlour.Taylor, pp.135-136 At about 11:20AM on 2 October, IRA volunteers ambushed the Four Square Laundry van in the nationalist Twinbrook area of West Belfast. Four volunteers were involved: one drove the car while three others did the shooting. They shot dead the driver, an undercover British soldier of the Royal Engineers, and machine-gunned the roof compartment where undercover operatives were thought to be hiding. The other Four Square employee—a female operative from the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC)—was collecting and delivering laundry from a nearby house at the time. The residents, who thought that loyalists were attacking the van, took her into the house and kept her safe. The woman was later secretly invested at Buckingham Palace with an MBE. About an hour later, the same IRA unit raided College Square but found nobody there. Meanwhile, a unit of the 3rd Battalion made for the room above the massage parlour, which they believed was being used to gather intelligence. They claimed to have shot three undercover soldiers: two men and a woman. According to some sources, the IRA claimed to have killed two surveillance officers allegedly hidden in the laundry van, and two MRF members at the massage parlour. However, the British military only confirmed the death of the van driver on that day. Brendan Hughes said that the operation \\"was a great morale booster for the IRA and for the people that were involved\\". The MRF, realising its undercover operations were blown, disbanded the units and was itself disbanded shortly afterwards. The incident was believed to have prompted the establishment of a new undercover intelligence unit: the 14 Intelligence Company (also known as \\"The Det\\").

Social security systems provided for by states consist of social insurance programs, which provide earned benefits for workers and their families by employment contributions, and/or social assistance programs which provide non- contributory benefits designed to provide minimum levels of social security to persons unable to access social insurance.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises the right to social security in articles 22, which states that: > \\"Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is > entitled to realization, through national effort and international co- > operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each > State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his > dignity and the free development of his personality.\\" And article 25, which enshrines the right to an adequate standard of living, stating that: > \\"(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health > and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, > housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to > security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old > age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. (2) > Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All > children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social > protection.\\"  International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights  Article 9 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognises \\"the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance.\\" The right to social security is furthermore recognised in Article 10, which states that \\"special protection should be accorded to mothers during a reasonable period before and after childbirth. During such period working mothers should be accorded paid leave or leave with adequate social security benefits.\\" State parties to the ICESCR have the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to social security. In the General Comment no 19 (2007) On the Right to Social Security the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights clarified that the right to social security as enshrined in the ICESCR encompasses: > \\"the right to access and maintain benefits, whether in cash or in kind, from > (a) lack of work-related income caused by sickness, disability, maternity, > employment injury, unemployment, old age, or death of a family member; (b) > unaffordable access to health care; (c) insufficient family support, > particularly children and adult dependents\\" Social security is understood to encompass the following nine branches: adequate health service, disability benefits, old age benefits, unemployment benefits, employment injury insurance, family and child support, maternity benefits, disability protections, and provisions for survivors and orphans. State parties to the ICESCR have the obligation to fulfil the right to social security by adopting \\"the necessary measures, including the implementation of a social security scheme\\". State parties must ensure that \\"the social security system will be adequate, accessible for everyone and will cover social risks and contingencies\\". State parties also have an obligation to facilitate the right to social security by sufficiently \\"recognizing this right within the national political and legal systems, preferably by way of legislative implementation\\" and \\"adopting a national social security strategy\\".  Other international human rights instruments  The right to social security is also recognised in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination which in article five requires that State parties must prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination in all of its forms, and to guarantee the right of everyone \\"without distinction as to race, colour, or national or ethnic origin, to equality before the law, notably in the enjoyment of... the right to public health, medical care, social security and social services\\". The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women enshrines the right to social security for women in article 11, stating that women have \\"the right to social security, particularly in cases of retirement, unemployment, sickness, invalidity and old age and other incapacity to work, as well as the right to paid leave.\\" The Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines the right of children to social security in article 26, stating that: > \\"(1) States Parties shall recognize for every child the right to benefit > from social security, including social insurance, and shall take the > necessary measures to achieve the full realization of this right in > accordance with their national law. (2) The benefits should, where > appropriate, be granted, taking into account the resources and the > circumstances of the child and persons having responsibility for the > maintenance of the child, as well as any other consideration relevant to an > application for benefits made by or on behalf of the child.\\" The Convention further elaborates on the right of children to social security in article 18 in relation to working parents, stating that \\"States Parties shall render appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities and shall ensure the development of institutions, facilities and services for the care of children.\\" According to the Convention \\"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that children of working parents have the right to benefit from child-care services and facilities for which they are eligible.\\" Article 20 of the Convention makes provisions for the right to social security of children without parents, stating that \\"A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State.\\" And that \\"States Parties shall in accordance with their national laws ensure alternative care for such a child.\\"  Relationship with other rights  The right to social security is interrelated and interdependent with other economic, social and cultural rights, in particular the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to food and the right to housing, the right to work, and the right to protection of the family. According to the UN Human Rights Committee article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on discrimination applies to the right to social security. In a General Comment from 2000 the Committee highlighted the right to social security as an area where women are frequently subject of discrimination.  Implementation  Globally the access to social security is low and 80 percent of the global population have no access to any formal social security protection.

Life Huddleston was born in 1583 at Farington Hall, near Preston, Lancashire. He was the youngest son of Andrew Hudleston, esq., of Farington Hall, by Mary, third daughter of Cuthbert Hutton of Hutton John, Cumberland. He studied under Thomas Sommers, a Catholic schoolmaster at Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire, and was subsequently sent to the English College at Douay. Afterwards he studied philosophy and divinity for some years in the English College at Rome. Returning to Douay he was ordained priest in 1607, and in the following year was sent on the English mission. Again visiting Italy he was professed as a Benedictine monk at Monte Cassino. In 1619 he came back to the mission, and was instrumental in conversions among major families in Lancashire and Yorkshire to the Roman Catholic faith. Huddleston died at Stockeld Park, the seat of the Middletons, on 26 November 1655. Works Huddleston left several pieces in manuscript, which appear to have been lost, and a Short and Plain Way to the Faith and Church, published by his nephew, Father John Hudleston, London, 1688; reprinted in the \\"English Catholic Library\\" vol. ii., London, 1844, under the editorial care of the Rev.

He is perhaps best known for his 1980 novel Honkytonk Man, made into a film by Clint Eastwood. Early years Carlile was born in the Choctaw Nation's tribal jurisdictional area in Oklahoma, and his father was Cherokee. He had an erratic childhood, and moved to Texas at a young age. Carlile was a high school drop-out. He worked as a cotton picker until his family moved to California to pick fruit. He served in the army during the Korean War and after being discharged, obtained a master's degree at San Francisco State University. Career Carlile began writing, and penned his first novel, presumably As I Was Young and Easy (1958) in just 17 days. This was followed by Spore 7 (1979). In Honkytonk Man (1980), the tale of the life and death of a country singer which was made into a film by Clint Eastwood in which Eastwood also starred, Carlile wrote both the novel and the screenplay. His final novel, Children of the Dust (1995), about the settling of Oklahoma, was made into a CBS mini-series featuring Sidney Poitier. This novel is related to the author's heritage, being from the Oklahoma Territory. The story is set in the late 1880s, with Gypsy Smith (Poitier) being a gunslinger of African American and Cherokee descent who helps African American homesteaders settle the territory under the specter of white people. The novel, The Paris Pilgrims, regarding a mix of memoirs, biographies and fiction of famous American expatriates in 1920s Paris, was published posthumously in 1999. Personal life Carlile spent much of his later life in Austin, Texas where he had a writing fellowship at the University of Texas. Carlile had at least one child, a son, Steven, and four grandchildren. He died in Austin from cancer at the age of 68 on June 4, 1998.

In the left hand, he is showing a Roman medal of emperor Nero, a symbol of his attention to Humanism. In the background is a lake landscape: Memling was one of the first painters to use natural landscapes for backgrounds of portraits (instead of the traditional black one), influencing later Renaissance artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Pietro Perugino. The identity of the subject is unknown. It has been supposed that he could be one of the numerous Italians living at the time in Antwerp or Bruges, who often commissioned artworks to local painters.

translation systems based on linguistic information about source and target languages basically retrieved from (unilingual, bilingual or multilingual) dictionaries and grammars covering the main semantic, morphological, and syntactic regularities of each language respectively. Having input sentences (in some source language), an RBMT system generates them to output sentences (in some target language) on the basis of morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis of both the source and the target languages involved in a concrete translation task.  History  The first RBMT systems were developed in the early 1970s. The most important steps of this evolution were the emergence of the following RBMT systems: * Systran (http://www.systran.de/) * Japanese MT systems (http://aamt.info/english/mtsys.htm, http://www.wtec.org/loyola/ar93_94/mt.htm) * EUROTRA (Eurotra) Today, other common RBMT systems include: * Apertium * GramTrans  Types of RBMT  There are three different types of rule-based machine translation systems: # Direct Systems (Dictionary Based Machine Translation) map input to output with basic rules. # Transfer RBMT Systems (Transfer Based Machine Translation) employ morphological and syntactical analysis. # Interlingual RBMT Systems (Interlingua) use an abstract meaning. RBMT systems can also be characterized as the systems opposite to Example-based Systems of Machine Translation (Example Based Machine Translation), whereas Hybrid Machine Translations Systems make use of many principles derived from RBMT.  Basic principles  The main approach of RBMT systems is based on linking the structure of the given input sentence with the structure of the demanded output sentence, necessarily preserving their unique meaning. The following example can illustrate the general frame of RBMT: ::A girl eats an apple. Source Language = English; Demanded Target Language = German Minimally, to get a German translation of this English sentence one needs: # A dictionary that will map each English word to an appropriate German word. # Rules representing regular English sentence structure. # Rules representing regular German sentence structure. And finally, we need rules according to which one can relate these two structures together. Accordingly, we can state the following stages of translation: ::1st: getting basic part-of-speech information of each source word: :::a = indef.article; girl = noun; eats = verb; an = indef.article; apple = noun ::2nd: getting syntactic information about the verb \\"to eat\\": :::NP-eat-NP; here: eat – Present Simple, 3rd Person Singular, Active Voice ::3rd: parsing the source sentence: :::(NP an apple) = the object of eat Often only partial parsing is sufficient to get to the syntactic structure of the source sentence and to map it onto the structure of the target sentence. ::4th: translate English words into German :::a (category = indef.article) => ein (category = indef.article) :::girl (category = noun) => Mädchen (category = noun) :::eat (category = verb) => essen (category = verb) :::an (category = indef. article) => ein (category = indef.article) :::apple (category = noun) => Apfel (category = noun) ::5th: Mapping dictionary entries into appropriate inflected forms (final generation): :::A girl eats an apple. => Ein Mädchen isst einen Apfel.  Components  The RBMT system contains: * a SL morphological analyser - analyses a source language word and provides the morphological information; * a SL parser - is a syntax analyser which analyses source language sentences; * a translator - used to translate a source language word into the target language; * a TL morphological generator - works as a generator of appropriate target language words for the given grammatica information; * a TL parser - works as a composer of suitable target language sentences; * Several dictionaries - more specifically a minimum of three dictionaries: ::a SL dictionary - needed by the source language morphological analyser for morphological analysis, ::a bilingual dictionary - used by the translator to translate source language words into target language words, ::a TL dictionary - needed by the target language morphological generator to generate target language words. The RBMT system makes use of the following: * a Source Grammar for the input language which builds syntactic constructions from input sentences; * a Source Lexicon which captures all of the allowable vocabulary in the domain; * Source Mapping Rules which indicate how syntactic heads and grammatical functions in the source language are mapped onto domain concepts and semantic roles in the interlingua; * a Domain Model/Ontology which defines the classes of domain concepts and restricts the fillers of semantic roles for each class; * Target Mapping Rules which indicate how domain concepts and semantic roles in the interlingua are mapped onto syntactic heads and grammatical functions in the target language; * a Target Lexicon which contains appropriate target lexemes for each domain concept; * a Target Grammar for the target language which realizes target syntactic constructions as linearized output sentences.  Advantages  * No bilingual texts are required. This makes it possible to create translation systems for languages that have no texts in common, or even no digitized data whatsoever. * Domain independent. Rules are usually written in a domain independent manner, so the vast majority of rules will \\"just work\\" in every domain, and only a few specific cases per domain may need rules written for them. * No quality ceiling. Every error can be corrected with a targeted rule, even if the trigger case is extremely rare. This is in contrast to statistical systems where infrequent forms will be washed away by default. * Total control. Because all rules are hand-written, you can easily debug a rule based system to see exactly where a given error enters the system, and why. * Reusability. Because RBMT systems are generally built from a strong source language analysis that is fed to a transfer step and target language generator, the source language analysis and target language generation parts can be shared between multiple translation systems, requiring only the transfer step to be specialized. Additionally, source language analysis for one language can be reused to bootstrap a closely related language analysis. Shortcomings * Insufficient amount of really good dictionaries. Building new dictionaries is expensive. * Some linguistic information still needs to be set manually. * It is hard to deal with rule interactions in big systems, ambiguity, and idiomatic expressions. * Failure to adapt to new domains.

He has been described as the best of Roman Catholic propagandists in the bitter pamphlet war of 1553–1558 during the reign of Queen Mary I.Religious Radicals in Tudor England, Joseph Walton Martin Huggarde is stated to have been a shoemaker or hosier in London, and the first writer for the Catholic cause who had not received a monastic or academic education. He lived in Pudding Lane at the northern edge of London Bridge. In 1553 he was made hosier to Queen Mary and allocated a shilling a quarter. But he was not prosperous enough to be made a member of the Haberdashers Company, or a Freeman of the City, or to leave a will. Mary Tudor, under whose reign Huggarde was most active as a pamphleteer The 17th-century antiquarian, Anthony Wood, described him as, \\"the first trader or mechanic that appeared in print for the catholic cause\\". Huggarde exemplified the gradual spread of literacy and printing, and the rising importance of the laity in religious affairs in England. His earliest work, \\"The Abuse of the Blessed Sacrament of the Aultare\\", was written at the end of the reign of King Henry VIII and tackled the denigration of the Eucharist which had developed among some reforming groups. However, he published the remainder of his works during the reign of Queen Mary Tudor, most notable of which was the \\"Displaying of the Protestants, and sondry their Practises\\" written in 1556. Huggarde was noticed by leading men on the Protestant side, and as one of the most indefatigable opponents of the Reformation during the reign of Mary I he attracted a lot of criticism. The writers against him included Laurence Humphrey, Robert Crowley, William Keth, and John Plough. John Foxe reported how the Kent gentleman, Thomas Haukes, had challenged him on where he lived and his trade at a disputation at Bishop Bonner's house: \\"Ye can better skille to eate a pudding and make a hose then in scripture eyther to aunswere or oppose\\".John Foxe, Actes and Monuments, ed. Townsend, vii. 111, 759 Another Protestant opponent, Bishop Bale, also punned on his name calling him 'insanus Porcarius' and 'Milo Porcarius, vel Hoggardus, servorum Dei malignus proditor,' and ridiculed him for endeavouring to prove the necessity of fasting from Virgil's Æneid and Cicero's Tusculanae Disputationes. John Strype spoke of him disparagingly, remarking that \\"he set him self to oppose and abuse the gospellers, being set on and encouraged by priests and massmongers, with whom he much consorted, and was sometimes with them at Bishop Bonner's house.\\" Huggarde was living in the last year of Mary's reign, and in the title-pages of several of his works he describes himself as 'servant to the Queene's most excellent Majestie.' Works *The Abuse of the Blessed Sacrament of the Aultare, a poem, published towards the close of the reign of Henry VIII. Robert Crowley wrote a Confutation, London, 1548, 8vo, with which the whole of Huggarde's poem was reprinted. *The Assault of the Sacrament of the Altar; containyng as well six severall Assaults, made from tyme to tyme, against the said blessed Sacrament; as also the names and opinions of all the hereticall Captains of the same Assaults.

It is also his first composition for orchestra. Of classical structure, it is broadly influenced by Rimsky-Korsakov, Glazunov, Tchaikovsky and Wagner. It was composed in 1905–1907 and revised in 1913. It lasts for about forty minutes.  History  The score bears the dedication \\"To my dear teacher N. A. Rimsky- Korsakov\\". A private performance was given on 27 April 1907 by the St. Petersburg Court Orchestra conducted by H. Wahrlich, in a concert that also included the first performance of Faun and Shepherdess. Stravinsky later recalled that both Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov considered the orchestration \\"too heavy\\". The first public performance was conducted by Felix Blumenfeld on 22 January 1908. A revised version was conducted by Ernest Ansermet on 2 April 1914, and the composer conducted this version in his later performances. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 3 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion and strings.  Movements   Allegro moderato  The first movement is in sonata form.  Scherzo  This movement was sometimes played alone at performances of the Ballets Russes. Stravinsky incorporated into it a Russian folk song similar to one he used in Petrushka.  Largo  The longest movement of the symphony, lasting almost fifteen minutes.  Finale  The finale is a rondo. As in the second movement, Stravinsky includes a popular song (\\"Tchitcher-Yatcher\\"). He used it again in his Trois petites chansons of 1913.  Discography  * Stravinsky's recording of this symphony in his collected works on Sony Classical was recorded by the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in May 1966.

The Oberkommando der Marine or OKM, (the German naval high command), had decided near the end of World War II to put all of its resources into building newer types of Unterseeboot, such as the types XXI and XXIII. U-1308 was part of a batch of eight U-boats (U-1301 to U-1308) ordered on 1 August 1942 to be built at Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, Flensburg (). She was laid down on 16 February 1944 and launched on 22 November. The eight boats were commissioned over a 12-month period between February 1944 and 17 January 1945 . As U-1308 was the last Type VII, the Kriegsmarine fitted her out to be one of the most advanced. U-1308 was one of nine Type VIIs that the Kriegsmarine fitted with an experimental synthetic rubber skin of anechoic tiles known as Alberich, which had been designed to counter the Allies' asdic/sonar devices. U-1308 was also one of two Type VIIC/41s that was equipped with a new design of passive sonar hydrophones, thus increasing detection ranges by approximately 70% over the older designs. A few days before Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, U-1308 was taken approximately north-west of Warnemünde and scuttled on 2 May at approximately . During the final days of Nazi Germany there was a plethora of U-boats which suffered the same fate. In the last week of the war, 28 other boats joined her. Emblem U-1308s emblem was an oak leaf, with an anchor and a knife or dagger. She shared this emblem with , , , and . Complement Commander Heinrich Besold was born on 18 October 1920 in Nürnberg. He entered the navy as Offiziersanwärter (16 September 1939), rising to Fähnrich zur See (1 July 1940), Oberfähnrich zur See (1 July 1941), Leutnant zur See (1 March 1942) and Oberleutnant zur See (1 October 1943). He also served aboard two other U-boats, between March and May 1944 and between July and November 1944. He commanded U-1308 during her working-up at the 4th U-boat Flotilla. He was decorated on 29 October 1944 with the Iron Cross 2nd Class and the U-boat War Badge 1939.

While making a surface attack, a set of large, heavy binoculars were mounted on top of the pedestal. Information of the bearing to the target was transmitted to the control room, where an electro-mechanical computer calculated the exact angle for firing the torpedoes. Sometime late in World War II, an updated version of the UZO entered service with the Type VIIC boats. U-1308 would have mounted the latest version. U-1308, like most Type VIIs, IXs and XXIs, was equipped with two periscopes, one for the attack, the second for the purposes of navigation and search. This observation periscope was frequently used during twilight and night attacks, as it let in more light and had better light transmission. The observation periscope had two magnifications – 1.5× and 6×. The attack periscope was used exclusively for that purpose. To make it less visible to the enemy and to reduce the wake, the periscope head and neck-size were keep to a minimum. The attack periscope was fitted with a heating system that served to prevent fogging of the lenses. U-1308s Direction Finder Antenna Loop was located on the starboard side of the bridge. It was used to detect and get bearings from the radio signals of Allied surface ships. U-1308 would have been outfitted with a late-war version which look slightly different from the earlier model.

File:UBOAT1308_8.png|Direction Finder Antenna Loop (Late war design) - Used to detect a bearing from the radio signals of Allied surface ships. Radar Thetis Thetis was the name of a floating decoy used by U-Boats to confuse Allied warship radars. The device was stored, dismantled, in the bow compartment, as a pole about long. Assembly usually took place in the conning tower, she could be put together in about four minutes. Later versions could be launched from the standard torpedo tube. When deployed it was extended to a total length of , half of which was submerged. The upper half had a series of radar reflectors that were tuned to Allied anti-submarine radar wavelengths to give the same return signal as a U-boat. U-1308 typically carried between 15 and 20 of these decoys. Propulsion Electric Motor U-1308 was powered by two AEG Type GU 460/8-276 double-actingt electric motors. Each motor weighed , without its fan . Each rotor weighed . The Type GU 460/8-276 electric motor could create 1,540 A (560 kW) at between 7.5 Hz (450 RPM) and 10.3 Hz (620 RPM). Schnorchel U-1308 was the last Type VIIC/41 to be built and would have been fitted with a schnorchel, an apparatus to enhance the U-boats' performance below the surface, thus making its position more difficult to detect. Later model Type VIIC/41 boats were built with the device from the start. She would have been constructed with the final version of the schnorchel.

Sensors Passive sonar U-1308 was one of only ten Type VIIC's to be fitted with a Balkongerät (literally 'Balcony apparatus or equipment'). The Balkongerät was used on U-boats (, , , , , , , , and ). The Balkongerät was standard on the Type XXI and the Type XXIII. Nonetheless, it was also fitted to several Type IXs and one Type X. The Balkongerät was an improved version of Gruppenhorchgerät (GHG) (group listening device). The GHG had 24 hydrophones, the Balkongerät had 48 hydrophones and improved electronics, which enabled more accurate readings to be taken.

The code name Alberich was given to the coating. The OKM named it after the dwarf with the helmet of invisibility in Wagner's Ring Cycles. It was the first coating for any submarine. Armament FLAK weaponry U-1308 would have been mounted with a single 3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U gun on the rare LM 43U mount. The LM 43U mount was the final design of mount used on U-boats and is only known to be installed on U-boats (, , , , , and ).

In the early 1890s Norwegian ship-owner Svend Foyn wanted to expand his business to the Antarctic Ocean thereby needing capable ships. Foyn then purchased Cap Nor, made extensive repairs and after completion renamed the ship Antarctic. From 1893 the ship was deployed to the Antarctic ocean for whale hunting. In 1897 the ship was purchased by Alfred Gabriel Nathorst for his planned expedition to Svalbard. Again extensive repairs were made prior to the expedition in 1898. In 1899 Nathorst sold the ship to Georg Carl Amdrup for his expedition to East Greenland. In 1900 Amdrup sold Antarctic to Otto Nordenskjöld who needed the ship for his Antarctic expedition. The expeditions Antarctic leaving Gothenburg harbor, 1901 In 1893 Antarctic captained by Leonard Kristensen set off on a whaling expedition to Antarctica led by Henrik Johan Bull and financed by Foyn. The ship was equipped with 11 harpoon guns, an arsenal of explosives, 8 whaleboats and 31 men and left Tønsberg on September 20, 1893. The first summer was spent around the Kerguelen Islands with winter camp in Melbourne. On September 28, 1894, the ship went off to sea heading for the Ross Sea. On January 24, 1895, a boat was put ashore at Cape Adare at the northern extremity of Victoria Land with six men including Bull, Borchgrevink, Kristensen and Tunzelmann. The party performed the first confirmed landing on the continent of Antarctica, exactly who went ashore first was never cleared as all members claimed the honor (possibly British-American sealer John Davis had already made a landing on the Antarctic Peninsula on February 7, 1821, this claim can, however, not be confirmed)., Norska Nasjonalbiblioteket- National Library of Norway (in Norwegian), accessdate=2010-12-10, Norsk biografisk leksikon-Norwegian Biografical encyclopedia (in Norwegian), accessdate=2010-12-10, South-Pole.com, An Antarctic Timeline, accessdate=2010-12-10, Antarctic-Circle.org, Antarctic voyages and expeditions, accessdate=2010-12-10, New Zealand History online, Ministry for Culture and Heritage, accessdate=2010-12-10 , Norways Forgotten Ezplorer.org, Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, accessdate=2010-12-10 , Antarctica.org, Antarctic History, accessdate=2010-12-10 In 1898 Antarctic captained by Emil Nilsson carried Nathorst's polar expedition to Bear Island, Svalbard and Kong Karls Land.

The ship wrecking Antarctic trapped in pack ice Antarctic sinking After exploring parts of the South Shetland Islands the expedition continued through the Antarctic Sound towards the Antarctic Peninsula. On January 15, 1902 Hope Bay was discovered. In February Nordenskjöld chose Snow Hill Island as winter camp for part of the expedition. After all preparations were completed Antarctic left for the Falkland Islands. After the winter the ship left the Falklands on November 5 heading back to the Antarctic Peninsula by way of Ushuaia for supplies. On December 29 Antarctic was trapped in pack ice near Hope Bay, and some of the crew was put ashore. Antarctic later broke free and continued towards Paulet Island; on the way the ship once again was trapped in pack ice on January 3, 1903. On February 3 the ship again broke free but was now damaged and leaking.

Epitaph When Nathorst heard about the ship wrecking he commented \\"seems to me more glorious than if she had gone to meet the usual fate of vessels to slowly rot in some port, or to be used for something far off from her designation and purposes as an icy seas and research vessel\\". In 1944 Johan Gunnar Andersson published a commemorative book Antarctic :Stolt har hon levat Stolt skall hon dö – Antarctic: proud she lived proud she shall die.

As its name implies it resulted from the merger in 1985 of two magazines Neue Gesellschaft and Frankfurter Hefte. It has existed in its present form since 1985, when the SPD-related journal Neue Gesellschaft, founded in 1954, took over the Frankfurter Hefte, which had been published since 1946 and were originally produced in the left Catholic milieu. History Neue Gesellschaft was a theory journal in the social democratic movement founded in 1954 after the defeat of the SPD in the elections in 1953. Its founding editors were Willi Eichler and Carlo Schmid. Frankfurter Hefte was founded in 1946. It has a left-leaning Catholic approach. Its founders included Eugen Kogon and Walter Dirks.Zeitschriftenkritik: Neue Gesellschaft/Frankfurter Hefte, Angst vor dem Klimawandel, Thorsten Thaler (Retrieved Dec 2010)Neue Gesellschaft/Frankfurter Hefte (Retrieved December 2010) Today, the Neue Gesellschaft/Frankfurter Hefte, sees itself as a political cultural journal that aims to provide both a diagnosis of the times and future perspectives. Since the 1990s, key subject have been the processes of democratisation in Eastern and Central Europe, civil society and communitarian models of society, the confrontation with the totalitarian past, the development of new media, the future of the globalisation and migration.

Hume was the daughter of Jacobean poet and historian David Hume of Godscroft. She superintended the posthumous publication of her father's History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus, published The Triumphs of Love, Chastitie, Death: translated out of Petrarch by Mrs. Anna Hume, and is also said to have translated many of her father's Latin poems. Controversy surrounded her publication of History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus, as William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus, and first marquis of Douglas, was dissatisfied with Hume's work. Douglas consulted Drummond of Hawthornden, who admitted various defects and extravagant views in Hume. Hawthornden, however, did not fight to stop the publication of the work, as be believed that the suppression of the book would ruin the gentlewoman, 'who hath ventured, she says, her whole fortune' on its publication. Drummond of Hawthornden, after observing Anna Hume's commendatory verses, declared himself unworthy of 'the blazon of so pregnant and rare a wit.’ Family Anna Hume's father, Hume of Godscroft, was a Scottish historian, poet and political figure. David Hume fought in many historical wars in Scotland, and was present at battle of Ancrum Moor in 1545 and the battle of Pinkie in 1547. He was captured at Dalkeith Castle by the English in 1548 and remained a prisoner for two years until a ransom was paid. He also sided with Mary, Queen of Scots at Carbury Hill, and commanded 500 horsemen against the English in 1567. His first wife was Barbara Johnstone, and his second wife, Anna Hume's mother, was Mariota Johnstone, known as \\"The Good Lady Wedderburn\\" for her charity work and good influence on the community. Not much is known about Anna Hume's ancestors on her mother's side. Anna Hume's grandfather, David Hume was also an active soldier, who was present at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, where his father and elder brother were killed by the English. David Hume also led a clan against the Duke of Albany in the border wars. He is known for cutting off the head of the French Warden D'Arcie de la Bastle in 1517, after D'Arcie de la Bastle was killed by John and Partick Hume. He married Alison Douglas, daughter of Sir George Douglas. Anna Hume also had six siblings: George, David, James, John, Juliana and Mariot Hume. Her brother George Hume was Collector and Comptroller of the Household to James VI and Queen (1597). Her brother David Hume, was a philosopher and historian who aided her Anna Hume and their father Dave Hume, in writing \\"History of Douglas and Angus.\\" He also aided his father in writing “History of Humes of Wedderburn,” a compilation of the Hume family history. Life Little is known about the life of Anna Hume. Her birth date and date of death are unknown. She is presumed to have lived from the late 16th to the mid- to late 17th century. She came from a titled family, and was born and raised in Wedderburn Castle in Scotland. Works Anna Hume is believed to have translated most, if not all, of her father's Latin poems. One of the greatest admirers of Hume's works was Drummond of Hawthornden. Among Drummond's correspondence is one letter addressed \\"To the Learned and Worthy Gentlewoman, Mrs. Anna Hume, daughter to Mr. David Hume of Godscroft,\\" from which it appears that she had expressed her especial admiration of Drummond in some complimentary verses. \\"Worthy Madam,\\" says Drummond in acknowledgment, > \\"I should be too ambitious, I will not say arrogant, if I thought that > honour which you give me in your delicate verses to be due to the honoured, > and not rather to the honourer. They reflect and turn back unto yourself, as > to a more renowned wonder, that praise by desert which ye bestow upon me of > your mere courtesy. Alas! my muses are of no such value to deserve the > blazon of so pregnant and rare a wit.\\" History of Douglas and Angus After her father's death, Anna Hume was instrumental in getting an edition of his History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus into print in 1644.Vincent, Helen (24 July 2008). \\"The Triumphs of Anna Hume\\" . Weblog post. Imprentit: 500 Years of Scottish Printed Word. In honour of her father's memory and because of the potential value of the book, Hume did all that she could in her power to ensure its publication. She had it printed in Edinburgh by Evan Tyler, printer to the king, in the form of a quarto volume of 440 pages. She also proposed to dedicate the volume to the Marquis of Douglas, and believing it proper that his Lordship should see a book regarding his family, she had sent him an early copy, with a request for his permission. The work told the story down to the death of the good Earl Archibald, 8th Earl of Angus. Controversy surrounded her publication of History of the House and Race of Douglas and Angus, as William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus, and first marquis of Douglas, was dissatisfied with Hume's work, which he believed exhibited various defects and extravagant views: “By confession, Hume had infused his own political opinions and criticisms into his narrative, had not slurred over the rebellions of some of the Douglases, and their conflicts with the Crown, but, on the contrary, had been frank in his commendations at such points, and his explications of the principle of popular liberty as opposed to kingly power.” Historians speculate that Douglas had his own father's History of the Douglases, which he may have been editing by himself with intentions to publish it. After having taken some steps to stop or delay the publication of Hume's book, the Marquis had consulted Drummond of Hawthornden. He had sent Drummond a printed copy of the yet unpublished book, followed by a letter stating his difficulties and the reasons. He requested Drummond, if it were possible, to pay him a visit at Douglas Castle to advise him on what actions are suitable under these circumstances. William Drummond wrote \\"To the Right Honourable, His Very Good Lord, the Marquis of Douglas\\": ::My Noble Lord,— ::A letter by an obscurer hand and a meaner carrier, bearing your Lordship's name, had power to draw me upon a longer journey, and to a more difficile task than the reading of books in your Lordship's castle; and shall at all occasions: but the disorders of these times, and imminent troubles about the place where now I live, shall excuse for a season my not seeing your Lordship, and plead forgiveness. Les Pilieres ou Pilleures de la Republique cut to the gentlemen hereabouts so much work that none can be many days absent from his own dwelling place, especially those whose brains are not fully mellow with their new potions. ::Some days before your Lordship's letter came, I received from the Laird of Gaggy a copy of the history of your Lordship's progenitors in print [Godscroft's book], which I have not yet thoroughly perused. What I have observed on it your Lordship will find on a sheet apart.——This book by these times will be much made of; and above the whole the last part of it, where are discourses which authorise rebellion, and the forcing of consciences, and putting the sword in the people's hand. In a little time more, if our princes shall re-obtain their authority, it may be challenged. Meanwhile, it will be no prejudice nor disgrace to your Lordship's house if by the present rulers of the State the books be suffered to come forth, your Lordship having used the ordinary means to suppress and call them in. The worst which can happen is to put forth a new edition of them, in which your Lordship may cause take away what is faulty, and adjoin what is wanting, with an Apologetical Preface for what was first passed or then came to light.——Your new book [the Marquis's intended edition of his father's history] would bear no author's name, save that it is collected and taken off the original and ancient records of your Lordship's house.——If this book be of equal bigness with Mr. D. Hume's book, the two books cannot be seriously matched and conferred together (as they must be) in one whole month, yea, perhaps two; which time, to my regret, I cannot now have to attend your Lordship at the Castle of Douglas. But, if it would please your Lordship by the hand of your Lordship's son, or Gaggy, to hazard your Lordship's book to be brought to Edinburgh and delivered to me, I shall omit no time in paralleling the two books; and, being nearer many histories in divers languages in mine own study, I can more conveniently peruse them than in your Lordship's castle, where I will be but like an artisan without tools. ::I would request your Lordship to be assured that there shall be nothing within the compass of my endeavours wherein I shall be deficient; and shall remain most willing ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Ever to serve your Lordship, ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::[.] Triumphs Anna Hume also translated the first three of Petrarch's Trionfi (\\"Triumphs\\"). In 1644, Evan Tyler, the king's printer, published Hume's poetry, The Triumphs of Love, Chastitie, Death: Translated Out of Petrarch by Mrs. Anna Hume. Historians believe that the publication of her father's book influenced Hume's decision to have her own poetry printed, as it enabled her to form the connection with a printer. Her decision to publish was relatively unusual for the time, as ladies of prominent families were not often expected to think of professional authorship as a career. The three poems are entitled the “Triumph of Love,” “Triumph of Death,” and “Triumph of Chastity.”Hager, Alan, ed. (2005). . New York, NY: Book Builders LLC. p. 216. The volume prints her translation of Petrarch's The Triumphs of Love- a series of six poems celebrating Petrarch's purported devotion to Laura. The poems tell of Love's triumph over the poet (Petrarch falls in love with Laura), superseded by the triumph of chastity over lust (in that Laura does not yield to Petrarch's love), which is followed by the triumph of death over Laura (as Laura dies and reminds both author and reader of death's power). Hume's address to the reader, found at the beginning of the work, is as follows: :. ::Reader, I have oft been told, ::Verse that speak not Love are cold. ::I would gladly please thine ear, ::But am loth to buy't too dear. ::And 'tis easier far to borrow ::Lovers' tears than feel their sorrow. ::Therefore he hath funisht me ::Who had enough to serve all three.Rowton, Frederic, ed. (1854). \\"Anna Hume, 1644\\". . Philadelphia: Henry Carey Baird. pp. 58–60. Throughout the poems, Hume writes in rhyming couplets, “but each rhymed pair does not represent an individual thought; rather, her sentences bridge several couplets, and a given line of poetry usually begins mid- clause.” The following lines from “The Triumph of Death” show Hume's specific style of writing: ::The glorious Maid, whose soul to Heaven is gone ::And left the rest cold earth, she who was grown ::A pillar of true valor, and had gain’d ::Much honour by her victory, and chain’d ::That God which doth the world with terror bind, ::Using no armour but her own chaste mind. The translation is, on the whole, was considered to be faithful and spirited, and was widely well received. The second half of the Triumph of Love, Part iii., descriptive of the disappointed lover, and the bright account of the fair maids in the 'Triumph of Chastitie,' was admirably rendered. A copy of this work can be found in the British Museum.

Plot Luis, Agustín, Pedro, Ana, and Clara, the five owners of the Los Bohemios cabaret, eventually fall into debt after Agustín spends most of their money on a costly inauguration. Without the funds to repay the debt, Luis and his business partners decide to seek monetary help from his uncle Apolonio Aguilar, an eccentric millionaire rancher, who lives in San Miguel el Alto. When they travel to ask Apolonio to lend them the money, he denies and lies, saying that his millions were swindled from him. Though Apolonio is reluctant to lend money to Luis, he sees his nephew as a potential husband for his tough, orphaned goddaughter Paloma who, in fact, falls in love with Luis. Luis, already in a relationship with Ana, decides to obtain the money from Paloma by inviting her to become a partner of the cabaret, which she misinterprets, believing that he is proposing marriage to her. Paloma accepts and becomes one of the principal performers of the cabaret, showcased as a ranchera singer. Once she discovers that Luis is already romantically involved with Ana (though actually they had broken their relationship shortly before), Paloma becomes disillusioned of Luis and decides to leave the cabaret and travel back to San Miguel el Alto, where she finds Luis, who eventually recognizes his love for her.

A scandal emerged when Bates sold Ann's apprenticeship to her admirer Sir Francis Blake Delaval of Seaton Delaval Hall for £200.

Thereafter, students stay at the school year-round except for summer and winter breaks. Students attend Shanti Bhavan free of charge and are provided with nutritional meals, clothes, shelter, education, healthcare and emotional and mental support. Shanti Bhavan is accredited by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), one of India’s most robust academic curriculums, and administers the ICSE and ISC exams during students' 10th and 12th grades. After students' 12th grade, Shanti Bhavan also pays for their college education. GOPIO News, May 25, 2009 At present, the school accommodates approximately 300 students who come from rural villages or urban slums. A majority (95%) of the students are Dalits - formerly known as untouchables. Due to caste-based discrimination, the students come from extremely impoverished backgrounds, most families surviving on less than $2 per day. Many families experience generational poverty and therefore do not have electricity or running water in their homes. Shanti Bhavan is the only chance for an education that these children have. Students are educated in subjects such as mathematics, history, geography, Hindi, English writing/reading, physics, chemistry, business, accounting, biology, etc. Older students attend workshops in writing, public speaking, and debate. Students are able to engage in sports such as volleyball, basketball, and soccer. Finally, students learn the importance of volunteerism, feminism, leadership, and personal/emotional development. After their Shanti Bhavan education, students go on to join colleges such as St. Joseph's College of Commerce, National Law School in Bangalore, and many more. Current graduates of Shanti Bhavan have obtained full-time jobs at companies such as Amazon, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Yahoo. Furthermore, Shanti Bhavan graduates give back a portion of their salaries to their families and communities, thereby working to extinguish the cycle of generational poverty. History The school was founded by Dr Abraham George, an Indian-American businessman and philanthropist. After serving in the Indian Army, Dr. George attended NYU's Stern School of Business and began his own company Multinational Computer Models Inc. In 1995, he began the non-profit organisation The George Foundation. Shanti Bhavan was established in August 1997 as a project of The George Foundation to help economically and socially disadvantaged children, mostly Dalit children, in rural India - specifically in the Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka regions.The Power of Education NEED - The Humanitarian Magazine In 2008, as a result of the global financial crisis, Shanti Bhavan underwent a financial crisis of its own. Spearheaded by Director of Operations Ajit George, the Shanti Bhavan Children’s Project moved from a privately funded institution to a mixed model of individual donations, corporate and NGO partnerships, and grants. On September 10, 2008, Shanti Bhavan separated from The George Foundation and became a non-profit organisation run under the Shanti Bhavan Educational Trust. As of 2017, Shanti Bhavan has had 8 graduating classes (110 students) and counting. With a 97% high school retention rate and a 98% college retention rate. Its college graduates make more in the first five years of their careers than their parents will their entire lives. Shanti Bhavan students give 20-50% of their incomes to help their families and other children in need. Currently the Shanti Bhavan team is working to raise money to build a second school in India. Mission The organisation aims to provide holistic, quality education to India's most underprivileged children, mostly from the lower caste or the DalitsShanti Bhavan Children's Project - Our Mission to allow them to succeed in the modern global workplace. By breaking the cycle of poverty for these children, while modeling civic engagement and charitable giving, Shanti Bhavan aims to create a generation of changemakers and leaders in India who will go on to uplift their communities out of poverty. Method The school takes in children as young as four years old who are below poverty levelFriedman, p.632. Shanti Bhavan financially supports them throughout their years at the school as well as through college, providing 17 years of support and high quality education. Shanti Bhavan follows the CISCE curriculum; students take their ISCE examinations in their 10th and 12th grades to determine their college placement. The school employs full-time teachers as well as international volunteers, who are given accommodations on the campus. The volunteers support the student's education by teaching classes and providing a global perspective for students' coursework. Students receive a holistic education, including a focus on global events, feminism, leadership development, and guidance on how to cope with the endemic discrimination they face. Cost The cost per student per day at Shanti Bhavan is approximately $4. For one year, pre-K through 12th grade, the cost is approximately $1600 per student. For one college student, the cost is approximately $3200 per year.

Dull finish (specimen ca. 10 cm long) Harz granite () is found in the Harz Mountains of central Germany. It may be divided into five types, all of which were widely used as natural stone: Knaupsholz granite, Birkenkopf granite, Wurmberg granite, Königskopf granite and Ilsestein granite. The first three granites were widely used in North Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands and, later, also in East Germany. Knaupsholz granite was \\"for a long time one of the most important types of cut stone in the former GDR\\".Müller, Friedrich (1991).

Accessed on 12 Dec 2010. \\\\- were formed at the end of the Harz mountain building period (the Hercynian orogeny) during the Late Carboniferous about 300 million years ago. These natural stones were formed when large magma intrusions in the Brocken granite massif solidified at different cooling and crystallization rates into several differently coloured granites. The Harz granites are part of the Brocken granite complex, which is the largest granite complex in the Harz with an area of .TU Clausthal-Zellerfeld: Die geologisch/strukturellen Einheiten des Harzes , accessed on 26 July 2009 The Harzburg gabbro-norite intrusion forms part of this complex, but has a primary chemistry similar to an island-arc tholeiite, although it shows the effects of large scale assimilation of crustal rocks.  Quarries  Among the large quarrying concerns operating before the Second World War in 1938 were the firms of Zureck in Wernigerode (100 to 110 employees), Hannoversche Basaltwerke mbH with its branch, the Wernigerode Granite Quarries (Granitsteinbrüche Wernigerode, 60 to 70 employees), and Braunlager Granit- und Schotterwerke G.m.b.H. (45 employees). There were also 5 to 7 medium and 15 to 17 small businesses with a combined total of 600 employees. Their market at that time comprised the entire territory of the German Reich, Belgium and the Netherlands.Sickenberg: Lagerstätten Niedersachsens, p. 22 In 1948, after the war, 30 to 40 quarrymen were working in the Braunlager Granit- und Schotterwerken as well as an unknown number in another firm in Lower Saxony. There are no exact figures for the numbers of workers in the firms of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The Knaupsholz and Birkenkopf quarries in the GDR and the divisions of the Zureck company in Wernigerode were expropriated on 5 November 1945. Steinbruch Knaupsholz, hrsg. von der Interessensgemeinschaft Harzer Schmalspurbahnen , accessed on 26 July 2009 In the early 1950s, the following quarries in the Brocken granite region were listed by Sickenberg (1951): Eckerloch, Schneeloch, Gebbertsberg, Wurmberg, Haserode, Wolfklippen, Großer und Kleiner Birkenkopf, Knaupsholz, Ottofels, Neustätter Hau, Forsthaus Plessenburg and Gelochter Stein.Sickenberg, Otto (1951). Steine und Erden. Die Lagerstätten und ihre Bewirtschaftung. Geologie und Lagerstätten Niedersachsens, 5th Vol. Dorn- Verlag, Bremen, Horn In 1958, eight quarries were still being worked in the territory of the GDR, but only two were left in 1969 (Knaupsholz and Birkenkopf).Mohr: Geologie des Harzes, p. 413  Knaupsholz granite   Occurrence  Knaupsholz granite was quarried in the Knaupsholz forest district near the small settlements of Drei Annen Hohne and Schierke, a kilometre east of Schierke station in Saxony-Anhalt. Knaupsholz granite was one of the most important building stones in East Germany.  Mineral content  Knaupsholz granite is grey-red in colour and coarse-grained. It contains 33.5% quartz, 45.9% alkali feldspar, 15.1% plagioclase feldspar, 4.8% biotite and chlorite, 0.7% ore minerals, like magnetite, pyrite, hematite, and 0.7 others. The alkali feldspar crystals can be up to 18 mm across.Schwate, Werner (1993). Harzer Granit - Abbau und Verwendung: in Stein 1993 Available online at www.baufachinformation , accessed on 26 July 2009.  Birkenkopf granite   Occurrence  Birkenkopf granite was quarried on the Großer Birkenkopf hill south of Hasselfelde. It is a medium-grained granite with blue-grey coloration. In the quarry 30 to 40% blocks of stone could be used for sawing and 50% of exploitable rock debris could be obtained. The quarry closed in 2009.  Mineral composition  Birkenkopf granite contains 31.3% quartz, 42.6% alkali feldspar, 20.4% plagioclase feldspar, 5.4% biotite and chlorite as well as 0.3% ore minerals like magnetite, pyrite and hematite.  Wurmberg granite  Wurmberg granite, specimen ca. 10 x 8 cm  Occurrence  The quarry for Wurmberg granite was situated about 2.5 kilometres north of Braunlage and 250 metres high on the Wurmberg mountain. The granite was pale red and fine to coarse-grained. The quarry has been closed since spring 1974.Mohr: Geologie des Harzes, p. 414  Mineral composition  This granite contains 31% quartz, 42% alkali feldspar, 20% plagioclase feldspar, 7% biotite, as well as less than 1% of other minerals like zircon, apatite, rutile, muscovite and opaque minerals.Grimm, Wolf-Dieter (1990). Bildatlas wichtiger Denkmalgesteine der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, published by the Bayerischen Landesamt für Denkmalpflege, Gesteins No. 014, Lipp-Verlag. Munich.  Königskopf granite   Occurrence  Königskopf granite was extracted in a quarry near Königskrug, which closed in the 1960s. As a result of ecological restrictions it is unlikely to be reopened again. The granite is light red to intense red (flesh red) in colour.  Mineral composition  Königskopf granite contains 33% quartz, 42% orthoclase with a mineral grain size of 2 to 5 mm up to a maximum of 15 mm, 22% plagioclase feldspar, 5% biotite and 0.7% other minerals.  Ilsestein granite  Ilsestein granite was quarried on the northern boundary of the Harz on the Kleiner Birkenkopf hill near Thale. It was only of local significance, because it had low hardness.  Geology and occurrence  Ilsestein granite lies on the northern perimeter of the Harz and is part of the Brocken massif. It occurs in a vein- like deposit, 11 kilometres long and 2 kilometres wide. The magma of the Ilsestein granite was probably the last magma intrusion in the Brocken complex.Mohr: Geologie des Harzes, p. 226 f u. 236. It is the most quartz-rich granite in the Brocken complex. Its quartz and orthoclase elements grew together. Its utility and hardness as a construction stone is reduced by the numerous geodes, up to 5 cm across.Franke, Dietrich.

Their technical properties make them very suitable for outdoor use, but they are also used indoors due to their appearance. These granites are used as solid building stones for bridge construction, walls, door lintels and window sills, staircase steps, flags, façades, gravestones and, as cobbles and hard core, for roads. Knaupsholz granite is used as stone chippings for trails in the Harz National Park. In 2009, the remaining quarries at Knaupsholz and Birkenkopf (now closed) were providing granite for the following purposes:  Technical construction  Road surfaces, cobbles, walls and bridges in Lower Saxony and North Germany, Magdeburg, Hamburg and Berlin; lock construction and bank reinforcement on the Mittelland and Kiel Canals.  Monuments and buildings  Harz granite has been used for monuments and memorials in Buchenwald, Ravensbrück and Sachsenhausen concentration camps; the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin's Tiergarten and the Soviet Cenotaph in Treptow; interior of the Schiller Museum in Weimar; the mining church in Schierke; the Palace of Culture of the GDR; the Deutsche Bank and town hall steps in Wernigerode.

Synopsis A team of researchers in a remote region of the Atlantic become trapped inside an ancient undersea volcano when their submersible is inexplicably drawn in. They discover a technologically advanced world of genetically engineered, physically near-perfect humans living comfortably in an enclosed city within the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The researchers are told that their Moho- dwelling cousins evolved many millions of years prior to current humans and became very technologically advanced. Millions of years ago, these \\"first generation\\" humans discovered that Earth was about to be bombarded with hordes of meteors, effectively sterilizing the surface of the planet. Unable to find a suitable extrasolar planet to move to in time, the first generation humans decided to instead move into the Mohorovičić discontinuity, shielding themselves from extinction. The Moho-dwellers watched over the centuries as the second-generation humans evolved and developed, and reveal that they abducted these researchers to determine if the researchers had been searching for them. The researchers reveal that nobody on the surface has ever thought there were civilizations living under the Earth's crust, and that they were doing geologic exploration and research instead. Fearing for their own safety and the discovery of their civilization, the Moho-dwellers feel they cannot allow their abductees to return to the surface. The research team manages to recover its submersible and mounts an attempt to return to the surface. However, the Moho-dwellers send one of their interstellar ships after them. The group reach the ocean's surface but, on reaching land, they learn they are in the late 18th century. They realise that the Moho-dwellers have used the time machine function of the interstellar ship to send them 200 years into the past, thus preventing them from being able to alert the surface world to the presence of the Moho-dwellers. Issues/theories present in the novel Genetic engineering: All Moho-dwellers are effectively immortal and can choose to design their new bodies. Euthanasia: Technology exists to extend life, perhaps to the point of true immortality. However, Moho-dwellers can voluntarily terminate their bodies. Death does exist if a Moho-dweller dies before he or she can be \\"transferred\\" to a new body. Paedophilia: The new bodies the Moho-dwellers inhabit begin life at the developmental level of young children, effectively placing the minds of sexually-active adults into the bodies of pre-pubescent children. Hollow Earth theory: This novel is part of a popular genre in science fiction that envisions the viability of life and human survival inside the interior of Earth. References * Cook, R. (2000).

It is a retelling of the stories of Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fenian Cycle.The High Deeds of Finn Mac Cool at fantasticfiction.co.uk According to her own statements in the introduction, these stories are closer to Folklore and Fairytale, being timeless and contradictory, having organically grown from generations of storytellers; she contrasts them to the Ulster Cycle stories of Cuchulainn, which belong to the Heroic Epic, and compare with the Iliad and the Odyssey.Sutcliff, Rosemary: The High Deeds of Finn Mac Cool, pp. 7-8 Plot summary The story begins with the explanation of Cormac mac Art's formation of the Fianna as a defense force for Ireland, which was originally led by Finn's father, Cumhal. Cumhal is killed by Goll mac Morna, who takes over leadership of the Fianna, and Cumhal's wife Muirne flees to give birth to Finn. The boy grows up strong in the manner of his father, studies under the poet Finn Eces, accidentally tasting the Salmon of Knowledge and thereby gaining magical powers, and ultimately regaining leadership of the Fianna by defeating the Fairy that haunts the Court of Tara, Aillén mac Midgna. Goll swears loyalty to him, and Finn rules the Fianna successfully thereafter. Similar to Sutcliff's Arthurian Novel The Sword and the Circle, most of the chapters in this novel are nearly stand-alone tales, covering many of the stories and characters associated with the Fenian Cycle. Some of these include: Finn's courtship of Sadhbh and the birth of Oisín; the tales of Diarmuid and Grainne; Niamh of the Golden Hair; the Giolla Dacker; multiple encounters with the Fair Folk; and ultimately ending with Cath Gabhra and the downfall of the Fianna.

He was the grandson of Edmund Larken and brother of Hubert Larken, Archdeacon of Lincoln. In 1889, he entered HMS Britannia as a naval cadet. His desire to go to sea was encouraged by early experience boating with his brothers on Foss Dyke, he told a crowd in 1935: \\"I do not know that I showed any more aptitude for the sea then than they did, but one day, in a fishing boat at Filey, anchored off the Brig in a nasty swell with a cross tide, they were both very sick a good half-hour before I was.

He wrote the Christmas cantata in Leipzig in 1724 for Christmas Day and first performed it on 25 December 1724. The chorale cantata is based on the hymn \\"\\" (1524) by Martin Luther.  History and words  The chorale cantata from Bach's second annual cycle is based on the main chorale for Christmas Day, \\"\\" (1524) by Martin Luther. The beginning summarizes Christmas in two lines: \\"\\" (Praise be to You, Jesus Christ, since You were born a man). All stanzas end with the acclamation . The cantata was Bach's first composed for Christmas Day in Leipzig; in his first year in Leipzig 1723 he had chosen to perform again , written before in Weimar. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Epistle to Titus, \\"God's mercy appeared\\" () or from Isaiah, \\"Unto us a child is born\\" (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the Nativity, Annunciation to the shepherds and the angels' song (). The unknown poet of the cantata text kept the first and the last stanza, expanded verse 2 by recitatives, transformed stanzas 3 and 4 to movement 3, an aria, stanza 5 to a recitative, and stanza 6 again to an aria. Bach performed the cantata again four more times on 25 December, in 1731, in 1732 or 1733, and twice in the 1740s, even after his Christmas Oratorio had been first performed in 1734, which also uses two stanzas of Luther's chorale.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is festively scored for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, a four-part choir, two horns, timpani, three oboes, two violins, viola and basso continuo. He would later use the pair of horns in Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio. # Chorale: # Recitative (and chorale, soprano): # Aria (tenor): # Recitative (bass): # Aria (soprano, alto): # Chorale:  Music  The opening chorus makes use of four choirs: the voices, the horns, the oboes and the strings. The material from the ritornellos is present also in interludes between the five lines and as accompaniment for the vocal parts. The choral melody is sung by the soprano. The lower voices are set in imitation for the first and the last line, in chords for the second and fourth line, and in a combination in the central line \\"\\" (from a virgin, this is true). In movement 2, the recitative is contrasted with chorale phrases, which are accompanied by a repetition of the first line of the chorale in double tempo. The tenor aria is accompanied by three oboes, whereas the strings illuminate the following recitative. The last aria is a duet, contrasting \\"\\" (poverty) and \\"\\" (abundance), \\"\\" (human being), rendered in chromatic upward lines, and \\"\\" (angelic splendours), shown in coloraturas and triadic melodies. At times the horns have independent parts in the closing chorale and embellish especially the final .  Recordings  * J. S.

The orchestra's primary performing venue is the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts. Prior to the formation of the orchestra, classical orchestras had existed in Memphis earlier, such as the Memphis Symphony Society, which was established in 1939 by Burnet C. Tuthill, head of the music department at Southwestern College. The Memphis Symphony Society consisted largely of amateur musicians who offered four or five concerts each season for several years, but ceased to operate before the 1947-48 season.Roy C. Brewer, Symphony Orchestras, Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, December 25, 2009; last updated February 28, 2011; accessed June 28, 2011 Other organisations which involved amateur musicians in performance of classical music included The Casino Club, the Philharmonic Society, and the Beethoven Club. In 1953, the Memphis Sinfonietta, a chamber orchestra consisting of 21 musicians, gave its first concert at the Goodwyn Institute, under the direction of cellist Vincent DeFrank, with support from the Memphis Orchestral Society and the Memphis Arts Council. The success of subsequent concerts caused the ensemble to begin performances at the Ellis Auditorium. In 1960, the ensemble received its current name, the Memphis Symphony Orchestra, with DeFrank as its first music director. A Ford Foundation grant received in 1963 helped the orchestra to expand its season and increase its audience base. DeFrank continued as the orchestra's music director until 1984. Alan Balter succeeded DeFrank as music director in 1984, and held the post until 1998. In 1996, the orchestra vacated its performing venue when the city of Memphis closed its concert hall in order to build a new city-owned performance venue, the Cannon Center for the Performing Arts. Construction of the Cannon Center was delayed, so the orchestra had no permanent home after 1996 until the Cannon Center opened in 2003. David Loebel became music director in 1998, and held the post until 2010. In February 2010, Mei-Ann Chen was named to succeed Loebel, the first woman to be named music director of the orchestra, effective with the 2010-2011 season, with an initial contract of 3 seasons. During her tenure, the orchestra encountered financial pressures that led to a reduction of concert offerings and a 38% pay reduction for the orchestra musicians. Chen concluded her Memphis tenure at the close of the 2015-2016 season. In October 2015, the orchestra named Robert Moody as its new principal conductor, effective with the 2016-2017 season, with a contract of two seasons, as an interim appointment to allow time for financial stabilisation and a full search for a music director.<. In March 2017, the orchestra announced the elevation of Moody's title to music director, with an initial contract as music director for 6 seasons, effective with the 2017-2018 season.

His parents died at an early age and he was raised by various members of his family living in different areas throughout Pennsylvania, such as Columbia and Athens. He moved to Chicago at the age of 20 in 1868. He first worked as a bookkeeper and then a salesman for the Menominee River Lumber Company. He began investing in lumber on his own. In 1878 he married Erna Sawyer and, with his new brother- in-law, formed the Sawyer-Goodman Company, of which he eventually became president. Goodman is famous for helping to found the Goodman Theatre through a gift of $250,000 made to Art Institute of Chicago. The donation was made in memory of his son Kenneth Sawyer Goodman, a playwright who died at the age of 35 during the 1918 flu pandemic. His son had written and produced a number of different plays throughout Chicago and had envisioned a theater which embraced the best professional training and performance standards. He is also notable for employing architect Howard Van Doren Shaw to build both a tomb memorializing his son as well as his mansion in the expensive Gold Coast District.

With revenues of £20m as of 2015, it is London's largest independent plumbing company.Stuart, Derrick. \\"Christmas is back in business.\\" Conference and Incentive Travel. June 2011. 26. ABI/Inform Complete. Web. 11 Jul. 2011 Establishment Pimlico Plumbers was established in 1979 by its current managing director Charlie Mullins (born December 1952), who left school at 15 with no qualifications and began work as a plumber. Publicity It is known for its effective publicity, handled by Recognition PR and PHA. It was previously handled by Max Clifford. The company owns more than 100 plumbing-related number plates, fitted to its fleet of vehicles, such as LO 02 OLD (Loo too old), BOG1, DRA1N, W4TER and others. It gained considerable publicity through its employment of Buster Martin, who claimed to be Britain's oldest worker, cleaning vans part-time until his death in 2011. The firm's boss presented BBC Three show Britain's Best Young Plumber and has appeared on Secret Millionaire. (archived link, July 15, 2014) The company promotes itself as providing a high-quality service, charging £80–200/hour depending on time of day and service performed.  Legal issues  In 2009, the firm was involved in a legal dispute with Steve Cosser, an Australian TV executive accused of industrial espionage in stealing Pimlico's client list after establishing a rival firm, Service Corps, using ex-Pimlico staff. Services Corps collapsed in January 2010 with debts of £100,000 before the case was settled. The company also had a dispute with rival firm Aspect over Trustpilot ratings. On 10 February 2017, in the Court of Appeal a plumber was found to have \\"worker\\" status for the purposes of various employment protection rights notwithstanding that he had been engaged as a self-employed individual. Pimlico Plumbers argued the plumber was an independent contractor but the Court of Appeal determined he was a worker with some employment rights. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom subsequently granted Pimlico permission to appeal which, following a hearing on 20 and 21 February 2018, was unanimously dismissed. Community involvement and party political funding The firm has been involved in a scheme in aid of the big society with the renovation of the Streatham Youth Centre. This was organised along with Wickes, A4e, and the Co- Sponsorship Agency. In 2018, the company was criticised for erecting a large \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" sign on top of their premises in Waterloo. Mullins defended the use of the sign, referring to the Sex Pistols' 1977 album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols as precedent for being able to legally display the word in public. Financials In November 2010, Mullins reported that he was considering floating the firm, with a £50m valuation, in order to fund a nationwide expansion. The firm turned over £18.2 million in 2013, with profits of more than £1,000,000. Mullins received £1.3 million in compensation in 2009.

The screenplay concerns a young runaway finds his purpose in life after hearing Heifetz play, and the kindly master of a music school in financial difficulty takes him in. Plot Youngster Frankie (Gene Reynolds) and his small gang commit petty crimes in their New York City tenement neighborhood, such as stealing bicycles and taking money from other boys. One of those boys, Willy (Tommy Kelly), complains to his father about this, who takes the matter to Frankie's mother (Marjorie Main) and stepfather (Arthur Hohl). Frankie finds an old violin in his basement which he used to play when his father was around. He then pawns it to get some money to put in the gang's treasury. One day, Frankie and his friend \\"Limey\\" (Terry Kilburn) hide from the police in the lobby of a concert hall. When a couple has an argument, the man disgustedly throws away his tickets. Unable to scalp them, the boys decide to attend the concert. Frankie is entranced by the virtuoso performance of Jascha Heifetz. Later, he sees his violin in the window of a local pawn shop, and decides he wants it back. Frankie steals his little gang's stash of spare change to buy the violin, which he handles with aplomb back in his mother's kitchen. His stepfather comes home and believes Frankie stole it, smashes the instrument, and decides to pack him off to reform school. Frankie immediately runs away, putting his shoe shine gear into the empty violin case as his only possession. He stumbles upon a music school for the poor, founded by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). Lawson discovers that Frankie has perfect pitch and instantly enrolls the boy. That night, Frankie sneaks into the basement to sleep, but Lawson finds him. After hearing his story, he lets Frankie stay. Unbeknownst to Lawson, the school (which does not require tuition fees) is in financial trouble. The school's sponsor has died, and bills have gone unpaid for months. All of the musical instruments are rented from a stingy music store owner ironically named Mr. Flower (Porter Hall). Flower assigns one of his clerks, Peter (Joel McCrea), to collect payment, but Peter's girlfriend is Lawson's daughter, Ann (Andrea Leeds), so he does nothing. When Flower finds out, he fires Peter and goes to confront Ann. Frankie overhears Peter and Ann discussing the situation, and organizes a street band with some of the other students to raise money. They set up right next to a concert hall where, according to clever Frankie, \\"people will like us.\\" When Jascha Heifetz comes out of the hall, Frankie recognizes him and tells him about the school and the fund raising concert they have scheduled. Heifetz is impressed with Frankie and the story and offers to send a film of himself playing. Later, when Flower and the other creditors show up to collect payment, they get the mistaken impression that Heifetz is the school's new sponsor. Peter plays along to buy time, and even claims that the violinist will perform at the school's upcoming concert. Suspicious, Flower goes to see Heifetz and discovers the truth. Limey and the rest of Frankie's old gang try to persuade Heifetz to come, but they are turned away without seeing him. Limey steals Heifetz's Stradivarius violin as a present for Frankie, unaware of its great value. When Frankie tries to return it, he is detained by the police but refuses to talk to anyone but Heifetz. When Heifetz shows up at the police station to collect his instrument, Frankie is able to persuade him to perform at the concert. Heifetz plays to Flower and a rapt audience of the parents of the children, and it appears that the school will now be sponsored by Heifetz.

GALS is a model of computation that emerged in the 1980s. It allows to design computer systems consisting of several synchronous islands (using synchronous programming for each such island) interacting with other islands using asynchronous communication, e.g. with FIFOs. Details A GALS circuit consists of a set of locally synchronous modules communicating with each other via asynchronous wrappers. Each synchronous subsystem (\\"clock domain\\") can run on its own independent clock (frequency). Advantages include much lower electromagnetic interference (EMI). The CMOS circuit (logic gates) requires relatively large supply current when changing state from 0 to 1. These changes are aggregated for synchronous circuit as most changes are initialised by an active clock edge. Therefore, large spikes on supply current occur at active clock edges. These spikes can cause large electromagnetic interference, and may lead to circuit malfunction. In order to limit these spikes large number of decoupling capacitors are used. Another solution is to use a GALS design style, i.e. design (locally) is synchronous (thus easier to be designed than asynchronous circuit) but globally asynchronous, i.e. there are different (e.g. phase shifted, rising and falling active edge) clock signal regimes thus supply current spikes do not aggregate at the same time. Consequently, GALS design style is often used in system on a chip (SoC).Zhoukun WANG and Omar HAMMAMI. \\"A 24 Processors System on Chip FPGA Design with Network on Chip\\".

But, Therese's reputation for her herbal remedies resulted with her being captured by two men in plague masks to be condemned a witch--due to the Black Plague occurring at the time. Although Therese attempts to fight them off when her son unknowingly brought the men to their hut, she is captured while März is tossed into the well outside their home, and she curses the world in her final breath before her execution. The following night, his once white hair stained black - \\"the color of dusk\\" - and no memory of who he was, the reborn Märchen von Friedhof emerged from the well after being awakened by a living doll named Elise. Elise compels Märchen to aid seven \\"princesses\\" in taking revenge in seven tales to achieve their own revenge. Each tale revolves around a deadly sin. The Witch at the Stake The tale of gluttony begins with a mother and child living together in poverty. The husband a money loaner unable to provide for his family, while the mother and child are blamed to be witches and shunned by society. Even if abused, the child is happy to live with her mother and the animals in the forest - her only friends. But when eventually abandoned by her mother, the child was taken by a monastery where she became a nun. The monastery was taken down soon after she took her vows, and so she decided to return home to find the answer behind her mother's actions. Finding the deranged old woman her mother became, the nun offers her a piece of bread, that the old woman greedily devoured. But when the nun asks if she knew her, the old woman killed the nun out of madness for more of the bread, and crucified her daughter's body on an inverted cross. Finding his first \\"princess\\", Märchen decides to use two children to give irony to the nun's revenge on her mother. Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter who find themselves lost in the woods and find the old woman's house. Having inherited her money-loaner husband's fortune, the old woman welcomes the children and feeds them out of regret for not doing so with her own daughter. Seeing Hansel gaining weight, Gretel becomes deluded that their hostess is a wicked witch who waylays children to cook and eat them. This resulted with the children shoving the woman into her oven, leaving her to die in the flames. The two leave to brag of their good deed to their friend Tom, as the three children take the old woman's house as their own. While Märchen comments to Elise on any old woman in a forest can be a witch, the doll expresses her disdain for cruel and dishonest children. The Dark Landlady's Inn A tale of greed that begins with a somewhat dim country girl born in a poor farming village before it was invaded by General Gefenbauer. Like the other girls in her village who were sold away, she came to work for the aged and enigmatic landlady of the Black Fox Inn known for its famous liver dish. But what she did not know is that the landlady obtained her livers from human corpses rather than buy them to maintain her expensive lifestyle, eventually hanging the servant girl to use her liver when the number of corpses begin to run low. Expressing regret that the country girl served as an unwitting accomplice, Märchen reanimates her so she can take revenge by taking the greedy landlady's liver as compensation. Märchen and Elise discuss the flaws of the landlady's get-rich scheme. The Princess Sleeping in the Glass Coffin A tale of envy that begins with the birth of a baby girl whose white skin, red lips, and black hair earned her to name of Snow White by her dying mother. Snow White's father, the king, eventually took for his new wife a cold-hearted and vain woman who possesses a magical mirror that tells her that she is the most beautiful in the land. But when Snow White reached an age where her beauty overshadows her own, the jealous Queen has a huntsman take Snow White deep into the forest and kill her. But the huntsman could not bring himself to commit the deed and, taking the innards of a young boar to put the Queen's mind at rest, lets Snow White flee deep into the forest where he came under the care of seven Dwarves. But the Queen learned of the hunter's ruse, the Queen succeeds in killing Snow White with poisoned apple. Coming across the glass coffin by chance, noting she is not dead, Märchen bids the sleeping Snow White to wait for her fated love and the chance to take revenge. Time passes, and Prince Charming travels through the land before seeing Snow White in her glass coffin. Falling in love at first sight, the prince takes the coffin with the dwarves handing the body over. But when the coffin is dropped due to careless handling, Snow White immediately wakes up as the piece of poisoned apple got dislodged from her throat. As she and Charming set up their wedding, Snow White invites her stepmother to have her be punished for the attempts on her life by being forced to wear a pair of glowing iron shoes and dance in them until she drops dead. The Old and Unused Well of the Boundary That Separates Life and Death A tale of sloth begins with a stepdaughter who is forced to work by her stepmother and her lazy daughter after her father passes. One day, while spindling wool, the stepdaughter pricks her finger and while washing the blood, she accidentally dropped the spindle into the well. After running home, her stepmother and daughter yelled at her to get the spindle back, so the girl, fearing retribution from her stepmother, dives into the well after it. Detecting the stepdaughter's hesitation at taking revenge, Märchen offers her more time to mull over her choices as she wanders into the other world of Mother Hulda, who awards the girl's hard work and kindness by covering her in gold. When the girl returns, the mother sends her lazy daughter down the well to work for Mother Hulda to be showered in gold as well. But the lazy daughter refuses to help in the chores her stepsister did and justly is punished by being forever covered with pitch. While Märchen considers it the cutest revenge he orchestrated, Elise amusingly calls it a fate worse than death. The Princess Sleeping in the Tower of Roses  A tale of pride begins with the birth of an infant girl with fairies are invited to be godmothers to the infant princess while gifting her with blesses. But one uninvited fairy, Alterose, arrives and curses the infant princess to die the moment she pricked her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel on the day of her 15th birthday. Luckily, the last of the godmothers uses her magic to alter the curse into one of a deep sleep until awakened by a prince's kiss. Despite the king's attempt to thwart the spiteful fairy's curse, it comes to fruition years later when the princess is drawn to a room where an old woman is working on her spinning wheel and her curious nature sealed her fate. Having listen to the princess's story, Märchen assures her that her prince will come. Years later, having heard the tale of the Wild Rose Princess, a prince comes across the tower covered in roses and reaches the chamber where the Princess lies asleep on the bed. Upon being revived by the prince's kiss, the princess orders for Alterose's banishment from the kingdom. But as her final revenge, Alterose leaves the princess with a curse to abandon her children in the forest. Märchen and Elise comment that injuring a woman's pride is a dangerous thing to do. The Blue Marquis' Castle A tale of lust that begins with a girl who married a wealthy aristocrat whose previous wives all disappeared under mysterious circumstances. She was given free rein in the Marquis's castle save for one room that she must never enter under any circumstance. Though she promised her husband, the girl later broke her vow while he was away and found the secret room to hold the murdered corpses of the Marquis's previous wives. Her husband has found out when she discovered the murdered corpses of Marquis's pervious wives and her husband told her that he killed his wives because they betrayed him. Her husband tried to kill her as she knew his crime and she screams for help. Her brother arrived and killed her husband. The Crucified Saint Märchen comes to a church and senses a restless spirit in the statue of Saint Solicitous, asking her to tell him her tale. Solicitous explains she was once a noblewoman named Elizabeth whose devotion to her faith was strong to the point of vowing before God that she would never marry anyone. Her brother, attempted to marry her off before he decided to have her crucified. Though Märchen sought to give Elizabeth a wrathful conclusion to her tale, she expresses having not intention for revenge and is only glad to see Märchen again as she reveals herself to be the childhood friend of his true self: März. With Märchen's lost memory restored, it causes his mother's enchantment to be undone as Elise to become inanimate again before Märchen carries her lifeless body away. After return to his mother's hut, Märchen realizes that his life will also fade as he ceases to be as dawn rises on the beginning of an enlightened age. Many years later, a group of children would come to the ruined remains of the hut and find the only proof that Marchen lived: A book titled Fairy Tales of Light and Darkness.

Vanuatu's playing season runs from April to October, during the Vanuatu winter to avoid the heat and humidity of the tropical summer. There are 10 cricket clubs in Vanuatu. History The first reference of cricket being played in Vanuatu is 1905 through English settlers in what was then the New Hebrides, which Vanuatu was a part of. It became organised sometime after which matches involving the settlers and the native New Hebrideans from villages and the capital Port Vila were held for many decades prior to independence. During those decades the matches were played at a single ground. In the 1970s two grounds were built at a plantation half-way around the island of Efate and another at a country club 20 kilometres from Port Vila. In 1995, Vanuatu were admitted to the International Cricket Council as an Affiliate member. Since then the game has grown in popularity, particularly among Ni-Vanuatuan's. Vanuatu's debut in international cricket came in the Pacific Championships against Tonga in 2001. Vanuatu hosted the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup, in which they came third. They have since played in every other EAP Cricket Cup, except the 2008 competition which they did not enter. In 2008, Vanuatu made their debut in World Cricket League Division Five, emerging winless and relegated from the World Cricket League structure. In 2009 they became an Associate member of the International Cricket Council. Their next appearance in the World Cricket League came in the 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division Eight. Their third-place finish in this competition kept them in the same competition for 2012. In April and May 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Vanuatu was largely unaffected by the virus, and the country became the first to resume playing cricket. Governing body Vanuatu Cricket Association is the official governing body of cricket in Vanuatu. Its current headquarters is in Port Vila. Vanuatu Cricket Association is Vanuatu representative at the International Cricket Council. Domestic competitions The BDO Club Championship is the Vanuatu's premier round-robin competition with as many as 10 sides competing each season. The competition is based in Port Vila. Running alongside this competition is an annual Twenty20 knockout competition called the Independence Cup. The final of this competition is held July 30, the date that Vanuatu gained independence from Great Britain and France. Grounds Along with the 2 grounds built in the 1970s, in the past 5 years 4 further grounds have been constructed to deal with an increased interest in the game in Vanuatu. National team The Vanuatu national cricket team represents the country in international cricket matches. The national team, formed in 2001, play in the ICC EAP Cricket Cup and in the World Cricket League, in which it competes in Division Eight. The women's national team debuted in 2011.

He was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990 for his work to prevent deforestation of the Sarawak region. He was a member of the Malaysian Parliament from 1990 to 1995. Life and career Harrison Ngau was born in 1959 at his home village in Long Keseh, which is located near the Baram River in the northern region of Sarawak. In 1976, a logging company named WTK (short form for the company's founder, Wong Tuong Kwang) went to his village. Harrison was a 17-year-old boy who just had just completed second last year of his secondary school at Marudi. He went back to his village for a Christmas holiday when a large meeting convened in his longhouse. The villagers only realised that WTK company had just been granted a concession behind their longhouse when the company turned up with bulldozers, heavy machinaries, and chainsaws in front of them. The villagers initially mooted the idea of stopping the loggers, however when company workers sent them some free biscuits and Coke, the villagers accepted the food and the resistance died down. It was later turned out that two villagers in the longhouse own shares in another logging company who owned the concession. They sold to concession to WTK and made a handsome profit. Since Harrison was the only one who know how write, he offered himself to write letters to the company. WTK later agreed to pay a compensation of RM 2 (US$0.60) for every tonne of timber taken from their area. Harrison then went on to work in a hotel in Miri, an ice factory, and with Shell oil company. In 1980, he started Sarawak branch of Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), an environmental and human rights organisation in Malaysia. He went to Marudi rented an office for his organisation. In November 1980, he was married to 17-year-old Uding, another Kayan from a nearby village. They raised four children and continue to campaigned against logging companies in Baram region. The first protest was at the Apoh river against the Samling logging company. The Kayans from three longhouses went to threatened the company's employees. The company then agreed to pay compensation to the three longhouses. Harrison's organisation was primarily involved in advising the indigenous people in exercising their land rights. In the mid 1980s, the Penan people started turn up to his office when they themselves were also affected by logging. The biggest protest came in March 1987 when 4,700 indigenous people from 26 Penan villages and six longhouses turned up simultaneously to prevent loggers from reaching upper Baram and Limbang region. Around 200 bulldozers and 1,600 timber workers were held up for several months. After a few months, the blockade was forcefully dismantled by the police. On 27 October 1987, Operation Lalang was started by the then Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Harrison was arrested under Internal Security Act. Harrison was flown to Miri and spent a night at a cell there before he was transported to Kuching through an off-road vehicle. He was held for 60 days and nights but no charge was brought against him. Harrison was released in December 1987. Harrison's arrest brought attention to environmental campaigners and human rights activists worldwide. They wrote letters to protest the Malaysian government actions. One year later, SAM received the Right Livelihood Award for Harrison's work in Sarawak. Harrison received Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990. He later used the prize money to fund his campaign against Barisan Nasional (BN) during 1990 Malaysian general election. He defeated the deputy minister of Public Works, Luhat Wan and became the member of parliament for Baram constituency. However, in the 1995 Malaysian general election, he was defeated by another BN candidate Jacob Dungau Sagan.

Civil War In April 1640 Sainthill was elected a Member of Parliament for Tiverton in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected in November 1640 for the Long Parliament but supported the king and was thus disabled from sitting in January 1644. At the start of the Civil War he was one of the 118 Members of Parliament who sat in the Parliament of Oxford, convened by the king in January 1643, and was one of the signatories of the letter to the Earl of Essex on the 27 January 1643. In consequence, the Parliament in their propositions for Peace addressed to the king on 23 November 1644, required that Peter Sainthill, (among others) be removed from Court, and from the King's Councils, be rendered incapable of ever holding office, and that a third of the value of his estates be employed for the payment of the public debt.Gentleman's Magazine, July 1825, p.580, Bradninch and its Antiquities Sainthill was Captain of his local Trained BandGentleman's Magazine, July 1825, p.580 raised in and around Bradninch, one of many raised by the king's Commissioners of Array in Devonshire. In the early summer 1644 the king was in Devonshire, and marched from Plymouth north-eastwards towards Tiverton, himself attended only by his own troop, having ordered the principal officers of the court to go to Exeter in the east, with the royal army to follow him by slow marches, and to be quartered at Tiverton and other towns adjacent.Clarendon, vol. II. p. 539, quoted in Gentleman's Magazine, July 1825, p.580 The king arrived at Bradninch, where he was a guest of Sainthill at Bradninch House for one day and night on 27 July 1644. It was on this occasion that Sainthill is supposed to have loaned the king money for the war effort,The Gentleman's Magazine Volume 90 and that in acknowledgement of such the king inscribed his initials on a wooden door in the house. The royal army duly arrived in the area in September and was quartered in and around Bradninch on 17 September 1644.Lysons, Daniel & Lysons, Samuel, Magna Britannia, Vol.6, Devonshire, London, 1822, quoted in Gentleman's Magazine, July 1825, p.580 Sainthill was appointed as one of the \\"Commissioners for managing the King's affairs in the West\\", and is mentioned by Clarendon in his History of the RebellionClarendon, vol.

Following the surrender of Exeter to the Parliamentarian forces on 9 April 1646, he received a pass from Fairfax, which allowed him to leave with \\"freedom from molestation for himself, with his servants, horses, arms, and necessaries\\",Worthies of Blundell's, p.21 and he set off for exile in Italy. In early in May 1646 he arrived in Leghorn in Tuscany to stay with his younger brother Robert Sainthill (d.post-1665) a merchant, who was agent for Ferdinando II de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany.The gentleman's magazine, and historical chronicle, Volume 95, Part 2 However, shortly after his arrival he died from an illness on 12 August 1648, aged 54.

Marriage and children At Bradninch on 12 May 1614 Sainthill married Dorothy Parker (called \\"Dame Dolly\\" in the satirical verse), daughter and heiress of Robert Parker of Zeal Monachorum in Devon, by his wife Mary. His children included: *Peter IV Sainthill (born 1618), eldest son and heir apparent, died in infancy. *Samuel Sainthill (1626-1708), 2nd and eldest surviving son and heir, who recovered much of his father's property sequestrated during the Civil War.Worthies of Blundell's, p.21 In 1679 he erected the surviving monument to his father in Bradninch Church. He died unmarried and had been expected to appoint as his heir his nearest male relative John Sainthill (1676-1730) of Topsham, Devon, the son of his third cousin. However, \\"having given some offence, the old squire made a more natural choice\\"Gentleman's Magazine, December 1825, p.500 and left his estates instead to his nephew, Edward Yarde (1637-1732), of Tresbeare (son of his sister Dorothea Sainthill), who adopted the surname of Sainthill by Act of Parliament, and being a bachelor of 71, married, and died in 1732, aged 95, leaving one son Edward Sainthill, whose daughter and heiress Elizabeth Sainthill (1764-1843) married Rear Admiral Thomas Pearse (1759-1830),Dates per his mural monument in Bradninch Church; Vivian, p.663 whose mural monument survives in Bradninch Church, and left a son George Pearse (1799-1861) of Bradninch House, the representative of the Sainthills of Bradninch and Yardes of Treasbeare.Gentleman's Magazine, December 1825, p.500 George Pearse was a solicitor and married Raby Hewitt, daughter of William Kellett Hewitt of St Elizabeth, Jamaica, a slave-owner.Legacies of British Slave-ownership,UCL He founded the \\"George Pearse's Educational Foundation\\",Legacies of British Slave-ownership,UCL still extant in the parish of Bradninch today, making grants to (amongst others) \\"Organisations, people of a particular ethnic or racial origin\\".http://opencharities.org/charities/306850 Monument at Bradninch Mural monument to Peter Sainthill, St Disen's Church, Bradninch His \\"very neat and tasteful\\"Gentleman's Magazine, December 1825, Vol.XCV, p.500 mural monument, erected in 1679 by his son Samuel, survives in St Disen's Church, Bradninch, on the north wall of the chancel.

Rosenbloom. Personal Financial Planning: How to Plan for Your Financial Freedom. New York: McGraw-Hill (1975) Yeske and Elissa Buie developed and expanded the concept of Policy-Based Financial Planning. Their article, \\"Policy-Based Financial Planning Provides Touchstone in a Turbulent World,\\" was published in the Journal of Financial Planning in July 2006.Yeske, David B. and Buie, Elissa, Policy-Based Financial Planning Provides Touchstone in a Turbulent World (July 14, 2006). The Journal of Financial Planning, p. 50, July 2006. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1624303 Buie and Yeske subsequently presented the concept at conferences around the world, including two national FPA conferences in the U.S. and conferences in London, Edinburgh, and Manchester. Financial planning policies are compact statements combining client values and objectives with financial planning best practices to form compact decision rules. These decision rules facilitate rapid decision making in the face of changing external circumstances. A good policy is one that is at once broad enough to encompass any novel event and specific enough to always return a clear answer or action. Examples of such financial planning policies include the safe-withdrawal spending rules developed by Guyton and Klinger,Guyton, Jonathan and Klinger, William, “Decision Rules and Maximum Initial Withdrawal Rates,” Journal of Financial Planning, March 2006 investment policies as described by Boone and Lubitz,Boone, Norman and Lubitz, Linda, \\"A Review of Difficult Policy Issues,\\" Journal of Financial Planning, May 2003 and policies for managing debt, charitable-giving, or risk management. Financial Planning Strategy Modes (FPSM) Model As part of his doctoral research, Yeske developed a model for explaining the strategy-making activities of financial planners and relating those activities to measures of client trust and relationship commitment. Since financial planning outcomes are difficult to directly observe and assess (i.e. financial planning possesses \\"high credence\\" characteristics), secondary measures like trust and commitment have been shown to be effective proxies. Yeske adapted a model first developed by Hart and BanburyHart, Stuart and Banbury, Catherine, “How Strategy-Making Processes Can Make a Difference,” Strategic Management Journal, 15: 251-269 (1994) for explaining the strategy-making activities of companies and applied it to the activities of financial planners. The model posits five modes of strategy- making that fall along the dimension of relative involvement by the planner and the client in the planning process. Moving from those approaches that are dominated by the planner to those dominated by the client, the five modes consist of the following: Planner-Driven, Data-Driven, Policy-Driven, Relationship-Driven, and Client-Driven. The model was empirically-validated by testing it against measures of client trust and commitment as conceptualized by Morgan and Hunt,Morgan, R. M., & Hunt, S. D. The commitmenttrust theory of relationship marketing. Journal of Marketing, 58(3) (1994) Christiansen and DeVaney,Christiansen, T., & DeVaney, S. A..

Of the three, the Policy-Driven mode had the most explanatory power, adding empirical support to prior work suggesting that Policy-Based Financial Planning is the most effective way to engage clients. The model also provides a framework for assessing planner competency in terms of the appropriate balance of knowledge/skills across the three main strategy- modes. Competency in all three modes is required to effectively facilitate client adjustment to the various types of change they encounter (environmental, volitional, and life-cycle). While the Certified Financial Planner list of 96 topics is purely descriptive and captures what planners are actually doing, the Yeske model offers a prescriptive approach that is empirically-derived from client trust and commitment.

It is thought to inhabit the deep waters of the continental slope. Reaching at least long, this species has a flattened, ray-like shape and a well-developed tail and caudal fin. It is characterized by the absences of fringes on its nasal barbels and thorns down the midline of its back, as well as by its relatively plain grayish-brown dorsal coloration with dark saddles beneath the dorsal fin bases and a black leading margin on the underside of the pectoral fins. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Indonesian angelshark was described by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) researchers Peter Last and William White in a 2008 volume of the scientific journal Zootoxa, based on specimens found at several Indonesian fish landing sites. One of the specimens, a long female from the Cilacap landing site in central Java, was designated the holotype. The specific epithet comes from the Greek legnotos (\\"having a colored border\\"), in reference to the dark leading margins of the pectoral fins. Björn Stelbrink and colleagues' 2010 phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, found that the sister species of the Indonesian angelshark is the Taiwan angelshark (S. formosa); the two were the closest genetically of all the species examined. The pair additionally formed a clade with the Japanese angelshark (S. japonica) and the ocellated angelshark (S. tergocellatoides), both also Asian species. Distribution and habitat The known specimens of the Indonesian angelshark have come from fish landing sites at Palabuhanratu in West Java, Cilacap in Central Java, Kedonganan in Bali, and Tanjung Luar in Lombok. Therefore, specific information on its preferred natural habitat is unavailable, though it is probably bottom-dwelling in the deeper waters of the continental slope. Description The largest known Indonesian angelshark specimen measured long. As in all angel sharks, it has a flattened body with greatly enlarged pectoral and pelvic fins. The broad, flattened head has a very short, blunt snout and small, widely spaced eyes placed somewhat on top. The eyes are followed by much larger, crescent-shaped spiracles. The nostrils are large and preceded by well-developed flaps of skin that reach the mouth; each flap bears two prominent barbels, which are smooth rather than fringed. The capacious, gently curved mouth is placed at the front of the head. There are long, deep furrows extending from the mouth corners onto and away from the lower jaw. The teeth number around 18 rows in both jaws; each is small and dagger-like, with a single sharp cusp. The five pairs of gill slits are long and placed on the sides of the head. The pectoral fins are angular, with the anterior lobes of their bases free from the head, and their outer tips forming an angle of slightly under 120°. The tips of the pelvic fins are rounded; males have thick claspers. The two dorsal fins are close in shape and size, with rounded to angular apexes and slightly convex trailing margins. The first dorsal originates over the pelvic fins rear tips, and the second dorsal is placed close to the first. There is no anal fin. The tail is rather long, with the caudal peduncle moderately flattened and expanded laterally into keels. The lower lobe of the short and triangular caudal fin is larger than the upper, and there is a notch in the upper lobe trailing margin. The dorsal surface is covered by small, roughly conical dermal denticles. This species is grayish brown above, darkening around the eyes and on the snout and becoming translucent at the trailing fin margins. There are blackish saddle markings below the dorsal fin bases, and sometimes also large, dark blotches and \\"eyespots\\" scattered over the dorsal surface. The underside is almost completely white, with a black leading margin on the pectoral fins. Biology and ecology Little is known of the Indonesian angelshark's natural history. It is presumably aplacental viviparous like other members of its family. The smallest male specimen, an adult, measured long. Human interactions The Indonesian angelshark is rarely caught incidentally on demersal longlines and marketed for meat and fins. If the presently limited Indonesian deepwater fisheries were to expand, this species may be threatened as other angel shark species have shown themselves to be particularly susceptible to fishing depletion. Pending more data, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed this shark under Data Deficient.

Patients are often asymptomatic and the disease is often discovered through investigation of the cause of the heterochromia or cataract. Neovascularisation (growth of new abnormal vessels) is possible and any eye surgery, such as cataract surgery, can cause bleeding from the fragile vessels in the atrophic iris causing accumulation of blood in anterior chamber of the eye, also known as hyphema.  Presentation  This condition is usually unilateral, and its symptoms vary from none to mild blurring and discomfort. Signs include diffuse iris atrophy and small white keratic precipitates (deposits on the inner surface of the cornea), cells presenting in the anterior chamber as well as the anterior vitreous. Glaucoma and cataract occur frequently. Complications * Glaucoma * Cataract * Decreased visual acuity (vision loss) * Iris atrophy Causes According to recent research not a single theory is able to explain the cause fully. However current plausible theories include infection with Toxoplasma gondii, Herpes simplex virus, Rubella, neurogenic causes, and autoimmune pathology.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis is made by an ophthalmologist or optometrist based on the clinical presentation. One indication can be the Amsler sign, which is the presence of blood (hyphema) in the aspirated vitreous fluid, in paracentesis of the anterior chamber. This is caused due to iris atrophy usually seen in FHI and exposure of the fragile iris vasculature to the vitreous fluid. The sudden change of pressure in the anterior chamber upon suction induced by the paracentesis, or during a cataract surgery, causes bursting of the fragile superficial iris capillaries resultsing in micro-bleeding. This is one clinical diagnostic sign of FHI slit lamp examination shows stringy keratic precipitates  Treatment  Patients usually do not require treatment due to benign nature of the disease. In case cataract develops patients generally do well with cataract surgery.

The company announced its intention to install about 6,000 MWe of new nuclear capacity adjacent to the existing Wylfa and Oldbury nuclear power stations. Horizon initially evaluated building either Areva 1,650 MWe EPR reactors or Westinghouse 1,100 MWe AP1000 reactors between 2020 and 2024. In March 2012 E.ON and RWE npower placed Horizon up for sale as a going concern. One bidder was a joint venture of China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group and the China National Nuclear Corporation. However, on 29 October 2012, it was announced that Hitachi would buy Horizon for £696 million, and the sale was completed on 26 November 2012. Hitachi ownership Hitachi intended to build two to three 1,350 MWe Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR) on each site, but first required a Generic Design Assessment (GDA) for the ABWR by the Office for Nuclear Regulation. The assessment began in April 2013, with an agreement that the costs of assessment would be covered by Hitachi-GE. In August 2014, the proposed reactor type reached the third stage, out of four, in the GDA process. In 2013, Horizon planned initial site work at Wylfa to begin in 2015, with building work starting in 2018 and generation starting in the mid-2020s. However later Horizon delayed the start of site work until after the GDA is completed. In January 2016, Hitachi announced a new UK company, Hitachi Nuclear Energy Europe, to lead a proposed joint venture with Bechtel and JGC Corporation, to cover the engineering, procurement and construction of Horizon's nuclear plants in the UK. Horizon Nuclear Power would continue to work on obtaining regulatory consents and making commercial arrangements. However, later in the month Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman and chief executive of Hitachi, expressed serious concerns to the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond over financing the scheme, following EDF's difficulty in financing Hinkley Point C. Hitachi negotiated with the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on electricity price guarantees, called Contracts for Difference (CfD). The first project at Wylfa would be financed externally, with Hitachi only taking a minority stake. In May 2016, Duncan Hawthorne, previously CEO of Bruce Power in Canada, was appointed CEO of Horizon. In February 2017 Horizon contracted U.S. Exelon to provide expert staff to assist in developing Horizon's nuclear operating model. The ABWR GDA process completed successfully in December 2017. As of 2017, Horizon planned to build two ABWRs at each site, subject to finance and contract agreement. Horizon believed that the consensus of government and industry was that the Contract for Difference financing model used for Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, involving fully private sector financing, would not be used for subsequent nuclear plants, and discussions were held with government about alternative financing models. Hawthorne, Horizon CEO, stated \\"We are an insurance policy for a long-term stable supply and there is a price for that certainty\\". In December 2018, Hitachi's chairman stated they were struggling to find investors for the Wylfa plant. Later TV Asahi in Japan reported that the Wylfa scheme may be scrapped, resulting in an increase in the value of Hitachi’s shares. On 17 January 2019, Horizon announced that \\"it will suspend its UK nuclear development programme, following a decision taken by its parent company Hitachi\\". The UK government had been willing to take a one-third equity stake in the project, to consider providing all the required debt financing, and to provide a Contract for Difference for the electricity generated at up to £75/MWh for 35 years. Greg Clark, minister for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, stated this was a \\"generous package of potential support that going beyond what any government had been willing to consider in the past\\". However this did not provide an adequate \\"economic rationality as a private enterprise\\" for Hitachi to proceed. Hitachi had spent nearly £2 billion on Horizon since 2012, and the Wylfa ABWR development had been expected to cost about £15 billion. Following the suspension, Horizon made most of its 380 staff redundant, retaining just a few site maintenance staff and those involved in governmental discussions about possible future funding of the development. In April 2020 a director of Horizon stated that the future of next two nuclear builds, Wylfa and EDF's Sizewell C, depended on the government accepting the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) financial assistance model rather than the existing Contract for Difference support mechanism, which would allow developers to need less upfront private finance as some finance would be backed by end consumer billing. In June 2020 The Sunday Times reported that the U.S. government had warned Hitachi not to sell Horizon to Chinese companies for security reasons. Horizon responded there were no such plans, and stated \\"We don't comment on speculation. Our focus remains on securing the conditions necessary to restart this crucial project, which would bring transformative economic benefits to the region and play a huge role in helping deliver the UK's climate change commitments.\\" Shortly after, in August, the FT reported that the British government and Hitachi have recently been in talks over the possibility of resumption of Horizon's operation. In September 2020, Hitachi announced its withdrawal from the Wylfa and Oldbury projects, due to the lack of progress in the 20 months since suspending the project, and to the difficult investment environment following the COVID-19 pandemic. Horizon will close down its development activities, but will work with the UK government and other stakeholders to facilitate future options for the two sites.

Netscape, 354 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2004) was a case regarding trademark infringement and trademark dilution decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Playboy Enterprises Inc. took legal action against Netscape Communications Corp. and Excite, Inc., accusing them of infringement and dilution of Playboy's marks \\"playboy\\" and \\"playmate\\".http://www.internetlibrary.com/cases/lib_case336.cfm Facts Netscape allows advertisers to target specific users of its search engine by displaying certain ads to certain people, depending on what the user searches for. The display and profiting of ads by a search engine operators such as Netscape is referred to as \\"keying.\\" This \\"keying\\" technique is considered more effective than random ads. Netscape uses this technique for adult entertainment and has a list of terms for which to display related ads. This list contains the terms \\"playboy\\" and \\"playmate\\" which are trademarked by Playboy. Netscape displays ads for various companies in response to those search terms, which includes Playboy's competitors. Playboy claims that Netscape's use of those terms in its keying technique constitutes trademark infringement. In addition, by displaying competitor's ads that are not obviously from a competitor at first glance, Playboy claims that Netscape has committed trademark dilution. Netscape displayed banner ads of a company similar to Playboy, however Netscape did not specify the secondary company's name. Playboy argued that, upon viewing their banners and those of the other company similar in nature, the user would become confused and assume they were both under ownership of Playboy Enterprises, Inc. This action is legally considered trademark infringement under the initial interest confusion act. According to the Ninth Circuit, failing to sufficiently identify the source of a banner advertisement could result in trademark infringement on the part of the search engine operator in accordance with the 'initial interest confusion' doctrine. There is no infringement provided the ads are properly labeled and identified with the advertiser's marks as the consumer is aware of the source of the advertisement and the definite website to which the advertisement will direct him. The defendants profited from the plaintiff by keying through the display of banner ads in conjunction with one of four hundred search terms which included \\"Playboy\\" and \\"playmate\\", two of the plaintiff's registered trademarks. The defendants has multiple advertisers whose ad banners would display upon the presence of these search terms. The ads were not required by the defendants to be identified as to their source. Thus upon the search of the plaintiff's registered marks Playboy and Playmate, outside advertisers were able to connect their banners to these search queries without the need to specify the ad's source to the patrons browsing the web. Procedural history PEI sued Netscape, asserting that they were using PEI's marks in a manner that infringed upon and diluted the marks. The district court denied PEI's request for a preliminary injunction, and the appeals court affirmed in an unpublished disposition. On remand, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The United States District Court for the Central District of California granted summary judgment for Netscape. PEI appealed. Decision The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed Playboy Enterprises, Inc. to proceed with their claims of trademark infringement and dilution by Netscape and Excite according to the \\"initial interest confusion\\" doctrine established by Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp. in the Ninth Circuit.http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/ Using this decision as reference, the plaintiff could claim such confusion by demonstrating that consumers believe the banner ads displayed with the results of their search for the plaintiff's registered marks are sponsored by or associated with Playboy Enterprises, Inc. Despite the customer's later knowledge that the products they are purchasing are in fact not from Playboy, the competitor getting business is unfairly profiting off of Playboy's goodwill and registered marks. The Ninth Circuit employed an eight-factor test, originally set forth in AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, to determine the likelihood of confusion. Because each factor is weighted differently and some factors are more important than others, the court started with factor four. The eight factors are: Factor One: Strength of the Mark PEI established that a strong secondary meaning for its descriptive marks existed, and that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether it created the secondary meanings. Thus, the first Sleekcraft factor favored PEI. Factor Two: Proximity of the Goods From an Internet searcher's perspective, the relevant \\"goods\\" are the links to the websites being sought and the goods or services available at those sites. The proximity between PEI's and its competitor's goods provides the reason Netscape keys PEI's marks to competitor's banner advertisements in the first place. Accordingly, this factor favored PEI as well. Factor Three: Similarity of the Marks. No doubt exists regarding this factor. Aside from their lack of capitalization, their font, and the fact that Defendant Netscape used the plural form of \\"playmate,\\" the terms Netscape used are identical to PEI's marks. Thus, they were found \\"certainly similar.\\" Factor Four: Evidence of Actual Confusion The court found in favor of PEI for factor four because the expert study PEI introduced established a strong likelihood of initial interest confusion among consumers. Thus, factor four alone sufficed to reverse the grant of summary judgment but in the interest of being thorough, however, the court examined the other seven Sleekcraft factors. Factor Five: Marketing Channels Used This factor is equivocal. The court found that PEI and the advertisers used identical marketing channels: the Internet. More specifically, each of their sites appeared on Netscape's search results pages. Given the broad use of the Internet today, the same could be said for countless companies. Thus, this factor merited little weight. Factor Six: Type of Goods and Degree of Consumer Care Expected This factor favored PEI. Consumer care for inexpensive products is expected to be quite low. Low consumer care, in turn, increases the likelihood of confusion. In addition to price, the content in question affected consumer care as well. The court presumed that the average searcher seeking adult-oriented materials on the Internet is easily diverted from a specific product he or she is seeking if other options, particularly graphic ones, appear more quickly. Thus, the adult-oriented and graphic nature of the materials weighed in PEI's favor as well. Factor Seven: Defendants' Intent in Selecting the Mark This factor favored PEI somewhat. A defendant's intent to confuse constitutes probative evidence of likely confusion: Courts normally assume that the defendant's intentions were carried out successfully. In this case, the evidence did not definitively establish defendants' intent. At a minimum, however, it did suggest that defendants did nothing to prevent click-throughs that resulted from the confusion. Moreover, Netscape profited from such click-throughs. Factor Eight: Likelihood of Expansion of Product Lines Because the advertisers' goods and PEI's were already related, as discussed within factor two, this factor was found to be irrelevant. Defenses to Infringement Having examined all of the Sleekcraft factors, the court concluded that the majority favor PEI. Accordingly, the court concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the substantial likelihood of confusion. The court then proceeded to the defenses advanced by defendants. Defendants assert three defenses: fair use, nominative use, and functional use. Because the court found that a genuine issue of fact existed as to likelihood of confusion under Sleekcraft, the court denied summary judgment as to the fair use defense. A fair use may not be a confusing use. Accordingly, the court turned to defendants' other asserted defenses. Defendants Netscape asserted that they make a nominative use of PEI's marks. The court applied a slightly different test for confusion in the nominative use, as opposed to the fair use, context. To be considered a nominative use, the use of a mark must meet the following three-factor test, as originally stated in PEI v. Welles: First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. Before the court applied this test to the facts, the court emphasized what facts were not at hand. It noted that defendants' use of PEI's marks to trigger the listing of PEI sites, and other sites that legitimately use PEI's marks, was not at issue. In addition, it noted that it is not addressing a situation in which a banner advertisement clearly identified its source with its sponsor's name, or in which a search engine clearly identifies a banner advertisement's source. The court stated that it also did not address a situation in which advertisers or defendants overtly compare PEI's products to a competitor's—saying, for example \\"if you are interested in Playboy, you may also be interested in the following message from[a different, named company].\\" Rather, the court acknowledged it was evaluating a situation in which defendants display competitors' unlabeled banner advertisements, with no label or overt comparison to PEI, after Internet users type in PEI's trademarks. PEI v. Welles The situation with which the court was dealing runs afoul of the first requirement for nominative use. Accordingly, it did not consider the other prongs. Defendants could have used other words, besides PEI's marks, to trigger adult-oriented banner advertisements. Indeed, it was found that they already did so. The list they sold to advertisers included over 400 terms besides PEI's marks. There is nothing indispensable, in this context, about PEI's marks. Defendants did not wish to identify PEI or its products when they key banner advertisements to PEI's marks. Rather, they wished to identify consumers who are interested in adult-oriented entertainment so they can draw them to competitors' websites. Accordingly, their use is not nominative. Thus, the court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment based on nominative use. Trademark Dilution The plaintiff's claim for trademark dilution was remanded by the Ninth District Court to the District Court, who was given instruction to apply the case of Mosley v. V Secret Catalogue, recently decided by the Supreme Court. The Ninth District Court concluded that the infringement only applied to those ad banners which contained no identification of source as these were the only ones subject to consumer confusion. Conclusion Genuine issues of material fact exist as to PEI's trademark infringement and dilution claims. Accordingly, the court reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and remand for further proceedings.  See also  * Brookfield Communications, Inc. v.

With a performance area spanning more than 20,000 square feet [1], it is one of the largest haunts in Florida. Unlike the corporate haunts with which it competes, Terror of Tallahassee doesn’t admit patrons in a continuous line, but rather, in small groups. It also forgoes modern animatronics in favor of elaborate illusions, gruesome special effects, and a large cast of performers [1]. “Monsters, murderers, and madmen menace isolated customers as they try to traverse the long, twisting passages in the dark\\" [2]. Because of the intense scares, it is rated PG-13 and parents are cautioned against sending their kids [3]. Sample Poster from the Terror of Tallahassee History Three giant warehouses make up the main building. They were originally part of an F-R-M grain depot built in 1950, but it was closed for a number of years before the property sold in 1999. The new owners gutted the steel building and rebuilt the interior into a giant maze with secret passages for the staff to surprise patrons. It was opened as Nightmares Haunted House in September 2000. It lasted two seasons before closing in 2001. It reopened in 2002 as Bloodlines Haunted House, but again closed. It reopened under new management in 2003 as Terror of Tallahassee and has grown ever since [4]. Spook Show Influence Many of the special effects used at the Terror of Tallahassee originated in the traveling spook shows of yesteryear [5]. During the mid-20th century, magicians including Bill Neff, Jack Baker, Ray- mond Corbin, and Phillip Morris spellbound millions with black magic shows held in movie theaters at midnight. Their dark performances would feature decapitations, cremations, disintegrations, and similar macabre illusions [6]. Such magicians were called “Ghost Masters,” but the Spook Shows slowly disappeared in the 1970s as older theaters were closed and rebuilt without stages. Kurt Kuersteiner, the managing director at Terror of Tallahassee, traveled the country to meet the surviving Ghost Masters in 2005 while directing a documentary on their craft. As a result, many of the classic illusions they pioneered have been resurrected at the haunt [7]. Sunland Asylum Another influence on the attraction was Tallahassee’s legendary Sunland hospital [8]. Closed in the 1980s, it was originally built as the W.T. Edwards Tuberculosis Hospital, where many T.B. patients were quarantined until their death. It was closed and reopened in the 1968 as Sunland, a hospital housing children with mental disabilities. It became infamous for patient neglect and allegations of cruel and “sub-human” treatment. The dilapidated building was closed for good in 1983 and was widely believed to be haunted. The controversial hospital and its unfortunate inhabitants are recreated in a segment of the haunt. It features equipment salvaged from the hospital before it was demolished in 2006 and further boasts, “(that) the spirits came along for the ride at no extra charge!” [9]. Spine Tingler The Terror of Tallahassee is also the first public testing facility for the “Spine Tingler” [10], a specially designed rotary woofer that reproduces the subsonic sound spectrum (0 to 20 Hz). Although most of the sound is too low for humans to hear, they can subliminally detect it as the air pressure in the building is affected (see: Infrasound). Advocates claim it “tingles the nerves” [11] and enhances the feelings of a supernatural experience. Community Theater Terror of Tallahassee is staffed by an army of volunteers, much like a community theater. Many of the actors return year after year. Most of the props, illusions and scenes are custom designed and built from scratch by the same performers [12]. Although the building is closed eleven months out of the year, the staff continues to build and modify it during the off-season. Management boasts that this provides a unique experience not found anywhere else. Future Fate Since the first year it opened, Terror of Tallahassee has operated under the shadow of the Gaines Street Revitalization Project. The original goals of the project threatened to demolish the haunt in order to expand the road beside it, but new plans in 2009 called for reducing the width of Gaines Street instead [13]. However, other changing goals of the project and the resulting gentrification continued to threaten the long-term prospects of the attraction at its original location. UPDATE: The property was sold and demolished in 2014. The actual haunt, however, moved a half mile away to 1408 Lake Bradford Road and continues to operate every October at a giant, abandoned stone cutting factory.

While the aircraft demonstrated excellent manoeuvrability, only a single example was built. Design and development The London and Provincial Aviation Company was founded in September 1914 running a flying school at Hendon Aerodrome equipped with single seat Caudron biplanes, which it later built under license for use at the school.McKay Air Enthusiast January/February 2000, p. 70.Bruce 1957, p. 292. In 1916, A. Fletcher, previously employed at Martin & Handaside and responsible for the design of the Martinsyde Elephant, joined London and Provincial.McKay Air Enthusiast January/February 2000, p. 71. Fletcher's first design for London and Provincial, known as the \\"Fuselage\\" biplaneFlight 27 July 1916, p. 623. or School Biplane was a single-engined tractor two-bay biplane powered by an 80 hp (60 kW) Anzani 10-cylinder engine. It was of wooden construction, with a rectangular section fuselage. It had a conventional landing gear, while ailerons were fitted to all four wings.Bruce 1957, p. 293. It had two separate cockpits, with the pilot sitting in the rear one. The front cockpit could carry a single passenger, who was not provided with any flying controls. The first Fuselage Biplane made its maiden flight in July 1916. While it proved to have excellent manoeuvrability,being easily looped, only a single example of the Fuselage biplane was built. Fletcher had produced a second design for London and Provincial, a single seat tractor biplane powered by a 50 hp (37 kW) Gnome Omega rotary engine, intended as an intermediate trainer, but this was abandoned in October 1916 before completion, causing Fletcher to leave the company.McKay Air Enthusiast January/February 2000, pp. 71–72. Operational history Although the primary business of London and Provincial was training pilots for the British armed services, the Fuselage Biplane, lacking dual controls, was not used as a trainer, being used for joy-riding purposes and for parachute trials. Following the end of the war, the Fuselage Biplane was used as the basis for a new two seat aircraft, powered by a 50 hp Gnome. The new aircraft was of crude construction compared with the 1916 aircraft which had attracted praise in the aviation press, and rather than the individual cockpits of the earlier aircraft, it had a single large cockpit. Four of the new design were built, being used for joy-riding from London and Provincial's Stag Lane Aerodrome. The new, large cockpit proved to be a major weakness, as it weakened the fuselage, allowing it to bow in and out while taxiing. This, together with the use of the Gnome rotary engine, with only single ignition, resulted in the Air Ministry refusing a Certificate of Airworthiness for the new aircraft.McKay Air Enthusiast March/April 2000, pp. 4–5.

Several suspects have been named but none were arrested or charged, and a serial killer is believed to be responsible. Authorities were able to track the murders to a larger sex trafficking ring from Central America, operating through neighboring Texas, that targets sex workers during events throughout the Southwest, Southern, and Western United States, especially regularly scheduled events, such as the New Mexico state fair in this case, to take advantage of reliably heavier traffic.\\"Fair prostitutes help West Mesa murders\\" Krqe.com.

Background Between 2001 and 2005, 11 women were buried by an unknown assailant in an arroyo bank on Albuquerque's West Mesa, in an undeveloped area within city limits. Satellite imagery taken between 2003 and 2005 shows tire marks and patches of disturbed soils in the area where the remains were recovered. By 2006, development had encroached on the area, and soon after, the site was disturbed, buried, and platted for residential development. Due to the 2008 Housing Bubble collapse, development on the west side halted before housing could be built at the burial site. After neighbors complained of flooding at the platted site (due to the burial of the natural arroyo), the developer built a retaining wall to channel storm water to a retention pond built in the approximate area of the burial site, inadvertently exposing bones to the surface. Discovery On February 2, 2009, a woman walking a dog found a human bone on the West Mesa, and reported it to police. As a result of the subsequent police investigation, authorities discovered the remains of 11 women and girls and a fetus buried in the area. They were between 15 and 32 years of age, most were Hispanic, and most were involved with drugs and prostitution.

In one case, there was a DNA sample but the rape test kit was not re-tested until 2010, eventually linking Blea to the rape. In 2015, Blea was also suspected by police of killing a sex worker; his DNA sample was located on the inner waistband and belt of a sex worker found dead on Central Ave, a notorious street for sex work in the eastern part of the city. In addition, a tree tag from a nursery was found in the area where the West Mesa victims' bodies were buried; it was tracked to a nursery Blea once frequented.

An American squadron of three vessels attacked three British armed whalers, and captured them. The engagement was notable for being one of the few to occur in the Pacific Ocean during the war and involved United States Marine Lieutenant John M. Gamble, the first U.S. Marine to command an American warship. Background In the War of 1812 between the United Kingdom and the United States, American Captain David Porter, in the thirty-six gun frigate , led a fleet of armed vessels in the South Pacific in a commerce raiding operation. At the time of the action, Essex was accompanied by two smaller vessels, recently captured from the British and classified as sloops-of-war by Captain Porter. They were the 10-gun of 338 tons burthen and the 8-gun of 280 tons burthen. Porter had sent the rest of his fleet to Valparaiso, Chile, to be sold while he and the remaining vessels patrolled for British whalers between Tumbes, Peru and the Galapagos. Because Porter had entered the Pacific with no more than 350 American servicemen under his command, when he took prizes he could only place small skeleton crews in most of his ships. Georgiana had a complement of forty-two men under Mr. Adams, the Essexs chaplain, and Greenwich held only fourteen men under the command of Lieutenant Gamble, USMC. Action John M. Gamble There is some confusion as to the date of the battle; in later memoirs, Lieutenant Gamble recalled that it was fought on 12 or 13 July, while Captain Porter's memoir, and letters from Porter to Gamble, stated that it occurred on 14 July. Either way, at about 11:00 AM the Americans were sailing west from Tumbes, Peru, off Banks Bay (Bahia de Bancos) in the Galapagos, when they sighted three sets of sails on the horizon. Commodore Porter signaled his ships to prepare for action and a chase began. At the time, the majority of British ships cruising in the South Pacific were whalers sailing under letters of marque, legally permitting them to act as privateers should the opportunity arise.All the vessels that Porter captured had crews whose size was more consistent with their being letters of marque than privateers. Vessels intending to engage in privateering had large crews, larger even than those of similarly-sized naval vessels, in order to be able to put prize crews on board their captures, while continuing to hunt for more prey. Porter himself suffered from having too few men to man adequately all his prizes. The first British vessel Porter captured was the brig of ten guns. Charlton was sailing in the center of the three ships, and she surrendered to Essex without a fight as Greenwich and Georgiana went after . Seringapatam had made several whaling and sealing voyages to the South Atlantic and this area since 1800. She had a 41-man crew under the command of Captain William Stavers and was armed with fourteen 9-pounder guns. On this voyage she had captured one American whaler on the way to the whaling grounds. When escape seemed unlikely, Seringapatam changed course and appeared to be sailing to engage Greenwich but the latter came to a halt and waited for Georgiana to come up and provide assistance. At this point, as four men were transferred from Georgiana to Greenwich, Captain Stavers chose to break off the attack and flee. Lieutenant Gamble closed the distance between the two ships and he first demanded that the British surrender. But when the Americans came within pistol range, Seringapatam raised her colors and fired a powerful broadside. Greenwich immediately returned fire with small arms and cannon, and for several moments the two vessels exchanged fire. American fire proved to be more accurate, and after taking heavy damage the British struck their colors and Greenwich ceased her firing. Just as Lieutenant Gamble was preparing to board the enemy, Seringapatam attempted another escape. Gamble ordered his men to resume shooting at the sails of the British vessel and eventually brought her to a halt. Meanwhile, Essex had finished pursuing the small 8-gun and captured her without difficulty. Captain Porter then assisted in chasing down Seringapatam. Aftermath Captain Porter's fleet off Nuku Hiva in October of 1813. American sources make no mention of casualties on either side, though Greenwich sustained some damage and Seringapatam was crippled. Porter took 89 prisoners in all, and the American ships were already filled with captives, so the Americans disarmed Charlton, loaded her with 48 of the prisoners, and sent her to Rio de Janeiro as a cartel with the prisoners under parole with orders to surrender to the first American authority they encountered. Lloyd's List reported that Essex had captured Seringapatam, Stavers, master; New Zealander, Donneman, master; and Charlton, Halcrow, master.Lloyd's List, 11 January 1814 - accessed 11 November 2013. Captain Stavers, when asked to surrender his privateer's commission, revealed that though he had applied for a letter of marque, he had not yet received one, but that it was probably waiting for him in Lima. Captain Porter announced that Stavers would be taken to the United States and be tried as a pirate, and ordered him and his crew to be put in irons. They were given more freedom after some liberated American whalers told Porter that the British had treated them well during their time as prisoners aboard Seringapatam. The American press declared Seringapatam to have been a formidable threat to American commerce in the Pacific, making Lieutenant Gamble famous, with the consequence that he received many letters of congratulations from naval officers. Seringapatam was found to have carried up to 30,000 dollars worth of armaments and provisions. Gamble was promoted to captain and died in 1836 as a lieutenant colonel. However, despite a petition to the U.S. Congress, he never received any prize money for the capture or his subsequent service. Following the engagement, Captain Porter made for Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas where he built America's first base in the Pacific and repaired his ships. He then sailed off, leaving Greenwich, Seringapatam, and another prize, , behind. It was after his departure that the Seringapatam Mutiny occurred. The mutineers and British prisoners-of-war recaptured Seringapatam and sailed her to Australia, from where she was returned to her owners. Gamble burned Greenwich before leaving Nuka Hiva in Sir Andrew Hammond.

He briefly enjoyed a political career, being elected to the House of Commons by the narrowest majority under universal franchise and serving for a single term as a supporter of National Labour. His contributions to Parliament were not substantial but his subsequent legal career flourished and he was a later made a judge. Family and early life Flint was the son of Abraham Reginald Flint, who was a solicitor in Derby,\\"A Who's Who of British MPs\\" ed. by Michael Stenton and Stephen Lees, vol. III, Harvester Press, 1979, p. 117-8. and spent 40 years on Derby City Council.The Times, 4 November 1954, p. 6. Flint was educated at Oundle School. In 1921, Flint went abroad and spent four years farming in New Zealand.\\"The Times House of Commons 1931\\", p. 69. On his return, he studied law, and was called to the Bar in 1929 from the Inner Temple. The next year, Flint married Eleanor Mary Jones, who was from Loughborough; they had two daughters together.\\"FLINT, His Honour Judge Flint Abraham John\\" in \\"Who Was Who 1971–1980\\", A & C Black. 1931 general election Up until the political crisis of 1931, Flint had been a member of the Labour Party, but he followed Ramsay MacDonald and supported the creation of the National Government. When a general election was called, Flint was pressed to stand in the Ilkeston division where Labour had a majority of 12,436 at the previous election.\\"New Candidates\\", The Times, 14 October 1931, p. 7. Flint's father was a local supporter of J. H. Thomas, one of the cabinet members who had followed MacDonald and a longstanding MP in Derby. Thomas persuaded Flint, who was not interested in a Parliamentary career, to stand in Ilkeston to relieve the electoral pressure in Derby. According to Thomas' biographer Gregory Blaxland, Thomas assured Flint that there was no chance of his winning,Gregory Blaxland, \\"J. H. Thomas: A Life for Unity\\", Frederick Muller Ltd, London, 1964, p. 258. and Thomas arranged to speak for Flint. The bitterness of the split in Labour showed as Thomas was met with cries of \\"Judas!\\".\\"Mr. Thomas At Ilkeston\\", The Times, 20 October 1931, p. 9. Flint had indeed been chosen to stand without any expectation of victory; Frank Markham wrote to MacDonald's secretary H.B. Usher on 13 October 1931 explaining that it was important to keep the sitting Labour MP in the constituency and stop him \\"speaking in other places where he would do much harm\\".\\"Special note: The making of National Labour\\" in \\"Dictionary of Labour Biography\\" vol XIII ed. by Keith Gildart and David Howell (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), p. 128. Had he not stood, a Conservative Party candidate would have been found to stand.\\"Restraint of Unionists\\", The Times, 16 October 1931, p. 14. After the polls closed it became clear that the Ilkeston election was very close. There were four recounts overnight, and the Returning Officer decided to call a halt in the early hours to return later in the day.\\"The Election\\", The Times, 28 October 1931, p. 12. At the end of the fifth recount, the Returning Officer declared Flint elected by a majority of two votes over the sitting Labour MP. This result remains the joint smallest majority in any individual constituency election since universal suffrage.\\"British Electoral Facts\\" ed. by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, TotalPolitics, 2009, p. 289. Flint's majority was equalled in 2017 by Stephen Gethins. It was also matched in 1997 by Mark Oaten, but his victory was subsequently declared void by an election petition. Parliamentary contributions In the new Parliament, Flint was chosen to make his maiden speech by seconding the 'Loyal Address' at the opening of the first session in 1931. He opened by pointing to the narrowness of his election, saying that any two of his voters could claim responsibility for electing him, and went on to support the economic conference and the interdependence of the Empire.\\"House of Commons\\", The Times, 11 November 1931, p. 7. However, Flint was not an active member after this early start. In February 1933 he joined a delegation of National Labour MPs to the Minister of Health concerning the Government's Housing and Rent Restriction Bills.\\"Labour Committee and Housing\\", The Times, 4 February 1933, p. 10. In April 1934 Flint made a speech in support of the Road Traffic Bill, calling for cyclists to carry compulsory lamps.Hansard, HC 5ser vol 288 cols 205-9.

In November 1957 Flint was elevated to the Judicial Bench as a Judge of Circuit No 18 (Nottingham). During the Second World War, Flint served in the Royal Artillery and rose to the rank of Major. He was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire in August 1970.

Touching upon various matters, it was described as geared towards pragmatic co-operation on issues of common concern. The document was one of the three declarations, adopted by the summit, the other ones being the Declaration by NATO and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on an Enduring Partnership and the Declaration by the Heads of State and Government of the Nations contributing to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Contents The Lisbon Summit Declaration consists of 54 paragraphs. Continuing the 2009 Strasbourg–Kehl summit stance in Georgia–NATO relations, the Declaration called on Russia \\"to reverse its recognition of the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions of Georgia as independent states\\" once again. The Declaration also urged Russia \\"to meet its commitments with respect to Georgia\\" embodied by the 2008 ceasefire agreement following the 2008 South Ossetia war and subsequent treaty of September 8, 2008. Having reaffirmed the 2008 Bucharest summit decision, the Declaration reiterated that \\"Georgia will become a member of NATO\\". The Declaration emphasized further support for territorial integrity of Azerbaijan amid Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and Moldova amid Transnistria issue in particular. It was noted that protracted regional conflicts there continue \\"to be a matter of great concern for the alliance\\". However, because NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen had not supported the idea of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict mediation, the Declaration assumed no legal force in that field. The key provisions of the Declaration envisage continued support for arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation together with the development a missile defence capable to protect all European NATO member states and enhanced computer security. The NATO-led operations and missions are supposed to be embedded with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325. Reaction The Lisbon Summit Declaration is considered advantageous to Azerbaijani diplomacy: at the 1996 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Lisbon summit Armenian delegation vetoed the Article 20 of summit's declaration, which supported Azerbaijan's integrity, prompting the Azerbaijani side to veto the entire document. The deputy executive secretary of New Azerbaijan Party Mubariz Gurbanli characterised the Lisbon Summit Declaration as \\"quite significant\\". The Declaration was denounced in Armenia. Protesting against the reference to territorial integrity in the document, Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan boycotted the summit, leaving Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan and Defense Minister Seyran Ohanian to represent the country. According to Giro Manoyan, a senior member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, the Declaration showed Sargsyan administration's failure to boost Armenia's stance in the West despite rapprochement policy with Turkey.

It can also be written as Kung in Taiwan, Hung in Hong Kong, Khổng in Vietnam, and Gong in Korea. There are around 2.1 million people with this surname in China in 2002, representing 0.23% of the population. In 2018, it was the 97th-most common surname in China. It is the 25th name on the Hundred Family Surnames poem. This surname Kong is most notable as the surname of Confucius and his descendants. The family tree of Confucius and his descendants is generally considered to be the world longest, covering over 2,500 years with more than 80 generations recorded, and has two million entries according to its last update in 2009. The main line of descent traditionally held the title of Duke Yansheng, which was changed to the title of the first Sacrificial Official to Confucius in the 20th century. This title is currently held by Kung Tsui-chang. Kong may also be the English transliteration of a rare Chinese surname 空, or a less common form of the Gong surnames such as 龔, 貢 and 弓. Origin Portrait of Confucius The character for the Kong surname was derived from the Zi (子) family name. The founder of the Shang Dynasty, Tang of Shang whose family name was Zi, had the courtesy name of Taiyi (太乙). His descendants fused the character Zi (子) to Yi (乙), forming the character Kong (孔) which eventually became a surname. It first appeared during the Zhou Dynasty as the courtesy name Kongfu (孔父) of a noble in the State of Song named Jia (嘉), said to be a descendant of the Tang of Shang. Kongfu Jia was murdered, and his son escaped to the State of Lu where he adopted Kong as the name of his clan. His family settled in Qufu and Confucius was one of his descendants. The Kong surname may also have originated from a number of other sources. Others had adopted Kong as their surname because it was part of their ancestors' name. For example, in the State of Zheng, two of Duke Mu of Zheng's (鄭穆公) sons (surname Ji) (姬), had Shikong (士孔) and Zikong (子孔) as their respective courtesy names, and their descendants took Kong as their surname. Similarly, there was a noble in the State of Chen named Kongning (孔宁, originally of surname Gui (妫)), and another in the State of Qi named Konghui (孔虺, originally of surname Jiang (姜)); the descendants of both also adopted the surname Kong. Some of the non-Han Chinese people used Kong as their surname, such as the Derung, Jingpo, Tibetan, and the Yugur people. Various Manchu clans also simplified their surnames to Kong.

Life Frederick Schwartz Lyman (left) with his brothers Henry Munson and David Brainerd Frederick Schwartz Lyman was born July 25, 1837, in Hilo, Hawaii. His middle name is sometimes spelled \\"Swartz\\". His father was David Belden Lyman (1803–1868) and mother was Sarah Joiner Lyman (1805–1885). The couple were early missionaries who founded Hilo Boarding School. His boyhood home is now the Lyman House Memorial Museum. He attended Punahou School (known as Oahu College at the time) from 1850 through 1860. He and schoolmate Samuel Thomas Alexander left briefly to seek their fortunes in California, but soon returned after finding the California Gold Rush had already run its course. In July 1857 he worked as tax assessor for Hawaii Island. He continued working as surveyor and tax assessor during school vacations and after graduation. He was required to record people's ages for the land they owned, but since ancient Hawaii did not use the Christian calendar, he used oral tradition calibrated with a list of major events. One of these was the unusually explosive eruption of Kīlauea known as Keonehelelei, \\"the falling sands\\". Isabella Chambelain Lyman He married Isabella Chamberlain (1838–1901), daughter of Levi Chamberlain, another missionary, on February 16, 1861 and had six children. Isabella's childhood home is now the Mission Houses Museum. They moved to a ranch to raise various livestock such as sheep and goats at Keaīwa in the remote Kaū district to raise a family. Lady Franklin was a guest during her search for her husband, the lost explorer Sir John Franklin. Mark Twain was a guest on his 1866 visit. Lyman became a judge, first a district magistrate in Kaū in 1867. However, a series of disasters struck the otherwise quiet bucolic area in 1868. Letters to his brother David Brainerd Lyman (1840–1914) describe a massive eruption of Mauna Loa on their ranch accompanied by a series of earthquakes from March 27 to March 31. His eyewitness observations, sometimes called the \\"best account\\" of the events, has been used by scientists for many years. A few days later the powerful April 2, 1868 Hawaii earthquake, destroyed their house and most others in the area. A massive landslide triggered by the shock killed much of his livestock. From one of the letters: > \\"It was impossible to stand, we had to sit on the ground, bracing with hands > and feet to keep from rolling over. In the midst of it we saw burst out... > what we supposed to be an immense river of molten lava (which afterwards > proved to be red earth), which rushed down its headlong course and across > the plain below, ... swallowing up everything in its way, trees, houses, > cattle, horses, goats and men. ... After the hard shaking had ceased, all > along the sea-shore the sea was boiling and foaming furiously, all red, for > about an eighth of a mile from the shore, and the shore was covered by the > sea.\\" The resulting tsunami killed many of the witnesses who were living at lower elevations. It was the largest earthquake in modern recorded history of the Hawaiian Islands. This convinced the family to return to town, where he looked for whatever employment he could. After moving back to Hilo, he started a tanning and saddle business, with William Alfred Todd as partner. Lyman became a Circuit judge from 1869 through 1893. He was fluent in the Hawaiian language, and had the Hawaiian nickname \\"Pele\\", a pun based on the volcano goddess Pele and the Hawaiian version of \\"Freddie\\". From 1879 through 1888 he acted as secretary for the Royal Governor of Hawaii Island, first Princess Likelike, and then Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike. Although not directly involved in the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, his fortunes grew as he advocated ties to the United States. He invested in real estate, and various agricultural enterprises around Hilo, experimenting in coffee, cocoa, and arrowroot. Lyman House Memorial Museum In 1894 he was a delegate to the convention to write a constitution for the Republic of Hawaii. He was elected to the Senate of the Republic in 1895, and reelected through 1898. He was president of the Hilo & Hawaii Telephone Company (now part of Hawaiian Telcom), 1882–1885, organizer of the original Hilo Electric Light Company in 1894 (now part of HEI), and its president until 1911. From 1897 to 1918 he ran an insurance business. He worked with William Matson to promote Hawaii as a tourist attraction, leading to the establishment of Matson Navigation Company. He donated land for use in schools, churches, and parks. Isabella died on May 16, 1901, and he died in Hilo on April 14, 1918. Brother Rufus Anderson Lyman also became active in politics and business (they were partners in several ventures). Son Levi Chamberlain Lyman was born December 16, 1866, and served 25 years as principal of the Hilo Boarding School, from 1897–1922. After a fire in 1927 destroyed the original 1856 building, Levi Lyman phased out church control of the school in favor of public schools of the Territory of Hawaii. Other children were teacher Ellen Goodale Lyman (born November 30, 1861), twins pineapple rancher Frederick S. Lyman, Jr. (also known as Frederick Snowden Lyman, born May 7, 1863), and physician Francis Anderson Lyman (May 7, 1863 – October 22, 1917), businessman Ernest Everts Lyman, and Esther Rosalie Lyman (who married William McCluskey).

He wrote crime novels, sometimes using the pseudonyms Michael Stark, Adam Knight and Marston la France. Early career Born in Brooklyn, Lariar studied illustration at the New York School of Fine and Applied Art but then switched to cartooning. After graduation, he teamed with two of his friends, and they started a cartoon agency, selling their own work under a dozen different pseudonyms.Rochelle, Ogden J. \\"How Busy Can Man Get? Editor & Publisher, March 19, 1949. In 1927, they moved the operation to Paris, selling to British magazines and Fleetway. Two years later, they were back in New York looking for work, as Lariar recalled, \\"To make a living, we did everything. We had a service for printers, drew cartoons for calendars, played messenger and did some of the first work for the slicks.\\" They scored with a series of cartoon postcards that Boy Scouts could use to write home, selling more than a million cards in a direct- mail campaign. From 1930 to 1938, working in an office on 45th Street, Lariar did freelance gag cartoons, comic strips and spot drawings, including political cartoons for the New York Journal American and pages for some of the earliest comic books. Liberty In 1941, his Comicard Company in Roosevelt, New York, produced a set of postcards that soldiers could use to write home, similar to Dave Breger's line of Private Breger postcards also available during World War II. Beginning in 1942, Lariar was the cartoon editor of Liberty, where he started The Thropp Family, the first comic strip to run as a continuity in a national magazine. From 1943 to 1946, he was president of the American Society of Magazine Cartoonists. In 1953, he created Yankee Yiddish Cocktail Napkins, which featured cartoons illustrating puns on Yiddish words and expressions. Books During the 1940s, Lariar began writing and published at least 16 books, including Careers in Cartooning (Dodd Mead). His Best Cartoons of the Year series ran from 1942 to 1971, featuring work by Stan Fine and other leading gag cartoonists. In 1961, Lariar interrupted the series to do The Best of Best Cartoons: 20th Anniversary Edition.Christopher Wheeler: \\"Lawrence Lariar\\". Lariar wrote at least nine mystery and crime novels, including four with his character Homer Bull. For Kill-Box (1946), he wrote as Michael Stark, his only novel under that name. Now mostly forgotten, this unusual novel, praised by John W. Campbell, had an Ace paperback edition in 1954 and was published in the UK as Run for Your Life! Anthony Boucher's mention of \\"atomic murder\\" in the cover blurb indicates Lariar's innovative locked room mystery premise: The killer rents an apartment beneath the victim, opens a box with radioactive materials and leaves. After the death of the victim in the overhead apartment, the killer returns and departs with the box.Jaffrey, Sheldon, Double Trouble: A Bibliographic Chronicle of Ace Mystery Doubles. Wildside, 1992. Personal life In 1935, he married his agent, Susan Mayer, one of the first cartoon agents in the magazine gag panel field. They had two children. For over a decade, starting in 1957, Lariar had an affair with Barbara Griffith, the mother of cartoonist Bill Griffith.

Birger Ek was born in 1911 to insurance inspector Arthur Ek and Elsa Lundequist and grew up in Loviisa in southern Finland. He married Tyyni Orvokki Puupponen and had two daughters. He began his military career in the early 1930s. He participated in the Winter War and Continuation War as a pilot and the commander of the second flight of bomber squadron 6 (2./LeLv). He was appointed the Mannerheim Cross (No. 106) and knighthood on 8 February 1943.Finnish Mannerheim Cross Knights He flew 171 wartime missions, including 29 in the Winter War. Captain Ek was the first Finnish \\"Suto\\" (sukellusveneentorjuntalentäjä), or submarine hunter pilot. He is credited with inventing and refining the method of dropping naval depth charges from aircraft. Immediately at the outbreak of the Winter War, Ek noticed that the small bombs used up to that time to combat submersibles were too weak against the Soviet submarines with their strong pressure hulls. They had to find another way of dealing with them. From a friend in the navy he learned about the depth charges that were in use and managed to get a hold of a few for his experiments. He then proceeded to find out at which heights the aircraft should fly to avoid deflecting depth charges from the surface and still drop the charge without breaking the detonation mechanism upon impact with the water. The Finnish bombers were equipped with three depth charges, each one set to detonate at different depths. The bomber squadron became quite successful, sinking eight Soviet submarines. Captain Ek was involved in the sinking of four. The Soviets did not manage to find any effective countermeasures during the entire war. Knowledge of the effective submarine hunting method soon spread around the world. Most navies, up to that point, had been using regular bombs. Upon learning about it, some members of the British House of Commons pressed for the introduction of similar weapons in their aerial submarine hunting forces. This was soon followed by the other Allied forces. British forces mostly used modified Vickers Wellington aircraft equipped with four depth charges and were used quite successfully against Italian and German submarines.Joppe Karhunen: Merilentäjät sodan taivaalla. The most notable difference between the Finnish and Allied methods was that the Allies were able to set the detonation depth just prior the drop, while the Finnish ones were pre-set on ground. This was partly due to the use of less advanced bombers in the naval bombing squadron, and partly due to the shallow depth of the Gulf of Finland where most of the missions were carried out. Captain Ek flew all of his submarine hunting missions with notoriously unreliable Soviet Tupolev SB-2 aircraft that had been captured, usually without escort. The aircraft had to rely on camouflage and also flew at altitudes of only some 100 meters above the sea to make them more difficult to spot, but in the same time made the use of parachutes, as the means of escape, impossible. He was promoted to the rank of Major after the war, and pursued a career as the foreign military attaché at the Finnish embassy in Stockholm and consequently in London. In the 1960s he was taxed at a high level, which he couldn't meet, and decided to go into voluntary exile to the Canary Islands. All his belongings and pension savings were confiscated by the Finnish state, and Ek was forced to loan from friends and relatives to make ends meet.Joppe Karhunen: Erikoismiehet iskevät He returned to Finland just before his death. He is buried at the knight's grove at the Levo cemetery.

She had a long-term relationship with the revolutionary leader Henri Van der Noot and exerted a great deal of political influence upon the rule within the United States of Belgium 1789–1790.  Biography  Jeanne de Bellem was born in poverty but was given a good education. She arrived in Brussels in 1750, where she worked as a domestic and a prostitute and became known for being the mistress of many notables, such as the general governor Ollivier and vicomte de Quenonville, and had a daughter Marianne de Bellem, by an unknown father. In parallel, she had a serious and lifelong relationship with Henri Van der Noot. From 1787, Bellem was a well-known writer of political pamphlets, which encouraged the Belgians to follow the example of America and rise in rebellion toward Austria; she wrote the famous revolutionary poem: \\"Peuple Belgique/cour tyrannique/faisons commet l'Amerique\\". She was also politically active as the intermediary of Van der Noot, who spoke to the Belgian estates and maintained contact with them with her as messenger, as they did not dare to speak to Van der Noot directly. In 1788, during Noot's absence in London, she was arrested for her political activity and put on trial. The trial aroused great attention, but ended with her release after her public apology. She was arrested again in 1789 but was released shortly before the revolution, and gained troops for the rebellion. The 18 December 1789, Jeanne de Bellem participated in the entrance of Henri Van der Noot in Brussels in the carriage by his side and attended the theatre by his side. The involvement of Jeanne de Bellem in the state affairs of the republic was controversial and she was the target of a lot of abusive caricatures by the opposition who used her as a way of criticizing Van der Noot and the government. She was called Noots official mistress, was said to encourage her lovers to attack the democrats in a contra-revolutionary coup, and when Van der Noot took the title of Duke, she was said to long for the title of Duchess. In parallel to the slander, however, she also received a great deal of praise and admiration. It was said that Jeanne de Bellem, Henri Van der Noot and their (male) colleague Eupen lived in a menage-a-trois. Bellem was also in charge of the pamphlets issued by the state. Upon the return of the Austrians and the death of the republic in 1790, Jeanne de Bellem was separated from Van der Noot and fled with her daughter Marianne to Breda in the Netherlands.

Acquired upon the entry of the United States into World War I, the ship served in New England during the war, and was sold back into private ownership in 1921. Service history Ardent was built as a commercial fishing steamer by the Greenport Basin and Construction Company at Greenport on Long Island, New York, in 1902. On 11 June 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased her from Raymond J. Anderson of Newport, Rhode Island, for use as a section patrol boat and minesweeper during World War I. She was commissioned on 15 August 1917 as USS Ardent, with Lieutenant F. P. Betts in command, and was given the hull number SP-680. Following the purchase of the vessel, Ardent was fitted out as a minesweeper for coastal service. Following her conversion, Ardent was assigned to the Mining Force of the 2nd Naval District in southern New England. Ardent conducted patrol and minesweeping duties, and also was used for tending submarine nets in the Newport and Block Island sections for the duration of her World War I service. In 1919, following the end of the war, Ardent was reassigned to Submarine Base New London at Groton, Connecticut. There the ship was used in work on the development of torpedoes for submarine usage, operating in this capacity until 1921. Early in 1921, Ardent was decommissioned, and put up for sale.

After Sajap Kiri was superseded by the short-lived People's Democratic Front, SOBSI joined the new front.Kahin, George McTurnan. Nationalism and Revolution in Indonesia.

The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 153 When the uprising broke out in the town of Madiun, several of the communist SOBSI leaders went underground. Many SOBSI leaders were killed or went into exile when the revolt was subsequently crushed. The SOBSI chairman Harjono and Sarbupri (estate workers union, the largest SOBSI union) chairman Maruto Darusman were imprisoned after the uprising and were killed by the Indonesian army in December 1948, as Dutch troops approached the prison site. SOBSI operations were shut down by the army.Swift, Ann. The road to Madiun: the Indonesian communist uprising of 1948. Cornell Modern Indonesia Project publications, 69. 1989. p. 126 Nineteen out of 34 affiliated unions withdrew from SOBSI in protest against the role played by communist leaders in the rebellion. SOBSI was however not formally outlawed, as the organization as such had not supported the uprising.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. pp. 21, 133 Re-establishment Trade unions temporarily stopped to function during the Dutch attack in December 1948. From May 1948 work began to reorganize SOBSI.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 133 SOBSI was re-established in September 1949. The new leadership was clearly dominated by the Communist Party. The acting chairman of SOBSI, Asrarudin, left the organization in protest against the communist dominance. In November 1949, SOBSI launched a campaign against the Round Table Conference agreement. The organization also called for a Lebaran festival bonus to be instituted. These demands became widely popular, and the organization rapidly expanded its base. By mid-1950 SOBSI had twenty-five vertical unions as well as many local affiliated unions. It claimed a membership of 2.5 million (although that figure was questioned by outsiders). In November 1950 Njono, then 28 years old, returned from a prolonged study trip to China and overtook the leadership of SOBSI as its chairman.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 134 Notably, whilst no longer holding monopoly over the trade union sector, SOBSI was far better organized and financed than its rivals. Moreover, the SOBSI leadership had more experience than that of other unions. Non-SOBSI unions tended to have either a defensive approach towards SOBSI or merely mimicking SOBSI discourse.Feith, Herbert. The Wilopo Cabinet, 1952-1953: A Turning Point in Post-Revolutionary Indonesia. Ithaca, N.Y.: Modern Indonesia Project, Southeast Asia Program, Dept. of Far Eastern Studies, Cornell University, 1958. p. 50 Militant period Between 1950 and early 1952, SOBSI attempted to mobilize militant actions, raising issues such as wages, social security and workplace conditions. SOBSI launched a wave of strikes in late 1950. In September 1950 Sarbupri launched a nationwide strike, which paralyzed most estates. The Sarbupri strike resulted in the first major victory for SOBSI, having forced the government to significantly increase the estate workers' minimum wage. Strikes by oil workers in the same year blocked plans for lay- offs and forces the government to institute a non-contributory pension scheme instead.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 148 In response to the SOBSI strike wave several regional commanders of the army outlawed strikes in essential industries. The policy was by the Natsir cabinet in February 1951. Following the issue of the ban, SOBSI turned to sporadic strikes and sabotage actions (such as destroying cargo at ports or crops at plantations).Trager, Frank N (ed.). Marxism in Southeast Asia; A Study of Four Countries. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, 1959. p. 341 In September 1951 an emergency law substituted the ban on strikes in vital industries, which stipulated mandatory arbitration (which SOBSI initially opposed)Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 49Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 147 In August 1951 around 3,000 SOBSI activists and leaders were imprisoned in a government crackdown on opposition, in the wake of speculations about a possible leftist coup d'état. However, relatively few SOBSI branches and unions mobilized protests against the arrests. National United Front line SOBSI manifestationOn March 1, 1952, the PKI Central Committee adopted a resolution labelling the activities of SOBSI as 'sectarian'. The PKI instructed SOBSI to align with the national united front line of the party; that SOBSI should seek cooperation with non-communist trade unions and mobilize the broadest section of workers. SOBSI held a national conference between September 27 and October 12, 1952, which ratified the shift to the national united front line. The meeting adopted a new constitution for SOBSI, void of any mention of \\"socialism\\", \\"people's democracy\\", \\"class struggle\\" and \\"democratic centralism\\". Under the new orientation SOBSI sought to build alliances with the peasantry and non-comprador bourgeoisie for popular democratic revolution and to mobilize resistance against imperialism.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. pp. 143-144 From this point onwards, SOBSI was cautious of entering into direct conflicts with the government and national capitalists. In direct contradiction to its earlier line, SOBSI even pledged to help national capitalists and to increase productivity in industries. However, the Communist Party eventually intervened against the notion of productivity-increase at its 1956 congress.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. pp. 145-146 SOBSI began forming coordination committees with other unions in different sectors. In 1953 SOBSI, KBKI and four other trade union centres formed a joint May Day committee. From that point onwards, May Day rallies were held jointly.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 150 However, in spite of the more moderate line of SOBSI its affiliated union remained more active in defense of the interests of their members than the rival unions.Mortimer, Rex. Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno: Ideology and Politics, 1959-1965. Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2006. p. 149 In July 1952 the sugar workers union SBG held a major strike demanding Lebaran bonus.Feith, Herbert. The Wilopo Cabinet, 1952-1953: A Turning Point in Post- Revolutionary Indonesia. Ithaca, N.Y.: Modern Indonesia Project, Southeast Asia Program, Dept. of Far Eastern Studies, Cornell University, 1958. p. 107 In September 1953 a Sarbupri strike forced the government to increase wages for estate workers by 30%. SOBSI held its second national congress in January 1955. At this point, the organization had 128 branch offices and claimed a membership of 2,661,970. The congress ratified the new constitution adopted in 1952. During 1955 SOBSI was able to achieve the implementation of some of its long-running demands, such as introduction of Lebaran bonus, new wage scale for workers and employees in the public sector and distribution of cheap essential goods in some enterprises. On March 18, 1957 SOBSI organized a 24-hour general strike in south Sumatra, protest against the local take-over of power by a regional army commander. On the following day, SOBSI issued a warning to Suwirjo that SOBSI would organize a nationwide general strike if he formed a government cabinet with Masjumi and excluding PKI.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 152 Guided Democracy With the introduction of Guided Democracy, President Sukarno increasingly came to rely on SOBSI as the representative of labour.La Botz, Dan. Made in Indonesia: Indonesian Workers Since Suharto. Cambridge, Mass: South End Press, 2001. p. 104 SOBSI was awarded status as a 'functional group' with representation at different levels. When Sukarno appointed a 45-member National Council on July 12, 1957, with the task of assisting the cabinet, SOBSI was awarded one seat (represented by Munir).Lev, Daniel S. The Transition to Guided Democracy: Indonesian Politics, 1957-1959. Jakarta: Equinox Publishing, 2009. p. 42 In July 1957, the SOBSI headquarters were attacked with grenades.Lev, Daniel S. The Transition to Guided Democracy: Indonesian Politics, 1957-1959. Jakarta: Equinox Publishing, 2009. p. 104 In September 1957 a reorganization took place inside SOBSI. The vertical and local unions were reorganized into 31 national unions. The organization had eight regional offices and 150 branches by this point. SOBSI led struggles, both in the streets and inside parliament, demanding nationalizations of Dutch enterprises.La Botz, Dan. Made in Indonesia: Indonesian Workers Since Suharto. Cambridge, Mass: South End Press, 2001. p. 109 When the Indonesian government nationalized Dutch companies in December 1957, SOBSI declared its willingness to keep the companies running. In the wake of the nationalizations, inter-island shipping services were disrupted and thousands of seamen and harbour workers were left unemployed. SOBSI demanded that government pay wages to these groups, a demand conceded to by the government as it accepted to pay wages to the unemployed seamen and harbour workers until mid-1959.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 149 SOBSI representatives were included in the National Council of the National Front (represented by Munir from August 1960), the People's Consultative Assembly and provincial and local councils, appointed by Sukarno in July 1959. Moreover, on August 15, 1959 SOBSI obtained one seat in the National Advisory Council and the National Planning Council.Mortimer, Rex. Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno: Ideology and Politics, 1959-1965. Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2006. p. 101 Some eight SOBSI representatives were included in the appointed parliament formed in June 1960. SOBSI held its third national congress in September–October 1960. In November 1960 the organization had 165 branches and five preparatory branches. At the time the organization claimed a membership of 2,732,909. The SOBSI headquarters had around 50 full-time staff members.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 140 Conflict with the army Eventually, the nationalizations resulted in increased antagonism between SOBSI and the army. In many instances Dutch-owned properties had been seized by SOBSI unions, but were later taken over by the military.Bourchier, David, and Vedi R. Hadiz. Indonesian Politics and Society: A Reader. London: RoutledgeCurzon, 2003. p. 5 Many high-ranking officers were included in the management boards of nationalized companies, and were hostile to the SOBSI influence in the state enterprises.Nyman, Mikaela. Democratising Indonesia: The Challenges of Civil Society in the Era of Reformasi. Copenhagen: NIAS Press, 2006. p. 97 Most of the rivals of SOBSI in the labour movement aligned with the army in challenging SOBSI dominance.Hutchison, Jane, and Andrew Brown. Organising Labour in Globalising Asia. New rich in Asia. London: Routledge, 2001. p. 113 Moreover, an army-backed trade union centre, SOKSI, was formed in 1961, a move SOBSI vehemently protested against.Hefner, Robert W.

Politics and international relations of Southeast Asia. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1978. p. 65 The army and the Minister of Labour had plans of creating a sole trade union federation in the country, as a way of disarming SOBSI. SOBSI was however able to defeat the plan. In response to the attacks on SOBSI by army elements in state enterprises, PKI began denouncing them as 'bureaucratic capitalists'.Mortimer, Rex. Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno: Ideology and Politics, 1959-1965. Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2006. p. 258 SOBSI stepped up its militant opposition against the 'bureaucratic capitalists' in 1960, in response to the abolishing of various colonial-era benefits (such as the Lebaran bonus) in state enterprises.Mortimer, Rex. Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno: Ideology and Politics, 1959-1965. Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2006. p. 257 Three-year plan On January 1, 1961 SOBSI declared an ambitious three- year plan of action on organizing, education and culture. In particular SOBSI sought to strengthen its presence in agricultural and transport sectors. The campaign bore fruit, and the organization claimed to have gained half a million members in two years.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 139 As of late 1962, SOBSI claimed to have 3,277,032 members. In East Java alone, SOBSI claimed a membership exceeding 510,000. During this period 5,278 teachers had been trained to carry out base-level courses, 30,703 SOBSI activists had passed through training courses. During 1962, 19,964 workers completed literacy classes organized by SOBSI. 145 SOBSI sports teams and eleven revolutionary choirs were formed. SOBSI gathered around half of the unionized workers in the country at the time. In December 1963 the United States decided to expand the area of operations of its Seventh Fleet to the Indian Ocean. PKI and SOBSI saw this move as a threat to Indonesia, and SOBSI demanded the nationalization of American companies in Indonesia as a retaliation.Mortimer, Rex. Indonesian Communism Under Sukarno: Ideology and Politics, 1959-1965. Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2006. pp. 243-244 Towards the mid-1960s, SOBSI began to diverge from the party line. The organization became increasingly dissatisfied with the policy of putting national interests ahead of class interests. The PKI leader Aidit condemned these tendencies as 'trade unionism'.Lev, Daniel S., and Ruth McVey. Making Indonesia: [Essays on Modern Indonesia in Honor of George McT. Kahin].

London: Routledge, 2002. p. 38 Prior to the crack-down, U.S.-trained trade unionists had gathered information about SOBSI members and sympathizers. Once the massacres and killings began, these lists were used to identify SOBSI followers. The organization was banned.Warner, Malcolm. Culture and Management in Asia. London: Routledge, 2003. p. 94 With the crushing of SOBSI, decades of tradition of Indonesian radical labour organizing died out. Under the New Order regime, government discourse would continue to argue that independent labour organizing and communism was intimately linked.Clark, Janine Astrid, and Remonda Bensabat-Kleinberg. Economic Liberalization, Democratization and Civil Society in the Developing World. Basingstoke: Macmillan, 2000. p. 34 Relations with the Communist Party Albeit always nominally independent, SOBSI had close links with the Communist Party. Communist Party cadres had worked within SOBSI since the time of its foundation.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 19 Other groups influential inside SOBSI during its first years were the Socialist Party of Amir Sjarifuddin and the Labour Party of Indonesia.Kahin, George McTurnan. Southeast Asia: A Testament. New York: RoutledgeCurzon, 2003. p. 55 By 1951, the Communist Party loosely controlled the national leadership of SOBSI. In response to the PKI influence over SOBSI, non-communist sectors withdrew from the organization and established different trade union organizations of their own.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 135 In March 1952 the Communist Party launched a massive recruitment campaign amongst the SOBSI ranks, and large numbers of SOBSI members became party members.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 137 But the SOBSI leadership was not exclusively communist, the SOBSI leader Ahem Erningpradja was a member of the leadership of the Indonesian Nationalist Party.Feith, Herbert.

The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 66 Likewise, the nine- member central board of SOBSI elected consisted of eight parliamentarians elected on the Communist Party list (six declared Communist Party members whilst the other two were supposedly independents). SOBSI played an active and important role in the electoral campaigns of the Communist Party, both ahead of the two national elections held 1955 and the local elections held 1957–1958. Local level SOBSI electoral action committees were formed throughout the country. SOBSI mobilized workers to participate in PKI election meetings.Hindley, Donald.

Jakarta: Equinox Pub, 2007. p. 202 The main publication of SOBSI was Bendera Buruh ('Workers Flag'). Bendera Buruh had been launched in March 1956, substituting the semi-monthly Buletin SOBSI (which had reached a circulation of 10,000).Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 333 SOBSI also issued an English-language monthly publication called Indonesian Trade Union News. SOBSI publications were, however, largely unprofitable. As of 1957, Bendera Buruh sales only compensated around 40% of its production costs.Hindley, Donald. The Communist Party of Indonesia, 1951-1963. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1964. p. 116 As of May 1957, circulation of Bendera Buruh stood at a meagre 5,500.

OED Online. November 2010. Oxford University Press The records were invariably kept in roll form in the Middle Ages, but in the post-medieval period were more usually entered into volumes. Despite this change of format, the records often continued to be known as court rolls, although the term court books is also found. The rolls record the meetings of the manorial court, either court leet or court baron, or views of frankpledge. Entries usually began with the date; a list of jurors (selected from the manor); and apologies and/or fines for those manorial tenants unable to attend the court. General matters such as a failure to maintain highways or gates are followed by specific items such as the death and inheritance of a tenant since the last court, and any surrenders of land, forfeits, or licences to let. Where land changed hands between customary tenants, a copy of the relevant entry in the court roll constituted the tenant's evidence of title to his holding, and this form of land tenure therefore became known as copyhold.

Opened in 1977, it forms part of the Genoa–Ventimiglia railway, and is situated just over one quarter of the way from Genoa towards Ventimiglia. It is also the western terminus of the Turin–Fossano–Savona railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services to and from the station are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location The station is located in the Mongrifone district of Savona, at Piazza Aldo Moro. History The present Savona railway station was built between 1959 and 1962 by architect Pier Luigi Nervi, to replace the older and more centrally located Savona Letimbro railway station. Its construction anticipated the then future doubling of the Genoa-Ventimiglia railway, which at that time followed a single-track path located mainly near the sea. The new double track line was planned to be further inland. The completed station was officially opened in 1962, in the presence of President Antonio Segni. However, due to major construction delays the new double track line between Savona and Finale Ligure was not completed until 1977. Thus, for fifteen years the new station was a white elephant, used only occasionally by test trains operated to stabilize the embankment. Meanwhile, scheduled passenger trains continued to stop at the nineteenth century Letimbro station. Features In 2009, the passenger building underwent a radical redesign, involving the remodelling of the interior without damage to the existing structures. As at 2010, it had a modern and streamlined appearance, with a new ticket office, a shopping mall and a new entrance facing Piazza Aldo Moro. The station yard has nine tracks and two passing loops. The station is connected by a double-track line with the Savona Parco Doria goods yard, workshops (OMR), a locomotive depot, and Savona Marittima railway station, the latter being situated within the port area. Passenger movements The station has about 6.2 million passenger movements each year.

The most widely known version of the song, however, differs significantly from Magierski's original version, as the song was passed around through word of mouth. The song describes the longing of a soldier in the anti-German partisans who is unable to come see his beloved because he has to hide out in the forest. In the 1960s the song was a basis for a theatrical play directed by Ireneusz Kanicki.

He has been credited with the establishment of a Norwegian-American immigrant settlement in Sugar Creek, Iowa.A Doctrinaire Idealist: Hans Barlien(D. G. Ristad. Volume III: Page 13. The Norwegian- American Historical Association) Personal life Barlien was born in Overhalla, Nord-Trøndelag 29 February 1772 to Anders Sørensen and Ane Hansdatter. On 24 November 1793 he married Kjerstine Einarsdatter Skistad (b. 1768) in Overhalla, daughter of Einar Skistad and Marie Sophie Christensdatter (1808–1897) in Sugar Creek, Iowa. Barlien was grandfather to Norwegian engineer Albert Fenger-Krog (1835–1904) and Norwegian politician Hans Konrad Foosnæs (1846–1917). Early career At the same time as his 1793 marriage, Barlien took over one of the Barli farms of Trondheim Cathedral. The parish priest Hans Blytt (1758–1805), together with Barlien, was the very first to provide vaccinations against smallpox in Norway. Blytt had imported lymph from Copenhagen and vaccinated first his own children, then members of the Barlien family. In May 1804 Hans Barlien moved with his wife and four children to Trondheim, where he bought a pottery located on Prinsens gate. He was later licensed as a watchmaker. Barlien was eager to improve the city's water supply, and initiated a new pump station and glass works on the farm Surviken, working together with Haugeans Otto Carlsen and Paul Anziøn. Barlien received the Dannebrogmændenes Hæderstegn on 28 June 1809 for his technological competence and skill. In 1812 Barlien bought the farm Ågård in Namdalseid for 7000 Norwegian rigsdaler. Political career Barlien entered politics in 1814. He did not become a member of the Constituent Assembly, but was elected as a representative from Nord-Trøndelag during the session 1815–1816 which became his only term in office. He was the only politician with farmer background who was represented in Lagtinget. The regulation of Norway's monetary system was the most important political issue that the Parliament dealt with in the 1815–16 period, and Barlien gave his point of view in a publication named Anmærkninger betræffende Pengevæsenet. En Nationalsag. Barlien wanted to maintain the Eidsvoll Warranty, claiming that \\"each citizen of the state, should, in relation to fortune, participate in the compliance of the Warranty\\". He was not reelected in the 1818 election. His liberal political and religious views had often put him at odds with both the clergy and the establishment. He could not run in 1820 or 1824 because of an ongoing trial against him. In an article in the periodical Det norske Nationalblad, Barlien presented his views on Norwegian constitutional law and his experiences as an MP. In that article, Barlien stated that the Norwegian people were the \\"producing and fabricating part of the state members\\". Immigration and legacy In the year 1837 Hans Barlien emigrated from Norway to the United States. In June 1837 Barlien traveled to the United States aboard the ship Enigheden from Stavanger arriving about the middle of September, 1837. He subsequently visited the Fox River settlement of Norwegian immigrants in La Salle County, Illinois. In 1838 he lived in St. Louis, Missouri and in late 1839 or early 1840, Hans Barlien is attributed with being the founder of the first Norwegian immigrant settlement in the state of Iowa, at Sugar Creek in Lee County. On 31 October 1842 he died in Sugar Creek, Iowa. In 1891, a memorial obelisk in honor of Hans Barlien was erected in Overhalla near Namsos. Hans Barliens gate in Oslo is named for Hans Barlien.

Friedrich der Grosses keel was laid on 26 January 1910 at the AG Vulcan dockyard in Hamburg, her hull was launched on 10 June 1911, and she was commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1912. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of . Friedrich der Grosse was assigned to III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of World War I, and served as fleet flagship from her commissioning until 1917. Along with her four sister ships, , , , and , Friedrich der Grosse participated in all the major fleet operations of World War I, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916. Toward the center of the German line, Friedrich der Grosse was not as heavily engaged as the leading German ships, such as the battleships and and the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group—Friedrich der Grosse emerged from the battle completely unscathed. In 1917, the new battleship replaced Friedrich der Grosse as the fleet flagship. After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Friedrich der Grosse and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the British Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated the final version of the Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Friedrich der Grosse was raised in 1936 and broken up for scrap metal. Her bell was returned to Germany in 1965 and is now located at the Fleet Headquarters in Glücksburg.  Design  alt=A large warship with five gun turrets, two tall masts, two funnels, and heavy armor protection. Friedrich der Grosse was long overall and displaced a maximum of . The ship had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She was powered by three sets of AEG Curtis turbines, supplied with steam by 16 coal-fired boilers. On trials, the powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Friedrich der Grosse was protected by heavy Krupp cemented armor; the main armored belt was thick amidships and the conning tower had thick sides. The gun turrets had sides. As with the other four ships in her class, Friedrich der Grosse carried anti-torpedo nets until after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. The ship was armed with a main battery of ten 30.5 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin turrets. She disposed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a superfiring pair aft. The other two turrets were placed en echelon amidships, such that both could fire on the broadside. The ship was also armed with fourteen SK L/45 guns in casemates amidships, eight SK L/45 guns in casemates; these were removed during the war and replaced with four 8.8 cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. Her armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the ship's hull. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by of KCA on the sides and faces. Friedrich der Grosses conning tower was heavily armored, with sides.  Service history  Ordered under the contract name Ersatz Heimdall as a replacement for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Friedrich der Grosse was laid down at the AG Vulcan dockyard in Hamburg on 26 January 1910. She was launched on 10 June 1911, after which AG Vulcan conducted builder's trials. At her launching ceremony, Princess Alexandra Victoria performed the christening and Field Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz gave a speech. She was then transferred to Wilhelmshaven and commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1912. Exercises in the Baltic Sea followed; Friedrich der Grosse then went to Kiel for final fitting-out work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was finally ready for active service. After her commissioning in January 1913, Friedrich der Grosse conducted sea trials before becoming the fleet flagship on 2 March, replacing . The ship participated in her first round of fleet maneuvers in February 1913, which were conducted in the Kattegat and the North Sea. The next month saw another round of exercises, from 12 to 14 March. The ship went into dock for periodic maintenance in April, and was ready for artillery training by the end of the month. Extensive fleet maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea from 5 to 27 May. Friedrich der Grosse, as the Navy's newest battleship, was sent to Kiel for Kiel Week in June. While there, she was visited by the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III and his wife Elena. In mid-July, the fleet conducted its annual summer cruise to Norway, which lasted until mid-August. During the cruise, Friedrich der Grosse visited Balholmen, Norway. The autumn maneuvers followed after the fleet returned; they lasted from 31 August to 9 September. Unit drills and individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, Friedrich der Grosse participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship again went to Kiel Week that year. Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13 July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.  World War I  The High Seas Fleet, including Friedrich der Grosse, conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2–3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914 was the first such operation. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts—including Friedrich der Grosse and her four sisters—and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. Friedrich der Grosse sometime before 1917 Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet. Admiral von Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915 in which Friedrich der Grosse took part; in the first one on 29–30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of Terschelling and return without incident. Another followed on 17–18 April, where Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of the fleet covered a mining operation by II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21–22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced toward Dogger Bank, though again failed to meet any British forces. II Scouting Group performed another minelaying operation on 17–18 May, and Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of the fleet steamed out in support. Less than two weeks later on 29–30 May, the fleet attempted to conduct a sweep in the North Sea, but inclement weather forced Pohl to cancel the operation some off Schiermonnikoog. The fleet remained in port until 10 August, when it sortied to Helgoland to cover the return of the auxiliary cruiser . A month later, on 11–12 September, the fleet covered another mine- laying operation off the Swarte Bank. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23–24 October, was an advance without result in the direction of Horns Reef. On 11 January 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer replaced von Pohl, who was suffering from liver cancer. A week later on the 18th, Scheer hoisted his flag aboard Friedrich der Grosse. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5–7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the Hoofden. On 25–26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided Tondern, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21–22 April. On 24 April, the battlecruisers of Von Hipper's I Scouting Group conducted a raid on the English coast. Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed but, during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May – 1 June 1916 Soon after the Lowestoft raid, Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, by which time the mine damage to Seydlitz was scheduled to be repaired—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 9 May, several battleships developed problems with their engines, which delayed the operation further, to 23 May. By 22 May, Seydlitz was still not fully repaired and the operation was again postponed, to 29 May. At noon on 29 May, the repairs to Seydlitz were finally completed, and the ship returned to I Scouting Group. The plan called for Hipper's battlecruisers to steam north to the Skagerrak, with the intention of luring out a portion of the British fleet so it could be destroyed by Scheer's waiting battleships. Friedrich der Grosse was the eighth ship in the German line; the four ships of the V Division, III Battle Squadron, led the line, followed by four Kaiser-class ships in the VI Division, III Battle Squadron. Friedrich der Grosse was the last ship in her division, directly astern of and ahead of , the flagship of Vice Admiral Schmidt's I Division, I Battle Squadron. The eight - and s constituted I Squadron, which was followed by the six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve's II Squadron. Hipper's five battlecruisers, the scouting force for the fleet, left the Jade estuary at 02:00 on 31 May; Scheer and the High Seas Fleet followed an hour and a half later. Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, Königs crew spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers and the accompanying fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron; a minute later, he gave the order to open fire. Friedrich der Grosse was still out of range of both the British battlecruisers and the 5th Battle Squadron, and so held her fire initially. Between 17:48 and 17:52, Friedrich der Grosse and ten other battleships engaged the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though only managed to score a hit during this period. Shortly after, the German battle line came across the disabled destroyers and . Friedrich der Grosse and her three sisters targeted Nomad and quickly sank her. Nestor was similarly dispatched by the I Squadron ships. Shortly after 19:00, a melee between the German line and British cruisers took place. The center of the action was the damaged German cruiser , which had been disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser . Rear Admiral Behncke in König attempted to maneuver III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered Wiesbaden with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even the sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled Wiesbaden. While most of the III Squadron battleships rained heavy fire upon the attacking armored cruisers, Friedrich der Grosse and the I Squadron ships engaged the battleship at ranges from , until Warspite disappeared in the haze. In this period, Warspite was hit by 13 heavy shells, though the ships that fired them are unknown. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard Friedrich der Grosse and , the lead ship, caused delays. The series of reversals in course and confused maneuvers disorganized the fleet and inverted the sequence of ships, but by 23:30 the fleet had reached its cruising formation. Friedrich der Grosse was now the ninth ship in a line of twenty-four, headed by the eight I Squadron ships. Shortly after 01:00, the British cruiser Black Prince stumbled into the German line. Searchlights aboard illuminated the target; Friedrich der Grosse, Thüringen, Nassau, and Ostfriesland hammered the cruiser at point-blank range with main and secondary guns. In the span of a few minutes Black Prince exploded and sank, taking her entire crew of 857 with her. After a series of night engagements between the I Squadron battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; five of the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead, and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The rest of the fleet entered Wilhelmshaven, where Friedrich der Grosse and the other ships still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In the course of the battle, Friedrich der Grosse had fired 72 main battery shells and 151 rounds from her secondary guns. She emerged from the battle completely undamaged.  Subsequent North Sea operations  On 18 August 1916, Friedrich der Grosse took part in an operation to bombard Sunderland. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan: the two serviceable German battlecruisers, and , augmented by three faster dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. Scheer, in Friedrich der Grosse, would trail behind with the rest of the fleet and provide support. Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. Another fleet operation took place on 18–19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including Friedrich der Grosse, were transferred to IV Squadron. In March 1917 the new battleship , built to serve as fleet flagship, entered service; on the 17th, Scheer hauled down his flag from Friedrich der Grosse and transferred it to Baden. On 4–5 July, crewmen aboard Friedrich der Grosse staged a hunger strike in protest over the poor quality and insufficient quantity of the food they were given. The ship's officers relented, fed the crew a meal of groat soup and agreed to form a Menagekommission, a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. Further insubordination on several vessels followed on 11 July, and the ringleaders were arrested and put on trial. Max Reichpietsch, a stoker from Friedrich der Grosse was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on 5 September in Cologne.  Operation Albion  alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab (Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of Ösel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula. The Admiralstab issued orders on 18 September for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, and III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of mine warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on Ösel numbered some 14,000 men. The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on Ösel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, Friedrich der Grosse, Kaiserin, and König Albert were detached to support German troops advancing toward Anseküll. The three ships fired on the battery at Zerel for an hour, which prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On 27 October, Friedrich der Grosse was detached from the Baltic and returned to the North Sea. Upon her return, she resumed guard duties. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23–25 April 1918. Afterward, she went into drydock for extensive maintenance, which lasted from 26 July to 28 September.  Fate  Friedrich der Grosse steaming to Scapa Flow for internment click for a larger view|alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Friedrich der Grosse and her four sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the Grossadmiral (Grand Admiral) of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to ensure a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. On the 30th, crewmen aboard Friedrich der Grosse engaged in forms of passive resistance, including a \\"go-slow\\" while replenishing the ship's coal stock. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy.\\" Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to sign the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Friedrich der Grosse capsized and sank at 12:16. In 1936, the ship was raised and broken up for scrap; the work was completed by 29 April 1937. On 30 August 1965, Britain returned the ship's bell to Germany via the frigate ; it now resides at the Fleet Headquarters of the German Navy in Glücksburg.

He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Gill Memorial Prize in 1897. Early life and education Douglas was born on 1 July 1840, in Edinburgh, Scotland, the youngest of six children, to parents Martha Brook and James Douglas. His eldest brother was William Fettes Douglas. His father was an accountant with the Commercial Bank of Scotland. Charlie Douglas was educated at the Royal High School and worked at the accountant's office of the Commercial Bank of Scotland from 1857 to 1862. He emigrated to New Zealand, arriving in Port Chalmers in 1862. For five years, Douglas worked at a variety of jobs, including working on a sheep run, and gold digging. He moved to Ōkārito, Westland, in 1867. Exploration For 40 years Douglas explored and surveyed the West Coast Region of New Zealand. He was described as heavily bearded and with a slight frame, standing about in height. He was accompanied throughout his years of exploration by a dog, first \\"Topsy\\", then \\"Betsey Jane\\" and others. During the colonial period of New Zealand, drowning in rivers was so commonplace before bridges had been built that it became known as the 'New Zealand death'. Douglas could not swim, and he once claimed that this fact \\"had saved his life many a time\\", implying that he would not enter rivers when it was risky. When exploring Douglas carried little in the way of equipment beyond some basic provisions, including tobacco for his beloved pipe, and a swag. He camped beneath his two piece \\"batwing\\" tent of canvas or calico or crude rock shelters. He supplemented his food stocks by hunting native birds and living off the land. Although Douglas lived simply he supported himself by occasional paid work, supplemented by some infrequent provisions sent by his family in Scotland, who also supplied him with some of the books that he read avidly. He worked for a part-time wage from the survey department for 20 years before becoming a full-time employee from 1889. Douglas was a quiet, shy man, who was noted for his keen, accurate and entertaining observations relating to flora, fauna (particularly birds) and geology in his journals, sketches, watercolours and survey reports. Later in his life he grew increasingly intolerant of tourists who were unwilling or unable to endure the hardships he experienced. Douglas condemned the changes to the natural landscape he saw occurring in Westland and he became increasingly embittered as old age and illness began to curtail his later explorations. When he was not exploring he was known to be a heavy drinker. 1868–1888 During this 20-year period, both Gerhard Mueller and George John Roberts attempted to employ Douglas full-time at the survey department, but he instead sent in voluntary reports and maps of the rugged Westland valleys that he tramped and explored and earned a part-time wage while exploring for the department. In 1868, Douglas accompanied Julius von Haast on a month-long expedition travelling down the West Coast, making stops and exploring at: Ōkārito, Bruce Bay, Paringa and Arnott Point before returning to Ōkārito. It is probable that Douglas learned something of geology from Haast at this time because he used Haast's terminology in his later geological notes. During 1874, Douglas met George Roberts and formed a friendship that was to lead to his growing involvement with the New Zealand Survey Department. Also in 1874, Douglas formed a partnership with Bob Ward and the two men bought of land on the Paringa River and began cattle farming. The pair also operated a ferry service across the Paringa. Douglas gave up cattle farming after his partner, Ward, drowned in 1881. After his time as a cattle farmer, Douglas abandoned a settled life and began to tramp and explore Westland, picking up odd-jobs as he needed them. From a base in Jackson Bay starting in the 1870s Douglas continued to explore the: Paringa River (1874–1877), Haast River (1880) and Landsborough River, Blue River (1881), Turnbull River (1882), Okuru River (1882) and associated passes the Actor and Maori (1883), Cascade River with Mueller (1883) and Arawhata River (1883), travelling with Mueller and Roberts on the \\"Reconnaissance Survey\\" from Jackson Bay to Martins Bay (1884). In 1885, Douglas accompanied the chief surveyor, Mueller, exploring the Arawhata River valley. Together, they traced one tributary of the Arawhata, the Williamson River to the Andy Glacier. The other branch, the Waipara River they traced to the Bonar Glacier on the west slope of Mount Aspiring. During this journey they accomplished the summiting of Mount Ionia. In 1886, Douglas and G. T. Murray made a survey trip to the Northern Olivines. During 1887, Douglas and Mueller made a \\"Reconnaissance Survey\\" of the Clarke River and the Landsborough River. In 1887 and later in 1888, Charlie Douglas visited the Balfour Glacier near Mount Tasman and the Fox Glacier. Two immense raptors Douglas claims in his monograph on the birds of South Westland (c. 1899) that he shot and ate two raptors of immense size on the Haast River valley or Landsborough River (possibly during the late 1870s or 1880s): > The expanse of wing of this bird will scarcely be believed. I shot two on > the Haast, one was from tip to tip, the other was , but with all their > expanse of wing they have very little lifting power, as a large hawk can > only lift a duck for a few feet, so no one need get up any of those legends > about birds carrying babies out of cradles, as the eagle is of doing. In light of Douglas' generally trustworthy, detailed observations and measurements as a surveyor, it has been hypothesised by paleozoologist, Trevor H. Worthy, that the dead birds may have represented a biological relict or remnant of the otherwise extinct Haast's eagle. 1889–1903 Charlie Douglas (left), Arthur Paul Harper, and Douglas' dog Betsey Jane in the valley of the Cook River in 1894 From 1889 Douglas agreed to work for the survey department full-time for a wage of eight shillings a day. He was provided with: a prismatic compass, a survey chain and drawing tools. For five months, in 1891 Douglas travelled up the Waiatoto River. He climbed Mount Ragan and reached the Therma Glacier at the head of the Waiatoto. During 1892 Douglas made an important expedition up the Copland River. It was during the Copland trip that he experienced the first real illness of his 52 years. Later in the year he explored the Whitcombe River. Between 1893 and 1895, Douglas was teamed with Arthur Paul Harper and the two first explored the Wanganui River in a dug-out canoe. They then explored the Franz Josef Glacier, Fox Glacier and in 1894 the area of the Cook River. It was in 1894 that rheumatism first began to force Douglas to curtail some of his exploration. In 1896, Douglas returned to the Whitcombe River valley and crossed the Whitcombe Pass to the upper Rakaia. In 1897, Douglas continued track work in the Whitcombe River. It was also in this year that he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society Gill Memorial Prize. He spent the prize money on a camera that he ended up giving away. From 1898 through to 1899, Douglas worked on hut making and track cutting around the glaciers and along the Whitcombe River valley. In 1900, Douglas made his last major expedition along the Wanganui River that included a trip to the Lord Range. In 1901, Douglas explored the Otira River and from 1903 he explored the Okarito district. He increasingly suffered from ill health. Later life: 1904–1916 From 1904 to 1906, Douglas continued to explore and survey for the department but was increasingly restricted by illness and old age. In 1906, while on holiday in Whataroa, Douglas met and was photographed with Richard Seddon, shortly before Seddon's death. Later in 1906 Douglas suffered his first stroke. He continued to explore for the department in 1907 and 1908 but his second stroke forced him to retire from the New Zealand Survey Department after 40 years of almost continual exploration of the West Coast Region. Douglas spent much of his time from 1906 until 1916 being looked after by friends and the widow of his cattle ranching partner, Mrs. Ward. He was also in and out of hospital in 1911, 1914 and 1916. Douglas died, two months short of his 76th birthday, of a cerebral haemorrhage in the Westland Hospital on 23 May 1916, and was buried in Hokitika Cemetery. Known works The following works by Charlie Douglas were published, exhibited or are held and collected: *Contributed to the Appendix to the Journal of the House of Representatives *Exhibited an oil painting at the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition (1889) *Journals and sketchbook are held at the Alexander Turnbull Library *Watercolours and washes are held at the Hocken Collections *Sketches are held at the Westland Museum, Hokitika Awards Charlie Douglas was awarded the 1897 Royal Geographical Society Gill Memorial Prize for \\"persistent explorations during twenty-one years of the difficult region of forests and gorges on the western slopes of the New Zealand Alps\\".

Reception Geronimo debuted on television five days before the theatrical release of Geronimo: An American Legend. Walter Hill, director of the theatrical film, blamed the poor reception of his film on the screening of the TV movie. Hill said, \\"I don't think there are a hell of a lot of movies where you can take basically the same story, show it to 50 million people and bring yours out a week later and think that you're going to do great.

Overview The 351st Strategic Missile Wing was the third United States Air Force LGM-30 Minuteman ICBM wing, the second with the LGM-30B Minuteman I. After the announcement on 14 June 1961, there were second thoughts about the choice as original plans called for launchers to be spread into the Lake of the Ozarks region. Due to the terrain inaccessibility and the high water table, these plans were scrapped. Consequently, when the final approval came on 17 January 1962, the launchers were placed in the vicinity of Whiteman AFB, making this the smallest Minuteman base with regard to area. Activated on 1 February 1963, the 351st Strategic Missile Wing received its first Minuteman IB missile from the Boeing plant at Hill AFB, Utah, on 14 January 1964. Soon the silos assigned to the three operational squadrons of wing were made operational. By 29 June 1964, the last flight of missiles went on alert status, making the 351st a fully operational strategic missile wing. Beginning on 7 May 1966, and throughout the rest of 1966 and into 1967, the Air Force replaced the Minuteman IBs with LGM-30F Minuteman IIs. The completed transition in October 1967 gave the 351st SMW the distinction of being the first wing to complete the Force Modernization Program. The 28 September 1991 order from President Bush to take Minuteman II missiles off alert status ended the 351st's role as an active ICBM wing. Subsequently, the Air Force removed the wing's 150 Minuteman II missiles from service. The wing and its three squadrons of ICBMs were inactivated on 28 July 1995. Under the START I treaty, the missiles were removed and the sites destroyed. The first silo was imploded on 8 December 1993 and the last on 15 December 1997. Today, Whiteman AFB is the home of the 509th Bomb Wing and the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber. One of the retired Minuteman IB is on display. In addition, the Oscar One (O-01) Missile Alert Facility (MAF) is now preserved as a museum. Of the 100 Minuteman LCFs built for the six Minuteman missile wings, this is the only one constructed on the support base itself. Active and retired military personnel with valid identification can tour the facility by contacting the 509th Bomb Wing Public Affairs office. Due to the ongoing \\"War on Terrorism\\", it is closed to the general public. Facilities The Missile Alert Facility (MAF) consists of a buried and hardened Launch Control Facility (LCC) and an above-ground Launch Control Support Building (LCSB). MAFs were formerly known as Launch Control Facilities (LCFs) but terminology was changed in 1992 with the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC). In addition, a MAF has a landing pad for helicopters; a large radio tower; a large \\"top hat\\" HF antenna; a vehicle garage for security vehicles; recreational facilities, and one or two sewage lagoons. The entire site, except for the helicopter pad and sewage lagoons are secured with a fence and security personnel. About a dozen airmen and officers are assigned to a MAF. The underground LCC Launch Control Center (LCC) contains the command and control equipment for missile operations. It is staffed by the two launch officers who have primary control and responsibility for the 10 underground and hardened Launch Facilities (LF)s within its flight which contains the operational missile. Each of the five LCCs also has the ability to command and monitor all 50 LFs within the squadron. The LF is unmanned, except when maintenance and security personnel are needed. A squadron is composed of five flights; flights are denoted by a letter of the alphabet with the facilities controlled by the flight being designated by a number, 01 through 11, with 01 being the MAF.

The first revenue stamps of Bahrain were issued in 1924. Before then Indian revenue stamps were used on documents. Revenue stamps have been used for Land Registry documents, drivers permits and the Dhow Registry. First series (1924-1950) The 4 annas value from the 1924 issue. The first series consisted of seven values from 4 Annas to 100 Rupees and were printed by Waterlow & Sons Ltd in Great Britain. A number of varieties exist including perforate and imperforate stamps, colour trials and bisects. These are very rare genuinely used and most copies that exist are specimens. In about 1950, the 1R value was surcharged 2 RUPEES, and this is the rarest stamp of this series. Later issues (1953- ) The next revenue issue after the first series was issued in 1953. These stamps were similar to contemporary postage stamps but with the word REVENUE added in the design. Four years later, in 1957, the low values of this set were reissued in the new currency (paisa) and in new colours. In 1961 a set of two values was issued, similar to previous designs but with the coat of arms of Bahrain instead of the Sheikh's portrait. This was locally printed, unlike the previous two issues which were printed by De La Rue. In 1961 another set was also issued, and this was reissued in fils and dinars in 1966. A set in a new design was issued between 1971 and 1988, with the portrait of the Sheikh and the coat of arms. Other sets were issued in 1992 and 2014. Stamped papers A variety of revenue stamped papers have been available since 1930. Other issues The 100f and 500f values from the 1966 and 1971 revenue issues also exist with a handstamp in Arabic reading War Tax, and these were used to pay the surtax applied at Bahrain Customs. In 2002, a label was issued to pay the Airport Departure Fee, and a similar one with a revised inscription was issued some time later.

the Chicago Loop. The plan calls for 13,575 new homes, of retail and other commercial space, a new high school, 1,500-slip marina, 125 acres of public land, lakefront access, new bike paths, and commuter rail and bus service would house 150,000 people. The Chicago Lakeside Development Master Plan will take an estimated 25 – 45 years to complete and will cost more than $4 billion in both public and private funds. The project was placed on indefinite hold in February 2016. Project status The South Works site has been vacant since 1992, when Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel closed its plants. September 15, 2010 Chicago Plan Commission approved the project . Chicago Lakeside Development, LLC a joint venture between McCaffery Interests and United States Steel Corporation are developing the development. Phase I of Chicago Lakeside Development includes a mixed-use shopping and residential district known as The Market Common with construction to begin in 2012. The project is estimated to generate more than 1,500 temporary construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs when complete . The Dave Matthews Band Caravan put a space between the past and present in one of Chicago's most unusual concert venues, on July 8, 9 and 10 (2011). The outdoor, no-seating, multistage festival took place on the site of the steel plant. The land cuts like a boomerang into Lake Michigan and has sparkling views of the city skyline about 10 miles to the north. The festival was the first exposure for most concertgoers to the hardscrabble neighborhood and the new Lakeside Development that is slated to include 50,000 residents, stores, a high school and a marina. The event is a public-private partnership among U.S. Steel Corp., Lakeside developer McCaffery Interests of Chicago, festival promoter Starr Hill Presents and, in a rare collaboration, Chicago concert giants Jam Productions and Live Nation. After a press conference at the site, Jam chairman Jerry Mickelson couldn't say what the venue capacity will be, but he did say there will be secured parking for 30,000 cars. There will be no camping; the venue will be temporary. It's said that the concert festival will draw more than 70,000 people a day to this Southside shore location. In February 2016, McCaffrey announced that U.S. Steel had declined to proceed and the project as cancelled, but they would proceed with the project if U.S. Steel was willing to sell the land.

Their repertoire includes medieval drinking songs, old folk tunes and original, medieval- and Renaissance-like compositions. The lyrics of their songs (which include works from authors such as Friedrich Schiller, Heinrich Heine, François Villon and Erich Kaestner) are mostly in German, with some pieces in French and English.

Shortly after, Martin Seifert and Carsten Hickstein joined, while the arrival of Mathew Rouse gave the band its current quintet formation. Among other features, they usually perform at both the Mittelalterlich Phantasie Spectaculum and the Kaltenberger Ritterturnier, where alias are used by all the five members.

A pair of Telegraph stamps overprinted for use as Court Fee stamps in 1870. India has been a heavy user of revenue stamps, both before and after independence. The first revenues were issued in the mid-nineteenth century and they are still being issued to this day. Apart from issues for the whole of India, many princely states, provinces and other states also had or still have their own revenue stamp issues.Barefoot, John. British Commonwealth Revenues. 9th edition. York: J. Barefoot, 2012, pp. 169-211. Before independence Before independence, Indian revenue stamps were closely modelled on similar designs from Great Britain, often using a key type design. Keytypes were used for several types of revenue, including: *Agreement *Broker's Note *Consular *Custodian's Fee *Entertainments (special issues for Bengal, Bombay and the United Provinces) *Foreign Bill *High Court Notarial *Insurance *Notarial *Revenue (Bombay only) *Share Transfer *Small Cause Court (Calcutta only) *Special Adhesive (including overprints for Vakil) Some taxes, however, had special stamps, and these were: *Central Excise *Court Fees (including issues for Copies and Service) *Customs *Foreign Bill *Forest Department *High Court (including issues for Advocate, Attorney and Notarial) *Insurance Agent Licence Fee *Match Tax *Notarial *Petition *Postal Note *Postal Service *Revenue (or Receipt) *Share Transfer *Small Cause Court (including special issues for Calcutta and Madras) *Special Adhesive (including overprints for Vakil) *Tobacco Excise In addition, numerous revenue stamps of unique designs were issued by the Princely States of India.

Most of these stopped having separate revenues as they were dissolved after independence, however some states such as Jaipur and Sikkim continued to do so until the 1960s as they became states of independent India. The state of Jammu and Kashmir still has its own revenue stamps to this day due to its special status in article 370 of the Indian constitution. Some other states which were created after independence such as Assam and Madhya Bharat also issued stamps. Meanwhile, many revenue issues both before and after independence exist with provincial or state overprints. Overprints are known from about 75 different states.Černý, Jiří.

Initially French India stamps were surcharged in Indian currency, and later separate stamps were issued inscribed either Timbre Mobile or Timbre Quittance. Later Pondicherry overprinted Indian revenues with the name of the state, anna stamps were used before and after independence denominations like 2annas,which will be gradually become part of revenue, later denominations like 10rs and 20rs in late '70s profusely but the introduction of these stamps in 1978 and later, higher denominations like 50rs and 100rs were having the highest capability in revenue and duties later and this continued to the 1980. Portuguese India also issued its own revenues. In 1954, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from Portuguese India and it issued a single revenue stamp. After the liberation of Goa in 1961, Portuguese Indian revenues were overprinted with new values in Indian currency for use as Court Fee or Revenue stamps. Later various Indian revenues were overprinted Goa, Daman & Diu for use in the former Portuguese territories. This continued until the 1970s.

The eldest son of Edward Clive of Wormbridge, Herefordshire, and his wife Sarah, daughter of Mr. Key, a Bristol merchant, Clive was born in 1704. He was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 27 March 1719 and called to the bar in 1725. In 1741, he was returned to Parliament for the constituency of St. Michael's, although there is no record of him making any speeches while an MP. In 1745 he was made a Serjeant-at-Law and appointed a Baron of the Exchequer. In January 1753, after the death of Sir Thomas Burnet, Clive was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas, and on 9 February, knighted. He retired in February 1770 with a pension of £1,200 a year, and was succeeded by Sir William Blackstone. Clive died in Bath on 16 April 1771. He was first married to Elizabeth, the daughter of Richard Symons of Mynde Park, Herefordshire, and then to Judith, the youngest daughter of his cousin, the Rev. Benjamin Clive, who died in Wormbridge, Treville, Herefordshire, on 20 August 1796. As he had no children by either marriage, he left the Wormbridge estate to the great-grandson of his eldest uncle, Robert Clive.

Haltadans stone circle, is a stone circle on the island of Fetlar in Shetland, Scotland. This site is a ring of 38 stones, of which 22 are still fixed in the soil, and it is in diameter. Inside this is an earthen ring in diameter, with a gap in the southwest side. In the center of the rings are two rectangular pillars. According to Jakob Jakobsen, the name Haltadans means: \\"lame or limping dance\\". This is a reference to the legend that the circle of stones was once a circle of dancing trolls and that the two rock pillars in the centre were once a fiddler and his wife. They had fiddled and danced all night long, and, heedless of the time, were still fiddling and dancing when the sun rose and petrified them all.

The name Nishikawa means \\"west river\\" in Japanese. There are no extant structures on the site of the castle, though alterations to the topography, such as earthen ramparts and a dry moat, are readily apparent and an explanatory signboard is posted by the trail leading up to the main courtyard. Nishikawa Castle site is located in Ishimaki-Nishikawa-cho, Toyohashi in Aichi Prefecture. Background In 1526, the Mikawa-Saigo family suffered defeat when Yamanaka Castle was stormed by the forces of Matsudaira Kiyoyasu. After four generations of conflict between the Saigo and Matsudaira families, the Saigo were forced to surrender and give up control of northern Mikawa Province; they became loyal vassals of the Matsudaira, their samurai forces ready to fight for their one-time enemy. Although a measure of stability was probably brought to the region, it was still something of a wilderness and at a crossroads for several feuding factions that would be the scene of important battles in the decades to come. A castle in the area would have been an outpost and rallying point to guard against incursions by the Oda, Takeda, or other clans. According to the Mikawa Chorography, a scholarly survey of the region written in 1740, Nishikawa Castle was built to confront the threat of the rival Makino clan, which occupied the adjoining region in what is now the town of Toyokawa. History Nishikawa Castle was built sometime between 1532 and 1555 (the Tenbun Period) by Saigo Kiyokazu, and served as a branch castle of the Saigo clan, while the main residence and clan headquarters was at Wachigaya Castle. As an apparent show of loyalty to the Imagawa clan, the dominant ally of the Matsudaira, the name \\"Nishikawa\\" was created as an amalgamation of the first kanji from Saigo (西, which can be pronounced nishi, sei, or sai) and the second kanji of Imagawa (川, pronounced kawa or gawa). Open conflict between the Saigo and the Makino never occurred. Their mutual allegiance to the Matsudaira clan, their participation in conflicts led by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the pressure of external enemies may have diverted enough resources so that a hostile peace could be maintained. Although Nishikawa Castle was never attacked, it did serve as a forward command position and staging point for Saigo troops on the advent of at least two battles. In 1571, Takeda forces led by Akiyama Nobutomo led an incursion into the area and were driven back by the Saigo, led by Saigo Yoshikatsu and troops from Nishikawa Castle, at the Battle of Takehiro. In 1575, an army under Takeda Katsuyori laid siege to Nagashino Castle in northern Mikawa. An ashigaru soldier named Torii Suneemon crossed the lines of the besieging force to inform Tokugawa Ieyasu at Okazaki Castle. Suneemon would later die for his loyalty and become a popular hero. A legend among the Saigo family asserts that during his mission, Suneemon stopped at Nishikawa Castle for a short rest before pressing on to Okazaki; however, this is not corroborated by other sources. Whether or not the Saigo were informed of the situation in advance, it is known that a combined Oda-Tokugawa army advanced into the area to meet the invading force. Troops of the Saigo clan gathered at Nishikawa Castle and issued forth to join the Tokugawa army for the decisive Battle of Nagashino. Following the Siege of Odawara Castle in 1590, in which Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeated the rival Hōjō clan of the east, Hideyoshi offered the newly acquired Kantō region to Ieyasu in exchange for his five domains, which included Mikawa. Ieyasu accepted the offer, and the Saigo clan accompanied him in his transfer to the east. The lord of Nishikawa Castle, Saigo Iekazu (son of Kiyokazu), was ordered to relocate to Oyumi Castle, in Shimōsa Province (incidentally, the Makino clan was ordered to a province to the northwest in the same year ). Custody of Nishikawa Castle and its surrounding lands was passed from the Saigo to the Ogasawara clan, but with the re-distribution of clans, Mikawa province was surrounded by vassals of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and so Nishikawa Castle ceased to be a priority military structure. In 1661, Ogasawara Naga'aki, who was responsible for administering the region, was promoted to lordship over Yoshida Castle, and Nishikawa Castle was thereafter abandoned. As with many abandoned castles, local peasantry probably plundered the site for building materials such as stones and lumber. Lady Saigo In 1562, Tozuka Masako was born at Nishikawa Castle. Her mother was the elder sister of Saigo Kiyokazu, and in time Saigo would adopt his niece, who spent her childhood at Nishikawa Castle and would eventually become known as Saigō-no-Tsubone (西郷の局) or \\"Lady Saigō\\". Also known affectionately by her nickname Oai (お愛, \\"Love\\"), Lady Saigo was the first consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the most beloved of all his wives and concubines. Lady Saigo would bear two sons by Ieyasu: Tokugawa Hidetada (1579–1632) and Matsudaira Tadayoshi (1580–1607). Hidetada would be the second shōgun of the new Tokugawa bakufu, and led the nation from 1605 until his retirement in 1623. Lady Saigo died on July 1, 1589, at Sunpu Castle, aged 37 years. The cause of her early death was never determined. While murder was suspected at the time, and poison has been theorized as the mode, no culprit was ever identified. Castle design Nishikawa Castle was built on top of a modified natural hill. The top of the hill was levelled for use as the main courtyard (本曲輪 hon-kuruwa) at a height of 20 meters above ground level. Thus, among Japanese castles, Nishikawa is classified as a \\"hill-on-plains castle\\" (平山城). Earthen ramparts were constructed and encircle the courtyard, a dry moat was cut, and a sloping trail around the hill provides access between the courtyard and ground level. The main keep was located on top of the hill and would have overlooked smaller satellite courtyards; one was on a terraced portion of the hill, others were at ground level. The design of Nishikawa Castle therefore conformed with the classic motte-and-bailey design of many European castles, and as it served as the headquarters and residence of a local samurai lord from the Mikawa branch of the Saigo family, Nishikawa Castle met all criteria of an actual castle. Present state The existing site of Nishikawa Castle is mainly composed of the hilltop courtyard where the castle keep once stood. Visitors can park at the Daifuku Temple (大福寺), which is located next to the castle site, or along the shoulder of the road. An explanatory signboard marks the beginning of the sloping grass-covered path which leads around the hill to the top. Features like the dry moat, earthen ramparts, and the earthen foundation for a turret (yagura) are still discernible. Part of the hilltop is covered by a naturally growing stand of Japanese cedar trees, while a cultivated orchard of chestnut trees grows on the rest of the level hilltop. The castle site has also become known to locals for the abundance of dogtooth violets that grow there. The site of Nishikawa Castle is located along Route 499 in the northern countryside of Toyohashi in Aichi Prefecture, near the border with Toyokawa. Daifuku Temple (大福寺) stands next to the castle site, which is marked Shiroyama (城山) or \\"Castle Mountain\\" on some maps.

An oil-paper umbrella (, , ) is a type of paper umbrella that originated in China. It subsequently spread across several East, South and Southeast Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Laos, where it has been further developed with different characteristics. Other than the purpose of providing shade, oil- paper umbrellas are also traditional wedding items. In traditional Chinese and Japanese weddings, the matron of honor would cover the bride with a red oil- paper umbrella upon arrival to ward off evil spirits. Purple umbrellas are a symbol of longevity for elders, while white umbrellas are used in funerals. Oil-paper umbrellas are also used as props in Japanese traditional dances and tea ceremonies. In the early Hakka society, two umbrellas were usually given as dowry, due to the \\"paper\\" (纸) and \\"child\\" (子) homonym in the language (Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: chṳ́), symbolizing a blessing for the woman to \\"give birth to a son soon\\", a propitiatory compliment to the newlyweds at the time. Also, as the character \\"umbrella\\" contains five ”people\\", gifting the umbrellas represents a blessing for the couple to have many sons and grandsons. In addition, because of the \\"oil\\" and \\"have\\" homonym, and that the umbrellas open into a round shape, they symbolize a happy, complete life. It was also customary to give an umbrella to a 16-year-old man at his rite of passage. In religious celebrations, oil-paper umbrellas are often seen on the sacred sedan chairs as cover, used to shelter people from rain and sunlight, also to drive the evil spirits away. Today, oil-paper umbrellas are mostly sold as works of art or souvenirs. History Oil-paper umbrella in the Legend of the White Snake The spread of oil-paper umbrellas was started by the invention of Yun (), wife of Luban (). \\"Chop bamboo sticks to thin strips, covered in animal fur, closed to become a cane, opened as a cone.\\" But early umbrella materials were mostly feathers or silks, later replaced by paper. When oil-paper umbrellas first appeared is unknown. Some estimate that they spread across to Korea and Japan during the Tang dynasty. It was commonly called the \\"green oil-paper umbrella\\" during the Song dynasty. The popularity grew and the oil- paper umbrella became commonplace during the Ming dynasty. They are often mentioned in popular Chinese literature. By the 19th century, oil-paper umbrellas were a common item in international trade under the name kittisols. Basic production process The production process and required procedures are different in each region. However, in general, they can be divided into four main steps: # Bamboo is selected # The bamboo is crafted and soaked in water. It is then dried in the sun, drilled, threaded and assembled into a skeleton. # Washi paper is cut and glued onto the skeleton. It is trimmed, oiled, and exposed to sunlight. # Lastly, patterns are painted onto the umbrella. Oil-paper umbrellas in mainland China The art of the Chinese style of oil-paper umbrellas are mostly focused on traditional black and white Chinese painting such as flowers, birds, and scenery. Others include scenes from famous Chinese literature, such as Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the Western Chamber. Yet, some have Chinese calligraphy instead of paintings. However, traditional colors are kept on the sticks and the scaffold of the umbrella to maintain the antiquity. Yuhang, Zhejiang In Yuhang District, Zhejiang, oil-paper umbrellas have been produced since the era of the Qianlong Emperor (1769), by Dong Wenyuan (), who owned an umbrella shop. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are made with high mechanical skills and top materials, which provide their endurance. Prolonged exposure to sunlight and rain does no damage, thus their popularity among common people. Many travelers who passed through Yuan would buy umbrellas from Dong Wenyuan's umbrella shop as souvenirs for friends and relatives. Oil-paper umbrellas in Yuhang are available in a variety of different types and purposes, including those used for fishing or as collectibles. In 1951, Zhejiang province has chosen Yuhang as the focused point of the industrial artifact for oil-paper umbrellas and initiated a group for this establishment in 1952. The later established \\"Artifact Rain Umbrella Industry Co-operations\\" () was the first industry of artifacts in Zhejiang province. This establishment was once in the spotlight of the Chinese media, however, as the popular metallic umbrella appeared on the market and oil-paper umbrellas have faced extinction. On December 5, 2006, artisan Liu Youquan () met a government official of the Yuhang district and proposed to recover the oil-paper umbrella in Yuhan, with the intention of starting a new pop culture trend and increase local wealth. Liu spent a few hundred RMB and bought some dozens of the bamboo umbrella from a bamboo umbrella factory. But Liu did not have the skills, only to keep these as a \\"canvas\\" for 30 some years. A local media reported for a search of an oil- paper umbrella artisan and increased local awareness. Four days later, four artisans: Fang Jinquan (), Chen Yue Xiang (), Shen Lihua (), and Sun Shuigen () prompted and have intentions to recover the art (drawing oil paintings on the bamboo umbrella). They have passed their skills and technique to some local bamboo farmers and brought income to them. The governmental officials of Yuhang have listed this art for major protection and important antique artifact (Antiquities Act). Production requires skilled hands and technique as well as personal experience. Training to become a master in oil-paper umbrella manufacture requires an apprenticeship and a great deal of practice. Apprentices must practice the skills for three years to officially master this technique. Tools are made by professional blacksmiths. The material of the umbrellas is chosen with care. The umbrella scaffold is made from either bamboo or wood, tied with hair strings. The best umbrellas are made from peach flowers, as the umbrella surface is soaked in persimmon pigment. The persimmon pigment is made from fermenting the juice of green persimmons, which provides a suitable stickiness. The soaked flower petals are stuck to the umbrella scaffold one by one. Paintings or pictures are drawn on the peach flower petals prior to painting tung oil on top. The finalized umbrella is left to dry in a dry dark room. It requires at least 70 steps to produce a well- crafted oil-paper umbrella. Sichuan In Luzhou, Sichuan, the oil-paper umbrella culture started around the end of Ming dynasty and beginning of Qing dynasty. Oil-paper umbrellas have existed in Sichuan for as long as four hundred years. Herem, the umbrellas are exquisite with fine paintings, abundant colors and beautiful outlooks, the umbrellas are also famous for their ability to shield strong winds. In 1993 May, six experienced artisans have spent four months to produce a famous Erlongxizhu umbrella (), which was exported to countries such as England, Malaysia and Singapore. The Erlongxizhu was made out of 88 pinaceae and 52 bamboo sticks with 1800 skin paper and 100 kilograms of oil pigment. Producing the Erlongxizhu required over 70 procedures and it was regarded as the \\"Chinese King of Umbrellas\\". After Western umbrellas had increased in popularity, the Luzhou oil-paper umbrella's popularity diminished dramatically. In addition, due to the sophisticated procedures, the high production cost and low profit, not many young men were willing to commit to this art. In 2004, only about thirty experienced artisans were willing to continue this umbrella production. Many people worried that the skills may soon become extinct. In October 2005, an exhibition in Shanghai invited the local government to an exhibition of oil-paper umbrellas, and they have recovered some popularity since then. After the recovery, Yunnan and Luzho minorities gained awareness of oil-paper umbrellas and used them during ceremonies and gifts. Since then, the umbrellas have been exported to Japan, Singapore, Korea, Hong Kong and Macau. Contemporary local artisans still utilize the traditional method of oil-paper umbrella production, which includes the 70 or so procedures of total manual production. Such as slicing the bamboo and painting the pictures. Materials used are also orthodox to the traditional materials, such as the bamboo sticks directly brought from the mountains where they were chopped. Tools of production are old too. Such as the black stone ink is already 450 years old. Quality control is strict; the four trenches should not meet and the tung oil must be spread evenly across the umbrella surface. The paintings adhere to the situations they are used for. Jiangxi Oil-paper umbrellas in the Wuyuan County of the Jiangxi province are orthodox and beautiful in appearance, as well as endurable with portability, named the \\"\\". During the Song dynasty, a local resident of Jiangxi named \\"\\" was awarded the position chancellor, who then brought an oil- paper umbrella back to Jiangxi with him from a major city. One named \\"\\" have improved upon the prototype and passed it on to his descendants. It was said that during the Ching dynasty when the Kangxi Emperor was on the throne, one day the Kangxi Emperor secretly traveled to Wuyuan and it was raining. Kangxi Emperor saw a kid who threw a stone at the umbrella, however, the stone bounced back off from the umbrella without damaging it. Kangxi Emperor was surprised by the quality and strength of the oil-paper umbrella and gave it a positive name called the \\"Jialu paper umbrella Jia Tianxia\\" (). Since then they have been commonly called \\"Jialu umbrellas\\" (). Jialu umbrellas were awarded the first place during an international exhibition in 1936 and reached its peak at 1943, which recorded to have once produced 25,000 umbrellas and exported 17,000 annually. In 2000, however, only three eighty-year-old artisans have possessed the skill, in addition, one of the raw materials, persimmon tree is in extinction. Jialu umbrellas have since become extinct. In 2006, the locals have produced a new and natural breed and increased the quality of Jialu umbrellas. Jialu umbrella production reached 50,000 annually and exported to countries such as the United States, Japan, and Korea. Contemporarily, there are four factories located in Wuyuan with a net worth of eight million RMB, thirty villagers and 1,800 workers. Jialu umbrellas are made from high-quality bamboo, skin paper, and tung oil. The main procedures are slicing the umbrella scaffold, cutting the umbrella portion, installing the umbrella sticks, boiling the umbrella stick, adding the skin paper, painting on the skin paper, editing the umbrella skin, brushing on tung oil, stitching the umbrella with decorations, installing the handle and the head.

Oil- paper umbrella in Taiwan Oil-paper umbrella has been the cultural symbol of the Hakka in Meinong District of Kaohsiung. The production procedures are divided into five major portions. This includes the umbrella scaffold, umbrella production, umbrella head, umbrella handle and art painting. With any one of the above been done, the umbrella could be called as a \\"full art\\" (). History and modifications Oil-paper umbrella production in Meinong initiation has two rumors. *One was that it started during the Japanese rule, during which, Lin () and Wu () invited oil-paper umbrella artisans from mainland China to Taiwan for the purpose of passing the skills to the locals. *The other was that oil-paper umbrella artisan Guo () have arrived in Taiwan from Guangdong province. Since then, he had permanently stayed in the Meinong district and spread the skills locally. Early Meinong oil-paper umbrella factor was called \\"\\" (pronounced \\"Young\\") for connotations of wealth, wide and progression. In 1960, oil-paper umbrella, tobacco leaves, and rice were Meinong district's major income sources. At that time, it was the renaissance of oil-paper umbrella. It was estimated that there were at least twenty factories producing twenty thousand oil-paper umbrellas annually. However, with the rapid industrialization in Taiwan, mechanically produced Western umbrellas have replaced them in attribute to low cost, longevity, and portability. Taiwan has become the key country of Western umbrella production and forced many traditional handmade oil-paper umbrella factories out of business. In 1970, an English journal used the Goung () oil-paper umbrella pioneer, Lin () and his umbrella as the magazine cover, along with a detailed article on the culture and production of oil-paper umbrella. BBC have also included a series of recording of the oil-paper umbrella called the \\"Long Search\\". In addition, 1983, famous Hakka movie producer, Lin Fu-De (), have incorporated the oil-paper umbrella into his drama, Star Knows My Heart. When the drama was played in the Japanese television, Taiwanese oil-paper umbrella gained impression in the Japanese, who have ordered a large quantity for imports. After 1980, with the increase of Taiwan overall financial status, Meinong's increased tourism, oil-paper umbrella have recovered its utility in the daily life along with its value as a local culture and travel souvenir. Production and materials Meinong oil-paper umbrella scaffolds are made mainly from bamboo sticks, which are translocated from places such as Puli, Zhushan, Nantou County and the Cishan District of Kaohsiung. Especially the famous moso bamboo of the Qushan district. Moso bamboo is famous for its strength and elasticity. Thus the scaffold is mainly made of moso bamboo. Prior to production, most bamboo is soaked in water to eliminate the sugar for a month. Then they are dried under the sun to prevent infection of bugs. After cutting and slicing, they become the fundamental scaffold of the umbrella, with additional modifications such as umbrella head, handle and hole drilling for stitching.

The handle and scaffold are often colored black, however, sometimes other colors are applied as well. The surface paintings include traditional Japanese culture, gained popularity from the Azuchi–Momoyama period to Edo period. History The underside of a Japanese oil-paper umbrella The origin of oil-paper umbrellas could be traced to those fabric canopies brought from Korea to Japan during the Asuka period, which samples are preserved among the Shōsōin treasures. Initially, the oil-paper umbrella was a sacred instrument in Buddhist ceremony. During the Heian period, techniques in paper production and bamboo work advanced. In the Muromachi period, pigments and wax were applied to the surface of the paper for additional resistance to water. Oil-paper umbrella used in weddings in Ryūkyū During the Azuchi-Momoyama period, Luzon Sukezaemon introduced an umbrella with a shield from the Philippines, which contributed the popularity of the wages. During the Genroku era, modifications were made to enhance its utility to specific circumstances. Some monks and doctors used shorter and thicker umbrellas with business trademarks or logos on them, then lent them to customers as an advertisement. Umbrellas also became the geisha's tool as well. In addition, some unemployed Edo period samurai crafted oil-paper umbrellas as a secondary occupation. A famous example is the , made in Nagano Prefecture, which is still made there. However, with the popularity of Western umbrellas in the Meiji period, oil-paper umbrellas have diminished markets today, with only a few locations producing it, such as Kyoto, Gifu Prefecture and Yodoe, Tottori Prefecture. Tsujikura is the oldest shop of the oil-paper umbrella in Japan. Kyoto Kyō wagasa, a traditional umbrella of Kyoto, Japan. A style of oil-paper umbrella in Kyoto is called .

One umbrella style has concentric circles on the exterior side of the umbrella skin called the , which literally means eye of a snake. Gifu Oil-paper umbrella production in Gifu started around 1750. Every oil-paper umbrella made in Gifu goes through over a hundred procedures. During the Shōwa period, the production in Gifu reached its peak at about fifteen million annually. Today, the production is only about a few tens of thousands per year. Yodoe Oil-paper umbrella production started in Yodoe, Tottori in 1821, by the . During the Meiji period, the production in Yodoe was only about a few thousand annually. However, due to the abundance and accessibility of bamboo and other raw materials, during the Taishō period, production by factories increased 71% and a net production of 17,000 Wagasa annually. Most areas in western Japan regularly used the Yodoe Wagasa. Wagasa in Japanese culture Wagasa at a wedding ceremony Other than its utility, oil-paper umbrellas appear quite often in Japanese culture, and are often associated with geisha, traditional dance, tea ceremony, and daily utility including wedding ceremony.

One time as he approached near the Northern border of Burma and stayed there for a few days, the Thai people there accommodated him while his stay.

The monk thought the umbrella was very convenient and was curious for how it was made, he decided to learn to make the umbrella. Thus he visited the village that was specialized in the production of umbrella located in Burma. Pra In that recorded the detailed production procedures and brought it with him back to Wat Bo Sang temple. After arriving back at Wat Bo Sang, Pra In that was on a hunt for the needed materials to produce the umbrella, with some assistance of the villagers, they were able to make the first umbrella in Thailand. Initially, not many villagers were motivated to make umbrellas, however, once they found the convenience of it, many were attracted to mass-produce and buying it. Oil-paper umbrella production became one of the major sources of income for the Bo Sang village. In 1941, Bo Sang villagers have cooperated and established the \\"Bo Sang Umbrella Making Cooperative Ltd.\\". The chief of the company is Jamroon Suthiwiwat.

Grady finds and convinces his parents to let him keep a large wolf-like stray dog for a pet which he names Wolf. But when something has broken into the deer pen in Grady's yard and killed one of the animals, his dad decides that the stray had to be taken to the pound. Grady helps the dog flee before his dad can capture it. That night, Grady hears the howling again and explores Fever Swamp to get to the bottom of things. He encounters Will Blake, one of his friends, who is slowly turning into a werewolf under the full moon. The newly changed werewolf bites Grady, but the assault is cut short when Wolf attacks and kills Will. On the night of the next full moon, Grady transforms into a werewolf and joins Wolf in hunting. The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight Youngsters Mark and Jodie are brother and sister. While visiting their grandparents, Curtis and Miriam, the children notice strange movements at night: the scarecrows are moving, and their grandparents are acting differently. Jodie concludes that Sticks, the groundskeeper Stanley's son, made the scarecrows move. Jodie dresses Mark up as a scarecrow for revenge on Sticks. However, after a scarecrow tries to hurt Jodie, Sticks explains to her that Stanley brought the scarecrows to life last time he visited the farm. Curtis and Miriam had been trying to keep Stanley happy so that he will keep the scarecrows asleep. After scaring Stanley with the scarecrow costume, the scarecrows begin walking towards them. Sticks uses torches to burn all the scarecrows, and they all fall to the ground. The next afternoon, Jodie notices a stuffed bear move a little. This comic has a significant use of figurative language. For example, one instance is when Jodie hugs her grandpa and he asks if she got her hair from a store. She replies with, \\"You're right, Grandpa. It's a wig.\\" The author uses verbal irony to exemplify how close the two are with their humor. The author also uses ambiguity with the word choice to create tension. Stanley states, \\"The corn has ears.\\" This statement is both true literally, but it also brings suspense to the story with a suggestion that there is something supernatural in the field. Onomatopoeia is used with the repeated word \\"scrape\\" to bring a more heightened sense of fear and intensity during the nightmare scene. The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena Ana and Luis Garcia decide to join their father on a trip to Alaska to try to locate a snow creature known as the Abominable Snowman. There, they eventually see the Snowman frozen in ice. Their father decides to take him back to Pasadena, California, where they live. Before doing so, Luis sneaks some snowballs in the trunk in which the Snowman would be taken home. After showing their neighbor Lauren Sax the Snowman, Ana throws a snowball from the trunk at her, but it misses and hits the tree. This causes the snow to expand and covers their yard in snow. Lauren grabs some of the snow and throws it at Ana, and she becomes covered in ice. After the heat from the furnace and oven does not defrost her, Luis gets the Snowman to break out of the ice.

It is a reboot of the series. First revealed at the Spike Video Game Awards in 2010 under the working title SSX: Deadly Descents, the game's trailer appeared to show a much darker direction to the series than previous entries, though later footage revealed a return to a lighter tone. SSX includes the use of real locations, rather than the fictional courses of past games. The game was developed by EA Canada and released in North America on February 28, 2012, and was later released worldwide in March 2012 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics who praised the motivation behind its development. SSX was a commercial success for Electronic Arts. Gameplay SSX is a snowboarding game which can be controlled via buttons or analogue sticks, although an option for classic controls from earlier entries in the series is available. Throughout the game, players will navigate various snowy levels and performing massive tricks. Players can perform various tricks which earns them boost they can use to travel faster. By filling up the boost meter completely, players enter 'Tricky' mode, which makes a return from SSX Tricky. During this mode, players have unlimited boost and tricks will now become wilder 'Über' tricks. If players perform enough Über tricks whilst in Tricky mode, they will enter 'Super Tricky' mode, allowing for wilder Über tricks and prolonged unlimited boost, which can last longer if the player continuously performs tricks. As players perform tricks, they build up a combo bonus which goes through a multiplier once cashed in, although will be lost if the player bails. If the player makes a mistake, s/he can rewind time to get back on track, although this will cost trick points and opponents and time will continue to run normally. The main bulk of the game is the World Tour mode, in which Team SSX attempt to conquer the nine deadly descents across the world, including the Himalayas and Antarctica. During each location, players will train a specific rider to tackle the descent via a series of events which generally involve either defeating opponents in a race or obtaining the highest trick score. These culminate in a Deadly Descent stage in which the player is tasked with safely making it to the end of the level with a limited number of rewinds. Each of these descents features a dangerous obstacle, such as trees, avalanches, large drops, low oxygen, freezing areas and darkness. To face up against these threats, the player can equip various gadgets designed to help them. These include body armor to defend against rocks and trees, wingsuits to clear large gaps, pickaxes to aid turning on icy surfaces and flashlights to light up dark areas. Playing through this mode unlocks new areas and characters for use in other modes. Other modes include Explore Mode, in which players can freely explore the various mountains and take on various challenges, and Global Events, in which players can take on various challenge online, although certain features will require an online pass, either sold with new copies of the game or purchased online. Performing well in any of the modes earns the players SSX Credits which can be used to purchase new boards or gadget upgrades. Players are also able to plant Geotags throughout the various levels, challenging players to try and reach them in order to earn some extra credits. Characters Original SSX character Elise Riggs was the first to be revealed, on May 27, 2011 via a comic strip along with a short gameplay video. Mackenzie \\"Mac\\" Fraser, Kaori Nishidake, Moby Jones, Psymon Stark, Zoe Payne, Griff Simmons and Eddie Wachowski (pre-order bonus from GameStop) also appear in the game. New characters include Tane Mumea, Alex Moreau, and Ty Thorsen. EGM. Retrieved January 24, 2011. On November 8, it was announced on Conan that Travis Rice would be a playable character in the game. On May 27, 2011, EA Sports released a comic strip on the character Elise, and has continued to release more comics on returning characters based on time or the amount of likes the EA Sports SSX page earns on social networking website Facebook. Plot The World Tour follows biker Zoe Payne who, along with snowboarder Mac Fraser and surfer Tane Mumea, has founded Team SSX (which stands for Snowboarding, Surfing, and Motocross in this game). Gathering a team of nine of the best riders in the world, Team SSX plans to conquer the nine deadliest descents across the world in order to raise funds via livestreaming. However, a former SSX member, Griff Simmons, is seeking to conquer the nine descents himself, leading to a race against time to see who will conquer the world first. Soundtrack The soundtrack features a large amount of tracks spanning different genres.

The dynasty, originally based in Nagold, managed to acquire extensive holdings over the course of their time in power, distinguishing themselves by founding a large number monasteries in their territories. By the time of the High Middle Ages, several factors contributed to their economic decline, including the expenses of keeping court and extravagant donations to the monasteries they founded. The line itself experienced fragmentation into numerous cadet branches, the longest-lasting of which were the Counts of Tübingen-Lichteck (until 1664) and the Counts of Montfort (1787).  History  The oldest documented count of Nagold is Anselm of Nagoldgau the Elder, who is as recorded as possessing Kuppingen (modern Herrenberg-Kuppingen) in the year 966. He is followed by Anselm of Nagoldgau the Younger, who is mentioned in records from 1027 and 1048. Between these two (the only two counts designated \\"of Nagoldgau\\") a certain Count Hugo I of Nagold, presumably from the same family, appears in 1007, when he was invested with the royal estates of Holzgerlingen and the Imperial forest at Schönbuch. The city of Tübingen first appears in official records in 1191, and the local castle, Hohentübingen, has records going back to 1078 (as \\"castrum Twingia\\") when it was besieged by Henry IV, King of Germany in the context of the Investiture Controversy. Hugo III (who also founded Blaubeuren Abbey in 1066) would nevertheless submit to the king the following year. Castle Hohentübingen, 1875 From 1146, Hugo V (1125-1152) would bear the title of count palatine (Pfalzgraf), as Hugo I of Tübingen. This promotion is presumably due to services rendered to Conrad III, the first Hohenstaufen king of Germany, elected in 1138. By that point, the office of count palatine was no longer tied to its original task of maintaining a royal palace (whence the term “palatine”), but instead indicated that the holder exercised a certain degree of power and authority as the king's official representative within a stem duchy, making Hugo second only to the Duke of Swabia. As count palatine, he was also granted the right to exercise judicial powers in the king's stead, in addition to hunting rights, the right to collect customs, and the right to mint coins – as demonstrated by the Tübingen pfennig, which appears starting in 1185. Hugo II (1153–82) gained Bregenz and other property in Raetia Curiensis, Tettnang and Sigmaringen by marriage to Elizabeth of Bregenz. In 1171, Hugo II founded Marchtal Abbey, and his first son Rudolph I would go on to found Bebenhausen Abbey in 1183. Rudolph also acquired Gießen via marriage to Matilda, countess of Gleiburg, which would later be sold to the landgraves of Hesse in 1264. Hugo's second son founded the Montfort dynasty, as Hugo I, Count of Montfort (d. 1230). Upon the death of Rudolph I, his and Matilda's eldest son Rudolph II (1224-1247) became ruler of Horb, Herrenberg, and Tübingen. Their second son William would go on to found the Asberg-Gießen- Böblingen line. Rudolph II's son, originally Rudolph III of Tübingen, started what would be known as the Herrenberg Line, as Rudolph I of Scheer (d. 1277).  Decline  By the early 1300s, Count Palatine Gottfried I (\\"Götz\\") was deeply in debt to Bebenhausen Abbey. He signed over extensive rights to the abbey, even transferring control of Böblingen and Calw. In 1311, Henry VII placed the imperial ban on Count Eberhard I of Württemberg, and Gottfried was appointed Feldhauptmann in the imperial army, defeating Eberhard in May of that year. In a show of gratitude, the city of Esslingen assumed Gottfried's debts to the abbey, and he was able to recover the two towns. Before long, however, his sons and his grandson Gottfried III would find themselves so deep in debt that they would enter into another debt-relief agreement, this time with the city of Tübingen, with Ulrich III, Count of Württemberg (Eberhard's son) acting as guarantor. For a nine-year period, the city would enjoy a wide range of privileges, including the right to elect their own Amtmänner (bailiffs) and to determine how their tax revenues were to be distributed. But in 1342, Gottfried found himself in conflict with Ulrich. Ordered by Emperor Louis the Bavarian to make full restitution, he was forced to sell Tübingen to Ulrich for 20,000 gold hellers. Throughout the Middle Ages, the individual branches of the dynasty died out one after another: Horb by 1293, Asberg after 1357, Böblingen by 1377, with Herrenberg lasting until 1677. The last male member of the family to bear the name was Johann Georg, illegitimate son of Conrad William of Tübingen-Lichteneck. He served the duke of Württemberg in the Thirty Years' War as commander of the defenses at Hohentübingen Castle.Paulus, Karl Eduard (1867) Beschreibung des Oberamts Tübingen In 1677, he died with no male heirs. After the county palatine was sold to the County of Württemberg (or donated to Bebenhausen Abbey), it has since been part of the Duchy of Württemberg (1495–1806), the Kingdom of Württemberg (1806–1918), the Free People's State of Württemberg (1918–1945) and Baden-Württemberg (since 1952).  Coat of Arms  The arms of the Counts Palatine of Tübingen always consist of the same basic design, but in different color combinations, representing the various branches of the family. The original coat of arms consists of a red three-tailed banner (gonfanon) with gold rings and fringes on a gold shield. Zürich Armorial The counts of Montfort adopted the red banner from the original arms, but placed them on a silver shield instead of a gold one. This version is used as the arms of the Austrian state of Voralberg, and also appears as an escutcheon on the state flag. The counts of Werdenberg, who split off from the Montfort line, used a black banner on silver, while Werdenberg-Vaduz used a silver banner on black, and Werdenberg-Sargans a silver banner on red. The latter are featured in the arms of House Fürstenberg, having been acquired by the counts of Fürstenberg after the extinction of the Werdenberg-Sargans-Trochtelfingen line. The arms of the County Palatine of Tübingen – or its cadet branches – have been displayed in the arms of several locations throughout the region, including Tübingen, Herrenberg, Böblingen, and Horb. While Horb later adopted the Hohenberg arms, the other towns have retained them to this day. Herrenberg reversed the colors, with a gold banner on a red shield. As for Tübingen, a pair of crossed arms holding antlers were added above the shield by Duke Ulrich of Württemberg in 1514.  Genealogy  Note: The following lists have been simplified.

Most neurons of the nucleus basalis are rich in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and they have widespread projections to the neocortex and other brain structures. Structure Nucleus basalis in relation to the globus pallidus (top of image). The nucleus basalis in humans is a somewhat diffuse collection of large cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. The main body of the nucleus basalis lies inferior to the anterior commissure and the globus pallidus, and lateral to the anterior hypothalamus in an area known as the substantia innominata. Rostrally, the nucleus basalis is continuous with the cholinergic neurons of the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca. The nucleus basalis is thought to consist of several subdivisions based on the location of the cells and their projections to other brain regions. Occasional neurons belonging to the nucleus basalis can be found in nearby locations such as the internal laminae of the globus pallidus and the genu of the internal capsule. Function The widespread connections of the nucleus basalis with other parts of the brain indicate that it is likely to have an important modulatory influence on brain function. Studies of the firing patterns of nucleus basalis neurons in nonhuman primates indicate that the cells are associated with arousing stimuli, both positive (appetitive) and negative (aversive). There is also evidence that the nucleus basalis promotes sustained attention, and learning and recall in long term memory Cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis have been hypothesized to modulate the ratio of reality and virtual reality components of visual perception.Smythies, J. (2009) Philosophy, Perception and Neuroscience. Philosophy 38, 638–51. Experimental evidence has shown that normal visual perception has two components. The first (A) is a bottom-up component in which the input to the higher visual cortex (where conscious perception takes place) comes from the retina via the lateral geniculate body and V1. This carries information about what is actually outside. The second (B) is a top-down component in which the input to the higher visual cortex comes from other areas of the cortex. This carries information about what the brain computes is most probably outside. In normal vision, what is seen at the center of attention is carried by A, and material at the periphery of attention is carried mainly by B. When a new potentially important stimulus is received, the nucleus basalis is activated. The axons it sends to the visual cortex provide collaterals to pyramidal cells in layer IV (the input layer for retinal fibres) where they activate excitatory nicotinic receptors and thus potentiate retinal activation of V1. The cholinergic axons then proceed to layers I-II (the input layer for cortico-cortical fibers) where they activate inhibitory muscarinic receptors of pyramidal cells, and thus inhibit cortico-cortical conduction. In this way activation of nucleus basalis promotes (A) and inhibits (B), thus allowing full attention to be paid to the new stimulus. Goard and Dan, and Kuo et al. report similar findings. Gerrard Reopit, in 1984, confirmed the reported findings in his research. Merzenich and Kilgard, among others, have investigated the role of the nucleus basalis in sensory plasticity. Clinical significance Neurons of the nucleus basalis are particularly vulnerable in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and several others. The resulting decrease in acetylcholine in the brain is thought to contribute to the decline in mental function of affected patients. For this reason, most currently available pharmacological treatments for dementia focus on compensating for faltering function of the nucleus basalis through artificially increasing acetylcholine levels. Because many other systems also are compromised in neurodegenerative diseases, the benefits of selectively increasing cholinergic function are limited. History The nucleus basalis is named after Theodor Meynert. Meynert originally called this group of cells the 'ganglion of the ansa peduncularis' (ganglion der Hirnschenkelschlinge), leading Albert von Kölliker in 1896 to recognize Meynert's contribution with the eponym ‘basal ganglion of Meynert’ (Meynert’sches Basalganglion). Later, in a pair of 1942 publications, Harold Brockhaus referred to the cells as the basal nucleus {Basalkern}).. In these reports, he also emphasized the continuity of the nucleus basalis proper with the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, referring to the entire collection of large cells as the basal nucleus complex (Basalkernkomplex).

Early life Verzbicas was born in Kaunas, Lithuania and moved to the US with his mother and stepfather at age nine. The family lived in Orland Park, Illinois where Verzbicas attended Carl Sandburg High School, graduating in May 2011. Verzbicas graduated at age 18 after attending high school for just 3 years. His mother is a former Lithuanian record-holder at 3,000 m. Running career High school In May 2009, Verzbicas won the Pan American Triathlon Confederation Junior Championships. In September 2009, Verzbicas won the Duathlon World Junior Championships. In December 2009, he won the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships in a time of 15:08. In June 2010, Verzbicas won the 2010 Adidas High School Boys' Dream Mile in New York City in a time of 4:04. In the fall of 2010, Verzbicas finished 4th in the ITU World Junior Triathlon Championships. Shortly afterwards, Verzbicas won the 2010 IHSA Class 3A state championship in the 3 mile run with a time of 13:53.7, only 3 seconds off the state record held by world cross country champion and three time Olympian Craig Virgin. In December 2010, he won the Foot Locker Cross Country Championships a second time, this time in a time of 14:59 Retrieved 13 December 2010 as well as the Nike Cross Nationals invitational in a time of 15:59 Retrieved 13 December 2010 becoming the first runner to win both FLCC and NXN in the same year and the third to win FLCC in consecutive years. In an interview following his 2010 FLCC victory, Verzbicas stated that after high school he would pursue either running or triathlon, not both, and that his decision would be based primarily on his running performance during the remainder of his senior year.Lukas Verzbicas 2 Time Champ Sandburg HS IL 2010 Foot Locker Championships In February 2011, Verzbicas signed a national letter of intent to run for the University of Oregon beginning in the fall of 2011.Two-Time National Cross Country Champion Lukas Verzbicas Signs NLI with Oregon Verzbicas told the Chicago Tribune he had a passion for running which he didn't have for triathlon. In March 2011, at the New Balance Indoor National meet, Verzbicas won the 5000 meters (14:06), the 2 mile (8:40), and the mile (4:10) becoming the first high school runner to win all three events at the national meet. His 5000-meter time of 14:06 stood as the high school indoor national record until February 11, 2012 when Edward Cheserek ran a 13:57 at the 105th Millrose Games.

His 3:59.71 is a Lithuanian mile outdoor record. Following the 2011 Track season, Verzbicas planned a brief return to triathlon in an attempt to win the World Junior Championships in honor of his friend and teammate Kevin McDowell who was undergoing chemotherapy following a diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma.Triathletes Lukas Verzbicas and Kevin McDowell Share Success Stories In July 2011, Verzbicas won the Pan American Triathlon Confederation Junior Championships and in September 2011 went on to win the ITU World Junior Championships in Beijing. Collegiate In November 2011, after running in only two cross country races for the University of Oregon, Verzbicas announced that he would be leaving the school to pursue a career in triathlon with the hopes of making a future US Olympic team. The timing of his decision was controversial as he left the cross country team just before a critical national qualifying race. In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Verzbicas stated that his earlier comments regarding his lack of passion for triathlon had been made before he was a world champion and that he believed he could make more of an impact on the sport of triathlon than he could on running. Professional triathlon career In 2012, Verzbicas planned to attend classes at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs in Colorado Springs, CO as member of USAT's Elite Triathlon Academy before making the decision to leave school and train full-time as a professional triathlete at the Olympic Training Center. In January 2012, citing an unspecified broken bone, Verzbicas failed to finish his first professional triathlon race, the Pan American Championships in La Paz, Argentina. However, by June 2012 Verzbicas was making waves in the professional triathlon world by defeating established professionals and olympic qualifiers to win the 2012 Dallas ITU Triathlon Pan American Cup in Dallas, TX as well as the 2012 Banyoles ITU Triathlon World Cup in Barcelona, Spain. On July 31, 2012 Verzbicas was involved in a bicycle accident while training in Colorado Springs. Bob Babbit of Competitor Magazine reported via Twitter that Verzbicas had a broken collarbone, blood in his lungs and was scheduled for back surgery the following day. The results of the surgery were released on August 14, 2012 and indicated that Verzbicas had a broken collarbone, 2 fractured vertebrae, and a collapsed lung. Verzbicas suffered post-op paralysis in his right leg but slowly regained motor control in it. 2013 Since then Verzbicas has begun training again and competed in the 2013 Carlsbad 5000.Competitor: Lukas Verzbicas To Compete At Carlsbad 5000 4 April 2013 References Category:Living people Category:1993 births Category:American people of Lithuanian descent Category:American male long- distance runners Category:American male triathletes Category:Sportspeople from Kaunas Category:People from Orland Park, Illinois Category:Sportspeople from Cook County, Illinois ","title":"Lukas Verzbicas"},{"id":"30015626","text":"Woodlawn Station can refer to several stations on rail transit systems: *Woodlawn station (Charlotte), a light rail station in Charlotte, North Carolina *Woodlawn (IRT Jerome Avenue Line), a New York City Subway station in the Bronx, New York *Woodlawn station (Metro-North), a commuter rail station in the Bronx, New York, near the Woodlawn New York City Subway station *Woodlawn railway station, a passenger rail station near Woodlawn in County Galway, Ireland *Aliquippa Station or Woodlawn Station, a defunct station in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania See also *Woodlawn (disambiguation) ","title":"Woodlawn Station"},{"id":"30015642","text":"Nice Guys may refer to: * Nice Guys (film), a 2005 film directed by Joe Eckardt * The Nice Guys, a 2016 film directed by Shane Black *The Nice Guys, comedy group James Maclurcan * Nice Guys (album), a 1978 album by the Art Ensemble of Chicago * \\"Nice Guys\\" (song), the second single from We Are Scientists' album Barbara ","title":"Nice Guys"},{"id":"30015661","text":"The 1984 Pan Pacific Open was a women's tennis tournament played on indoor carpet courts in Tokyo, Japan that was part of the Category 4 tier of the 1984 Virginia Slims World Championship Series.

The ship's tonnage was 3,027 tons burthen and Bristol displaced . The ship had a crew of 550 officers and ratings.Winfield, pp. 478–80 She had a horizontal, two-cylinder, single- expansion steam engine, built by Robert Napier and Sons, that drove a single propeller shaft using steam that was provided by four boilers. The engine produced which gave the ship a maximum speed of under steam. To improve her sailing qualities, the propeller could be hoisted into the hull. Bristol was initially equipped with thirty ML eight-inch (203 mm) smoothbore muzzle- loading guns (SBML) of 65 hundredweight on her gundeck. These guns were designed specifically to fire the latest exploding shells, unlike the traditional solid cannonballs. On her upper deck were twenty 32-pounder SBML guns that weighed 56 hundredweight and a single 68-pounder SBML gun on a pivot mount. In January 1868, the ship was rearmed with 10 eight-inch shell guns and a dozen rifled, muzzle-loading 64-pounder guns on the gundeck. Four more 64-pounders were mounted on the upper deck.Winfield, p. 478 'An analysis of ship air and its effect' was made and reported during a four months' voyage (July to November 1871) from the Cape of Good Hope to England.

The Lowest tier Stokehole, Engine room, Screw alley, Cockpit, Store room & Cells. It also states the ship had four boilers. Construction and career Bristol, named after the city of Bristol, was ordered on 9 April 1856 as part of the 1856 Naval Programme. As the design was revised several times, she was not laid down at Woolwich Dockyard until 16 September 1859. The ship was launched on 12 February 1861, but she was not commissioned until October 1865. On 10 November, she ran aground off the Nore during her sea trials. She was refloated and sailed for Portsmouth, Hampshire.

They are often used in conjunction with automatic faucets in public restrooms. They function to conserve the amount of soap used and stem infectious disease transmission. History The idea for the first automated dispenser was submitted by Guey-Chaun Shiau to be patented in 1989. The patent was under the name, \\"Automatic Cleaning-liquid Dispensing Device\\". The patent was issued in 1991. The patented device was under the following description: \\"An automatic cleaning-fluid dispensing device includes: a containing structure for containing cleaning fluid; a sensing device disposed on a base member being installed in the lower portion of said containing structure wherein said base member is provided with an outlet, a sensing circuit disposed on a circuit board, a motor arrangement electrically connected to the sensing circuit, an outlet for passing a light source of the sensing circuit therefrom so as to detect the presence of an external object closing on the light source; and a dispensing mechanism, which is composed of a push structure functionally connected with the driving motor and a pumping structure operatively engaged with the push structure, installed on the base member in connection with the sensing device; whereby when an external object closes to the sensing device, a given amount of the contained cleaning fluid in the containing structure will be automatically supplied for cleaning purposes.\\".Huppert, Michael. \\"Automatic Cleaning-liquid Dispensing Device – . Application The implementation of automatic washroom supplies has increased dramatically. An increasing number of public locations and private institutions have been incorporating touchless technology into their washrooms. Public locations Automatic technology has permeated public washrooms. Journalist Michael Sasso once termed it as, \\"Hygienic Company Brings Space Age to Bathroom.\\" He wrote in reference of the Tampa International Airport. The first automatic urinal was implemented in 1987 and in 16 years, \\"the airport had 143 automatic urinals, 390 automatic-flush commodes and 276 automatic faucets\\".Sasso, Michael. \\"Hygienic Company Brings Space Age to Bathroom.\\" Knight Ridder Tribune Business News [Washington] 24 Nov. 2003: 1. Print. Touchless technology has become a regular component of modern washroom facilities. Hospital setting A study was conducted in the accession area of the clinical microbiology laboratory and the outpatient dentistry department of the University of Virginia Medical Center. Studies were done to evaluate the particular antiseptic solution and the automatic dispensers in a hospital setting. The study was conducted for two months, at the conclusion, the effectiveness of the solution and dispenser was surveyed. Although the particular alcohol antiseptic was disliked because of the skin- drying effect of the alcohol solution, the dispenser itself was recommended for greater use throughout the healthcare facilities. The filth, poverty, disease that permeated nineteenth century’s society was drastically reduced by revolutionary sanitation movements throughout the twentieth century. Although several other advances... can be etiologically and temporally related to some of these diseases, the causal evidence (e.g., temporal sequence, consistency, biologic plausibility) is consistent with the hypothesis that personal hygiene is one other factor that helped to determine the decline. The advances of hygiene, such as that of the automatic soap dispenser, can be considered as one of the more silent victories of public health and continues to be an important disease prevention strategy, even in this \\"modern\\" era when the \\"gospel of germs\\" has waned in popularity. A strong corollary in the decline of the mortality rate is that of hand-washing (National Center for Health Statistics). Mechanisms When washing hands, the user’s hands are placed under the nozzle and before the sensor. The activated sensor will further activate a pump that dispenses a premeasured amount of soap from the nozzle. Radar-based sensor This kind of sensor sends out bursts of microwave or ultrasound energy and waits for the energy to reflect back. In a stagnant situation, the energy will bounce back in a normal pattern. When hands are placed in the basin, the energy emitted from the sensor will bounce back irregularly which triggers the dispensation of soap.Harris, Tom. \\"How Burglar Alarms Work\\" 20 February 2001. HowStuffWorks.com. 11 December 2010. Modern sensors used in electronic faucets, electronic flush valves and electronic soap dispensers use Infrared light with wavelength in the range of 850 nm. The sensor employs an emitter and a collector. The emitter emits pulses of infrared light while the collector, which is positioned to face in the same direction as the emitter, \\"sits\\" dormant waiting to sense the emitted pulses. When no hands are present in front of the device, no reflection of light takes place, and therefore, no pulse is sensed. When hands are present in the path of the emitted light, a portions of the emitted infrared light is bounced back in the direction of the collector which then becomes excited by the light (in the event a photodiode is used) and generates voltage to switch the pump on. If a photo transistor is utilized, then the photo transistor, upon sensing the infrared pulse, will simply switch the pump on.Shakkour, Fadi. http://www.macfaucets.com/howitworks Photo sensor This mechanism is composed of two parts, a source of focused light (usually a laser beam) and a light sensor. When the user’s hands are placed in line of the beam of light, the pump mechanism is activated by the disruption that is sensed by the light sensor. Passive infrared sensor Infrared sensors detect infrared energy that is emitted by one’s body heat. When hands are placed in the proximity of the sensor, the infrared energy quickly fluctuates. This fluctuation triggers the pump to activate and dispense the designated amount of soap. Advantages Touchless The advancement of the automatic soap dispenser further creates an even more sterile environment. When various individuals use the pump, they will leave behind a variety of bacterial colonies. These colonies will interbreed and lead to a more resistant strain of bacteria that can re-contaminate different hands and would not be completely eliminated by the anti-bacterial soap. Wider spectra or higher levels of resistance, in the colonies that are present, are due to interaction and/or complementation between the resistance genes. Without having a wide variety of individuals touching the pump, bacterial transmission will be eliminated. Preset increments Dispensers will only distribute a set amount of soap per motion activation. A predetermined amount to be dispensed can be set to a highly efficient quantity in which waste will be minimal. Versatility The mechanisms of the dispenser that work for soap may also work for other liquids: soap, hand sanitizer, lotion, laundry detergent etc. The wide range of possibilities extends the use of the dispenser to various other locations other than the bathroom.

Since 1990 it has been a collaboration with his life partner, artist Jean Pierre Lestrade (a.k.a Lala). The 25 cm (9.8 in) tall doll was originally made in a matte Caron make-up toned hard resin. Mdvanii debuted on February 14, 1989 in London, England.  Pre-Mdvanii History - 1980 until 1987  Mdvanii was conceived by the artist, collector, social figure, and designer BillyBoy* whose involvement with nostalgic and antique dolls started at a young age. He was a collector of antique French fashion dolls and Kamkins cloth dolls but also Barbie dolls and other vintage post-war fashion dolls since the early 1970s. He started to re-design dolls for his own amusement, re-painting and re-dressing Barbies but also other commercial dolls from the 1960s and 1970s as a teenager. He received press as early as 1978 in notably France and other European countries and the US for his work as an artist and in high fashion which frequently mentioned his passion for dolls. He also at this date had a large collection of fashion dolls, mostly Barbie dolls dressed by major fashion designers from all over the world made for him personally by the designers he befriended or knew. In 1983 he was contacted by Mattel, France after an article in French Elle magazine appeared By early 1984 he created for Mattel the “Nouveau Théatre de la Mode Barbie”, which was the first Barbie doll bearing a designer's name on its box, also well as his follow-up Barbie doll for Mattel, USA, called \\"Feelin' Groovy Barbie\\" in 1986. His book titled \\"Barbie, Her Life and Times“ was published in the US by Crown Publishers, accompanied by a world tour of a selection of his vintage and unique haute couturier dressed Barbie dolls called \\"BillyBoy* Le Nouveau Théatre de la Mode\\".His book which came out in 1987 was translated into a number of languages for many different editions including Japanese, French, Finnish and German. Launch Mdvanii debuted on Valentine's Day in 1989 after two years of development. The doll was introduced as a fashion doll, but the embodiment of an ultra-sophisticated thinking woman of a post-Feminist genre who, in this case, was bisexual. She was the first anatomically correct fashion doll with an adult (non-parody) storyline including homosexual, lesbian and bisexual personality traits. She was presented with a wardrobe of high fashion clothes made in France with identical construction as human-scale clothes. Mdvanii, referred to as \\"she\\" by the artist for which he insisted was also attributed many different intellectual attributes and a precise personality. He claimed Mdvanii had a soul and was his avatar. She was launched as the first \\"fashion doll as art\\" concept. Shortly after the Barbie years, BillyBoy* invented Mdvanii as his own \\"fashion doll\\", this time not a commercially made toy, but an artistic creation. Mdvanii is an original concept and patented sculpting, inspired by 1950s and 60s fashion dolls. http://bases-modeles.inpi.fr/Typo3_INPI_Modeles/dessins_recherche_avancee.html The looks originate from BillyBoy*'s Russian-origin mother by adoption. The doll was first made and shown in BillyBoy*'s Paris-based Surreal Bijoux showroom. The doll clothes designed by BillyBoy* which are worn by Mdvanii are made in the tradition of French haute couture and were originally made in France but since 1997 are also made in Switzerland. They use the same fabrics, embroideries and details as French fashion-makers: Lesage embroideries, Gripoix jewellery details, as well as stocks of fabrics from the collection of BillyBoy*, as Raoul Dufy printed silk satin made for Paul Poiret given to him by his daughter Perrine de Wilde (née Poiret), vintage 1940s Schiaparelli satin given to BillyBoy* by the defunct House of Schiaparelli, and a swatch of Sonia Delaunay painted silk given to BillyBoy* by Delaunay when he was a teen. Mdvanii was launched at the British department store Liberty & Co. in London, England on the initiative of Carol Lister, head fashion accessories buyer and the stores owner, Richard Stewart Liberty. Mdvanii was humanly scaled with a right and left foot, was \\"anatomically correct\\", a completely handmade and hand-painted doll. This \\"effigy\\" as BillyBoy* called the doll was made from resin in a very limited series and was a new concept. An edition of Mdvanii was made exclusively for F.A.O Schwarz and featured in their catalogues. The launch was tied-in with the premiere issue of Contemporary Doll Magazine where one of the Mdvanii F.A.O Schwarz Exclusives called Notre Dame was featured on the cover. The dolls featured in the New York store on 5th Avenue wore a wide variety of fashions and included detailed embroidered gowns which retailed for US$3,000 all the way up to $10,000 The doll's house, for which only ten examples were made, cost US$20,000. In New York City, at Bloomingdale's Mdvanii was shown during the \\"Vive La France\\" (1989) promotion, premiering for a gala to benefit The Institut Pasteur and Gay Men's Health Crisis and a display was made within the exhibition of 102 pieces of BillyBoy*'s haute couture collection. In Canada for the same show of BillyBoy*'s haute couture collection and the debut of Mdvanii it was sold exclusively through the then House of Christian Dior designer Gianfranco Ferré establishment at Le Cours Mont-Royal in Montreal Catalogues for both shows featured prominently Mdvanii and the wardrobe. Mdvanii was also represented in Paris through a boutique- gallery which was entirely decorated in Schiaparelli Shocking pink and Paul Poiret-inspired furniture designed by the artists along with originals by Poiret's school of design called Atelier Martine. On the door was written \\"Luxe, Poupées et Volupté\\", paraphrasing Charles Baudelaire's famous words “Luxe, calme et volupté”. Since the very beginning Mdvanii was represented in Japan by Sumiko Watanabe and SW Japan who had exclusive works made for her to show on a regular basis. She represents Mdvanii to this day but also the paintings of BillyBoy*.  \\"Art within art\\" concept  Since the year 1989, Mdvanii had within her world \\"art within art\\" as the creators called it. It was an express desire to showcase the creator's artist and designer friends and artists whom they admired. She had miniature artworks created by young contemporary artists and designers and her boxed Deluxe Edition Giftset ensembles. In Thailand for Image magazine a layout was given to a series of young designer's furniture made for Mdvanii. Her ensemble of the 1989 debut series, called \\"Galerie d'art d'avant-garde\\" had an edition of 200 miniature watercolours by Skall, a young painter of the era, all framed with a cast metal frame from his own art. Later artists such as Duggie Fields, Jean Marc Dallenegra, Eric Raspaut and Fabrice Janosik did paintings and photographers Antoine Giacomoni, Pierre Rutschi, Christine Spengler did images. An edition of 10 hand-painted renditions of Man Ray's painting “A l’heure de l’Observatoire, les amoureux” painted by Lala came with the ““Hommage à Schiaparelli” Deluxe Edition Giftset for Mdvanii. Her hair and wigs were designed by hairdresser Alexandre de Paris. Alexandre de Paris personally did detailed drawings for her hairstyles and his logo, which was created by Jean Cocteau is placed on all Mdvanii boxes and catalogues. One of her cosmetic face-paints of 1990 was supposed to be designed by Mel Odom but it was rejected at the last minute by BillyBoy* and never used. Instead, Mdvanii is hand-painted by BillyBoy*s life partner, artist Jean Pierre Lestrade (a.k.a Lala). The illustration on her first box, which is predominantly turquoise her signature colour, was created especially for her by French fashion illustrator Rene Gruau and her first catalogue interior sketches are by Clyde Smith, who originally did the drawings for the Random House series of Barbie doll books in the early 1960s. Texts were written for her by writers depicting her imaginary lifestyle through the eyes of each author and music, a classical waltz called \\"Hommage to Mdvanii\\" has been written and composed for Mdvanii by classical pianist Nicolas Bloomfield (GB). Poets have been inspired by Mdvanii. Poet Gerard Wozek (US) has written extensive poems about Mdvanii and her family such as her teenage brother Muio-Bix and the emerging new poet Sunil Narayan, who is American and of Indian heritage has written classical poetry tomes to Soraya, Mdvanii's psychic Indian friend and her brother, the Bollywood-inspired gay teenage boy called Ishwar. She has been shown in a number of music videos. In the early 1990s, for the song \\"Little Susie\\" BillyBoy* art directed and starred in a video for the Japanese girl group Suzy Susie. Of recent, there was notably that of Lala's songs from his album, Lala \\"Succès damnés\\" (The Lost Album). \\"Edie Superstar\\" showed a \\"Mdvaniiism\\" of Mdvanii paintings and dolls and \\"L'Amour n'a pas de prix\\" which was created especially for Diane Pernet's \\"ASVOFF 3 - A Shaded View of Fashion Film 3\\" (A Shaded View of Fashion Film - her film festival dedicated to fashion) which had its premiere in September 2010 at the Centre national d'art et de culture Georges-Pompidou, Paris, France. It was called \\"Mdvaniiism - Classic Mdvanii Haute Couture 1989–1993, A Homage to Monsieur Yves Saint Laurent\\". Mdvanii has been photographed by many known photographers including Studio Harcourt for The Sunday Times Magazine in London, England. Guy Bourdin did a cover try for Harper's Bazaar, Paris in 1989.  Press Reception  Mdvanii has had international press in a number of publications such as “Beautiful But No Bimbo: A Doll For The 1990s\\" in The New York Times,Vogue, Vogue Hommes International, Harper's Bazaar Elle, Glamour, Actuel (France),Playboy, ARTnews, The Sunday Times Magazine (Great Britain) and Paris, L'Officiel. Mdvanii was briefly advertised in the specialized Barbie doll collector's magazine called Barbie Bazaar for a few years in the early 1990s.  Reception in the Contemporary Art World and the Doll Collectors World  As Mdvanii was received into a variety of milieux, both the doll collecting world and the contemporary art world she had overlapping reactions to her. The Mdvanii doll created some confusion as doll collectors thought that BillyBoy*, being so well known and media-ized for his involvement with Barbie doll by Mattel was making a higher end type of doll for doll collectors. She was seen as an appealing fashion doll, but due to her high cost (from US$500 up to US$10,000) led to frustration amongst fashion doll, notably Barbie doll collectors. There was also some doubt in among European art critics, and the concept of an apparent fashion doll was controversial as a work of contemporary art and was not easily accepted even to those to whom she appealed and those who actually purchased her. Though she was thought of and referred to as une oeuvre d'art, it was debated regularly. She was however immediately acquired by major museums as early as 1990 and slowly over the first ten years exhibitions in art museums and sales in public art auctions in prestigious auction houses like Hotel Drouot in Paris were forthcoming. Mdvanii is in many of the world's museums: Mdvanii is included in Le Musée de Louvre in the L’Union centrale des arts décoratifs (UCAD), Musée de la Mode et du Textile (UFAC), which is part of Musée des Arts Décoratifs inaugurated by the Union Française des Arts du Costume in Paris. She is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and in private collections of art and dolls in the world. She has soon acquired by people such as Jackie Onassis, Mr. & Mrs Norman Mailer, Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler and Sonia Rykiel The late Kelly Cole, adopted son of Nat King Cole and brother of singer Natalie Cole would offer his sister the first Dheei doll, best friend to Mdvanii.  Exhibitions and Presentations  In 1993, while BillyBoy* was working on the porcelain version of Mdvanii, the resin Mdvanii is presented as the “Ambassadrice of French High Fashion” by the magazine L’Officiel and was dressed by Thierry Mugler, Torrente, Louis Féraud, Guy Laroche and Révillon Haute Fourrure and other French haute couturiers and fashion houses, for Révillon she was presented during the runway fashion shows along with the human-sized furs. L’Officiel ran a 14-page feature story on BillyBoy* and Mdvanii titled “L’incroyable BillyBoy*”. In this article she is shown wearing couture clothes and haute joaillerie by jewelmakers such as Van Cleef and Arpels, Harry Winston, Boucheron and Cartier. She is represented as the \\"L'Officiel Ambassadrice of French Haute Couture\\" (“Mdvanii, Mascot of Paris High Fashion”) and was available in a 1940s-inspired Liberty & Co. print outfit designed by BillyBoy* with a subscription through the magazine. She was photographed on a special cover for the magazine. These dolls had a special woven label with the L'Officiel logo in all the garments. The porcelain versions of Mdvanii as are all the tribe of her friends, lovers and family (of which there are 15 members) are made in Sèvres, France. It was BillyBoy*'s express wish to keep within this French tradition. It was at this point that BillyBoy*, on the advice of Lala, started referring to Mdvanii as \\"a sculpture with a lifestyle\\". BillyBoy* did a series of portraits in black and white which feature Mdvanii and the other characters in her world in 1992–1993 and were shown in the FNAC photography galleries in Paris as well as the main cities of their spaces throughout France from 1993 to 1996. The show included large silkscreen paintings of Mdvanii. The traveling show was called \\"Les photographies de BillyBoy* - Le Jardin secret de Mdvanii”. A text was written for the occasion by gay author Edmund White. Dheei, Mdvanii's Afro-European female lover came out in 1990, described as \\"Intelligent, Beautiful, Elegant\\". It was at the beginning of the 1990s that Rhogit-Rhogit, Mdvanii's tattooed bisexual lover was introduced along with his Afro-European lover Zhdrick, Dheei's brother. They came in Basic Stud versions as well as Deluxe Edition Giftsets. The male dolls came with human-sized condoms. Since this period most Mdvanii dolls came with condoms and continue to do so to this day and their first catalogues had a Safe Sex campaign written into them and the Mdvanii storyline. In 1992, a limited-edition of 1200 signed and number Mdvanii boardgames came out, called \\"Mdvanii Society\\". The game was evocative of the type of teenage boardgames of the 1960s but aimed at a very adult audience with references to Parisian high fashion, Parisian mondaine society, sex, notably LGBT and Queer storylines and Karma. In 2008 Mdvanii had a brand of cigarettes distributed in Switzerland, flavoured with honey and licorice which came in a box marked \\"This Is A Work Of Art\\" and \\"Mdvaniiism de BillyBoy* & Lala\\". 500 packages were signed by the artists before being assembled and it was indicated that you may discover the signatures if the box was disassembled. It was also indicated that it should be considered a work of art. In 1992, a larger, 60 centimeters articulated version of Mdvanii was made, called \\"Mademoiselle Mdvanii\\", made in porcelain and in a limited series. She would later be made also of a very hard composition papier-maché. By 2005, a slightly larger Mdvanii 30 centimeters was made in resin and papier maché and were referred to as \\"Cyber Sexual Mdvanii\\". In 1995 and 1996, in collaboration with AIDS-awareness and prevention group Arcat-Sida, FNAC, Vogue, Paris and Vogue Hommes International Mdvanii is again dressed by haute couturiers, and notably paired with Rhogit-Rhogit also dressed by these designers. The designers included: Bernard Sanz for Pierre Balmain, Sonia Rykiel, Myriam Schaefer for Nina Ricci prêt-à-porter, Michel Klein for Guy Laroche, Missoni, Givenchy Monsieur, Louis Féraud, Francesco Smalto, Walter Von Bierendonck, Stéphane Plassier, Lloyd Klein for The House of Grès, José Lévy, Claude Montana, Giorgio Armani, Paul Smith, Ozwald Boateng, Kenzo, Nuno Gama, Ricci Club (of the House of Nina Ricci), Josephus Thimister for Balenciaga and Dolce & Gabbana. In autumn 2000, the \\"INTRO SPECTRUM\\" collection was presented by Sumiko Watanabe in Tokyo, Japan. Watanabe explains that \\"in the first years of porcelain production, Mdvanii and her clan represented a myriad lifestyles but as the exploration of the artists continued, the world of Mdvanii delved deeper into the universe of the human psyche\\", embodied by the Intro Spectrum Collection of \\"ultra-visionary high fashion art dolls\\". By 2000–2001, the artists, BillyBoy* & Lala, (though Lala was making Mdvanii with BillyBoy* from the very start and it was mentioned as such in the press he was credited more regularly by the Mdvanii cognescenti to have been working on Mdvanii creations as of 1994), the first show which had his name officially to appear was an exposition at Maison d'Ailleurs Museum of Science Fiction, Utopia and Extraordinary Journeys titled “Mdvanii, Memories from Earth - The artworks of BillyBoy* and Lala\\". It was curated by the museum's chief curator, Patrick Gyger. This exhibition featured futuristic Mdvanii artworks (photography, paintings, drawings and sculptures) as well as BillyBoy*’s early works (Mister Modern collages, and paintings). It is also the first time officially and publicly that the Mdvanii work is acknowledged as the osmosis work of BillyBoy* and Lala. In 2004, the exhibition with accompanying book “Poupées” at La Halle Saint Pierre museum in Paris: 100 pieces of BillyBoy* & Lala Mdvanii art works and creations were featured in the exhibition, as well as photographs and paintings. Two Mdvaniis were featured on the poster for the exhibition. In November 2006 - February, 2007, the exhibition “Mdvanii, Ceci n'est pas une poupée” was presented at the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts (Lausanne, Switzerland) and Musée de l’Elysée. For the Museum of Contemporary Design and Applied Arts, the show was curated by the museum's chief curator art and design expert Chantal Prod'Hom and for the Musée de l'Élysée, the show was curated by world-famous photography historian and museum chief curator William A. Ewing. The 80-page exhibition catalogue was called simply \\"BillyBoy\\" & Lala\\" and featured an interview between the curators and the artists speaking about Mdvanii as a conceptual art piece and her evolution. Manifesto Mdvaniiism and \\"This Is A Work Of Art\\" - Mid-1990s until Today The artists as of 1989 called their work a \\"Mdvaniiism\\" between themselves and those who knew them however in the mid-1990s started to use this term publicly for the work By their definition a Mdvaniiism is \\"anything which evokes Mdvanii but does not necessarily or actually show her or even a human image\\". They claim to express Mdvaniiisms and their \\"Manifesto Mdvaniiism\\" as \\"Transgressive Queer Art\\" and use this -ism as a vehicle to express Outsider sensibilities through the paradox of her Old School acceptability. Therefore, a Mdvaniiism can be anything glamorous which evokes Mdvanii, anything complimenting the intellectual concept of Mdvanii or anything which the artists give their approbation to. As of the early 2000s they have used a stamp which reads, \\"Mdvaniiism de BillyBoy* & Lala\\" and also often stamped, \\"This Is A Work Of Art\\" and \\"Manifesto Mdvaniiism de BillyBoy* & Lala\\". One of the most recent Mdvaniiisms was three performances which commenced on March 30, 2009 by BillyBoy* & Lala in Carouge, Switzerland at Flux Laboratory based on the unpublished but often excerpted memoires of BillyBoy* entitled\\"My American Family, In One Era, Out The Other\\". The event was called \\"Was BillyBoy* Barbie's Be-atch?\\"/ Identity. While BillyBoy* sat on a small stage and read his manuscript in regard to his experiences designing Barbie various photos of his career with the commercial doll and television commercials were shown behind him. The recital included an improvised dance performance using trompe l'oeil knit outfits of iconic Barbie clothes of 1959 (which BillyBoy* created in 1984 after designs he made in the 1970s) to tribal-like music BillyBoy* had recorded in 2008 called \\"Vroom Vroom\\" (appearing as a guest on Lala's recent album). This all took place in a gallery room hung with a series of 20 silkscreen paintings making a parody of the Warhol painting representing Barbie which BillyBoy* inspired the artist to create (according to Warhol in his diaries). This Warhol painting, created just before the artist died, was offered as a gift to BillyBoy* and was notably called \\"Portrait of BillyBoy*\\" by Warhol as a personal ironic joke between them It was first seen in the book on Barbie which BillyBoy* wrote. The parody of this painting represents a cartoonish Warhol-like head with doll-like hair and a somewhat jaded cellphone-type message face replacing the features. In addition ten gigantic cubes, representing children's toy blocks had the same image looking as if it was worn and old. The ensemble and interaction of these various BillyBoy* & Lala works expressed BillyBoy*'s disillusionment working for Mattel, Barbie's creator and with the stereotyped concept of the American Dream and represented perfectly an example of the Manifesto Mdvaniiism de BillyBoy* & Lala. On the occasion of the March 13, 2008 Nuit du Quartier des Bains in Geneva, Switzerland, \\"Chez Soi, The Liquid Screen House of Tomorrow\\" Un Mdvaniiisme de BillyBoy* & Lala\\" in collaboration with furniture designer Philippe Cramer was shown at Cramer + Cramer, the designer's showroom. BillyBoy*'s paintings and sculptures were shown with the Mdvanii works as part of her world. The work represented two futuristic dolls houses conceived by BillyBoy* modeled on his paintings and the designer created the interiors. One was called \\"Chez Soi - Jour\\" and the other \\"Chez Soi - Nuit\\". For 2011, there is work by Swiss photographer Frédéric Charrière which has been created in an extremely Deluxe Edition Giftset; a portfolio of original prints presented in a unique box made especially for the dressed Mdvanii doll. Fashion designers Anthony Villarreal (US), Laurent Mercier (Paris) and custom-made high fashion glovemaker Daniel Storto, (US) are amongst the guest designers.

History The unit was activated on 15 December 1941 at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The unit saw action throughout World War II and earned campaign participation in Algeria-French Morocco, Tunisia, Naples-Foggia, Anzio, Rome-Arno, North Apennines, and the Po Valley. The 701st was inactivated on 29 October 1945 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The unit was converted and redesignated on 27 August 1947 as the 327th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, and allotted to the Organized Reserves. It was again converted and redesignated on 22 March 1949 as the 327th Heavy Tank Battalion. On 17 November 1950, it was inactivated at Ottumwa, Iowa only to be converted and redesignated on 27 February 1951 as the 701st Armored Infantry Battalion; concurrently, withdrawn from the Organized Reserve Corps, allotted to the Regular Army, and assigned to the 1st Armored Division. On 7 March 1951, the 701st AIB moved to Fort Hood, Texas for a period of six years until it was inactivated on 15 February 1957 at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and relieved from assignment to the 1st Armored Division. In March 2004, the 71st Cavalry was activated from newly assigned Soldiers as well as existing units from the Division. 11 months after activation, 1-71 CAV deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom IV. The squadron began combat operation throughout AO Cobra in Western Baghdad, with a primary mission as the Military Transition Team (MiTT), partnered up with 1st Brigade, 6th Division of the Iraqi Army. In late February and through much of May, the squadron surged in response to an attack on the Samara Mosque. Intense 24-hour patrols throughout AO Cobra saturated the area, showing support for the Iraqi people and the Iraqi Security Forces. Throughout this time, the squadron’s efforts assisted in easing sectarian tensions during a tenuous time. By the first of April, the squadron was released from the MiTT mission and tasked with a new AO on the western outskirts of Baghdad. AO Ghost included the strategic target Abu Ghraib compound and 18 kilometers of corps MSR. Throughout this period, the squadron once again was forced into a non- contiguous battlefield with a command and control node at Abu Ghraib. The rural environment of AO Ghost is the antithesis to that of the urban AO Cobra, enlisting the soldiers of 1-71 CAV to adapt over the course of six months to new, wide-open surroundings. 1-71 CAV redeployed with 1BCT, 10th Mountain Division in July 2006. The unit recovered and prepared for another tour in Iraq. The squadron is currently deployed conducting operations as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

She was the last wooden frigate built at Deptford Dockyard. She was commissioned in 1866 and spent much of her service based at Malta. In 1869–70 she sailed around the world as part of a Flying Squadron. She remained in front-line service until 1874. Endymion then served as a guard ship at Hull, Yorkshire until 1879, latterly with her boilers condemned as unfit for service. A plan to use her as a flagship at Harwich, Essex from 1875 was abandoned due to the loss of . During her time at Hull, crew from Endymion assisted the local police in fighting a number of fires in buildings and timber yards. Emdymion was lent to the Metropolitan Asylums Board in 1881 for use as an administration and hospital ship, initially at Greenwich, Kent and later at Dartford. She was sold out of service in 1885, and served as an administration ship until 1904. Endymion was sold in December 1904 and broken up in 1905. Description Endymion was long, with a beam of , and a draught of . She was designed with a beam of and a burthen of 2,478 tons BOM and displaced 3,197 tons. She was to be fitted with 36 guns and had a complement of 450. Propulsion was by a steam engine of 500 nominal horsepower, which was built by Napier & Sons, Glasgow. The engine drove a single screw propeller of diameter and pitch. The propeller was long, and the tips of the blades were beneath the surface of the water. She was also rigged as a full-rigged ship. Construction Endymion was the last wooden frigate built at Deptford. Her keel was laid down on 20 October 1860. She was built on the same slip that had been vacated by the launch of . On 1 February 1862, construction of Endymion was suspended on the orders of the Admiralty, although the Admiralty later decided that she would be completed. Construction restarted on 7 February 1864. Her engines and boilers were transported from Deptford to Sheerness in October 1865 on board HMS Dee and HMS Monkey. She was launched on 18 November 1865, and was then towed by the steamships Locust, Monkey and Widgeon to Woolwich, where they awaited for the tide before Endymion was towed to Sheerness for completion. Endymion was launched by Miss Ffrench, the daughter of Major Ffrench of the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot. A crowd of 40,000 people was present. By January 1866, Endymion was ready to have her lower masts fitted, following which her bottom was to be coppered. She was designed to take 36 (later 30) guns, which were intended to comprise twenty-two 32-pounder smooth-bore and eight 64-pounder rifled muzzle- loading guns. However she was completed with four 100-pounder, rifled muzzle- loading guns (weight 125 Cwt/6,350 kg each), fourteen 8-inch guns (65 Cwt/3,302 kg each), located on the maindeck; and nine 110-pounder breech- loading guns (82 Cwt/6,166 kg each) located on the upper deck.

In June 1881, the Lords of the Admiralty agreed to lend and Endymion to the Metropolitan Asylums Board along with a steam pinnace, due to an epidemic of smallpox in London. Endymion was to serve as an administration ship. She was towed out of Chatham on 25 June and towed to Greenwich, Kent on 29 June. She was to be used as a hospital ship for patients infected with smallpox, although Endymion was supposed to be an administrative ship. Atlas was acquired by the board on 4 June, and Endymion on 5 July. The plans for the conversion of Atlas and Endymion were drawn up by Messrs A & C Hartson, the architects to the board. A gangway connected the two ships. Conversion of Atlas and Endymion cost £11,000. Endymion provided accommodation for the staff serving on the ships, as well as kitchen and laundry facilities. She also provided heating for the ships, as well as laundry and the repair of the patient's clothes being done on board. The location of the ships drew an objection from the shipbuilders Messrs Rennie because some of their employees refused to work near the riverside where Atlas was moored. It was also necessary to move Atlas and Endymion every time Rennie's launched a ship. In 1882, the Thames Conservancy wrote to the Metropolitan Asylums Board urging them to move Atlas and Endymion from Greenwich. The Thames Conservancy also called upon the board to pay a large claim for expenses incurred by Messrs Rennie's. At a meeting of the board, it was suggested that if moved, Atlas should be used for convalescent patients. The board decided to await the report from a Royal Commission into infectious diseases hospitals before deciding whether or not to move the ships.

Biography Samuel Brejar is the pseudonym of Gilberto Yabar-Valdez. Samuel Brejar was born in Lima, Peru, on July 28, 1941. He was the grandson of Orihuelo-Yabar, a well-known and wealthy landowner in the Andes of southern Peru. His origins from his father side were a mix of Spanish and Italian ancestry. From his mother side, Samuel Brejar was part Quechua (i.e., Native Americans of Peru). Samuel Brejar studied with the Jesuits in Lima. When his father suddenly died in a car accident while he was 16 years old, he had to start working while pursuing his studies in the evening. He then became aware of the harsh reality of the working class in Peru. This period in his life allows us to understand its communist political commitments. In addition, deeply anti-war, he changed his birth certificate in order to avoid military service. He soon suffered the consequences of his political commitments, as he was imprisoned and tortured. On several occasions, he was arrested in the street of Lima and sent straight away into exile in Chile or Argentina. In the early 70s, Samuel Brejar moved to Mexico where he met Noëlle Vuillermoz, a French student in ethno-history. They fell in love and he settled in France. They lived a few years in Paris and moved to Brittany. Samuel Brejar was the friend of the Mexican poet, Fracisco Azuela. Samuel Brejar died in October 2006. Poetic and Theatrical Work The purpose of Samuel Brejar's life has always been writing poetry and theatre. In Peru and Mexico, Samuel Brejar had the opportunity to publish his first poems (e.g., \\"Todas las mordazas\\", 1965, \\"Hallazgos del comportamiento raro\\", 1967, \\"Legajos del archivista\\", 1969, \\"Los cantos destruidos\\", 1970, \\"Cuentero del duende\\", 1971, \\"Palabras matadas\\", 1972). However, it is France that Samuel Brejar wrote most of his poetic and theatrical works. Poetry and Theatre Poetry: \\"Writings of the Andean\\", 1978, \\"The Exiliades\\", 1981, \\"Slang of the Horde\\", 1983, \\"Ariel archives\\", 1985, \\"Book of words\\", 1992, \\"Qori Kontur\\", 2001.

Journals From June 1993 to December 2006, Samuel Brejar published “Rimbaud Revue” (i.e., semi-annual journal of international literature) in collaboration with his wife Noëlle Yabar-Valdez. Rimbaud Revue focused on new poets and writers, Spanish or French work from Europe or Latin America with a large selection of poems, essays, studies, critics, chronics, stories, interviews, translations, reproductions of contemporary art, presentation of books and other revues.

Career In the late 1970s, Walsh became part of Father Michael Cleary's All Priests Show as an Elvis impersonator. He was dropped from the show in the 1980s following rumours of child abuse, which were not reported to the Gardaí. He was known as a \\"singing\\" priest. Convictions In December 2010 he was sentenced to 123 years in prison for child abuse. The sentences were to be served concurrently, netting to a maximum of 16 years. At the time it was the most severe sentence imposed on a clerical child sex abuser in Ireland. All of the 14 charges which Walsh was convicted of involved acts of child sex abuse which occurred from the mid 1970s to mid 1980s. In December 2018, Walsh received an additional 3 1/2 year prison sentence, which will also be served concurrently, after he plead guilty to indecently assaulting a teenage boy with a crucifix in 1983. Archbishop Diarmuid Martin apologised to Walsh's victims and admitted that the church had failed them. Murphy Report Chapter 19 of the Murphy Report was released by a High Court ruling on 15 December 2010 following the trial. On 17 December 2010 the Irish Times published the following quote from the report: > \\"Fr Tony Walsh is probably the most notorious child sexual abuser to have > come to the attention of the Commission...

Sokolowski, a former political prisoner, was shot and killed by East German border troops while attempting to cross the Berlin Wall near to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building. Life Heinz Sokolowski was born on 17 December, 1917, in Frankfurt an der Oder, Imperial Germany, during the First World War. Following primary school, he apprenticed as a tailor before attending a trade school where he completed his education, eventually becoming a journalist with the Frankfurt Oder Zeitung. During World War II, Sokolowski was drafted into the Wehrmacht, fighting in various places and was also used as a war correspondent, before being captured by the Red Army in Russia during the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Sokolowski became a prisoner of war under custody of the Soviet Union, and supposedly became a communist while participating in an working group. In 1946, shortly after the war ended, Sokolowski was released from Soviet captivity in 1946 and moved into the Soviet sector of Berlin, where he worked as a freelance journalist. The following year, he married and moved to Prenzlauer Berg with his wife and newborn daughter. The marriage lasted until 1951, and he worked for the Soviets until his arrest on 12 February 1953. A military tribunal found Sokolowski guilty on charges of espionage, and sentenced him at first to twenty years, then to ten years, imprisonment in a labor camp in the Soviet Union. A few years later, the Soviets handed him over to the custody of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1956, during which he contracted tuberculosis. Death On 13 February 1963, Sokolowski was released from prison and began working as an elevator operator in East Berlin, while also having applied to leave East Germany, but was not approved for emigration. He made contacts in West Berlin in 1964, bringing him to the attention of the Stasi. After his dismissal as an elevator operator in May 1965, Sokolowski quickly began to plan his escape, which began at 5 AM on 25 November 1965. That morning, Sokolowski neared the border by Clara-Zetkin-Straße (now Dorotheenstraße) close the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag building when an East German border guard saw him and fired a warning shot, but he failed to respond. Other guards opened fire on Sokolowski, who had by this time reached the last wall topped with barbed wire. Sokolowski was shot in the abdomen and died of his injuries on the way to the hospital. Memorial The original Sokolowski White Cross The new Sokolowski White Cross A three-meter-high cross was erected at the corner of Ebertstraße and Scheidemannstraße on 13 August 1966 in memory of Heinz Sokolowski. Inscribed upon this cross are his dates of birth and death and the legend \\"Nach 7 Jahren DDR-Haft erschossen auf der Flucht\\". Sokolowski is also remembered with a White Cross on the Reichstagufer.

The College has facilities that are a result of a refurbishment of the former Heidelberg High School, and a merger of the Latrobe and Banksia Secondary Colleges in 2008. Specialist areas such as engineering and instrumental music have specialist facilities and equipment. Other facilities include two full sized basketball stadia, three synthetic grass tennis courts, a horticulture centre, a large canteen and a 203-seat theatre. The College owns and operates two buses. In recent years more and more wall space has been used to display the artwork currently produced by students.

AIZ Accessed 12/12/10 In 1984, the Deaf Facility was established at Heidelberg High School as a pilot project. It commenced in Term Two with Teachers of the Deaf, Interpreters, Notetakers, and 14 Deaf students. These students came from various settings throughout the state including Victorian College for the Deaf, Glendonald School for the Deaf and students on Visiting Teacher Services. Students travelled from all over Melbourne and country Victoria, and due to the success of this Facility, other primary and secondary facilities have been established throughout Victoria. Deaf Facility Accessed 12/12/10 History Education in the greater Heidelberg area has undergone a large transformation in the past twenty years. Heidelberg High School was opened in 1956. The nearby Heidelberg Technical School was opened in 1955. Heidelberg Girls' High School was opened in 1957, and Rosanna High School opened soon after. As a result of declining enrolments in the area, due to an ageing population, amalgamations occurred, which saw Heidelberg Girls' HS become Waterdale High School and Rosanna High School become Latrobe High School. Eventually, Waterdale High School closed, and in 1989, Heidelberg High School amalgamated with Heidelberg Technical School and Latrobe High School to become Banksia Secondary College. The College was refurbished and re-opened on the old Heidelberg High School site in 1991. 2008 saw Latrobe Secondary College (formerly Macleod Technical School) amalgamate with Banksia Secondary College (formerly Heidelberg High School) to form Banksia Latrobe Secondary College. The school was closed and in 2012 the City of Banyule acquired part of the former Banksia LaTrobe Secondary College in Bellfield to allow for high-end residential infill development and also enable revenue to be generated for Council. The Bellfield Urban Design Guidelines were developed and adopted by Council in February 2019.

She was born in Klæbu, Sør-Trøndelag, to the farmer Anders Halvorsen Løvaas (c. 1730) and his wife Maren Larsdatter Forsæt (c. 1744). On 25 May 1797, Solem married the soldier Haagen Erichsen Nideng, who died the following year. While she was mourning she was visited in Trondheim by Hans Nielsen Hauge, leader of the Haugean Movement (haugianere). She was influenced by his engaging speeches, and traveled with him across the country and helped him with book binding in Bergen the following year. Hauge became quickly aware of her leading abilities. In 1802, Solem was mentioned in a small publication as one of five out of thirty people he gave status as one of the \\"oldest\\" or most respected. She was at that time only 26 years old. Before being married again, Solem skied across the Dovre Mountains to preach in the eastern regions, and was, according to Inger Furseth, a \\"courageuos and fearless woman\\". At some point after 1800 she married the one year younger Arent Solem, who was a successful businessman in Trondheim. They often held Haugean meetings in their house, where Solem developed her religious beliefs. She became interested in the works of N. F. S. Grundtvig and wanted to popularise his thoughts in Norway. After Hauge's death, Solem moved with her husband to Christiania (now Oslo) in 1824. Here, Arent established more successful enterprises, and Solem became increasingly interested in Grundtvig's thoughts.

The episode originally aired on NBC on December 9, 2010. Plot At lunch on the final day of classes, Abed believes that the upcoming Christmas is the most important Christmas ever due to his perception of the entire group as being stop-motion animated. While the group is worried about Abed's mental health, he decides to commit to the format, singing along to a Christmas version of the show's theme song until he is tasered by campus security in the parking lot while jumping on top of cars. In a meeting with Professor Duncan alongside Britta and Jeff, Abed rejects Duncan's proposal for extensive therapy sessions to discover the cause of his delusion in favor of searching for the meaning of Christmas. While Britta and Jeff worry about Abed potentially being expelled from school, Duncan is more interested having his work on Abed's case published. After working on a snowman outside, who is revealed to be Señor Chang, Abed is lured into a group therapy session in the library study room with Duncan, Jeff, Britta, Annie, Shirley, Troy and Pierce. He agrees to allow Duncan to use \\"Christmas-nosis\\" to transport him to the Planet Abed with the entire group. Upon arriving on the Christmas-themed planet, Abed sets out with the group to find the meaning of Christmas at the North Pole, but Duncan insists that they first visit the Cave of Frozen Memories. Along the way, Duncan ejects Shirley from the fantasy with a remote-controlled Christmas pterodactyl after she insists that she already knows the meaning of Christmas, while Jeff is eaten alive by a swarm of humbugs attracted to his sarcasm. Arriving at the Cave of Frozen Memories, Duncan asks Abed to access his repressed memories, but in the process of demonstrating the technique, Duncan reveals that his father was absent from his childhood Christmases and leaves the fantasy distressed. Abed initiates a self-destruct sequence and leaves the cave with Pierce, Troy and Annie, but asks Britta to stay behind in the crumbling cave (i.e. leave the fantasy) because she tricked him into therapy. The group boards a train headed to the North Pole, and Pierce leaves the fantasy after having eaten all of the cookies in the study room. Abed talks about how his mother comes to visit on December 9th every year and watches Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with him. However, he is confused when Troy reminds him that the date is December 9. Duncan arrives on the train and tells Abed that he knows the reason for his delusion, but Abed climbs to the top of the train and races to the front of the car, with Annie and Troy stopping Duncan from chasing after him. Pierce returns to Abed's fantasy, saying that the Christmas season is depressing at home by himself. The two arrive at Santa's workshop at the North Pole, where Abed finds a package that he believes to contain the meaning of Christmas, but actually contains a DVD set of the first season of Lost, which he says symbolizes lack of payoff. Duncan returns and shows Abed a Christmas card from his mother that he found in his dorm room, in which his mother tells him that she won't be visiting him for Christmas this year in order to spend the holiday with her new family. Upon hearing this, Abed is frozen in a block of ice. However, the entire group returns to support Abed. They attack Duncan with personalized \\"Christmas guns\\" and a musical number before ejecting him from the fantasy with the Christmas pterodactyl, which subsequently explodes. An unfrozen Abed says realizes that \\"The meaning of Christmas is the idea that Christmas has meaning. And it can mean whatever we want.\\" The group leaves the fantasy and returns to the study room, where they agree to keep the stop- motion fantasy going through the holiday. They later watch Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer together in Abed's dorm room, and a reflection of the real-life characters is seen in the television. During the final scene, Abed and Troy sit in the study room still in stop-motion. While Abed is worried since it wasn't he who made them stop-motion this time, Troy assures him that he wanted it this time. The two then decide to switch heads with one another. Production The episode was written by series creator Dan Harmon and Dino Stamatopoulos, who co-founded the production house used for the episode, Starburns Industries. Stamatopoulos portrays a minor character called Star- Burns in the series and is also the creator of the stop-motion animated series Moral Orel and Mary Shelley's Frankenhole. The episode was directed by Duke Johnson. It was made in the style of Rankin/Bass' stop motion Christmas specials, such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town. Dan Harmon stated in an interview with TV Guide that \\"There's a reason for it to be stop-motion animated, but it's not a dream. It still exists within the reality of the show.\\" The production of the episode was overseen by owners of 23D Films and also Starburns Industries co-founders, James Fino and Joe Russo II (not to be confused with Joe Russo, a director and executive producer on Community). The animation process was completed in four months, less than half the time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons. Fino said animators of the films Coraline and The Nightmare Before Christmas also contributed to the animation. On August 1, 2010, creator Dan Harmon informed Dino Stamatopoulos and Joe Russo that NBC had approved the idea of an animated episode. Two weeks later, Harmon and Stamatopoulos finished the script, and the art department began production on the sets and puppets. Animation began on October 18, though a week later they discovered Pierce was in a wheelchair and had to add a stop-motion wheelchair. One day prior to airing, the completed shots were handed in by 23D Films. Russo said about the project, \\"We wondered if we could do it. But we knew we'd regret it down the road if we weren't part of this, producing a special episode of a really cool show.\\" Cultural references The episode loosely follows the plot of The Polar Express, while serving as an homage to stop motion Christmas specials such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town. When Shirley and Jeff are ejected from Abed's Christmas wonderland, Abed and Annie each sing a short moralistic song about their transgressions, similar to those sung by the Oompa Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Abed finds the meaning of Christmas in a Christmas gift with the first season of Lost on DVD, saying the metaphor means \\"lack of payoff\\", later saying \\"The meaning of Christmas is the idea that Christmas has meaning. And it can mean whatever we want...Thanks Lost.\\" When Duncan and Troy teleport, they do so by taking a deep breath and holding their nose. This is identical to the method used in the 1970s British children's television series Rentaghost. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\" was viewed by an estimated 4.295 million viewers receiving a 1.9 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The overall viewership was adjusted down for NBC due to NFL game local broadcasts in Indianapolis and Nashville. The episode tied with the rating from the previous episode, \\"Mixology Certification\\". The episode received positive reviews from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode with an A, commenting that \\"What \\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\" gets that very, very few Christmas specials or episodes have gotten in the history of the medium is the fact that, ultimately, this holiday, more than any other, is intensely personal.\\" TV Squad writer Maggie Furlong called the episode \\"as touching and poignant as this show has ever been\\". Awards The character animator Drew Hodges won an Emmy Award for Individual Achievement in Animation at Creative Arts Emmys 2011, making it the first and only Emmy for the show despite not being nominated in major categories.http://www.tvline.com/2011/09/emmy- awards-2011-creative-arts-winners/ References External links *\\"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas\\" at NBC.com  Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Christmas television episodes Category:Community (season 2) episodes Category:Stop-motion animated television episodes ","title":"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas"},{"id":"30016431","text":"Double indemnity is a clause or provision in a life insurance or accident policy.

The first was from 1853 to 1861, the second Department of the East, from 1863 to 1873, and the last from 1877 to 1913.National Archives, Guide to Federal Records; Records of United States Army Continental Commands, 1821-1920 (Record Group 393), 1817-1940 (bulk 1817-1920) History As part of a major reorganization of the Western Territories, after October 31, 1853 the division echelon was eliminated and the six western departments consolidated into four (Departments of Texas, New Mexico, the West, and the Pacific). The four departments (1st-4th) of the Eastern Division were similarly consolidated into the Department of the East, with boundaries encompassing all the states east of the Mississippi River. It remained thus until August 17, 1861, when the American Civil War, created a need for a vast increase in the Union Army and more departments to administer them and the Department of the East was discontinued. On January 3, 1863, the Department of the East was revived, to administer the many districts and posts created by the Civil War in New York, New Jersey and the states of New England. It became subordinate to the Military Division of the Atlantic, from 1865 to 1866 and the Division of the Atlantic, in 1868 until this department was discontinued in 1873. Again the Department of the East was revived in 1877, once again subordinate to the Division of the Atlantic, until the Division was discontinued in 1891. In 1911, it became subordinate to a new Eastern Division, until the Department of the East was discontinued 1913, being replaced by the Eastern Department. The Panama Canal Department was created as a separate formation on 26 June 1917 by separation from the Eastern Department. The Eastern Department was discontinued when the Army's command was reorganized by the 1920 amendment to the 1916 Defense Act.Records of United States Army Continental Commands, 1821-1920 It was replaced by the Second Corps Area.

Bankhead, when he made his headquarters at Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, Maryland.

It was written by Jeff Grubb and Ed Greenwood, and published in 1988 by TSR. It includes extensive and detailed maps of the city of Waterdeep, and was intended to serve as a companion to Waterdeep and the North. The sheer expanse of the maps drew praise from Ken Rolston of Dragon magazine, although he criticized their lack of personality and utility. Contents City System maps the city of Waterdeep in detail on ten large color maps, with another map that shows the city as a whole, and another that plots the interior of Castle Waterdeep. A booklet includes keys to the maps, city encounter tables, information on typical non-player characters, and data on the city's legal code. The set includes fold-out maps, a booklet of essays, and presents a large city through numerous charts and tables. Ten of the twelve full-color fold-out maps fit together to depict a vast maze of streets, alleys, and rooftops, with over 200 numbered-keyed locations. The floor diagrams shown on the maps for some of the more notable locations are filled with schematic icons for tables, fireplaces, beds, trunks, barrels, lumber, and other standard features. Publication history City System was written by Jeff Grubb and Ed Greenwood, with a cover by Larry Elmore, and maps by Dennis Kauth and Frey Graphics. It was published by TSR in 1988 as a boxed set with a 32-page booklet and 12 large color maps. The set includes full-color 22\\" × 34\\" maps. City System is intended to be a companion to Waterdeep and the North. Reception Ken Rolston reviewed City System for Dragon magazine #156 (April 1990). He thought the title misleading, as it is not a system for designing or presenting fantasy role-playing cities: \\"If you're looking for guidance and support in designing and developing your own FRPG city settings, or for a stand-alone FRPG urban adventuring supplement, this is of no use to you.\\" According to Rolston, the fold-out maps are \\"lovely\\" and the booklet with essays is useful, although the essays would have been more appropriately included in Waterdeep and the North, and the charts and tables are \\"of dubious utility\\". Rolston wrote that \\"the Waterdeep urban setting is more sprawling and less cohesive than the Greyhawk setting, and is somewhat less persuasive as a theater for real role-playing action\\". However, the sheer expanse of Waterdeep is \\"impressive, and the 12 full-color fold-out maps in City System are equally impressive\\", although \\"not particularly interesting, useful, or expressive of the setting\\", and \\"the Waterdeep birds-eye view hasn't got very much personality and isn’t so readily cross-referenced to keyed locations\\". Rolston concluded that anyone who owned and enjoyed Waterdeep and the North \\"ought to have this set; it’s not an inspirational model of game design, but the maps are big and colorful, and might be useful for Waterdeep campaigning\\". To those who want to run urban adventures in the Forgotten Realms and must choose between Waterdeep and the North and the more expensive City System, he said: \\"by all means the former is the better deal, and all you really need; City System is only a big, colorful, and unnecessary secondary accessory to Waterdeep and the North\\". Lawrence Schick, in his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, writes that the ten city maps, when combined, \\"can cover an entire wall\\".

Amongst the survivors of the catastrophe, that fateful day became known as the \\"Day of Light.\\" Sometime after the events of the Day of Light, a young man by the name of Weiss, who had lost all memory of himself, encounters an enigmatic woman named Eva, who introduces herself as an Agent of the Divine. It is from her that Weiss learns that he has committed the grievous sin of deicide, and that in order for him to atone for his crime he is to become the \\"Vessel\\" in which the power of the divinity he had slaughtered will be stored. For it will be that power that will be used to resurrect the one whose life he stole. For those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny...

Pine, 'Dawkins of Over Norton' pedigree Originally a larger country estate, it was inherited by John Dawkins (1915-2010), the father of the biologist Richard Dawkins, under whose management it became a single commercial farm which he farmed himself. The estate at Over Norton was bought in 1726 by James Dawkins (c. 1696–1766), the son of Colonel Richard Dawkins of Jamaica, and a Member of Parliament for . He was the uncle of Henry Dawkins the Younger (1728–1814), who inherited the property on his death. A Bodleian Library page comments on the build-up of Dawkins family holdings in the Chipping Norton area, including the purchase of Salford Manor by Henry Dawkins II. Down through the generations, Over Norton belonged to Henry Dawkins (1765–1852) (Henry Dawkins III), third son of Henry Dawkins; then Henry Dawkins (1788–1864) (Henry Dawkins IV), both Members of Parliament for , then to William Gregory Dawkins (1825–1914), passing down to the eldest sons. William Gregory Dawkins replaced the Georgian mansion in 1874. By 1945 a much reduced estate was in the hands of his great-nephew Hereward Dawkins. The passing of Over Norton to another branch of the Dawkins family went back to the line of another son of Henry Dawkins III, Clinton George Augustus Dawkins (1808–1871). He was the great- grandfather of John Dawkins.

It is screened in Melbourne and Tasmania, and across Victoria (weekends only). Like all Nine News bulletins, the Melbourne bulletin runs for one hour, from 6PM every day. It comprises local, national and international news, as well as sport, weather and finance.  History  Peter Hitchener, presenter of Nine News MelbourneThe late Brian Naylor presented National Nine News Melbourne for 20 years from 1978 following his resignation from HSV-7 to 1998. Following his retirement, he was succeeded by Peter Hitchener as weeknight presenter, while Jo Hall took over from Hitchener as weekend presenter. Hall scaled back her work with Nine to news updates and fill-in duties in November 2011, with Weekend Today newsreader Alicia Loxley taking over as weekend presenter. Rob Gell formerly presented the weather until 2003, when he was replaced by Nixon; Gell subsequently defected to the rival Seven News Melbourne bulletin presenting the weather on weekends. In March 2011, the GTV studios moved their base from Bendigo Street, Richmond, to a new building in Bourke Street, Docklands. In May 2017, the station launched its first local afternoon news bulletin, Nine Afternoon News Melbourne, putting it head to head with rival station Seven's local afternoon news. The bulletin is presented by Alicia Loxley (Monday-Wednesday) and Brett McLeod or Dougal Beatty (Thursday & Friday).  Ratings  For many decades, Nine News Melbourne was the most dominant local news service, often drawing a peak audience of more than 400,000 viewers. However, in the mid-2000s, the bulletin started to lose ground to the rival Seven News Melbourne, winning only 24 (out of 40) weeks in 2006 and then narrowly losing in 2007 when it won 19 weeks (to Seven's 20 weeks, with the other week tied). Even during the years when Nine News struggled nationally, the Melbourne bulletin remained competitive, being the only metropolitan bulletin to win any weeks against Seven News in 2008 and 2009. By 2012, however, Nine News Melbourne had re-established its ratings dominance, often leading their rivals by an average margin of over 100,000 viewers.
