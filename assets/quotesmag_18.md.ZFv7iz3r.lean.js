It was very successful; 269 were built in batches, the first starting in 1939 and the last in 1956. Design and development In designing the Pilis, Ern≈ë Rubik was influenced by the arrival in Hungary of a German G√∂ppingen G√∂ 1 advanced trainer, itself a response to the Grunau Baby. The Pilis emerged as a smaller development of his Szittya. The prototype (R-08a) and first production model (R-08b) of the Pilis had gull wings but later versions had wings without dihedral. All were mounted on top of the fuselage and had a single spar with plywood covering forward of it around the leading edge, forming a torsion resistant D-box. An internal drag strut ran from the inboard spar to the fuselage and the area ahead of this spar was also ply covered. The rest of the wing was fabric covered. The inner part of the wing plan was rectangular but the outer panels tapered to rounded tips. Long span ailerons were mounted at an angle to the main spar and had constant chord over most of their length but tapered on reaching the inner part. The first two production variants, like the prototype, had no airbrakes but these were introduced on the R-08d, initially designated R-09, mounted on the rear of the spar between the tapered section and the drag strut. The Pilis's fuselage was a ply semi-monocoque structure with strengthening frames and stringers, roughly oval in section but with sharp junctions above and below. The forward part, with the wing on its top and open cockpit below and immediately ahead of the leading edge, was deepest before tapering to the tail. Overall, the fuselage of the prototype appeared to be slightly curved in profile but correction of control problems in landing flare led to a straightened fuselage, lengthened by , for all production variants. All production models had similar tails, with tapered and round-tipped horizontal surfaces mounted just above the fuselage, to which the tailplane was braced with a single strut on each side. Tailplane and elevators had roughly equal areas. The rudder was full, curved and mounted on a very small fin. The tail of the first prototype, the R-08a was a little different from those of production aircraft, with a taller fin, unbalanced rudder and a noticeably taller tailplane pylon. All Pilis had a standard rubber-sprung landing skid under the forward fuselage. On most this ran from the nose almost to the wing trailing edge but some later R-08ds and B-2s (a new name for R-08ds built in a production run started in 1956) had a shorter skid, which ended below the bottom of the wing strut, with a semi-exposed monowheel just aft of it. The same late series introduced enclosed cockpits; all earlier models had a removable ply cockpit surround, of model-dependent size, fitted with a simple windscreen which left the pilot's head and shoulders exposed but on these late examples the screen was replaced with an enclosing transparency. One B-2, the Gy≈ër 3 Motor-Pilis, was motorized with an Porsche engine mounted in pusher configuration on struts above the wing. It had a fully exposed wheel at the bottom of the wing strut. Though it flew successfully, no more were built.

It is narrated in first person by the son of a man who decides to leave the family and the whole society to live within a small [canoe] in a huge river. Guimar√£es Rosa uses several expressions and culture facts of specific regions of Brazil (which is known as regionalism in the literature), but the tale is however universal, dealing with great dilemmas of human existence. It is written in poetic prose and has sentences that play with specific orality of Brazilian Portuguese.  Criticism and interpretations   Alienation  In a article from February 1966 about the short stories of the book \\"First Stories\\" and the general work of Guimar√£es Rosa, Paulo R√≥nai concludes that \\"The third bank of the river\\" deals with the alienation that is \\"accepted as a painful part of life's routine when it is gradually declared.\\"R√≥nai, 1966, p.22 The narrator of the tale starts to infect himself with the dementia of his father.R√≥nai, 1966, p.26. Orality About orality, R√≥nai observes that the tales of \\"First Stories\\" use idioms that we are accustomed to hear in the mouths of people and that, in their fruity vigor, give delicious flavor and energy to the popular speech. He uses as examples the following sentences extracted from this short story: \\"Nosso pai nada n√£o dizia.\\", \\"Do que eu mesmo me alembro\\", \\"Nossa casa, no tempo, ainda era mais pr√≥xima do rio, obra de nem quarto de l√©gua\\", \\"perto e longe de sua fam√≠lia dele\\", \\"avisado que nem No√©\\".R√≥nai, 1966, p.31-32. Rosa, therefore, would not be a writer who merely reproduces popular language, as he uses neologisms and idioms in a way that, for R√≥nai, is \\"so provocatively original\\".R√≥nai, 1966, p.32..  Neologisms  As stated earlier, Rosa not only portrays a popular and peasant speech, but also invents new words and terms in his texts. On \\"The third bank of the river\\", the neologism \\"diluso\\" is a possible variant of \\"diluto\\" or \\"dilu√≠do\\" (diluted, dissolved).A terceira margem do rio (Conto de Primeiras est√≥rias), de Guimar√£es Rosa.

Her flight, assisted by Atheist Republic and Faith to Faithless, was partially documented in the Vice News documentary Leaving Islam: Rescuing Ex-Muslims (2017). Her 2018 German- language autobiography Frauen d√ºrfen hier nicht tr√§umen ('Women Aren't Allowed to Dream Here'), also translated into French, and became a Spiegel Top-10-best-seller. In 2017, Ahmad founded the Cologne-based Atheist Refugee Relief with the goal of providing 'practical assistance to refugees without religion and to improve their living conditions through political work.'  Biography   Youth  Ahmad's father came from Syria to work as a construction manager in Saudi Arabia in the mid-1970s. Four years later, he married Ahmad's mother in Syria and took her to Riyadh. Ahmad was born there in 1985 and has an older and a younger brother and an older sister. Her family was deeply religious, in her words 'an extremist family compared to other families in our society', and that she and her siblings were taught the Quran from the age of 4. Ahmad went to a state girl's school, where more than a quarter of all education was dedicated to religion. She was taught that all non-Muslims would go to hell, and that hating Christians and Jews was a religious duty. She was allowed to cycle around on her bike, for example to buy groceries, when the family was on holiday at her father's parents in Syria. But at the age of 10, her grandfather took her bike away, saying she was 'too old for that now', which she felt robbed her of her most important freedom. Amhad did not understand why it should be considered haram if \\"big girls\\" like her ride a bike, but not if boys do the same. The very next day, also from the age of 10, Ahmad was compelled to wear an abaya and a black hijab. Although Saudi law does not require women to wear headgear that is more restrictive than the hijab, at age 13 Ahmad was compelled by her family and her school to wear an even more face-covering niqab, which only left her eyes uncovered. Although she didn't understand the religious rules that were subsequently imposed upon her, she accepted and complied. She had never had any contact with a boy or man that was not related to her until she reached adulthood.  Higher education and online exploration  At the age of 19, Ahmad was to be married off, and an engagement party took place in Syria, but because her would-be husband refused to move to Saudi Arabia and she refused to move to Syria, the plans did not materialise. Meanwhile, her husband turned abusive and prompted her to seek a divorce and move back in with her parents, which stained her reputation in society. She rejected three more marriage proposals by Saudi men in subsequent years, arguing she wanted to advance her education first. Ahmad attended vocational school courses in English and EDP, then worked as a receptionist and office worker in various medical practices and hospitals. Due to the Saudi male guardianship system, however, she could barely leave the house and if she wanted to travel by car, her male relatives had to drive her; she wasn't allowed to travel alone. However, the restrictions and obligations of being a married woman made her question her role, her religion and evolved into a desire for freedom. In search for answers to her questions, she turned to the internet, discovering philosophy (which Ahmad says is banned in Saudi Arabia) and atheism at the age of 25. This happened in 2011, when she ran into a tweet from someone using the Twitter handle \\"Arab Atheist\\", which she had to Google Translate to understand. Shocked, Ahmad contacted \\"Arab Atheist\\", who recommended her multiple documentaries (for example, on the theory of evolution and the Big Bang) and books from Richard Dawkins, Friedrich Nietzsche, Voltaire and Charles Darwin translated to Arabic. \\"I cried when I discovered all the things I was never taught, what they withheld from me,\\" Ahmad said in a 2016 interview. After about a year, she concluded she could no longer believe, because of all the contradictions in the Quran. It caused her even greater fear and sorrow to realise that atheism and apostasy in Saudi Arabia were punishable by death, and she probably had to leave the country and everything she had behind, in order to survive. She hid her changing views from her family and continued praying five times a day, while she searched for help online from various groups such as Faith to Faithless, Ex-Muslims of North America and Atheist Republic. For five years, she lived as a closeted atheist in Saudi Arabia, terrified that her family would kill her or the state would execute her if her nonbelief were discovered.  Family troubles  Rana held this Atheist Republic paper in the Great Mosque of Mecca. Ahmad's older brother began to suspect she was secretly seeing men, and placed a covert listening device in her room. Catching her calling with a male friend, he stormed her room and tried to kill her, but their father heard her screams for help and intervened. After this incident, Ahmad tried to commit suicide by cutting her wrists, but again her father found her in time to take her to the hospital and save her life. Ahmad got a new job as secretary at a school for mentally disabled children. Meanwhile, she took on English studies. When her mother discovered Ahmad's tweets about religious doubts, she was furious and put Ahmad under house arrest for a month without access to her laptop or smartphone. Her mother forced her to pray and recite the Quran. In 2014, she was forced by her family to participate in the hajj. She sought and found the help of Atheist Republic as well as other similar organisations online. While on hajj, she took a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with \\"Atheist Republic\\" written on it, while standing inside the Great Mosque of Mecca facing the Kaaba, the holiest site of Islam. She was extremely frightened because she knew she would be killed if the people around her saw the paper and discovered her nonbelief, but she wanted to tell the internet that she existed as an atheist in Mecca and, like many nonbelievers in Saudi Arabia, was not here by her own choice. It was also the first time she decided she had to leave the country quickly, or otherwise end her life. She requested Atheist Republic to upload the photo to Facebook after she left Mecca, and they did so on 3 August 2014; a few days later she was overwhelmed to find it had gone viral.  Flight  The 2016 Vice News film Rescuing Ex-Muslims: Leaving Islam documents Rana Ahmad's flight to Germany. Ahmad made plans to escape the country, aided by Faith to Faithless. At first, Ahmad sought to flee to the Netherlands, but the embassy refused to grant her a visa. Thereafter she thought of marrying a like-minded man to leave the country with, but found no candidate. Because her Syrian passport would be outdated by the end of 2015 and the Syrian embassy in Saudi Arabia was closed (since 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War), Ahmad had to hurry and could only flee to a country without a visa requirement, such as Turkey. As a foreign woman from Syria, her employer rather than her father had to grant her permission to travel abroad, and she was able to convince him that she was going on a family holiday so he signed the papers for her. On 26 May 2015, she took an aeroplane from Riyadh via Dubai to Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport, only taking her laptop, documents (including her Syrian passport) and 200 American dollars. She took off her hijab and abaya upon arrival for the first time as an adult in public, and henceforth adopted her pseudonym 'Rana Ahmad (Hamd)' to frustrate attempts by her family to track her down. After four days she took the bus to a friend (another ex-Muslim from Syria) in Izmir, who offered her a small house for rent. For the first time in her life, Ahmad danced in the street and drank alcohol. However, she received word that her family discovered she had escaped to Turkey and feared they were going to come after her. She cut her hair short, dyed it blonde and put on colourful contact lenses as a disguise. Next, Armin Navabi, the founder of Atheist Republic, started a crowdfunding campaign for her to finance her stay and further journey into the European Union, which raised $5000. In August 2015, Imtiaz Shams from Faith to Faithless, joined by a camera crew of Vice News, came to visit her in Izmir to discuss solutions. After vainly trying to obtain a visa to enter the EU for five months, Ahmad decided to cross the border with Greece illegally by boat, which succeeded on the third attempt. From Greece, she travelled across North Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, reaching Germany in November 2015. Along the way, she stayed in various refugee camps for some time. She cancelled plans to continue to Sweden because she was out of money, tired of travelling and had heard Germany's education system was good.  Life in Germany  Upon arrival in Germany in November 2015, Ahmad spent a year in a refugee camp located about an hour from Cologne, before she was assigned her own house. On 31 December 2015, the Vice News camera crew visited her again in Cologne. She spent much of her first year reading (physics) books, intending to study nuclear physics or nuclear engineering. She felt threatened by Muslim refugees in the camp, however, many of whom thought of apostasy as a deadly crime. By chance, she discovered by writing to Maryam Namazie that the Central Council of Ex-Muslims was coincidentally headquartered in Cologne as well, and after contacting Mina Ahadi, the Council and the Giordano Bruno Foundation were able to help her find a house for herself. At the age of 30, after 20 years, she was finally able to buy and ride a bike again in Germany, which she regarded as an important restoration of her freedom. A photo of her holding her new bike in Cologne was used for an Atheist Refugee Relief brochure. She stated in March 2018 that \\"I love Germany, I love my free life in Germany.\\" She wanted to adapt quickly, obtain German citizenship, improve her German language skills and support the activities of the Central Council of Ex-Muslims. Since late 2018, Ahmad has been studying physics in Cologne.  Activism in Germany  Maryam Namazie interviews Rana Ahmad in Cologne, 2017. In subsequent years, Ahmad has given many interviews to several media, primarily German and French ones, about her experiences and her political and religious opinions, especially with regards to the politics of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after dissident Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated in October 2018. Ahmad commented that Saudi authorities have failed to stimulate the emancipation of women that many activists have campaigned for, often imprisoning them, and thereby sending women the message they have no future in Saudi Arabia and pushing them to flee the country. The Vice News documentary Leaving Islam: Rescuing Ex-Muslims featuring part of Ahmad's life journey from Saudi Arabia to Germany was broadcast on 10 February 2016. On 5 March 2016, three months after arriving in Germany, Ahmad held her first public speech in Cologne at a meeting organised by the Central Council of Ex-Muslims. She spoke in Arabic about her life in Saudi Arabia, her flight and her opinion on how Western countries should treat refugees such as herself, with Lebanese‚ÄìGerman television journalist Imad Karim providing the German translation. Ahmad gave her first major interview to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in June 2016. At the time, she was still in a refugee camp waiting to be assigned her own house, and feeling threatened by Muslim refugees in that camp. \\"I don't hate Muslims, I've also got good Muslim friends who accept me how I am. What I hate is when rights are taken away in the name of religion, especially from women,\\" she said. Although she has no problem with people who hold Islamic beliefs, it has made her angry seeing a 6- or 8-year-old girl being forced to wear the veil in Germany, where German law rather than sharia applies. It also upsets her that some Muslims don't accept Jews. Ahmad in conversation in De Balie during Celebrating Dissent 2019. On 15 August 2016, Ahmad was interviewed on television for the first time by journalist Jaafar Abdul Karim from Deutsche Welle in Arabic, excerpts of which were translated to English and other languages. Three million people saw her on television declaring she had left Islam, and excerpts from it went viral on the Internet, resulting in Muslims from around the world sending her numerous threats and insults. With the help of the Central Council of Ex-Muslims and the Giordano Bruno Foundation, Ahmad founded the Atheist Refugee Relief in March 2017, and officially presented at the 10th anniversary of the Council on 17 November 2017. Its goal is 'to support refugees who are discriminated against or even threatened with their very lives because of their atheistic conviction or their critical attitude towards religion.' The Relief's volunteers are working on a daily basis to protect especially female atheist refugees ‚Äì as they are targeted more frequently and viciously ‚Äì from further persecution (for example, 'assaults, exclusion, threats and violence') in Germany. As of December 2018, it has helped 37 recognised nonreligious refugees since November 2017, but the demand was rising quickly. According to Dittmar Steiner, the Atheist Refugee Relief received 'two to three requests [for help] a week' when it started, which had increased to 'between seven and nine a day' a year later. On 15 January 2018, her book Frauen d√ºrfen hier nicht tr√§umen: Mein Ausbruch aus Saudi-Arabien, mein Weg in die Freiheit ('Women Aren't Allowed to Dream Here: My Escape from Saudi Arabia and My Path to Freedom') was published in Germany and became a Spiegel Top-10-best-seller. A French translation was published in Paris in October 2018 under the name Ici, les femmes ne r√™vent pas : R√©cit d'une √©vasion ('Here, Women Do Not Dream: Story of an Escape'). According to Ahmad, \\"We, women, we can change our lives, be free. We think we are weak, but that is wrong; we are strong, and this book proves it.\\"  Book  *German original: *French translation:  See also  * Atheist Refugee Relief * Rahaf Mohammed * Dina Ali Lasloom * Worood Zuhair Notes  References   External links  *Atheist Refugee Relief ‚Äì Official website Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Articles containing video clips Category:German atheism activists Category:Former Muslim critics of Islam Category:Former Muslims turned agnostics or atheists Category:Syrian atheists Category:Syrian emigrants to Germany Category:Syrian feminists Category:Syrian former Muslims Category:Syrian people Category:Syrian refugees Category:21st- century atheists Category:21st-century Syrian women writers Category:Opposition to Islam in Germany Category:People from Damascus ","title":"Rana Ahmad"},{"id":"60025772","text":"Sanguibacteroides is a genus from the family of Porphyromonadaceae with one known species (Sanguibacteroides justesenii).<ref name='Sanguibacteroides/> References Category:Bacteroidetes Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Sanguibacteroides"},{"id":"60025802","text":"The Banks Peninsula Volcano is an extinct volcanic complex to the east of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island.Sewell 1986 While the volcano is highly eroded it still forms the majority of Banks Peninsula with a highest point of . It is a composite of two main eruptive centers one originating at Lyttelton Harbour, the other at Akaroa Harbour. The eruptions were predominantly basaltic, with associated andesite and trachytes, with minor rhyolite. The volcanic activity occurred in the Late Miocene and possibly extended into the Early Pliocene. There are four volcanic groups, all of which are within the MƒÅui Supergroup.Mortimer et al. 2014 The Christchurch earthquakes led to rumors of a possible eruption, however, there is no known magma chamber beneath the volcano and there has not been any sign of volcanic activity in the last 5 million years.  Origin and relationship to other volcanoes  New Zealand's South Island has many extinct volcanic centers with no obvious tectonic mechanism of formation.Timm 2009Hoernle 2006 et al. Because of this the cause of these intraplate volcanoes is debated. They extend in age from the Cretaceous to the Pliocene and outcrop throughout Otago, Canterbury and on the Chatham Islands.Hoernle 2006 et al. The largest of these is the Banks Peninsula Volcano followed by the Dunedin Volcano which is half its size. Also the Cretaceous Mount Somers Volcanics occur throughout Canterbury including Banks Peninsula.Hoernle 2006 et al. These volcanic centers can be dormant for tens of millions of years between eruptions. This implies that the mechanism of formation is connected to the lithosphere unlike some other intraplate volcanoes such as the Hawaii island chain, which are rooted in the asthenosphere. One mechanism for the creation of these volcanoes is the flaking off of the base of Zealandia's lower lithosphere into the asthenosphere. Zealandia has a thin lithosphere as it has been extended while rafting away from Australia. If large sections of this already thin lithosphere sank into the asthenosphere, it would be replaced with hotter rock leading to decompression melting. This theoretically could cause volcanic activity that is locked to the moving lithosphere over many millions of years.Hoernle 2006 et al.  Geomorphology and structure  The shape of the volcano was controlled by a north-west south-east fault system that controlled magma flow.Ring 2012 Local extension formed the Lyttelton Volcanic Complex. Erosion has formed streams radially around the volcanic cones and more significant valleys have formed where these radial patterns meet.Hampton 2010 The erosion and destruction of one wall of these cones has led to an increase in catchment size and associated erosion. Therefore, forming the significant natural harbours of Banks Peninsula. By this mechanism Lyttelton Harbour had started for form by 8.1 Ma.Hampton 2010 The large mass of resistant volcanic rock that now makes up Banks Peninsula has significantly controlled the shape of the Canterbury Plains.Ballance 2009 p.252 Volcanic subunits Volcanic activity started at Lyttelton Harbour (c.11 Ma)Forsyth 2008 p.29 then extended through the Mount Herbert Volcanic Group to Akaroa Harbour (c.9 Ma).Forsyth 2008 p.29 During the latter phase of the volcano it was simultaneous active from both its major magma chambers, at Akaroa and Lyttelton. The complex geochemically evolved over time and has cyclic eruptive phases. Each packed has an increase feldspar with time, which created more blocky lava flows due to increased viscosity.Hampton 2010  Lyttelton Volcanic Group  alt=The oldest eruptions of the Banks Peninsula occurred between 11‚Äì9.7 Ma around the modern town of Lyttelton.

To the West of the fault Paleozoic basement rocks are interluded by plutones and both are unconformably covered in a sedimentary sequence. To the East of the Alpine Fault are the Mesozoic Alpine Schist and Greywacke of the Southern Alps. There are numerous active faults throughout the region.Nathan et al., 2002, p.V Geomorphology and tectonics Elevation map of the west coast of New Zealand's South Island showing the sharp line formed by the Alpine Fault.

The Southern Alps gets progressively further from the coast, from the south of the Region where the mountains meet the sea, to the north where several other rangers of mountains are between the Southern Alps and the coast. In the central section there is typically a plain between the Alps and the sea which is broken by glacial moraines and isolated hills, made of more resistant granite.Nathan et al., 2002, p. 3‚Äì9 The uplift of the Southern Alps on the Alpine Fault has led to greater precipitation in the West Coast Region. This has increased erosion which has isostatically increased uplift. This uplift is greatest in the centre of the fault where New Zealand's highest mountain, Mt Cook, is found.

The terrane is composed of the Golden Bay, Greenland and Reefton groups. The Greenland Group has been metamorphosed to form the Pecksniff Metasedimentary Gneiss. The common name for these is the 'Charleston Gneiss' and it was thought for most of the 20th century that these were the oldest rocks in the country.

These intrusions have two distinct age ranges, Late Devonian to Carboniferous and Early Cretaceous.Nathan et al., 2002, p.11  Basement terranes east of the Alpine Fault  Alpine Schist  The Alpine Schist gets progressively higher grade as it approaches the Alpine Fault from the east. Near the Alpine Fault Granite pegmatites and mylonites are present. Alpine Schist, Fox Glacier, New Zealand  Other Eastern Province terranes  In the far South of the West Coast Region, South of Jackson Bay, a number of other basement terranes are present. From West to East these are the Drumduan, Brook Street, Murihiku, Dun Mountain-Maitai, Caples, Aspiring terranes. Near the Alpine Fault these terranes are overprinted by the Alpine Schist.  Cover sequence  East of the Alpine Fault almost all the cover sequence has been eroded due to the high uplift rate. West of the Alpine Fault is a sedimentary sequence representing a marine regression. Terrestrial breccia and coal measures (Cretaceous to Eocene) Hawks Crag Breccia, Hawks Crag, Buller River Unconformably overlying the basement rocks west of the Alpine Fault is a terrestrial sequence that represents Zealandia's progressive movement away from Gondwana. The Hawks Crag Breccia formed from erosion off fault scarps. It is also New Zealand's best source of Uranium. These are then overlain by coal measures formed in swamps from the continued extension. These include both the Paparoa and Brunner Coal Measures, which are being extensively mined.  Marine sediments (Oligocene to Miocene) Oparara Arch. Karamea Suite granite at the base and a limestone roof.|alt= As extension and subsidence continued the West Coast Region was covered with marine sediments in the Oligocene. These included limestone and calcareous mudstones. By the early Miocene the Alpine Fault had become active and a small degree of uplift lead to the formation of some coal measures.Nathan et al., 2002, p.29 Alluvium (Quaternary) From the continued uplift of the Southern Alps and it's erosion a thick sequence of alluvium was created forming the plains of the West Coast. These are also associated with a series of glacial sediments.Nathan et al., 2002, p.31 Economic Geology The West Coast has both hard rock and alluvial gold. Significant coal deposits are found in the north of region. Jade is found in the central region from the Alpine Schist and in the South of the Region from the Dun Mountain-Maitai Terrane. Natural Hazards The Alpine Fault represents the most significant risk on the West Coast and has a 30% chance of generating a magnitude 8 earthquake in the next 50 years.Nathan et al., 2002, p.46-47 Tourism The glaciers that have formed near sea level due to the high precipitation and the Pancake rocks and Oparara Archers are erosional Karst features that have become tourist attractions.

The SCJN further removed the requirement for individuals to obtain an amparo (injunction) for same-sex marriage in the state. Corte invalida art√≠culos que imped√≠an el matrimonio igualitario en Nuevo Le√≥n By statute, in Mexico, if any five rulings from the courts on a single issue result in the same outcome, legislatures are bound to change the law. In the case of Nuevo Le√≥n, almost 20 individual injunctions were decided with the same outcome, yet the state did not act. In February 2019, the SCJN issued a definitive ruling in an action of unconstitutionality, declaring the state's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional, void and unenforceable. The ruling came into effect on 31 May upon publication in the Official Gazette of the Federation. History Legislative action On 17 June 2015, the New Alliance Party announced their intention to introduce a same-sex marriage bill. An independent congressman announced his intention to submit his own civil union proposal with the support of the ruling PAN. On 22 June 2015, New Alliance member and Congress President, Mar√≠a Dolores Leal Cant√∫, presented the same-sex marriage bill. On 16 May 2016, the president of the Legislative Commission of the State Congress announced that the bill would be voted on sometime in September, but this did not happen. In November 2017, the state's PAN leader announced that the Nuevo Le√≥n Congress would not discuss the same- sex marriage bill. His statement came after LGBT groups organized a protest in favor of same-sex marriage in front of the Congress building. El l√≠der del PAN en el Congreso de Nuevo Le√≥n, Arturo Salinas, asegura que no hay iniciativa para discutir el matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo Injunctions Despite same-sex marriage not being legal at the time, several same-sex couples were able to legally marry in individual cases, through a process called recurso de amparo. In September 2013, a federal judge ordered the Civil Registry of Nuevo Le√≥n to register the marriage of a female same-sex couple. Governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz said his administration would abide by the order, but only for that specific case. On 13 November 2013, a male same-sex couple went to the Civil Registry office in San Pedro Garza Garc√≠a and made an application for a marriage license. They were told to expect a response within one week. In December 2013, they filed a complaint with the help of the against the Registry for failure to provide them with an official response. In June 2014, it was reported that nine injunctions had been filed in the state, but only one had been resolved. By October 2018, 17 amparos had been granted in the state. The State Constitutional Court held a hearing on 12 September 2014 to rule on an amparo filed by 50 people claiming that Articles 147 and 291 of the Civil Code were discriminatory for banning same-sex marriage. On 16 October 2014, the Supreme Court declared the two articles unconstitutional and granted an injunction to the plaintiffs. In March 2015, it was confirmed that an amparo for 35 couples was pending in Nuevo Le√≥n. On 17 February 2016, the First Chamber of the Supreme Court ordered the Governor of Nuevo Le√≥n, Jaime Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n, to recognize cohabitation between same-sex couples. In September 2016, the First Chamber of the Supreme Court declared various articles in the state's Civil Code unconstitutional for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. SCJN avala matrimonios gay en Nuevo Le√≥n, Hidalgo y Chiapas On 19 October 2017, the First Chamber of the Supreme Court declared Article 147 of the Civil Code of Nuevo Le√≥n unconstitutional for discriminating against same-sex couples. Ganan 118 personas amparo para matrimonio gay en NL On 9 October 2018, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that Nuevo Le√≥n's Civil Code was unconstitutional and discriminatory because it limited marriage to different-sex couples. The court ordered the state Congress to change its Civil Code within 180 business days (i.e. 16 April 2019). However, in February 2019 prior to that deadline, the Supreme Court ruled in an action of unconstitutionality against the state (see below), legalizing same-sex marriage. En desacato, Congreso de Nuevo Le√≥n, sino aprueba en 90 d√≠as, Matrimonio Igualitario Action of unconstitutionality An action of unconstitutionality against Nuevo Le√≥n's same-sex marriage ban was filed in February 2018. Corte admite recurso contra matrimonio entre mujer y hombre en NL Corte admite recurso contra matrimonio entre mujer y hombre en NL Actions of unconstitutionality are different from the recurso de amparo process mentioned above, as the Supreme Court can directly and completely strike down a state law. The amparo process, on the other hand, requires the state legislatures to act and change the law. As such, many legislatures have chosen to intentionally delay or simply ignore these amparo rulings. Another difference is that actions of unconstitutionality can only be filed within 30 days after the law in question has gone into effect. In this case, the Congress of Nuevo Le√≥n modified its marriage laws, but left intact provisions outlawing same-sex marriages. This qualified for an action of unconstitutionality, which LGBT groups quickly filed. On 19 February 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that articles 140 and 148 of the Civil Code were unconstitutional for banning same-sex marriage, legalizing such marriages in the state of Nuevo Le√≥n. Suprema Corte declara inconstitucional negar matrimonio gay en Nuevo Le√≥n Corte ordena legalizar bodas gay en Nuevo Le√≥n Governor Jaime Rodr√≠guez Calder√≥n expressed his opposition to the ruling, El Bronco en desacuerdo por legalizaci√≥n del matrimonio igualitario en Nuevo Le√≥n and religious groups opposed to same-sex marriage asked Calder√≥n to override or ignore the ruling, however, he does not have the power to do so. Congress was officially notified of the ruling on 26 February. The ruling officially came into force on 31 May 2019 upon publication in the Official Gazette of the Federation (). In the meantime, the Civil Registry began allowing same-sex couples to marry without the need for an injunction. The first couple, Janeth Oliva and Amatz√∫ Aranda, married on 11 March 2019 in San Nicol√°s de los Garza. The Supreme Court ruling also struck down the state's same-sex adoption ban.ACCI√ìN DE INCONSTITUCIONALIDAD 29/2018 Public opinion A 2017 opinion poll conducted by found that 48% of Nuevo Le√≥n residents supported same-sex marriage. 49% were opposed.

The series was originally published in 2016 as a web novel by the author on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh≈çsetsuka ni Nar≈ç. Later on the same year, it was acquired and then published by Kadokawa Shoten. It has been licensed in English by Yen Press. The light novels follow its titular protagonist who, after being crushed to death by a vending machine, is reincarnated as a sentient vending machine in a fantasy dungeon world. Shortly after, he meets and befriends Lammis, a young female hunter, who names him \\"Boxxo\\" and starts carrying him around on her back, and the two start their adventures in the dungeon together. Reborn as a Vending Machine has received positive reception from reviewers, with particular praise being directed at the novels' unique take on the isekai genre.  Synopsis  The then-unnamed protagonist, a Japanese vending machine otaku, is crushed to death by a falling vending machine. He then finds himself reincarnated in a fantasy world dungeon as a sentient vending machine. He can see and hear but is immobile, with his speech being limited to stock Japanese vending machine phrases, such as \\"Welcome\\" or \\"Too bad\\". As a vending machine, he discovers he can dispense any item he has bought in his previous life, and can convert such sales to points thus sustaining his existence. He is also able to use excess coins to add additional features to his vending machine body, and is able to choose which items he stocks or the prices of the items. He is also able to use some magical abilities, including a defensive force field. Stuck in the middle of the wilderness, he encounters Lammis, a young, busty hunter girl. Lammis has a skill known as the Blessing of Might which makes her ridiculously strong, but is still a novice at managing her own strength. The two quickly become friends after he dispenses some food items to the hungry Lammis. Calling him \\"Boxxo\\" (the protagonist's real name is never revealed), she starts carrying him around on her back, which allows Boxxo to move, with his weight allowing her to more easily control her strength. The light novels chronicles their adventures as they start exploring the world's dungeon, and the characters they meet on the way.  Background  In the afterword of the first volume, Hirukuma describes his envisioning and road to publishing Reborn as a Vending Machine. He at first helped out with his father's independent business, though, after the death of his father from a high fall, he closed down the business and began pursuing his ambition as a writer. He described his father's death as giving him acrophobia, and recalled thinking \\"I don't know when I'm going to die like my father did. One question went through my mind: Have I done everything I've wanted to in life?\\" On a site titled Let's Become Novelists, a site for submitting novels, he submitted several works of fiction including another isekai piece and a battle-themed novel set in the near future, but was initially unsuccessful. He described Reborn as a Vending Machine as his final effort after four years of unsuccessfully getting his novels published. Hirukuma wrote that \\"[it was] one that was fantastical and original, and one that I wanted to write [...] This wasn't a novel where I adjusted for the readers' needs, or had to think long and hard about constructing a plot. Instead, I pursued my own style for it, and it garnered the most popularity of all my work\\".  Characters  ; :The titular protagonist of the light novels, Boxxo was reincarnated as a vending machine in a fantasy world after being crushed by a falling vending machine in Japan. As a vending machine, Boxxo can only communicate in stock vending machine phrases and cannot move by himself, but is able to sell and dispense items, which then rewards with him with points he can then use to upgrade himself. ; :Lammis is a young, energetic Hunter with the skill Blessing of Might, which makes her incredibly strong, though she is clumsy at controlling her own strength. Lammis is Boxxo's primary love interest. ; :A childhood friend of Lammis, who behaves more like an older sister towards her, Hulemy is a talented magical item engineer and has a tomboyish personality. ; :A (literal) bear who is the director of the Hunter's Association on the Clearflow Lake strata of the dungeon (where the series is primarily set). ; :A cordial, beautiful woman who runs a \\"business of the night\\" on the Clearflow Lake strata. ; :The daughter of a rich tycoon, Suori is selfish and strong-willed yet has taken an interest in Boxxo.  Volume list  Originally Hirukuma published the series online as a web novel on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh≈çsetsuka ni Nar≈ç in March 2016, until Kadokawa Shoten acquired the series to publish it as a light novel. The first volume was published by Kadokawa Shoten on August 1, 2016. Yen Press announced during the Anime Expo 2017 that they had licensed the series for an English release.  Reception  Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon has received positive reception. Theron Martin of Anime News Network reviewed the first volume positively, praising its unique take on the isekai genre, Hirukuma's writing style, and the relationship between Boxxo and Lammis, which he found to be impressive and not having to \\"resort to hackneyed gimmicks\\". Summarising that \\"this novel's bizarre concept is what will catch people's attention, but the writing is good enough to keep it\\", some criticism was directed at the light novel's fanservice, which Martin found to be forced, and the RPG elements typical of isekai series. Similarly, Robert Frazer of UK Anime Network found Reborn as a Vending Machine to be \\"a blast of fresh air to flush out the stale isekai genre\\", as \\"it‚Äôs fun and different to defeat the villain with Diet Coke and Mentos instead of just firing a Saiyan blast at a higher powerlevel\\". Rebecca Silverman and Lynzee Loveridge, in Anime News Network's Spring 2018 Light Novel Guide, also praised the setting but found the writing to \\"read like fan-fiction-level quality\\". They ultimately found the volume to \\"still [be] an engaging read\\", and compared it to So I'm a Spider, So What? and That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Loveridge further included the protagonist's \\"Death By Vending Machine\\" on her list of the \\"7 Strangest Isekai Deaths\\".

The series follows Keiki Kiry≈´, a high school student who seeks the identity of the sender of an unnamed love letter attached to an underwear, which consequently leads him to discover the special hidden peculiarities of the girls in his life. Hensuki began publication by Media Factory under their MF Bunko J imprint, with the first volume released on January 25, 2017. A total of eleven volumes have published as of September 2020. A manga adaptation with illustration by CHuN has been serialized via Fujimi Shobo's sh≈çnen manga magazine Monthly Dragon Age since November 2017. It has been collected in five tank≈çbon volumes as of April 2020. A drama CD was released on May 25, 2018. A 12-episode anime television series adaptation by Geek Toys aired from July 8 to September 23, 2019. The series is licensed in North America by Funimation, and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment. Premise Hensuki revolves around Keiki Kiry≈´, an ordinary high school student who finds an anonymous love letter addressed to him. What makes things even more interesting is that attached to the letter, there's a pair of panties. To determine the identity of his secret admirer, referred to as \\"Cinderella\\", Keiki proceeds to investigate several possible candidates, including his senior and president of the calligraphy club Sayuki Tokihara; his underclassman and assistant librarian Yuika Koga; and his classmate and close friend Mao Nanj≈ç. However, as Keiki seeks to uncover who this mysterious girl might be, he discovers that every girl he suspects is singularly perverted and desperately interested in getting him to participate in their perversion. Characters Main ; : : Keiki is a second-year high school student, library helper and member of the calligraphy club. After cleaning up the club room he found a love letter left for him along with a pair of panties, and is now trying to track down the \\"Cinderella\\" who left these items for him. ; : : Sayuki is a third-year student and president of the calligraphy club. She is a hardcore masochist who longs to be Keiki's \\"pet\\". She repeatedly uses hidden cameras to gain material with which to blackmail him into satisfying her fetish. She's known about Yuika's fetish from the first time they met and immediately became fierce rivals, constantly fighting for his attention. She is called \\"Witch\\" by Yuika. ; : : Yuika is a first-year student and assistant librarian with Keiki. She is one-quarter Caucasian, has blonde hair and blue eyes, and is initially shy and stand-offish, but warms up to Keiki's persistent attempts to get to know her. She's secretly a sadist who wishes to make Keiki her slave. She found out about Sayuki's fetish the first time they met and has been fighting to \\"protect\\" Keiki from the \\"Witch's\\" clutches. ; : : Keiki's classmate and dear friend. She frequently hangs out with him and Shoma. She's secretly a fujoshi who constantly fantasizes about Keiki and Shoma in homoerotic situations, which she writes and illustrates in a published series. She begs Keiki to become an actual couple with Shoma to help fuel her fantasies and aid her in her work. ; : : Keiki's younger sister, who is very close to her brother and frequently \\"flirts\\" with him as Keiki puts it, ranging from pampering him and seeking to have him pamper her to sneaking into bed with him claiming suspicion he'd finally awaken as a siscon. It is later revealed that she is the \\"Cinderella\\" who left the love letter and her panties for Keiki, and that she was adopted after the death of her parents and thus non-blood related. In fifth grade, she once forgot to bring panties to change into after swim class and had to spend the entire day that way, which she found liberating. Afterwards, Mizuha developed an exhibitionist tendency, often going to school without panties and secretly taking strip tease selfies in order to experience this feeling of liberation. This habit is also the reason why her panties were left behind with her love letter. ; : : Keiki's best friend. Though popular he's a confirmed lolicon. He regularly acts as a confidant for Keiki, helping him to figure out who the \\"Cinderella\\" may have been. Supporting ; : : Koharu is a third-year from the Astronomy club. She's a stalker who engages in constant voyeurism. She is extremely tiny, resembling a small child. She's in love with Keiki's lolicon friend Shoma, but worries that despite her \\"loli\\" appearance he'd still refuse to date her on account of her being older than him. She thus uses secretly- taken photos to try and blackmail Keiki into helping her. ; : : Ayano is a second-year student, and vice-president of the student council. She engages in olfactophilia, and though she does sniff around the boy's locker room, she became especially attracted to Keiki's smell and frequently ask for his underwear. ; : Shiho is a third-year student, and the president of the student council. Since Keiki frequently helped the student councils, they became acquainted. She enjoys playing video games. When the Calligraphy club misused club funding, she used her power to make Keiki a temporary student council member as one of the condition to forgive the club's debt. She expressed interest in Keiki specific due to his popularity with girls, as she has a strong netorare fetish, and gets excited for seeing the love of her life being stolen (or poached in the case of Keiki). ; : Airi is a first-year student and the treasurer of the student council. Because of a traumatic experience in her past, which turned in fear, Airi is very cold towards men. She is said to be a tsundere because of her difference in treatment between men and women. It is revealed later that she likes and writes yuri novels, which often make Keiki wonder if she is homosexual. ; : Rin, nicknamed , is a first-year student and the secretary of the student council. Although Rin usually looks like a boy, he cross-dresses as a girl when working with the student council. ; : Megumi is a second-year student and candidate for the next president of the student council. After losing the election to Ayano, Megumi becomes vice-president instead. Others ; : : Okita is a teacher at Momosawa High School and the calligraphy club advisor. ; : Y≈´hi is Sh≈çma's older sister, as well as Asahi's twin sister. ; : Asahi is Sh≈çma's older sister, as well as Y≈´hi's twin sister. ; : Naoya is a third-year student and childhood friend of Megumi. ; : Mifuyu is the mother of Sayuki Tokihara. She is not only aware of Sayuki's masochist fetish, but also seems to be just as pervert as she is, having the habit of peeking under girls' skirts and picking up their panties to collect.

The reserve covers habitats at a range of different altitudes, ranging from Caledonian Forest beside the River Feshie in the west, via bog and open moorland, to an arctic- alpine environment on the Cairngorm plateau. The Munro summit of Sg√≤r Gaoith (1118 m) lies on the eastern boundary of the reserve. The forested areas of the reserve form part of an expanse of Caledonian pinewood that stretches from Glen Feshie to Abernethy, and which as a whole forms the largest single area of this habitat remaining in Scotland.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 1. The reserve is owned and managed jointly by NatureScot and Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS): NatureScot own the Invereshie portion of the reserve and FLS the Inshriach area.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 29. There are no waymarked trails at the reserve; however, several paths do run through it, starting from Coire Ruadh or Achlean in Glen Feshie. The paths through the reserve are regularly used by hillwalkers to access the summit of Sg√≤r Gaoith. Flora and fauna Probably the most significant habitat at the reserve is the Caledonian Forest, which covers the landscape between about 250-630 m above sea level.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 7. Invereshie is often considered to be one of the best examples of this habitat, with the montane scrub zone at Creag Fhiaclach being perhaps the only example of a truly natural tree line in Scotland. The forest consists chiefly of Scots pine, with scattered examples of rowan, birch, aspen, alder, juniper and holly. Some areas of Inshriach were planted with non-native species for commercial reasons, however these trees have largely been removed, and these areas are now developing into a semi-natural pineforest. The forest floor hosts a wide array of plants, including heather, blaeberry and cowberry, and many species of mosses, lichens and fungi. There are also areas of bog woodland, where wet conditions inhibit tree growth. Here, plant species like cross-leaved heath, cotton grass and various species of sphagnum moss thrive. At the upper edge of Invereshie the climate causes pines and juniper to grow into twisted, stunted forms known as krummholz. Above the krummholz the landscape is more open, and consists of wet and dry heaths and blanket bog. These open mountain habitats host plants that are specially adapted to harsh conditions, with species such as twinflower, cloudberry, bladderwort, yellow saxifrage, alpine lady‚Äôs mantle, trailing azalea and purple saxifrage all present.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p.p. 7-11.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 15. Wood ants form an important part of the ecosystem of the Caledonian Forest, which also supports a wide range of other invertebrate life. Many of the species found here are otherwise scarce in Britain, with the green hairstreak butterfly being one example. The large heath, dingy skipper and pearl-bordered fritillary have also been found at Invereshie and Inshriach. Other rare invertebrates include Chamaesyrphus scaevoides (a hoverfly) and Hybomitra lurida (a horsefly). The bog woodlands attract dragonflies and damselflies, including the northern damselfly (Scotland‚Äôs rarest damselfly), the northern emerald and the white- faced darter. On the mountain plateau the black mountain moth has been found.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 14. The woodland is home to many species of bird which are otherwise rare or uncommon, such as Scottish crossbill (Scotland's only endemic bird species), crested tit, capercaillie and black grouse. The forested parts of Invereshie and Inshriach supports Scotland's most successful breeding population of capercaillie, whilst the montane areas support ptarmigan and snow bunting, these being complemented by the arrival of summer breeders such as dotterel. Raptors such as golden eagle, merlin and osprey can also be sighted.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 12.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 13. The streams and lochs of the forest are ideal for otters. Red squirrels and pine martens are widespread in the pineforest, and pipistrelle and brown long-eared bats are also present. The montane areas support a population of mountain hare. History Regeneration of the forest is now leading to the re-establishment of a natural treeline Caledonian Forest first became established in Invereshie and Inshriach at the end of the last ice age. Although humans are known to have lived in the area since at least the Bronze Age, until around the mid-18th century the forest remained largely intact, with only smalls-scale felling of trees for domestic use and localised rough grazing.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 19. As the population of Scotland grew during the second half of the 18th century more people began to move into the glens of the Cairngorms, including Glen Feshie. Land began to be cleared for agriculture, and this process accelarated during the Napoleonic wars, when there was increased demand for timber. Several water-driven sawmills were built along the River Feshie and its tributaries during this period. Demand for timber continued throughout the 19th century, especially with the coming of the railways, as timber was required for sleepers, bridges and buildings. In 1850 Invereshie became a deer forest, as deer stalking and grouse shooting became popular amongst Britain's upper classes. The subsequent in deer numbers, alongside management practices such as muirburn (the burning of patches of heather to create habitats for grouse) led to a reduction in natural regeneration of the native woodland.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 20. Demand for timber increased again during the First and Second World Wars, and by the end of the Second World War only woods in the most remote parts of Scotland were still intact. Following this period, interest in preserving the remaining woodlands grew, and the Nature Conservancy (NC) purchased Invereshie in 1954, making area was made part of the Cairngorms National Nature Reserve. The NC, and its successor bodies, the Nature Conservancy Council (NCC), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), and NatureScot, made efforts to encourage regrowth of the woodland, reducing deer numbers, erecting fences to exclude deer, and planting native tree species.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 21. During this period the Inshriach Estate, to the west of Invereshie, came under the ownership of the Forestry Commission. During the 1960s and 70s Inshriach was managed mainly for commercial forestry, and non-native species such as sitka spruce and lodgepole pine were planted in the area. Since the 1990s the emphasis has changed, and the Commission began work aimed at restoring the native forest.The Story of Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature Reserve. p. 23.

Philately British Guiana 1856 1c magenta stamp The design of the 1c stamp may be better seen in this image of the 4-cent stamp of the same issue McKinnon was a collector of the stamps of British Guiana. In 1873 he bought the British Guiana 1856 1c magenta stamp for six shillings from a local schoolboy, Louis Vernon Vaughan. Vaughan had found the stamp among the effects of his uncle Andrew Hunter who had recently moved to Barbados. The stamp was probably on some sort of cover, possibly a newspaper wrapper, and soaked off by Vaughan. McKinnon initially did not want the stamp due to the clipped corners but changed his mind when he learned that Vaughan wanted to use the sale to buy other stamps that he had been sent on approval from England.Williams, L.N. & M. (1949) Stamps of Fame. London: Blandford Press. pp. 14-15. In addition to the 1c magenta, McKinnon owned all four known single used copies of the 1850 2c \\"cottonreel\\" stamps on rose-coloured paper. Victoria Law Courts, Georgetown, seen on a 1910 postcard. In 1878 McKinnon sent his British Guiana collection, included the 1c magenta, to his friend Robert Wylie Hill in Glasgow for sale. McKinnon had probably met Hill a few years earlier when Hill was in South America on an expedition to collect exotic birds. Hill first offered it to Edward Loines Pemberton but no sale resulted despite Pemberton confirming later in a letter to Frederick Philbrick that he had examined the collection and that it included a \\"ONE cent, red [magenta], 1856!!! as genuine as anything ever was\\" but commenting that it was a \\"dreadfully poor copy\\". The collection was then offered by post to several other dealers and was bought by Thomas Ridpath for ¬£120 who soon sold the 1c magenta to Philipp von Ferrary. The stamp was sold in 2014 for US$9,480,000. After selling his collection, McKinnon apparently did not continue to collect stamps.

It is kilometre 0 for the measurement of distances (chainage) on all core network lines. While the passenger traffic of the SBB ends in Chur, there is a connection with the Arosa Railway and there is a link for standard gauge freight operations using a dual gauge (three-rail) section in Untervaz and a dual gauge section (22.5 tonne axle load) for standard-gauge freight traffic from Chur to Domat/Ems for the factory premises of Ems-Chemie and the large sawmill of Mayr-Melnhof Swiss Timber AG. All rail infrastructure is metre- gauge from Domat/Ems. The line to Disentis/Must√©r branches off in Reichenau- Tamins; this connects with the trunk line of the MGB and these lines are served by Glacier Express services running between Chur and .

He is the chair of Wavertree Constituency Labour Party and has a seat on the Labour Party regional board for the northwest. He was the chair of the Socialist Health Association between 2017-20 and is involved in the Keep Our NHS Public movement. According to the constituency party he is Jewish. Biography Healthcare Scott-Samuel has published on topics related to health impact assessment, health inequalities, gender inequality and the politics of health. In 1979 he established a politics of health journal, which later became Critical Public Health. Later he established the UK Politics of Health Group. In 2014, he was the joint author of a paper published in the International Journal of Health Services which claimed that the policies of the Margaret Thatcher's government had led to the \\"unnecessary and unjust premature death of many British citizens, together with a substantial and continuing burden of suffering and loss of well-being\\". In 2015 he described Simon Stevens, Chief Executive of NHS England as the \\"cheerleader-in-chief for NHS privatisation\\". He supported the campaign to preserve the independence of Liverpool Women's Hospital, saying that the proposal to move it was part of the government plans to cut services and eventually privatise them. In 2017, he stood for election to the Momentum executive, and said that he was \\"an adviser to Labour's shadow health minister\\". At the 2017 Labour Party Conference, he proposed a motion on health policy on behalf of the Socialist Health Association calling for the reinstatement of the NHS \\"as per the NHS Bill (2016-17)\\". It was carried unanimously. Controversy According to The Washington Post he is a fervent Corbyn supporter and was a major antagonist of former Labour MP Luciana Berger. He is said, by The Jewish Chronicle, to be at centre of allegations concerning the antisemitic bullying of Berger and to be associated with John McDonnell. He submitted a motion of no confidence in her which was subsequently withdrawn after Tom Watson called for the Wavertree party to be suspended. According to Nick Cohen he is Berger's chief enemy. The Economist included him in a list of conspiracy theorists on the Labour left in March 2019 and the Times called him a swivel-eyed middle-aged conspiracy theorist. He has appeared several times on a conspiracy theorist radio show, the Richie Allen programme, promoted by David Icke.

Johann Freiherr von O'Brien, Earl of Thomond (1775 ‚Äì 1830), was an Austrian Major General with Irish ancestry, most noted for leading an action in Jedlesee, 1809, near Vienna, against a superior force of Napoleon's troops in preparation for their defeat by Archduke Charles in the Battle of Aspern. Life and career Johann von O'Brien was born in 1775 near Kar√°nsebes, Banat, Romania and died on 5 September 1830 in Pest, Hungary. Following in his father's footsteps, he enrolled in the Neust√§dt Academy in Karansebes. In September 1794 he joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant, serving there from 1799 to 1801. Promoted to Major in 1805, he joined the General Staff at the beginning of October of his last year, and in June 1808 was transferred to the Kerpen Infantry regiment.Der Milit√§r-Maria-Theresien-Orden und seine Mitglieder Biographical entry on Johann Freiherr von O‚ÄôBrien, pp. 961ff.Constantin von Wurzbach: O‚ÄôBrien, Graf auf Thomond, Johann Freiherr.

By the time of the War of the Fifth Coalition, O'Brien had already exhibited insight and determination, rendering service to the extent that he was not only repeatedly commended but also rewarded by promotion to Commander of the 1st Battalion. On 13 May 1809, as Major General of the Lower Austrian 49th Infantry Regiment, he succeeded in preventing the formation of a French bridgehead on the left bank of the Danube near Jedlesee, thereby enabling the deployment of troops under Archduke Charles in northern Vienna. The French under Napoleon, who occupied Vienna without a fight on the right bank of the Danube on the same day, were thus unable to cross the Danube until 20 May southeast of Vienna at the Lobau, where the Battle of Aspern then took place.Napoleon in Wien: Fakten und Legenden (Johannes Sachslehner, Robert Bouchal - Pichler, 2008).Fad√≥ Fad√≥: More Tales of Lesser-Known Irish History (R√≥n√°n Gear√≥id √ì Domhnaill - Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2015), p.54 ff. When French troops began gathering on the left bank of the Danube opposite Nussdorf in May 1809 after the capture of Vienna, in order to create the conditions for a Danube crossing, the 49th infantry regiment received the order to clear the Schwarzlackenau floodplain behind the \\"Black Lacquer\\" (Schwarze Lacke) Danube arm and, together with Lieutenant Colonel Obergfell's Lower Austrian Landwehr batallion, to defend it against further attempts by the enemy to cross the territory. The regiment had to expel 6 Grenadier and 3 Voltigeur companies of Oudinot's corps from the Au. With only 50 volunteers, O'Brien succeeded in getting into the rear of the enemy and creating panic among them by the unexpected attack. The French lost 230 men dead and wounded, with 15 officers and 370 men captured. This action was a prerequisite for the success of Archduke Charles at Aspern. O'Brien was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.Military Maria Theresia Order Ritterkreuz (RK) In O'Brien's honour, a monument was erected in Jedlesee, consisting of a five-metre-high obelisk with an imperial orb created by A. Weinguni, on top of which stands an eagle with outspread wings (unveiled on 17 June 1909; renovated in 1932 and 1959). O'Brien-Gasse in Vienna's district of Floridsdorf (named on 27 June 1913) is named after him. Both sites are near the former battlefield. The Hesser Monument of Infantry Regiment No. 49 at the G√ºrtel near Vienna's Westbahnhof station also commemorates the action.

The museum focusses on the European culture of free thinking of the past 2.000 years, with Hermetic wisdom as the source of inspiration: insight into the connection between God, cosmos and man. This connection is reflected in the Hermetic, alchemical, astrological, magical, mystical, kabbalistic and Rosicrucian texts and images in the collection. History The Embassy of the Free Mind was opened in October 2017 by the author Dan Brown. The roots of the museum lie in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica (Ritman Library). This scientific research library, with a collection of 25.000 books and an own publisher dates back from 1958 when Amsterdam based businessman Joost Ritman started it as a private library. In 1984 the library got open for general public and moved within Amsterdam to the Bloemstraat. Ritman brought together manuscripts and printed books in the area of the hermetic tradition, took care of the coherence of the diverse collection and showed their importance and relevancy for the world today. Since the opening the library focussed on activities like expanding the collection, the development of expertise within the Ritman research institute and the growth of its own publisher In de Pelikaan. In 2009 the library obtained the status of Public Benefit Organisation (PBO). By moving to the House of the Heads in 2017 and obtaining the status of museum, resulting in the Embassy of the Free Mind, the organisation takes a new step in making the collection more accessible for a wider audience. Building The Embassy of the Free Mind is located in the 17th century Amsterdam building the Huis met de Hoofden on the Keizersgracht 123. The canal house was built in 1622 by Hendrick de Keyser and is listed as one of the 'Top 100 buildings of the Dutch Rijksdienst'. Six heads adorn the fa√ßade. They depict the Roman gods Apollo, Ceres, Mercury, Minerva, Bacchus and Diana. God of commerce Mercury and goddess of wisdom Minerva were placed left and right of the central entrance in the 17th century to make it clear that this was the home of a wise merchant (Mercator Sapiens). Lodewijk and Laurens de Geer, from 1634 residents of the House with the Heads for 150 years, were besides affluent entrepreneurs also patrons of free thinkers and made the printing of their works possible. Their home library of approximately 6,000 books shows similarities with the books that are now once again in the museum library. Collection The Museum has a collection of more than 25.000 books on Hermetica, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism, gnosis, Western esotericism and religious studies. Other collection areas within the library cover sufism, kabbalah, anthroposophy, freemasonry and grail. The library owns c. 4500 manuscripts and printed books before 1900 and more than 20.000 books (primary and secondary sources) printed after 1900. In the collection of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica are located: Corpus Hermeticum, published in 1503 and printed on parchment, Robert Fludd‚Äôs Utriusque cosmi historia, published in 1617. Moreover, the museum possesses Atalanta Fugiens written by Michael Maier, Biblia Polyglotta written by Christoffel Plantijn and a widespread collection of works by Gustav Meyrink.

She is remembered for her efforts to improve the working conditions of teachers from the 1890s, for her contributions to magazines calling for improved conditions for working women and, in the 1900s, for her support for votes for women. She was an active member of various women's organizations. Early life and education Born on 19 August 1855 in Milan, Linda Malnati was the daughter of Giacomo and Carolina Pedrioli. Educated in the city's democratic environment, she acquired an interest in social justice and women's emancipation, strongly influenced by the feminists Laura Solera Mantegazza, Alessandrina Massini Ravizza and Anna Maria Mozzoni. Professional life Her first article, published in the Republican journal Libert√† e associazione was Alle donne e specialmente alle donne italiane (To Women and Specially to Italian Women). In 1875, she was employed by the Municipality of Milan as a schoolteacher for the lower grades, and in 1888 for the higher grades. She was dedicated to teaching, believing that education and emancipation were behind the regeneration of society, leading to democratic development. She was also committed to improving the living and working conditions of teachers, including equal pay for men and women, a topic she wrote about in a variety of journals and newspapers. With a view to encouraging women workers to organize themselves, together with Anna Kuliscioff and Carlotta Clerici, in 1890 she established a women's section at Milan's Camera del lavoro, forming a kind of trade union. In 1893, she established a section for schoolteachers while revitalizing and chairing the Lega per la tutela degli interessi femminili (League for Protecting Women's Interests) which had been created by Mozzoni in 1881. In the late 1890s, she took part in the workers demonstrations, especially in the events of May 1898. Writing in Vita femminile (Women's Life), she commented on the relationship between socialism and feminism, calling on women to combine the class struggle with the gender struggle. Among the women's organizations in which she was active, in 1903 she established a Comitato per il risveglio dell'attivit√† femminile (Committee for Awakening Women's Activity) under Milan's Teachers' Association. This caused a number of male teachers to form their own Men's Society. She also promoted pre-school education and supported the Milan Popular University as a member of the steering committee. In contrast to the dogma of the socialist party, Malnati considered women's suffrage the cornerstone of women's emancipation and development. After Roberto Mirabelli had raised the matter of universal suffrage in parliamentary discussions in 1904, together with Mozzoni she established the Comitato milanese Pro Suffragio (Milan Suffrage Committee) in 1906 as well as a national coordination committee. At the Milan Convention in April 1907 organized by the Catholics, she stressed the importance of votes for women. The following year, at the National Congress of Italian Women, she went as far as tabling a motion to ban religious education in primary schools, replacing it with comparative religion classes. After the motion was adopted, the Catholics broke off their collaboration with secular women's associations, creating their own women's organization. In 1914, together with Clerci she proposed establishing a league for neutrality. During the First World War, she helped with civil assistance work and cared for refugees. From 1914 to 1920, she ran the Le Stelline orphanage with which she had long been associated. In 1917, she once again took up the cause of peace, promoting international involvement. Suffering from a serious illness, Linda Malnati retired to Blevio on the eastern shore of Lake Como where she died on 22 October 1921.

It was originally the Siebold Farm and then the Realy Farm. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History In 1844, Johannes Siebold emigrated to the United States from the town of Endersbach in Germany, along with his new wife Fredrika and her two children by an earlier marriage, Johannes Jacob and Katrinka Ruehle. The family briefly stayed in Ann Arbor before traveling to Jackson County, Waterloo Township, where they purchased this property in 1846 from James Goodwin, an immigrant from England. James Goodwin, his wife Sarah Goodwin and five children were already living in a log cabin on the property. Sarah and their youngest daughter, Emma, aged 4, died in 1842 (presumably from illness) and are buried on the farm. Siebold began farming. The farm prospered, and in 1854, Siebold constructed a new house, which is now the northern section of the present farmhouse. Within a few years, the remainder of the farmhouse was built. At Siebold's death, the farm passed to his step-son, Johannes Jacob Ruehle. Ruehle married Catherine Archenbronn, then served in the Civil War, where his name was changed to \\"Realy.\\" The Realys had seven children, five of whom remained unmarried and lived on the farm throughout their lives. As the farm progressed into the twentieth century, it became known for its cider, processed in a cider mill that once stood across the street from the farmhouse. The Realy family lived on the farm until it was encompassed by the creation of the Waterloo State Recreation Area. When the last Realy brother died, the state of Michigan took possession of the property. The state demolished the barns and cider mill. In 1962, the e Waterloo Area Historical Society was formed to save and restore the remainder of the farm. The Society arranged to lease three acres of land surrounding the farmyard from the state, on the condition they maintain the farm as a museum. The Society opened the farm as a museum, and it continues to be open to the public. Description The Siebold farmhouse is a two-story brick structure built in two sections, distinguished by the gable roofs running at right angles to each other. Another L-shaped section on one side of the house is 1-1/2 stories high and is covered with clapboard siding. The house contains patches of fieldstone decorating the bricks. The house has a bay on the one side and three porches, all of which have Victorian style wood trim. One porch and the bay have wood shingle roofs. On the interior, rooms include a pantry, dining room, sitting room, parlor, young girl's bedroom, weaving room, children's room, large front bedroom, parents' bedroom, and drying room. The clapboard section of the house was used as a work area, and contains a kitchen, hired man's quarters, and wood shed. The farm also contains outbuildings, including a ten-foot Perkins windmill, a milk house, ice house, bake house, and a former hog barn (now a repair shop). The original barns and cider mill were demolished in the early 1960s.

It was located in the west of the old town, approximately at the point where today's F√§rbergraben and Augustinerstra√üe meet on Kaufingerstra√üe.  History  The gate was first mentioned in 1239 under the name porta superior (Upper Gate) in correspondence to the east lying city porta inferior (Lower Gate) or Talburgtor (= today's tower of the Old Town Hall). Through these two gates, the salt road led through Munich to the west. The gate was a simple tower with gate passage. After the construction of the outer city wall, the gate tower of the merchant family Kaufinger served as a residential tower and was named after them. The gate was demolished in 1479 and rebuilt until 1484 in late Gothic style. In 1510, the gate received a clock and a rich exterior frescoed fresco. Because of this, the gate was mostly referred to as Sch√∂ner Turm (Beautiful Tower) from then on. In 1807 it was demolished. Reminders At the corner Kaufingerstra√üe / Augustinerstra√üe (Kaufingerstra√üe 28: Hirmer-Haus) there is a sculpture of the gate tower and next to it a commemorative plaque with another depiction of the tower.

The C3P3 expression system can be used for living eukaryotic cells (in cellulo) or organisms (in vivo), but so far its uses has been only reported for mammals. However, due to conservation of mRNA structure and its modifications in the eukaryotic kingdom that mimed by this system, its use has been proposed for other species eukaryotic species (e.g. yeasts, plants or other animals).https://biosynsys2016.sciencesconf.org/111450/document The C3P3 system consists of two components: firstly, an artificial enzyme produced by synthetic engineering and secondly specific DNA templates that contain a coding sequence under control of the C3P3 promoter . The specific DNA templates are therefore transcribed by the C3P3 enzyme and generate the mRNA of interest in the cytoplasm of host-cells. When assembled these two components synthesize high levels of mature messenger RNA and/or non-coding RNA in the host-cell cytoplasm without using the host cell transcriptional machinery. In its first generation, the C3P3 enzyme would be a single-subunit protein made by the fusion of the African swine fever virus (AFSV) capping enzyme with a mutant DNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the K1E bacteriophage.https://biosynsys2016.sciencesconf.org/111450/document Such C3P3 enzyme produces mRNA capping modifications, which are found at the 5‚Äô-ends of mRNA and are strictly required for the translation of eukaryotic mRNA, i.e. the production of proteins.

The first meeting was held on April 23, 1902; Frederick Vernon Coville was elected president, Charles Louis Pollard was elected secretary, and Elizabeth Gertrude Britton was elected to the Board of Managers. Other members of the board included Charles Edwin Bessey, Liberty Hyde Bailey, William Trelease, Charles Frederick Millspaugh, and Alice Eastwood. The Society established numerous local chapters. It was incorporated in the state of New York in 1915. For a time, the Society published The Plant World, a journal that began publication in 1897. By 1924, the scope of this formerly national organization was limited to New York.

More specifically, it is concerned with ‚Äûthe study of cross-national perceptions and images as expressed in literary discourse‚Äú. While it adopts a constructivist perspective on national stereotypes, it does emphasize that these stereotypes may have real social effects. It was developed in the 1950s with practitioners in France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. It never gained much of a foothold in anglophone academia. This may be attributed to imagology's skewed relationship to Edward Said‚Äôs influential Orientalism, which is much better known in this context.  History  National stereotypes were long seen as intrinsic properties of ethnic groups. Hippolyte Taine is a major representative of this positivist view. In his Histoire de la litt√©rature anglaise (1863) he held that cultural artefacts are determined by three factors: moment, milieu and race. The voluntarist view of what it means to belong to a nation was expressed by Ernest Renan in his lecture \\"Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?\\" (What is a nation?) in 1882.Ernest Renan, \\"Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?\\", lecture held in Sorbonne, 11 March 1882, Accessed June 5, 2019 Renan argues that citizens may choose to affiliate themselves to a particular nation. Leerssen terms this view proto-imagological, because national identity was still held to be an independently existing entity. Imagology as the study of literary representations of national stereotypes emerged from the French school of comparative literature. The scholars who founded the Revue de la litt√©rature compar√©e in 1921 (Paul van Tieghem, Fernand Baldensperger, Paul Hazard) had an historical interest in literature and wanted to go beyond the study of national images as if they were historical facts. Marius-Fran√ßois Guyard dedicated a whole chapter to the subject, called \\"L‚Äô√©tranger tel qu‚Äôon le voit\\" in his book La Litterature compar√©e (1951). This chapter analyses novels that represent nations other than the author's own. As the title already suggests, Guyard did not assume that these images reflected national essences, but rather treated them as representations. This shift from essences to representations turns Guyard into a founding father of imagology, which is premised on the assumption that ‚Äúthe images which one studies are seen as properties of texts, as the intellectual produce of a discourse‚Äù. His inclusion of the subject into the study of comparative literature was contested by Ren√© Wellek. This leading figure in US comparative literature argued that the study of cross-national images should not become part of comparative literature, for this would turn it into an auxiliary discipline to International relations. A rift between the American and French schools of Comparative Literature ensued, which limited the international action radius of imagology.  Theoretical assumptions  Imagologists call the representation of national stereotypes \\"ethnotypes\\". Those ethnotypes are regarded as discursive objects rather than objectively existing phenomena. They are always defined against an Other, generating an opposition between auto-images and hetero-images. An auto-image is the representation of the self, while an hetero image is the representation of the Other. These representations stress difference, in keeping with the assumption that ‚Äúa nation is most characteristically itself in precisely those aspects in which it is most different from others‚Äù. In ethnotyping, national character serves as an explanatory factor for the behaviour of the actors in literary representations. Oppositional patterns such as North-South, East-West or Centre-Periphery with their concomitant stereotypes serve to contrast nations, regions or continents to each other. In this multi-scalar logic, the same location can be the Centre to one Other and the Periphery to another Other. These representations are changing over time, depending on multiple factors, such as the political and social climate and literary trends.  Method  Since imagology studies literary representations and not societies as such, it is a methodology for the humanities, not for social sciences.Beller, Manfred, and Joep Leerssen. 2007. Imagology : The Cultural Construction and Literary Representation of National Characters : A Critical Survey. Studia Imagologica, 13. Amsterdam: Rodopi. Following the theoretical assumption that ethnotypes are not measurable against an objective reality, the research focus is not on the truth-value of a representation but rather on its representation-value. Concretely, this means that imagological research can never raise the question of whether author A has correctly represented nation B, because national character for imagologists is non-existent outside of the literary construction. Rather, imagological research inquires into the development, construction or effects of auto-images, hetero-images or meta-images an author creates in his work. A meta-image is the image an author writing from nation A about nation B attributes to the view of nation B on nation A. Furthermore, it is of interest to see how ethnotypes influenced each other in comparing nationalities, time periods or genres. Imagological analysis inquires the intertextual, contextual and textual aspects of ethnotypes. The intertext of an ethnoytpe is established through researching literary representations of the same nation in the same time period. The rationale is to investigate influences of the existing body of literary representations of a nation on the case under study. This can lead to the examination of whether a literary representation of a specific nation has changed over time. For instance, ethnotypes were traditionally often portrayed in sharply contrasting binary terms. In the late nineteenth century authors increasingly used ambiguity and irony in their representations, to make them more nuanced. The contextual dimension targets the historical, social, political and economic background in which the text was written, since it is assumed that the author's immediate environment influences his/her representations. War between two countries for instance will most probably impart negative connotations to their mutual ethnotypes, while nationalism tends to reinforce the political instrumentalization of auto-images. The textual dimension of imagological analysis examines the text as such, focusing on genre conventions and rhetorical strategies.

Unlike in consecutive interpreting, this way the natural flow of the speaker is not disturbed and allows for a fairly smooth output for the listeners.  History  The Nuremberg trials (1945‚Äì1946) are considered to be the official birthdate of simultaneous interpretation, however, simultaneous interpretation was invented as early as in 1926. A patent was received by an IMB employee Gordon Finley and was used sporadically before the WWII. Finley played an essential role in the design and development of SI equipment together with Edward Filene, the American businessman and philanthropist. In 1925, E. Filene wrote a letter to Sir. E. Drummond in which the concept simultaneous interpretation is used for the first time in written history. In this letter, E. Filene talked about his idea to use simultaneous interpretation in the League of Nations as early as April 2, 1925. Filene wrote to Sir. E. Drummond on that day: > One high-quality microphone will be placed on a pedestal or stand at the > speaker's location to pick up his words. This microphone will be connected > through an amplifier to a number of headsets which will be installed in an > adjoining quiet room. Each headset will terminate at an interpreter's booth > or position in the room. The interpreter's booth will be provided with an > ordinary telephone desk stand on which is mounted a high quality close > talking microphone which will be connected through another amplifier to a > number of head set located at a designated section of the auditorium or > meeting hall. The translated speech of each interpreter would follow > simultaneously with the delivery of the original speech, the only delay > being that of recording the speech and the ability of the interpreter to > translate directly and rapidly from the stenographic notes received from the > recorder. The Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages: English, French, German and Russian. It was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. This led to the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real-time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish. Interpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were a broad sense of culture, encyclopedic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition. Yet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn, revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were recruited into the newly formed United Nations.  Pros and cons  Because there are no long pauses for the interpreter to stop and think through the speech during simultaneous interpretation, this type of interpretation allows for a smooth experience for the listeners as they don't need to wait to understand the message. Therefore, simultaneous interpretation is best-suited for large-scale events and conferences where the delay in the delivery of the speech could ruin the experience of the event. On the downside, simultaneous interpretation can be stressful for the interpreters because they have to do their best in a very limited time and they usually don't know the text until they hear it (just the topic). Also, simultaneous interpreters have to do their best to keep the tone and the choice of words of the speaker, which adds even more stress.  Modes  * Simultaneous interpretation with electronic/electric equipment ‚Äì Using this method, the information is transferred into the target language the moment interpreters understand a \\"unit\\" of meaning. The speakers and the interpreters talk into microphones, and the interpreters and the listeners use earphones. * Whispered interpreting or chuchotage ‚Äì This is simultaneous interpreting without equipment. It works just like simultaneous interpretation with equipment but in this case, no microphones or headphones are used. Simultaneous interpreters sit next to the people who do not understand the source language and whisper the translation in their ears.  Equipment  Traditional conference interpreting equipment (hardware) helps to make sure that all listeners can understand interpretation well. How does simultaneous interpretation with traditional hardware look: # The speaker talks into a microphone. # His or her speech is broadcast to the interpreter who sits in a sound-proof interpreter booth and listens through headphones. # As the interpreter listens to the speech, he or she translates it in real-time into a microphone. # The interpretation is transmitted wirelessly to the headphones of the event attendees.  Interpretation system types   Infrared systems  This technology uses invisible pulses of light to transmit the translation feed. Attendees receive the stream to their headphones via multi-channel receivers. * This system is sensitive to obstruction, so it must be placed in front of the listeners (in a clear line of sight). * It also can't be covered with other objects like curtains or drapes to. * Very bright or flashing lights can interfere with infrared systems, so they should be avoided. * To increase the range, several infrared emitters have to be used.  Medium range FM interpretation systems (handheld)  These systems use radio waves to transmit the speech (either original or translated) to the attendees. Just like infrared systems, FM systems are also connected to multi-channel receivers with headphones. * FM systems are portable ‚Äì light and easy to carry around. * Unlike infrared systems, FM systems are not sensitive to obstructions, meaning they can penetrate walls and other opaque objects. They're also not sensitive to light, and work well outside. * Their portability comes with a more limited range though (around 250 feet).  Longer range FM systems (portable)  If the venue of the event exceeds 1000 feet, longer range FM systems are needed. But with great power also comes‚Ä¶ more weight. These systems are still portable, though it is more difficult to move them around compared to medium range FM systems. * More power means better cancellation of radio interference, which in turn means more quality in the sound of the translation transmitted. * Longer range FM systems are also more cost-effective than medium range for a larger audience. * The biggest drawback is immobility. Yes, longer range FM interpretation systems are still portable but they're not mobile. These transmitters are usually fixed, meaning speakers and attendees can't move too far from them, or they will not hear the speech.  Interpreter booths  Interpreter booths are a must for simultaneous interpretation where traditional equipment is used. Interpreters have to be in the venue and it tends to get quite noisy. Having in mind the stress the interpreters have to endure during big conferences, it is very important to ensure they have a sound-proof working environment ‚Äì that is, interpreter booths. Interpreter booths can be either permanent or mobile. Both variants are strictly regulated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards relating to conference interpreting. As for the shape, interpreter booths come as tabletop booths and as full-size interpreting booths. As the name suggests, the first ones are placed on the top of the table and are great because they're easy to transport and set up. On the other hand, they're open in the back, which means you can't completely ensure comfortable work conditions for the interpreters because these booths are not fully sound-proof. Full-size interpreter booths are like little houses. They have walls, floor, ceilings, doors, and their own ventilation systems. Usually, they can fit at least two interpreters and larger booths can fit even four. Naturally, such interpreter booths are much harder to transport and assemble and require at least a couple of technicians for this task. * Interpreters need to have a clear view of speakers, the podium and presentations. * Interpreters also need great access to the Internet. * They also need to have a sufficient number of power outlets for their laptops, tablets and any other gadgets they may need to work. * High air quality is a non-negotiable for obvious reasons, too. That's where sensors that measure CO2 step in. * Optimal acoustic conditions, meaning fans should be as quiet as possible and sound insulation from other booths should be close to perfection.  Interpretation apps  An alternative to traditional interpretation systems is mobile apps. IT specialists in simultaneous interpretation field developed systems that can work alone or in combination with traditional translation hardware. Simultaneous interpretation apps are mobile systems that stream real-time audio on listeners' phones through local wifi or listeners' mobile data. The speaker's stream is transmitted to interpreters who then, with a special broadcaster or traditional consoles, stream their interpretations. Interpreters can work either onsite or remotely, in which case translation booths are no longer needed. Likewise, people can listen to the stream from anywhere.

After the Nazis came to power in 1933, she had to give up on journalism and started working as a nanny.

Her parents were murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In London, Eick worked as a nanny and housekeeper and met her partner Getrud Klingel. They moved to Devon, where they opened a nursery and Eick started writing again. Her collection of poems, Immortal Muse, was published in 1984 and turned into a short film called The Immortal Muse by Jules Hussey in 2005.

It is used primarily by the LGBT+ community in Mainland China, though the term has origins in the Taiwanese term for lesbian, lazi (). Beginning in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, lala communities started to form in urban areas of China, such as Beijing and Shanghai, using bars and online chatrooms to connect. In 2005, a group of young self-identifying lalas in Beijing founded les+ Magazine, China's first and only queer women's magazine. Despite legal restrictions in China over LGBT issues, les+ has found subscribers in all 23 Provinces of China as well as several countries abroad. The slogan printed on the magazine's first issue read: \\"After the darkness fades away, I‚Äôll be holding your hand, walking under the sunlight with pride, boldly and happily living our lives!\\" In 2012, Lucetta Kam Yip-lo, an assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), published the book Shanghai Lalas: Female Tongzhi Communities and Politics in Urban China. Kam's monograph features interviews with 25 Chinese lalas, female bisexuals, and trans women living in Shanghai, most of whom were women in their twenties from urban areas.  Origins  The term lazi first entered the Mainland Chinese lexicon through Taiwanese writer Qiu Miaojin's novel The Crocodile's Journal (1994), which features a central character named Lazi.

It has three tiers, whereby the lower two tiers are separated from the upper tier by a molded cornice. The front facade shows six pilaster; the pilasters and the cornice are painted white with the main walls are painted in green.

Dante's portrayal There is not much historical information about him, but taking Dante's reference to him as a starting point, commentators have portrayed a biography of him that largely follows the passage of the Inferno - (Canto trentesimo, vv. 32-33 and 42-45). In the forger's edict, he is condemned for \\"personal falsification\\", that is for having cheated others by taking the place of . Other views The question widely debated by the glossators, albeit with some differences but substantially the same, is that this Schicchi was famous for the imitations of people and that when the rich widower and childless Buoso died, he, at the request of his friend Simone Donati, Buoso's nephew, sneaked into the bed of the deceased shortly after his death and called a notary and dictated a will in favor of Simone, which was promptly ratified. For himself, it seems that he was entitled only one mare (quoted by Dante) which is an indication of the burlesque and novella character of what happened. Works inspired by Schicci Starting from this story, and with much lighter and more pleasant stylistic characters, Giacomo Puccini composed the op√©ra comique Gianni Schicchi, performed in 1918. Another famous play is the comedy Gianni Schicchi by Gildo Passini, which made its successful debut in Milan in 1922 at the Olympia theatre, staged by the Compagnia Talli-Melato-Betrone.

It is now owned by Sor√∏ Academy The half-timbered main building dates from the beginning of the 19th century. History In the late 16th century N√∏rup was a copyhold under Sor√∏ Abbey which after the Reformation had been converted intoa royal fief. Up through the 17th century it was used as a royal hunting lodge. In 1672, Christian V ceded the estate to Ulrik Christian Gyldenl√∏ve. In 1678, he ceded it to Frederik Gabel. He was already the owner of Bavelse og Bregentved. In 1686, Gabel sold it to Niels Christoffersen. After his death his heirs sold it to Christian Bonorden who shortly thereafter sold it to Johan Haxen. Haxen's widow married Niels Fogh who then owned the estate until it was sold in auction in 1710, Im 1716, M√∏rdrup was acquired by Christian Luxdorph. Luxdorph, a son of Bolle Luxdorph, was a colonel in the infantry. He died just 42years old in 1736, leaving a wife, Susanne Magdalene Worm, and their 10-year-old son, Bolle Willum Luxdorph. Bolle Willum Luxdorph inherited the farm after his mother's death in 1735. The farm was destroyed by fire in 1743 and Luxdorph chose to sell it in 1748. The new owner was Laurs Bi√∏rn. He sold it to Holger Skeel om 1755. In 1772, Skeel 's widow sold it to Eggert Christoffer Knuth, count of Knuthenborg and Gyldensten and occupant of Lerchenfeldt. Knuth converted M√∏rup into a Fee tail (Danish: Stamhus). After his death in 1776 it was passed on to his sonm Henrik Knuth. He had no children and was therefore succeeded by his half-brother, Frederik Knuth. In 1803. the fee tail was dissolved. M√∏rup was then sold to Iver Ammitsb√∂ll. His widow Dorothea Elisabeth married the estate's tutor, Peter Diderik Ibsen. In 1825, Ibsen obtained a position as parish priest on Funen and M√∏rup was then sold in auction. The biuer was Sor√∏ Academu. The estate was then used as the Acade,u's Department of Agriculture and Forestry. It welcomed the first students in 1830. The department closed again in 1935. Architecture M√∏rup is a three-winged complex dating from the beginning of the 19th century. The main wing (east wing) is a half-timbered building a gabled median risalit9. The roof is a red tile roof. Today M√∏rup is still owned by Sor√∏ Academy. The estate covers 268.00 hectares. M√∏rup Skov was originally part of the estate. It is also owned by Sor√∏ Academy.

It is the first extant translation of the Politics into a modern vernacular language.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 11. Politics, Economics and Ethics (Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF), Departement of manuscripts, RC-A-28551). 1st medallion: Charles V of France orders Oresme to translate the book. 2nd medallion: Translation by a canon (priest). 3rd medallion: Return to the king to present the translation. Accompanied by a bailiff and a clerc carrying the translation. 4th medallion: presentation of the book to Charles V.  Historical background  There is no evidence for the reception or translation of Aristotle's Politics by Arabic philosophers during the Islamic Golden Age.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 23-24. It was introduced to the Latin West by William of Moerbeke's Latin translation from the Greek original in the 1260s. Soon after the translation was finished, Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas wrote commentaries on it, trying to illuminate its sometimes obscure meaning and to reconcile it with Christian doctrine. Thomas' unfinished commentary was continued by Peter of Auvergne. The first known French translation of the Politics by Pierre de Paris is lost.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 11. Before starting work on his own translation, Oresme was already a distinguished academic. Having probably studied the artes liberales with Jean Buridan at the University of Paris, he was admitted into the Coll√®ge de Navarre at the same university in 1348. In 1356, he acquired a master's degree in theology and become grand-ma√Ætre of the Coll√®ge, before receiving a doctorate in theology in 1362. While studying and teaching there, he had contacts with Pierre Bersuire, Jean de Muris, Philippe de Vitry, and Guillaume Machaut. It is unclear whether Oresme was officially commissioned to come up with a solution for the financial crisis of the French monarchy in the 1350s, or whether he gained the royal family's attention by presenting said solution of his own accord. In 1355, he published his Tractatus de mutatione monetarum,The De Moneta of Nicholas Oresme and English Mint Documents, ed. by Charles Johnson, London 1956 (Medieval texts). followed a year later by a French translation (known as the Traicti√© de la Monnoie).Traictie de la premi√®re invention des monnoies, ed. by Louis Wolowski, Paris 1864 (https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5585z) In this work, he used Aristotelian thought to promote an end to the constant debasement of coinage practiced by King John II to pay for the Hundred Years' War. In the turmoil following John II's capture at the Battle of Poitiers, Oresme appears to have supported the dauphin and newly-appointed regent in the absence of the king, Charles (later King Charles V). Charles' and his father's right to rule was being challenged by several factions within the French kingdom: King Charles II of Navarre questioned the Valois' dynastic legitimacy and tried to mobilise the French nobility and the citizens of Paris and other bonnes villes in order to seize the French throne for himself. At the same time, the merchants of Paris, under their leader Etienne Marcel, tried to limit royal power, especially in financial matters, by having the Estates- General pass the Great Ordinance of 1357. Meanwhile, a peasants' rebellion in Northern France known as the Jacquerie challenged the nobility's right to rule. While the noblemen suppressed the peasants, Charles of Navarre discredited himself by joining ranks with the partly violent merchants of Paris who not long after murdered their leader Marcel. Thus the resistance against Valois rule collapsed mostly of its own accord.Raymond Cazelles: Soci√©t√© politique, noblesse et couronne sous Jean Le Bon et Charles V, Gen√®ve 1982 (M√©moires et documents publi√©s par la Soci√©t√© de l'√âcole des Chartes, 28). After this major crisis and after ascending the throne in 1364, Charles V started a cultural programme of scientific writing and translations to support his dynasty's fragile legitimacy and to facilitate governing. The target audience of this programme were his councillors and courtiers whose Latin was mostly insufficient to easily read the original texts.Vanina Kopp: Der K√∂nig und die B√ºcher. Sammlung, Nutzung und Funktion der k√∂niglichen Bibliothek am sp√§tmittelalterlichen Hof in Frankreich, Ostfildern 2016 (Beihefte der Fancia, 80). Between 1370 and 1377, at the behest of Charles V, Oresme translated and annotated Aristotle's moral works, namely the Nicomachean Ethics, the Politics, and the pseudo-Aristotelian Economics, into French. Probably as a reward for this accomplishment, he was appointed bishop of Lisieux in 1378, where he died in 1382.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 13-22. A printed version of the Politiques was published in 1489 by Antoine V√©rard. Oresme's translation was later replaced by who in 1568 published his French translation from the Greek original.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 30.  Methods of translation and annotation  Oresme justified his translation from Latin, the savant language of his time, to the more vulgar Middle French as part of the translatio studii. He coined numerous French neologisms still used today by giving originally Greek terms a French ending and sounding.Serge Lusignan: Lire, indexer et gloser : Nicole Oresme et la ‚Ä∫Politique‚Äπ d'Aristote, in: Caroline Bourlet, Annie Dufour (eds.): L '√©crit dans la soci√©t√© medievale. Divers aspects de sa pratique du XIe au XVe si√®cle, Paris 1991, 167‚Äì181. In his glosses, he not only tried to explain Aristotle's thoughts, but also developed his own political ideas, especially concerning the political stability and durability of the relatively young Valois dynasty.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 28. Oresme makes use of earlier commentaries written by Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne, and also quotes Marsilius of Padua's Defensor pacis (1324). Oresme among others was accused of having written a French translation of this highly controversial work in 1375, but was acquitted of this charge.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 5-11.  Content  Like his predecessors Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas and Peter of Auvergne (and quite unlike Aristotle), Oresme favours monarchy as the best form of government.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 99‚Äì106. His criterium for good government is the common good. A king (by definition good) takes care of the common good, whereas a tyrant works for his own profit. A monarch can ensure the stability and durability of his reign by letting the people participate in government. This has rather confusingly and anachronistically been called popular sovereignty.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209. Like Albert the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Peter of Auvergne and especially Marsilius of Padua, whom he occasionally quotes, Oresme conceives of this popular participation as rather restrictive: only the multitude of reasonable, wise and virtuous men should be allowed political participation by electing and correcting the prince, changing the law and passing judgement.Mario Grignaschi: Nicolas Oresme et son commentaire √† la ¬´Politique¬ª d'Aristote, in: Album Helen Maud Cam, Louvain 1960 (Studies Presented to the International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions, 23), 95‚Äì151, esp. 111‚Äì112; Jacques Krynen: Aristot√©lisme et r√©forme de l'Etat, en France, au XIVe si√®cle, in: J√ºrgen Miethke (ed.): Das Publikum politischer Theorie im 14.

Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 221‚Äì225. Oresme, however, categorically denies the right of rebellion since it endangers the common good. This is possibly a consequence of his witnessing the crisis of 1356‚Äì1360 and its subsequent rebellions.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 83‚Äì84; Ulrich Meier: Molte revoluzioni, molte novit√†.

Wahrnehmungsformen, Erkl√§rungsmuster, Regelungsmechanismen, Sigmaringen 1994, 119‚Äì176, esp. 127‚Äì129. Unlike earlier commentators, Oresme prescribes the law as superior to the king's will.James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 211‚Äì212. It must only be changed in cases of extreme necessity.Jacques Krynen: L'empire du roi. Ide√©s et croyances politiques en France. XIIIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Paris 1993, 266‚Äì272. Oresme favours moderate kingship,James M. Blythe: Ideal Government and the Mixed Constitution in the Middle Ages, Princeton, New Jersey 1992, 203‚Äì242. thereby negating contemporary absolutist thought, usually promoted by adherents of Roman law.Jacques Krynen: L'empire du roi. Ide√©s et croyances politiques en France. XIIIe‚ÄìXVe si√®cle, Paris 1993, 110‚Äì124, 343‚Äì456. Furthermore, Oresme doesn't comply to contemporary conceptions of the French king as sacred, as promoted by √âvrart de Tr√©maugon in his Songe du vergier or Jean Golein in his Trait√© du sacre.Shulamith Shahar: Nicolas Oresme, un penseur politique ind√©pendant de l'entourage du roi Charles V, in: L'information historique 32 (1970), 203‚Äì209; Vanina Kopp: Der K√∂nig und die B√ºcher. Sammlung, Nutzung und Funktion der k√∂niglichen Bibliothek am sp√§tmittelalterlichen Hof in Frankreich, Ostfildern 2016 (Beihefte der Fancia, 80). Although he heavily criticises the Church as corrupt, tyrannical and oligarchical, he never fundamentally questions its necessity for the spiritual well-being of the faithful.Susan M. Babbitt: Oresme's Livre de Politiques and the France of Charles V., in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 75,1 (1985), 1‚Äì158, esp. 98‚Äì146.

Cf. http://jonas.irht.cnrs.fr/consulter/oeuvre/detail_oeuvre.php?oeuvre=3747 The individual copies usually contain Oresme's translation of the pseudo- Aristotelian Economics (Livre de Yconomique)Le Livre de Yconomique d'Aristote, ed. by Albert Douglas Menut, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 47,5 (1957), 783 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/1005717). and often form a set with Oresme's translation of the Nicomachean Ethics (Livre de Ethiques).Le livre de √âthiques d'Aristote.

L√©opold Delisle considered Ms. 223 from Avranches, Biblioth√®que municipale, to have been Oresme's personal copy as it contains the first redaction and subsequent changes as well as the Yconomiques, although a corresponding copy of the Ethiques is not extant.https://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/mirador/index.php?manifest=https://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/iiif/5628/manifest. The richly illuminated library copy presented to King Charles V is currently in possession of the Comte de Waziers in Paris and therefore not available to the public.Its corresponding copy of the Ethiques is kept at the Biblioth√®que royale de Belgique, Brussels, Ms. 09505-09506 (formerly Ms. 2902).

Reception  Oresme's Aristotelian translations may have had a major impact on King Charles V's policies: Charles' laws concerning the line of succession and the possibility of a regency for an underage king have been accredited to Oresme, as has the election of several high-ranking officials by the king's council in the early 1370s.Albert Douglas Menut: Introduction, in: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 60,6 (1970), 5‚Äì43, esp. 9.

Her university experience speaks to the \\"double jeopardy\\" of \\"navigating both race and gender within whiteness\\", embodying \\"the simultaneous invisibility and hyper-visibility\\" of being a black woman in Edinburgh during the 1910s. Life  Early life and education  Clara Christian was born in Dominica during May 1895.Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), p. 31. Her parents were Virginia Boland and George James Christian, the renowned barrister and pan-Africanist, who migrated to the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) in 1902.Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), p. 32. After her mother died, Clara was educated at a convent school in Edinburgh, Scotland. She went on to study at the Hampton Institute and Oberlin College in the United States of America, where she trained as a singer.Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), p. 36. In 1915, she enrolled as a medical student, having \\"obstinately insisted on taking a full medical course at Edinburgh\\", becoming the first black woman to study at the University of Edinburgh.Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), p.37. In Scotland, Clara was a member of the Edinburgh Afro- West Indian Association, alongside South African medical student Manasseh Robert Mahlangeni.Mitchell, Henry (22 March 2018),\\"When ‚Äúthe world came to Scotland‚Äù: student radicals at Edinburgh University, 1906-1946\\", Scottish Critical Heritage. She started a relationship with and married fellow association member and medical student Edgar Gordon, and gave birth to their first child, Barbara, in Edinburgh in 1917. Against the wishes of her father, Clara dropped out of her degree after marrying Gordon, and waited for her Trinidadian-born husband to complete his studies.  Subsequent life and legacy  After Gordon qualified in 1918, he and Clara moved to Kinguissie, near Inverness, where he worked as a doctor, and their next two children ‚Äì twins Joyce and Evelyn ‚Äì were born.\\"Dr. Edgar Fitzgerald Gordon\\", Bermuda Biographies. The couple returned to the Caribbean in 1921, and Gordon worked briefly in Trinidad, then moved on to Dominica, where he became chief medical supervisor, and where their daughter Marjorie (the mother of Moira Stuart) was born in 1921. In 1924 Gordon went to join the medical service in Bermuda, where the family subsequently settled, and Clara gave birth to sons Edgar and Kenneth. Becoming involved in the life of the community, she organized cultural gatherings, including musical soirees, at their home, and Gordon \\"established a busy practice\\". Their marriage, however, deteriorated and they separated permanently in 1927 because of \\"irreconcilable matrimonial problems\\". According to her father George James Christian, Edgar Gordon subsequently refused \\"to do his duty by her\\".Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), p. 50. In 1937 Clara successfully applied for a job in the Gold Coast as assistant matron at Achimota School (where another of G. J. Christian's daughters, Sarah, had earlier worked as a nursing sister) but turned down the post because of the job's insecurity, poor pay and poor prospects.Rouse-Jones and Appiah (2016), pp. 96, 99. Despite numerous legal battles with her former husband, Clara successfully brought up her daughters as a single mother: Barbara studied at the Royal Academy of Music, Joyce trained as a nurse in England and subsequently moved to the USA, Evelyn trained as a beautician and moved to New York, while Marjorie became a nurse in London, eventually returned to Bermuda and on her retirement joined her youngest daughter in Nova Scotia, Canada.\\"DAVIS, Marjorie Clara\\" (obituary), Halifax Today, 18 October 2017.

He is the founder of the Pro-LGBT organization in Albania.  Political activism  Kristi Pinderi, known in Albania as a LGBT rights activist, has fled Albania, and lives in Canada. He came out to his family at the age of 27. In March 2012, he established Pro-LGBT, an organisation that works mainly to raise awareness about LGBT topics. In May of that year, along with 8 other activists he pedaled at the D√´shmor√´t e Kombit Boulevard in Tirana in what was called the first pride event in Albania. During the parliamentary elections of 2013, Pinderi, together with activist Xheni Karaj, developed for the first time a series of consultations with key political parties to include LGBT rights reference in their programs. In the framework of that initiative, Pinderi and Karaj had the opportunity to meet with former Prime Minister Sali Berisha and with his challenger Socialist Party leader Edi Rama. As a result of these lobbying efforts, Albania adopted in 2016 a National Action Plan for LGBTI people, a plan that was welcomed by the former Albanian Ombudsman Igli Totozani. In December 2014, Pinderi was a co-founder of the STREHA, a residential shelter assisting homeless LGBT youth, the first such center throughout South East Europe, supported by USAID, the British Embassy in Tirana and the British organization Albert Kennedy Trust. In May 2015, along with Karaj, he produced a long-featured documentary entitled SkaNdal, directed by Elton Baxhaku and Eriona Camit. The documentary was about the history of the LGBT movement and it featured at several international film festivals, such as at the Sarajevo Film Festival, at DokuFest in Prizren, etc. In his years of activism, Pinderi is known for several heated debates in the media with politicians, and with figures from the art and culture environment, with journalists, as well as for some long lasting controversial media debates with former Albanian MP Mesila Doda (an opponent of same-sex marriages, compared by Pinderi as an Albanian Anita Bryant ) or with the singer Eneda Tarifa, whom he publicly called a homophobic person after she made some controversial comments when singer Conchita Wurst won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2014, with actor Julian Deda, with journalist Enkel Demi, etc. In June 2019, while studying at Langara College, he started working as the lead facilitator for a support group for LGBTQ+ newcomers in Surrey, British Columbia, a pilot project hosted by DIVERSEcity, a community resources and resettlement non-profit in Canada.  1997  In January 2020 he published his memoir entitled \\"1997\\", a publication supported by the European Union. During the promotion of the book, feminist activists Xheni Karaj and Gresa Hasa read short paragraphs, and lead a discussion focusing especially on the disclosure of intimate events experienced by Pinderi, such as sexual assaults and repeated violence during his adolescence in Pogradec. The book is considered the first memoir written by an openly gay man in Albania, and the first publication by an Albanian author that deals with issues such as sexual violence, and child abuse.  Personal life  At the end of May 2017, Pinderi left Albania due to the many threats, a year after the death of his mother, Liljana Priftuli, following a long illness. She was among the first mothers who publicly supported the rights of LGBT community in Albania. In an article on Dailyxtra, a Canadian media outlet, Pinderi talked about the difficult situation that the LGBT community is facing in Albania and the reasons that forced him to go to Canada, together with his partner, Erjon Tela, also one of the first LGBT rights activists in Albania.

Biography Ludwig Schmid-Reutte was born in Lechaschau, a mountain village to the west of Garmisch and Innsbruck. Franz Anton Schmid, his father, was a peasant farmer who also worked as a builder and stone mason. Ludwig attended school locally and then moved across the nearby border into Bavaria (which had recently been subsumed into an enlarged German state) and worked as a \\"Builder's henchmen\\" (\\"Maurer-Handlanger\\"). In 1878 he was able to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich where he was a pupil of fellow Tirolean Franz Defregger and of Ludwig von L√∂fftz. Lovis Corinth was a contemporary. Following his student years his first commissions involved producing paintings for churches. at the start of 1890 he teamed up with Friedrich Fehr in order to set up a private drawing and painting school in Munich. During his time at the Academy of Fine Arts Schmid-Reutte had pursued his artistic study with particular intensity in the anatomical dissecting room, and some sources describe the painting school as a specialist arts school for anatomy drawing. The academy acquired a good reputation, also providing instruction of life models to students of the ladies' academy at the Munich (women) artists' association (\\"M√ºnchner K√ºnstlerinnenverein\\"). During the 1890s in Munich he was also giving private art lessons. One young pupil was the painter-sportsman Julius Seyler (1873-1955). In 1899 Schmid-Reutte and Fehr accepted professorships at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe. Schmid- Reutte was popular with students, sometimes attracting classes of up to 60. Among his more notable students were Hermann F√∂ry, Wilhelm Gerstel and Hans Meid. Because of a nervous disorder he was obliged to resign in 1907. Two years later he died at the \\"Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Illenau f√ºr psychisch Kranke\\" (psychological spa institution) at Achern (Baden). Work After Schmid-Reutte had left behind him the influence of his Munich teacher Danegger and moved on from mainstream painting he turned increasingly to representations of the human body. His stylised monumentalist and symbolic nudes attracted considerable notice in the arts world, even if the overall number of his own pieces remained small. He is believed to have completed barely 50 works. Celebration In 1904 he was awarded the Knight's Cross First Class of the Z√§hringer Lion.

He currently serves as Secretary of State for Global Spain in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation.  Education  Manuel Mu√±iz began his studies at Runnymede College in Madrid. He then completed a Juris Doctor and was accepted into the Madrid Bar. Mu√±iz furthered his studies with a Master of Science in Financial Markets from the Instituto de Estudios Burs√°tiles (2009) in Madrid and a Master in Public Administration at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Governmennt (2011). In addition, he joined the Centre d‚Äô√©tudes et de recherches internationales (CERI) of Sciences Po in Paris, France, as a research fellow in 2012 before completing a DPhil (PhD) in International Relations at the University of Oxford, with a particular focus on European security and defence (2016).  Career  Mu√±iz at a conference at the Rafael del Pino Foundation. In 2014, Mu√±iz joined the Fundaci√≥n Rafael del Pino in Madrid, Spain as Director of the Foundation‚Äôs Global Leadership Program with the goal of training Spanish leaders in the field of global affairs. In 2015, he worked as a consultant for the UN Support Mission in Libya and provided advice on security matters. From 2015 to 2017, Mu√±iz was the Director of the Program on Transatlantic Relations at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and, between 2016 and 2017, he was also a lecturer on the geopolitical consequences of the rise of populism at Tufts University. During this time, he was selected by Esglobal as one of the 25 intellectuals redefining Iberoamerican thought. Mu√±iz was subsequently appointed a Senior Associate at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs., where he was one of the promoters of the Project on Europe and the Transatlantic Relationship, aimed at strengthening the University‚Äôs capacities for teaching, research, and policy on the relationship between the United States and Europe. In 2017, Dr. Mu√±iz became the Dean of the School of Global and Public Affairs and founded the IE Centre for the Governance of Change to examine the challenges exerted by accelerated societal and technological transformation on both the public and private sectors. In January, 2020, the Council of Ministers of the Government of Spain approved Mu√±iz‚Äôs designation as Secretary of State for Global Spain, in replacement of Irene Lozano. He assumed office on 7 February. Once in office, he enlarged the Secretariat‚Äôs competences to include economic diplomacy and became part of the Committee of Experts advising the Spanish government on the COVID-19 pandemic.  Research  Dr. Mu√±iz started his academic career working on European integration, with a particular focus on transatlantic relations, security and defence. He has also studied what he terms the ‚ÄúAnti-Elite Era‚Äù, the rise of populism, and the implosion of the International Liberal Order. As part of that process of changes in the International Order he has looked at the role of China, and the Technological Cold War emerging between China and the United States. Mu√±iz‚Äôs work has focused extensively on the impact of technology on the social contract and on the global order. His fundamental thesis is that rapid technological change has led to a fracturing of the social contract through the hollowing out of the Western middle class and, ultimately, the rise of populist politics. He has openly called for the crafting of a new Social Contract for the Digital Era in which inequities are addressed and technological change is governed through foresight and the development of a science of anticipation.

Although they saw no active service, they supplied trained gunners to siege batteries engaged on the Western Front during World War I. Origin When the Territorial Force (TF) was created from the old Volunteer Force under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, a new 'Defended Ports' unit of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) was formed from two Dumbartonshire companies of the 1st Renfrew and Dumbarton RGA (Volunteers), part of the 1st Argyll & Bute RGA (Volunteers), and personnel from the 1st Edinburgh City RGA (Volunteers). The new unit, named the Forth & Clyde Royal Garrison Artillery, totalled eight companies with its headquarters (HQ) at Edinburgh, but in 1910 it was split up, the Clyde elements being detached to form independent unit, the Clyde RGA, while the remainder became the Forth Royal Garrison Artillery at Edinburgh, with two detached companies on the north bank of the Firth of Forth.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 24, 147.Litchfield, p. 307.Litchfield, p. 298.Forth Coast Rgt at Regiments.org. The Forth RGA had the following organisation:Army List, various dates.Conrad, 1914. * HQ at Easter Road Barracks, Edinburgh * Nos 1‚Äì4 Companies at Edinburgh * No 5 Company at Hunter Street drill hall, KirkcaldyFife at Great War Centenary Drill Halls. * No 6 Company at East Leven Street, Burntisland It was designated as a Defended Ports Unit in Scottish Coast Defences, which was also based at Edinburgh and included the Regulars of No 21 Company RGA at Fort Leith.Monthly Army List August 1914.Lawes. World War I Mobilisation On the outbreak of war the Forth RGA mobilised under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel H. O'Connor, VD. Shortly afterwards TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and on 15 August 1914, the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate companies and batteries were created, releasing the 1st Line units to be sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of Siege artillery to be sent to France. The WO decided that the TF coastal gunners were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field, and 1st line RGA companies had been authorised to increase their strength by 50 per cent.WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Although complete defended ports units never left the UK, they did supply drafts of trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas. They also provided cadres as the basis on which to form complete new units for front line service. The 70th Siege Battery formed in October 1915 was based on a company (probably 1/4th Company) from the Forth RGA, and 108th Siege Battery formed in the Forth Defences in February 1916 also drew its cadre from the unit. A number of other siege batteries formed in the Forth Defences in 1915‚Äì16 (89th, 90th, 118th, 138th, 152nd, 153rd, 178th, 181st, 210th, 228th, 251st, 263rd, 293rd, and 311th) may also have included trained men from the Forth RGA among the recruits, although the Army Council Instructions did not specifically order this.Army Council Instructions, 1915‚Äì1916. Under Army Council Instruction 686 of April 1917, the coastal defence companies of the RGA (TF) were reorganised. The RGA companies serving in the Forth garrison (including one from the North Scottish RGA) were reduced from 12 companies to 10, and were to be kept up to strength with non-TF recruits:Army Council Instructions April 1917. * 1/1st Company ‚Äì became 1st Company * 1/2nd Company ‚Äì became 2nd Company * 1/3rd Company ‚Äì became 3rd Company * 1/5th Company ‚Äì became 4th Company * 1/6th Company ‚Äì became 5th Company * 2/1st Company ‚Äì became 6th Company * 2/2nd Company ‚Äì became 7th Company * 2/3rd Company ‚Äì became 8th Company * 2/4th Company ‚Äì became 9th Company * 2/5th Company ‚Äì became 10th Company 2/6th Company Forth RGA and 2/1st Company North Scottish RGA were disbanded In April 1918 the Forth Garrison comprised the following batteries:Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annexes 4 and 7. * Outer Defences: No 19 Coastal Fire Command, Inchkeith ** Inchkeith Battery 1 ‚Äì 3 x 9.2-inch Mk X guns ** Inchkeith Battery 2 ‚Äì 6 x 6-inch Mk VII guns ** Kinghorn Battery 1 ‚Äì 1 x 9.2-inch Mk X ** Kinghorn Battery 2 ‚Äì 2 x 6-inch Mk VII ** Pettycur Battery ‚Äì 2 x 6-inch Mk VII ** Leith Docks ‚Äì 2 x 6-inch Mk VII * Middle Defences: No 20 Coastal Fire Command, Inchcolm (including No 21 Company RGA) ** Cramond Battery ‚Äì 2 x 12-pounder Quick-Firing guns ** Inchmickery Battery ‚Äì 4 x 4-inch QF guns ** Inchcolm Battery 1 ‚Äì 2 x 6-inch Mk VII ** Inchcolm Battery 2‚Äì 4 x 4.7-inch QF guns ** Inchcolm Battery 3 ‚Äì 4 x 4-inch QF * Inner Defences: No 21 Coastal Fire Command, Carlingnose Point, North Queensferry ** Hound Point Battery ‚Äì 2 x 12-pdr QF ** Invergarvie Battery ‚Äì 4 x 12-pdr QF ** Coastguard Battery ‚Äì 2 x 12-pdr QF ** Downing Point Battery ‚Äì 2 x 12-pdr QF ** Armoured Train, Craigentinny ‚Äì 2 x 12-pdr QF These defences never saw action during the war. The Forth RGA was placed in suspended animation in 1919. 8-inch Howitzer Mk I on the Somme, July 1916. 70th Siege Battery, RGA 70th Siege Battery was formed under War Office Instruction No 144 of 9 October 1915 from one company (probably 1/4th Company) of the Forth RGA. It went out to the Western Front on 26 March 1916 armed with four 8-inch howitzers and joined the Northern Heavy Group (40th Heavy Artillery Group or HAG) in X Corps. This Corps was part of Fourth Army preparing for that summer's 'Big Push' (the Battle of the Somme).'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA) file WO 95/5494/4.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 195‚Äì7. Somme The role of the northern division of X Corps, the 36th (Ulster) Division, was to attack astride the River Ancre and capture the Schwaben Redoubt on the edge of the Thiepval Ridge.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 403; Sketch 22. The bombardment programme was to extend over five days, U, V, W, X and Y, before the assault was launched on Z day. The bombardment began on 24 June, but on several days the weather was too bad for good air or ground observation and the programme was extended by two days (Y1 and Y2).Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 299‚Äì305.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 142‚Äì8. When the infantry launched their assault at 07.30 on Z Day (1 July) the heavy guns lifted to successive targets, repeating the process six times. On 36th Division's front the initial assault was entirely successful, except for the area immediately adjacent to the Ancre. The Ulstermen overran the German front line trenches and dugouts, and by 08.00 they had captured the front face of the Schwaben Redoubt. Although some parties got into the German 2nd Position, the divisions on either flank had met with disaster, allowing the defenders to get into their rear. Most of the 36th Division was pinned down in the open and had to be withdrawn after dark. The gunners helped to evacuate the wounded, a process that was not completed until 3 July.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 398, 403‚Äì8, 416‚Äì21. By now massive quantities of artillery were employed for each phase of the continuing offensive as Fourth Army and later Reserve Army attacked again and again:Farndale, Western Front, pp. 149‚Äì56.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102‚Äì9. * Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14 July) * Capture of Ovillers (17 July) * Battle of Pozi√®res (23 July) * Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15‚Äì22 September) * Battle of Thiepval Ridge (26‚Äì28 September) On 3 October 70th Siege Bty transferred to 16th HAG with Reserve (later Fifth) Army, which continued to attack on the Ancre Heights until mid-November, and carried out minor operations on the Ancre through the winter.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. Vimy On 22 March 1917, 70th Siege Bty transferred to north to join 31st HAG with First Army, which was preparing for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised counter-battery (CB) fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the heavy howitzers fired further ahead to hit the rear areas on the reverse slope of the ridge, especially known gun positions. The attack went in on 9 April with I Corps and Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. On 29 May 70th Siege Bty was joined by a section from the newly-arrived 310th Siege Bty, bringing it up to a strength of six 8-inch howitzers. It came under the command of a number of different HAGs, finally joining 12th HAG with Third Army on 7 September.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì8. Cambrai In October, Third Army began preparing for its surprise attack with tanks at the Battle of Cambrai. There was to be no preliminary bombardment or registration: when the battle began with a crash of artillery at 06.20 on 20 November the German defenders were stunned, and the massed tanks completed their overcome. In most areas the attack was an outstanding success. Exploitation over succeeding days was less spectacular.Cooper, pp. 85‚Äì8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 216‚Äì30, Map 32.Miles, 1917, Vol III, pp. 26, 29. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. Because of the inclusion of 70th Siege Bty the 12th Brigade was defined as an 8-inch Howitzer Brigade, though the other three batteries were all equipped with 6-inch howitzers. 70th Siege Bty remained with this brigade until the Armistice.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. 1918 12th Brigade was part of IX Corps' Heavy Artillery in the fighting at Mont Kemmel, during the Battle of the Lys (the second phase of the German Spring Offensive) in April 1918.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 187‚Äì91.Edmonds, 1918, Vol II, p. 410. It then moved to Fourth Amy on 18 August 1918 in time for the Battle of Amiens and to participate in the victorious Hundred Days Offensive. By the end of September Fourth Army had closed up to the Hindenburg Line. 12th Brigade came under the command of IX Corps once more for the assault crossing of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September. The canal defences were largely destroyed by the heavy guns, which continued firing on the canal banks until the last possible moment as 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade stormed the outpost line and then scrambled across the canal in the morning mist. 70th Siege Bty crossed the canal on 1 October to support 32nd Division's attack on the Beaurevoir Line.Blaxland, pp. 232-8.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 101‚Äì6, 133, 139. For the next attack, the Battle of the Selle, IX Corps HQ selected important localities to be bombarded by 70th Siege Bty's heavy howitzers, for which 200 rounds of ammunition per gun were accumulated. The corps attacked on 17 October, 'lifted forward' by two great belts of intense artillery fire, and a German counter-attack was hit by every gun within range.Blaxland, p. 251.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 295, 299‚Äì305.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307‚Äì8. IX Corps renewed its advance on 23 October, with 12th Bde part of a massive corps artillery reserve. The attack went in at 01.20 in moonlight, after the heavy guns had done the usual CB and harassing fire bombardments, and the results were extremely satisfactory.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 352‚Äì61. After a pause to regroup and reconnoitre, IX Corps stormed across the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal on 4 November (the Battle of the Sambre). After that the campaign became a pursuit of a beaten enemy, in which the slow-moving siege guns could play no part. The war ended with the Armistice with Germany on 11 November.Blaxland, pp. 254‚Äì6.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 386‚Äì8, 463‚Äì71.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 318‚Äì20. 70th Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919. Crew positioning a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer in 1918. 108th Siege Battery, RGA 108th Siege Battery was formed in the Forth Defences under Army Council Instruction No 397 of 21 February 1916 with a cadre of three officers and 78 men from the Forth RGA. It went out to the Western Front on 7 June armed with four 6-inch howitzers and also joined 40th HAG in X Corps' Heavy Artillery. It had a similar experience to 70th Siege Bty in the Somme Offensive, although it transferred to 45th HAG on 21 July. For the Capture of Pozi√®res on 23 July, 45th HAG was directly attached to 1st Australian Division. A methodical bombardment of the village began on 19 July, the volume of fire increasing after dark on 22 July. Just before Zero hour (00.30 on 23 July) the heavy artillery provided five minutes of intense bombardment of the western part of the village between the Bapaume road and the cemetery. The Australian battalions attacking the village encountered little resistance and reached their objective before daybreak, though there was bitter fighting elsewhere.Miles, 1916, Vol II, pp. 142‚Äì3. 108th Siege Bty moved to 59th HAG on 29 September, then began a series of rapid changes in command, to 76th HAG with First Army on 23 December, to 50th HAG with Third Army on 26 January 1917, 31st HAG with First Army two days later, then to 53rd HAG on 5 February and 79th HAG on 18 February, joining 87th HAG with Third Army on 26 March before the Battle of Arras. Then it was with 76th HAG, First Army, from 30 April, and back to 50th HAG, Third Army, on 14 May. It remained with 50th HAG during the summer, being rested from 23 August to 7 September. On 25 September 1917, 108th Siege Bty was made up to six howitzers when it was joined by a section from the newly arrived 441st Siege Bty. The battery was briefly assigned to 16th HAG, First Army, on 6 November, but two days later it left to return to 50th HAG with Third Army (a move that took until 12 November) for the Battle of Cambrai. The group fired in support of III Corps' attack. The attack on this front was a complete success, and the German artillery was largely neutralised by the bombardment (later analysis showed that enemy gun positions had been fixed with 90 per cent accuracy).Farndale, Western Front, pp. 220‚Äì4. However, further exploitation was slow, and the fighting bogged down round Bourlon Wood. On 30 November the Germans launched a heavy counter- attack. 108th Siege Bty's guns were sited at Sonnet Farm, alongside 110th Siege Bty (formed by the Clyde RGA at the same time as the 108th). The German barrage on the battery positions lasted half an hour and although 110th Siege Bty managed to get two howitzers into action, the retreating British infantry had passed the batteries' position, and about noon the Germans came over the crest of Gonnelieu Ridge. The gunners removed the dial sights before abandoning their howitzers and those armed with rifles took up a position about 300 yards back. Here they were joined by troops from 60th Infantry Brigade who held the German advance.108th Siege Bty had lost five of its howitzers.Cooper, pp. 178‚Äì80, 194‚Äì7.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 249‚Äì50, 257, Map 33.Miles, 1917, Vol III, p. 197. After this action the battery moved to 86th HAG and was re-equipped, but reduced to an establishment of four guns; a section of gunners left on 24 December to join 288th Siege Bty, an 8-inch howitzer unit that had been broken up and was being reconstituted with 6-inch howitzers. 108th Siege Bty was attached to 17th HAG on 27 December, then moved to 78th HAG two days later. This was its final transfer, and it served with 78th HAG (78th Bde RGA from 1 February 1918) until the Armistice. 78th Brigade served with Third Army during the German Spring Offensive, then transferred to Second Army on 7 July. Second Army joined in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive on 18 August, advancing in Flanders. On 26 and 30 August, during the Battle of the Scarpe, 78th Bde supported the Canadian Corps, with the heavy guns firing ahead of the creeping barrage. For the Canadian attack on the Drocourt-Qu√©ant Switch Line (2 September), the brigade directly supported the attacking divisions while other RGA brigades handled CB tasks.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7.Edmonds, 1918, Vol IV, pp. 306, 365, 398. On 2 October 78th Bde transferred to First Army, supporting XXII Corps at the Battle of the Selle (24 October), after which the pursuit was too fast for most of the heavy artillery to keep up.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, 1918, Vol V, p. 381.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 313‚Äì4. The fighting was ended by the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and 108th Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919. Interwar The Forth RGA was reformed on 1 July 1920. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 the title was changed to Forth Coast Brigade, RGA, and when the RGA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery in 1924 it became the Forth Heavy Brigade, RA. It formed part of the coast defence troops in 52nd (Lowland) Divisional Area and had the following organisation:Titles and Designations 1927. * HQ at Easter Road Barracks, Edinburgh * 160 Heavy Battery at Easter Road Barracks * 161 Heavy Battery at Easter Road Barracks * 162 Heavy Battery at Easter Road Barracks * 163 Heavy Battery at Hunter Street drill hall, Kirkcaldy A 1927 report on coastal defences by the Committee of Imperial Defence made recommendations for defence schemes at 15 'Class A' home ports, including the Forth (Scheme 7), but little was done to modernise them before the outbreak of World War II.Collier, Chapter III.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex B. On 1 April 1934, 160 Hvy Bty converted to the medium artillery role and transferred to 62nd (North Scottish) Medium Brigade, which had been converted from the North Scottish RGA at Broughty Ferry. The battery rejoined Forth Heavy Regiment (as RA brigades were now termed) on 1 November 1938 and reconverted to the coast artillery role.Litchfield, p. 275. World War II Mobilisation The TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis, and in May 1939 163 Batty transferred to join a new Fife Heavy Regiment (later 504th and 507th (Fife) Coast Rgts) on the north bank of the Forth, formed from 62nd (North Scottish) Medium Rgt.Litchfield, p. 284. The Forth Heavy Rgt mobilised in the Lowland Area of Scottish Command on the outbreak of war in September 1939.Scottish Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.

Unlike the anti-aircraft defences of the Forth, these units and batteries saw no action. As the invasion threat receded, the coast defences were seen as absorbing excessive manpower and were scaled back, the gunners being redeployed. The surplus TA coast regiments were placed in suspended animation. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the following units were reformed in 105th Coast Artillery Brigade based in Edinburgh:Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. * 412th (Highland) Coast Rgt at Alness, Cromarty, from 501st (Forth) Coast Rgt * 413th (Fife) Coast Rgt at Kirkcaldy from 503rd (Forth) Coast Rgt * 414th (Forth) Coast Rgt at Edinburgh from 505th (Forth) Coast Regt414‚Äì433 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.

By contrast, Baltimore Design School's stated aim is to provide its students with \\"a solid foundation of design and studio skills followed by intensive academics and design study\\", by completion of four years of study in one of three tracks in architecture-construction design and management, graphic design-interactive media production, or fashion design, followed by three years of CTE training. History The industrial building that would eventually become the Baltimore Design School was built between 1915-1916 as part of the Crown Cork & Seal Co. From there, it passed into the hands of the Lebow Brothers Clothing factory, which occupied the site until 1985, when the building was closed during a labor dispute. After that, the building sat vacant for nearly 30 years. Portions of the abandoned factory were used for scenes in the fourth season of The Wire.

She contributed to various publications including National Geographic, Audubon, Smithsonian, Defenders and The New York Times. She specialized in photographing animals such as beavers and coyotes across North America.  Career  Hope Ryden was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on August 1, 1929, to E. E. Ryden, a Lutheran minister, and Agnes Johnson, an organist and pianist. She studied English at the University of Iowa. While there, she appeared in the educational film A Closed Book alongside Milburn Stone. She later worked for Pan American Airways as a flight attendant, including the company's first transatlantic jet engine powered flight in 1958; she repeated the journey in 1983 on the flight's 25th anniversary. She later recalled: \\"It was the pre-jet days, so layovers on international flights were long. I'd have four or five days at a time in Africa and Asia. My objective was to see the animals of those continents.\\" Ryden left Pan Am in 1961 and worked in freelance photography with documentary and cin√©ma v√©rit√© producer Robert Drew, being the only female member of the organization. She produced her first successful film, Mission to Malaya in 1963, documenting the services of the Peace Corps. Two years later, she produced a film about a mixed-race couple in Virginia, Richard and Mildred Loving, who opposed the state's interracial marriage laws. It was not released to the public until 2011, when it was included in the Emmy Award-winning documentary The Loving Story. After leaving Drew Associates, Ryden worked for the American Broadcasting Company. In 1965, she was sent to Suriname to document the rescue of around 10,000 wild animals from the Upper Suriname River. In 1968, she visited Lovell, Wyoming, documenting a wild horse roundup by the Bureau of Land Management in the Pryor Mountains. Ryden later wrote seven books covering wild horses, beginning with 1970's America's Last Wild Horses. A friend said that Ryden was \\"called on to testify in Washington so many times that she [knew] the senators by their first names.\\" Her testimony helped pass the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, and she participated in its defense when its constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged. In 1972, Ryden released God‚Äôs Dog: A Celebration of the North American Coyote, having camped in remote parts of Wyoming and Montana for two years to observe and photograph the species \\"in an effort to discover the truth behind the ignorance and misinformation that has plagued this much- maligned animal for over 200 years\\". Alongside naturalist John Miller, whom she later married, she studied beavers in Harriman State Park, leading to the book Lily Pond: Four Years with a Family of Beavers (1989). In her late career Ryden returned to documentary film making, producing Cin√©ma V√©rit√©: Defining the Moment (2000) and A President to Remember (2008), about John F. Kennedy. She died on June 18, 2017, in Hyannis, Massachusetts, of complications from hip surgery.  Awards  Ryden earned several awards during her career. These include the Animal Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Animal Protection Institute, the Humane Excellence Award from the ASPCA, and the Joseph Wood Krutch Award from the Humane Society for making a \\"significant contribution toward the improvement of life and environment on the planet\\".

While continuing a largely academic curriculum, the technical origins of the school were maintained, and in 1947 Wandsworth School took over administration of the secondary technical school of the Brixton School of Building. This began the process of the school's expansion that continued in the 1950s.\\"The past in the present at Wandsworth\\". H Raymond King. The Link, School Magazine. July 1970. In the 1957 it became a non-selective boys' Comprehensive School when it merged with Wandsworth Technical College, and became one of the country's first Comprehensive Schools. As part of this change, new buildings were opened on the site's playing fields and the school roll increased from 550 to nearly 2,000. The new buildings included a Planetarium, the first in a British school, a swimming pool and workshops for technical and vocational training. During much of its history Wandsworth School enjoyed continuity of leadership, with only two headmasters in 63 years: Dr H Thwaite from 1900 to 1932, and Mr H. Raymond King from 1932 to 1963. Mr A.

It is located at a distance of circa 250 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 545 is about 180,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on October 1, 1785. It is a member of the Abell 194 galaxy cluster and is included along with NGC 547 in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. A weak radio source with radio jets has been associated with NGC 545. The short jet crosses the much more prominent jet of NGC 547. Observations of the centre of the galaxy by Hubble Space Telescope didn't reveal the presence of dust or disk features. In the centre of the galaxy is believed to exist a supermassive black hole whose mass is estimated to be about 600 million (108.79) based on the stellar tidal disruption rate. NGC 545 forms a pair with the equally bright NGC 547, which lies 0.5 arcminutes away. They share a common envelope,Nilson, P. (1973) Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies, Acta Universitatis Upsalienis, Nova Regiae Societatis Upsaliensis, Series V: A Vol. 1 however, despite their close position, no tidal features like tails or bridges have been observed. A stellar bridge has been detected between the galaxy pair and NGC 541, which lies 4.5 arcminutes to the southwest (projected distance circa 100 kpc). Observations of the galaxy by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory revealed sharp surface brightness edges on the northeastern part of the galaxy and an extended tail in the soft band. It has been presumed that these are the result of motion of NGC 545 towards the centre of the cluster that has been identified as the location of NGC 547.

He was the first Principal of the University College of the West Indies, serving from 1946 to 1952, and then Principal of the University College of the South West of England (later Exeter University) from 1952 until his death in 1953. He had previously been a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford (1920‚Äì1946) and a lecturer in organic chemistry at the University of Oxford (1927‚Äì1946). He saw active service in the British Army during both World Wars. Early life and education Taylor was born on 2 October 1895 in Little Ilford, Essex, England. He was educated at the City of London School, an all-boys independent school in London. Having received a scholarship, he studied chemistry at Brasenose College, Oxford. His university studies were interrupted by military service during the First World War. He returned to Oxford after the war, and graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1920. He was later awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree by the University of Oxford. Military service First World War On 20 April 1915, having trained with the Officers Training Corps, Taylor was commissioned into the Essex Regiment as a second lieutenant (on probation). He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion, Essex Regiment. His commission and rank were confirmed in September 1915. He saw active service on the Western Front in France, and also at Gallipoli. He was wounded twice at Gallipoli. Second World War When the Second World War broke out, Taylor returned to the British Army, and was commissioned as a lieutenant on 14 January 1940. On 12 January 1941, he was assigned to the Royal Engineers and promoted to war substantive captain. He served in its chemical warfare branch, and was posted to the Middle East until 1943. While a temporary major, he was mentioned in despatches \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Middle East during the period November 1941 to April 1942\\". In 1943, Taylor moved to the United States where he had been appointed Director of the British Central Scientific Office (BCSO) in Washington, DC. The role of the BCSO was to undertake varied scientific research in relation to the war, and to cooperate with American scientists. He undertook research as varied as insecticides, paper parachutes, and shark repellents. Then, from 1944 to the end of the war, he was assigned to South East Asia Command as Head of the Operational Research Division. Academic career In 1920, Taylor was elected a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford; his alma mater. In 1927, he was additionally appointed a lecturer in organic chemistry at the University of Oxford. As a researcher he specialised in stereochemistry, but his made his name as an excellent teacher. He was a demonstrator in organic chemistry at the Dyson Perrins Laboratory. Among his students at Brasenose College was William Golding, who would move from studying science to literature and later won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Among those he supervised at Dyson Perrins Laboratory was Rosemary Murray; later Dame Rosemary and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Following the end of the Second World War, Taylor moved into academic administration: he had learnt during the war that he was a very capable administrator. In 1946, he was selected as the first Principal of the University College of the West Indies in Jamaica. His duties involved building up the university college, establishing it in a difficult political climate, and solidifying its finances. He was successful, and was knighted for his efforts in 1952. He left the Caribbean to return to England, where he had been appointed Principal of the University College of the South West of England (later to become the University of Exeter) in July 1952. Personal life In 1922, Taylor married Rosamund Georgina Lloyd. They had no children. On 29 August 1953, Taylor died suddenly while on holiday in Italy: he was 57 years old. Honours On 23 May 1946, Taylor was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \\"for services to the forces\\". In the 1952 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, and therefore granted the title sir, in recognition of his work as Principal of the University College of the West Indies. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during a service at Buckingham Palace on 8 July 1952.

It saw active service on the Western Front at the Somme, Vimy Ridge and Cambrai, against the German Spring Offensive, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive. Mobilisation 70th Siege Battery was formed at Dover under War Office Instruction No 144 of 9 October 1915 from one company (probably 1/4th Company) of the Forth Royal Garrison Artillery, a part-time coast defence unit of the Territorial Force based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The remainder of the personnel were New Army recruits.Frederick, p. 702. The battery went out to the Western Front on 26 March 1916 armed with four 8-inch howitzers. (At this stage of the war the 8-inch howitzers in use (Marks I‚ÄìV) were improvised from cut-down and bored-out barrels of 6-inch coast defence guns, with the recoil checked by enormous wooden wedges.Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, p. 301.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 130, 141.)

The preliminary bombardment programme was to extend over five days, U, V, W, X and Y, before the assault was launched on Z day. The strenuous work of firing the heavy guns and howitzers was divided into 2-hour periods to allow the gunners to rest, Forward Observation Officers (FOOs) to be relieved, and the guns to cool. The bombardment began on 24 June, but on several days the weather was too bad for good air or ground observation and the programme was extended by two days (Y1 and Y2).Edmonds, 1916, Vol I, pp. 299‚Äì305.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 142‚Äì8.

On 36th Division's front the initial assault was entirely successful, except for the area immediately adjacent to the Ancre. The Ulstermen overran the German front line trenches and dugouts, and by 08.00 they had captured the front face of the Schwaben Redoubt. They were ordered not to continue the attack, because the divisions on either flank had met with disaster, and this allowed the defenders to get into their rear. The reserve brigade had already gone on, however, and although some parties got into the German 2nd Position, the remainder were pinned down in the open. Communications had broken down so the artillery could do little to help. The partial success of 36th Division was not supported, and German counter-attacks made the position in the Schwaben untenable: the surviving troops were withdrawn in good order after dark. The artillery helped to evacuate the wounded, a process that was not completed until 3 July.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 398, 403‚Äì8, 416‚Äì21. The Somme Offensive continued, with some success for X Corps on 14 July (the Battle of Bazentin Ridge), 17 July (the Capture of Ovillers) and 23 July (the Capture of Pozi√®res. The front was then reorganised, with Reserve Army (later Fifth Army) taking over the sector from Fourth Army and X Corps HQ handing over to II Corps.Farndale, Western Front, p. 149.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 139‚Äì43.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1. There as no respite for the gunners: II Corps continued the Battle of Pozi√®res Ridge until early September and was then engaged in the battles of Flers-Courcelette (15‚Äì22 September) and Thiepval Ridge (26‚Äì28 September), with the heavy guns increasingly concentrated to help the infantry advance.Farndale, Western Front, pp 150‚Äì4. On 3 October 70th Siege Bty transferred to 16th HAG, still with Fifth Army, which continued to attack on the Ancre Heights until mid-November, and minor operations there through the winter.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 114‚Äì20.Farndale, Western Front, pp 154‚Äì6. Vimy On 22 March 1917, 70th Siege Bty moved north to join 31st HAG with First Army, which was preparing for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. 31st HAG was assigned to I Corps with its batteries firing from around Bully Grenay on the extreme north flank of the attack, from where they could virtually enfilade the German lines. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised counter-battery (CB) fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the heavy howitzers fired further ahead to hit the rear areas on the reverse slope of the ridge, especially known gun positions. The attack went in on 9 April with I Corps and Canadian Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge while Third Army attacked further south near Arras. The only hold-up on 9 April was at Hill 145, near the north end of the Canadian attack, and the capture of this position was completed the next day. Fighting in the southern sector (the Battle of Arras) continued into May.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8. 70th Siege Bty came under the command of 15th HAG on 11 May 1917, and on 29 May it was joined by a section from the newly- arrived 310th Siege Bty, bringing it up to a strength of six 8-inch howitzers. It transferred again to 54th HAG on 23 June while First Army was engaged around Oppy Wood, then to 63rd HAG on 4 July and finally to 12th HAG with Third Army on 7 September.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì8. Cambrai 8-inch Howitzer at almost full recoil. In October, Third Army began preparing for its surprise attack with tanks at the Battle of Cambrai. There was to be no preliminary bombardment or registration shots, and the guns were to open fire at Zero hour firing 'off the map' at carefully surveyed targets. Third Army HQ stressed that even a single 8-inch howitzer 'would frequently be the quickest and always the least expensive way of expelling the enemy from a village or strong point which could not be by-passed'. Farndale, Western Front, pp. 216‚Äì21, Map 32. Miles, 1917, Vol III, pp. 26, 29. When the battle began with a crash of artillery at 06.20 on 20 November the German defenders were stunned, and the massed tanks completed their overcome. In most areas the attack was an outstanding success. Exploitation over succeeding days was less spectacular, though some bombardments were set up to help the infantry take certain villages.Cooper, pp. 85‚Äì8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 221‚Äì30. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. Because of the inclusion of 70th Siege Bty the 12th Brigade was defined as an 8-inch Howitzer Brigade, though the other three batteries were all equipped with 6-inch howitzers. 70th Siege Bty remained with this brigade until the Armistice.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. 1918 12th Brigade was in General Headquarters (GHQ) Reserve from 4 January to 11 February 1918. Thereafter it was assigned to the reconstituted Second Army. Becke, Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7. The brigade was part of IX Corps' Heavy Artillery in the fighting at Mont Kemmel, during the Battle of the Lys (the second phase of the German Spring Offensive) in April 1918.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 187‚Äì91.Edmonds, 1918, Vol II, p. 410. It then moved to Fourth Amy on 18 August 1918 in time for the Battle of Amiens and then to participate in the victorious Hundred Days Offensive. By the end of September Fourth Army had closed up to the Hindenburg Line. 12th Brigade came under the command of IX Corps once more for Fourth Army's assault crossing of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September. The canal defences had largely been destroyed by the heavy guns, which continued firing on the canal banks until the last possible moment as 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade stormed the outpost line and then scrambled across the canal in the morning mist. The objectives were taken by 15.30 and 70th Siege Bty moved forwards to new positions before the end of the day. It crossed over the canal after dawn on 1 October to support 32nd Division's attack on the Beaurevoir Line the following day.Blaxland, pp. 232-8.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 101‚Äì6, 133, 139. It took a week for Fourth Army to bring up its heavy guns and ammunition for its next attack (the Battle of the Selle). 12th Brigade was still with IX Corps HQ, who selected important localities to be bombarded by 70th Siege Bty's heavy howitzers, for which 200 rounds of ammunition per gun were accumulated. IX Corps attacked on 17 October, 'lifted forward' by two great belts of intense and heavy artillery fire leapfrogging forward, and an attempted German counter-attack was hit by every gun within range. When the infantry were brought to a halt by machine gun fire, the guns were being moved forwards, but a new barrage was improvised and they ended the day over looking the Selle valley.Blaxland, p. 251.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 295, 299‚Äì305.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 307‚Äì8. IX Corps renewed its advance on 23 October, with 12th Bde part of a massive corps artillery reserve. The attack went in at 01.20 in moonlight, after the heavy guns had done the usual CB and harassing fire (HF) bombardments, and the results were extremely satisfactory.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 352‚Äì61. As the regimental historian relates, \\"The guns of Fourth Army demonstrated, on 23rd October, the crushing effect of well co- ordinated massed artillery. They simply swept away the opposition\\".Farndale, Western Front, pp. 311‚Äì2. After a pause to regroup and reconnoitre, IX Corps stormed across the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal on 4 November (the Battle of the Sambre). After that the campaign became a pursuit of a beaten enemy, in which the slow- moving siege guns could play no part. The war ended with the Armistice with Germany on 11 November.Blaxland, pp. 254‚Äì6.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 386‚Äì8, 463‚Äì71.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 318‚Äì20. 70th Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919.

William Sharp (1855‚Äì1905) was her first cousin, his father David was a younger brother of Thomas, Elizabeth's father. They had no children. Life Elizabeth was the daughter of Thomas Sharp and Agnes Farquharson, daughter of Robert Farquharson, sometime provost of Paisley. Her brother was Robert Farquharson Sharp (1864‚Äì1945) who became Keeper of Printed Books in the British Museum. In 1863 Elizabeth first met William when her mother brought her children on holiday from London to Blairmore on Gare Loch western Scotland. Elizabeth next met William in August 1875 when he spent a week with her family at Dunoon on the Clyde. In September 1875 Elizabeth and her sister visited William's family in Glasgow and by the end of the month, Elizabeth and William were secretly engaged. In 1876 the two Sharp families rented houses on the Dunoon but this holiday finished in August of that year when William's father died. William left for Australia following fears for his health and returned to London in 1877. Elizabeth introduced him to her friends: Adelaide Elder and Mona Alison who later married James Alexander Henryson-Caird. In 1878 Elizabeth and William announced their engagement. In 1880 Elizabeth and her mother rented a holiday cottage in Port Maddock in northern Wales. William visited and caught a severe cold which became rheumatic fever. Elizabeth and her mother nursed him but over the course of their marriage Elizabeth would spend large parts nursing William. In 1884 Elizabeth married William after a nine-year courtship. Elizabeth and William rented a flat at 46 Talgarth Road in West Kensington. They expanded their circle of literary and artistic friends, which would include William Morris and his wife Jane Burden, Oscar Wilde and his wife Constance Lloyd, Ford Madox Ford and his wife Elsie Martindale. By the end of 1884 Elizabeth and William embarked on six-year stint of editing. In 1885 Elizabeth and William travelled to Oxford first and then to Scotland where in July they rented a cottage at Loch Tarbert. In 1887 the Sharps moved from their West Kensington flat to a larger house in South Hampstead which they rented for three years and called Wescam. In late 1887 Elizabeth brought William to the Isle of Wight to recover from inflammation of the lungs. From 1888 the Sharps held Sunday evening 'at homes' for their literary and artistic circle at Wescam. In August 1888 Elizabeth and William went to Scotland for nearly three months visiting family. In July 1889 Elizabeth accompanied Mona Caird to Valdes in the Carpathian mountains. In the summer of 1890 Elizabeth visited a friend in South Bantaskine and then met William in North Queensferry to travel to Aberdeen and back to Edinburgh to meet family. In October 1890 Elizabeth and William went to Heidelberg for six weeks and then to Italy for the winter staying first with Elizabeth's aunt, Mrs Smiley, who had a villa near Florence and then to Rome staying until early March 1891. By 1890 Elizabeth's and William's marriage had devolved to that of a mother looking after a child. In Rome William began a relationship with Edith Wingate Rinder which last until his death. Elizabeth acknowledges the relationship and the effect it had on her husband's creativity partially prompting the creation of 'Fiona MacLeod' in her Memoir. Upon leaving Rome they travelled to Provence where Elizabeth stayed until mid-1891, leaving only when she became ill with a low fever, identified as malaria, and returning to Eastbourne. In late 1891 Elizabeth and William visited Stuttgart so William could collaborate with Blanche Willis Howard. In early 1892 the Sharps had moved to 11 Bedford Gardens in Kensington where Elizabeth had a studio for painting however by mid-April William had left for Paris and Elizabeth remained in England. Elizabeth joined William in Paris in early May by which time Edith Wingate Rinder had left. In June 1892 while staying with Mona Caird Elizabeth had a malaria relapse and William travelled to Bucks Green, Sussex to secure a cottage where they would stay for the next two years. They named the house 'Phenice Croft' combining the Greek name for a 'phoenix' with the Scottish word for 'cottage.' During July 1892 Elizabeth travelled to Bayreuth for the Wagner festival. In late 1893 because of Elizabeth's relapses from malaria, the Sharps travelled to Italy and North Africa returning in February 1893. In May 1893 Elizabeth travelled to Paris to review the art salon for the Glasgow Herald and at the end of July both Sharps went to St Andrews and Perthshire in Scotland. From the summer of 1893 Elizabeth spent more time in London with her mother as attributed her continuing health problems to the moist air and clay soil of Bucks Green and having to regularly travel to London for her art critic commitments. It's likely with Elizabeth in London that Edith Wingate Rinder spent these periods at Bucks Green.[11] At this time William also undertook psychic experiments and Elizabeth felt they had a negative impact on his mental health. From 1894 the Sharps rented a flat at Kensington Court Gardens where Elizabeth lived while William travelled between London and Bucks Green. In late 1894 the Sharps let the Bucks Green house go. In the summer of 1894 Elizabeth and William spent six weeks in Scotland visiting Oban, the Isle of Mull and Iona. In 1895 Elizabeth and William intended to spend part of the summer in Edinburgh at Patrick Geddes Summer School where William would give a series of lectures. However, William had an attack of angina and the majority of the lectures were never delivered. William left for Kinghorn to recuperate while Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh keeping opening house for the students. In 1896 both Elizabeth and William contributed to Patrick Geddes' The Evergreen: A Northern Seasonal. Elizabeth and Patrick had concerns about William's health and at this point Patrick offered him salaried work with his publishing company. In 1896 Patrick Geddes published Lyra Celtica: An Anthology of Representative Celtic Poetry as part of his 'Celtic Library' series. Later that year on orders from her doctor Elizabeth left to spend three months in a warm climate in Italy. Elizabeth travelled with William as far as Paris, met her aunt in Florence and then met Mona Caird in Rome. By mid-1896 Elizabeth and Edith were in agreement about William's health and agreed that one or the other of them, or a suitable substitute should always be present with him. Towards the end of 1896 Elizabeth and William became godparents to Patrick Geddes' son Arthur Allhallows Geddes. In 1897 Elizabeth met some members of the F√©librige: Felix Gras, Frederic Mistral and Marie Josephine Gasquet (b.1872) and author of Une Fille de Saint Fran√ßois (1922), Une Enfance Proven√ßale (1926‚Äì41), Sainte Jeanne d‚ÄôArc (1929), and La F√™te-Dieu (1932). Mistral had co-founded the F√©librige some years earlier in an effort to preserve Proven√ßal culture. By 1898 Elizabeth was focused on her work as an art critic and on restoring her husband's physical and mental health. Throughout the Memoir she never revealed concerns about the extent of Edith's relationship with William but welcomed her co-operation in stabilising his health. William and Elizabeth decided to go in August and September 1899 to the east coast of Ireland as it was less expensive than the west coast. Before they left for Ireland they gave up their South Hampstead flat at 30 Greencroft Gardens. In 1900 Elizabeth was beset by both bronchitis and rheumatism, which was followed by sciatica. In 1901 Elizabeth and William visited Palermo and Taormina. In 1902 Elizabeth was obliged to give up her work as an art critic, despite the income that it brought in, as William was sick. In November 1904 Elizabeth and William visited America and Carolyn Hazard, President of Wellesley College, arranged for Elizabeth Sharp to tour Wellesley and Radcliffe College, and for both Sharps to call on Julia Ward Howe and to visit Fen Hall to see Isabella Stewart Gardner's collection. Fen Hall is now known as Fenway Court and is the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. This was Elizabeth's first visit to the US. In December 1905 William died while staying with Elizabeth and their friend Alexander Nelson Hood at his Castello Maniace near Mount Etna in Sicily. After William's death in 1905, Elizabeth consulted mediums and left a record of her communications with his spirit. Elizabeth became literary executor of William's estate after his death. After his death Elizabeth compiled and arranged many of William's works under a uniform title of 'Selected Writings of William Sharp.' This five-volume set comprised Poems, Critical Essays, Papers (covering two volumes) and Vistas. The title page describes these books as 'selected and arranged by Mrs William Sharp.' In these volumes, Elizabeth wrote a preface discussing the contents of each volume and the selection choices made. When Elizabeth died in 1932 she left instructions for two packages to be destroyed which they were. These may have included William's Golden Dawn diaries or letters between William and Edith Wingate Rinder. Writer Elizabeth Sharp published books on poetry, art and music history, and translated Heine. Elizabeth and William collaborated to some extent, most notably on Lyra Celtica: An Anthology of Representative Celtic Poetry. Lyra Celtica is an anthology of poetry from all the Celtic nations. It includes ancient Scottish, Irish, Cornish, Manx and Breton poems as well as works by contemporary Scottish and Irish poets including Fiona MacLeod, Katharine Tynan, WB Yeats, Bliss Carman, Villiers de I'Isle-Adam and Arthur Quiller Couch. Elizabeth contributed significantly to the selection and arrangement of sonnets in William's book Sonnets of This Century (1886). In 1887 Elizabeth assisted William when he took over the editor of 'The Literary Chair' in The Young Folk's Paper. In 1890 William transferred the post of London-based art critic for the Glasgow Herald to Elizabeth. In 1899 Elizabeth was also an art critic for a London newspaper. In 1892 J Stanley Little wrote a favourable review of Elizabeth's translation of Heine: \\"She has absorbed Heine and given him back etc.\\" In 1896 Elizabeth contributed to Patrick Geddes' The Evergreen: A Northern Seasonal.

Hayles was born at Andover, Hampshire. He was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, before attending the Royal Military Academy. He graduated from the academy in August 1936 and was posted to the Royal Corps of Signals as a second lieutenant, with promotion to lieutenant coming in August 1939. In the year prior to his promotion to lieutenant, Hayles played two first-class cricket matches as a wicket-keeper for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Fenner's, and Oxford University at Camberley. He played a further first-class match for the Army in 1939 against Cambridge University. He served during the Second World War, during which he was promoted to the rank of captain in August 1944. Following the war, Hayles played first-class cricket for the Combined Services cricket team, making two appearances in 1947 against the touring South Africans at Portsmouth, and Oxford University at Oxford. He also played minor counties cricket for Norfolk in the same year. He these up with two further first-class appearances in 1949 against Hampshire at Aldershot, and Kent at Gillingham.

Biography Gregory was the firstborn son of the powerful lord Ivan K≈ëszegi.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 4. K≈ëszegi [and Rohonci] branch) He had a sister, who married a certain Dominic and a brother John the Wolf, who was presumably born after Gregory's death, and integrated into the Austrian nobility. He also had a stepbrother from his father's extramarital affair, Nicholas (born 1282), who entered ecclesiastical career and elevated into the dignity of Bishop of Gy≈ër. Gregory had two sons from his unidentified wife: Nicholas III and Andrew, who were still minors during his death and inherited their grandfather's wealth and power after 1308. The future Andrew III came to Hungary for the first time in 1278 at the invitation of Ivan K≈ëszegi, who wanted to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Andrew achieved nothing, and went back to Venice in autumn. Gregory K≈ëszegi was first referred to as the Master of the stewards in the virtual ducal court of Andrew in 1287. During the reign of Andrew III, who ascended the Hungarian throne in 1290, K≈ëszegi served as isp√°n of Zala County in 1291. Shortly after the signing of Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the brief war between Hungary and Austria and prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from them, K≈ëszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Charles Martel of Anjou, as King of Hungary. His father Charles II of Naples donated Vas and Sopron counties to Ivan and his son Gregory. In September 1296, Gregory was styled as isp√°n Garics (Podgaric) and Gerzence (Gare≈°nica) lordships by a contemporary document. In the next year, the two forts were handed over to the Diocese of Zagreb. Gregory shared his father's political orientation in order to establish their independent province at the borderlands between Austria and Hungary. According to Austrian chronicles and annals, he actively participated in the various plundering campaigns and raids against the two realms. The Continuatio Vindobonensis described Gregory as a \\"very bad man, the most worthless robber\\", thus, as the chronicle noted, \\"it is not surprising\\" that he was killed by a lightning strike in 1297.

It is believed that Arai - despite his talents as an animator - stopped creating films soon after World War II because of Tobiishi's untimely death.

With two colleagues, as the firm Heinz & Mathoi & Streli, he built private homes in the alpine landscape of Tyrol, schools, offices and public buildings, among others. He was also president of the architecture section of the Ingenieur- und Architektenkammer f√ºr Tirol und Vorarlberg.  Life and career  Streli was born in Innsbruck. He studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule Wien from 1958 to 1964. After several years of practice, he became assistant at the Innsbruck University in 1969, a post he held until 1976. He lectured at the university from 1992 to 1997. Floor plan for Landesjugendheim in Jagdberg, Schlins From 1973, Streli collaborated with two colleagues, Karl Heinz and Dieter Mathoi, as the firm Heinz & Mathoi & Streli. While they created many buildings jointly, each architect also pursued his own projects. Together, they built a chapel in 1982, the Sankt-Margarethen-Kapelle in Innerberg, which rises like a tower on a circular floor. They built a home for homeless children as a Gruppenwohnheim (group home) with four separate units, completed in Jagdberg, Vorarlberg, in 1984. Streli focused on one-family homes, with respect for the owners' wishes and the natural surroundings. Inspired by models such as Clemens Holzmeister, , , and Frank Lloyd Wright, he found his own style. He departed from his love of nature and of traditional building in rural landscape, with wood as a preferred material, but changed toward urban environments. He renovated the interior of the old parish church in H√∂tting in 1989, and built a new parish hall there in 1994. Extension of the University Hospital Innsbruck, completed 2008 The joint extension of the University Hospital in Innsbruck, created by adding a technical and a clinical floor for gynecology and neurology on top, built from 2006 to 2008, was nominated for the award of the Fundaci√≥ Mies van der Rohe in 2009. In 2008, Springer published a monograph of their works, both group and individual projects, titled Heinz-Mathoi-Streli / Architekten / Bauten und Projekte / Buildings and Projects, with evaluations by Friedrich Achleitner and . The same year, the architects dissolved their firm. In 2015, Streli built a home for drug addicts in Innsbruck, called Mentlvilla, designed in reference to Welzenbacher's Adambr√§u, which is now the home of the Architecture Centre of Tyrol. The house (Haus f√ºr Suchtkranke), run by the Caritas, offers housing and medical treatment. It was nominated for the architecture prize of Tyrol in 2016. From 1983 to 1994, Streli was also president of the architecture section of the Ingenieur- und Architektenkammer f√ºr Tirol und Vorarlberg. He served on an advisory board for the city development of Linz from 1993 to 1995. Works by Streli were part of the exhibition Autochtone Architektur in Tirol presenting the architecture of Tyrol with respect for the alpine landscape, in Munich in 1994. He served on juries for architectural competitions, such as for a new University Square in Bolzano in 2014. J√∂rg Streli died in Innsbruck on 13 February 2019.

She is known for the development of ecofeminist thinking. Among her main publications is Ecofeminismo para otro mundo posible (Ecofeminism for Another Possible World; 2011). Biography Alicia Puleo holds a PhD in Philosophy from the Complutense University of Madrid and is a Profesora Titular (associate professor) of Moral and Political Philosophy at the University of Valladolid. She is a member of the latter university's Council of the Chair of Gender Studies, and of the Council of the Complutense University's . She directed the Chair of Gender Studies at the University of Valladolid for a decade (2000‚Äì2010) and has coordinated several seminars at the Feminist Research Institute, including the Discurso sobre la sexualidad y cr√≠tica feminista (Discourse on Feminist Sexuality and Criticism) and Feminismo y ecolog√≠a (Feminism and Ecology). Puleo has combined her teaching career with research and the publication of numerous books and articles on inequality between men and women, gender, and feminism. She was a finalist for the for the book Dial√©ctica de la sexualidad. G√©nero y sexo en la Filosof√≠a Contempor√°nea (Dialectic of Sexuality: Gender and Sex in Contemporary Philosophy; 1992). In 2004, she coordinated editing of the book Mujeres y Ecolog√≠a: Historia, Pensamiento, Sociedad (Women and Ecology: History, Thought, Society), which included the relationship between the environmental movement and the feminist movement and different experiences in Spain and the international arena. In 2011 Puleo published Ecofeminismo para otro mundo posible (Ecofeminism for Another Possible World), a work in which in addition to collecting the history of ecofeminism and analyzing the contributions of the feminist movement to the environmental, not always recognized, she develops her proposal of what she has called a critical or enlightened ecofeminism. In September 2014 she assumed the direction of the publisher Editorial C√°tedra's Feminism Collection. In 2015, she published the collective book Ecolog√≠a y g√©nero en di√°logo interdiciplinar (Gender and Ecology in Interdisciplinary Dialogue), in which the socio-cultural frameworks that weave relationships between bodies and the ecosystems they inhabit are analyzed. Gender inequality Puleo's work is articulated around the concern for inequality between men and women. She analyzes the socio-cultural mechanisms that prevent overcoming this inequality and the means that feminist philosophy offers to defuse them. In some of her studies on the French Enlightenment she examines the roots of this pending subject of modern democracies. The works dedicated to the evolution of the concept of sexuality in Arthur Schopenhauer's contemporary philosophy to Georges Bataille are configured as a critique of the legitimizing theories of violence to which she has referred with the concept of \\"transgressive eroticism\\". Her work has bridged the gap between different currents in feminist theory. In her essay \\"For a Better World: Alicia Puleo's Critical Ecofeminism\\", UCLA professor Roberta Johnson writes, \\"In moving beyond the polarizing division between equality and difference feminism that has characterized Spanish feminist theory in the 1980s and 1990s, Puleo has found ways to combine equality feminism's reason and difference feminism's affect.\\" Ecofeminism Puleo is recognized as one of the most relevant ecofeminist thinkers today. Roberta Johnson characterizes her as \\"arguably Spain's most prominent explicator- philosopher of the worldwide movement or theoretical orientation known as ecofeminism.\\" Puleo's proposal of what she has called a critical or enlightened ecofeminism can be considered a new nonessentialist form of environmental ethics in terms of gender. She does not consider that women are in a kind of symbiosis with nature, but is of the conviction that we live in an era of unsustainable growth that makes the link between feminism and ecology inevitable. She maintains that the mutual enrichment of both perspectives would allow building a culture of equality and sustainability.

During the 2000s and 2010s, the ship‚Äîwhich was engaged in a far-reaching campaign of illegal fishing‚Äîwas one of Interpol's most wanted ships. The Andrey Dolgov was captured and detained by the Indonesian navy in April 2018; the Indonesian government now intends to refurbish the ship and incorporate it into Indonesia's fisheries enforcement fleet.  Description   History  Andrey Dolgov is a steel-hulled fishing vessel. Despite gill nets being found on-board, the ship may have operated as a fish carrier. The ship was built in Shimizu-ku Japan in 1985 for the Maruha Nichiro Corporation, and was intended for the tuna trade. The ship served for years with the Japanese fishing fleet before being acquired by a number of fishing concerns; her last legal owners were registered in South Korea. As of 2008, Andrey operated as an illegal fishing vessel. Sailing under a number of names, the ship frequently engaged in illegal fishing operations in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans. If threatened with the approach of law enforcement, Andrey would flee for international waters, where most national navies and law enforcement had no legal jurisdiction. The ship would unload its catches in a number of Asian countries, and would often miss-report the type of fish being offloaded to avoid sanctions. At some point between 2008 and 2015, the ship was reconfigured so that it could it take part in the lucrative illegal toothfish fishery. The ship changed its country of registry regularly, and flew several national flags. The ship would reportedly bring in around $6 million worth of catch per trip. In 2016, authorities in China found illegally-caught toothfish being unloaded from the ship; however, before an investigation could commence, the ship fled China and sailed for the Indian Ocean. In light of this event, the now-wanted ship was listed as IUU‚Äîa label applied to ships believed to be involved in unreported and unregulated fishing. Later in 2016, Andrey Dolgov and her crew tried to dock in Mauritius but were denied entry. In 2017, the ship (now renamed Sea Breez 1 and flying the flag of Togo) moved from port to port, often using forged documents to deceive authorities. When Togo stuck the ship from its registry, the vessel's name was changed to Ayda. It also intermittently flew the flags of eight nations (some of which had denounced and de-registered the ship) in an effort to confuse authorities. In January 2018, Interpol issued a Purple Notice in regard to the ship, indicating it was wanted for illegal and unregulated fishing. In February 2018, the wanted ship was detected when it docked in Madagascar. Local authorities alerted CCAMLR (a multinational body responsible for enforcing edicts made via the Antarctic Treaty System) after it was discovered that the ship in port (which was operating using the name STS-50) was using a fake International Marine Organization number and was in possession of forged documents. However, attempts to detain the rogue vessel failed and Andrey Dolgov was able to evade capture. Following Andrey's escape from Madagascar, attempts were made to track the vessel via a transponder the ship was using to communicate with the international Vessel Traffic Service. The service, which uses the Automatic identification system (AIS) to track the location of thousands of ships, is normally used to help ships navigate and avoid collisions. It was hoped that, by finding the outlaw fisher's locations via its AIS-linked transponder, the ship could be tracked, pursued, and captured. However, it was found that Andrey Dolgov was producing (described as \\"spoofing\\" by one source) a number of fake signatures. According to OceanMind, a non-profit assisting in the hunt for the Andrey Dolgov, the wanted ship was able to simultaneously appear near the Falklands Islands, Fiji, and Norway. At some points, the method used by the ship caused its signature to appear in nearly 100 places at once. Andrey Dolgov (now operating under the name F/V STS-50) was next spotted near Maputo, Mozambique in March 2018. While the ship was anchored in Maputo Bay, she was successfully detained by Mozambican authorities after her documents were found to be forgeries. The ship's crew was briefly taken into custody, and their passports seized. However, her crew was able to regain control of Andrey Dolgov and successfully escaped the Mozambicans.  Capture  Following the third escape of the Andrey Dolgov, several African countries and international organizations began a concerted effort to hunt down the outlaw ship. At the request of Mozambique, Fish-i Africa (a multinational anti-illegal fishing force comprising 8 East African nations) dispatched ships to search for Andrey Dolgov, while a number of non-profit organizations and Interpol lent their support to find the ship. Eventually the ship was picked up on radar (which was then cross-referenced with AIS pings to determine the Andrey Dolgov's location), and the fleeing vessel was soon being pursued by the Sea Shepherd's MY Ocean Warrior and the Tanzanian navy. After a three-week pursuit across the Indian Ocean, Andrey Dolgov fled into the territorial waters of the Seychelles, forcing the Tanzanian ships to turn back as they did not have the legal jurisdiction to board a vessel in those waters. However, the Tanzanians and Sea Shepherd were able to record information about Andrey Dolgov's speed and heading; this data was passed onto other groups following the chase and eventually forwarded to the Indonesian navy. As the ship continued to flee eastward, she entered the shipping-crowded Strait of Malacca. There, Andrey Dolgov's AIS signal was lost among the hundreds of other signals being generated by other ships in the area. However, the Indonesian navy was able to use the data collected by the outlaws pursuers to coordinate an effort to find the ship; Susi Pudjiastuti, Indonesia's Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, gave the order to intercept the ship. On 6 April 2018, Andrey Dolgov was captured by the Indonesian patrol boat KRI Simeulue 2, which made visual contact with and intercepted the Andrey Dolgov 60 miles off the coast of Weh Island. The ship was stopped and her crew detained, ending the hunt for the Andrey Dolgov. Upon their capture, the 20-man crew of the Andrey Dolgov were found to be from three nations; the captain and six officers were either Russian or Ukrainian, while 14 crew were Indonesian. Many of the Indonesians said they did not know the vessel was operating illegally, and the Indonesian government noted that the men were likely forced laborers. The seizure of the ship's logs revealed that the ship was registered to Red Star Company Ltd, a company based in Belize; a tracking of bank accounts connected to the ship indicated to Interpol that the ship was tied to organized crime in Russia.  Future  Having captured the rogue ship, the Indonesian government had the option to destroy or maintain possession of the vessel as a prize. The Indonesian government elected to maintain the ship. As of February 2019, the ship is expected to join the Indonesian fisheries enforcement fleet.

London: Routledge, P. 293. https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203209011  History  The business of equipment leasing in Nigeria dates back to the early years of Nigerian independence in the early 1960s, however, such transactions were mostly conducted between British firms and their Nigerian subsidiaries. In the late 1960s, new regulations encouraged local participation which provided the platform for two local financial service firms Benthworth Finance, part of John Holt and NAL Merchant bank to offer leasing services. The industry then went through a period of gradual but slow growth with services provided by merchant banks, which were few in the 1970s. By 1983, six merchant banks offering such services decided to form an association to protect their interest in equipment leasing, to raise awareness about the industry and stimulate growth within the industry. Membership was subsequently extended to the leading corporate leasing firms, Leventis Technical, John Holt and Bank of Industry. In 1988, it was formally incorporated with the federal government. The association engages the public through seminars, publications, workshops and training classes.  Objectives  * To act as an umbrella organization representing the interest of members in their relationship with other trade associations, public agencies and governments * Provide and disseminate information on matters concerning the leasing industry. * Promote best business practices  Activities  As part of its mission to raise awareness about the leasing market, the organization published a quarterly newsletter titled Leasing in Nigeria, it also hold seminars and training sessions.

Most recently the campaign manager for Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, Shakir previously worked as an aide to Congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, was an editor-in-chief of the ThinkProgress blog, and was the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Raised in Florida by Pakistani immigrants, Shakir is a progressive liberal and an advocate for Muslim American communities. Early life and education The son of Pakistani immigrants to the United States, Shakir was born and raised in Florida. Shakir completed his B.A. in government at Harvard University, and played on the Harvard Crimson baseball team for four years. Shakir earned a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University. Career After graduating from law school, Shakir worked as a communications aide in the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and as a legislative aide to Senator Bob Graham. He also worked on the John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign as a junior staffer. In 2005, Shakir began working for the Center for American Progress as a policy adviser. There, he helped launch the ThinkProgress blog in 2005, of which he was the editor-in-chief from 2007 to 2012. In 2012, Shakir became House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi's director of new media. During that time, he was involved in advocacy for Muslim-American communities. After that, he served as a senior adviser to Democratic Senate Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. Reid's former deputy chief of staff commented, \\"Reid did not make a big decision without consulting Faiz. There's no one he trusted more on how the progressive community would react on something and no one whose advice he took more seriously on pushing him to the left.\\" Shakir informally advised Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, which drew the ire of the Hillary Clinton campaign team. According to the Podesta emails, Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta chided Shakir for advising Sanders. \\"Gave him a very hard time,\\" Podesta wrote to Neera Tanden about Shakir's involvement. \\"I have to say this does not go down easy with me.\\" Faiz is the first Muslim person to manage a presidential campaign. Shakir joined the American Civil Liberties Union as its political director in January 2017. In March, he helped the ACLU launch the People Power website, which engages volunteers to mobilize in defence of civil liberties. Shakir had first pitched the idea for such a website to ACLU Director Anthony Romero in 2015; at that time, Romero had dismissed the idea as too radical. The website attracted 225,000 volunteers in eight weeks, coordinating projects such as meetings with judges to film screenings to panels on law enforcement and immigration. Upon joining Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign in February 2019, Shakir became the first Muslim and first Pakistani-American campaign manager for a major party U.S. presidential campaign. He and Roger Lau (who worked for Elizabeth Warren's campaign) share the distinction of being the first Asian-Americans to serve as campaign manager for a major American presidential candidate.

It is found on the Pacific coast of North America at depths down to about . Description The central disc is pentagonal and up to in diameter. It has a somewhat inflated appearance and is scattered with small plates on the aboral (upper) side, with larger plates close to the paired radial shields at the base of the arms (rays). The five slender arms taper to a point and consist of a number of articulated joints each topped by an oval plate wider than it is long. There is a curved spine on this plate and three slightly flattened spines projecting laterally on either side of each joint on the arm. The length of each arm is from 12 to 21 times the diameter of the disc. The color of this brittle star is grayish-brown or reddish-brown, with a paler patch at the outer end of the radial shields. Distribution and habitat Amphiodia urtica is native to the west coast of North America, its range extending from Alaska to Mexico. Although it can occur intertidally, it is more often in the subtidal zone at depths down to about . It occurs on muddy bottoms where it immerses itself in the sediment, raising its arms into the water above to catch food particles floating by. On the continental shelf it can occur in large numbers. Ecology This brittle star is predated by flatfish such as sole as well as by sand stars. The arms are most vulnerable and often get torn off or damaged, and both the arms and the aboral surface of the disc can be regenerated. The sexes are separate in this species, which commonly lives for five years. A polychaete worm, Malmgreniella lunulata, sometimes lives on the arms and a copepod sometimes inhabits the stomach.

Acta, 32, 1175-1186, doi:10.1002/hlca.19490320403. 461x461px The double cyanomethylation of Œ≤-alanine as starting material provides with methanal and alkali cyanides and subsequent hydrolysis of the intermediately formed bis- methyl cyanides followed by acidification with mineral acids Œ≤-ADA (N-(2-carboxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid) in yields of only 80%, but very high purity of 99.8%. 907x907px The cyanoethylation of iminodiacetic acid with 2-propenenitrile by a Michael addition provides the ethyl cyano compound, which produces after alkaline hydrolysis and acidification Œ≤-ADA with a total yield of 93.6% and purity of 99.9% . 748x748px In the analogue reaction with acrylic acid esters, 99.9% Œ≤-ADA are obtained after acidification in a total yield of 97.6%. The most direct route is via the Michael addition of acrylic acid to iminodiacetic acid, which produces the trisodium salt of Œ≤-ADA in 97% yield and 99.2% purity. The conversion to Œ≤-ADA itself is not described in this patent specification. The most economical synthesis route is based on iminodiacetic acid, which is easily accessible by oxidizing diethanolamine and serves as a key raw material for the herbicide glyphosate.  Properties  N-(2-Carboxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid is a colourless solid that was shown to be very well degradable in sewage plant simulations (98% after eight weeks) and to be exceptionally low in toxicity. Elsewhere, the poor microbial degradability and adsorbability of Œ≤-ADA is pointed out.Hessisches Landesamt f√ºr Umwelt und Geologie, 6.12 Komplexbildner, S. 12/3, 2003. The contradictory assessment of the degradability of Œ≤-ADA, the weaker complex formation compared to the (rapidly biodegradable) methylglycine diacetic acid (MGDA, Trilon M) and the lower stability in wide temperature and pH ranges have substantially contributed to the breakthrough of MGDA as the most suitable substitute for EDTA.Environmental Protection Agency, DfE's Safer Chemical Ingredients List, Chelating Agents, Alanine, N,N-bis(carboxymethyl)-, sodium salt (1:3).  Use  Like other complexing agents from the class of aminopolycarboxylic acids, N-(2-carboxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid is used in water softening, in detergents and cleaning agents, in electroplating, cosmetics, paper and textile production. This is based on its ability to form stable chelate complexes with polyvalent ions, in particular the water hardness formers Ca2+ and Mg2+, as well as transition and heavy metal ions, such as Fe3+, Mn2+, Cu2+, etc.  References  Category:Amino acids Category:Tricarboxylic acids ","title":"N-(2-Carboxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid"},{"id":"60029578","text":"Nikolaos Biris (born 1911, date of death unknown) was a Greek wrestler.

Glendower is referred to in Henry IV, Part Two, but he does not have a speaking role in that play.  Origins  Owen Glendower is based on Owain Glynd≈µr, a Welsh leader involved in opposition to Henry IV in what is now called the Glynd≈µr Rising. The spelling Owen Glendower is the anglicisation used in Holinshed's Chronicles, which served as one of Shakespeare's main sources for his history play. Shakespeare makes some decisions that build upon the historical record. In Shakespeare's text, Bolingbroke refers to him as \\"great magician, damned Glendower\\" (1.3). Further, Glendower reports \\"Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head/Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye/And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him/Bootless home and weather-beaten back\\" (3.1). This is likely a reference to the belief that Glendower's magic enable him to control the weather. For example, Holinshed's Chronicles recounts that during the reign of Henry IV, \\"About mid of August, the king, to chastise the presumptuous attempts of the Welshmen, went with a great power of men into Wales, to pursue the captain of the Welsh, rebel Owen Glendower, but in effect he lost his labor; for Owen conveyed himself out of the way, into his known lurking places, and (as was thought) through art magic, he caused such foul weather of winds, tempest, rain, snow, and hail to be raised, for the annoyance of the king's army, that the like had not been heard of; in such sort, that the king was constrained to return home, having caused his people yet to spoil and burn first a great part of the country.\\" Shakespeare's Glendower tells Hotspur, \\"I can speak English, lord, as well as you,/For I was trained up in the English court.\\" According to David Bevington, \\"Holinshed reports that Glendower became an 'utter barrister, or an apprentice of the law', and adds that others 'have written that he served this King Henry the Fourth, before he came to attain the crown, in room of an esquire'\\". Other elements of Shakespeare's presentation are changes from the historical record. According to Holinshed's Chronicles, there were Welsh fighters present at Shrewsbury coming to the aid of the Percy rebellion. In contrast, the Welsh do not appear after 3.1, and they are suggested to have failed to appear for the rebellion. Although the rebels draw up the Tripartite Indentures in 3.1, historically this happened after Shrewsbury and thus after the events of the play.  Role in the play  Glendower is the leader of the Welsh part of the rebellion against Henry IV. Edmund Mortimer, who has a claim to the throne as Richard II's heir, has married Glendower's daughter, Catrin, who is referred to as Lady Mortimer. Glendower only appears in Act 3, scene 1. In 3.1, the rebels draw up Tripartite Indentures explaining how they will divide the country when they overthrow Henry IV. Glendower and his forces, in Shakespeare's presentation of events, do not arrive, causing Hotspur to have to lead the rebels against Henry IV with diminished forces. This contributes to Hotspur's defeat.  Critical analysis  J.L. Simmons finds the reason given for Glendower's failure to appear, that he was \\"overrul'd by prophecies\\" (4.4.18) \\"comically appropriate for the 'wild and irregular' wizard (1. 3).\\" Terence Hawkes appears to characterize Glendower and his daughter as a high point in the depiction of Welsh characters in Shakespeare's literature. Glendower and his daughter both speak Welsh, and Glendower is shown to be bilingual, translating for his daughter during her appearance, as opposed \\"to the garrulous but monolingual Fluellen, and the caricatured Sir Hugh Evens in The Merry Wives of Windsor.\\" Hawke notes that there may be an unfortunate undertone to Glendower's boasting that he can speak English as well as the Northern Hotspur, depending on whether a production shows the thick-speaking Hotspur to be well-spoken. As speaking thick referred to speaking quickly, Shakespeare probably did not mean this as a pejorative comment on Glendower's capacities. Megan S. Lloyd regards Glendower, particularly in his relationship to the English Hotspur, as representing the relationship between England and Wales: \\"The Glendower Mortimer describes is one worthy, well read, mystical, valiant, generous, cordial, affable, and more than tolerant of the likes of Hotspur. However, Mortimer's words also convey Glendower's potential for eruption. The tenuous relationship between Hotspur and Glendower recalls that of Wales and England. Assimilated into England and reaping the economic benefit of such an arrangement, the Welsh tolerate much, even the criticism of their culture, customs, and language; yet, if pushed too far, they pose a debilitating, dangerous force.\\" In contrast, she notes that Mortimer and Glendower's daughter seem to have a positive and loving relationship, which would suggest that Welsh/English relationships do not have to be acrimonious.  Performance history  For an extended period of history, Glendower and his daughter were not shown on stage. Thomas Betterton‚Äôs 1680s edition cut of 3.1. John Bell‚Äôs 1774 edition excised 3.1 as a ‚Äústrange unmeaning, wild scene‚Äù (43). In 1808, John Philip Kemble cut 3.1 entirely. Not until a 1864 revival at the Drury Lane theatre did the audience, for the first time since before Betterton, hear Lady Mortimer‚Äôs Welsh song and all of 3.1. That amounts to a 180-year absence from English stages. He is occasionally still removed from stage productions. Graham Abbey‚Äôs 2016 Breath of Kings: Rebellion adaptation, which combined Richard II and 1 Henry IV, completely removed 3.1, where the characters discuss how to rise to rebellion.

He is the founder and president of ELVIS-PLUS and the founder and managing partner of Almaz Capital, and involved in many technology companies in Europe and the USA. In the Soviet years, he was a defense scientist in the Soviet space industry.  Biography   Early years  Alexander Galitsky was born on February 9, 1955 in the village of Zarechany, Zhytomyr Region, Ukrainian SSR. He graduated from school with honors and entered the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology (MIET). Galitsky became interested in theoretical physics and computer calculations. He did his practical work at the Zelenograd Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices (NIIMP) and continued to work there, obtaining a diploma in 1979. Subsequently, at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology at the Research Institute of Micro-Instruments, he defended his PhD dissertation in technical sciences in the specialty of Technical Cybernetics.  NPO \\"ELAS\\" and STC \\"ELVIS\\"  Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices was the head enterprise of the ELAS research and production association (NPO) and the leading Soviet scientific center for space technology. The Institute developed satellites for remote sensing of the surface of the Earth, computer systems for the Mir orbital station, and space communications systems. In the years of Perestroika, the scientific institutes were reorganized, and the scientific and technical center \\"ELVIS\\" (electronic computer information systems) with about 400 employees was under the leadership of Galitsky. In 1990 the founder of Sun Microsystems Bill Joy and the director of the science office John Gage came to the USSR at the invitation of the USSR International Computer Club , ;pplomg for talented technical specialists . Galitsky showed Sun executives a flexible 22-layer polyamide PCB, which he had developed in ELAS and which was significantly superior to the 8-layer boards being produced in large quantities. The IP- based data transmission system for spy satellites also made a strong impression. In 1991, Galitsky first visited Silicon Valley and returned from a trip with the idea of promoting Soviet technological developments in the West through the creation of Soviet companies in the US and attracting venture capital from local investors.  Entrepreneurship   ELVIS+  Sun Microsystems agreed with the US State Department to provide Galitsky, his colleagues and other leading specialists from Zelenograd and their family members with 200 green cards for moving to the States. Sun sent Galitsky 20 high-performance workstations with SPARC processors. ELVIS was not allowed to register such equipment by law, and in order to get round this legal conflict, Galitsky and his colleagues established ELVIS+ in November 1991. The collaboration of ELVIS+ with Sun began with a project of a low-orbit satellite communications system, which was curtailed due to a lack of funding and restrictions on the export of technologies. The companies continued to work for the implementation of the 802.11 protocol in a PCMCIA-compatible device for integrating mobile computers into a wireless network [9]. In 1993 ELVIS+ was already ahead of other contractors attracted by Sun, including Motorola, and presented its development in 1993. Sun then bought 10% of the company for $1 million. In the wake of rumors about Galitsky‚Äôs involvement in the creation of nuclear weapons delivery systems for the countries of the Middle East, closed hearings were held with the participation of representatives of US intelligence agencies and senators. The world's first Wi-Fi module for laptops, developed by ELVIS+ The wireless transmitter developed by ELVIS+ turned out to be of little demand in the market of the early 1990s. Ultimately, ELVIS+ sold its wireless technology to the US government. Together with the 1993 investment agreement, ELVIS+ and Sun signed a multi-year cooperation agreement, under which the Galitsky company engaged in a variety of contract development for American partners. In 1996 ELVIS+ used a cracked Microsoft network driver to developed a VPN for computers running Windows operating systems. The product received certification of the state technical commission under the President of the Russian Federation, and Sun in 1997 purchased from ELVIS+ an OEM license for worldwide distribution for Windows 3.11 and Windows 95 platforms The US authorities did not believe that the Russian company could develop such a complex technology on its own, and initiated an investigation, which was conducted by the National Security Agency. The Wall Street Journal included the company among 10 businesses from Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, which succeeded in the global markets and competed with their largest players.  Elvis Telecom  In 1992 ELVIS+ launched the first fax gateway (FoIP) in Russia and began to provide Internet fax services. In 1993 it became one of the first Internet providers in Russia, In 1996 it organized the formation of the Internet provider Elvis Telecom. By 2000 the company was serving about 10,000 customers in Moscow and made up 15% of Internet telephony market in Moscow.  TrustWorks  TrustWorks was established by Galitsky in March 1998 in the Netherlands. TrustWorks has been developing and selling information security and VPN management solutions based on the IPsec family of protocols developed at ELVIS+. In January 2000 at the World Economic Forum in Davos TrustWorks and Galitsky were awarded the Technology Innovation for New Millennium Award in the first Pioneers of Technology session on innovative technologies of the 21st century.

He was a member of the powerful K≈ëszegi family, of which he became head in 1324. He launched plundering raids against both the Kingdom of Hungary and the Duchy of Austria. After his defeat and downfall in Hungary in 1327, he settled down in Styria and pledged allegiance to the House of Habsburg. Gradually integrating into the Austrian nobility, he became forefather of the Bernstein (or Pernstein) family. Origins John the Wolf was born into the illustrious K≈ëszegi family as the son of the powerful oligarch Ivan K≈ëszegi. He was born in the 1300s, not long before the death of his elderly father (April 1308), as he first appeared in contemporary records only in 1325, and Ivan's province in Western Transdanubia was inherited by John's nephews Nicholas III, then Andrew, who were definitely older than their uncle. In September 1326, the cathedral chapter of Gy≈ër referred to him as a \\"young noble\\". John had an elder brother, Gregory (father of Nicholas III and Andrew), who died years before his birth.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus H√©der 4. K≈ëszegi [and Rohonci] branch) He also had a sister, who married a certain Dominic. In addition, John had a stepbrother from his father's extramarital affair, Nicholas (born 1282), who entered ecclesiastical career and elevated into the dignity of Bishop of Gy≈ër. His revolt in Hungary Both Nicholas III and Andrew died without heirs in 1314 and 1324, respectively. He inherited Andrew's lands, becoming head of the K≈ëszegi family's Ivan branch, who once governed their dominion independently of the monarch, consisting of Gy≈ër, Moson, Sopron, Vas and Zala counties and other lands, but the family was able to retain only Vas County after Andrew's failed rebellion in 1317. It is presumable that John became hereditary isp√°n of Vas County too after Andrew's death in 1324. John was first mentioned by a contemporary record in June 1325, when Herbord Reszneki complained that his familiaris Demetrius Balai, the castellan of Nempti invaded and pillaged his lands in Resznek days ago upon John's order. Herbord was wounded, while his brother was killed during the attack. Charles I of Hungary ordered the chapter of Vasv√°r in July to investigate the act of domination, but John's instigator role has not been proved. In August 1325, John issued a charter in S√°rv√°r that he had donated the estates of Hidegs√©g and Fert≈ëhomok to the Blessed Virgin church of Fels≈ëkethely (present-day Neumarkt im Tauchental, a borough of Stadtschlaining in Austria), in accordance with his nephew's will. Bernstein Castle, owned by Graf Iban until 1339 Due to certain intrigues, it was revealed that John's stepbrother, Bishop Nicholas K≈ëszegi was born when his father Ivan K≈ëszegi was still married. Consequently, the bishop requested Pope John XXII to exempt him from this requirement in the first half of 1325. The pope granted this exemption on 30 July. In the next year, there were reports of looting and seizures of his diocese's certain lands and estates, as well as the neighboring Diocese of Passau. Upon K≈ëszegi's request, Pope John placed the Diocese of Gy≈ër under the protection of the Holy See in January 1327. The pope also appointed Henry, Bishop of Veszpr√©m as Nicholas K≈ëszegi's defender (\\"conservator\\") in June in order to restore benefice of the diocese. According to historian √Åd√°m Vajk, John K≈ëszegi was behind the attacks against the Diocese of Gy≈ër. Accordingly, he transuded private information to the Holy See about the bishop's parentage, in order to turn him out of office, and occupied Szombathely and other bishopric estates in Vas County. Plausibly, he turned against Nicholas in connection with the open rebellion of the K≈ëszegis in 1327, to which the bishop refused to join. John K≈ëszegi entered alliance with the Baboniƒái and rose up in open rebellion against Charles I in 1327. However royal generals Mikcs √Åkos and Alexander K√∂cski defeated them within months. During the military campaign, K√∂cski seized S√°rv√°r, N√©met√∫jv√°r (present-day G√ºssing, Austria) and two other forts in K≈ëszeg with surrounding villages and lands from John. K√∂cski was made isp√°n of Vas County and castellan of S√°rv√°r, ending John's hereditary positions. The K≈ëszegis' dominion had disintegrated in Transdanubia, John lost all of his power and influence in the region. Charles provided K√∂cski broad power in the redistribution of lands to the loyal local nobility and he had the mandatory of royal grace to the K≈ëszegis' former familiares, of whom many left John's allegiance. After his downfall, John was able to retain only Borosty√°nk≈ë (Bernstein) and, possibly, Nempti. Bernstein became his residence and the centre of his lands thereafter. He issued his charter there in March 1333, where he was styled as \\"Johannes dictus Farcas\\" (i.e. \\"John the Wolf\\") for the first time. In the document, he returned the estate of P√≥zva (today a borough in Zalaegerszeg) to the sons of Kalmer Geregye, which was demolished by Ivan K≈ëszegi decades earlier. The Baboniƒái and the K≈ëszegis, including John, made an alliance with the Dukes of Austria against Charles I in January 1336. When Charles signed a truce with his enemies on 13 December after a brief war, he called the members of the two families as the \\"traitors of the Holy Crown\\". The document put John's name in the second place among the traitors, following his cousin Peter the \\"Duke\\", but before the Baboniƒái. Loyal to the Habsburgs The war between Hungary and Austria continued until 1339. Charles obliged the K≈ëszegis to renounce their last fortresses along the western borders of the kingdom in 1339 or 1340. John's cousins returned to the loyalty of Charles, but he chose a different path; John and his \\"some servants\\" pledged allegiance to Albert II, Duke of Austria in Hainburg in June 1339. The duke forgave them \\"for everything they did against his person and country\\" prior to this. The document referred to John as the \\"former\\" owner of Bernstein; Charles I confiscated the castle, which became a royal property thereafter. Following that contemporary Austrian documents and letters referred to him Iban (also Yban, Iwan or Vban etc.), or sometimes Johannes (Johann or Hans). He adopted the title Graf von Bernstein (also Pernstein or Pernstain) despite that he actually did not possess the fortress, which laid in the Kingdom of Hungary. His ancestry and the title of count proved him social respect in Austria, where ministerialis noble families dominated the governance, and the number of families of ancient descent had diminished by the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. The portrait of Albert II, Duke of Austria, who granted the title of Austrian nobility to Graf Iban in 1339 Shortly after his settlement to Austria, Iban bought pledge from the revenues of the tribunal at Neunkirchen. He resided in that town, which is approximately 40 kilometers from Bernstein Castle. In the following years, he received incomes from the surrounding Kirchberg Abbey. He bought lands in Styria and Lower Austria, mostly in the region between Neunkirchen and Wiener Neustadt, along the Hungarian border. Iban married Agnes (died before 1363), the daughter of captain Eberhard V von Wallsee, which resulted his rapid integration into the Austrian nobility. He appeared as arbitrator, witnesses and countersigning noble in several legal documents, contracts and lawsuits, of which the Wallsee family were involved in the upcoming decades. Iban had at least five children. Heinrich (Henry) was born from his first marriage with an unidentified noblewoman. He was still alive in 1377. The other sons were the children of Agnes von Wallsee. Johann (John) entered ecclesiastical career, he was mentioned as vicar of the Riegersburg parish. Ulrich married Johanna von Sonnenberg. He predeceased his father sometimes between September 1381 and January 1382. During his death, he had a minor daughter, Anna. A June 1382 charter also referred to Iban's fourth son Peter as a deceased person. Iban also had a daughter Anna, who married Otto von Ehrenfels and she was still living in 1397. Before 1363, Iban married Elsbeth von Puchheim, the widow of Otto von Maissau (d. 1359). Iban Graf von Bernstein financially supported the dukes of Habsburg for decades. The first documented loans occurred in 1340 and 1343 to Albert II, in exchange for the revenues of the tribunal at Neunkirchen. Interestingly, Iban retired from courtly service for the remaining part of the reign of Albert, who died in 1358. He was succeeded by his son, Rudolf IV, who invited Iban to the ducal council. Among other lords, Iban acted as a councillor in the lawsuit between Vienna and Wiener Neustadt over wine delivery and sale in November 1358. He appeared as a witness, when Rudolf granted the status of oppidum to Hollenburg in 1359. He also functioned in this capacity, when the duke established the St. George chapel in Enns in late 1361, after his victory over Lodovico della Torre, Patriarch of Aquileia. Iban participated in the war against Bavaria for Tyrol in 1364. Iban and his son Heinrich were also present at the foundation of the University of Vienna on 12 March 1365. Rudolf IV, who died in Italy, where prepared a second war against patriarch Lodovico, was jointly succeeded by Albert III and Leopold III. They inherited empty treasury and a lot of debt from their brother. Iban, who bought a house in Vienna, borrowed large sums to the dukes in the following years. He countersigned that document, which granted Leopold control over Tyrol, Further Austria and Carniola while income would be split between the dukes in July 1373. After the Treaty of Neuberg (1379), which determined the division of the Habsburg hereditary lands, Iban's lands in Styria belonged to Leopold's realm, while his possessions in Lower Austria was under the suzerainty of Albert. In the 1370s, Iban received several pledge lands from the dukes (for instance, Mahrenberg and Aspang castles). He was last mentioned in this capacity in July 1382, when Albert III pledged the fort of Gutenstein to Iban. In order to finance his dukes, Iban also had to apply for loans; at the end of his life he was owed to three Jewish traders in Neunkirchen. Decades after his departure, Iban von Bernstein first visited Hungary in December 1361, when Rudolf IV and his brothers signed a treaty of alliance with Louis I of Hungary, Casimir III of Poland and Meinhard III, Count of Gorizia-Tyrol in Pressburg (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia). Iban certified the contract on behalf of Rudolf, alongside several other Austrian lords. According to a document from June 1368, Iban took out a loan from brothers Smerlein and Eberlein, two Jewish usurers in Sopron. He visited Frakn√≥ Castle (today Forchtenstein, Austria) with Rudolf von Stadeck in December 1374. They personally guaranteed the trustworthiness of Nicholas Nagymartoni (\\"the German\\", Mertensdorfi), who pledged allegiance to Albert III and vowed that he will serve the duke faithfully with all his strength and castle against everyone but the Hungarian monarch Louis I. Nagymartoni promised neutrality in case of potential war between Austria and Hungary. Three years later, Iban also sealed that document in Vienna in which Nagymartoni promised does not offer to take shelter for those who robbing and tearing Austria. As historian Ren√°ta Skorka analyzed, the formerly rebellious Graf Iban, who plundered and looted the borderland of the two realms several times, continuing his father's activity, became guardian and promoter of those Hungarian nobles, who entered the service of the Habsburgs, and helped maintain the lawful order in Styria and Lower Austria by the end of his life. Iban was last mentioned by contemporary records in October 1382.

Over seven issues, various figures in American literary culture answered seven questions posed by the editors. According to scholar A.B. Christa Schwarz, the symposium's articles are an enduring resource, with relevance to \\"attitudes toward the black‚àíwhite literary marketplace on the crucial issue of representation.\\" Background The issue of the portrayal of African Americans in culture became an increasingly pressing one for the NAACP's leader, W. E. B. Du Bois, as what became known as the New Negro Movement (or Harlem Renaissance) began to take off. Black artists found it very difficult to overcome the predominance of racial stereotypes as they sought to portray the more vibrant black culture of the 20th century. Concerned with the direction cultural representation would take, Du Bois foresaw many issues arising. Description The Crisis literary editor, Jesse Redmon Fauset, focused the discussion points and asked critic Carl Van Vechten to draft the final questionnaire. Seven questions were posed on the topics of artistic freedom, character choice, writer's responsibility, publisher's attitudes, misrepresentation (effects and responses), and influence. While broadly using the term 'art', the focus was specifically literature. In addition to Fauset and Van Vechten, participants who responded included Charles W. Chesnutt, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Walter White, Countee Cullen and Langston Hughes. Also responding were Alfred A. Knopf, John C. Farrar, H. L. Mencken, Sherwood Anderson, Vachel Lindsay, Sinclair Lewis, DuBose Heyward, Julia Peterkin, and Joel Spingarn. Outcome The white artists who responded to the questionnaire, led by Van Vechten, generally agreed that black artists should be allowed to choose any subject matter for their art without limitations. These respondents included Mencken, Lindsay, Heyward, and Peterkin. Black artists who responded to the questionnaire were \\"far less unified in their responses\\", some of them allowing for freedom of expression but agreeing with the implications of the seventh question: Is there not a real danger that young colored writers will be tempted to follow the popular trend in portraying Negro characters in the underworld rather than seeking to paint the truth about themselves and their own social class? While the questions were aimed at fostering dialogue, the responses gravitated toward \\"rhetorical posturing\\", according to Kelley, who credits the diversity in responses to a larger debate being held in the Harlem Renaissance about \\"the responsibilities and freedoms of the African American artist and the proper roles of white critics and publishers\\".

For many years it was used as a farmhouse but is now a country house restaurant. It is a Grade II* listed building. The house, originally built in the early 15th century but extended, modified and restored by 1800, is sited within a rectangular moat. It consists of a timber frame with brick infill and a clay tile roof. The crosswings at each end of the central hall are jettied at the first floor level. History The Manor House was owned from 1562 by the Lord of the Manor, Thomas Snagge, followed in 1571 by his son, Thomas Snagge (1536‚Äì1593), who was knight of the shire for Bedfordshire in 1571 and 1586 and also MP for Bedford and Speaker of the House of Commons in 1588. The latter's son, Sir Thomas Snagge (c.1564‚Äì1627) was MP for Bedford in 1586 and Sheriff of the county in 1607. On his death in 1627 his sons, yet another Thomas (also sheriff of the county) and Edward successfully inherited. The latter was succeeded by his only son Edward in 1715 who died in 1739. The Snagge family then sold the property to Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough who left it to her grandson, the Honorable John Spencer. The Spencers held the property until 1811 after which it passed to the Alington family, who in turn sold it to the Duke of Bedford in 1873. Substantially renovation of the building occurred in 1880 when it was converted to be the farmhouse of Moat Farm, during which all the oak panelling was removed to Woburn Abbey. The farm and house were then sold in turn to the Franklin family in 1920 and the Hillson family in 1948. Between 1983 and 1985 the house was converted to the present country house restaurant.

Administratively it is part of the municipality of Achstetten.  Geography  Bronnen is located 1 km south of Achstetten, being separated from it by the federal road Bundesstra√üe 30 and 2 km northeast of Laupheim on the district road 7519 The village borders the municipality of Burgrieden to the southeast. Bronnen is situated on a high plateau with some built-up area along the main road winding down the slope into the valley of the river Rot. In Bronnen there are numerous wells, hence the name of the village which is derived from the Old High German words brunno meaning well.  History  The area of Bronnen has been settled from early times on. A number of Alemannic grave fields have been discovered within its boundaries. Bronnen itself was first mentioned as Brunnon in a document from 8 June 1157 in which a church in the village belonging to Saint Blaise Abbey is referred to. Bronnen seems to have had its own noble family since between 1265 and 1365 the lords of Bronnen appear in documents, the last one a knight Brun von Bronnen. From the end of the 14th century until 1639 Bronnen belonged to the lords of Freyberg zu Achstetten. High justice was executed by the Bailiwick of Swabia whereas low justice was in the hands of the lords of Freyberg from 1603 onwards. Following the death of the last lord, Philipp Eduard von Freyberg zu Achstetten, the village was after some legal disputes inherited by his four sisters whose heirs eventually sold it to Wiblingen Abbey in 1710. Low justice passed on first to Gutenzell Abbey in 1685 and, in 1769, to Wiblingen Abbey. During the course of the German mediatisation and the dissolution of Wiblingen Abbey, the village became part of the Electorate of Bavaria in 1805, and following the establishing of the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 it was incorporated into the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. With the opening of the Laupheim‚ÄìSchwendi railway line in 1904, Bronnen was connected by public transport to Schwendi and Laupheim. On 1 November 1972 Bronnen was joined with the municipality of Achstetten.  Coat of arms  The coat of arms of Bronnen is parted per fess (horizontally) depicting in the upper division a burning golden candle and a golden crosier on azure, the candle being an attribute of St Blaise while the crozier represents the various monasteries under whose jurisdictions Bronnen fell or which had certain rights within the village. The lower division shows a village well on or, the well being canting arms representing the name Bronnen. The tinctures azure and or were taken from the coat of arms of Saint Blaise Abbey to which the church of Bronnen had been affiliated.  Economy  Until the mid-20th century Bronnen was predominantly agrarian-oriented. Today the largest single employer is Erwin Halder KG with approximately 200 employees, manufacturing metal parts and components.  Attractions  Parish church St Blaise and Margaret in Bronnen  Parish church Saint Blaise and Margaret  A church in Bronnen was first mentioned in the 12th century. In 1520 it was dedicated to St Margaret and in 1584 also to St Blaise. The core of the current building is Late Gothic but was converted to Baroque style in the 17th and 18th century. In 1658 a tower was added, followed by new panelling in 1667, and Apostle figures in 1672. The interior was further reshaped in Baroque and Rococo styles between 1711 and 1721 and again between 1731 and 1737 with contributions by painter Martin Weller from Ehingen and sculptor Dominikus Hermenegild Herberger from Dietenheim who created a processional cross and statues of the St Blaise and St Margaret. Between 1869 and 1868 the church's interior was redesigned in Neo-Romanesque style during which most of the Baroque and Rococo interiors were removed. In 1933 the nave was extended and a sacristy was added. In 1997 and 1998 the whole structure was renovated.

University of Nebraska Studies in Language, Literature, and Criticism. 2. Stamping is usually done in response to seeing a specific subject, such as a white horse or mule. Stamping is thought to bring good luck, usually after a certain number of subjects have been stamped, typically one hundred.  Origins  Stamping may have originated as an imitation of the act of placing a postage stamp on a piece of mail. It may also be related to the use of a wax seal, as some recorded versions of the superstition refer to stamping a subject as \\"sealing\\" the good luck. The motion of striking the palm with a closed fist after it has been wet by the thumb is also suggestive of an exaggerated imitation of the action of using a seal.  Subjects of stamping  Most recorded superstitions concerning stamping refer to the stamping of horses or mules, usually white or other specific color or pattern of horse. These superstitions suggest that one must stamp one hundred or a similarly high number of the subject in question to bring themselves luck, prevent bad luck, or make a wish come true. As horses and mules became less common, some children shifted the subject of stamping to automobiles of specific models or with specific characteristics, such as a broken headlight. Stamping automobiles is especially recorded among children in Nebraska. Another superstition suggests that stamping the first robin one sees in the springtime will bring the stamper good luck.  Race-based stamping  A version of the stamping superstition exists in which children would stamp people of specific races, particularly African Americans. This form of stamping may specify that the stamper loses the previous stamps they had acquired if they see an Asian American. Race-based stamping appears to be more common in the Southern United States.

Objectives The syndicate's initial main priority, according to Malika Amaouche, member of the collective Droits et prostitution and coordinator of the assises de la prostitution in 2009, was the repeal of the law on internal security (2003), which prohibited passive soliciting. It also aims to fight against discrimination and marginalisation faced by sex workers by claiming professional status to ensure their social protection and benefits.

Client criminalisation STRASS took a stand against the draft law criminalising clients of prostitutes, and organised a demonstration on 4 December 2013, which about 200 prostitutes attended.

It was probably constructed in the fourth millennium BCE, during Britain's Early Neolithic period. Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, the Badshot Lea Long Barrow is the only known example in Surrey. The nearest examples are the Medway Megaliths, clustered around the River Medway in Kent, and the long barrows of Sussex. Built out of earth, the long barrow consisted of a tumulus flanked by side ditches. A timber post would have been embedded into the eastern end of the mound. By the mid-1930s, chalk quarrying adjacent to the long barrow had destroyed much of its southern side. In 1936, local resident W. F. Rankine discovered ox bones and stone arrow-heads in the vicinity of the site. An excavation was launched under the directorship of Alexander Keiller and Stuart Piggott, who sought to investigate the remains of the long barrow before it was destroyed by further quarrying. Location The Badshot Lea Long Barrow, which has also been referred to as Farnham Long Barrow, was located near to Badshot Farm in the parish of Runfold, Surrey. Standing on the western end of the Hog's Back ridge, it was on a slope of Upper Chalk overlooking the Blackwater Gravels below. It was located at approximately above sea level. Context In 1987, the archaeologists David Field and Jonathan Cotton stated Badshot Lea Long Barrow was \\"the most impressive Neolithic feature yet located within the historic county\\" of Surrey. There are few known Neolithic monuments in Surrey, with most information about the area during the Neolithic period deriving from discoveries of worked flint scatters. Among the other known monuments from this period are a causewayed enclosure at Staines and a cursus monument at Stanwell. Archaeologists believe that the primary importance of Badshot Lea Long Barrow is its location, isolated from other known examples of long barrows. The nearest known long barrows are at Freefolk (22 miles to the west), Hinton Ampner (20 miles to the west/southwest), Old Winchester Hill (22 miles to the west/southwest) and Up Marden (21 miles to the west/southwest). The next nearest group are the Medway Megaliths, a cluster of chambered long barrows in northwest Kent, which are located approximately away. The archaeologist Ronald Jessup suggested that the North Downs Trackway might have served as a link between these different locations. Three earthen long barrows‚ÄîJulliberrie's Grave, Jacket's Field Long Barrow, and Shrub's Wood Long Barrow‚Äîare also found near the River Stour in Kent, approximately from the Badshot Lea Long Barrow. The archaeologist Ian Kinnes classed the Badshot Lea example alongside the Preston Candover Long Barrow in Hampshire as the two known examples located on the North Downs. Material recovered from primary silts in the ditches of the Badshot Lea Long Barrow included charcoal produced from bunt hazel as well as a molluscan assemblage including snails which favoured damp scrub conditions. This evidence suggests the environment around the long barrow shortly after its construction during the Early Neolithic. Design and construction Badshot Lea Long Barrow was an earthen long barrow. At the time of the site's excavation during the 1930s, the tumulus was described as having been completely destroyed. Excavators believed that extensive agricultural activity had largely levelled it, although most of it had also been quarried away from the south. The excavators believed that this tumuli was approximately in length, and that it was probably higher at the eastern end than the western end. No evidence of human bone was found at the site. The northern and southern sides of the tumulus were flanked with flat- bottomed, parallel ditches. It was from these that the chalk used to build up the mound may have been dug. Excavators found that the northern ditch measured in length and that its depth varied; at the western end it measured below the 1930s turf-level, while at the eastern end it measured beneath that depth. By the 1930s, most of the southern ditch had been destroyed by quarrying, preventing archaeologists from determining its exact dimensions. However, the lack of any evidence for such a ditch on an area on the south-west of the site led the excavators to suggest that the southern ditch was shorter than its northern counterpart. They also estimated that the average width between the northern and southern ditches was approximately . At the eastern end of the monument, the northern and southern ditches did not meet, but left a causeway measuring between them. In the middle of this causeway was a posthole cut into the undisturbed chalk. This would have held a wooden post which was probably contemporary with the rest of the structure. Given how shallow the posthole was, it was probably that the eastern end of the earthen mound had also helped to support the original timber post. The site's excavators believed that this post served no structural purpose and was probably added for a ritual purpose. The excavators also noted that evidence for a very similar post had been found in the end of the Long Barrow 163A at Thickthorn Down in Dorset. Finds In the primary silting found in the surviving part of the southern ditch, excavators recovered three small fragments of unadorned pottery, which they attributed to a period they called \\"Neolithic A.\\" Radiocarbon dating of material recovered from this primary fill produced dates of 2530 BCE and 2650 BCE. Above this primary layer of silting was a deep layer of sandy red-brown loam that filled much of the southern ditch. Found in this were fragments of a black ware vessel and one or two sherds of a pale ware vessel, as well as fragments of a vessel that the excavators believed was Early Bronze Age in date. In the same layer as the \\"Neolithic B\\" pottery from this ditch were also found the cutting edge of a broken polished flint axe and three stone scrapers. The sandy red-brown loam that filled the southern ditch was also found filling much of the northern ditch. This layer contained many ceramic sherds which the archaeologists attributed to the period \\"Neolithic B\\", later identified as Mortlake Ware. Many of the sherds of this type found in the northern ditch all belonged to the same vessel. As the sherds were distributed throughout the loam layer, it was believed that this deposit must have entered the ditch in an exceedingly rapid manner. This broken vessel had a bevelled rim and hollow neck. Decoration was provided by twisted cord impressions as well as a series of criss-cross lines incised into the clay, probably with a flint flake. The hollow of the neck of the vessel also included some small finger-tip impressions, while the interior of the rim included a series of pendant semicircles possibly made using bird-bone impressions. Also in the northern ditch were sherds of a large vessel which had been decorated with the impressions of a twisted cord. Excavation of the northern ditch also recovered two flint arrow-heads. One of these was leaf-shaped and unbroken; the other was broken, with only the point remaining. These arrow-heads were found in association with the bones of ox as well as the bones and antlers of red deer. Radiocarbon dating of some of this bone carried out during the 1980s produced dates of 2650 BCE and 2470 BCE. Archaeological investigation Finds from the excavation of the long barrow have been placed on display in Guildford Museum Prior to 1936, much of the southern ditch and the tumulus of Badshot Lea Long Barrow had been quarried away by a chalk quarrying operation. That year, plans were put forward to extend the quarry northward, obliterating what was left of the Neolithic monument. A resident of Badshot Lea, W. F. Rankine, investigated the area due to be quarried, recovering ox bones and two lead- shaped stone arrow heads. Rankine brought his discoveries to the attention of W. G. Lowther, a member of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Lowther then visited the site and determined that it had archaeological value. He approached the Morven Institute of Archaeological Research to see if they would organise an excavation. The Institute then launched an excavation directed by Alexander Keiller and Stuart Piggott, who were assisted by Lowther, the Institute‚Äôs foreman W. E. V. Young, and a team of labourers paid for by the Surrey Archaeological Society. Permission to conduct the excavation on land that was part of Badshot Farm was provided by its owner, Mr Tice, who ensured that the quarrying was delayed to allow the archaeologists time to complete their investigation. As ditches were the only feature that was clearly visible, the excavators initially believed that they were dealing with a Neolithic causewayed enclosure. As they continued, they realised that the ditches had once flanked a long barrow which was now barely evident. Most of the long barrow had already been destroyed by the quarrying, but a cross- section of the eastern face was exposed. Keiller and Piggott subsequently wrote up an excavation report on the long barrow which was published by Surrey Archaeological Society as part of their 1939 volume, A Survey of the Prehistory of the Farnham District (Surrey). Surrey Archaeological Society loaned a ceramic vessel recovered at the site to Guildford Borough Council, who put it on display in Guildford Museum. During the 1980s, several animal bones recovered during the excavation were subject to radiocarbon dating.

It is located at a distance of circa 220 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 547 is about 120,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on October 1, 1785. It is a member of the Abell 194 galaxy cluster and is included along with NGC 547 in the Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies. NGC 547 is a prominent radio galaxy, with two large radio jets of Fanaroff-Riley class I with wide-angle tails. The galaxy is identified as 3C 40B (3C 40A is less prominent and is associated with the nearby galaxy NGC 541), and the source extends for 10 arcminutes in the south-north direction. A small, smooth, dark feature has been observed running across the nucleus in images by the Hubble Space Telescope. Its projected size is 0.3 kpc and its shape suggests it is the near side of a small dust disk. NGC 547 forms a pair with the equally bright NGC 545, which lies 0.5 arcminutes away. They share a common envelope,Nilson, P. (1973) Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies, Acta Universitatis Upsalienis, Nova Regiae Societatis Upsaliensis, Series V: A Vol. 1 however, despite their close position, no tidal features like tails or bridges have been observed. A stellar bridge has been detected between the galaxy pair and NGC 541, which lies 4.5 arcminutes to the southwest (projected distance circa 100 kpc). Observations of the galaxy by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory revealed a large very luminous X-ray corona around the galaxy. The gas distribution appears symmetric, without evidence of tails, indicating its relatively low velocity, and thus it has been identified as the centre of the cluster, with NGC 541 and NGC 545 moving towards it.

The three main bases used for the operation are: the Colombian city of C√∫cuta, the Brazilian state of Roraima, (specifically Boa Vista and Pacaraima), and the island of Cura√ßao, of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Shortages in Venezuela have occurred since the presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez, with the country experiencing a scarcity rate of 24.7% in January 2008. Shortages became commonplace in the country in 2012. Since Maduro attained the presidency in 2013, he has denied that there was a humanitarian crisis in the country and refused international aid, making conditions in Venezuela worse.  Maduro blamed the shortages on an economic war being waged by foreign adversaries, such as the United States, and claims that the problems in Venezuela are due to the economic sanctions against the state-run oil company PDVSA. On 11 February 2019, Guaid√≥ and Miguel Pizarro made partial delivery of the first shipment of humanitarian aid to the Association of Health Centers (ASSOVEC). A joint operation from all coalition countries by land and sea attempted to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela on 23 February 2019. In a December 2019 survey by Venezuelan pollster Meganalisis, 85.5% of respondents said that they did not receive support from international humanitarian aid, 7.9% said they did receive aid and 6.5% were unsure if they received humanitarian aid.  Shortages in Venezuela  The National Assembly of Venezuela, with an opposition majority, declared a \\"humanitarian health crisis\\" on 24 January 2016, in view of \\"the serious shortage of medicines, medical supplies and deterioration of the humanitarian infrastructure\\", demanding from the government of Nicol√°s Maduro \\"guarantee immediately access to the list of essential medicines that are basic, indispensable and imprescindible and must be accessible at all times\\". In a September 2017 Al Jazeera interview with president of the Constituent Assembly Delcy Rodr√≠guez, she stated, \\"I have denied and continue denying that Venezuela has a humanitarian crisis\\". As a result, international intervention in Venezuela would not be justified. She also described statements by Venezuelans calling for international assistance as \\"treasonous\\". On 18 October 2018, the United States sent the USNS Comfort hospital ship to South America to assist those affected by the Venezuelan migration crisis. The main goal was to relieve health systems in neighboring countries which faced the arrival of thousands of Venezuelan migrants.  * Three months later on 29 January 2019, the United States announced its intention to open a humanitarian corridor in Venezuela. In a February 2019 BBC News interview with correspondent Orla Guerin, President Maduro has stated that \\"Venezuela is not a country of famine. It has very high levels of nutrients and access to food\\". He also claimed that the United States was intending to create a humanitarian crisis in order to justify a military intervention there. Joint studies shared that same month by ENCOVI, a group of researchers from Andr√©s Bello Catholic University, Central University of Venezuela and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var University, showed that in Venezuelan households, multidimensional poverty affected 51%, 80% suffered from food insecurity and 90% did not have an income to purchase any food.  Creation of the coalition  On 2 February 2019, Juan Guaid√≥, the National Assembly-declared acting president, announced the existence of a \\"humanitarian aid coalition\\" that comes from Colombia, Brazil and a Caribbean island. On 5 February 2019 the foreign ministers of the United States, Brazil and Colombia met in the White House, in which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John R. Bolton were also present to discuss the issue of possible humanitarian aid. In their official message they showed that the opposition government of Guaid√≥ was willing to support them in the land entry to Venezuela. Guaid√≥ called the operation a test of the military: \\"In a few weeks they will have to choose if they let much needed aid into the country, or if they side with Nicolas Maduro.\\" Guaid√≥ also warned that the Maduro administration had plans to \\"steal the products for humanitarian purposes that entered the country\\". This included plans to distribute these products through the government's food distribution program CLAP‚Äîa program from which, according to the 2017 Venezuelan Attorney General and Mexican prosecutors, Maduro personally profits.  VoluntariosXVenezuela  In mid-February, Guaid√≥ reported that a web page called www.voluntariosxvenezuela.com had been set up for the registration of any person who wanted to volunteer to enter the humanitarian aid planned for 23 February. Days later, in the act of swearing in of thousands of volunteers present in the parking lot of the headquarters of the newspaper El Nacional, Guaid√≥ indicated that in \\"a few hours\\" some 600,000 Venezuelans had already registered; in addition, several guilds among them belonging to the transport and health sectors, demonstrated at the event to show their support for the movement. Between 12 and 13 February, users of state-run internet provider CANTV that tried to access the website were victims of phishing schemes. This manipulation was denounced as a technique to identify dissidents to the government.  * Following the phishing incident, the official site was completely blocked for CANTV users on 16 February.  February 2019 effort  Location of the humanitarian aid points outside of Venezuela U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Venezuelan American community at the Florida International University Ocean Bank Convocation Center Monday, in Miami, Florida. According to France 24, Guaid√≥ has made bringing humanitarian aid to the \\"hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who could die if aid does not arrive\\" a priority, and a test of the military's allegiance. He also requested aid from the United Nations. Guaid√≥ said Venezuela's neighbors, in a \\"global coalition to send aid to Venezuela\\", will help get humanitarian aid and medicine into the country; products will be shipped to neighboring ports and brought overland via convoys. Guaid√≥ began to lead nationwide demonstrations in early February, demanding the entrance of humanitarian aid into Venezuela, with hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protesting in support. The administration of Nicol√°s Maduro deployed police officers at all land borders beginning on 5 February; in response, the United States threatened to send military personnel to Colombia and Brazil to protect those in charge of delivering the aid. Shortly after the announcement that international humanitarian aid would enter via the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border, PSUV politician and former elite policeman Freddy Bernal appeared at the border with members of the armed forces and the FAES. On 6 February, humanitarian aid from the United States arrived in Colombia, to be delivered and distributed in Venezuela. That same day, Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Ara√∫jo hinted that the base of operations of humanitarian aid in Brazil would be Pacaraima. In parallel, the government of Nicol√°s Maduro blocked the Tienditas International Bridge with cargo containers, already closed since its completion in 2016, which connects C√∫cuta and the Venezuelan municipality of Ure√±a. The next day, as the Colombian government transported cargo to C√∫cuta, a group of Venezuelan refugees met them with support signs with the phrase \\"Ayuda humanitaria ya\\" (\\"Humanitarian aid now\\"). As the first trucks with aid, escorted by Colombian police, approached the blocked bridge on 7 February, human rights activists received them, and Venezuela's communications minister, Jorge Rodriguez said there was a plot between Colombia, the CIA and exiled Venezuelan politician Julio Borges to oust Maduro. While Guaid√≥ attempted to secure international aid, Maduro shipped over 100 tons of aid to Cuba following a tornado that devastated Havana. Under case file SC-2017-003, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile announced the authorization for the entry of an international military coalition to secure the entry and protection of humanitarian aid to Venezuela. Maduro voiced his opinions about why he had denied international aid, stating \\"With humanitarian aid they want to treat us like beggars ... in Venezuela we have the capacity to take care of our children and women. There is no humanitarian crisis here.\\" In a later BBC interview, Maduro said, \\"[t]he Ku Klux Klan that governs the White House today wants to seize Venezuela\\" and that \\"Venezuela is not a country of famine. It has very high levels of nutrients and access to food.\\" As events unfolded, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez claimed that humanitarian aid provided by the United States was \\"carcinogenic\\" and part of a plot to kill Venezuelan citizens. She also claimed that \\"this so-called food from the United States aims to poison our population with chemicals\\" and described it as \\"biological weapons\\". USAID administrator Mark Green described the allegations as \\"absurd\\". Venezuelan deputy and medic Jos√© Manuel Olivares dismissed her claims, clarifying that \\"the aid has quality control and sanitary registry of Colombia, Brazil and the United States.\\" Delcy's remarks were also dismissed by the United States, saying that the Maduro government \\"would go to any length to lie and deny reality\\". Guaid√≥ issued an 11-day ultimatum to the Venezuelan Armed Forces on 12 February, stating that humanitarian aid will enter Venezuela on 23 February and that the armed forces \\"will have to decide if it will be on the side of the Venezuelans and the Constitution or the usurper\\". Leaders of Pemon groups stated on 9 February that they would not abide by Maduro's orders and would allow aid into Venezuela through its border with Brazil. Mayor Emilio Gonzalez of Gran Sabana stated that \\"Neither the National Guard not the government can stop this\\" while another Pemon leader Angel Paez stated \\"If humanitarian aid arrives and is prevented from entering, we will suspend the entry of government trucks too.\\" Former Amazonas governor Liborio Guarulla announced on 14 February that the humanitarian aid started entering in the Amazonas state through the Guain√≠a, Atabapo and Orinoco rivers with help of NGO's, the Colombian government and indigenous organizations. A plane of the Brazilian Air Force carrying humanitarian aid to Venezuelans traveled to Boa Vista on 20 February, capital of the border state of Roraima providing 23 tons of powdered milk and 500 first-aid kits.http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/internacional/noticia/2019-02/brazil-plane-humanitarian-aid-venezuela-roraima-state Brazil pledged to make humanitarian aid available at the town of Pacaraima on its side of the Brazil‚ÄìVenezuela border so Venezuelans can drive it into their country. Humanitarian campsites were installed in at least ten states across Venezuela by 17 February; the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence detained seven people that were installing the awnings, chairs and sound equipment of the humanitarian campsite in Maracay. Maduro's government closed airways and its maritime borders with the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao on 19 February, in a move that Cura√ßao officials say is to prevent aid from entering. British businessman and philanthropist Richard Branson produced a charity concert called Venezuela Aid Live on 22 February to raise funds for humanitarian aid and raise awareness of the crisis in Venezuela. The Maduro government responded by saying it would hold a rival concert called \\"Hands off Venezuela\\" on the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Bridge on 22 February. The Constituent Assembly President, Diosdado Cabello, threatened that any planes that tried to bring aid into the country would be shot down.  Incidents   Brazilian border  Venezuelan alt= Humanitarian aid was stockpiled on the Brazilian border, with the intent to bring it into Venezuela. On 20 February, Dragoon 300 armoured fighting vehicles of the Armored Cavalry Squadron were seen entering the Gran Sabana region. Groups of indigenous Pemon peoples blocked the entry of the military vehicles into the region, and members of armed forces loyal to Maduro fired upon them with live ammunition on 22 February. Fifteen Pemon were injured, four seriously, and two Pemon were killed. The injured were transferred to Brazil due to the shortage of medical supplies in the Venezuelan hospital of Santa Elena de Uair√©n. Following the crackdown, indigenous groups detained thirty-six soldiers and held them in the jungle. Deputy Am√©rico de Grazia, denounced the lack of medicine and ambulances to transport the wounded. Near the Brazil‚ÄìVenezuela border, more than 2,000 indigenous people from Gran Sabana gathered to assist with the entrance of international aid. Venezuelan authorities issued a capture order of the mayor of Gran Sabana and of the Pemon chieftains, accusing them of rebellion. The Venezuelan National Guard repressed demonstrations near Brazil, while colectivos attacked protesters in San Antonio del T√°chira and Ure√±a, leaving at least four dead and about 20 injured. Former governor Andr√©s Vel√°squez declared that fourteen people were killed and that many of them had gunshots wounds in their heads, indicating involvement of snipers. He further explained that \\"many have died due to lack of attention because the Santa Elena hospital does not have blood, saline solution, reactives nor oxygen, or operating rooms to intervene the patients\\", that the people died bleeding and the hospital personnel could not do anything to help them. Two ambulances carrying dead and wounded crossed the Brazil‚ÄìVenezuela border and took them to the Roraima General Hospital, in Boa Vista, where medic records documented that everyone had gunshots wounds. US senator Marco Rubio declared that Cuban agents directed repression in Ure√±a. Romel Guzamana, a representative of the indigenous community in Gran Sabana, stated that at least 25 Pemon were killed in what NTN24 described as a \\"massacre\\" by Venezuelan troops. Colectivos and the Venezuelan National Guard killed at least four and injured twenty-four more during border conflicts in Santa Elena de Uair√©n early on 23 February. A Venezuelan army post near Santa Elena de Uair√©n was attacked with molotov cocktails and stones. Aid trucks destined to travel from Brazil into Venezuela did not enter Venezuela and returned to their departure points. The Brazilian Army reported that Venezuelan authorities fired live ammunition at those attempting to accept aid and that tear gas from Venezuela was fired into the Brazilian border city of Pacaraima. By the end of the conflict, Romel Guzamana, a representative of the indigenous community in Gran Sabana, stated that at least 25 Pemon were killed in what NTN24 described as a \\"massacre\\" by Venezuelan troops.  Colombian border  US Vice President Mike Pence speaks to reporters in front of US aid shipments and Venezuelan migrants in Bogota, Colombia on 25 February 2019 Thousands accompany a caravan of aid trucks towards the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border. Guaid√≥ headed a caravan of 300 people, briefly appearing on the lead truck as it left C√∫cuta for Venezuelan territory. Maduro announces the severing of diplomatic relations with Colombia. Pro-Maduro paramilitaries fired upon demonstrators demanding aid in San Antonio del T√°chira. According to opposition deputy Gaby Arellano, of the five trucks that attempted to enter Venezuela from Colombia, two were lost to fire, two were stolen by Maduro loyalists and one returned to Colombia. Both Colombia and Venezuela closed their joint border, leaving many Venezuelans trapped in Colombia and seeking shelter in makeshift camps. On the Francisco de Paula de Santander Bridge, Venezuelan National Police wept while being confronted by Venezuelans begging for the entrance of international aid. Venezuelan National Police on the bridge then retreated further into Venezuelan territory as the aid caravan approached. As trucks crossed the bridge, Venezuelan authorities fired tear gas upon the protesters who responded with rocks and molotov cocktails and some trucks burst into flames. Aid volunteers formed a human chain and removed humanitarian packages from the burning trucks to prevent their destruction, with a good portion of the supplies being saved and returned to Colombia. Later in the day, protesters responded Venezuelan colectivos and military with molotov cocktails and stones. On 23 February, trucks with humanitarian aid attempted to pass into Venezuela from Brazil and Colombia, opposed by Maduro's administration. At the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border, the caravans were tear-gassed or shot at with rubber bullets by Venezuelan personnel as they crossed bridges. Protesters near the caravans responded by throwing stones and molotov cocktails at Venezuelan authorities in order to gain entrance into Venezuela later in the day. According to deputy Gaby Arellano, of the five trucks that attempted to enter Venezuela from Colombia, two were lost to a fire, two were stolen by Maduro loyalists and one returned to Colombia. The president of the Venezuelan National Assembly's Health Subcommission Jos√© Manuel Olivares was physically assaulted at the Colombian‚ÄìVenezuelan border, reportedly by \\"colectivos\\". Deputy Freddy Superlano was reportedly poisoned in C√∫cuta, and his assistant died from the same incident. The opposition asked for an investigation, without making \\"claims on who the culprits were\\". A sister of a deceased National Guardsman denounced that her brother was killed by another officer when he asked for a discharge in the border.  Puerto Rican shipment  The Venezuelan Almirante Bri√≥n, a Mariscal Sucre-class frigate, deployed to prevent the 23 February entry of aid from Puerto Rico. A ship originating from Puerto Rico attempted to deliver humanitarian aid via the port at Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, but the vessel, carrying civilians, returned after the Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela threatened to \\"open fire\\" on it. Six vessels of the Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela, including the Mariscal Sucre-class frigate Almirante Brion and patrol boats, were deployed to prevent the entry of the aid shipment. The ship, carrying civilians, returned to Puerto Rico after the Venezuelan Navy threatened to \\"open fire\\" on it. Governor of Puerto Rico Ricardo Rossell√≥, who ordered the return of the ship, stated that the act by the Venezuelan Navy was \\"unacceptable and shameful\\" and that Puerto Rico \\"notified our partners in the U.S. government about this serious incident\\". Aftermath of 23 February By the end of the day, a preliminary report by the Organization of American States (OAS) reported more than 285 injured, and former governor Andr√©s Vel√°squez reported as many as 14 deaths in the clashes. Reuters said that no aid destined for Venezuelan was able to enter the country. Maduro danced at a rally with his wife while the attempted entry of humanitarian aid was taking place, which CNN reported was attended by public employees whose jobs depend on Maduro. Border clashes continued with Brazil and Brazilian patrols arrived at the border to prevent the violation of the territorial space by Venezuelan Armed Forces. From 24 to 25 February, there were continued Colombian border clashes between protestors and colectivos; Venezuelan authorities fired upon protesters who threw rocks and molotov cocktails, and Colombian border police in Colombian territory near the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Bridge. Venezuelan National Guardsmen also fired live ammunition against protesters and Colombian policemen. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) asked the Venezuelan Armed Forces to abstain using force and to allow free transit. Guaid√≥ said the world \\"had 'been able to see with their own eyes' how Maduro had violated international law. 'The Geneva protocols clearly state that destroying humanitarian aid is a crime against humanity,' he said.\\" Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez declared that \\"they saw only a little piece of what we are willing to do\\", and Diosdado Cabello stated \\"we showed the tip of the iceberg\\".  Controversies  The cause of the fire that consumed humanitarian aid on 23 February is disputed. Eyewitnesses accounts attribute the source of the fire to tear gas canisters fired by the Venezuelan personnel. Unpublished footage examined by The New York Times published on 10 March suggested that the fire may have been accidentally started by a molotov cocktail thrown by an anti-government protester. Colombian foreign minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo rejected the claims by The New York Times that the Colombian government manipulated the video of the burning of the aid truck, insisting that Nicol√°s Maduro was responsible. A group of around 30 Venezuelans protested outside The New York Times offices in United States, questioning the newspaper's \\"partiality\\" and criticized the moment of the publication which occurred while Venezuela suffered from a nationwide blackout. Journalist Karla Salcedo Flores denounced state-run Telesur for plagiarism and the manipulation of her photos for propaganda purposes after the network claimed protesters poured gasoline on the trucks. Bellingcat reported that since the open source evidence examined for its investigation does not show the moment of ignition, it is not possible to make a definitive determination regarding the cause of the fire. Deputy Miguel Pizarro informed that the National Assembly would denounce the burning of the trucks transporting aid in the International Criminal Court. The Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza claimed that the trucks carrying humanitarian supplies were also allegedly \\"loaded with nails and wire\\", showing what he described as photos of seized cargo. Before his speech, the United States and a number of other nations staged a walkout, boycotting the minister. Salcedo Flores denounced again the misuse of her photos by Arreaza and dismissed the claim that the photos represented any evidence of the alleged crimes committed by the protesters. Red Cross aid effort Franceso Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, announced on 29 March 2019 that the Red Cross was preparing to bring humanitarian aid to the country to help ease both the chronic hunger and the medical crisis. The Guardian reported that Maduro had \\"long denied the existence of a humanitarian crisis, and on 23 February blocked an effort led by Guaid√≥ to bring aid into the country\\", and that the Red Cross had \\"brokered a deal\\" between the Maduro and Guaid√≥ administrations \\"indicating a seldom-seen middle ground between the two men\\". The Red Cross aid shipments were expected to begin within a few weeks, and the first shipment would help about 650,000 people; simultaneously, a leaked UN report estimated that 7 million Venezuelans were likely in need of humanitarian assistance. During what The Wall Street Journal called \\"Latin America's worst humanitarian crisis ever\\", the \\"operation would rival Red Cross relief efforts in war-torn Syria, signaling the depth of Venezuela's crisis.\\" Rocca said the efforts would focus first on hospitals, including state-run facilities, and said the Red Cross was open to the possibility of delivering aid products stored on the Venezuelan borders with Colombia and Brazil, if the products meet standards. Also available online. The first shipments of medical supplies will bypass the government and go to eight clinics run by the Red Cross in Venezuela. Because of the additional problems caused by the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts, the Red Cross hopes to also provide hospitals with power plants. Rocca warned that the Red Cross would not accept any political interference, and said the effort must be \\"independent, neutral, impartial and unhindered\\". The Wall Street Journal said that the acceptance of humanitarian shipments by Maduro was his first acknowledgement that Venezuela is \\"suffering from an economic collapse\\", adding that \\"until a few days ago, the government maintained there was no crisis and it didn't need outside help\\". Guaid√≥ said the acceptance of humanitarian aid was the \\"result of our pressure and insistence\\", Also available online. and called on Venezuelans to \\"stay vigilant to make sure incoming aid is not diverted for 'corrupt' purposes\\". Maduro and Arreaza met with representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on 9 April, and Maduro, for the first time, indicated he prepared to accept international aid‚Äîalthough denying a humanitarian crisis exists. Red Cross was allowed access to prisons in Venezuela for first time since before Ch√°vez died, ranging from prisons holding largely foreigners to prisons holding largely political prisoners to military detention centers. Iris Varela, prisons minister said the delegates were invited so they could share the amazing quality of Venezuelan reform centers with the world. The ICRC announced a day later that there was an agreement to expand aid to 36 hospitals and primary health care centers. Following the joint report from Human Rights Watch and Johns Hopkins in April 2019, increasing announcements from the United Nations about the scale of the humanitarian crisis, and the softening of Maduro's position on receiving aid, the ICRC tripled its budget for aid to Venezuela. The increased Red Cross aid would focus in four areas: the migration crisis, the health care system collapse, water and sanitation, and prisons and detention centers. The first Red Cross delivery of supplies for hospitals arrived on 16 April via an air cargo shipment from Panama and contained generators, water, and surgery kits. Relative to the amount of need, the initial supplies were expected to be little \\"more than a palliative measure\\", but National Assembly Deputy Miguel Pizarro viewed it as an encouraging sign that the Maduro administration would allow more aid to enter. According to the Associated Press, having long denied that there was a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, Maduro positioned the delivery \\"as a necessary measure to confront punishing U.S. economic sanctions\\"; having \\"rallied the international community\\", Guaid√≥ \\"quickly claimed credit for the effort\\". Quoting Tamara Taraciuk‚Äîan expert at Human Rights Watch on Venezuela‚Äîwho called the situation \\"a completely man-made crisis\\", The New York Times said the aid effort in Venezuela presented challenges regarding how to deliver aid in an \\"unprecedented political, economic and humanitarian crisis\\" that was \\"caused largely by the policies of a government intent on staying in power, rather than war or natural disaster\\". The humanitarian crisis is impacted by the presidential crisis and international sanctions, along with concerns that the Red Cross effort alone will be insufficient to meet the need, and whether the aid effort will continue to be politicized. According to The New York Times, \\"armed pro-government paramilitaries\\" fired weapons to disrupt the first Red Cross delivery, and officials associated with Maduro's party told the Red Cross to leave. In December 2019, Francesco Rocca, president of the IFRC, denounced a lack of international assistance to Venezuela, stating that its international appeal for 50 million Swiss francs was less than 10 percent funded, which he attributed to a lack of political will and politicization of the aid process. Rocca warned that some actors wanted to use the desperation of the civilian population as a means to \\"destabilize the country\\", and disputed claims that the government was not allowing aid into the country, stating that the Red Cross was able to \\"deliver everything in a very free\\" way, but that there was a lack of aid to deliver.  Other NGOs  Member of the National Assembly, Lester Toledo announced in May that the NGO Rescate Venezuela and the Ayuda y Libertad coalition had already given medical aid and survival kits to about 10.000 Venezuelans in more than 20 states. Most of the effort is carried out by volunteering.  Irregularities  On 14 June, PanAm Post published an article reporting that representatives of Guaid√≥ had misappropriated payments for the housing of Venezuelan military defectors that arrived at Colombia, allegedly using them for personal purchases. Following the publication of the article, Guaid√≥'s presidential office informed that the individuals accused of corruption were dismissed from their positions and requested the cooperation of the Colombian government, multilateral agencies and other organizations to clarify the events an impartial investigation. The Venezuelan embassy in Colombia issued a statement informing that Guaid√≥ and the appointed ambassador, Humberto Calder√≥n, agreed to carry out an audit. Venezuelan political parties, including Popular Will, Justice First, Democratic Action and A New Era, supported the start of the investigation of the events. Colombian Foreign Minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, condemned the reported act of corruption and urged the authorities to advance the investigations to determine if any wrongdoings occurred. The NGO Transparencia Internacional compiled a first report on the accused representatives. The report concluded that Guaid√≥'s envoys were only involved in the administration of funds contributed by foundations and donors, not humanitarian aid from public funds. The NGO recommended appointing a special comptroller and independent agency to audit Venezuelan finances abroad.  Reactions   Foreign aid  NPR reported that critics say the offer of humanitarian aid by the United States is designed as a way to place pressure on Maduro and to increase dissent among the Venezuelan armed forces, and that the US is using a similar tactic that Russia used in Ukraine, where 250 Russian trucks entered to deliver aid in 2014. Colombia, and Venezuela's neighboring countries, \\"are the most interested in seeing aid brought in\\", according to CNN, to \\"help reduce the wave of Venezuelan refugees pouring across their borders.\\" Carlos Holmes Trujillo, Colombia's foreign minister, said that blocking aid was a crime that \\"would give even more reason ... to ask the International Criminal Court to investigate Maduro\\". The United Nations (UN) stated in 2018 that \\"[v]ast numbers of Venezuelans are starving, deprived of essential medicines, and trying to survive in a situation that is spiraling downwards with no end in sight\\"; it recommended increased humanitarian funding for Venezuelans in 2019, and cautioned not to politicize aid. The UN said that \\"humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives\\", and calls for a de-escalation of tension from both sides. The International Committee of the Red Cross \\"warned the United States about the risks of delivering humanitarian aid to Venezuela without the approval of security forces loyal to President Nicolas Maduro\\". It also said its ability to work in the current environment in Venezuela was limited\\" and that it could \\"not ... implement things that have a political tone‚Äù. For the Red Cross, maintaining a neutral stance in political situations is most important; the organization holds that, for aid to be effective, both sides of the conflict should come to agreement. Having worked with local authorities inside Venezuela for a long time delivering relief, in February 2019 the organization had talks with the Venezuelan Ministry of Health about increasing its budget. Later in the month it doubled its Venezuela budget to ‚Ç¨15.8 million (US$17.9 million).  Nations  The US pledged $20 million, and Canada pledged $53 million Canadian dollars in humanitarian aid, saying most of it would go to Venezuela's neighbors and trusted partners. Germany, Sweden, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the European Commission also pledged aid. At the Conference on Humanitarian Assistance in Support of Venezuela hosted by the OAS in Washington, D.C., John Bolton announced that 25 countries pledged US$100 million for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Venezuela via centers in Cura√ßao, Colombia and Brazil.  In support  * : The Argentine government highlighted the creation of a \\"help unit\\" to face the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, this unit will serve as a bridge between donations from the country to the collection centers located on the border with Venezuela. * : The Canadian government announced that it will provide US$39 million of humanitarian aid in Venezuela during a meeting of the Lima Group in early February 2019. * : Undersecretary of Interior of the Chilean government, Rodrigo Ubilla, reported on the preparation of 17 tons of food and medicine to Venezuela; said shipment would be sent directly to Venezuela once it is allowed to enter the country. * : The German government destined ‚Ç¨5 million for humanitarian aid in Venezuela, to deliver it \\"as soon as the political circumstances permit\\". * : The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Enzo Moavero Milanesi, agreed to send two million euros for humanitarian aid in Venezuela. *: Foreign Minister of Japan Tar≈ç K≈çno condemned the Maduro government for violently repressing the attempted entrance of aid and stated that Japan supports the shipment of international aid to Venezuelans in need. * : The government of South Korea pledged US$3 million in aid to support the refugee and humanitarian crisis; US$1 million is earmarked for Venezuela for food and medicine, with the remaining $US2 million to go to Colombia, Ecuador and Peru for refugee support. * : The government of Spain, through the Office of Humanitarian Action of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID), indicated that it would allocate ‚Ç¨2 million in humanitarian aid for Venezuela by the year 2019. * : The Swedish government destined 53 million Swedish krona (about US$7 million) for the humanitarian aid requested by Guaid√≥. * : The government of Taiwan destined 500 thousand dollars for the humanitarian aid to Venezuela and the chancellor Joseph Wu declared that \\"Venezuela needs democracy and an immediate economic stability\\". * : The government of the United Kingdom indicated that it will initially allocate ¬£6.5 million in emergency assistance packages that will supply children's nutrients, vaccines and clean water for the most vulnerable communities affected by the crisis in Venezuela. * : The United States government, through its Agency for International Development (USAID) sent several shipments of food and medicine to C√∫cuta, hoping it can enter Venezuela as soon as possible. In turn, Puerto Rico sent 2.5 tons of food and medicines to the collection center located in C√∫cuta.  Against  * : President Evo Morales described the humanitarian aid shipments as a ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù and a pretext for military intervention. * : Spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said that humanitarian aid should not be forced into Venezuela, which can cause violence and clashes. Following the clashes over humanitarian aid shipments, China said it hoped that the international community can provide ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù help to Venezuela under the precondition of respecting the country's sovereignty. In late March 2019, a Chinese plane delivered what \\"Venezuelan officials said was a 65-ton cargo of medical supplies\\". * : The Cuban government called humanitarian aid \\"an attack on the sovereignty of the region\\". * : The Russian Foreign Ministry indicated that the humanitarian aid was only a \\"cover\\" for a US military intervention. On 1 March, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr√≠guez that Russia will continue assist the Venezuelan authorities in resolving social and economic problems, including through the provision of \\"legitimate\\" humanitarian aid. It was also considering to send \\"mass supplies\\" of wheat to Venezuela, claiming those shipments will help normalize the humanitarian situation in the country.  Organizations  * The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said that \\"many of Venezuelans are starving, deprived of essential medicines and trying to survive in a situation in free fall without an end in sight\\". St√©phane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres, said it is \\"important that humanitarian aid be depoliticized and that the needs of the people guide in terms of when and how humanitarian aid is used.\\" * The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, indicated that the European Union has already mobilized 60 million euros for Venezuela and will allocate an additional 5 million euros; Mogherini also affirmed that \\"humanitarian aid to Venezuela should not be politicized\\". * The OAS approved a resolution on 27 March 2019 to \\"urge the public institutions of Venezuela, especially the military and police forces, to refrain from blocking the entry of humanitarian aid to Venezuela.\\" Voting in favor were 19 countries; against 5 (Antigua and Barbuda, Nicaragua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Uruguay and Venezuela); and 8 countries abstained (Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, El Salvador, Mexico, St. Kitts and Nevis, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago). Dominica and Grenada were absent. * The Venezuelan Red Cross affirmed that it will participate in the distribution of the aid while remaining outside the presidential crisis. Coversely, the Colombian Red Cross declared that it will not participate in the operation without prior agreement with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Defections Guaid√≥ encouraged military personnel and security officials to withdraw support from Maduro. During the attempt to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela, hundreds of lower level troops fled across the border to seek refuge in Colombia. As of 5 April 2019, since the border clashes on 23 February began, 1,285 Venezuelan military personnel and police have broken ranks.

It also campaigns against what it regards as unfair disciplinary action taken by the Labour Party against its members, particularly in relation to such allegations of antisemitism. The group supports individual members facing disciplinary action and has called for changes to the party's disciplinary procedures and code of conduct. LAW is led by former members of the party, and has campaigned through demonstrations, meetings and appeals to the Labour party leadership and members. It has attracted some criticism from MPs, the media and other organizations. Formation and purpose LAW was launched in late 2017 to challenge what they saw as unjustified suspensions and expulsions of Labour party members, particularly in relation to allegations of antisemitism. They also call for disciplinary rules to be revised and for Labour's Compliance unit to be dissolved. They believe that the Working Definition of Antisemitism of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance has, as one objective, to conflate antisemitism with critiques of Zionism and Israel and that the controversy over allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party is to a large extent a result of rivalry between its different wings. Officers and membership LAW's secretary is Stan Keable, who was expelled from the Labour Party, as were the vice-chair, Tony Greenstein and its chair, Jackie Walker. Peter Firmin has also been linked to the group. Gerry Downing, with others, was excluded from LAW in January 2018 following comments he made about the role of Jews in society and other matters, which were described as antisemitic. In May 2019, they were reported to have approaching 400 members. As of January 2020, their Facebook page had well over 3,000 'Likes' and followers Sponsors Sponsors of the group include Mosh√© Machover, Ken Loach, Noam Chomsky, Alexei Sayle and Ian Hodson, president of the Bakers Union. Michael Mansfield, who was a supporter, said he joined to defend legitimate criticism of Israel. However, he withdrew after being presented with messages posted on social media on behalf of the group. The group later said that the messages had been sent without their knowledge or approval. In April 2019, LAW announced that Ken Livingstone had become its honorary president. Activities In January 2018 LAW mounted a demonstration outside the Labour Party head office in protest against what they felt were politically motivated allegations of antisemitism. They also welcomed the appointment of Christine Shawcroft as chair of the Labour Party's Disputes Sub-Committee. In February 2018 the group backed Jennie Formby in her successful bid to become General Secretary of the Labour Party. In March 2018 they leafletted and mounted a counter demonstration against a demonstration outside Parliament organized by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council against alleged antisemitism in the Labour Party. In April 2018 they mounted a further demonstration, against the expulsion of Marc Wadsworth for his actions at the press conference for the report of the Chakrabarti Inquiry in antisemitism and racism in the Labour Party. They also mounted a crowdfunding campaign, raising ¬£16,000 for his ultimately unsuccessful defence, calling his expulsion outrageous. Also in April, the group sent an open letter, with more than 2,500 signatures, to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, which blamed some allegations on a combination of supporters of Israel and Zionism with Labour right-wingers and a hostile media. In September 2018 they demonstrated against acceptance by the National Executive Committee of the full list of examples associated with the Working Definition of Antisemitism of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The organization organized a fringe meeting at the September 2018 Labour Party conference, where references were made to McCarthyism and Orwell's book ‚Äò‚ÄòNineteen Eighty-Four‚Äô‚Äô in relation to the situation within the party. At another fringe meeting, Greenstein told the audience that the motive behind the campaign against antisemitism was to attack the left and replace Corbyn as leader. The group handed out Palestinian flags to delegates for waving in the conference hall. In September and October 2018, the group called on Labour Party members not to cooperate with exercises by the Labour Party and the Jewish Labour Movement to obtain examples of antisemitic behaviour by members. In January 2019 the group condemned the deselection by the National Executive Committee of Rebecca Gorden-Nesbitt as parliamentary candidate for South Thanet over tweets relating to accusations of antisemitism. In February 2019 Jewish campaigners persuaded a church to decline to host the group's annual conference. In March 2019 the group called on party members to support Chris Williamson MP, suspended for saying that the party had been \\"too apologetic\\" in the face of criticism over the issue, by lobbying the party General Secretary, signing a petition or proposing a motion. The group also held a rally the day before the Labour Party disciplinary hearing of Jackie Walker in support of her and Chris Williamson, at which she was expelled. Speakers included Walker, Ken Livingstone and Graham Bash, a leading member of Jewish Voice for Labour and editor of Labour Briefing. The location of the meeting had to be changed after the Board of Deputies of British Jews persuaded the original venue to cancel the booking. One of their members, John Davies, was alleged to be one of those seeking to deselect Louise Ellman MP, vice chair of Labour Friends of Israel. In May 2019 the group co-organised with the local Momentum branch a training session on antisemitism for Reading Labour Party members, addressed by the secretary of Jewish Voice for Labour. Local party officers said that the meeting had no official status. Critical reactions LAW has been described as controversial by the Daily Telegraph and as far left by The Times, while The Jewish Chronicle dismissed it as a fringe organisation. Andrew Percy MP, in a speech in the House of Commons, called the group's claim that the series of allegations of antisemitism was a witch hunt a \\"new smear\\" and asked MPs to \\"call out\\" the group, while Wes Streeting MP called the group intimidating, when they demonstrated outside the disciplinary hearing for Marc Wadsworth. The Jewish Labour Movement has said that the organisation, along with Jewish Voice for Labour, \\"ridicule and minimise the real lived experiences of victims of antisemitism‚Äù, and Stephane Savary, a representative of Left Wing Zionists for Labour, has urged the party to expel the organization. In February 2019, the Jewish Labour Movement called on the Labour Representation Committee not to work with the organisation or with JVL. Related works Jackie Walker produced, co-wrote and appeared in a one-woman show The Lynching, which premiered in 2017, based partly on the events leading up to the formation of the group. Two documentary films on the subject have also been produced, The Political Lynching of Jackie Walker in 2018 and, in 2019, Witch Hunt. She was also featured in the documentary series, The Lobby, on lobbying by Israel in the UK.

It is part of a series of golfing games named after golfer Jack Nicklaus. It was released in November 1997, shortly after its predecessor, Jack Nicklaus 4 (1997). Jack Nicklaus 5 received positive reviews for its graphics, sound, and a golf course designer feature, but the game sold poorly. It was followed by Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge in 1999. Gameplay Jack Nicklaus 5 has several gameplay modes, including a tournament mode. The player can choose between male and female characters to play as, and can also choose between left- and right- handed options. The player can compete against computer-controlled players, both male and female, including Jack Nicklaus. Three difficulty levels and various camera angles are offered. The player has three options in choosing how to swing the club, including two traditional options requiring two and three clicks respectively. The third option, MouseMeter, involves the player moving the mouse while the club moves simultaneously. The player can change conditions on a course to include fog and five different wind conditions. The game also includes a multiplayer option. Gary McCord provides commentary throughout the game. As with previous games in the series, Jack Nicklaus 5 includes a course designer which allows the player to create a custom golf course. Unlike previous games, the course designer in Jack Nicklaus 5 allows players to import customized graphics and sound effects. The course designer was backwards compatible with Jack Nicklaus 4 courses. The game features 10 courses, each with 18 holes. Five of the courses are from the previous game, while new real-life courses include Hualalai Resort Golf Club (Hawaii), South Shore Golf Club (Lake Las Vegas), and Mount Juliet Golf Course (Ireland). The game's two other courses are original designs created with the course designer. Several courses are available to the player immediately upon starting the game. At the time of release, players could also choose from more than 125 free golf courses available to download from the Internet. The downloadable courses were created by people from around the world, using the game's course designer. Development and release Jack Nicklaus 5 was developed by Eclipse Entertainment and published by Accolade for Windows 95. It used a different game engine from its predecessor. Eclipse's development team included members of the Cinematronics, LLC team that worked on Jack Nicklaus 4. For the sequel, new features were added in response to user feedback. This included new textures in the course designer, and the ability to import PCX files as textures, objects, or backgrounds. Physics relating to golf balls were also improved from the previous game. While the previous game featured two-dimensional full motion video golfers, Jack Nicklaus 5 utilized three-dimensional polygonal character models for more-realistic movements. The golfers were created through motion capture animation, and were made up of more than 2,000 polygons. Five of the real-life courses featured in the game were designed by Jack Nicklaus. The game's course designer was modeled after Nicklaus Productions' computer-aided design system. Jack Nicklaus 5 was released in the United States in November 1997. It was the last Jack Nicklaus game published by Accolade, which, after 10 years, sold the rights to Activision in 1998. The game was advertised as having an online player matching service, NetAccolade, but this feature had yet to be released as of July 1998. Reception Jack Nicklaus 5 received positive reviews, but sold poorly. Reviewers praised the graphics, the sounds, and the course designer, which Computer Gaming World considered to be the game's \\"biggest draw\\". Computer Games Magazine called the game a \\"must buy\\" on account of the course designer, writing, \\"This program could easily be sold separately at a price equal to the basic game, and it would be a deal at that.\\" The magazine also called the game's golf physics \\"arguably the best of any golf game,\\" writing, \\"Every bounce, every ricochet, every roll looks and feels right.\\" Some reviewers criticized McCord's commentary as being repetitive and irritating after a while, and others noted that gameplay can become sluggish due to the amount of graphics depicted onscreen. Some reviewers also criticized the lack of the advertised player matching service, which was not ready at the time of the reviews' publication. Michael L. House of AllGame called it \\"a quantum leap ahead\\" of its predecessor and wrote that its charm over other major golfing simulations \\"is the unlikelihood of consistently shooting unrealistic scores in the mid-to-upper 50's.\\" House stated that the gameplay was not perfect, but that \\"it's difficult sometimes to find fault because of the sheer beauty of the graphics.\\" One feature that House wrote to be \\"inexplicably left out by the designers is the inability to change course conditions to either wet or dry,\\" although he noted the fog and wind options. House criticized the game's large instruction manual and in-game instructions for inadequately explaining the game, writing, \\"Many features are discovered through trial and error only and the manual contains references to some features that were not included in the final product.\\" Colin Gale of The Electric Playground called it a \\"solid, solid golf game\\" with \\"incredible\\" replay value due to its course designer and downloadable courses. However, Gale stated that more golfers would have been a nice feature, and also thought the announcer's commentary could have been better. The Atlanta Constitution wrote, \\"It's not real golf but if you're willing to suspend disbelief a little, it begins to feel like the real thing.\\" Mark Cooke of Game Revolution considered the game to be as hard as real golf, which he believed \\"a lot of people aren't looking for\\" in a golfing video game. Cooke felt the game was too realistic and wrote, \\"You really have to practice, know which clubs to use, know how much to compensate your drives for the wind, and know how to putt.\\" Regarding its graphics and advanced shot setup, PC PowerPlay considered the game to be \\"just short\\" of Links LS 1998, but called Jack Nicklaus 5 a \\"viable golfing alternative\\" due to its \\"equally strong playability\\" and large number of courses. The Hartford Courant praised the game, but believed that the Links series had superior gameplay and graphics. In 1998, a group of 11 reviewers and editors, from the Hartford Courant and from computer gaming websites, ranked the top 10 sports games of 1997, placing Jack Nicklaus 5 in seventh place.

The route provided service between the Greenbelt and Hyattsville during the weekday peak-hours. However the route was discontinued due to low ridership on March 27, 2016. History The line was originally called the \\"Sargent Road Line\\" as route F5. Route F5 began service in 1978 when Fort Totten station opened providing service between Fort Totten and The Mall at Prince Georges mostly along Sargent Road, East West Highway, and Toledo Terrance during rush hours only. 1993 Service Changes In 1993, the F5 was renamed the R3 and was extended to Greenbelt station. The new route R3 would operate on the same F5 routing between Fort Totten station and The Mall at Prince Georges, but would also serve the new Prince George's Plaza station and operate along Adelphi Road, Metzerott Road, University Boulevard, Greenbelt Road, Cherrywood Lane to serve Greenbelt station. The R3 would also divert onto 23rd Avenue to serve the Lewisdale neighborhood replacing route R6, divert into the National Archives at College Park along Adelphi Road, and divert into the Beltway Plaza Mall loop in Greenbelt. Weekend service would only operate between Fort Totten and Prince Georges Plaza station. In addition to the changes, route C2 discontinued service to The Mall at Prince Georges with service being replaced by route C4, while route F6 was diverted to New Carrollton station with service being replaced by routes C2 and R3. 2001 Service Changes On January 13, 2001, route R3 was rerouted along Toledo Terrace and Belcrest Road to serve the apartment complexes behind The Mall at Prince Georges. The line would serve the mall bus bays from Belcrest Road. 2003 Service Changes Beginning on May 15, 2003, route R3 was permanently rerouted to no longer serve The Mall at Prince Georges due to the Metrobus terminal inside the mall, along with the former G.C. Murphy site the bus used to operate in front of, were demolished to make room for a new Target Store to be constructed on their spots. The R3 remained straight all the way on Belcrest Road until reaching the Prince George's Plaza station which it would enter and serve after making a right turn from Belcrest Road. These changes also affected the 86, C4, F4, F6, F8, R2, R4, TheBus 13, 14, 18, and Shuttle‚ÄìUM 113. 2007 Service Changes In early 2007 when the Mosaic Apartments were being constructed and a new roadblock was created on the eastern end of Prince George's Plaza station, the R3 had rerouted along with other routes that served Prince George's Plaza station that formerly made a left onto Belcrest Road. The R3, was required to exit Prince George's Plaza by making a turn onto East-West Highway, then turn Belcrest Road when traveling in the direction of Fort Totten station, or remain straight past Belcrest Road until reaching the intersection of Adelphi Road when traveling in the direction of the Greenbelt station. This change was made as the new road block and sign by the site of where the Mosaic Apartments were constructed on the eastern end of Prince George's Plaza, which no longer permitted left turns from Prince George's Plaza onto Belcrest Road. 2010 Proposed Changes In 2010, WMATA proposed to eliminate the R3 completely and replace it with a rerouted F6 which would serve Fort Totten station instead of Silver Spring station. This was due to a reconstructing effort to Metrobus routes in Greenbelt and to cut costs for WMATA. Service inside the Lewisdale neighborhood would be replaced by a rerouted R2 while service inside the National Archives at College Park would be replaced by route C8. Various other routes would have alternative service along the R3 routing. The proposal would be brought up again in 2011 sharing the same proposal idea from the 2010 proposed changes. At the time of the proposal, route R3 operated from 5:30 AM to 9:20 PM on weekdays and 8:05 AM to 7:40 PM on the weekends. The line operates every 30 minutes during weekday peak hours while every 60 minutes all other times.  June 17, 2012 Service Changes  On June 17, 2012, route R3 was shortened to operate between Greenbelt station and Prince George's Plaza station during the weekday peak hours only with service between Prince Georges Plaza and Fort Totten station being replaced by a rerouted F6 from New Carrollton station which would follow route R3's former routing. Route R2 would operate inside the Lewisdale neighborhood to replace parts of the R3 segment while route C8 diverted into the National Archives at College Park to replace route R3. The R3 would also discontinue the Beltway Plaza loop having it been replaced by the G12, G13, G14, G16 and the R12. The main difference between F6's service between the Prince George's Plaza and Fort Totten stations compared to R3's service between those two stations was that F6 would only operated on weekdays only, while R3 provided service between those two stations daily. The R3 would be renamed from the Greenbelt-Fort Totten Line to the Greenbelt-Prince George's Plaza Line while the F6 would be renamed into the New Carrollton-Fort Totten Line as of a result of the changes. Proposed Discontinuation In 2015, WMATA proposed to fully discontinue the R3 once and for all due to low ridership. There would be no alternative Metrobus service along Metzerott Road with the exception of Shuttle‚ÄìUM. All other parts of the R3 would be served by alternative Metrobus or TheBus service. Discontinuation Of Service In March 2016, WMATA announced the discontinuation of R3 service due to low ridership on March 27, 2016. The diversion into the National Archives at College Park was replaced by route C8 while other routes provide alternative service on route R3 former routing. The reason WMATA decided to discontinue R3's service was because of the route's very low productivity and has been an underperformer ever since June 17, 2012. The last day of service of the R3 was March 25, 2016 and the R3 fully discontinued on March 27, 2016 during Metro's round of service changes.

Time in ISIS In December 2014, Muthana married Suhan Rahman, an Australian jihadist who went by the name Abu Jihad Al- Australi. On Twitter, she advocated for terror attacks against civilians in the United States and encouraged more residents to travel to ISIS-controlled territory and support the caliphate. The Guardian reported that Muthana claimed that her Twitter account was hacked by others.However, two days later, in an interview with ABC News on February 19, 2019, when she was asked about a tweet in which she called for the murder of Americans at Veterans and Memorial Day parades, Muthana replied \\"I can't even believe I thought of that.\\" Muthana's husband, Rahman, was killed in Syria in March 2015.

Her second husband was killed fighting in Mosul in 2017, and she fled from Raqqa to Mayadin to Hajin and finally to Shafa in eastern Syria. She married and divorced a third man around this time. Muthana befriended Kimberly Gwen Polman, a dual Canadian-U.S. citizen, when the jihadi enclave had shrunk to just a few square miles. Food was so scarce that they were reduced to boiling grass for nourishment. They agreed to try to escape the enclave, although Polman said that her first attempt to defect had led to her being imprisoned, tortured and raped. Muthana escaped from Shafa and surrendered to American troops on January 10, 2019. Both Muthana and Polman were placed in the Al-Hawl refugee camp in Syria. The pair have expressed their desire to return to the United States. Buzzfeed conducted an interview with Muthana, her father, and a friend in 2015. They reported that after her father gave her a cell phone, she created a Twitter account her parents were not aware of, which eventually gained thousands of followers. The friend they interviewed said she may have been one of the only people who knew her in both real life and through Twitter. Buzzfeed respected her friend's desire to remain anonymous. She said that there was a gulf between Muthana's real world self and the more radical persona she adopted on Twitter, offering as an example that Muthana claimed she had worn modest jilbƒÅbs and abayas since eighth grade, when she had only adopted modest dress recently. In an interview with The New York Times, Muthana described how newly arrived female sympathizers like her were made to surrender their cell phones, and confined to a locked barracks, where they were held available as potential brides for jihadi fighters. Citizenship In January 2016, the Obama Administration revoked Muthana's passport, and stated in a letter that she was not a birthright citizen because her father‚Äôs termination had not been officially documented until February of 1995.‚ÄòRule by tyranny‚Äô: American-born woman who joined ISIS must be allowed to return, lawsuit says, Washington Post, February 22, 2019 President Trump instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to not allow her back into the country. Pompeo released a press statement that read: \\"Ms. Hoda Muthana is not a U.S. citizen and will not be admitted into the United States. She does not have any legal basis, no valid U.S. passport, no right to a passport, nor any visa to travel to the United States. We continue to strongly advise all U.S. citizens not to travel to Syria.\\" Her lawyer, Charles Swift disputes the government's argument regarding birthright citizenship, asserting her father was discharged from his diplomatic position a month before she was born. On February 21, 2019, Muthana's father, Ahmed Ali Muthana, filed an emergency lawsuit, asking the federal government to affirm Muthana's citizenship and allow her to return to the United States. In November 2019, a federal judge ruled that she did not have American citizenship.

Early life Hoahing was born in British Hong Kong on 20 October 1920. Her father, Benjamin Hunter Hoahing, was a businessman while her mother, Singha (Susan) Ho A Shoo, became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons after the family had moved to England in the late 1920s. Her mother taught her to play tennis on the court at their house in Twickenham. When she was 12 years old she played at the West Twickenham LTC and made a trip to the French Riviera for the first time where she played in a number of handicap tournaments. At age 14 she won the under 16 singles title at the Queen's Club Championships. Career Hoahing won the junior singles Championship of Great Britain and of France in 1936. She was the singles runner-up at the 1938 South of France Championships, held at the Nice Club, losing the final in straight sets to Gracyn Wheeler. Hoahing, then 17 years old, had defeated Simonne Mathieu in the quarterfinal, who was at the time the No. 5 ranked player in the world and had won the previous three editions of the tournament. Between 1937 and 1961 she competed in 19 Wimbledon Championships. In 1936 she was refused entry to the tournament because of her young age. Starting around that time she was coached for some years by Dan Maskell. Her best singles result at Wimbledon was reaching the fourth round in 1949 and 1957. In 1949 she defeated fourth-seeded Gussie Moran in the third round and in 1957 first-seeded and eventual champion Althea Gibson proved too strong. In 1952 she was a runner up to Betsy Abbas at the All England Plate, a competition held at the Wimbledon Championships for players who were defeated in the first or second rounds of the singles competition. In July 1946 she won the first edition of the Welsh Championships after World War II, beating Joy Hibbert in the final. Hoahing won the singles title at the British Covered Court Championships, held at the Queen's Club, in 1948 after a three-sets win in the final against compatriot Joan Curry. She added the singles title at the North of England Championships in Scarborough to her palmares in August 1949, her third consecutive title at the event. That year she also won the singles title at the Scottish Championships. In 1950 she defeated Mary Ter√°n de Weiss in the final to become the South of England Championships singles champion. The previous year she had also reached the final but lost to compatriot Jean Walker-Smith. At 4ft 9.5in (1.46 m) Hoahing was the shortest player to compete at Wimbledon. After her active playing career she started a flower shop near Kensington Gardens and was involved in charity work.

The school was founded in 1966 with the purpose of serving the needs of students with intellectual disabilities. The school continues to serve students with disabilities, grades 6-12, offering career & technical training in areas such as food & beverage management. History Originally proposed as the Claremont Trainable School, the school was constructed in 1966 as purpose-built facility for training of students with intellectual disabilities, containing only small, special classrooms as well as home economics and industrial arts facilities, without a cafeteria, gymnasium or auditorium. Claremont's building was opposed by the Department of Education and Bureau of Building Construction, who objected to the high cost of the custom facility, 45% higher per square-foot than the bid for City Springs elementary earlier in the year. Nonetheless, the school's building was considered worth the cost by, with City Councilman John A. Pica stating \\"The need for this kind of facility in Baltimore city is too great to let it be delayed this way,\\" and the Board of Estimates approved the project, which opened later in 1966. In 1969, Claremont was selected as the site of a project using federal funding to pilot a team teaching program to attempt on- the-job training of special education interns who did not have an education degree. The federal funding also permitted supplementary services for Claremont students including taxi and bus service and free lunches to be implemented. In 2001, as part of a city-wide reorganization plan, Claremont was recommended, along with three other special education centers, for closure by Baltimore City Schools, in a move \\"intended to maximize efficiency and improve the quality of education.\\" However, due to heavy community opposition, the school board ultimately voted to keep the school open. In November 2014, as part of the 21st Century Schools project, Baltimore City Schools announced its intention to co-locate Claremont within the neighboring Patterson High School, once the latter's new facilities are built during the (projected) 2019 school year. Under the proposal, Claremont will retain a separate identity and facilities within the larger building with capacity for approximately 120 students. The school will relocate to the new Patterson/Claremont building during the 2022‚Äì2023 school year. Extracurriculars Claremont has hosted or participated in a number of programs outside of the school since its creation. Students from the school are able to participate in supervised summer jobs to gain experience, money and social connections, via a program funded through the school system. Starting in 1969, the city had hosted an annual Special Olympics (beginning one year after the original), and Claremont School students have been both participants and winners. By the 1980s, the school featured its own Girl Scout Troop, No. 888. Beginning in 1988, students from Claremont volunteered at the Memorial Stadium, handing out and collecting All-Star game ballots on the behalf of the Baltimore Orioles, in exchange for free trips to games there. The work also led to donations that funded programs at the school like assemblies and a school paper. When the Orioles made the transition to Camden Yards in 1992, they informed the Claremont students that they would not have them perform this task anymore. This led to letters of protest from the community, and the reversal of the change a month later. Johns Hopkins University hosts an organization, Best Buddies at JHU, which partners JHU students one-to-one with a student at both Claremont School and the related Baltimore Transition Connection to enjoy activities together including attending sports games, bowling, ice skating and meals.

Life and career  R√ºchel was born in Berlin in 1937 as the son of a violinist (the father was head of a musical quartet before the war) and a teacher. He grew up in West Berlin and attended a humanities-oriented gymnasium with subjects such as Latin, Greek, classical music, literature and theatre. At age 16, he was an exchange student for a year in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After graduating he studied German studies and philosophy. In 1968 he applied to Sender Freies Berlin (SFB). Until 1970, R√ºchel worked there on the programme SF Beat. A little later, the young editor was discovered by ZDF. In 1970 they brought him for their first real youth programme '. In 1974, at a television awards ceremony for direkt, Peter R√ºchel met , the then-head of the WDR cultural department. A short time later R√ºchel took over the position of the new head of the WDR youth programme. In Cologne, Peter R√ºchel met with , then still a student of Filmhochschule M√ºnchen, with whom he worked together in the following years and who made him familiar with the world of rock music. Together, Wagner and R√ºchel invented Rockpalast. Already in 1975, the WDR broadcast 13 live sessions. At the beginning of 1976 WDR launched a weekly, half-hour youth programme. Once per month they also presented live music under the title Rockpalast. As part of these programmes R√ºchel and Wagner became aware of later world stars early on. For example, U2, who gave their Rockpalast debut in the Berlin Metropol on 4 November 1981 in front of 350 listeners, Tom Petty (14 June 1977), Meat Loaf and Mink DeVille (both in June 1978), Dire Straits (February 1979), or R.E.M., which appeared in front of 280 paying viewers in 1985 in the Zeche Bochum. Rockpalast quickly became an insider tip. For the presentation of the show R√ºchel soon brought in Alan Bangs and Albrecht Metzger. On 23 July 1977, the legendary first Rockpalast Nacht with Roger McGuinn's Thunderbyrd, Rory Gallagher, and Little Feat rose in the Essen Grugahalle. Since then, two rock nights took place each year, which in addition to the TV distribution were broadcast over radio in Hi-Fi stereo quality. Up to around 1983 the average number of people reached was around to in the Grugahalle and some 25 million remote listeners off site. Despite their cult status, however, the concerts never became a quota wonder. Even spectacular rock nights such as The Who in 1981 or a concert recording of the Rolling Stones in Paris in 1976 brought it to just five percent viewing audience. The disastrous result of the Rockpalast of 19 October 1985, when The Armory Show, Squeeze, and Ruben Blades drew just viewers into the Grugahalle (R√ºchel: My most depressing moment!) sealed the fate of the show \\\\- Rockpalast was discontinued in 1986. It took until 1995 before the Rockpalast came back. The broadcasters were looking for ways to bridge the night hours cheaply, so concerts from the Rockpalast archives were broadcast. After overwhelming viewer reactions, R√ºchel began to carefully set up his own productions again. Although the first Loreley festival was still a flop in 1995, in the following year the festival was already a major success with David Bowie, Pulp and Iggy Pop. Since then, the annual Loreley festival and have been reliable fixtures in the programme. The same held true for the rock nights in the Philipshalle in D√ºsseldorf. R√ºchel made friends with some of the music scene's performers over the years, including Pete Townshend, whom he first met in London in 1981, as well as Little Steven. In 2003 Peter R√ºchel left the active role in the show at the Rock am Ring, but continued to serve the Rockpalast as a consultant and editor of the Rockpalast DVD series. In later years, R√ºchel lived with his family in Leverkusen-. He died following a serious illness at age 81, just 17 days before his 82nd birthday.

The majority of the solid waste are packaging products, estimating to be about 77.9 million tons of generation in 2015 (29.7 percent of total generation). Packaging can come in all shapes and forms ranging from Amazon boxes to soda cans and are used to store, transport, contain, and protect goods to keep customer satisfaction. The type of packaging materials including glass, aluminum, steel, paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, and other miscellaneous packaging. Packaging waste is a dominant contributor in today's world and responsible for half of the waste in the globe. The recycling rate in 2015 for containers and packaging was 53 percent. Furthermore, the process of burning of containers and packaging was 7.2 million tons (21.4 percent of total combustion with energy recovery). Following the landfills that received 29.4 million tons (21.4 percent of total land filling) within the same year. As packaging waste pollutes the Earth, all life on Earth experiences negative impacts that affected their lifestyle. Marine or land-living animals are suffocating due to the pollution of packaging waste. This is a major issue for low income countries who do not have an efficient waste management system to clean up their environments and being the main sources for the global ocean pollution. Also, individuals who lack the motivation to recycle and instead leave their trash everywhere they went. The current location with greatest amount of solid waste that includes most of packaging products is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch located at West Coast of North America to Japan. Most packaging waste that eventually goes into the ocean often comes from places such as lakes, steams, and sewage. Possible solutions to reducing packaging waste are very simple and easy and could start with minimisation of packaging material ranging up to a zero waste strategy (package-free productshttps://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/life/packaging-free-shops-in- germany-this-is-how-the-system-works). The problem is mainly in a lack of motivation to start making a change. However, examples of effective ways to help reduce packaging pollution include banning the use of single-use plastics, more social awareness and education, promotion of eco-friendly alternatives, public pressure, voluntary cleaning up, and adopting reusable or biodegradable bags. Plastic production by industrial sector in 2015.Plastic waste generation in 2010.  Types of packaging wastes   Glass containers  Bottles and jars for drinks and storing foods or juices are examples of glass containers. It's been estimated by the EPA that 9.1 million tons of glass containers were generated in 2015, or 3.5 percent of municipal solid waste (MSW). Frankly, about 70 percent of glass consumption is used for containers and packaging purposes. At least 13.2 percent of the production of glass and containers are burned with energy recovery. The amount of glass containers and packaging going into the land fill is about 53 percent. From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of glass containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled.  Aluminum containers and packaging  Aluminum container and packaging waste usually comes from cans from any kind of beverages, but foil can also be another that contributes it as well. It's been given that about 25 percent of aluminum is used for packaging purposes. Using the Aluminum Association Data, it has been calculated that at least 1.8 million tons of aluminum packaging were generated in 2015 or 0.8 percent MSW produced. Of those that are produced, only about 670,000 tons of aluminum containers and packaging were recycled, about 54.9 percent. And, the ones that ends up in the land fill is 50.6 percent. From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of aluminum containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled  Steel containers and packaging  The production of steel containers and packaging mostly comes in cans and other things like steel barrels. Only about 5 percent of steel use for packaging purposes of the total world of steel consumption which makes it the least amount wasted and the most recycled. It's totaled that 2.2 million tons or 0.9 percent of MSW generated in 2015. While according to the Steel Recycling Institute, an estimate of 1.6 million tons (73 percent) of steel packaging were recycled. Adding on, the steel packaging that were combusted with energy recover was about 5.4 percent and 21.6 percent were land filled. From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of steel containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled  Paper and paperboard containers and packaging  The most of it being generated, and within the MSW in 2015, was corrugated boxes coming with at least 31.3 million tons (11.3 percent total) produced. However, it also the top most recycled at 28.9 million tons (92.3 percent) boxes being recycled in 2015. Later on, they are then combusted which makes 0.5 million tons and landfills received 1.9 million tons. Other than corrugated boxes, cartons, bags, sacks, wrapping papers, and other boxes used for shoes or cosmetics are other examples of paper and paperboard containers and packaging. The total amount of MSW generated for paper and paperboard containers and packaging was 39.9 million tons or 15.1 percent in 2015. Although, the recycled rate is about 78.2 percent and 4.3 percent of small proportions were combusted with energy recovery and 17.6 percent in landfill. From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of paper and paperboard containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled  Wood packaging  Wood packaging is anything that is made out of wood used for packaging purposes (e.g. wood crates, wood chips, boards, and planks). Wood packaging is still highly use in today's world for transporting goods. According to EPA's data that were borrowed from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture's Forest Service Southern Research Station, 9.8 million tons (3.7 percent of total MSW) of wood packaging were made in production in 2015. Also, in 2015, the amount that was recycled 2.7 million tons. Moreover, its estimated that 14.3 percent of the wood containers and packaging waste generated was combusted with energy recovery, while the 58.6 percent went to the land filled. From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of wood containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled  Plastic containers and packaging  Plastic containers and packaging can be found in plastic bottles, supermarket bags, milk and water jugs, and more. EPA used data from the American Chemistry Council to estimate that 14.7 million tons (5.5 percent of MSW generation) of plastic containers and packaging were created in 2015. The overall amount that is recycled is about 2.2 million tons (14.6 percent). In addition, 16.8 percent were combusted with energy recover and 68.6 percent went straight into the land fill. Most of the plastics are made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP) and other resins. That being said, the recycling rate for PET bottles and jars was 29.9 percent (890,000 tons) and the recycling of HDPE water and milk jugs was 30.3 percent (230,000 tons). From 1960 to 2015, this graph represents the total number of tons of plastic containers generated, recycled, composted, combusted with energy recovery and landfilled  Role of packaging waste in pollution   Litter  Litter, a horrific sight in water systems and public places, mostly consists of packaging waste. Besides the disfigurement of the landscape, it also poses a health hazard for various life forms. Packaging materials such as glass and plastic bottles are the main constituents of litter. It has a huge impact on the marine environment as well, when animals are caught in or accidentally consume plastic packaging.  Air pollution  The production of packaging material is the main source of the air pollution that is being spread globally. Some emissions comes from accidental fires or activities that includes incineration of packaging waste that releases vinyl chloride, CFC, and hexane. For a more direct course, emissions can originate in land fill sites which could release CO2 and methane. Most CO2 comes from steel and glass packaging manufacturing.  Water pollution  Packaging waste can come from land based or marine sources. The current location that has the makes up the large of amount of water pollution is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch located at West Coast of North America to Japan. Marine sources such as rivers that caught packaging materials and are eventually be lead to the oceans. In global standards, about 80 percent of packaging waste in ocean comes from land based sources and 20 percent comes from marine sources. The 20 percent of packaging waste that comes from marine sources comes from the rivers of China starting from least to greatest contributors, the Hanjiang, Zhujiang, Dong, Huangpu, Xi, and Yangtze river. All other marine sources comes from rivers of Africa and Southeast Asia. Plastic ocean input from top 20 rivers in 2015.  Impacts on marine species and wildlife species  Most marine species and wildlife species suffer from the following: * Entanglement: At least 344 species are entangled by packaging waste, specifically the ones that are plastics. Most of the victims are marine species like whales, seabirds, turtles, and fish. * Ingestion: 233 marine species are recorded that had consumed plastic packaging waste of either unintentionally, intentionally, or indirectly. Again, the following victims would be whales, fish, mammals, seabirds, and turtles. The effects of eating plastic packaging waste could lead to greatly reduced stomach capacity, leading to poor appetite and false sense of satiation. Whats worse is that the size of the ingested material is ultimately limited by the size of the organism. For example, microplastics consumed by planktons and fishes can consume cigarettes boxes. Plastic can also obstruct or perforate the gut, cause ulcerative lesions, or gastric rupture. This can ultimately lead to death. * Interaction: Animals contacting with packaging waste includes collisions, obstructions, abrasions or use as substrate.  Impacts on human health  Bisphenol A (BPA), styrene and benzene can be found in certain packaging waste. BPA can affect the hearts of women, permanently damage the DNA of mice, and appear to be entering the human body from a variety of unknown sources. Studies from Journal of American Association shows that higher bisphenol A levels were significantly associated with heart diseases, diabetes, and abnormally high levels of certain liver enzymes. Toxins such as these are found within our food chains. When fish or plankton consume microplastics, it can also enter our food chain. Microplastics was also found in common table salt and in both tap and bottled water. Microplastics are dangerous as the toxins can affect the human body's nervous, respiratory, and reproductive system.  Actions to reduce packaging wastes   Waste management system improvements  * Segregation of waste at sources: plastics, organic, metals, paper, etc. * Effective collection of the segregated waste, transport and safe storage * Cost-effective recycling of materials (including plastics) * Less land filling and dumping in the environment  Promotion of eco-friendly alternatives  Governments working with industries could support the development and promotion of sustainable alternatives in order to phase out single-use plastics progressively. If governments were to introduce economic incentives, supporting projects which upscale or recycle single-use items and stimulating the creation of micro- enterprises, they could contribute to the uptake of eco-friendly alternatives to single-use plastics.  Social awareness and education  Social awareness and education is also one of the ways to help contribute to issues similar to helping reducing packaging waste. Using the media gives quick access for the individuals or groups to spread information and awareness in regarding to letting the public know what is going on in the world and ways that others can contribute to assist in fixing problems of packaging wastes. Schools are also good for spreading the education with factual knowledge, possible outcomes for the increase of packaging waste, and provide ways to get individuals to give a helping hand in keeping our planet clean. Public awareness strategies can include a wide range of activities designed to persuade and educate. These strategies may focus not only on the reuse and recycling of resources, but also on encouraging responsible use and minimization of waste generation and litter.

It is an erect, hairy shrub with trifoliate leaves and pink or white, four-petalled flowers. Description Boronia adamsiana is a shrub that grows to a height of with many branches. Its branches, leaves and parts of the flowers are densely covered with grey, woolly hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, the end leaflet elliptic to lance-shaped, long and wide, the side leaflets similar but slightly shorter. The flowers are pink or white and borne singly in leaf axils on a pedicel long. The four sepals are egg-shaped to triangular, long and wide but increase in size as the fruit develops until they are about the same size as the petals. The four petals are long, wide and increase in size as the fruit develops. The eight stamens alternate in length with those near the sepals longer than those near the petals. Flowering from July to October and the fruit are hairy, about long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia adamsiana was first formally described in 1890 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales from the type specimen collected by Mary Annie Adams (1874-1931) a native born Western Australian who collected specimens for Mueller. The specific epithet (adamsiana) honours her.  Distribution and habitat Barbalin boronia grows in scrub and heath, on flats and road reserves in the Avon Wheatbelt and Coolgardie biogeographic regions, approximately between Beacon, Trayning and Mount Marshall. Conservation Boronia adamsiana is classified as vulnerable under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). The main threats to the species are livestock grazing, inappropriate fire regimes, competing land uses and broadscale vegetation clearing.

He co- founded Tepito Arte Ac√°, one of the first organizations of the Los Grupos movement. He also founded organizations such as the Asociaci√≥n de Artistas Pl√°sticos de M√©xico (ARTAC, affiliated with the International Association of Art) to promote Mexican art and artists. Life Zenteno was born on March 26, 1933 in the city of Puebla, Mexico. He attended school growing up and lived there until 1951. In that year, through a connection with a local priest, he gained the opportunity to work and study at the Real Academia de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain from 1951 to 1954. There he worked as an assistant to artist Carlos P. de Lara as part of a team working to restore the mural in the apse of the sanctuary of Nuestra Se√±ora de Aranzaz√∫ in O√±ate (Gipuzkoa). While living and working in Michoac√°n, he met Berta Sonia Calder√≥n Cerda in 1959, marrying her in 1961 at the parish of Cristo Rey. The couple had three children. Career He began to publish cartoons and other drawings while still a middle school student in Puebla in magazines such as Forja of the Instituto Oriente. Later he taught painting at the Instituto de Artes Visuales in the same city. Starting in 1964 he began to work with encyclopedias and other books published in France and Germany as well as Mexico. He also began teaching at the Universidad Iberoamericana. From 1968 to 1969 he was an art researcher with a grant from UNESCO working in Spain, France and the Netherlands. Zenteno worked as an illustrator for various magazines such as Revista Umbral, and wrote about art as a critic in various newspapers and magazines. Starting in 1974, he taught newspaper illustration at the Carlos Septi√©n Garc√≠a Journalism School. He collaborated with the Mexican federal government (ISSSTE-Cultura) in art conferences. He was the coordinator of the first Mexican museum abroad, in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Zenteno had exhibitions of his work both in Mexico and abroad. His best-known work is a mural of Christ the King painted in the apse of the Cristo Rey Parish in Uruapan, Michoac√°n. This work was done from 1955 to 1957 and measures 243 meters square. He did the mural himself with no assistants except for those that worked the plaster. The mural is done with vinyl-based paint to withstand the humid climate of the city. The lower part of the mural features contemporary priests of the time and local residents including students and housewives and even a vendor selling pork rinds. He continued to live in Michoac√°n until 1960, painting and teaching classes at the F√©lix Parra School. Cultural and artist advocacy In the 1950s, he joined the Primer Grupo de Grabadores Poblanos, an organization for graphic artists founded by Erasto Cort√©s Ju√°rez, Ram√≥n Pablo Loreto and Fernando Ram√≠rez Osorio. In September 1973, he joined with Daniel Manrique and others to present an exhibition called ‚ÄúConozco M√©xico, visite Tepito‚Äù at the Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco Gallery in that marginalized neighborhood. One year later, the group decided to convert the effort into Tepito Arte Ac√°, one of the groups that would define the Los Grupos period of Mexican political art in the 1970s and one of few to survive that decade. Its purpose from the beginning has been to change the image the neighborhood has in Mexico as well as provide cultural offering to local residents. Its main activity has been the creation of murals with social themes, not only in Tepito but in other marginalized neighborhoods in Mexico City. Since then it has branched out to other artistic activities such as theatre and programs to keep youth away from drugs and crime through cultural activities. Zenteno also worked to promote legal protections for artists, especially in questions of copyright. There was not a Mexico affiliate of the International Association of Art (IAA), so his contacts at UNESCO recommended that he start one. Asociaci√≥n de Artistas Pl√°sticos de M√©xico has its origins as far back as 1970, but was integrated in its current form in 1985. The organization, through IAA, collaborates with UNESCO to foment international cooperation among artists such as painters, sculptors, printmakers and others as well as safeguard their legal and other rights.

She was the daughter of Louis de Coesme and a member of the House of Bourbon. She married Fran√ßois de Bourbon, titled the Prince of Conti. As such, after her marriage she was the Princess of Conti. Biography Jeanne was born in 1555. Her father Louis de Coesme was the Seigneur of Luc√©. Her mother Anne de Pisseleu was the niece of Anne de Pisseleu, Duchess of √âtampes, the celebrated mistress of Francis I of France. Jeanne was the heiress of Bonn√©table, a commune in the Sarthe department in the region of Pays-de-la-Loire in north-western France. Her first marriage, in January 1576, was with Louis de Montafi√©, Count of Montafi√©, Lord of Piedmont, Prince of Carignano. Together they had one son and two daughters, including Anne de Montafi√© born on July 21, 1577. On October 6, 1577, when Anne was less than three months old, her father was assassinated at Aix-en-Provence while in the service of King Henry III of France as his lieutenant. Her mother required the intervention of the King and Pope Pius V to ensure that she regained the succession to her father's estate of Bonn√©table. On December 17, 1581, Jeanne de Coesme married a second time, to Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti at the Palais du Louvre. In 1585, Nicolas de Montreux dedicated the first edition of the first volume of his novel the Bergeries de Julliette to her. The letters written by Jeanne during the 1580s and 1590s provide historians with an insight into the state of affairs in the province of Maine at that period. Jeanne died in 1601 and had no children with Fran√ßois. Jeanne's daughter, Anne de Montafi√© became the Countess of Soissons after marrying Charles de Bourbon, Count of Soissons on December 27, 1601. In this marriage, Anne brought her inheritance of the countship of Montafi√© in Piedmont as well as her mother's seigneuries of Bonn√©table and Luc√© to the Bourbons. Sadly, her mother had contracted smallpox while travelling to her estate at Luc√© to negotiate Anne's marriage, and died at Saint-Arnoul, near Chartres, the day before Anne's wedding.

There are more than 20 described species in Ischyropsalis. Description Species in this genus range in body length from about four to 8.5 mm. They have moderately long legs. The greatly enlarged chelicerae can be almost twice as long as the body. While they share this feature with the Nipponopsalididae, this is a case of convergent evolution. The elongated pedipalps are rather slender. Some species occur in caves. Distribution Members of this genus are restricted to Europe, with many species found in the mountains (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathian Mountains, and Dinaric Mountains). They reach into the Netherlands, northwestern Germany and Poland in the north and to Calabria in the south. A find from Sardinia is considered doubtful. Name The genus name is a combination of Ancient Greek ischyros \\"strong\\" and psalis \\"shears\\", referring to the greatly enlarged chelicerae.

Crime  Chen, who was an illegal immigrant to the United States and living temporarily with his cousin's family, murdered his cousin's four children, Linda Zhuo (9), Amy Zhuo (7), Kevin Zhuo (5), and William Zhuo (1), and their mother, Qiao Zhen Li (37), in their home in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, in New York City. All five died of cut wounds to the neck made with a butcher knife. The perpetrator was discovered at the scene of the crime, spattered in blood. He said, \\"I know I am done.\\" Chen had previously lived in Chicago, and in Florida, as well as in New York and had been staying with his cousin's family for about a week at the time of the killings.  Perpetrator  Chen was an unemployed transient and an illegal immigrant. He arrived in the United States in 2004. He underwent psychiatric treatment and evaluation for fitness to stand trial. According to the China Daily, Chen arrived in the United States from Fujian age 16 with $70,000 debt to the \\"snakehead\\" gang that smuggled him into the country illegally and worked in Chinese take-out restaurants to pay off his debt. He applied for asylum in the United States in 2007 with fake testimonials that a fraudulent Chinatown immigration agency helped him forge, but lost his final appeal in June 2013.  Motive  The perpetrator is said to have been disappointed with his failure to succeed in America, and jealous of those who had found employment. According to Edward Chiu, head of the Lin Sing Association, arguments and even fights between new immigrants and relatives who have begun to establish themselves are not uncommon, and are a result of the unrealistic expectation many Chinese immigrants have of becoming rich in America, and the resentment they experience when they fail where others succeed. Chen, who did not speak English, had held a series of restaurant jobs as a waiter, but had been fired after a week or two. NYPD Chief Philip Banks III stated that during his confession, made via a translator, that he killed his cousin's family because he had failed to make it in America and was envious of his cousin, who was more successful. Chen stated that, \\"Everyone here is doing better than me.\\" Several Chinese-language newspapers reported that Chen had been the victim of a Green card marriage scam in which a woman promised to marry him in exchange for a sum of money, then made off with the money. Chen's gambling buddy, Erdong Chen (37,) told a reporter that Chen had told him that he had paid his fiance $70,000 and that she had run off with the money. According to the friend, the day before the killings Chen told him that he wanted to kill his absconded fiancee.  Arrest, trial, and conviction  Chen punched a police officer when apprehended and later made a full confession of the crime. Chen, who spoke little English, pled guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and two counts of first-degree manslaughter, speaking through an interpreter. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.  Responses  Some commentators seized on this murder to criticize American immigration policy.  Film  A 2017 indie film, \\"Gold Fortune,\\" by Shiyu ‚ÄúRhyme‚Äù Lu revisits the murder in the context of the struggles of new immigrants to America.

There is a small playground and old large chestnut trees, along with a rolling grassy area. Belgrave Square has hosted events, musical performances, and recreational outings. History The area of the square was originally a wasteland known as Church Fields. The residential square was constructed in 1851. By the 1890s the square had fallen into disrepair. The Governors of the Erasmus Smith School bought Belgrave Square from Mr John Holmes. It was used for 70 years as a sports ground for tennis, cricket, and rugby games by the students of the High School, Harcourt Street. Work was done on a pavilion / caretaker's lodge in 1897 by John Good. The Governors rented the square for grazing sheep for ¬£8 a year to keep grass cropped. The rent amount stayed unchanged until the end of this agreement in 1938. In 1942, during World War II, the High School made Belgrave Square available to use an assembly center if it were necessary to put the government evacuation plan into action. Fortunately, evacuation was not necessary, although a water storage tank was constructed on the square by the Department of Defence. The water tank was dismantled within two years to restore sports area to the students. The Sergeant's Pavilion was planned in 1952 to include dressing rooms, a kitchen, and a caretaker's residence. In 1961, new school was built which moved the students to their sports grounds, so the High School no longer used the square for sports. The Diocesan School for Girls purchased the square. The students used the square for hockey, tennis, and netball. In the early 1970s the Diocesan School for Girls merged with the High School, so did not need the square for sports any longer. The square remained private property and closed to the public, including to residents. Residents called a public meeting on October 8, 1973 in the Rathmines and Rathgar Musical Society, which formed the Belgrave Residents Association. The square was posted for sale in 1975. The Dublin City Council acquired the square to develop into a local park on Sept 16, 1975, from the Dublin, Glendalough, and Kildare Diocesan Board of Education for ¬£7500. Paths were laid out, grass and shrubs planted, but the shrubs became too dense so were removed and converted to a rolling landscape with grass and trees.

Voto di castit√† was also released on DVD in Italy by CG Entertainment in their \\"Cinekult\\" series, featuring the film in its Italian language version as an anamorphic widescreen transfer, with Italian subtitles. The DVD also included an interview with Eastman and the film in its super 8 version. The film had previously been released on VHS by Universal-Video, Magnum 3B, and Shendene (in its series \\"I maestri dell'erotismo - Il cinema di Joe D'Amato\\"). Reception Marco Giusti calls the film and sees its major value in the fact that it brought together D'Amato and Gemser. Gordiano Lupi concurred with that judgement. He observed that the film contaminates comedy with erotic film proper, pointing out the length of Gemser's nude ballet-like dance in her bedroom in front of the boy. Lupi also noted the splatter-horror influence in the dreamlike sequence. However, he concluded that it is not a great film precisely because of its indecision between its comic and serious aspects, such as the main character's oedipodal problem. Good actors were misused, and some scenes seem to have been inserted to draw out the runtime. S√©bastien Gayraud, in contrast, applauded the film as one that is more than a mere sidenote in D'Amato's filmography and deserves to be rediscovered. He observed parallels between the morbid dream-sequences of Voto di castit√† and D'Amato's previous film Emanuelle's Revenge (1975), and viewed the boy Andrea as the first of D'Amato's impotent and frustrated male anti-heroes - a type that would return in Beyond the Darkness (1979) and A Lustful Mind (1986).

It is situated in the Cascade Range, southwest of Mount Adams. Sleeping Beauty is so named because its profile as seen from the east side of the Trout Lake Valley somewhat resembles a sleeping woman. Precipitation runoff from Sleeping Beauty drains into tributaries of the White Salmon River. The peak is composed of andesitic magma that intruded up into older volcanic rocks more than 25 million years ago and is now surrounded by a forest of old-growth Douglas fir and mountain hemlock.https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/giffordpinchot/recarea/?recid=31918 Sleeping Beauty Peak Trail is a 1.4 mile steep trail that ends at the base of the rock outcrop known as Sleeping Beauty. The peak was the site of a former fire lookout tower that was constructed in 1931. Climate Sleeping Beauty is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

The recipe from the book Hawai'i: Tropical Rum Drinks & Cuisine By Don the Beaschcomber calls for it being garnished with fresh mint and a lime wheel, although a length of spiral cut lime peel made to look like a snake is used for aesthetics in some cobra named cocktails. History The Cobra's Fang was one of many drinks with theatrical names placed onto \\"The Beachcomber\\"'s menus, going along with the likes of the Shark's Tooth and Nelson's Blood and meant to evoke a sense of faux-danger as part of the exotic tropical mood he set for his bars. As shown on a 1941 Don the Beachcomber drink menu the Cobra's Fang cost $1 and was served in a tall curved glass. Some feel the use of fassionola syrup was particularly important to the drink, which Beach may have brought along with him from his youth in New Orleans. Some claim fassionola was invented by Beach. Others believe that is unclear. Variations Jeff Berry has a version from circa 1937 that he also attributes to Donn Beach that calls for 1 1/2 oz 151 proof Demerara rum, 1/2 oz passion fruit syrup, 1/2 oz orange and lime juices, 1/2 oz of falernum, 1 dash of bitters and 6 drops of absinthe. The Tiki Ti has their own version as well. The Sidewinder's Fang was The Lanai restaurant's version of a Cobra's Fang cooler and called for 1 oz of Demerara rum, 1 oz dark Jamaican rum, 1 1/2 oz of passion fruit syrup, and 1 1/2 oz each of orange and lime juice along with 3 oz of club soda. Eponymous mug As served in the early days of the Beachcomber restaurants, the Cobra's Fang was presented in a tall curved glass. Because some later drink menus from other restaurants showed the Cobra's Fang in a special snake shaped Tiki mug there is debate over whether such a historical mug truly existed. Regardless, modern manufacturing of a replica for such a mug has taken place.

Delivering sense, knowledge management and limited hazard management capabilities in support of military tasks at home and abroad. Established with a workforce from the Royal Tank Regiment, Royal Engineers, Royal Logistics Corps, Royal Army Medical Corps, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Adjutant Generals Corps, Intelligence Corps and Royal Army Physical Training Corps. 28 Engr Regt (C-CBRN) operational chain of command is 29 Explosive Ordinance & Search Group, 8th Engineer Brigade as part of 1st (UK) Division.  History  28 Engineer Regiment can trace its history back to 1951 when it was formed in Benghazi, Libya and saw service in Korea with the 1st Commonwealth Division in the Korean War. In 1956, 28 Engineer Regiment deployed to Christmas Island in support of the original Operation GRAPPLE. The primary task of the Regiment was the construction of the airfield and the ‚ÄòMain-Camp‚Äô, from which nuclear tests would be facilitated. In January 1957, on completion of their tasks in the Pacific Ocean, a letter was received from the War Office announcing the disbandment of the Regiment and the subordination of its sub-units.[1] In 1971, the regiment was re-formed as 28 Amphibious Engineer Regiment, coming under operational control of Commander, Royal Engineers, I (BR) Corps in West Germany.[1] They were equipped with the M2 Amphibious Bridging Equipment. This new role saw the Regiment participate in countless divisional and corps level exercises across Europe, as the threat from the USSR increased and the Cold War ensued. In 1992, the Regiment was re-organised under the Options for Change reforms. 28 Amphibious Engineer Regiment was re-roled as a general support regiment tasked with supporting the 1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom) with its amphibious commitment remaining but reduced to a single squadron (23 Amphibious Engineer Squadron). Between 1994 and 2014, the Regiment saw deployments to the Former Yugoslavia, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Macedonia, Kosovo, Congo, Iraq, Afghanistan and Cyprus in a variety of roles including peace-keeping, Counter Insurgency and warfighting. 28 Engr Regt was deployed on the initial invasion during Op TELIC; 23 Amph Engr Sqn and the by then in service M3 amphibious rigs were used to enter Basra. Additionally, the Regiment deployed personnel to London in support of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Before the initial Army 2020 changes, the regiment was re-roled as a close support engineer regiment, attached to the 11th Light Brigade. In 2014 the unit was disbanded as a result of the Army 2020 reforms.[2]  History of former British CBRN units  On 22 April 1915, the German Army deployed Chlorine gas cannisters to the front line in Ypres and released the gas against the British Army units in the opposing trenches. Subsequently the British Government authorised the retaliatory use of Chlorine Gas during the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915. By the end of the war, poison gas was in widespread us by both sides and gas warfare became part of the enduring image of war on the Western Front. The development and subsequent deployment of British chemical weapons was the task given to the newly formed Special Brigade Royal Engineers; a formation raised in secret by Sir John French in June 1915 and Commanded by Lt Col C H Foulkes RE. From 1915 to 1918, Foulkes oversaw the Special Brigade‚Äôs experimentation in order to develop both offensive and defensive capabilities including a variety of lethal and incapacitating chemicals such as Phosgene and Mustard gases to deploy against the German troops and respirators and capes to protect troops in the trenches The Brigade also developed a number of means of delivering these chemicals including munitions and cannisters fired from Livens Projectors, trench mortars, artillery guns and other ordnance dropped by the Royal Flying Corps and latterly the Royal Air Force. The Special Brigade was composed of Special Companies of the Royal Engineers, however, the soldiers were recruited from across the Army; seeking ‚ÄòChemists‚Äô and those with any experienced in working with chemicals. The Brigade endured through the inter-war period and into the Second World War, albeit renamed the Royal Engineers Special Warfare Group. At its peak, the Special Brigade numbered 258 Officers and 5,832 men. The Brigade conducted 768 gas operations involving 88,000 gas cylinders, 197,000 projectors and 178,000 mortar bombs; using an estimated 5,700 tonnes of various gases and chemicals. Total casualties in the Brigade during the World War I numbered 5,384; close to 88% of its total strength. 557 decorations were awarded to soldiers serving in the Brigade, including one Victoria Cross.Having relinquished responsibility for the conduct of offensive and defensive chemical warfare operations in 1942 the sub-units in the Special Warfare Groups were re-roled as Field Squadrons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is an arms control treaty that outlaws the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and their precursors which entered into force on 29 April 1997. As a signed and ratified members of the treaty the United Kingdom no longer has an offensive Chemical weapons program. Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear capability exists to offer a defence for the British Military against a range of CBRN threats. This contemporary capability was delivered initially by 1st The Queen‚Äôs Dragoon Guards during 1991 Gulf War under command of the Divisional Engineer Group (DEG), before being passed to the Royal Yeomanry. As part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR) the Joint NBC Regiment was formed, established at RAF Honington, Suffolk, consisting of 1st Royal Tank Regiment (less CHALLENGER 2 equipped A Squadron and CVR(T) SABRE and SCIMITAR equipped Close Reconnaissance Troop, attached to the Land Warfare Centre Battle Group) and saw the reformation of 27 Squadron RAF Regiment under command, it subsequently changed its name to the Joint CBRN Regiment in 2005. The Joint NBC / CBRN Regiment served operationally in-role: Kuwait 1999-2003, Iraq 2003-09 and Afghanistan from 2001-11, led by Commanding Officer 1st Royal Tank Regiment, until the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). SDSR then ordered all dismounted capability to be transferred under command of Wing Commander, 20 Force Protection Wing, RAF Regiment in 2011, reducing the scale to consist of 26 and 27 Sqns RAF Regiment. 1st and 2nd Royal Tank Regiments then amalgamated to form the Royal Tank Regiment in 2014, less FALCON Squadron who were re-established and moved under 22 (Armoured) Engineer Regiment (2014-19) in the C-CRN Area Survey and Reconnaissance mounted role, as divisional troops to 3rd (UK) Division. Starting in 2019 the British Army has now taken back the lead user role from the RAF for delivery of Specialist C-CBRN capability on behalf of UK Defence. Over a century later the Corps of Royal Engineers have once again taken responsibility for delivery of Specialist Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (C-CBRN) capability on behalf of the British Army, supported by the Royal Tank Regiment.  Reformation  The Regiment reformed on 1 April 2019 as a counter-chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (C-CBRN) regiment with dismounted RE elements to be based at Rock Barracks in Woodbridge, Suffolk, whilst mounted RTR elements remain in Harman Lines, Warminster, Wiltshire.[3] [4] The sub-units of 28 Engineer Regiment (C-CBRN) are: * 64 Headquarters & Support Squadron (C-CBRN), Royal Engineers; * FALCON Squadron (C-CBRN), Royal Tank Regiment; * 42 Field Squadron (C-CBRN), Royal Engineers; * 77 Field Squadron (C-CBRN), Royal Engineers  The Regimental emblem  Regimental emblem featuring benzene ring and frigate bird. The emblem on the new 28 Engineer Regiment flag is a Christmas Island Frigatebird emblazoned on a hexagon. The hexagon was used as an emblem by a number of Royal Engineer Special Warfare Groups in WW1 and draws inspiration from the chemical diagram for the Benzene ring; a chemical structure found in a large number of chemical warfare agents. The Hexagon remains part of the symbology and iconography adorning identifying badges and emblems of CBRN units and organisations of many NATO partners. The Christmas Island Frigate bird is endemic to the Christmas Islands and was the motif for the original Operation GRAPPLE on which 28 Engineer Regiment deployed.

McBride began his career in the 1930s in the circles of black art collectives and artistic opportunities afforded by the Works Progress Administration. He would ultimately leave his mark in Chicago as a driving force behind the South Side Community Art Center. McBride distinguished himself as a teacher, as a cultural and political activist, and as a collector of African art and artwork by black artists of his generation. Personal life William McBride, Jr. was born in 1912 in Algiers, New Orleans. He was the second of three children of William and Mary McBride. When he was around ten years old, he joined the so-called Great Migration of African Americans as he and his family moved to the Chicago's South Side, where he attended St. Elizabeth grammar school and Wendell Phillips High School. McBride passed away on August 11, 2000 at the Alden Princeton Rehabilitation Center in Chicago, at the age of 87. Artistic career  Arts and Crafts Guild  Early in his life, McBride was interested in the visual arts. In the early 1930s, he took classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and he went on to join a collective of young black artists known as the Arts and Crafts Guild. The guild was formed by George Neal during the Great Depression, and its members met regularly to share techniques and skills, discuss art and politics, and raise funds for their own exhibitions and artistic pursuits.  Civilian Conservation Corps  While collaborating with the Arts and Crafts Guild, McBride also worked for the New Deal's Civilian Conservation Corps. By 1935, McBride was working as an artist through the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), Illinois Art Project. Among his various WPA projects, McBride designed books and sketched costumes for the Federal Theater Project, including for such productions as the theatrical adaptation of Helen Bannerman's 1899 children's book, Little Black Sambo.  South Side Community Art Center  McBride is also credited as an early supporter and featured artist of the South Side Community Art Center (SSCAC). The SSCAC was established by the Federal Art Project/Works Project Administration as an inner-city community art center located in a former mansion on S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago. The SSCAC was formally dedicated in 1941, but held its first exhibition on December 15, 1940. The exhibition featured paintings that had already been on display at the American Negro Exposition held in Chicago earlier that year. McBride's paintings were featured in the exhibition alongside works by his contemporaries, including Henry Avery, William Carter, Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Joseph Kersey, Margaret Taylor Goss (later Margaret Taylor-Burroughs), and Bernard Goss. Margaret Taylor Goss proclaimed the mission of the SSCAC as the \\"defense of culture.\\" When the country entered World War II, the federal government drastically reduced WPA spending, with all federal funding for art projects terminating in 1943. Despite losing federal assistance, the SSCAC nevertheless remained active through local fundraising and community support. To this day, the SSCAC remains the only surviving community art center created under the WPA.  Promotional designs  During the early 1940s, McBride served as publicity director of the SSCAC. He became renowned for his designs in souvenir books and posters for the SSCAC's Artists and Models Ball, which was the organization's annual fundraising gala. The first Artists and Models Ball was held in 1939. The event was considered a marquee calendar event in the Bronzeville neighborhood. McBride also created Christmas cards for the nearby tavern The Brass Rail. McBride's souvenir books and concert programs included advertisements for, representations of, and endorsements from many sectors of black Chicago society, such as the Metropolitan Mutual Assurance Company, a black Chicago insurance company. The promotional items created by McBride for the SSCAC would go on to become some of his most celebrated works.  Performing Arts  In the 1940s, McBride wrote a number of mostly unpublished plays, poems, and songs, and through the 1950s he was active in the Black Chicago Renaissance dance scene. McBride served as art director for both the annual Sadie Bruce Dance Revue and the annual concert of the Mildred B. Haessler Ballet Group.  Silkscreen prints  McBride learned screen-printing while working for the display section of Goldblatt's, a chain of department stores in Chicago. McBride later famously became inspired by African masks, and incorporated them into his screenprints, as in his series of prints featuring masks in the early 1940s. McBride \\"looked to Africa for a visual language,\\" which he found in traditional African art exhibited in natural history museums and textile designs he reportedly came across in the British publication The Illustrated London News.  Art collector  McBride was known as \\"a collector's collector.\\" He traveled to postcolonial nations such as Ghana, Benin, and Nigeria, and collected African art to bring back to the United States. For this he is credited with helping to raise awareness in Chicago of the art and culture of the black diaspora. McBride was also interested in documenting his own community in South Side Chicago. Commenting on McBride's collecting habits, an observer quoted in a Chicago Tribune article described McBride as having gone \\"to virtually every art show, live performance and play, anything that was happening in the vibrant world of the South Side from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. And he'd go to an event and pull the paper off the wall and take it home.\\" Early on, McBride recognized the talents of his fellow Chicago artists such as Charles White, Eldzier Cortor, William Carter, Charles Sebree, Richard Hunt, Marion Perkins, Margaret Tayler Goss Burroughs, Gordon Parks, Joseph Kersey, and over time built his own collection of their works. In 1995, McBride donated his collection of thousands of posters, playbills, exhibition catalogs and other ephemera to the Chicago Public Library's Vivian G. Harsh Collection of Afro-American History and Literature, a major repository of African American artists' activities in Chicago between the 1920s and the 1950s. His papers include early SSCAC organizational and publicity files, as well as extensive files of cultural and political activities, correspondence, fliers, programs, posters, playbills, art studies and photographs.

Although not charged with a terrorism offense, prosecutors called Hasson a \\"domestic terrorist\\" and accused him of plotting the targeted assassinations of high-profile American politicians, media figures, and others, as well as indiscriminate terror attacks against what Hasson called \\"leftists in general.\\" Career Hasson was an F/A-18 aircraft mechanic in the Marine Corps from 1988 to 1993, achieving the rank of corporal. He was then on active duty with the Army National Guard for approximately two years. He served with the Virginia Army National Guard as an infantryman with Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 183rd Infantry Regiment. In September 1995, Hasson transferred to the Arizona Army National Guard and left in March 1996, exiting with the same rank as when he joined. He served in the Coast Guard for more than twenty years; initially as an Electronics Technician. At the time of his arrest, Hasson was an acquisitions officer for the Coast Guard's National Security Cutter program at Coast Guard Headquarters, having served in that post since June 2016. 2019 plot Beliefs, ideology, and 2019 plot Hasson identifies as a white nationalist. In court filings, prosecutors wrote that Hasson drew inspiration from Norwegian terrorist Anders Behring Breivik and abortion clinic bomber Eric Robert Rudolph. Hasson had been amassing guns and ammunition since 2017. His goals included the assassination of high- profile Democratic and left-leaning politicians and media figures. Hasson attempted to discover where Democratic politicians and media figures lived and made Google searches such as \\"what if trump illegally impeached\\", \\"civil war if trump impeached\\", \\"best place in dc\\", \\"where in dc to congress live\\", \\"social democrats usa\\", \\"most liberal senators\\", \\"where do most senators live in dc\\", \\"where in dc to see congress people\\", \\"do senators have ss protection\\", and \\"are supreme court justices protected\\". Hasson searched and found out the address of MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Hasson had expressed belief in the white genocide conspiracy theory. Hasson created a \\"hit list\\" spreadsheet naming various journalists, Democratic politicians, and socialist figures and organizations and used computers at his workplace to study the manifestos of various mass shooters; prosecutors also alleged he used work computers to plan an attack. In addition to being a self-proclaimed white nationalist, Hasson is a neo-Nazi and he has been a white power skinhead for the last 30 years. He advocated turning the Pacific Northwest into an all- white homeland when he sent a letter to the American neo-Nazi and leader of the Northwest Front Harold Covington stating that he has been on his website briefly and read most of his books. Hasson expressed dissatisfaction with holding public rallies and gaining support from the public in a letter which he wrote several weeks after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia and preferred militant action, including actions targeting individual public figures who he believed were \\"Cultural Marxists\\". Hasson was planning to use biological weapons such as the Spanish flu, botulism, and anthrax to \\"kill almost every last person on the earth\\", followed by attacks on the food supply. He recommended building stockpiles in five locations, the contents of which were to be food, firearms, clothing/military gear, and extra mortar recoilless rifles. He recommended gaining combat/military experience and chemistry skills in addition to buying three homes and hideouts. Hasson wanted to use tactics from the Euromaidan protests and the Donbass conflict in Ukraine in order to raise tensions between the \\"govt/police\\" and \\"BLM protestors and other leftist crap\\". Hasson is an antisemite as expressed in the letter \\"I don't know if there truly is a 'Conspiracy' of (((People))) out to destroy me and mine, but there is an attack nonetheless\\". The same letter referred to \\"muslim scum\\". Hasson also made searches which included \\"white homeland\\", \\"when are whites going to wake up\\" and \\"please god let there be a race war\\" including the addresses of various Supreme Court justices and a gun to kill African-Americans. Investigation and arrest Hasson was arrested on February 15, 2019, in the parking garage of the Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington. Federal investigators executed search warrants at Hasson's apartment and office in Silver Spring, Maryland. Hasson \\"conducted online searches and made thousands of visits to websites that contain pro-Russian, neo-fascist, and neo-Nazi literature\\" between January 2017 and January 2019. Seven rifles, two shotguns, four pistols, two revolvers, and two silencers, along with magazines and ammunition and the opioid tramadol, were found in his home. Guilty plea and sentencing Federal prosecutors wrote that Hasson intended \\"to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country\\" and described him as \\"a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life.\\" On February 27, 2019, Hasson was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of unlawful possession of silencers; possession of firearms by a drug addict and unlawful use; and possession of a controlled substance (specifically, tramadol). U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles B. Day initially ordered Hasson to be granted pretrial release, on strict bail conditions, including home confinement at his wife's parents' home with GPS monitoring. However, prosecutors appealed this decision and it was immediately reversed by U.S. District Court Judge George J. Hazel, who ordered that Hasson continue to be detained pending trial, citing the potential dangers to the community. Hazel stated that the government's evidence showed that Hasson has specifically planned an attack based on the 2011 massacre in Norway perpetrated by Anders Behring Breivik, and had acquired weapons and ammunition with the purpose of furthering the planned attack. Hasson initially pleaded not guilty, but in October 2019 entered a guilty plea to three charges: possession of tramadol without a prescription and illegal possession of firearms and the firearm silencers. (Under U.S. federal law, a person who is a \\"unlawful user and addict of a controlled substance\\" is prohibited from owning firearms). Hasson admitted that, from 2016 to 2019, he ordered at least 4,650 tramadol pills over the Internet, and admitted that he knowingly possessed firearm silencers that \\"were not registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, and that they did not have serial numbers, as required by law.\\" In court filings in sentencing, prosecutors wrote that \\"If not for the diligent efforts of multiple federal law enforcement agencies, we now would be counting the bodies of the defendant's victims instead of years of the defendant's prison time.\\" In contrast, Masson's defense attorneys argued that Hasson was not a danger to society, and his crimes and fixation \\"on the notion of ethnic cleansing in the United States and that the country should be turned into a white homeland\\" arose from his longstanding opioid use disorder, which Hasson developed after becoming addicted to painkillers in the 2010s. On January 31, 2020, Judge Hazel sentenced Hasson to 160 months (a little over 13 years) in prison, followed by four years' supervised release. Hasson's defense attorneys filed a notice of appeal on February 11, 2020, asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to review his case. He is serving his sentence at the FCI Butner Medium with BOP# 64544-037. Reactions President Donald Trump reacted to the attempted attack by Hasson stating \\"I think it's a shame\\" and that it was \\"a very sad thing\\". Joe Scarborough, one of the people targeted in Hasson's list, accused Trump of inspiring Hasson and stated: \\"This is pretty simple. It's all on the president's shoulders. It's all the president's fault.\\" Former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele accused Trump of silence on Hasson, stating \\"I guess I kind of at this point have reached the 'my glass is no longer half-full,' it's just overflowing with all the crazy that comes out of Trump. Why would we be surprised that a self-proclaimed nationalist would not speak out against a self-proclaimed white nationalist? Why are we acting like this is a space that Donald Trump is gonna go in on behalf of the American ideal? No, he's not. ... These are his people, alright? And he's not gonna thank law enforcement because he's probably not happy about what law enforcement did.\\" Vegas Tenold, author of the book Everything You Love Will Burn: Inside the Rebirth of White Nationalism wrote an op-ed on The Guardian titled \\"The neo-Nazi plot against America is much bigger than we realize\\" about Hasson and other far-right domestic terrorists. Hasson's rights to Coast Guard benefits and retirement pay were terminated following his conviction, and Coast Guard Commandant Karl L.

A removable insulation blanket is a cover made from layers of thermal insulation materials that is fastened onto a mechanical component to maximize its efficiency, regulate its temperature, and improve workplace safety. Using such blankets ensures that the covered component is easily accessible and serviceable, unlike traditional stay-in-place insulation. Removable insulation blankets are also known as removable insulation pads, removable insulation covers, and removable insulation jackets. Removable insulation blankets can be installed on many indoor and outdoor components such as boilers, steam traps, pipes, valves, flanges, and more. They are typically used to prevent heat from escaping hot components; however, they can also be used to prevent freezing or warming of cold components. The insulation materials used vary based on environmental external temperatures, internal operating temperatures, and more.  Types  There are several types of removable insulation blankets. The most common are: * Removable insulation blankets for hot components: used to prevent heat from escaping components by covering the surface of component with insulation materials that slow the transfer of heat. * Removable insulation blankets for cold components: used to prevent external heat from affecting a chilled pipe. Also used to prevent condensation from forming on pipes, known as pipe sweating, which can damage components and create a hazardous work environment. * Removable insulation blankets for freeze prevention: used to prevent subfreezing temperatures from affecting an indoor or outdoor component or pipe. Freeze damage can be costly and time consuming to repair, as often the only solution is to let the component thaw. * Removable insulation blankets for sound attenuation: used to quiet noisy components that are disruptive or dangerous . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has safety regulations on decibel exposure to employees.  Design & Function   Design  Most removable insulation blankets follow a similar design process that begins by taking measurement of the component being insulated. Next, appropriate insulation materials are selected . Once a pattern is designed to snugly fit the component, the selected noncombustible materials are layered and cut to exact measurements using specialized precision cutting technology. Then, they are sewn together by an industrial sewing machine. Finally, fasteners such as straps, D-rings, and hook and loop are installed to enable the removable insulation blanket to remain in place.  Function  Insulation is achieved by slowing the transfer of thermal energy (heat) to or from a component. This is achieved by insulating the component with materials that have a high r-value, which measures how well a material resists conductive flow of heat. The external layer of a removable insulation blanket is typically durable, made with a material like Silicone or Teflon, to protect the component from the elements. The touch temperature of the component is lowered to a safer temperature, which prevents workplace injury.  Materials  The materials used in the design of removable insulation blankets vary based on the type. Some of the most commonly used materials used include: * PTFE Laminates * Silicone Coated Fiberglass Composite * EJ 1650 / PTFE Fiberglass Composite * Kevlar (threading) *Fiberglas UtiliCore¬Æ *Temp Mat *Pyrogel XT-E *Ceramic Paper  Benefits  Removable insulation blankets provide many benefits including: * Reduced Energy Costs: an immediate reduction of energy usage follows the installation of removable insulation blankets. This helps facility managers to meet their energy performance goals. Removable insulation blankets are optimal for buildings with high steam consumption. * Safer Work Environment: removable insulation blankets reduce the touch temperature of pipes and components. The ambient air room temperature is also significantly reduced. This prevents unwanted worker injuries. * Better Asset Management: a large facility can have over 500 components requiring insulation. Tags with QR codes attached to the removable insulation blankets allow facility managers to track their maintenance more easily. * Better Regular Maintenance: removable insulation blankets can be temporarily removed to allow the component or pipe underneath to be serviced. Traditional stay-in-place insulation is often damaged or removed during maintenance and not replaced. *Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions: fewer BTUs consumed as a result of removable insulation blankets means less carbon dioxide emissions.

He is known for identifying the cellular protein used as a receptor by Ebola virus, for defining the entry pathway that rabies virus uses to enter neurons, and for identifying the ribosome as a possible target for antiviral drugs. In July 2019, he was announced as the new Chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. In February 2020, Whelan was recognized as the LGBTQ+ Scientist of the Year 2020 by the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals.  Education  Whelan received a First Class Honors degree in Microbiology and Biochemistry from the University of Birmingham. He performed his PhD work with noted virologist Jeffrey Almond, then at the University of Reading.  Career  Whelan joined Harvard Medical School's Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in 2002. He was promoted to Professor of Microbiology and Immunobiology in 2012. He served as head of Harvard's PhD Program in Virology, and directed an NIH-funded Center for Excellence in Translational Research. In July 2019, Washington University in St. Louis announced that Whelan had been named Chair of the Department of Molecular Microbiology and the Marvin A. Brennecke Distinguished Professor of Microbiology at Washington University School of Medicine. Whelan's research focuses on using Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model system for negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as the rabies, measles and Ebola viruses. He began this work as a post-doc in the laboratory of Professor Gail Wertz, developing a system for expressing infectious VSV particles from cDNA clones, which led to a patent on VSV-based gene therapy vectors and vaccines. VSV pseudotypes, which carry the envelope proteins of other viruses, are useful tools for studying the behavior of pathogenic viruses. Whelan has used this approach to study the entry process of Ebola, to identify the cellular protein the virus uses as a receptor, and to study how the rabies virus infects neurons. Whelan also studies the viral life cycle of VSV to identify potential antiviral targets. He identified a specific subunit of the ribosome, RPL40, as being essential to initiate translation of VSV mRNAs. This selective mechanism allows the virus to block translation of host mRNAs without preventing the production of its own proteins. Interfering with this mechanism could lead to antiviral therapies. With Stephen C. Harrison, he used cryo-EM to determine the structure of the L protein of VSV, revealing several potential drug targets. Advocacy As a founding member of the group \\"Scientists for Science\\", Whelan has argued that research into infectious pathogens is \\"essential for a comprehensive understanding of microbial disease pathogenesis, prevention and treatment\\", and that further regulation of work on dangerous pathogens should only be considered in the context of \\"input from outside experts with the background and skills to conduct actual risk assessments based on specific experiments and existing laboratories\\".

She was last seen by her cousin near the railroad overpass on Highway 16 outside of Gitsegukla. Sampare's cousin, who was walking with her, went to get a jacket or a bike from his home and when he came back Sampare was gone. Despite the police and local community searching nearby areas for her for the 8 days following her disappearance, their efforts proved unsuccessful. She has not been seen since. Despite multiple theories surrounding what could have led to her disappearance, there has been no conclusive evidence to back any of them up.  Background  Sampare was born on September 10, 1953, into a First Nations family of Gitxsan descent. Her birth location and parents' names are not public knowledge. She is the second youngest of six children. Her siblings are Anne, Winnie, Sandra, Virginia and Rod, with Sandra being the youngest. Sampare attended high school in Hazelton, British Columbia. When she was older, she worked in a cannery and as a caretaker for her siblings. She lived with her parents in Gitsegukla. Rod described their parents as very strict and watchful; the children were not allowed to play after 9 and their parents made them work hard. Sampare was planning to move to Terrace with Rod later in the month that she went missing. She worked at the Royal Packing Company salmon canning plant in Claxton and was described as a healthy, normal 18-year-old woman.  Personality  Growing up, Sampare was described as a shy, quiet child who sang teasing songs to her siblings. She loved to play \\"nurse\\" with her siblings and would take turns with Winnie being the nurse. Sampare would often let someone know of her plans, and it was out of character for her to leave unannounced. She volunteered as a caretaker for her siblings, protecting them when their father drank too much. Rod described her as quiet and \\"strong, very strong,\\" and said that she had a promising future as a \\"fair-headed\\" girl. Rod explained in an inquiry that Sampare was careful and did not partake in any high-risk activities.  Relationship status  Sampare's boyfriend, who also had worked at the canning plant, had gone missing shortly before she disappeared. His remains were found after Sampare disappeared. He had drowned in the Skeena River.  Identifying characteristics  Sampare has dark hair and eyes.  Personal items at time of disappearance  There is no public record regarding the items which Sampare had taken with her when she went missing. Though it was a cold night, she had left her jacket at home.  Disappearance  The night of the disappearance, October 14, 1971, Rod's wife, Violet, testified that she saw Sampare at Sampare's mother's house. Violet said that Sampare's mother came home and went into the kitchen; soon after Sampare came out of the kitchen and looked like she was crying. Sampare was avoiding eye contact with Violet. Asking what was wrong, Violet said that Sampare went straight to the door, opened the door and walked out. Violet tried to call Sampare and ask where she was going. Violet tried to get Sampare, but her mother-in-law stopped her, saying that \\"She'll come back\\". Violet said that this was between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm. Alvin \\"Hyrams\\" (Hyzims?), Sampare's cousin, was reported to be the last person to have seen her. He was walking with Sampare alongside Highway 16 when he left to either get a jacket or a bike and then rejoin her. Alvin believed at the time that Sampare was going to a store that was close to the railroad overpass outside of town. Alvin's house was close to where he parted from Sampare, just south of the highway. Violet reported that Alvin came back to the highway and heard a vehicle door close, but Sampare was nowhere to be seen. After Sampare did not return home that night, her mother reported her missing the next morning to the Gitsegukla Indian Band office in Gitsegukla. Someone at the band office mistakenly said that they had to wait a certain amount of time before reporting the disappearance to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Even after waiting and rather than reporting it, the band office sent someone to South Hazelton and Kitimat to see if she was with her sisters Winnie or Anna, but she was not. After talking with Sampare's friends, some of them in Kispiox, they went to the RCMP.  Investigation  On October 16, the RCMP took a missing person's report from Sampare's mother. The RCMP checked with Anna, Winnie, and Sampare's friends and other family and confirmed that no one had made contact with her since she was last seen by Alvin. The police never found any leads or further information that was ever released to the public. The RCMP reported to Rod that the case was closed in 1985, citing a report from the Gitsegukla band Chief Councillor in 1971 that Sampare had drowned; an assertion for which there was no conclusive evidence. The case was subsequently re-opened after the family complained. The RCMP also took DNA from Sampare's siblings around 2006. The family believed that this was in response to the Robert Pickton investigation. Nothing was reported publicly as to whether this produced any further leads in the case. At one point Rod claimed that he saw part of the RCMP file on Sampare, which indicated that a man named Kenny Russell saw her footprints next to the river, leading to the presumption that she went in. Rod asked for a copy of the complete file but was refused.  Search effort  For eight days after she went missing, police and community members searched for her. The village initiated the search and the RCMP joined in later with a police dog from Peace River and officers from other towns. A base of operations for the search was set up, where searchers were coordinated and fed by volunteers. The search stopped when an early snow fell. Sampare's parents started up the search again soon after the snow; the police followed suit. The bushes and bank along the Skeena River and its tributaries in the area were searched from Kitselas Canyon, downstream of Gitsegukla, to points upstream of Gitsegukla. The family also did some spot searches around major cities such as Vancouver and Toronto, usually after receiving a tip. Nothing worth noting publicly was found in these searches.  Gitsegukla geography  Gitsegukla is a village located in the Skeena Valley between Hazelton and Kitwanga, British Columbia. It is in the center of the Hazelton mountain group. The area is largely mountainous with the Skeena River and some of its tributaries running through it. Topsoil is sparse, with a sandstone/shale bedrock exposed or just below the soil surface in much of the area above the Skeena, and sand, gravel and clay with exposed bedrock near and under the Skeena River. Animals in the area include salmon, trout, eagle, ravens, robins, black bears, elk, lynx, owl, coyotes, wolves and deer. There are numerous mines in the area; some were active in the 1970s, but many of them were abandoned shaft-mines. Gitsegukla is located on an Indian reserve in traditional Gitxsan territory. The band operates out of Gitsegukla.  Awareness effort  Both Winnie and Rod Sampare have talked to the media about their sister's disappearance and they spoke along with Victoria at an inquiry on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in September 2017. There were a few newspaper articles referencing her disappearance and the search effort in 1971. Other than this, there is no public record of missing posters or any other media that went out surrounding the disappearance.  Theories  It is not publicly known what happened to Sampare. Her band at one time had tried to list her as being deceased; however, after pushback from Sampare's mother, they changed her status back to missing.  Accident, suicide or animal attack  Rod said that a man named Kenny Russell had found some footprints near Gitsegukla River, with the implication being that Sampare fell into the river. This theory has been dispelled by Sampare's family because there was no evidence that the footprints were Sampare's or that they have ever been confirmed as footprints, considering the shoreline where they were found is mainly stone. In addition to this, Sampare's parents raised her to know not to commit suicide; instilling this attitude in both her and her siblings frequently. Although Sampare may have been under stress from the disappearance of her boyfriend and the altercation with her mother, there is no public knowledge of a suicide note or any indication that she was suicidal. There is no publicly known evidence that Sampare was attacked by an animal.  Runaway  There is no public record of Sampare ever running away before her disappearance. In fact, her sister Winnie stated publicly that Sampare did not partake in high- risk activities. Although she may have been under stress, it was not in her nature to break contact with her relations so abruptly and for such a prolonged period of time, and Sampare always told someone her plans. In addition to this, though it was a cold night, Sampare left her jacket at home, which indicated that she was not planning on being outside for long.  Foul play  Neither Sampare's family nor the RCMP have ruled out foul play in her disappearance; they have not proven foul play either. There is no strong evidence that Sampare had a misadventure or committed suicide, and Sampare leaving behind her jacket on that cold night was evidence against the theory that Ginny ran away. Also, Alvin's report that he heard a vehicle door close just before he was expecting to meet up with Sampare supports the theory that she was taken by vehicle.  Friends or associates  There is no public record that either Sampare's friends or associates had any reason to cause her disappearance.  Stranger  There is no public record that Sampare met a stranger who caused her disappearance.  Highway of Tears  Sampare went missing one year, almost to the day, after Helen Claire Frost, who disappeared on Tuesday, October 13, 1970, and three years before Monica Ignas, who disappeared on Friday, December 13, 1974. Frost disappeared from Prince George, British Columbia, and Ignas from Thornhill, British Columbia. The three cases are some of the first in a series of murders and disappearances upon what would later be called the Highway of Tears.

The fire started in a road accident between a pickup van and a private car. After the collision, the car's gas cylinder exploded. The fire then spread to a group of buildings being used to store chemicals, and quickly expanded to nearby buildings in the densely packed historic district of Chowk Bazaar in Old Dhaka. The fire left at least 80 people dead and 50 others injured. Cause The fire was reported to have originated in the explosion of a cylinder of compressed natural gas in a vehicle, which quickly triggered further fires in buildings and nearby gas cylinders. The blaze was first reported at 22:38, and was reported to be under control by about 03:00. The first building to burn housed shops and a warehouse storing plastic goods, cosmetics and perfume on the first floor, with residential housing on upper stories. It spread to the four-storey building behind the Shahi Mosque. From that building, the fire spread to Rajmoni Restaurant and three other buildings in the narrow alley. An electric transformer exploded just after the fire broke out, which demolished several cars parked on the alley. The alley was full of people because of a wedding ceremony in a nearby community centre. Casualties As of 21 February 2019, the death toll was estimated to be at least 80. In addition to those killed, at least 50 people were injured and transported to hospitals with severe burns and lung damage. Reactions Abdul Hamid, the President of Bangladesh, and Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, offered their condolences to the victims of the fire, as did Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad and many others. In the aftermath of the fire, Dhaka South City Corporation Mayor Sayeed Khokon said chemical warehouses would no longer be permitted in the city. Pakistan's Foreign Office Spokesperson expressed deep regret. The United States embassy in Dhaka offered its condolences to the victims of the fire via Twitter.

RCS Libri was a former subsidiary of RCS MediaGroup, but in 2015, most of the book publishing division was sold to Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, with some imprints of RCS Libri, were either sold by RCS MediaGroup or Arnoldo Mondadori Editore as part of an antitrust deal. RCS MediaGroup retained the brand Rizzoli for non-book publishing, while Arnoldo Mondadori Editore has the exclusive rights to use the brand Rizzoli in book publishing. From 2016 to 2017, Rizzoli Libri S.p.A. was further dismantled into subsidiaires and divisions of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore. Rizzoli Libri (trade book section only) became a division of sub-holding company Mondadori Libri S.p.A., while Rizzoli Education S.p.A. became a subsidiary of Mondadori Libri S.p.A.; The international subsidiaries of the former Rizzoli Libri S.p.A.: Rizzoli International Publications and Rizzoli Bookstore, became the subsidiaries of Mondadori Electa S.p.A., itself a subsidiary of Mondadori Libri S.p.A.. Rizzoli International also operated the new brand Rizzoli Electa. History Predecessors BUR logo RCS Libri S.p.A. was a subsidiary and the book publishing division of RCS MediaGroup (RCS stands for Rizzoli‚ÄìCorriere della Sera); ' itself means books in Italian. A. Rizzoli & C. was founded by Angelo Rizzoli, a former printing apprentice. The company acquired 4 magazines to become a publishing company in 1927. A. Rizzoli & C. soon started to publish books, such as involved in the printing of Treccani Encyclopedia from 1929. The group founded the imprint (BUR) in 1949. In the 1960s, the group started to open their own book store, including a branch in the New York city, as well as sister operation Rizzoli International Publications. The group was expanded into RCS MediaGroup after the acquisition of the newspaper Corriere della Sera in 1974. In 1990, the group acquired Fabbri‚ÄìSonzogno‚ÄìEtas, another publishing group. In 1993 RCS Media Group acquired the full control of Fabbri‚ÄìSonzogno‚ÄìEtas. Fabbri, , and Etas became the imprints of the group in publication. In 1992, RCS Media Group acquired , which gave birth of the two brands Sansoni and Sansoni per la Scuola. In 1993, RCS MediaGroup acquired Bompiani. Establishment of RCS Libri S.p.A. The division RCS Libri & Grandi Opere was established in 1994, which included the imprints such as Fabbri. In 1998, RCS Libri acquired the textbook publisher Tramontana, merging with the group's existing textbook publishing business. In 2000, the group acquired Sfera Editore (a magazine publisher), (from De Michelis family) as well as French publisher Editions Flammarion. RCS MediaGroup became the largest book publisher in Italy after the deals. However, a decade later, RCS Libri sold Flammarion in 2012 for ‚Ç¨251 million. In 2007, Italian Competition Authority started an investigation on 9 publishing companies, including RCS Libri, for an alleged anti-competitive conduct in textbook market. On 9 December 2013, the group signed an agreement with Telecom Italia on e-books and online edition of newspapers. It also included the ebooks of the imprints of RCS Libri at that time: Rizzoli, Bompiani, Fabbri, Adelphi, , Marsilio, Skira, and Sonzogno. RCS Media Group also sold the equity interest (48%) in the imprint Editions d'Art Albert Skir√† (or known as Skira group) on 11 December 2013. Immediately after the transaction, RCS Libri, via Rizzoli International, still owned 49% stake of Skira Rizzoli Publications Inc., which was based in New York. Before the sales of Skira group, the imprint Skira Rizzoli was considered within the scope of consolidation. According to Publishers Weekly, the division RCS Libri had a revenue of ‚Ç¨513.3 million in the financial year 2011 (not adjusted for the sale of Flammarion in 2012), or ‚Ç¨298.6 million if excluding Flammarion. It was decreased to ‚Ç¨273.3 million in 2012 and then ‚Ç¨252 million in 2013 and ‚Ç¨223 million in 2014. Moreover, the whole group was suffered from aggregate net losses in the 2010s, for example in financial years 2012, 2013 and 2014. The net loss was ‚Ç¨218 million in 2013 and ‚Ç¨110.8 million in 2014. The market share of RCS Libri in fiction and non-fiction was 11.8% in 2014, according to Publishers Weekly, itself was quoting the figure from GfK. Acquired by Mondadori group and downsizing as Rizzoli Libri division In February 2015, it was reported that Arnoldo Mondadori Editore (Mondadori group) had submitted a non-binding offer to buy RCS Libri from RCS MediaGroup. It was reported that Rosellina Archinto, founder of the namesake imprint, re-acquired Archinto in July 2015. In October 2015, RCS MediaGroup announced to sell the whole division, with Mondadori group being the principal buyer, despite some subsidiaries and imprints of RCS Libri, were sold to other investors instead. For example, the controlling stake (58%) of Adelphi was sold to Roberto Calasso, who worked at Adelphi for many years. Furthermore, in March 2016, Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) ruled that Mondadori, after the acquisition, had to sell subsidiaries and imprints Bompiani, Marsilio Editori and Sonzogno. Marsilio (including the imprint Sonzogno) was sold back to De Michelis family's GEM S.r.l. while Bompiani was sold to Giunti Editore. Mondadori group retained the brands such as Rizzoli (in books only), BUR and Fabbri Editori. It also owned . In April 2016, immediately after the takeover, RCS Libri S.p.A. was renamed to Rizzoli Libri S.p.A.. Rizzoli Libri S.p.A. was under Mondadori Libri S.p.A., a business unit of Mondadori group. At the time of the foundation in 2014, Mondadori Libri S.p.A. was the sub-holding company of the subsidiaries and imprints Piemme, Giulio Einaudi, Mondadori Education, Mondadori Electa, Sperling & Kupfer as well as joint venture Harlequin Mondadori. Rizzoli Libri S.p.A. was further downsized by the transfer of the ownership of the overseas subsidiary Rizzoli International Publications to Mondadori Electa, with the section of Rizzoli Libri S.p.A. was merged into direct parent company Mondadori Libri S.p.A.. Mondadori Libri also absorbed Sperling & Kupfer S.p.A. and Edizioni Piemme S.p.A. on 1 January 2017. They were retained as division and imprints of Mondadori Libri. The trade book area of Mondadori Libri (including the imprint Rizzoli) and the textbook subsidiary and imprint Rizzoli Education, since 2018, were also under different corporate leadership, Enrico Selva Codd√® and Antonio Porro respectively. They were the Managing Directors () of Mondadori Libri. According to the publication of Mondadori group, the direct parent company of Rizzoli Education had also changed to aforementioned Mondadori Libri. According to GfK, as of financial year 2018, the downsized Rizzoli Libri had a market share of 4.8% (decreased from 4.9% year to yearly) in trade books, with the whole Mondadori group had a market share of 27.4% (decreased from 30.0% year to yearly). Former subsidiaries  Rizzoli Education Logo of Rizzoli Education , formerly Rizzoli Education, was a division of Rizzoli Libri S.p.A.. After the trade book section of Rizzoli Libri S.p.A. was absorbed into Mondadori Libri S.p.A. in 2017, Rizzoli Education S.p.A. was retained as a subsidiary of aforementioned Mondadori Libri. In 2016, the first year of the acquisition of Rizzoli Libri group, Rizzoli Education and Mondadori group's existing subsidiary Mondadori Education, had a combined share of 24% in Italian textbook market, according to Publishers Weekly which itself quoting the figures from Mondadori group. In 2019, Oxford University Press and Rizzoli Education renewed an agreement on distributing books. Oxford University Press signed the first agreement with in 1978, now a brand of Rizzoli Education. Rizzoli Education also used other imprints such as Fabbri Editori (acquired by RCS Libri in 1990), Tramontana (acquired in 2000), Sansoni per la Scuola (acquired in 1992), Etas (acquired in 1990), Rizzoli Languages, Calderini, Edagricole, Edizioni del Quadrifoglio and Markes.  Rizzoli International Publications RCS Libri, via RCS International Books B.V., had an overseas subsidiary Rizzoli International Publications Inc., also known as Rizzoli New York or Rizzoli USA. The company was based in New York City, the United States. Rizzoli International acquired the imprint Welcome Books. Inc., from Welcome Enterprises in 2014. The American division also contained Rizzoli Bookstore, which was located in NoMad, New York City since 2015. After the 2016 takeover of RCS Libri, both Rizzoli International and Rizzoli Bookstore are now part of Mondadori group. However, the intermediate parent company was changed from RCS Libri to Mondadori Electa, another subsidiary of Mondadori group. As of 2019, Rizzoli International Publications also owned the imprints Ex Libris (established in 2011) and Universe Publishing (established in 1990). Mondadori group launched the imprint Rizzoli Electa in January 2018, but the international illustrated department of Rizzoli Libri, would be integrated into fellow division Mondadori Electa. The brand Rizzoli Electa would be operated by Mondadori Electa instead. Or in other words, the international division of Rizzoli Libri, as well as future publication that under Rizzoli brand in English language (as Rizzoli Electa), would be operated by Mondadori Electa instead. Mondadori Electa also owned imprint Rizzoli Illustrati Italia at that time. Despite the parent companies of Rizzoli International sold the publishing companies Flammarion (in 2012 by RCS MediaGroup) and Marsilio (in 2016 by Mondadori group), Rizzoli International still distributed the books by the two imprints.

They were based in London around the release of their debut album. Self described as post-punk, with motorik elements of krautrock and noise pop, the band blends this sound with elements of neo-psychedelia. The band have released two album, Means in 2016 and Into Red in 2019.  History  FEWS were formed in 2014 by David Alexander Lomelino and Frederick Rundquist. Both had previously been involved in electronic/pop projects in Sweden, although Rundquist is originally from San Francisco \\\\- Lomelino working under the pseudonym Summer Heart, and Rundquist was a member of Sameblod with Mikael Mattisson. Both acts were signed to Swedish record label Sommarhjarta. Reportedly meeting via MySpace, Summer Heart appeared on Sameblod's album Braided Memos in 2012, and in 2014 remixed the song Loud by Sameblod , and the song Suddenly which was released on the band's Suddenly Remix EP. The duo enlisted bassist Alexander Blomfeldt and drummer Rasmus Andersson, who was previously a guitarist. The band submitted a demo of The Zoo to PIAS Recordings, and signed soon after. The band released their debut single Ill in June 2015 via UK label Speedy Wunderground, after English record producer Dan Carey got in touch with the band. On 20 May 2016, the band released their debut studio album Means via PIAS. The album was preceded by 2 singles proper: \\"The Zoo\\" which was released in November 2015 and \\"100 Goosebumps\\" in March 2016, and \\"Drinking Games\\" in May 2016. The band's original bassist Alexander Blomfeldt left the band on the last day of recording in London, returning to Sweden. Commenting on his departure, Rundquist stated \\"he's still one of my best friends but he wants to do the normal things in life like buy a house, buy a car and have a family\\". He was replaced by English bassist Jay Clifton in March 2016. After a one-year hiatus, the band returned in August 2018 with the release of a new single called \\"Business Man\\". The band released their second album Into Red on 1 March 2019.

The contemporary activity of the port is centered in the obtention of provisions by the local market, in vessel supplies, the ferry service linking to ports in the Iberian Peninsula and its role as centre for providing logistic and industrial services.

S. Kenyon or Stephen Kenyon was an Australian civil engineer and polymath. History Kenyon was born in Homebush, Victoria, the only son of Alfred Henderson Kenyon (c. 1837 ‚Äì 15 September 1921) and his wife Agnes Fleming Kenyon, n√©e Agnew ( ‚Äì 10 December 1919). Kenyon's father started in Australia as a farmer in the Wimmera district, later a bookseller and dealer in artists' materials, chess enthusiast and amateur historian Kenyon was home-schooled for his early education. Then in 1881 the family moved to Highett Street, Richmond, and he enrolled at nearby St Stephen's Grammar School, and in 1884 he entered Ormond College, Melbourne University, to study civil engineering. He joined the Victorian Public Works Department in 1887, and the following year was appointed to the Victorian Water Supply Department, where he was responsible for water supply works in the northern Mallee regions. Later he was engineer-in-charge in the opening up of the Middle Mallee, organising the water supply for North Mallee, and, later The Great War, of clearing the Red Cliffs irrigation area for repatriation of returned soldiers. He also supervised the construction of other works, including the Goulburn levees and works at Koo-Wee-Rup, Cardinia, Tresco, Mystic Park, Merbein, and Nyah. In 1932 Kenyon was appointed a commissioner of the Victorian Water Supply Commission.

In the , Myall Creek had a population of 38 people.  History  By 1837 European settlers had pushed beyond the Peel and Namoi Rivers and taken up large tracts of land along the Gwydir River or the \\"Big River\\" as it was then known. Local Gamilaroi groups resisted the alienation of their traditional lands almost immediately. The dispersed nature of the settlers stations enabled the Gamilaroi to easily isolate and attack stockmen and their livestock.Connor 2020:105 In April 1836 two stockmen working for the Hall Brothers, were killed while forming a new station. In September and November of the following year two hutkeepers and two shepherds from the Bowman and Cobb stations were killed.Reece 1974:29 Crown Land Commissioner Alexander Paterson reported back to Sydney in the second half of 1837 that stockmen on the Loder station, which was the westernmost station on the Namoi, were so afraid of raids by the Gamilaroi that they had abandoned their livestock to roam unattended in the bush.Connor 2002:105 Liverpool Plains settlers demanded military protection against Aboriginal attacks. In response to their demands, Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, Acting Governor of New South Wales sent a large Mounted Police party north to enquire into and repress the aggressions complained of. The Mounted Police party, led by Major Nunn and composed of around twenty troopers reached Liverpool Plains in January 1838. What occurred after they arrived remains unclear, but at Waterloo Creek, 50 kilometres southwest of what is now Moree, the Mounted Police encountered a large party of Aboriginal people camped alongside the Creek. In the ensuing melee a number of Aboriginal people were shot in what became known as the Waterloo Creek massacre. The exact number of Aboriginal people killed in the melee is unknown but local squatters who visited site later, reported the number killed to be sixty or seventy. An eyewitness to the encounter testified that forty to fifty may have been killed. Rev Threlkeld in his mission report for 1838 stated that the number may have been as high as two or three hundred.Connor 2002:110-111; Reece 1974:33 According to R. H. W. Reece in his book \\"Aborigines and Colonists,\\" local tradition states that Nunn's party of Mounted Police was involved in at least one more large melee with local Aboriginal people before the party left the Plains. Major Nunn's Campaign (as it was known in the district) did not prevent further racial conflict. In March of that year two men working for Surveyor Finch were killed in the neighbouring district of New England, then in April a hutkeeper on the Gwydir was killed. In the following months stockmen from stations along the Gwydir River organised themselves into armed groups and scoured the country side in what is described by Reece as \\"a concerted campaign to get rid of all the Aborigines in the district.\\" According to Reece this still known in local tradition as \\"The Bushwhack\\" or \\"The Drive\\".Reece 1974: 34 The Myall Creek Massacre took place in June of that year, on Myall Creek Station near the Gwydir River. The twelve men responsible for the massacre included freed convicts and assigned convicts, led by John Fleming, the manager of the Mungie Bundie Station. The original party assembled at Bengari on a station owned by Archibald Bell before they set off and were joined by the remaining members somewhere along the Gwydir River.Elder 1988: 74-75 After spending the day unsuccessfully pursuing Aborigines the group came to the Myall Creek Station. They discovered approximately 30 Aborigines belonging to the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay peoples on the station, rounded them up and tied them together. When the station hand, George Anderson asked what they intended to do with the Aborigines he was told they were taking them over the back of the range to frighten them. A few minutes later the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay were led off and massacred. Two days later the men returned to burn the bodies.Elder 1988:78 The impact of the massacre on the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay peoples was devastating. As one of the descendants whose great-great-great-grandfather survived the massacre states 'We didn't want to talk about it because of how dreadful it was I remember when we used to drive past that place. It just had a feeling about it that I can't explain'.Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2001 The Myall Creek massacre was marked by the unusual circumstance that one of the station hands who did not participate in the massacre, George Anderson, informed the station manager, William Hobbs, who reported the incident to the local magistrate. The reports by Anderson and Hobbs were not without danger, as the inquiry of magistrate Edward Day noted \\"[I] took George Anderson with [me], believing that [his] life would be in danger if he remained at Myall Creek\\".Day as cited by Wannan 1962:203 In response to the charging of the eleven suspects settlers formed groups such as the \\"Black Association\\" to support the men charged with the murder. Papers such as the Sydney Herald protested against the trials.Barber 1993 Charging the perpetrators of the massacre also stimulated the activism of religious and humanitarian groups who called for the execution of the perpetrators.Rowley 1970:36-37 These views were promoted through papers such as the Sydney Monitor and the Australian. Upon being found not guilty, seven of the men were re-arrested and tried for the murder of an Aboriginal male named Charley.(R v Kilmeister No. 2 - http://www.law.mq.edu.au). The second trial resulted in a guilty verdict and all seven men were sentenced to death. Governor Gipps later wrote that none of the seven attempted to deny their crime, though all stated they thought it extremely hard that white men should be put to death for killing blacks.H.R.A Vol XIX:739 On 18 December 1838, after all legal objections were exhausted and the Executive Council rejected petitions for clemency, the sentences were carried out.

A graduate of the College of the City of New York at 17 years old, Wright taught in New Jersey for three years. After his arrival in Chicago while looking for a job, Wright found odd jobs such as assisting a Pullman porter, working as a real estate office assistant and working in the registry department of the post office. He soon caught the eye of local elected officials, and was hired into the county clerk‚Äôs office. Wright participated in the 1888 Republican National Convention, which was hosted in Chicago, and was rewarded for his work by being hired as bookkeeper and railroad incorporation clerk in the secretary of state‚Äôs office, the first African- American to be appointed to a clerical position in state government. After Secretary Isaac N. Pearson's term ended, Wright left his position to work in the Chicago city clerk‚Äôs office for two years. He was then elected 1895 for a one-year term as South Town clerk, and helped secure the 1894 election of Theodore W. Jones as Cook County commissioner, the second African-American to be elected to the commission (and a relative of John Jones, the first African- American elected to the commission in 1872). By 1896, Wright became the third African-American county commissioner, and was also admitted to the bar that same year. As county commissioner, Wright continued to gain work for other African-Americans in Chicago, including Ferdinand Lee Barnett as the first African American assistant state‚Äôs attorney for Cook County. Upon being re- elected to the county commission in 1898, he secured election as president pro-tem of the body. However, after he failed to be re-elected in 1900, Wright spent the next fifteen years confined largely to activism for racial equality in Republican county committee meetings. When William Hale Thompson joined the race for mayor in 1915, Wright helped secure pledge cards for Thompson. After Thompson's election, he rewarded Wright with the position of assistant corporation counsel with a salary higher than any other African-American appointee. Wright took over Alderman Oscar Stanton De Priest's position as an organizational leader for Thompson's campaigns for senator and mayor, and was then appointed by Thompson as one of the attorneys for the Traction Commission in 1919. Wright gained increased political power when he was elected Republican committeeman of the Second Ward, a position which allowed him to nominate African-American state senators, state representatives and municipal judges and send delegates to Republican conventions. His most potent feat was nominating Albert George as a municipal judge in 1924. Wright's political continued until he and Thompson, who ran again for mayor in 1926, had a falling out over the nomination of a First Ward Republican committeeman. Wright backed a different candidate than Thompson, but the former's candidate lost, and Wright left politics altogether. Wright moved to Rochester, Minnesota, where he died in 1930.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Stephen, to the northeast. Mount Burgess is six kilometres north on the opposite side of the Kicking Horse River valley. Mount Dennis has over of vertical relief above Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway, which traverses the northwest foot of the mountain.  History The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1887 by James J. McArthur of the Dominion Land Survey. The mountain was named in 1916 by Alexander MacKinnon Burgess for Lieutenant-Colonel John Stoughton Dennis (1820‚Äì1885), a Canadian surveyor who proposed the Dominion Land Survey system in 1869. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount Dennis is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Dennis is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Weather conditions during winter make Mount Dennis one of the premier places in the Rockies for ice climbing. Precipitation runoff from Mount Dennis drains into tributaries of the Kicking Horse River which is a tributary of the Columbia River.

The main building is from 1804 but was adapted to the Renaissance Revival style in the second half of the 19th century. The Baroque-style garden is open to the public. History The manor was established by Morten Venstermand in the middle of the 16th century. His widow, Anne Andersdatter Galt, brought S√∏holt into her second marriage to Falk Axelsen Brahe. He struggled with economic difficulties and therefore chose to sell S√∏holt to his brother-in-law Eiler Quitzow in 1618. Henrik Heest, a nobleman from Holstein, purchased S√∏holt from Quitzow in 1624. In 1637, it was sold by his nephew to Jobst Frederik von Papenheim. Papenheim had shortly after his arrival in Denmark won the favour of the king and had therefore been appointed as squire (kammerjunker) for crown prince Christian. He constructed a new main building in 1647. It consisted of two two-storey, half-timbered buildings. The one to the east was the main wing. The one to the west contained a scullery, washroom and residential quarters for staff. Papenheim's widow Regitze Knudsdatter kept the estate after his death in 1649 but ravaging and looting Swedish troops left it in a poor condition after the Swedish Wars. The reconstruction was financed by pledging the estate. Henning Ulrich von L√ºtzow, acreditor, took over the estate in 1790. L√ºtzow expanded the main building into a three-winged complex in the fashionable Italian style. A chapel was in 1698 inaugurated by Thomas Kingo in the east wing. He also adapted he garden to a more modern garden √† la fran√ßaise design. In 1691, he was appointed as Prefect of Lolland Falster and County Governor of NyK√∏bing County. His luxurious lifestyle was later continued by his son, Christian Frederik von L√ºtzow, who inherited S√∏holt in 1722. The Krogh family Gotske Hans von Krogh His wife, Anna Sophie Holsten, who became a widow in 1759, sold S√∏holt and the other estates to their son-in-la Hans von Krogh. Krogh had no children and in 1784 ceded S√∏holt to his nephew, Godske Hans von Krogh the Younger. After his early death, in 1790, S√∏holt passed to his brother, Caspar Hermann von Krogh, who would however only survive his brother by a year. On his death bed he married his late brother's fianc√©, Elisabeth Catharina Lehn. She was a daughter of Poul Abraham Lehn, Baron of Hvidkilde and Guldborgsund. A few years later, in 1796, she then married Julian Christian von Bertouch, but they would only have five years together since she died kust 20 years old on a journey to Dresden in October 1802. The Bertouch family Ole J√∏rgen Rawert: S√∏holt, 9 August 1820 Bertouch married Louise Juliane von Wallmoden in 1803. He constructed a new main wing between the two main wings in 1804. The couple would later gather many prominent artists and writers on the estate in the summer time, including BBertel Thorvaldsen and Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. Julian Christian and Louise Juliane von Bertouch died just two days apart in September 1831 and S√∏holt was then sold at auction. Later history S√∏holt in 1870 The new owner was Laurits Kierkegaard. In 1852, S√∏holt was again sold at auction. The new owner was Laurits J√∏rgensen. He demolished the two side wings in 1853 and adapted the main wing the following year. He was after his death in 1889 succeeded by his son Henrik J√∏rgensen and then his grandson Poul Christian Clausen J√∏rgensen. In 1917, S√∏holt was acquired by the broker Peter Ole Suhr. He was hit by economic difficulties during the economic crisis and S√∏hholt was therefore, in 1937, taken over by Creditkassen for Landejendomme i √òstifterne. The mortgage fund sold it to Valdemar Henckel, the owner of Kalundborg Shipyard. In 1940, he sold it to Eiler Marcher (1904-1975). Architecture The main building is designed in the Renaissance Revival style with Flammish gables. It is a whitewashed two-storey building with a short cross wing to the east and a short tower to the west. Today S√∏holt is today owned by Frederik von L√ºttichau. The Engestofte-S√∏holt estate covers 937.50 hectares of land.

Maspion, also known as the Maspion Group or simply known as Maspion (stylized as MASPION), is a group of autonomous Indonesian conglomerate and multinational companies, based in Surabaya, East Java. It was founded by Alim Husin in 1962. The company employs around 30,000 people (2016) and has 44 subsidiaries. It has production facilities spread across four industrial areas in Sidoarjo and Gresik, East Java, and one factory in Jakarta and West Java.  History  Maspion was founded in 1962 from a small home industry that produced kitchen equipment, managed by Alim Husin and his partner Gunardi Go. The home business at that time was named UD Logam Djawa. Starting from this small business, the founder started a business that gradually developed into a big industry. This business is developing not only a product that is limited to making kitchen equipment made of aluminum but has expanded to the manufacture of kitchen utensils from plastic. In 1970, Alim Husin's family business progressed so much that he designed a new name and logo under the name Jin Feng (top of gold), and changed the name of the company to MASPION, the Indonesian language short from Mengajak Anda Selalu Percaya Industri Olahan Nasional (\\"Inviting You to Always Trust the National Industry\\"). This is in line with the establishment of a company labeled Maspion since 1971. Three years later, the company began producing PVC pipes and accessories. With this type of business the company's production is increasingly diverse. Since 1975, Maspion has also begun to develop the home electrical appliances business as well as stainless steel kitchen utensils. Maspion Group in expanding its business cooperates with top-class companies, including Samsung, Marubeni, Komatsu, Sumitomo Metals, Kawasaki Steel, Satachi, Seven Seas Chemicals, and Siam Cement. Besides selling domestically, Maspion products are also exported to the United States, Japan, Australia, Europe and the Middle East. Maspion's export value in 1995 reached US$ 100 million dollars.

C. P. Miller. It was originally developed to compute tables of the modified Bessel function but also applies to Bessel functions of the first kind and has other applications such as computation of the coefficients of Chebyshev expansions of other special functions. Many families of special functions satisfy a recurrence relation that relates the values of the functions of different orders with common argument x. The modified Bessel functions of the first kind I_n(x) satisfy the recurrence relation :I_{n-1}(x)=\\\\frac{2n}{x}I_n(x)+I_{n+1}(x). However, the modified Bessel functions of the second kind K_n(x) also satisfy the same recurrence relation :K_{n-1}(x)=\\\\frac{2n}{x}K_n(x)+K_{n+1}(x). The first solution decreases rapidly with n. The second solution increases rapidly with n. Miller's algorithm provides a numerically stable procedure to obtain the decreasing solution. To compute the terms of a recurrence a_0 through a_N according to Miller's algorithm, one first chooses a value M much larger than N and computes a trial solution taking initial conditiona_M to an arbitrary non-zero value (such as 1) and taking a_{M+1} and later terms to be zero. Then the recurrence relation is used to successively compute trial values for a_{M-1}, a_{M-2} down to a_0. Noting that a second sequence obtained from the trial sequence by multiplication by a constant normalizing factor will still satisfy the same recurrence relation, one can then apply a separate normalizing relationship to determine the normalizing factor that yields the actual solution. In the example of the modified Bessel functions, a suitable normalizing relation is a summation involving the even terms of the recurrence: :I_0(x)+2\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty (-1)^mI_{2m}(x)=1 where the infinite summation becomes finite due to the approximation that a_{M+1} and later terms are zero. Finally, it is confirmed that the approximation error of the procedure is acceptable by repeating the procedure with a second choice of M larger than the initial choice and confirming that the second set of results for a_0 through a_N agree within the first set within the desired tolerance. Note that to obtain this agreement, the value of M must be large enough such that the term a_M is small compared to the desired tolerance. In contrast to Miller's algorithm, attempts to apply the recurrence relation in the forward direction starting from known values of I_0(x) and I_1(x) obtained by other methods will fail as rounding errors introduce components of the rapidly increasing solution. Olver and Gautschi analyses the error propagation of the algorithm in detail. For Bessel functions of the first kind, the equivalent recurrence relation and normalizing relationship are : :J_{n-1}(x)=\\\\frac{2n}{x}J_{n}(x)-J_{n+1}(x) :J_0(x)+2\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty J_{2m}(x)=1. The algorithm is particularly efficient in applications that require the values of the Bessel functions for all orders 0 \\\\cdots N for each value of x compared to direct independent computations of N+1 separate functions.

Early days Abdullahi in the early 20th century had business ties with the Zeila, Aden, and various other trading routes south of the red sea, where he built his wealth. He gained the confidence of the Emperor of Ethiopia Menelik II and was sent as an envoy to leader of the Dervish state, Mohammed Abdullah Hassan. Abdullahi was regarded as leader of the Muslims of Harar and helped then governor of Hararghe, Haile Selassie foster good relations between Muslims and Christians within the province. Political career Abdullahi Sadeq (standing far right) and family with Iyasu V of Ethiopia (sitting) He became land administrator in Harar under governor Ras Makonnen in 1889 but was suspended a year later. In 1905 he was leader of the envoy representing emperor Menelik to the United States. In 1906 while visiting British India, he was subsequently arrested by British officers and detained in Zeila. Britain accused Abdullah of supplying weapons to the Dervish State. Abdullahi was assigned governorship of Ogaden by Iyasu V in 1914. Iyasu used Abdullahi to interact with Dervish leader Mohammed Hassan, which would lead to an alliance between the Dervish and Ethiopian Empire. Dervish State at the time had revolted on the British and this concerned UK about the role Abdullahi was playing. British officer Charles Doughty-Wylie claimed Iyasu's appointment of Abdullahi was signs the Ethiopian government was shifting towards an anti British policy. Abdullahi was also accused of being an international pan Islamic conspirator against the British empire, evidenced by his attempts to reach out to the Emir of Afghanistan. According to professor Haggai Erlich Abdullahi was one of the key figures fostering ties with the Ottoman empire to bring Ethiopia into World War I on the side of the Central Powers. Death After the overthrow of Iyasu V, he was arrested in Harar along with several Somali leaders. Abdullahi was later released from prison, however prior to his release he was allegedly poisoned under the orders of Haile Selassie and died in 1920.

In 1966 and at the age of 40, Weiss collaborated with Fred Whitmore and founded Investment Quality Trends, a newsletter. The establishment of Investment Quality Trends marked Weiss as the first women to start an investment advisory service. Confident that she could make Investment Quality Trends successful, Weiss bought out Whitmore and managed the firm by herself. To avoid the perception held by investors that a women could not invest successfully, Weiss signed her newsletter \\"G. Weiss\\" instead of \\"Geraldine Weiss\\" to mask her gender. The newsletter garnered significant success and created a loyal readership that generated profits off of her advice. In 1977, Weiss appeared on the popular talk show \\"Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser\\" and revealed that she was a women. Although this came as a surprise to the readership at Investment Quality Trends, the subscribers \\"were making so much money that they really didn't care\\". Weiss garnered significant popularity throughout the years, earning herself the nickname \\"The Grande Dame of Dividends\\". The work done by Geraldine has been published in illustrious finance publications such as the Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Barron's, and The Wall Street Journall.  Retirement at investment quality trends (2003 - present)  After 36 years of conducting analysis and writing for Investment Quality Trends, Weiss handed off editorial duties at Investment Quality Trends to Kelley Wright. However, Weiss is still involved with the overall business strategy at Investment Quality Trends.  Publications  Weiss is the co-author Dividends Don't Lie: Finding Value in Blue-Chip Stocks (1988) and The Dividend Connection: How Dividends Create Value in the Stock Market (1995).  Dividends Don't Lie: Finding Value in Blue-Chip Stocks (1988)  Dividends Don't Lie: Finding Value in Blue-Chip Stocks was written by Geraldine Weiss and Janet Lowe and published in 1988. The book teaches a value-based approach to investing by using the dividend- yield theory as a means to produce consistent returns in the stock market. Rather than focusing on price cycles, company products, marketing strategy, and other factors, Weiss and Lowe places an emphasis on dividend-yield patterns as a means of evaluating a stock. The book is considered to be \\"the bible for dividend centric value investing\\". A follow-up titled Dividends Still Don't Lie: The Truth About Investing in Blue Chip Stocks and Winning in the Stock Market was published by Kelley Wright, Managing Editor of Investment Quality Trends, in 2010.  The Dividend Connection: How Dividends Create Value in the Stock Market (1995)  The Dividend Connection: How Dividends Create Value in the Stock Market was written by Geraldine Weiss and Gregory Weiss and published in 1995. The book is aimed at providing investors with the self-confidence to make stock market choices without hesitation and uncertainty.  Weiss's investment strategy  Weiss's investment strategy looks closely at a dividend's yield to determine value - a repetitively high yield would indicate an undervalued stock and a repetitively low yield would indicate an overvalued stock. Weiss has seven criteria to screen stocks with: # Whether the dividend yield is undervalued on a historical basis; # Whether the company has raised dividends at an annual compound rate of at least 10% in the past 12 years; # Whether the company is trading at a book value (BV) of two or less; # Whether the company has a P/E ratio of 20-to-1 or less; # Whether the dividend payout ratio is 50% or less; # Whether the debt is 50% or less of the company's total market capitalization; # Whether it meets the six blue chip criteria: (1) Dividends have been raised at least 5 times in the last 12 years, (2) has at least an \\"A\\" rating from S&P;, (3) has at least 5 million shares outstanding, (4) has at least 80 institutional investors that hold the stock, (5) has at least 25 years of consistent dividends, and (6) has shown earnings improvement at least seven times in the last 12 years. When a stock meets all seven of Weiss's criteria, the stock is categorized by Weiss as a \\"Buy\\".

This is a list of characters from the anime and manga series The Quintessential Quintuplets. Main characters Futaro Uesugi ; : :A blunt, friendless highschool student that is very academically gifted. Futaro lives with his sister and father in a small apartment. He is serious and dedicated to his efforts in helping the Nakano sisters improve their grades. He likes dishes that Raiha cooks, but hates raw fish. His favorite drink is barley tea, his favorite animals are gorillas and his daily convention is storing one coin. In his student handbook he keeps a photo of a girl he met in Kyoto while he was in sixth grade, who was his inspiration to study. It is later revealed that she is one of the Nakano Quintuplets. Nakano Quintuplet sisters The sisters are all physically identical with large blue eyes, light-reddish hair, cute expressive faces and shapely figures. Despite their different hairstyles, the sisters are experts at impersonating each other and often do so for pranks or convenience. They were born on May 5 and live together in a rich high-rise apartment and by following the \\"go-toubun\\" (five portions, divided equally) philosophy given by their late mother, consider themselves five parts of one whole. Although they share terrible grades and no desire to study, they can be honorable and appreciate the work that Futaro is dedicating towards them. ; : :The eldest sister, she has short hair without any accessories. Ichika acts like a responsible older sister - she's caring, thoughtful and wise. She enjoys sleeping and her room is incredibly messy. She aspires to become a movie actress and dedicates most of her time and resources to do so, to the point of having to quit schooling in order to focus on her acting career. She likes salted fish but hates mushrooms. Her favorite drink is frappuccino, her favorite animals are hippos, her favorite TV program type is drama, her best subject is mathematics, and her daily hobby is jogging. She falls in love with Futaro and wanted to confess to him, but hearing Nino confessing to Futaro prevented her from doing so. As she grew to accept she wanted Futaro for herself, she became misguided and started using underhanded methods to get closer to him and sabotage her sisters in the process. She used Miku's disguised as a way to \\"cheat\\" her way into his heart, almost sabotaging Miku's chances to confess in the process. It's revealed that she met Futaro 5 years before the start of the story: after Futaro and the girl from the photo (Yotsuba) had spent the entire day together and both went to the inn the quintuplets were staying at, she was interested in him and played cards with him while Yotsuba was gone, with Futaro himself unaware that he was interacting with another quintuplet. She had forgotten about this exchange until they reunited years later, when he put a blond wig as a disguise, resembling the way he looked years ago. After getting called out by Futaro on her schemes and realizing the error of her ways, she helps Miku properly confess to Futaro and decides to stop pursuing her love towards him, lying to him that their moments together were all \\"lies\\". She becomes his guide on his path to accept he was in love and becomes the first quintuplet in knowing his choice. After Futaro's choice at the end of the school festival, she congratulates him and pushes him to be more open with his feelings. 5 years later, she becomes a famous actress around the world. ; : :The second sister, she has very long hair with two butterfly-style accessories on the sides. Due to her poor eyesight, she has been wearing contact lenses for the past three years but still takes five minutes to put them in. Although she is caring and playful with her sisters, she shows a grumpy and somewhat aggressive personality to outsiders. She likes pancakes, but hates tsukemono. Her favorite drink is warm water, her favorite animals are rabbits, her favorite TV program type is variety shows, her best subject is English, and her daily convention is putting on a facial mask and doing yoga. She is also fashionable and skilled at cooking, hinted to have dreams of becoming a chef. She views Futaro as an interloper to the sisters' unique relationship and has gone to extreme, sometimes illegal lengths to ban him from their apartment. She's afraid to be left behind and desires to find her own path, but she's afraid to let go of the past and the dynamic she had with her sisters since they were kids; her problems with Fuutaro comes from the very fact that she sees him as the one changing the status quo she had grown accustomed to, which sometimes generates conflict between her and her sisters. :However, she starts seeing Fuutaro as someone who respects her feelings and one who desires to see the Nakano quintuplets together as a family, melting her heart. After fully realizing her feelings, she becomes the first quintuplet to successfully confess to Futaro, taking a straight-forward approach on her love towards him ever since in order to gain his affection, often clashing with the third sister, Miku, acting like rivals. After Futaro's choice at the end of the school festival, she becomes upset with Yotsuba's consideration of her feelings as she sees it as pity. After a heartfelt exchange, she accepts Yotsuba's resolve, acknowledging her as a rival and warns that she will take any chance on taking Futaro away if their relationship ever falls apart. 5 years later she opens the Nakano Bakery shop with Miku, borrowing the place of the former Uesugi restaurant. ; : :The third sister, she has medium-length hair, \\"emotionless\\" eyes and normally a specific pair of headphones around her neck. She has a quiet and passive personality, few friends, and interest in warlords of specific eras of Japanese history. She likes matcha, but hates chocolates. Her favorite drink is green tea, her favorite animals are hedgehogs, her favorite TV program type is documentary, her best subject is social science, and her daily convention is divination. She seems to be the first one to fall in love with Futaro. Her cooking skills are abysmal, but after Futaro said that he preferred girls who can cook, she began focusing to improve that talent. While taking confidence in her pursuit of Futaro, after seeing her sisters one by one starting to pursue his affection as well, made her shyness bloom, even more, seeing her sisters as better candidates for his love and grew scared of \\"playing fair\\" against them who had a more aggressive approach. She manages to successfully confess to Futaro the second time, though she leaves it vague to make him embarrassed. After this, she regains her confidence and goes for a more assertive/aggressive approach similar to Nino's. She decides to pursue culinary arts after realizing she likes to \\"make stuff\\", regardless if it is for Futaro's sake or not. After Futaro's choice at the end of the school festival, she counsels Yotsuba into accepting the other sisters' frustration and anger and that she should pursue her own happiness. She ultimately realizes that despite not being Futaro's choice, she is happy that she has become a unique individual and takes pride in it. 5 years later she opens the Nakano Bakery shop with Nino, borrowing the place of the former Uesugi restaurant. ; : :The fourth sister, she has medium-length hair and a ribbon styled into two vertical \\"ears\\". Always cheerful, friendly and good at sports, her constantly active personality can annoy others. She likes citrus unshiu, but hates bell peppers. She likes watching anime and loves drinking carbonated fruit juice. Her favorite animals are camels, her best subject is Japanese, and her daily convention is watering plants. She has received 0% scores on school tests. Her actions usually suggest either a complete absence of thought or unconscious intricate plans far beyond anything the other characters could imagine. She is the only one to immediately accept Futaro as their tutor. She's supportive and always looking out for other people, especially her sisters and Futaro. She has a bad habit of putting others' needs above her own. :Later it's revealed that she's the girl from the photo, the one Futaro met 5 years before the start of the story during a school trip at Kyoto. She met him by coincidence, getting him out of a complicated situation and spent the rest of the day together. Connecting after enjoying their adventure during the day, both promised to improve their grades in order to apply to highly profitable jobs and make their respective families have a better lifestyle, specifically Raiha for Futaro and Rena for Yotsuba. However, due to her own low self-confidence and identity issues while growing up, as well as Rena's death soon after the Kyoto trip, she slowly started growing distant from her sisters, seeing them getting slightly better grades than her with little effort while she studied hard with unsuccessful results, frustration building on her. She then decides to focus on clubs and develop her athletic abilities, dropping studying completely as she lost her resolve, changing her mindset from self-improvement to competition for recognition above her sisters and be recognized as the superior of the sisters. That ultimately costs her getting expelled from her previous school, but her sisters refuse to leave her alone and follow her. :Therefore, her selfish mind view was shattered and developed a selfless devotion towards them and started to prioritize their own happiness and desires over her own. She refuses to tell Futaro who she is after meeting with him at the start of the story because she views herself as a failure due to not being able to fulfill the promise they made and decides to support him on his school and love life, ignoring her own feelings for him when she sees her sisters slowly falling for him and actively pursuing his love. However, her subtle yet meaningful support throughout the series ends up getting noticed by Futaro, ultimately leading to him falling in love with her and choosing her at the end of the school festival. Initially she refuses and runs away, but after hearing Futaro's confession, she becomes unable to hold her feelings down and confesses her love. After the school festival, she decides that before dating Futaro she needed to talk with her sisters about their feelings and her own, especially Nino and Miku. After coming to terms that she can pursue her own happiness, she accepts both Futaro's re-confession and proposal and they become a couple. 5 years later, she lives together with Futaro at Tokyo and celebrates her wedding ceremony. In the final chapter, it's revealed she is the one who kissed Futaro under the bell while disguised as Itsuki, event which Futaro in the future narrates as the moment he started seeing his bride as \\"special\\". ; : :The fifth and the youngest sister, she has an expressive ahoge, long hair with two twirling \\"streams\\" and two stars beside her eyes. Her blood type is A. She has a two-faced personality; she's always friendly with acquaintances and classmates but Futaro's presence immediately puts her in attack mode due to his past insults. She loves to eat food and studies seriously, even though her methods need improvement. She likes meat and curry but hates umeboshi. Her favorite animal is the kangaroo. Her favorite TV program type is wasei-eigo. Her best subject is science and her daily convention is exercising abdominal muscles and doing yoga. Ever since she was little, she was close to her mother, Rena. After her death, she decided to cope with her loss by trying to replace Rena as the mother-figure of the quintuplets, with unsuccessful results. This makes her act properly towards others and is strict with her sisters at times, taking her mother's advice seriously, whether it's about how they should act with each other or how they should be careful when picking their romantic partner. After thinking about what to do with her career path, she decides to follow her mother's footsteps and become a teacher, despite her low grades. During one point of the series, she dresses as the girl from the photo, nicknaming herself \\"Rena\\" (after her mother) and meeting with Futaro in the present in order to sever ties with him and forcing him to move on from their promise. Later (after the reveal that \\"Rena\\"/Itsuki was not the girl from the photo) it's revealed that she was asked by Yotsuba (the girl from the photo) to perform this task, as she herself isn't good with disguises and doesn't want her identity revealed to Futaro and felt their promise was holding him back from enjoying his school life like a normal student. However, later in the series, Itsuki felt she couldn't keep the secret hidden much longer as she thought of it as unfair to both Yotsuba and Futaro and decided to dress as \\"Rena\\" on her own once again to make Futaro remember who he met, only for her advances to be rejected by him, who had since figured out the girl of the photo was one of the quintuplets, though not exactly which one, and he was sick of playing along with their tricks. After Futaro makes his choice, Itsuki goes under a brief period of self-doubt, unable to congratulate him on his decision and realizes her hidden feelings for him. However, after overhearing Yotsuba and Nino's discussion, she decides to let go of those feelings by realizing that \\"a fruitless love can also be beautiful\\", deciding to treasure her memories with Futaro instead. 5 years later, she becomes a teacher. Supporting characters Uesugi family ; : :Futaro's cheerful younger sister. The only female in the family and the most family-conscious, she is effectively the head of the small household. Her cute facial expressions will often sway others' hearts.

It was released in France via Newvelle Records label. Return is the label's second release and available in vinyl only by subscription only. Background Return is his first solo piano record in some 30 years after his earlier piano-led trio album The Jack DeJohnette Piano Album‚Äîhence the name. The album contains 10 solos performed on piano, nine of them are written by DeJonette. Track \\"Ode to Satie\\" pays tribute to the short, atmospheric Gymnopedies composed by French pianist Erik Satie in the late 1800s. Track \\"Dervish Trance\\" takes its cue from the whirling dances of the Sufi dervishes. \\"Lidya\\" is dedicated to DeJohnette's wife. The black-and-white cover photo is taken from the portfolio of famous French travel photographer Bernard Plossu. The album inner sleeve reproduces a poem by Pulitzer Prize-winner American poet and educator Tracy K. Smith. To record the album, DeJohnette used a handmade Italian 9' Fazioli Pianoforti piano that produces a gorgeous sound with dynamics rarely found on piano recordings. The tracks were digitally recorded at 24 bits/88.2 kHz by Marc Urselli at Eastside Sound Recording Studios in New York City and mixed to vinyl with an analog console. The album was pressed on clear 180-gram vinyl in France. Reception Jeff Wilson of The Absolute Sound stated \\"Return is his first solo album on the ivories: it‚Äôs just him and a nine-foot Fazioli grand piano... The sound is close-up and immediate, allowing DeJohnette to play with a subtlety that would be lost with more remote miking and letting the listener feel the full weight of the lower notes of the piano. Return is a lovely album that reveals yet another side to Jack DeJohnette\\". Karl Ackermann of All About Jazz commented \\"The compositions, while translated in an unpretentious way, often sound simpler than they are. In DeJohnette's album notes, he acknowledges that he did not overthink the process of recording the album, saying that he wanted the flow to be natural; the title referring to a return to uncomplicated beauty. He has achieved just that\\". Nate Chinen of the New York Times added \\"it‚Äôs an album of careful contemplation and obvious personal stake. The piano goes even farther back than the drums for Mr. DeJohnette, whose style on ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù is austere but sonorous, with viscosity in his touch and use of pedal sustain\\". Jeff Krow of Audiophile Audition wrote \\"The crystalline acoustics feature crisp pedal sustain, and the high register notes are almost piercing in their clarity. This is contemplative music, highly percussive, rhythmic, with deeply felt emotion. Jack expresses his musical talents with vibrant colors and sonorous tone\\".

He possesses the Unique Skill Predator, which allows him to eat almost anything and obtain skills and items originally from the devoured object. He can even mimic the appearance of any item or creature he has devoured. After befriending the Storm Dragon Veldora, he was given the name Rimuru; Rimuru, in turn, gave Veldora and himself the surname Tempest. After defeating the Orc Lord, he established the Jura-Tempest Federation, a nation of monsters in Great Forest of Jura that seeks co-existence of monsters with other living races. Being a slime with never seen before abilities, his level of threat cannot be measured. Rimuru's immortality is said to be of a special kind in that he will continue to live till the end of time, eventually ascending into a Greater Demon Lord. ; : :The Great Sage is one of Rimuru's two original unique skills. She has the capability to scrutinize abilities of other beings, and once Rimiru consumes them, to also deconstruct and reconstruct abilities to higher forms. She also acts as an adviser for Rimuru and also has an attitude of her own. she is the one to whom Satoru made the requests to. ; : :One of the four original True Dragons, the Storm Dragon. He befriended and named Rimuru shortly after his reincarnation as a slime. Veldora was trapped in an \\"Infinite Prison\\" by a beautiful Hero later revealed to be Chloe in the past, when he was distracted by her looks. He was freed by Rimuru when he consumed him so that they could jointly analyze the Infinite Prison spell to break it. He is classified as a \\"Calamity-level\\" threat. ; : :Shizue, also known by her nickname , is a Japanese girl who was summoned into this world, during the Bombing of Tokyo. Her summoning was considered a failure, and she was abandoned after having a fire spirit, Ifrit, bound to her body. Soon after, she gained the title \\"Conquerer of Flames\\". Shizu is actually of elderly age, but has not outwardly aged past her prime thanks to Ifrit's possession. She figures out that Rimuru was also once from Japan and in their short time together, they become good friends. Before passing away, she requested her body be devoured by Rimuru, giving him a human form. Rimuru's allies Goblins ; : :Rigurd is the chief of the Goblin Village. He was a frail old goblin until he evolved into a big-muscled hobgoblin when named by Rimuru. He is appointed by Rimuru as the Goblin King to govern over the goblins in Tempest. Rigurd tends to be the comic relief due to his loyalty to Rimuru making him act silly at times. ; : :Rigur is the son of Rigurd. Rimuru chose Rigur's deceased brother's name for him. Rigur leads the hunting party for the village's meat supply. ; : :Gobta is a small hobgoblin who serves Rimuru as the leader of goblin riders.

He ends up being a comedy relief, but nevertheless a competent fighter. Dwarves ; : :Kaijin is a dwarven blacksmith famous for his crafts. He is originally from the Dwarven capital city of Dwargon, and was serving under the king; until he was forced to take responsibly for a failed experiment by Vesta.

While leading the six ogre survivors for revenge, he comes across Rimuru and attacks him, mistaking him for the one who instigated the massacre. Upon realizing the truth, he makes a temporary alliance with Rimuru until the Orc Lord is defeated. After defeat of the Orc Lord, he and the other ogres permanently swear their allegiance to Rimuru and are named; resulting in their evolution into Kijin, a rare type of ogre.

It is believed to date back to the late-Neolithic and early-Chalcolithic eras (4000-2500 BC). The Anta da Pedra dos Mouros, the Anta da Estria, and the Anta do Monte Abra√£o are a short distance from each other and are collectively known as the Antas de Belas. The Anta da Pedra dos Mouros was first identified in the 1850s by Carlos Ribeiro. Despite being registered and protected as a national monument in 1910, the dolmen has recently suffered significant damage. The Anta da Pedra dos Mouros was reportedly first identified in 1856 by Carlos Ribeiro (1813-1882) but he did not have a chance to carry out excavations until 1876 after receiving approval from the landowner, the Marquis of Belas. The burial chamber was at that time already in bad condition, having only three upright support stones, with one apparently having two anthropomorphic figures engraved on it. Ribeiro found three remaining orthostats in situ. The largest one was sloping to the north, 5 meters long, 3.7 m wide and 0.27 m thick. This was partially supported by a second piece, 4.5 m long, 2 m wide and 0.25 m thick, which was in contact with the third stone, which was about 4 meters wide, but rose only one meter above the ground, since it was broken. There were no visible fragments around. During the excavation, Ribeiro also found four smaller slabs. Ribeiro and subsequent studies (by Ferreira, G. and V. Leisner and Boaventura) have produced differing interpretations of both the exact structure of the sepulchre and its orientation. The Anta in 2019 Items found by Ribeiro during his excavations are kept in the Geological Museum in Lisbon. They include a stone axe, flint tools, utensils for domestic use, vases, and human and animal bones. Ribeiro noted that the contents of the tomb had already been disturbed, and that his findings were \\"not very fruitful\\". This impression was confirmed by the presence in the spoils of a Portuguese coin dated 1741 and by information from local inhabitants who advised Ribeiro that the tomb had been raided a decade before his excavations. However, contrary to the opinion of Ribeiro (1880) and later authors, the items collected, although scarce, do allow for an overall understanding of the tomb. The site had for a long time been one of pilgrimage for the local population, it being believed that newly married women who slid down the side of the dominant stone would then be able to conceive. These pilgrimages came to an end in 1942 when the landowner forbade access. The dominant stone was found shattered into numerous pieces in June 2010: it remains unclear whether this was caused by vandalism or was the result of detonations during construction of the new A9 Motorway, which passes close to the dolmen.

It originated in an article about Britain's East African colonies in the edited volume History of East Africa (1976), but has subsequently been used by historians in other contexts although primarily within African history. Concept According to Anthony Low and John Lonsdale, the \\"second colonial occupation\\" represented a distinct period in British colonial rule which began after World War II, running approximately from 1945 to 1963, which followed a first \\"occupation\\" that had lost momentum after the era of New Imperialism. This argument was first made in an article entitled \\"East Africa: Towards a New Order, 1945-1963\\", published in the third volume of the History of East Africa (1976). Low and Lonsdale wrote: According to Low and Lonsdate, the first \\"colonial occupation\\" had occurred at the time of colonial conquest in the era of New Imperialism which had based claims for colonial sovereignty on effective occupation of territory before World War I. As a result of budgetary constraints and the Great Depression, colonial administration had become increasingly reliant on simple extraction of resources and on indirect rule. This meant that the number of European administrators, employees, and officials could been kept low. The British Empire accumulated significant dollar-denominated debts to the United States during World War II. As such, it was necessary to reduce foreign-currency imports and believed that colonial agricultural produce could replace products previously acquired overseas. This would involve a restructuring of African economies \\"in the interests of the British consumer\\", a process which would require greater investment in terms of manpower and investment.J. McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859‚Äì1966 Woodbridge, James Currey p. 237. Large numbers of European experts, such as agronomists and anthropologists, were recruited to improve African agricultural processes and the state invested in large planned economic projects such as the Tanganyika groundnut scheme (1947‚Äì52). This led to unprecedented state interference in the day-to-day lives of the colonial population, especially peasants, helping to drive the emergence of popular African anti-colonial nationalism. The move towards \\"development\\" or \\"trusteeship\\" in colonial policy is often traced to the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1940 or the wartime ideals exemplified by the Atlantic Charter. It has been argued that there was a continuity between the ethos of the second colonial occupation and the post-colonial focus on economic development.

He wrote it in 1844 for the Berlin Cathedral, setting verses 11 and 12 from Psalm 91. Later, Mendelssohn made the motet with accompaniment part of his oratorio Elijah. It was published in 1844, and by Breitkopf & H√§rtel in 1875 in the complete edition of the composer's works.  History  Mendelssohn composed the motet in 1844 for the choir of the Berlin Cathedral which he conducted from 1843. He dedicated it to Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, who had survived an assassination attempt shortly before. It was published by B√∂senberg in Leipzig in 1844. Later, Mendelssohn made the motet with orchestral accompaniment part of his oratorio Elijah, as movement 7. It appeared in 1875 in the complete edition of the composer's works by Breitkopf & H√§rtel. It was published in a critical edition by B√§renreiter and by Carus- Verlag. Mendelssohn's autograph is held by the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin ‚Äì Preussischer Kulturbesitz.  Text and music  The text are verses 11 and 12 from Psalm 91 in the translation by Martin Luther. The English translation is from the King James Version of the Bible. The German \\"beh√ºten\\" is related to \\"h√ºten\\", the job of a shepherd, to guard and protect, captured in the English Guardian angel. The music is in one movement in G major and common time, marked Allegretto non troppo. Mendelssohn wrote it in three sections, ABA', with a recapitulation of text and music of the first verse after the second. The first line is sung only by the four upper voices in homophony, beginning softly (piano) in steady walking rhythm, with an accent, in high pitch and by double length, on \\"Engeln\\" (angels). It is similarly answered by the lower voices. The antiphonal treatment continues for the second line, with a climax in eight-part homophony. A repeat of the first line begins the second verse (line 3, \\"bear thee up in their hands), which appears as slightly more lively motif in upward motion, first divided again for the two choirs then reaching a climax for all voices on \\"dich\\" (you), marked forte for the first time. It leads to the last line, set for all voices with chromatism in dense texture. Text and themes from the beginning return in the upper voices, while the lower voices still end line 4 in long notes. In the recapitulation, the theme from the beginning is treated to some intensifying polyphony. The piece ends, gradually softening, in calmness.  Recording  The popular motet was recorded often. Its title was chosen as the title of a collection of sacred music by Mendelssohn, recorded in 1997 by the Kammerchor Stuttgart, conducted by Frieder Bernius. The motet was recorded in 2009 by the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, conducted by Daniel Reuss, among psalm settings by Mendelssohn and Cyrillus Kreek. The Chamber Choir of Europe recorded it to conclude a collection of Mendelssohn's choral works, conducted by Nicol Matt, in 2006. It concludes volume V of sacred a cappella works. It was performed by the Regensburger Domspatzen in a concert for Pope Benedict XVI in the Sistine Chapel in 2005, which is available on CD.

It is free software under the GNU General Public License version 3. Fractal can be installed on various Linux distributions via Flathub, which is the recommended installation method, although some distributions provide packages through their official repositories. Features Fractal integrates well into the GNOME desktop with a clean and easy-to-use user interface design that is optimized for collaboration in big groups. The functionality was still limited in early releases from spring 2018, when features such as video chat and end-to-end encryption were missing. The user interface targets both smartphones and desktop systems and adapts to different screen sizes and formats. Architecture Fractal is written in Rust and has a graphical user interface that, like any GNOME software, is based on the GTK widget toolkit. For the adaptive user interface, it uses a software library called libhandy that is developed by the computer manufacturer Purism. Logon credentials can be stored in any local password manager that provides the Secret Service API. The functionality is to be split into separate frontends for mass chat and personal instant messaging using a common backend, tentatively called Discussions and Messages, respectively. History The first code was committed to Fest (formerly known as ruma-gtk) on December 29, 2016, from which the Fractal codebase was forked by Daniel Garc√≠a Moreno in August 2017. For the first release (v0.1.0) on November 10, 2017 it was called Guillotine. With the release of version 0.1.22 on March 27, 2018 it entered beta status. With GNOME version 3.30 of September 5, 2018, it reached release status and became part of The GNOME Project, following its release cycle and versioning. Over that summer, two students worked on Fractal, which was sponsored as part of the Google Summer of Code program, including the development of localization and spell-checking support. Computer manufacturer Purism is working to integrate it into the crowd-funded GNU/Linux smartphone Librem 5, scheduled for market release in \\"Q4 2019\\". Purism is therefore sponsoring the development of some features such as support for Matrix' end-to-end encryption (E2EE) that was standardized in 2018. E2EE is implemented as a separate software module whose basic functionality was available by autumn 2018.

The country has a long coastline and the habitats include mountains, hills, tundras, forests, rivers, lakes and cultivated land. The climate is in general very mild for a country at this latitude, because of the significant maritime influence.  Geography  Sweden is an elongated country to the east of Norway and the Scandinavian Mountains and to the west of the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. It extends from a latitude of 55¬∞N to more than 70¬∞N, which is north of the Arctic Circle. The coastline is much indented with many small islands and two larger ones in the Baltic Sea, Gotland and √ñland. To the southwest lie the sea areas of the Skagerrak the Kattegat while to the northeast lies the land border with Finland. Much of Sweden is heavily forested, with 69% of the country being forest and woodland, while agricultural land constitutes only 8% of land use. Most of northern and central Sweden constitutes the Norrland terrain which consist of large areas of hilly and mountainous land covered with boreal forests. South and east of this is the Central Swedish lowland region which used to be covered by broad- leaved forests but has now largely been cleared. Some very large lakes occur in this region. The fertile soil supports agriculture but some soils in the hilly parts are thinner and in these parts, Scots pine and Norway spruce grow. To the south of this region, the land rises to the South Swedish highlands, a terrain of elongated hills and plains largely covered by broadleaf forests and the region of Sweden with the greatest biodiversity.  Climate  Despite its northerly latitude, most parts of Sweden have a temperate climate with few temperature extremes. Climatically, the country can be divided into three regions; the northernmost part has a subarctic climate, the central part a humid continental climate and the southernmost part an oceanic climate. The country is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, mainly because of the combination of the Gulf Stream and the general westerly direction of the wind. The northern half of the country gets less rainfall than Norway because of the rain shadow effect caused by the Scandinavian Mountains.  Biodiversity  There are an estimated 50,000 species of animals and plants in terrestrial habitats in Sweden; this represents 32% of the total species found in Europe. These include 73 species of mammal, ca. 240 breeding bird species (and another 60 or so non-breeding species seen yearly to rarely), 6 species of reptile, 12 species of amphibian, 56 species of freshwater fish, around 2000 species of vascular plant, close to 1000 bryophyte species and almost 2000 lichens.  Flora  Mountain birch near the treeline Peat bog in Dalarna, the Scots pine is common in the boreal forest Sk√•ne and a narrow strip along the west coast belong to the nemoral zone where beech (Fagus sylvatica) is the dominant tree species. Forest herbs in this zone commonly vegetate and flower in spring, as the crown of beech is very dense, and little light reaches the ground once the leaves appear. Examples are Anemone spp. and Corydalis spp. Oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) forest occurs on poor soils. Forest of alder (Alnus glutinosa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and elm (Ulmus glabra) grow in nutrient-rich, often wet soil, but most of these areas have long since been drained and converted to arable fields. Most of Sweden below the mountains is covered by conifer forest and forms part of the circumboreal zone. South of river Dal√§lven, there are scattered deciduous trees like oak (Quercus robur), and this zone is referred to as boreo-nemoral. North of Dal√§lven, in the proper boreal (taiga) zone, deciduous trees are rarer, but birches (Betula pubescens and Betula pendula) and aspen (Populus tremula) may be abundant in early successional stages, such as after fire or in recently clear-cut areas. There are a total of four native conifers in Sweden, and of these only Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) form forests, in pure or mixed stands. Spruce grows wetter and pine drier, but in bogs there are often numerous dwarfed pines. Undergrowth in spruce forest is commonly almost pure stands of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). In wetter types ferns (e. g. Athyrium filix-femina and Dryopteris spp.) are abundant and in richer parts herbs (e. g., Paris quadrifolia, Actaea spicata) and broad-leaved grasses (e. g. Milium effusum). In pine forest, lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and/or Cladonia lichens are most common. Fires occur at irregular intervals, and usually kill all spruce and most pines. Fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and Geranium bohemicum are among the first plants to germinate in the ashes. The forests of Sweden are intensively managed, excluding only some of the coldest areas and extremely rocky terrain. Fragments of old growth forest still remain near the mountains, but these mostly lack protection and are rapidly being lost. Native conifers are usually used, but some exotic species, particularly the North American lodgepole pine Pinus contorta, are sometimes planted. Much more rarely, Larix spp. and others have been tried. The network of forestry roads (government supported) is now very dense, their combined length four times that of the circumference of the globe. Wetter forest types, and smaller non-forested wetlands are routinely drained, usually causing drastic ecosystem-shifts, and biodiversity loss. In the mountains, the conifers are replaced by birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), which forms the tree-line in most areas. The undergrowth in these forests is quite variable. Under wet and nutrient-rich conditions, a luxuriant vegetation may develop, consisting of tall herbs such as Aconitum septentrionale, Angelica archangelica and Cicerbita alpina. Above the birch forest, starting at 300‚Äì1000 m, depending on latitude, there are usually willow-thickets, and above these alpine heath or meadows, the former dominated by dwarf shrubs of the family Ericaceae, the latter by sedges, rushes and various herbs such as Saxifraga spp., Dryas octopetala and Draba spp. Ranunculus glacialis reaches the highest altitude of all plants, often growing near the ever-shrinking glaciers. Wetlands cover large areas in Sweden. In the south, raised bogs are a common variety, of which a striking example is Store Mosse. These bogs largely consist of living and dead Sphagnum spp., with scattered dwarf shrubs and sedges such as Eriophorum vaginatum. In the wet southwest, Narthecium ossifragum and Erica tetralix occur in the bogs, while in the north and the east, the dwarf birch Betula nana and Ledum palustre, an evergreen shrub, are common. Rich fens, with many sedges and orchids, are rather rare, except on Gotland and √ñland, two large limestone islands in the Baltic, where Cladium-dominated fens are common. In the north of Sweden, there are many large mire complexes with both fen- and bog-like parts. The largest is found in Sjaunja, a nature reserve in Lapland. Sweden has as many as 90000 lakes bigger than one hectare. Most of these are either nutrient poor with clear water and few plants (e.g. Lobelia dortmanna and Iso√´tes spp.), like lake Vattern, or small ponds with brown water surrounded by floating mats of bog vegetation (e.g. sedges and Menyanthes trifoliata). Nutrient-rich lakes are found mostly in the south, and typically have dense reed stands, other emergent plants (e.g. Iris pseudacorus and Sparganium erectum), free-floating plants such as Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Stratiotes aloides, and submerged vegetation with spp. of Potamogeton, Ranunculus etc. The best known lakes in this category are undoubtedly T√•kern and Hornborgasj√∂n. The coast of Sweden is long, and conditions are quite different at the endpoints. Near the Norwegian border, conditions are typical North Atlantic, turning to subarctic near the Finnish border, where salinity is down to 0,1-0,2 %. A common seashore species there is the endemic, tussock-forming grass Deschampsia bottnica, which survives the destructive force of the up to 2 m thick sea-ice. Common submerged vascular plants in this area, the Gulf of Bothnia, are, among others Myriophyllum sibiricum, Callitriche hermaphroditica and Stuckenia pectinata. On the west coast, one may instead find Zostera marina in similar localities. The highest part of the country is part of the Scandinavian montane birch forest and grasslands ecoregion. At the highest altitude is high alpine tundra with very modest vegetation and bare rock, skree, snowfields and glaciers. At lower altitude is low alpine tundra with continuous plant cover; dwarf birch and willows up to tall and grasslands, as well as numerous lakes and bogs. At still lower altitude is the adjacent montane birch zone with small () mountain downy birch (Betula pubescens) above the conifer tree line; some stunted spruce and pine also occur here. At lower altitudes in the northern and central parts of the country, coniferous forests in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion occur. These are dominated by Scots pine (in drier locations), often with an understory of common juniper, Norway spruce and Siberian spruce and a significant admixture of downy birch and silver birch. Aspen and birch occur throughout this region, and Siberian larch is characteristic of the eastern part of the ecoregion. In the south east, there are scattered broad-leafed trees such as elm, ash and lime, but no oak. In the south of the country there is a southern coniferous forest region, demarcated by the northerly limit of the oak and the southern limit of the natural regeneration of spruce. Mixed with the spruce and pine in these forests are deciduous trees including the pioneering species such as birch, alder and aspen, and the long-lived oak, elm and lime. In the extreme south is the southern deciduous forest region, a vegetation cover shared by Denmark and central Europe. The dominant tree here is the beech, but oak can also form smaller forests. Elm at one time formed forests, but has been much reduced by Dutch elm disease. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include hornbeam, elder, hazel, fly honeysuckle, linden (lime), spindle, yew, alder buckthorn, blackthorn, aspen, European rowan, Swedish whitebeam, juniper, European holly, ivy, dogwood, goat willow, larch, bird cherry, wild cherry, maple, ash, alder along creeks, and in sandy soil birch compete with pine. According to Swedish state owned Sveaskog ca 25% of 10 to 30 years old forest in Norrbotten and V√§sterbotten was damaged in 2019 e.g. by conifer fungus.Varning f√∂r omfattande skogsd√∂d i norr Dagensnaringsliv 29.11.2019  Fauna  Reindeer Female willow ptarmigan in summer plumage According to the IUCN Red List, terrestrial mammals occurring in Sweden include the European hedgehog, the European mole, six species of shrews and eighteen of bats. The European rabbit, the European hare and the mountain hare all live here as do the Eurasian beaver, the red squirrel and the brown rat as well as about fourteen species of smaller rodent. Of the ungulates, the wild boar, the fallow deer, the red deer, the elk, the roe deer and the reindeer are found in the country. Terrestrial carnivores include the brown bear, the Eurasian wolf, the red fox and the Arctic fox, as well as the Eurasian lynx, the European badger, the Eurasian otter, the stoat, the least weasel, the European polecat, the European pine marten and the wolverine. The coast is visited by three species of seal, and around thirteen species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. Sweden's Red List of critically endangered mammals include the Bechstein's bat, the common pipistrelle and the Arctic fox, while endangered mammals include the barbastelle, the serotine bat, the pond bat, the lesser noctule and the wolf. Listed as vulnerable are the Eurasian otter, the wolverine, the harbour seal, the harbour porpoise and the Natterer's bat. According to Avibase: Bird Checklists of the World, 535 species of bird have been recorded in Sweden. Many of these are migratory birds, making their way between Arctic breeding grounds and overwintering quarters further south in Europe and Africa. The lakes, wetlands and coasts provide nesting opportunities for water birds and seabirds and the upland regions are home to willow ptarmigan, black grouse, western capercaillie, owls and birds of prey. The only endemic fish in Sweden is the critically endangered freshwater Coregonus trybomi, still surviving in a single lake. Amphibians found in Sweden include eleven species of frogs and toads and two species of newt, while reptiles include four species of snake and three of lizard. They are all protected under the law. Sweden has an estimated 108 species of butterfly, 60 species of dragonfly and 40 species of wood boring beetle.  Conservation  Forests have been conserved in Sweden for over thirty years with a view to encouraging biodiversity. This is done at various scales, from the small scale leaving of individual dead and living trees in otherwise cleared areas and the medium scale retention of forest remnants, with 5% of the forested land being retained for conservation purposes, to the large scale preservation and protection of large areas with high conservation value through the creation of nature reserves. Climate change is likely to have an effect on the country's biodiversity, with the treeline moving further north and to higher altitudes, and forests replacing tundra. The melting of ice will increase runoff, affecting wetlands. With a rise in sea level, the Baltic Sea will receive greater inflow of saline water.

She contributed to the nationwide reform of public health, philanthropy and suffrage for women during the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.  Early life and education  Born Elizabeth Avery in 1848 in Oxfordshire, England, Eggert moved to the United States in 1853 with her family, where they settled in Connecticut. Eggert studied at the Ipswich Female Seminary in Massachusetts. By the end of the 1860s she graduated from the Homeopathic Hospital College for Women, in Cleveland, Ohio. Career She moved to Lawrence, Kansas where Eggert opened her own homeopathic medicine medical practice. She became the first woman in Kansas to be admitted to any medical society in that state when she joined the Kansas Homeopathic Medical Society in 1872. The following year after joining the Medical Society, she married Frederick Eggert (May 30, 1843 ‚Äì April 26, 1918.) Frederick hailed from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1876 the two arrived in Albany, Oregon, where Frederick supported them working in dry goods. In 1882 Frederick and Elizabeth moved again, to Portland, Oregon, where the couple opened a shoe store called Eggert, Young & Company. The business grew throughout the Pacific Northwest, opening several branches. Frederick continued to manage the home store in Portland until 1918, when he died at the age of 75. Elizabeth continued as the vice president of Eggert-Young Company in Portland.  Suffragist  Elizabeth was active for about 25 years in the movement to secure voting rights for women in Oregon. She was the president of the Portland Woman's Club in 1912, during the club's last year campaigning for the vote, which was granted in Oregon in November of that year. As a member of the club's Suffrage Campaign Committee and an organizer and speaker on the movement's behalf, she likely played a key role in the success of the campaign.

He wrote an early book on athletic performance, Physical Training for High Speed Competitions, that was published in 1888. In addition to diet recommendations for the cyclist, Furnivall advised abstention from alcohol and tobacco, and streamlined clothing designed \\"not to catch the wind, and yet to leave all the joints free play\\". He also warned the cyclist never to forget \\"that you are a sportsman and a gentleman.\\" An acrostic titled \\"Lays of the Track.

Illness and death In 1919, Furnivall took early retirement due to ill- health and subsequently moved to Northam in North Devon. He was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1937 and as a result received treatment using x-rays and radium. In February 1938 he wrote to the British Medical Journal to describe his own experiences of his treatment, saying \\"I would not wish my worst enemy the prolonged hell I have been through with radium neuritis and myalgia for over six months.\\" His correspondence prompted a debate in the columns of the journal that reflected the wider debate in the medical community between those who favoured the new treatments for cancer of radium and x-rays and those that favoured the traditional treatment of surgery which they saw as having fewer injurious side-effects.

From 1967 to 1992 he was a professor for painting art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.  Personal life  In his early years, Tr√∂ger received since 1946 private painting and drawing lessons by the German painter Wilhelm Beindorf in his home village Marktleuthen. Due to these early student years, he had the privilege of a first and basic artistic education. Tr√∂ger: \\"For myself this time was a gift, it was inspiring and important.\\" In the year 1949 Tr√∂ger moved to Munich and studied until 1957 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. His professors were Hans G√∂tt and Erich Glette. Since these years he is also active as an independent artist. In 1967 he was appointed as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. He taught for 25 years until 1992. His students were, amongst others, Peter Casagrande, Wolfgang Eberlein, Cornelia Eichacker, Paul Havermann, Martin Gensbaur, Christoph Kern, Gerhard Merz, German Stegmaier, Horst Th√ºrheimer und Richard Vogl. In the year 1977 Tr√∂ger was elected a regular member of the Bayerische Akademie der Sch√∂nen K√ºnste in Munich. Relatively late he presented his own artworks to the public: in 1977 the first exhibition of his paintings and drawings out of the years from 1963 to 1976 took place. Hermann Kern, later director of the Haus der Kunst in Munich, organized the show at the Kunstraum M√ºnchen. Since the 1980s Tr√∂ger is represented by the Gallery Fred Jahn in Munich. In the 1990s and 2000s, numerous nationwide and international exhibitions followed, including in Munich, Berlin, Z√ºrich, Saint Petersburg, and New York. Since 2006, ten of the artist's large garden paintings adorn the Hubertussaal in the Nymphenburg Palace in Munich. Tr√∂ger lives and works since the 1970s in the area of Dachau, in the north-west of Munich.  Art, work and style  \\"Landscape, portrait, and still life are the subjects that Rudi Tr√∂ger is working on since the early 1960s. Classical themes that still determine his work today,\\" art historian Michael Semff sums up Tr√∂ger's oeuvre. On plus the artist is also well known for his studies of bathers. The transitions between the individual genres are fluid. Still lifes in his works are partly depicted in front of landscapes, garden paintings show an open transition to wide landscapes. His painting style is described as both representational and expressive, both realistic and abstract. In this respect, it is difficult to assign Tr√∂ger to a particular art movement. The art historian B√§rbel Sch√§fer describes Tr√∂ger as a border crosser between the worlds: His art conjures up poetry and melancholy, depicts beauty and broken illusions, expresses harmony, loneliness and the lost of man, his exposure to the world. Pictorial themes such as still lifes, landscapes and bathing figures by the French painter Paul C√©zanne influenced his artistic work, as did the works of Adolf H√∂lzel and Oskar Coester. Although Tr√∂ger perceived the Informalism that unfolded in the 1950s, he continued on his own path as an artist. Between 1965 and 1968, Tr√∂ger produced also a notable printmaking work alongside his paintings. Tr√∂ger favours the withdrawn work as an artist and intensive examination of the painting process but shuns the great stage of the art world. Thus, for him, the process of creating is fundamentally more important than the result. His creative process is characterized by repeated revisions and interruptions. Tr√∂ger is not only interested in figuration in itself, but in the metamorphosis of visual experience into a pictorial idea.

From 1954 he worked in the Vienna City and State Archives and in 1976 took over their management, which he held until his retirement in 1989. In 1977 he founded the Vienna branch of the Ludwig Boltzmann Gesellschaft for urban history research, which was integrated into the City and State archives, and which he headed until his death. From 1993 to 2003 he was president of the . In 1979 he was appointed associate professor at the University of Vienna, and in 1985 was awarded the title Hofrat by the Federal President. Even after his retirement, Czeike devoted himself to the history of Vienna. His main work is the six-volume Historische Lexikon Wien published from 1992 to 2004 with about 3,700 pages and 30,000 keywords, which is regarded as the standard work concerning the history of Vienna and is usually simply called der Czeike by experts. The Gro√üe Groner Wien Lexikon,Das grosse Groner-Wien-Lexikon published by Czeike in 1974, can be regarded as a preliminary stage. Its topographical part goes back to Richard Groner's \\"Vienna as it was\\" (later edited by Otto Erich Deutsch) and Ernestine Krug collaborated on its biographical part. Czeike was supported in the creation of the Historisches Lexikon Wien by the collaboration of his wife Helga, who is also mentioned as co-author in some of his other books. In addition, he called on the human resources of the Vienna City and Provincial Archives and employed a team of experts with whom he had accumulated specialized knowledge about Vienna. The encyclopedia was made available online in 2014 by the City of Vienna as a digitalised version and at the same time served as a database for the Vienna History Wiki. On 23 April 2006, Czeike died unexpectedly during a stay in Merano. He is buried in an honorary grave in the Hietzing Cemetery (group 14, number 23).

Single pulses at free-electron lasers are bright enough to generate resolvable Bragg diffraction from sub-micron crystals. However, these pulses also destroy the crystals, meaning that a full data set involves collecting diffraction from many crystals. This method of data collection is referred to as serial, referencing a row of crystals streaming across the X-ray beam, one at a time. Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SFX) schematic  History  While the idea of serial crystallography had been proposed earlier, it was first demonstrated with XFELs by Chapman et al. at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) in 2011. This method has since been extended to solve unknown structures, perform time-resolved experiments, and later even brought back to synchrotron X-ray sources.  Methods  In comparison to conventional crystallography, where a single (relatively large) crystal is rotated in order to collect a 3D data set, some additional methods have to be developed to measure in the serial mode. First, a method is required to efficiently stream crystals across the beam focus. The other major difference is in the data analysis pipeline. Here, each crystal is in a random, unknown orientation which must be computationally determined before the diffraction patterns from all the crystals can be merged into a set of 3D hk‚Ñì intensities.  Sample Delivery  The first sample delivery system used for this technique was the Gas Dynamic Virtual Nozzle (GDVN) which generates a liquid jet in vacuum (accelerated by a concentric helium gas stream) containing crystals. Since then, many other methods have been successfully demonstrated at both XFELs and synchrotron sources. A summary of these methods along with their key relative features is given below: * Gas Dynamic Virtual Nozzle (GDVN) \\\\- low background scattering, but high sample consumption. Only method available for high repetition rate sources. * Lipidic Cubic Phase (LCP) injector \\\\- Low sample consumption, with relatively high background. Specially suited for membrane proteins * Other viscous delivery media \\\\- Similar to LCP, low sample consumption with high background * Fixed target scanning systems (wide variety of systems have been used with different features, with standard crystal loops, or silicon chips) - Low sample consumption, background depends on system, mechanically complex * Tape drive (crystals auto-pipetted onto a Kapton tape and brought to X-ray focus) - Similar to fixed target systems, except with fewer moving parts  Data Analysis  In order to recover a 3D structure from the individual diffraction patterns, they must be oriented, scaled and merged to generate a list of hk‚Ñì intensities. These intensities can then be passed to standard crystallographic phasing and refinement programs. The first experiments only oriented the patterns and obtained accurate intensity values by averaging over a large number of crystals (> 100,000). Later versions correct for variations in individual pattern properties such as overall intensity variations and B-factor variations as well as refining the orientations to fix the \\"partialities\\" of the individual Bragg reflections.

First settling in Charleston, South Carolina, he had strong sympathies for the Southern cause. When the Civil War began, he joined the Confederacy and was commissioned lieutenant in the regular Confederate army 1861. Attached to the 51st Virginia Volunteer Infantry, he was elected its lieutenant colonel when the regiment was reorganized in the spring of 1862. Subsequently, promoted to its colonel, he commanded a brigade at the end of the war. Wounded at Winchester 1864, he became a prisoner-of-war at Waynesboro 1865. Released, he ventured to Lynchburg, Virginia, to marry the woman he had met as a convalescent. They settled and made a family in the town, and Forsberg served as its city engineer for over twenty years. Early life Born in Stockholm, Forsberg graduated from the Royal Institute of Technology, and served as a lieutenant in the Royal Swedish Engineers. In 1855, he moved to the United States, working as an engineer on a government project in Charleston, South Carolina. He later worked as an architect in Baltimore and as a draftsman at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., still under construction.Lonn 1940, p. 244.Davis 1984, p. 9.√Öberg 1994, p. 61.Allardice 2008, p. 152. Civil War Forsberg was well known for his Southern sympathies. When the Civil War began, the Danish consul informed him that the United States government would offer him a commission in the army, if he refused it, he would be arrested. Forsberg soon found place on a fishing vessel that took him to Charleston, where he was employed as a volunteer topographical engineer in the defense of the city. In August, 1861, Forsberg moved to Richmond, Virginia where he met John B. Floyd, former U.S. Secretary of War, who advised him to apply President Jefferson Davis in person for a commission in the Confederate army. Commissioned as a lieutenant, Forsberg was detailed to serve on the staff of Floyd, now a brigadier general in command of the Confederate troops in the Kanawha Valley.Lonn 1940, pp. 244-245.Davis 1984, pp. 9-10. Forsberg was commissioned first lieutenant in the Corps of Infantry of the Army of the Confederate States of America (the regular army of the Confederacy). The Provisional Congress of the Confederate States confirmed his commission, January 24, 1862, to take rank from October 11, 1861.Journal of the Congress of the Confederate States, vol. 1, p. 706. In August 1861, Forsberg had been detached from the Floyd's staff to the 51st Virginia Infantry, to aid with the training of the men. He remained with the regiment during the rest of the war. In early February 1862, the regiment, with the rest of Floyd's division, was sent to Fort Donelson, in order to strengthen its garrison. Lieutenant Forsberg was commended for his bravery during the battle of Fort Donelson. When the fort ignominiously surrendered, Floyd's command managed to escape.Davis 1984, pp. 3, 7-10.Gott 2003, pp. 246-249, 251-252. Having escaped from the prison camp, the 51st Virginia Infantry eventually returned to Virginia. Reorganized at Wytheville, several officers left the service, including the lieutenant colonel James W. Massie. In accordance with the Confederate Conscription Act,O'Hallahan 2017, p. 103. elections of new officers were held in the beginning of May. Forsberg was elected in his stead, and officially commissioned May 26, 1862. When in August 1862, Colonel Gabriel C. Wharton became brigade commander, Lieutenant Colonel Forsberg was put in his placer as commanding officer, and would henceforth lead the regiment. In July 1863, Colonel Wharton was promoted to brigadier general, and Forsberg was subsequently promoted to full colonel, July 8, 1863. In hospital at Lynchburg, Virginia during the battle of New Market, Forsberg could not command his regiment during that critical battle. During the battle of Lynchburg, Forsberg commanded Wharton's brigade, as the general had been put in command of Breckinridge's division. Leading the brigade at the third battle of Winchester, Forsberg was shot in his right hand while trying to rally his men. He did not return to active service until February 1865, when he resumed the brigade command. At the battle of Waynesboro, Forsberg, as well as most of his command, become prisoners of war.Blackford 1901, pp. 24, 48.Davis 1984, pp. 11, 14, 18, 23, 26-27, 32-34, 66. Postbellum Forsberg remained a prisoner of war at Fort Delaware until released in June 1865. He then returned to Lynchburg, where he had been a convalescent after his wounding at Winchester. During his stay at the Ladies Relief Hospital in the city, he had met Mary Elizabeth Otey, the widow of a young officer, George Gaston Otey, who had been killed in action early in the war. She was daughter- in-law of Lucy Mina Otey, the founder of the hospital, and worked as a nurse there. Soon after his return, Forsberg married Mary Elizabeth, and the family settled in the city. Forsberg served as city engineer for 21 years, and designed many of the city's public buildings, some of which were in the Fifth Street Historic District.Evans 1899, vol. 3, pp. 1161-1162.Frank 2008, vol. 1, p. 339.Davis 1984, p. 44.Harvey 2009.\\"Fifth Street Historic District (VDHR# 118-5318).\\" National Park Service.

Vani's death leads to Agashe's alcohol and drug addiction, and his change in personality. Sara tells Advait of her decision not to abort the baby and that she no longer wants a nomad life. Advait, having a fear of commitment, leaves Sara and goes off towards the northern mountains to meet a friend. In the present day, Advait murders two more cops, Nitin and Deven (Prasad Jawde) and to the coincidence both were close friends of Michael and later Michael becomes suspicious of Jessie, a drug-addicted prostitute who is Advait's friend and has been helping him with the murders. Michael notices her in the room and followed her till her presiding place and on knowing this Jessie tries to burn down the evidence at her place but Michael enters and sees that he is also one of the targets on Advait's hit list. In a turn of events after killing 3 officers, Advait surrenders himself to Agashe. Michael's past, and what really happened to Sara and Advait is revealed: Michael grew up in an abusive family. As an adult, he is about to marry his girlfriend Teresa, but due to the abuse, he is uncomfortable with sex and intimacy and rejects Teresa when she touches him before marriage giving the excuse that he doesn't want such relations before marriage. However, fearing that his lack of sexual experience will make him \\"less than a man\\", Michael goes to Jessie to lose his virginity. Sara has been living with Jessie after Advait left her. Michael enters while Jessie was away to the market and thinks that Sara is the prostitute. In the meantime, Advait returns to Goa, having realized his mistake. He arrives at Jessie's house, only to find Michael trying to rape Sara. He intervenes and calls the police. Michael's cop friends, Nitin, Deven, and Victor, arrive. In the police van, Advait and Sara reconcile. Instead of the station, Michael and his posse drag Advait and Sara onto a bridge, planning to frame them for drug peddling to avoid the scandal of Michael, a cop, visiting a prostitute. Michael injects a lethal drug into the couple before throwing Sara off the bridge while Advait is sentenced to five years in jail. Advait has been taking revenge for Sara's death. In the present day, Michael reveals to Advait at the station that he raped and killed Jessie after the house burnt. He then leaves so that Agashe can do his \\"encounter\\". However, before leaving, Michael says \\"Happy Solstice\\" to Agashe that makes Agashe realize that he is the reason behind Advait's vengeance as Advait had been calling Agashe before each murder and saying the same thing. Agashe takes Advait to the same bridge where it all started, where Advait tells him that Michael and his friends killed Sara. At the same time, Michael goes home and sees that Teresa is about to leave him. Michael suffers a psychotic break and attempts to murder his wife. As he is choking her, he is suddenly injected in the neck with a drug. When he turns around, he sees Sara, alive and well wearing the same jacket as Advait was wearing. It is shown in a flashback that Jessie had saved Sara from the fall but Sara lost her baby. Over the course of five years, Sara and Advait had been planning revenge together and it is also shown that the murders were committed by both Sara and Advait together. Suddenly a call comes to the assistant of Agashe and it is informed that Michael has been murdered in his own home. Advait laughs as a shocked Agashe wonder who killed Michael if Advait is right in front of him. He reluctantly releases Advait as there is no evidence and Teresa tells the police she saw a man, thus protecting Sara. Advait and Sara find peace and start a new life. The film ends with Agashe getting a phone call from an unknown female caller, informing him about an upcoming murder just like he was informed by Advait, thus paving way for a sequel.

Utilizing scripting objects or the built- in command-line tool, WinRM can be used with any remote computers that may have baseboard management controllers (BMCs) to acquire data. Windows-based computers including WinRM certain data supplied by Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) can also be obtained.  Components  * WinRM Scripting API ** Provides an Application programming interface enabling scripts to remotely acquire data from computers that perform WS-Management operations. * winrm.cmd ** Built-in systems management command line tool allowing a machine operator to configure WinRM. Implementation consists of a Visual Basic Scripting (VBS) Edition file (Winrm.vbs) which is written using the aforementioned WinRM scripting API. * winrs.exe ** Another command line tool allowing the remote execution of most Cmd.exe commands. This tool utilizes the WS-Management protocol. * Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) driver ** Provides hardware management and facilitates control of remote server hardware through BMCs. IPMI is most useful when the operating system is not running or deployed as it allows for continued remote operations of the bare metal hardware/software. * WMI plug-in ** Allows WMI data to be made available to WinRM clients. * WMI service ** Leverages the WMI plug-in to provide requested data or control and can also be used to acquire data from most WMI classes.

WS-Management provides a common way for systems to access and exchange management information across the IT infrastructure.  Common uses  PowerShell 6.0 Ansible communicates with Windows servers over WinRM using the python pywinrm package and can remotely run PowerShell scripts and commands. Thycotic's Secret Server also leverages WinRM to enable PowerShell remoting. SolarWinds Server and Application Monitoring software (SAM) utilizes a WinRM server on monitored servers for its PowerShell integration. CloudBolt leverages WinRM as part of Blueprints, Server Actions, and CB Plugins to execute remote scripts on Windows servers using the python pywinrm module.  Security  WinRM uses Kerberos for initial authentication by default. This ensures that actual credentials are never sent in client-server communications, instead relying on features such as hashing and tickets to connect. Although WinRM listeners can be configured to encrypt all communications using HTTPS, with the use of Kerberos, even if unencrypted HTTP is used, all communication is still encrypted using a symmetric 256-bit key after the authentication phase completes. Using HTTPS with WinRM allows for additional security by ensuring server identity via SSL/TLS certificates thereby preventing an attacker from impersonating it.

It is a possible satellite galaxy of the dwarf lenticular galaxy NGC 404, \\"Mirach's Ghost\\", which is situated 60 arcminutes away. It is otherwise one of the most isolated dwarf spheroidal galaxies known, being separated from NGC 404 by around 211,000 light-years. The galaxy is named after its discoverer, amateur astrophotographer Giuseppe Donatiello, who sighted the galaxy in a 2016 review of his archival long exposures from 2010 and 2013. Follow-up observations with the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory led to a scientific paper on its discovery being published in December 2018.  Nomenclature  Donatiello I is named after its discoverer, Italian amateur astrophotographer Giuseppe Donatiello, and is abbreviated to \\"Do I\\". The galaxy's nickname, \\"Mirach's Goblin\\", is a reference to the nearby dwarf lenticular galaxy NGC 404, with which it may be physically associated. NGC 404 is nicknamed \\"Mirach's Ghost\\" due to its proximity to the second magnitude star Mirach.  Characteristics  Donatiello I is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy at an estimated distance from Earth between 2.5 and 3.5 megaparsecs, or 8.1 and 11.4 million light-years, outside the Local Group. Its luminosity is around 200,000 times greater than that of the Sun, with an absolute magnitude of around ‚àí8.3 and a surface brightness of 26 magnitudes per negative square arcsecond. Its effective radius is roughly estimated to be 400 parsecs, while its ellipticity is around 0.7. Donatiello I is one of the most isolated dwarf spheroidals known, and is a possible satellite galaxy of its nearest neighbor, NGC 404, which is located around 65 kiloparsecs away from it, or 211,000 light-years. Donatiello I could have either been involved in, or affected by, a possible merger between NGC 404 and an irregular dwarf galaxy around 900 million years ago. Like similar dwarf spheroidal galaxies orbiting the Milky Way Galaxy and Andromeda Galaxy, Donatiello I is populated with metal-poor red dwarfs, with no active star formation occurring.  Observation  Donatiello I lies in the constellation Andromeda, at a right ascension of and declination of , in the J2000 epoch. In the galactic coordinate system, it is located at a longitude of 127.65¬∞ and a latitude of ‚àí28.08¬∞. It is situated 60 arcminutes away from Mirach, and 72.4 arcminutes away from NGC 404. Its apparent diameter is roughly 60 arcseconds, while its surface brightness is around 27 magnitudes per square arcsecond. Amateur astrophotographer Giuseppe Donatiello first sighted the galaxy in 2016 while surveying an archived 6000-second exposure of an area around the Andromeda Galaxy taken on 5‚Äì7 November 2010 and 5 October 2013 in the Pollino National Park, with a custom-built 12.7 centimeter telescope. Donatiello intended to capture stellar streams and dwarf galaxies around Andromeda that had been reported at the time. The discovery was corroborated using images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's ninth data release, which showed a faint object in the same area, and was announced by Donatiello on 23 September 2016, via a post on Facebook. Donatiello collaborated with a team led by David Mart√≠nez-Delgado of Heidelberg University, after Delgado had come across Donatiello's post, to make further observations of the galaxy with the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory's Galileo National Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Spain, on 27 November 2016. The team's scientific paper on the discovery and their follow-up observations was submitted to the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics in April 2018, and was accepted and published in December 2018, with a preprint released on arXiv in October. Further detailed observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have been suggested by the paper's authors as a way to better determine the galaxy's distance from Earth and its relationship with NGC 404, along with Donatiello I's size and mass.

Jameson Farm is a farmstead located at 10220 North Parma Road near Springport, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History James M. Jameson moved from New York State to Springport in 1835. Soon thereafter, he settled on the land on which this house stands and constructed a log house. He began farming, and teaching school in the winter. In 1841, he married Loretta Townley, and began concentrating more on farming. Over the next decade, Jameson built one of the two largest farms in the area, and became a leading local citizen, being elected township supervisor several times. In 1850, Jameson constructed a new brick house. It was the first brick residence built in the township, and the unusually elaborate (for Michigan) house is one of the finest Greek Revival houses in south-central Michigan. Jameson left the Springport area in 1876, and died in Jackson, Michigan, in 1886. Description The Jameson Farm includes the 1850 farmhouse along with an old barnyard area containing a barn- corncrib structure, sheep pen, implement shed, and the remains of an orchard. The 1850 farmhouse is an unusually large, elaborate, brick Greek Revival structure built in an L shape. It sits on a fieldstone foundation. The house consists of a two-story main section with a hip roof and a 1-1/2-story, flank- gable, side wing. A large ell extends to the rear. The house has wide cornices with returns and a frieze band below. A porch with Doric columns fronts the wing; a second small porch was formerly located in front of the entry door. The windows are double-hung, six-pane sash units, with iron lintels and sills on the front facade and sandstone lintels and sills on the other facades.

Stone is the current United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) chair in Cultural Property Protection and Peace at Newcastle University. He was the Vice-President of Blue Shield International from 2017 - 2020, and was elected President at the 2020 General Assembly. He is also a founding member and the chair of the UK Committee of that organisation. For his long career and merits in the field of heritage education, in 2011 Stone was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Civil).  Education and Early Career  Peter G. Stone was born in 1957, in Manchester, England. He gained a bachelor's degree in History from the University of Stirling, followed by a Diploma of Education in 1979. He initially worked as a teacher, teaching history in England and English in Greece.  Career  During the summer school holidays of 1978, 1979 and 1980, Stone joined as a volunteer archaeological excavations in the Anglo- Scandinavian site of Coppergate in York, and in the Saxon site of Hamwic in Southampton. In 1980, he worked as a paid archaeologist at Hambledon Hill in Dorset and later in 1982 in Jewbury.P. G. Stone, ‚Äò4 Tier Approach in the Protection of Cultural Property‚Äô, The British Army Review, 2013-14, pp. 40-51. After completing his master's degree (MA) in archaeological method and theory at the University of Southampton in 1983, he started carrying out his PhD research on a part-time basis. His thesis, supervised by Professor Peter Ucko, titled Teaching the Past, with Special Reference to Prehistory, in English Primary Education. Whilst researching, Peter worked as a Project Manager and Coordinator at the University of Southampton for the Archaeology and Education Project set up with Ucko and then in various posts at English Heritage. The latter posts included his direct involvement with the controversies surrounding the Summer Solstice at Stonehenge in the 1990s. He became an expert on the World Heritage site of Stonehenge, Avebury, and Associated Sites and went on to publish widely on it In 1997, the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) appointed him as their Special Advisor on Stonehenge. From 1997‚Äì2003, he was also appointed the Chair of the CBA Education committee, and from the mid-80s, he was a member of their Schools Committee and Education Board. They later also appointed him CBA representative for the World Heritage site of Hadrian's Wall. Other appointments have included chairing the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site Management Plan Committee and sitting on the National Trust‚Äôs Archaeology Advisory Panel. He was the Executive Series Editor for the One World Archaeology (OWA) Series (1999‚Äì2003). As part of the OWA Series, he produced several publications on education and interpretation of archaeological and cultural heritage. In 1997, Peter joined Newcastle University as a lecturer in Heritage studies at the Department of Archaeology, and was promoted to Professor in 2005. He became Director of the International Centre for Cultural and Heritage Studies (ICCHS) in the School of Arts and Cultures in 2001-2005, and was Head of the School from 2006 until December 2015. In 2016, Peter was appointed the UNESCO Chair in Cultural Property Protection and Peace, the first of its kind.  Stone and the World Archaeological Congress  Together with Peter Ucko, Stone was instrumental in founding the World Archaeological Congress, established in 1986. The World Archaeological Congress (WAC) \\"is a not-for-profit organization and forum for discussion for anyone who is concerned with the study of the past. WAC seeks to promote interest in the past in all countries, to encourage the development of regionally-based histories and to foster international academic interaction. Its aims are based on the need to make archaeological studies relevant to the wider community\\". He was part of the steering committee, a member of the voluntary WAC Secretariat, and from 1998,the WACs Chief Executive Officer until 2008. (The Executive is the main governing body of WAC between meetings of Council). He assisted in the organisation of the WAC congress every four years from WAC 1 to WAC 6.  Cultural Property Protection: Iraq and beyond  During the Iraq War in 2003, Stone was contacted by a friend serving in the Royal Navy, working at the time in the UK Ministry of Defence. He asked Stone to provide information on the major archaeological sites that might be threatened if the discussed invasion of Iraq went ahead. Stone pointed out that he was not a Middle Eastern archaeologist, and approached two other specialists. One, the most recent Director of the British school of Archaeology in Iraq, provided a list of 36 Iraqi sites, covering a range of time periods, and both stressed the likelihood of looting during the conflict. Stone sent the information and the warning to the MoD, highlighting the UKs legal obligations around cultural property protection, and continued to lobby (ultimately unsuccessfully) to brief the Ministry of Defence. Iraq's cultural heritage was heavily damaged and looted in the years following the invasion: the most famous event was the looting of the National Museum of Iraq, but many other museums and sites were heavily affected. From this experience, he wrote extensively on the topic of cultural property protection in the event of armed conflict and the necessity of working with military forces to develop effective safeguarding measures. This led to the publication of The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq, co-edited with Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly. In addition to receiving the James R Wiseman Award of the Archaeological Institute of America, the book was highlighted as ‚ÄòBook of the Week‚Äô in the Times Higher Education, where it was described as: ‚Äòan extraordinary achievement that will stand as the definitive account of the desperate, avoidable cultural tragedy of Iraq for many years to come‚Äô. Stone also collaborated on the travelling exhibition Catastrophe! The Looting and Destruction of Iraq's Past, based on the book of the same name. The Exhibition was shown at eight UK and European venues including Newcastle upon Tyne, Durham, London, Dublin, and The Hague. Both the invasion, and the involvement of archaeologists and heritage professionals, were highly controversial: Stone in particular was heavily criticised for his involvement with the military during the Iraq invasion. As a result of this, Stone has supported extensive research on the ethics of heritage professionals working in armed conflict, and is part of the Core Research Group for the AHRC funded Heritage in War project, which looks at cultural heritage and the ethics of war. Stone coordinated the evidence of 13 heritage and cultural organisation, to The Iraq Inquiry (also referred to as the Chilcot Inquiry after its chairman, Sir John Chilcot), a British public inquiry into the nation's role in the Iraq War. The inquiry was announced in 2009 by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and published in 2016 with a public statement by Chilcot. The combined heritage submission addressed the problems faced by UK forces with respect to safeguarding the cultural heritage in Iraq. The contribution featured in part 6.2 of the final report \\"6.2 - Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003\\", in the section Sites of religious and cultural significance. Following his experiences with the cultural heritage of Iraq, Stone went on to bring the issue of cultural protection to the attention of policy makers, the general public, and numerous armed forces. He has spoken at numerous conferences, heritage, general public and military. Stone's 2013 article, A Four-Tier Approach to the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, published in Antiquity and the British Army Review, led to the establishment of a Joint Service Cultural Property Protection Unit within UK forces., hopefully operational in 2020/2021. The Unit is led by Lt Col Tim Purbrick OBE FSA VR, who was instrumental in setting up the unit in the British Army. Stone also assisted in the drafting of the CIMIC Centre of Excellence publication Cultural Property Protection Makes Sense. Commenting on Stone's work in this area, a senior CIMIC-COE staff member stated that: ‚Äòwere it not for the past work, expertise and dedication of Prof. Stone, the project would have never moved farther along than the concept‚Ä¶.His impact on both sides of the civil-military equation, in the area of joint education and training, has been significant‚Äô. Stone's work and lobbying were also highly influential in the UK's ratification of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 2017.  The Blue Shield  The International Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in 1996 to respond to threats to heritage from conflict and disaster. The organisation was formed from a representative of International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), International Council of Museums (ICOM), the International Council on Archives (ICA), and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). The organisation was hampered by lack of funding, and various countries formed national committees: in 2008, these formed the Association of National Committees of the Blue Shield. Stone became the Secretary of the ANCBS Board in March 2013.Unpublished minutes held by The Blue Shield secretariat He held that position until 2017, when ICBS and ANCBS formally merged into The Blue Shield. Stone was instrumental in drafting the new statutes of the Blue Shield, and was present when they were formally signed. Stone's Four-Tier Approach was formally adopted as official policy by the ANCBS Board in 2014, and remains official policy of The Blue Shield. At the Blue Shield 2017 General Assembly, Stone was appointed the Vice-President of Blue Shield International, the international co-ordination board of The Blue Shield, and at the General Assembly in August 2020, he was elected President. In 2012, Stone founded the UK Committee of the Blue Shield: of which he is the Chair.
