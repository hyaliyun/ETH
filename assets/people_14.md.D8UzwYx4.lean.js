Life  Pollock was born in Bangor, County Down on 16 November 1852, third and youngest son of 'Hugh' James Pollock, master mariner, and his wife, Eliza MacDowell. Educated at Bangor Endowed school, he served a shipbroking apprenticeship, then moved to McIlroy, Pollock, flour importers, which became the central vehicle of his business career, and which, under the name Shaw, Pollock & Co., grew into the largest such enterprise in Ireland. His business interests included directorships in manufacturing, shipping, and linen companies, and it was his acumen in this field that brought him to public prominence during the latter part of the First World War. He served as a Belfast Harbour Commissioner from 1899 until 1937, becoming president of the commission from 1918-21. In 1917, Pollock was appointed director of wheat supplies under the food controller for the north of Ireland, having been elected President of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce in 1917/18. Due to such accolades he was nominated ex officio to the Irish Convention (1917–18). His mastery of Anglo-Irish financial complexities quickly earned him respect and nomination to the convention's inner committee of nine. In 1918 he was appointed chairman of the Ulster selective committee, of the Ministry of Labour, a post he held until 1921, when in the general election he was elected in Belfast SouthNorthern Ireland Parliamentary Elections Results: Biographies and was immediately appointed as Northern Ireland's first Minister of FinanceThe Government of Northern Ireland and deputy premier to James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon. The constituency was abolished in 1929; thus, Pollock moved to represent Belfast Windsor, and served until his death in 1937. The optimistic economic assumptions of the immediate post-war period had already been confounded by the time Pollock took office. His input to the Northern Ireland special arbitration committee (1923–5)Northern Ireland Special Arbitration Committee (1923-5) established to review the province's funding and chaired by Lord Colwyn, ensured that Northern Ireland would be able to keep parity of social benefits with the rest of the United Kingdom, but he was unable, in the depressed conditions of the inter-war years and under the newly agreed formula, to bring Northern Ireland's underdeveloped services, in education, health, housing, and general infrastructure, up to the national level. Still, his judicious use of the loans guarantee acts, well into the 1930s, did keep up a measure of activity in a shipbuilding industry that might otherwise have perished. In 1932 he attended the Imperial Economic Conference at Ottawa\\"Imperial Economic Conference\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica. as an advisory member of the British delegation headed by Stanley Baldwin. He was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1936 in respect of the vast impact he made on the Northern Irish political and economic landscape. One of the province's leading educationists, Pollock had given evidence to the viceregal committee of inquiry into primary education (Ireland) in 1918 and in 1922 he chaired a committee to provide for teacher training in the north. For many years he served as chairman of the board of Victoria College, Belfast, one of the United Kingdom's pioneering institutions of female education. Widely travelled and read, he enjoyed golf and shooting and belonged to the Ulster Reform Club and to the Overseas League, in which he played a prominent part.  Irish Convention 1917-1918  Pollock was an Ulster delegate to the 1917-18 Irish Convention, taking part in the Grand Committee whose aims were to help resolve the important political decision of the \\"Irish Question\\" and other constitutional problems relating to an early enactment of self- government for Ireland, to debate its wider future, discuss and come to an understanding on recommendations as to the best manner and means this goal could be achieved. It was a response to the dramatically altered Irish political climate after the 1916 rebellion and proposed by David Lloyd George, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in May 1917 to John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, announcing that 'Ireland should try her hand at hammering out an instrument of government for her own people'.O'Day, Alan: Irish Home Rule 1862–1921, Attempts to implement Home Rule, 1914–18, Manchester University Press (1998) O’Day, Alan: p. 280  Legacy  Pollock had five children: four sons and a daughter. Pollock's daughter, Adelaide Franklin Pollock, achieved notoriety as an adventurer and women pioneer in aviation in the 1920s and 30s. She was an avid mountain climber, expert driver and skilled motor mechanic. Adelaide was one of the few women to be granted a pilot’s licence in the UK in the inter war era. She flew from London to India and back in 1929McKay, Stuart: \\"The de Havilland DH.60 Moth\\", Amberley Publishing; Reprint edition (15 Oct. 2016), and in the following year, boarded a steamer from London to New York, with her 'Moth' on board, with the intention of becoming the first British woman to fly across the United States. After many thrills and spills, she eventually achieved this goal, being welcomed in Hollywood, California as somewhat of a major celebrity. She subsequently visited China, Japan and Egypt in her travels across the globe. In recognition of his vast achievements, Pollock dock in Belfast Harbour is named after him.

Summit marked \\"Radio Tower\\" and \\"334\\" to W is Telescope Hill. From 1965-1980, Bald Hill was the site of a Town-owned skiing area known as the Bald Hill Ski Bowl.New England Lost Ski Areas Project, Bald Hill The seeds for this project were planted in 1964, when Suffolk County builder Henry Taca approached the Town with plans to build houses on his in the area, including the hilly Bald Hill tract. He turned over of the Bald Hill property to the Town free of charge in 1965, and in return, he received Town approval for a \\"cluster housing\\" project known as Hawthorne Estates. Under the approval, he was allowed to build more houses on his remaining acreage than would otherwise be permitted. The Bald Hill Ski Bowl officially opened on January 21, 1965, with a tow rope in operation on a wide main slope, which featured an run and vertical drop. At its opening, it was hoped that with the use of snow machines, the slopes and trails would be usable for an average of 70 days each winter. Initial prices were $3 for an all-day ticket, $2 for a half-day ticket after 1 P.M., and 25 cents for a single ski-tow trip. By January 1967, an T-bar lift had been installed to supplement three tow ropes ranging from 150 to in length, and there were five ski trails on three slopes. A Swiss-chalet style lodge with a fireplace was also added. In 1975, The New York Times reported that the ski area was drawing 5,000 visitors each week. The facility was described as covering and featuring a run for advanced skiers, a slope for \\"novices\\", and a \\"bunny run\\" for beginners. The cost for an all-day ticket was $2.25. All was not rosy, however. New \\"quiet\\" snow machines were in the process of being installed to quell complaints about noise from neighboring residents, and some members of the Town Board were complaining that the facility was costing too much and should perhaps be closed. Operating costs were reported to be $500,000 annually, with revenue of between $100,000 to $200,000, depending on the amount of snowfall. Fortunes turned briefly for the better in the winter of 1976-1977, when generous snowfall (over in Suffolk County) gave the Ski Bowl its first profitable year. But the warmer winter of 1979-80 proved to be a death blow. As of late January 1980, the ski bowl had only been open eight days for the season. Only 6,500 skiers showed up that winter, only of snow fell, and revenues fell to $18,000. As the next winter approached, the Town searched for a private operator willing to take over the facility, an unlikely prospect in light of Long Island's weather and the site's historical unprofitability. With the facility's budget slashed by over 70%, and a vague plan to open only if natural snowfall was sufficient, Bald Hill's days as Long Island's largest public skiing facility were at an end. The ski bowl site is now home of the Brookhaven Amphitheater. The ski lodge building remains as an art gallery, and sits to the right of the audience as they face the stage.

The Crosby commercial recording was made on July 17, 1936 with Jimmy Dorsey & his Orchestra for Decca Records. It was a huge hit in 1936 reaching the No. 2 spot in the charts of the day, and it greatly furthered Mercer's career. Crosby recorded the song again in 1954 for his album Bing: A Musical Autobiography. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time. Background Mercer and his wife were driving across the USA en route to Savannah after having apparently failed to succeed in Hollywood. Mercer was amused by the sight of cowboys, with spurs and ten- gallon hats, driving cars and trucks instead of riding horses. Singing cowboys were popular in films and on the radio then, and within 15 minutes, writing on the back of an envelope, Mercer transferred the image he was seeing into a song whose satirical lyrics vented some of his own bitter frustration with Hollywood. The lyrics, about a 20th-century cowboy who has little in common with cowpunchers of old, have been included in some anthologies of light verse. Other recordings The song has also been sung by Roy Rogers (Sons of the Pioneers), Sophia Johnson, Carson Robison, Bobby Darin, Tex Ritter, The Mills Brothers, Johnnie Ray, Jack Teagarden, Patsy Montana, Frank Sinatra, Steve Lawrence, Dan Hicks, and Harry Connick Jr., among others.

During the 1960s and 1970s it played a significant role in Arab–Israeli wars, at different times serving both Egypt and Israel. Construction Bir Gifgafa was constructed by the Egyptian Air Force in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis of 1956. Assigned base number 244, it was responsible for providing air cover and close support for Egyptian Army units in the Sinai. The Six Day War May 22, 1967, Nasser visits Egyptian Air Force pilots at Bir Gifgafa on the eve of the Six Day War. Destroyed MiG-21 at Bir Gifgafa, June 1967. On May 22, 1967, as Israel and its Arab neighbours were drawing closer to war, president Gamel Abdel Nasser of Egypt visited Bir Gifgafa, meeting with Egyptian Air Force (EAF) pilots and commanders. In a much publicized press conference Nasser announced his intention to close the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping and declared that We are now on the verge of a confrontation with Israel, adding that If the Jews threaten us war? I say to them \\"Welcome, we are ready for war!\\"Moshe Gat, 2005, Nasser and the Six Day War, 5 June 1967: A Premeditated Strategy or An Inexorable Drift to War?, Israel Affairs 14:4, pp. 609 - 636. As the most important Egyptian air base in the Sinai, housing units that could pose a major threat to Israeli aerial supremacy, Bir Gifgafa figured prominently in the Israeli Air Force's planning for a pre-emptive strike. On the eve of the war the air base contained elements of the EAF's 15th fighter regiment, including part of the 45th fighter squadron flying MiG-21F-13s or MiG-21PFs. A number of transports and Mil Mi-6 helicopters were stationed there as well.Nordeen, pp. 199–200 No less than six IAF formations were therefore assigned to attack the base: four Dassault Ouragan formations from 113 Squadron at Hatzor and two 109 Squadron Dassault Mystere formations from Ramat David. When Israel finally launched Operation Focus on June 5, Bir Gifgafa was the target of the very first formation to take off from Hatzor at 07:14.גל התקיפה הראשון: 204 מטוסי אויב מושמדים בבסיסיהם The four Ouragans, led by Captain Ran Alon, struck the field at 07:45, hitting the runway and destroying several aircraft, including one MiG-21 which had just taken off. The MiG was downed by Captain David Yariv, who was himself subsequently hit by anti-aircraft fire and killed. The fierce anti-aircraft fire took its toll on the other aircraft as well, with a second Ouragan forced to perform a belly landing upon returning to Ramat David, while Captain Mordechai Lavon became a prisoner of war after ejecting his stricken aircraft over the Mediterranean and swimming ashore at Gaza. By 09:05, when the first wave of operation Focus was concluded, Bir Gifgafa had been hit by three more 113 Squadron formations and by four 109 Squadron Dassault Mysteres. Another 109 Squadron formation arrived at Bir Gifgafa at 09:55, while four 105 Squadron Super Mysteres attacked the field in the afternoon, although by then Bir Gifgafa had been completely disabled and there was little damage to be done.Shalom 2002, p. 594 The Egyptian air force had lost as many as 20 MiG-21s, at least four Mi-6s and a MiG-15UTI.Nordeen, pp. 208 - 209 Although defended by the 4th Armored Division of the Egyptian army, plus a motorized infantry brigade, these forces were withdrawn as the Egyptian effort in the Sinai collapsed, and the airfield was taken by the IDF's 84th Tal Division on June 7. Once secure, IAF Nords and Dakotas begun flying in supplies for the Israeli army, as well as an MIM-23 Hawk battery to provide air defence. Several dozen AA-2 Atoll missiles and nine missile launchers were captured in Bir Gifgafa. Testing proved their compatibility with the Mirage III, and these were pressed into service with 119 Squadron in December 1967, after several successful test firings the previous month. Rephidim Airbase Israeli gains in the Six Day War meant that a great distance now lay between the air force's air bases and the front lines in the Sinai, along the Suez Canal. Israel therefore decided to employ Bir Gifgafa as a forward operating base. Following Egyptian Air Force incursions into the Sinai, four 101 Squadron Mirages first deployed there on July 26, 1967. Bir Gifgafa officially resumed operations in May 1968 as Israeli Air Force Base (Baha) 3. It was named Rephidim, after the station mentioned in the Biblical account of the Exodus from Egypt. Despite having the most rudimentary installations at first, the field and its surrounding environs soon became the hub of all IDF operations in the western Sinai, housing various air force, army and logistical units.Shalom 2007, pp. 60 - 61 It was also the IAF's transportation hub for the Sinai and was often frequented by the IAF's heavy transport aircraft, such as the C-97 Stratocruiser and Boeing 707, as well as lesser types. The War of Attrition As fighting intensified along the Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force now dispatched its fighter squadrons on regular deployments to the airfield, with four pilots and aircraft rotating every two or three weeks. Two aircraft regularly stood on quick reaction alert (QRA) at the base, ready to scramble within 5 minutes. Many of the kills achieved by Israeli fighter pilots between 1967 and 1973 were claimed by the Rephidim QRA aircraft, and many pilots sought to be stationed there during times of tension, eager to improve their chances of achieving a victory.Aloni Mirage, p. 45 The base was also the forward recovery base for any aircraft damaged or low on fuel, as well as the premier medical station for soldiers wounded in the fighting along the Canal, from which they were then ferried to Israel.Shalom 2007, p. 62 Rephidim was permanently at the forefront of fighting between Israel and Egypt during War of Attrition, taking part in every major incident along the Suez Canal, as well as numerous minor ones. On August 26, 1967, a pair of Egyptian Su-7s struck at the field, damaging the main runway. One was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, while the second evaded the two 119 Squadron Mirages scrambled to intercept it.Shalom 2007, pp. 126–128Air Defense Corps on the Israeli Air Force website The first kill by a Rephidim-based aircraft came on October 10, 1967, when Avihu Bin-Nun, leading a pair of 119 Squadron Mirages, shot down an Egyptian MiG-21 over the Sinai. It was the QRA aircraft at Rephidim which provided cover for the rescue efforts following the sinking of INS Eilat,Shalom 2007, p. 138 and Mirages from Rephidim also took part in Rimon 20, the July 1970 air battle which saw 5 Soviet-flown MiG-21s shot down.Norton, p. 206 The Yom Kippur War During the Yom Kippur War of 1973, Rephidim was once again at the forefront of fighting between Israel and Egypt. Although a heightened state of alert had been declared throughout the IAF on October 5, Rephidim was ill-prepared for the Egyptian attack which launched the war. 16 Su-7s, escorted by 6 MiG-21s, struck the field at 14:00 on October 6, escaping unharmed. Although the main runway was disabled for four hours, the parallel taxiway was operational within 30 minutes of the attack, allowing Rephidim to join the fighting now raging along the Suez Canal.Gordon, p. 275 Two 119 Squadron F-4 Phantoms (the squadron had retired the Mirage in 1970) launched from Rephidim to assist Israeli units under attack, and pilot Moshe Melnik with navigator Zvi Tal shot down an AS-5 Kelt launched by a Tu-16 as well as a Su-7. Later in the afternoon, a mixed pair consisting of a Phantom and an IAI Nesher scrambled from Rephidim to down several Mi-8 helicopters airlifting Egyptian commandos into the Sinai.Gordon, p. 289Norton, p. 236 That same night also saw the IAF deploying several helicopters to Rephidim for medevac (medical evacuation) duties.Gordon, p. 291 One Israeli CH-53 was shot down over the field on October 12, killing five crewmen.October 12, Southern Front on the Israeli Air Force website Israeli withdrawal and aftermath Following the Camp David Accords, Rephidim was the very first air base from which Israel withdrew in late 1979.1979 on the Israeli Air Force website Although the accords prohibit Egypt from maintaining combat aircraft in the Sinai,Peace Treaty Between the State of Israel and the Arab Republic of Egypt, Article III Bir Gifgafa is still operational as a dual military and civilian airport.

The lake gets its name from the method used by First Nations people to capture the bison using the natural topography as corrals or buffalo pounds. Bison once numbered more than 60 million, by 1900 they were all but extinct due to settlement. Bison were reintroduced into the area in 1972. The Qu'Appelle River was dammed by the Buffalo Pound Dam in 1939 to control fluctuating water levels. The dam is an embankment dam approximately 1400 metres long. A fish ladder installed in 1999-2000 allows fish to migrate in and out of the lake and new gates were installed to create a better water supply downstream. The height of the dam was also raised 1 metre. The problem with fluctuating water levels wasn't solved all together until the construction of the Qu'Appelle River Dam and Gardiner Dam that created Lake Diefenbaker 100 km upstream in 1967. As a result, water flow in the Qu'Appelle River now remains relatively constant. This, however, has flushed the lake out and allowed excessive algae growth due to the cleaner water which reduced the popularity of swimming and boating during the summer months, raised the cost of water treatment, and the lake still remains eutrophic, due to low oxygen levels and highly nutritious soil on the lake's bottom. The lake provides drinking water for the cities of Regina, Moose Jaw, and The Mosaic Company potash mine at Belle Plaine, approximately 25% of the province's population. It is also used for recreational purposes such as camping, boating, and fishing and is home to a host of fish species including walleye, sauger, yellow perch, northern pike, cisco, mooneye, lake whitefish, white sucker, channel catfish, burbot, bigmouth buffalo, and common carp. Buffalo Pound Provincial Park is located on the southern part of the lake and can be accessed by Highway 202 and Highway 301. Cabins can be rented or bought along the shores of the lake. Highway 2 crosses by causeway on the lake. The Moose Jaw River joins the Qu'Appelle River 5 km east of the dam.

Then, a set E=\\\\\\\\{E_a|a\\\\in [\\\\lambda]^{<\\\\omega}\\\\\\\\} is called a (κ,λ)-extender if the following properties are satisfied: # each Ea is a κ-complete nonprincipal ultrafilter on [κ]<ω and furthermore ## at least one Ea is not κ+-complete, ## for each \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\kappa, at least one Ea contains the set \\\\\\\\{s\\\\in[\\\\kappa]^{|a|}:\\\\alpha\\\\in s\\\\\\\\}. # (Coherence) The Ea are coherent (so that the ultrapowers Ult(V,Ea) form a directed system). # (Normality) If f is such that \\\\\\\\{s\\\\in[\\\\kappa]^{|a|}: f(s)\\\\in\\\\max s\\\\\\\\}\\\\in E_a, then for some b\\\\supseteq a,\\\\ \\\\\\\\{t\\\\in\\\\kappa^{|b|}:(f\\\\circ \\\\pi_{ba})(t)\\\\in t\\\\\\\\}\\\\in E_b. # (Wellfoundedness) The limit ultrapower Ult(V,E) is wellfounded (where Ult(V,E) is the direct limit of the ultrapowers Ult(V,Ea)). By coherence, one means that if a and b are finite subsets of λ such that b is a superset of a, then if X is an element of the ultrafilter Eb and one chooses the right way to project X down to a set of sequences of length |a|, then X is an element of Ea. More formally, for b=\\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_1,\\\\dots,\\\\alpha_n\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\alpha_1<\\\\dots<\\\\alpha_n<\\\\lambda, and a=\\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_{i_1},\\\\dots,\\\\alpha_{i_m}\\\\\\\\}, where m≤n and for j≤m the ij are pairwise distinct and at most n, we define the projection \\\\pi_{ba}:\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_1,\\\\dots,\\\\xi_n\\\\\\\\}\\\\mapsto\\\\\\\\{\\\\xi_{i_1},\\\\dots,\\\\xi_{i_m}\\\\\\\\}\\\\ (\\\\xi_1<\\\\dots<\\\\xi_n). Then Ea and Eb cohere if : X\\\\in E_a\\\\Leftrightarrow \\\\\\\\{s: \\\\pi_{ba}(s)\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}\\\\in E_b. Defining an extender from an elementary embedding Given an elementary embedding j:V→M, which maps the set-theoretic universe V into a transitive inner model M, with critical point κ, and a cardinal λ, κ≤λ≤j(κ), one defines E=\\\\\\\\{E_a|a\\\\in [\\\\lambda]^{<\\\\omega}\\\\\\\\} as follows: :\\\\text{for }a\\\\in[\\\\lambda]^{<\\\\omega}, X\\\\subseteq [\\\\kappa]^{<\\\\omega}:\\\\quad X\\\\in E_a\\\\Leftrightarrow a\\\\in j(X). One can then show that E has all the properties stated above in the definition and therefore is a (κ,λ)-extender.

He received a B.A. from Columbia University in Psychology in 1963, and a Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology (with a second speciality in Quantitative Methods) (1969) from the University of Maryland. Professional career From 1969 to 1971, Orme-Johnson served as a lecturer at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). While at UTEP, he conducted the first research on the effects of Transcendental Meditation (TM) on autonomic stability and autonomic recovery from stressors. The paper, published in Psychosomatic Medicine, the journal of the American Psychosomatic Society, reported fewer spontaneous galvanic skin responses (GSR) in meditators, and more rapid habituation of the GSR to loud tones.American Psychosomatic Society Orme-Johnson, D.

Orme- Johnson served as the Chairman of the Psychology Department and Dean of Research until 1996. In addition, he was director of its psychology doctoral program and co-director of its neuroscience doctoral program, and director of the university's Institute for World Peace. He also served as director of research at the Institute of Science, Technology, and Public Policy. According to Orme-Johnson he was Vice Chancellor of Maharishi European Research University, Seelisberg, Switzerland from 1975 to 1977 and Acting President of Maharishi University of Management from 1976 to 1977. In 1982, Orme-Johnson was the co-presenter for a report on Transcendental Meditation research given at Congressional hearings by the Subcommittees on International Security and Scientific Affairs to establish an Academy of Peace.

The paper was criticized in 1997 by University of Iowa professors Evan Fales and Barry Markovsky, who took issue with the Maharishi Effect theory and with Orme- Johnson's interpretation of evidence. They complained that Orme-Johnson refused to share his raw data and concluded that the probability of the Maharishi Effect theory was \\"very close to zero\\". Orme-Johnson defended his work in a 2009 paper. After reviewing their critique, he wrote that it was \\"not supported by either the empirical data nor by a logical analysis of the theory\\". He also noted that published plots of the raw data were given to Fales and Markovsky and that a simple visual inspection of these plots would have shown that their alternate hypotheses could not explain the study's results. The raw data is available on his website.\\"Societal Effects: Scholarly Exchanges on the Maharishi Effect\\" OJ's web site He participated in a delegation of teachers from Maharishi International University who traveled to the Soviet Union to provide instruction in Transcendental Meditation in 1990. The trip, initially scheduled to last ten days, was extended to six months and resulted in the training of 35,000 people in Transcendental Meditation. In 1990, he proposed that the U.S. Defense Department budget $90 million to hire 7,000 to 10,000 full-time meditators to improve society. In 1991, he advocated a plan for prisons to hire TM trainers, at a cost of $1,500 per inmate, to reduce recidivism and illness among prisoners. In response to a Wall Street Journal article that estimated it would cost $1 billion to teach TM to all inmates in the U.S., Orme-Johnson wrote that doing so would result in a net savings of $6.2 billion annually. In 1993, Orme-Johnson proposed that the city of Omaha, Nebraska spend $23 million for 600 meditators to end crime in the city. In 1995, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) nominated Orme-Johnson to be an expert presenter on the effects of meditation as a relaxation technique on chronic pain and insomnia at the NIH technology assessment conference held in Bethesda, Maryland.Orme-Johnson, D.W.; Walton, K.; Lonsdorf, N.

The film has been recognized by Robert Koehler in Variety as \\"the most complete visual account of Rodia and his masterpiece\\".  Production  Completed in 2006, I Build the Tower was directed, written and produced by Edward and Brad Byer. The project was initiated by Byer's extensive research into the life of Rodia, his great- uncle. With exclusive access to a wealth of family materials, Byer teamed up with independent filmmaker Edward who had been working with Watts community groups for several years. Together they started production by filming the last recorded interview with architect, designer and futurist Buckminster Fuller, three months before his death in 1983. Hailing Rodia as \\"one of the greatest sculptors of the twentieth century\\", Fuller analyzed Rodia's intuitive understanding of aesthetics and natural engineering principles. The filmmakers went on to shoot their film throughout Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and southern Italy, and managed to sustain the vitality of their work while waiting years for the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department to remove the scaffolding erected for the restoration of the towers. The narrative of the documentary is drawn from audio interviews of Rodia recorded in the early 1960s. In his own words and voice, Rodia himself chronicles his redemption from alcoholism and despair to a fierce determination to build \\"something big\\". The story is filled out by recent interviews with relatives, neighbors and other witnesses who have come into close contact with the Watts Towers, including artist John Outterbridge and historian Mike Davis. Phil Proctor of the Firesign Theater gives voice to historic trial proceedings involving Rodia. The film's musical score is based on the opera arias of Giuseppe Verdi – the music Rodia loved – and spans the time and distance from nineteenth century Italy to present-day Los Angeles. The classical score was arranged and conducted by noted silent film music composer Robert Israel. Jazz pianist Nate Morgan composed an original jazz score using Verdi's themes and performed by Morgan's ensemble. Filmmakers Byer and conceived a hip-hop song incorporating Rodia's own voice as lead vocal, backed up by jazz vocalists Dwight Trible and Logan Johnson, Jr., set to music by Michael Abels. In April, 2009, I Build the Tower was the opening presentation of \\"Art and Migration: Sabato Rodia's Watts Towers in Los Angeles\\", the first international conference on the Watts Towers. The conference was held in Genoa, Italy, sponsored by the University of Genoa and the U.C.L.A. International Institute.

In 2010, Americans generated about of trash. In the United States, landfills are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states' environmental agencies. Municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLF) are required to be designed to protect the environment from contaminants that may be present in the solid waste stream. A small local landfill facility in Homer, Alaska Some materials may be banned from disposal in municipal solid waste landfills including common household items such as paints, cleaners/chemicals, motor oil, batteries, pesticides, and electronics. These products, if mishandled, can be dangerous to health and the environment. Safe management of solid waste through guidance, technical assistance, regulations, permitting, environmental monitoring, compliance evaluation and enforcement is the goal of the EPA and state environmental agencies., NC Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  History  The Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill, opened in Fresno, California in 1937, is considered to have been the first modern, sanitary landfill in the United States, innovating the techniques of trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of waste with soil. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark, underlining the significance of waste disposal in urban society. The first federal legislation addressing solid waste management was the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 (SWDA) that created a national office of solid waste. By the mid-1970s, all states had some type of solid waste management regulations. In 1976, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) that dramatically expanded the federal government's role in managing waste disposal. RCRA divided wastes into hazardous and non-hazardous categories, and directed the EPA to develop design and operational standards for sanitary landfills and close or upgrade existing open dumps that did not meet the sanitary landfill standards.NSWMA Report, Modern Landfills: A Far Cry from the Past. In 1979, the EPA developed criteria for sanitary landfills that included siting restrictions in floodplains; endangered species protection; surface water protection; groundwater protection; disease and vector (rodents, birds, insects) control; opening burning prohibitions; explosive gas (methane) control; fire prevention through the use of cover materials; and prevention of bird hazards to aircraft., PART 257 - CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION OF SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES AND PRACTICES. The RCRA was amended in 1984. In 1991, the EPA established new federal standards for municipal solid waste landfills that updated location and operation standards, added design standards, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements for known environmental releases, closure and post-closure requirements and financial assurances to pay for landfill future care and maintenance., PART 258 - CRITERIA FOR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS.  Regulation  The EPA generally relies on the states to enforce their own operating permits and federal laws.Horinko, Marianne, Cathryn Courtin. “Waste Management: A Half Century of Progress.” EPA Alumni Association. March 2016. If state agencies are not aggressive, violations can worsen, multiplying negative environmental impacts exponentially. There are some notable recorded violations in the U.S. such as for a landfill in Hawaii that was fined $2.8 million in 2006 for operating violations, but this is not common. Modern landfills are specifically designed to protect human health and the environment by controlling water and air emissions. All MSWLF must comply with the federal regulations in 40 CFR Part 258, or equivalent state regulations. Some of the federal regulations in 40 CFR part 258 include: * Location Restrictions - landfills must be built in suitable geological areas away from faults, wetlands, flood plains or other restricted areas. * Composite Liners Requirements - include a flexible membrane (geomembrane) overlaying two feet of compacted clay soil lining the bottom and sides of the landfill, protect groundwater and the underlying soil from leachate releases. * Leachate Collection and Removal Systems - sit on top of the composite liner and removes leachate from the landfill for treatment and disposal. * Operating Practices - including the compacting and covering of waste frequently with several inches of soil to help reduce odor; control litter, insects and rodents; and protect public health. * Groundwater Monitoring Requirements - testing of groundwater wells must be done to determine whether waste materials have escaped from the landfill. * Closure and Postclosure Care Requirements - including covering landfills and providing long-term care of closed landfills. * Corrective Action Provisions - control and cleanup of landfill releases and achieves groundwater protection standards. * Financial Assurance - provides funding for environmental protection during and after landfill closure. Under Subtitle D of RCRA, states are required to adopt and implement permit programs to ensure that landfills in their states comply with relevant federal standards. The law also requires EPA to determine whether state permit programs are adequate to ensure such compliance. For permit programs to be approved, states must provide opportunities for public involvement during the permit application process. This may include public meetings or submission of concerns in writing to the permitting agency.EPA Procedures for Approving State Subtitle D Permitting Programs. In addition, states must have the power to issue permits and perform compliance monitoring and enforcement actions that ensure compliance with the federal standards. Agencies such as the Solid Waste Association of North America's (SWANA). Landfill Management Division provide training and technical advice related to the planning, design, construction, closure and post-closure of today's landfills. The division regularly monitors, reviews and comments on current legislative and regulatory actions that could potentially affect landfill operations and new technology.Legislative, Advocacy and Rulemaking. Waste Management, based in Houston, Texas, manages/operates five of the top 10 largest landfills and owns three of those outright. [Forbes]  Leachate Collection  Landfill leachate is generated from liquids existing in the waste as it enters a landfill or from rainwater that passes through the waste within the facility. The leachate consists of different organic and inorganic compounds that may be either dissolved or suspended. An important part of maintaining a landfill is managing the leachate through proper treatment methods designed to prevent pollution into surrounding ground and surface waters., Landfill Leachate Treatment . For landfills receiving hazardous waste, permits require landfill liners and the installation of systems for collecting leachate. Based on recent EPA studies, a liner and leachate collection system constructed to current standards typically has a liquid removal efficiency of 99 to 100 percent and frequently exceeds 99.99 percent. The leachate collection system collects the leachate so that it can be removed from the landfill and properly treated or disposed. Most leachate collection systems have the following components: Typical Anatomy of a Landfill . * Leachate collection layer - a layer of sand or gravel or a thick plastic mesh called a geonet collects leachate and allows it to drain by gravity to the leachate collection pipe system. * Filter Geotextile - a geotextile fabric, similar in appearance to felt, may be located at the top of the leachate collection pipe system to provide separation of solid particles from liquid. This prevents clogging of the pipe system. * Leachate Collection Pipe System - Perforated pipes, surrounded by a bed of gravel, transport collected leachate to specially designed low points called sumps. Pumps, located within the sumps, automatically remove the leachate from the landfill and transport it to the leachate management facilities for treatment or another proper method of disposal. Federal requirements mandate that treatment must meet drinking water quality standards, which are set to prevent harm to public health, or more stringent state standards to protect sensitive environments (high quality streams, trout streams).  Groundwater Monitoring  Nearly all municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) are required to monitor the underlying groundwater for contamination during their active life and post-closure care period.Groundwater Monitoring Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (MSWFs). The exceptions to this requirement are small landfills that receive less than 20 tons of solid waste per day, and facilities that can demonstrate that there is no potential for the migration of hazardous constituents from the unit into the groundwater. All other MSWLFs must comply with the groundwater monitoring requirements found at 40 CFR Part 258, Subpart E–Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective Action. The groundwater monitoring system consists of a series of wells placed upgradient and downgradient of the MSWLF. The samples from the upgradient wells shows the background concentrations of constituents in the groundwater while, the downgradient wells show the extent of groundwater contamination caused by the MSWLF. The required number of wells, spacing, and depth of wells is determined on a site- specific basis based on the aquifer thickness, groundwater flow rate and direction, and the other geologic and hydrogeologic characteristics of the site. All groundwater monitoring systems must be certified by a qualified groundwater scientist and must comply with the sampling and analytical procedures outlined in the regulations. There are three phases of groundwater monitoring requirements: * Detection Monitoring - monitoring for the 62 constituents listed in Appendix I of 40 CFR Part 258 and sampling that occurs at least semiannually throughout the landfill's active life and post-closure period. If any of the constituents is detected at a higher level than the established background level, state regulatory agencies must be notified and an assessment monitoring program begun. * Assessment monitoring - within 90 days of detection of an increase in constituents, a MSWLF must begin an assessment monitoring program. Samples must be taken from all wells and analyzed for the presence of all 214 constituents listed in Appendix II of 40 CFR Part 258. If any of the constituents are detected, background levels for these constituents and establish a groundwater protection standard (GWPS) for each. Within 90 days of establishing the background levels and GWPS, resamples for all constituents in Appendix I and Appendix II. Resampling must then be completed at least semiannually. Provided that levels remain within specified limits after two sampling events, the facility may return to the detection monitoring phase. If levels remain higher than standard, the owners/operators of the MSWLF must characterize the nature of the release, determine if contamination has migrated beyond the facility boundary, and begin assessing corrective measures. * Corrective measures - must be protective of human health and the environment, meet the GWPS, control the source(s) of the release to prevent further releases, and manage any solid waste generated in accordance with all applicable RCRA regulations. Remedial actions must continue until three years of consecutive compliance are met. JFK Presidential Library and Museum - category 3 landfill post-closure site  Post-closure and reclamation  In the U.S., the regulatory structure for landfills specifies a 30-year post-closure monitoring period. It is presumed that at the end of the 30-year period, the landfill will be stable and will no longer require intensive monitoring. Today, landfills are designed from the start to ensure protection of the environment and public health, and the safe and productive use of the site after closure. There are three categories of post- closure uses of landfill sites: Category 1 - open space, agricultural and passive recreation; Category 2 - Active recreation, parking or industrial/commercial activities; and Category 3 - Intensive uses such as residences, industry and commercial development. Category 1 post-closures are the most numerous and may be the least recognizable due to the fact they appear to be nothing more than an open field. Some examples include: Westview Sanitary Landfill in Georgia - now a cemetery and Griffith Park in California - used for hiking trails. Category 2 post-closures may have utilities, light structures or paving. Examples include Settler's Hill Landfill in Illinois - now golf courses and a minor league baseball field or the Germantown Sanitary Landfill in Wisconsin that is now a ski slope. Category 3 post-closures are usually characterized by inclusion of major structures. Some of the most well known are Mile High Stadium in Colorado which is the football stadium for the Denver Broncos; Brickyard Shopping Center in Illinois; and Columbia Point in Massachusetts, home of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and University of Massachusetts Boston's State Archives Building.  Statistics  The EPA has collected and reported data on the generation and disposal of waste in the United States for more than 30 years. Recent estimates state that the amount of municipal waste disposed of in US landfills per year is about as of 2013. Organic materials are estimated to be the largest component of MSW. Paper and paperboard account for 29% and yard trimmings and food scraps account for another 27%; plastics 12%; metals 9%, rubber, leather and textiles 8%; wood is approximately 6.4% and glass 5%. Other miscellaneous wastes make up approximately 3.4%. In 2010, Americans recovered almost 65 million tons of MSW (excluding composting) through recycling. Between 1980 and 2013, waste disposed in landfills decreased from 89% to under 53%. In 2013, about 32.7 million tons of MSW were combusted for energy recovery. Research has shown that leachate treatment facilities at modern landfills are capable of removing 100 percent of the trace organics and over 85 percent of the heavy metals. The Puente Hills Landfill is the largest landfill in America. Over of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated landfill site in 1957., Trash city: Inside America's largest landfill site. In 1986, there were 7,683 landfills in the United States. By 2009, there were just 1,908 landfills nationwide: a 75 percent decline in disposal facilities in less than 25 years., Landfills are safer than dumps, but trash must travel farther to reach them. However, this number is deceptive. Much of the decrease is due to consolidation of multiple landfills into a single, more efficient facility. Also technology has allowed for each acre of landfill to take 30% more waste. So during this time, the available landfill per person has increased by almost 30%.http://www.de- fact-o.com /fact_read.php?id=89  Notable landfills   See also  * Landfill gas * Environment of the United States * Environmental issues in the United States  References   Further reading         External links  * Landfill Methane Outreach Program at the EPA * Solid waste facilities in Massachusetts * Category:Waste in the United States Category:Environmental issues in the United States Category:Pollution in the United States ","title":"Landfills in the United States"},{"id":"24047201","text":"In the 1970s, the Stovall Sisters were a gospel trio of recording artists consisting of Lillian, Netta, and Joyce Stovall. Definitive works include the album The Stovall Sisters (Reprise Records 1970, Warner Music Group) which included the now funk/soul classic “Hang on in There.” They are also the featured background vocalists on the rock classic “Spirit In The Sky” (recorded by Norman Greenbaum, producer, Erik Jacobsen). Biography Born in Kentucky and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Stovall Sisters, now known as Nettie Stovall, Lillian Jackson, and Rejoyce Moss, were three of the exceptionally large family of twenty-two children of James and Della Stovall, and grew up touring with the family gospel group in the Midwest and the South. Their mother, Della Stovall, started each child singing around the age of two. The first Stovall family singing group was known as the Four Loving Sisters and consisted of the four eldest sisters: Dorothy, Billie, Frances, and Georgia. The group name was later changed to the Valley Wonders. Eventually the younger siblings, Wayne, Nettie, and Lillian, would join, followed by Joyce, Donald, and Jeanie. Prior to joining the Valley Wonders, Wayne, Nettie, Lillian, and Joyce performed in a separate family act known as God's Little Wonders. (A cousin, Evelyn Crosby, also performed with the group for a short time.) In the latter part of the 1950s, the family migrated to Oakland, Calif., where Lillian, Nettie, and Joyce would eventually form the Stovall Sisters (for a brief period the Stovall Sisters included the family's youngest sister, Jeanie Stovall). The Stovall Sisters performed and recorded songs in the genre that consisted of a gospel/R&B; fusion and maintained a successful career as professional studio and touring backup singers for an impressive list of well-known artists that include The Staple Singers, The Caravans, Bobby Womack & The Womack Brothers, Al Green & The Green Brothers, Ray Charles & The Blind Boys, The Harmonizing Four, The Soul Stirrers,The Salem Travelers,The Pilgrim Jubiees and{ Sylvester, The Davis Sisters and The Highway Q.C's, BB King, Big Mama Thornton, Etta James, Jimmy McCracklin, Bobby Bland, Charles Brown, Sugar Pie DeSanto, Earth Wind & Fire, Jackie Wilson, Joe Tex, Joe Simon, Parliament-Funkadelic, Sam Cooke, Cannonball Adley, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Norman Greenbaum. They also toured with Redd Foxx and Demond Wilson of Sanford & Son and briefly performed as the Ikettes with Ike & Tina Turner, 1967\\\\. Eventually, under contract with Warner/Reprise, they would record and release their sole gospel/R&B; crossover album, The Stovall Sisters (producer, Erik Jacobsen) which featured the now-considered classic funk/soul single “Hang On In There” (written by Rejoyce Moss). The Stovall Sisters would go on to record unreleased tracks for an album with Earth, Wind & Fire’s Philip Bailey and Maurice White but would disband before its release. After several years of separate and solo projects the sisters reunited in 2007 to continue to perform as the Stovall Sisters in numerous live performances and as studio backup singers, adding their unique gospel soul/funk signature sound to a new generation of music.

From the age of 16 until his death at the age of 20, McDonald discovered and mapped the first of Wind Cave using candlelight. His exploration and mapping was so extensive and thorough for the time that it was not until 1963, 70 years after his death, that major new passageways were discovered in Wind Cave.  Early life  McDonald was born in Franklin County, Iowa, and moved to Wind Cave, in the Black Hills of South Dakota, in 1890. His father, Jesse D. McDonald, had been hired in 1889 by the South Dakota Mining Company to oversee the company's \\"mining claim\\". It is not known if the mining company expected to find minerals of value in the cave or just planned on developing it for tourism. Regardless, the McDonald family eventually decided to attempt to make a living from the cave by developing it with enlarged passageways and wooden ladders and steps, with the hope of attracting travelers from the nearby resort town of Hot Springs.  Wind Cave exploration  Alvin McDonald fell in love with Wind Cave, and in the few years he lived there he systematically explored about of its subterranean passageways. He kept a journal in which he described his exploration of the cave and the naming of the rooms and passageways.Alvin McDonald's journal, Wind Cave National Park, National Park Service, USA. McDonald explored the cave entirely by candlelight and rolled out string to mark his way out of the cave. He shared his passion for the cave with visitors by becoming, in his own words, \\"the chief guide\\" at Wind Cave. Several of the modern tours offered by the National Park Service through the cave follow McDonald's original tour routes. McDonald spent many hours almost every day for more than three years exploring and guiding within the cave. He was known to explore newly discovered passageways during his tours as well as on his own. Once, after being out of the cave for two days due to an illness, he wrote in his journal, \\"am homesick for the cave\\". He quickly realized the complex nature of the cave and wrote in his journal, \\"have given up the idea of finding the end of Wind Cave\\". Though he appreciated the beauty and natural features of the cave, McDonald, like others of his era, often removed samples of cave formations to sell to visitors. He would only remove samples from the cave in areas where he did not take visitors.  Death  McDonald died of typhoid fever at the age of 20, on December 15, 1893. It is believed he contracted the disease in Chicago, where he had been promoting the cave and exhibiting samples at the Columbian Exposition the previous summer. Some people have speculated that continued exposure to the cool, damp air of the cave caused him to yield to complications from the typhoid. McDonald was buried near the entrance to the cave he loved so dearly. A bronze plaque on a stone marks his grave, which is located on a hill above the natural entrance to Wind Cave, north of the park's visitor center. Photographs of Alvin McDonald, mementos, and his original journal are on display in the lower exhibit room of the visitor center.  Legacy  Alvin McDonald's exploration of Wind Cave and eagerness to share it with others likely contributed to the creation and development of Wind Cave National Park, the seventh national park in the United States, in 1903. It is assumed that there are areas of Wind Cave that McDonald explored that no one else has since visited. Occasionally pieces of McDonald's string are discovered by survey teams in Wind Cave. As recently as August 2009, McDonald's signature was discovered carved into the ceiling of a room in the cave where it had been assumed no person had ever visited. The signature was dated July 1893, making it the latest known dated signature left by Alvin McDonald in Wind Cave.

Basic types are considered to be built using nullary type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for product types, function types, power types and list types. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors. For example, simply typed lambda calculus can be seen as a language with a single type constructor--the function type constructor. Product types can generally be considered \\"built-in\\" in typed lambda calculi via currying. Abstractly, a type constructor is an n-ary type operator taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type. Making use of currying, n-ary type operators can be (re)written as a sequence of applications of unary type operators. Therefore, we can view the type operators as a simply typed lambda calculus, which has only one basic type, usually denoted *, and pronounced \\"type\\", which is the type of all types in the underlying language, which are now called proper types in order to distinguish them from the types of the type operators in their own calculus, which are called kinds. Type operators may bind type variables. For example, giving the structure of the simply-typed λ-calculus at the type level requires binding, or higher-order, type operators. These binding type operators correspond to the 2nd axis of the λ-cube, and type theories such as the simply-typed λ-calculus with type operators, λω. Combining type operators with the polymorphic λ-calculus (System F) yields System Fω.

History In 1966, after a decade of involvement with local musical ensembles, Marjorie Rawlins of Palo Alto founded the American Association of University Women Midpeninsula Chorus, with 17 members. She soon recognised the limitations of working within the AAUW graduates' organisation, and abandoned the affiliation; the choir was subsequently renamed the University Women’s Chorus. The principles established from the outset were that, although the choir was informal, its aims would be ambitious. In particular, members were expected to sing all pieces from memory, and the repertoire was to be ambitious, with many pieces sung in foreign languages. When Mrs Rawlins left in 1975, the members, by then increased to over 50, appointed 25-year-old Patricia (Patty) Hennings as their new director. Under her leadership the choir, soon rechristened the Peninsula Women's Chorus to emphasize its inclusive recruiting policy (though it maintained an association with Foothill College), continued to increase its standards, andPeninsula Women's Chorus Turns 40!

The scandal broke on 11 April 2009 when it was reported by the Daily Telegraph that Gordon Brown's special adviser, Damian McBride, had sent a series of emails to left wing political blogger Derek Draper discussing plans to set up the blog which would be used to post false rumours about the private lives of senior members of the Conservative Party and their spouses. The website was never launched according to The Register. Exposed by Guido Fawkes The emails, which had been sent from the Downing Street Press Office, found their way to Paul Staines who blogs under the pseudonym of Guido Fawkes. Website Draper and McBride initially tried to play down the plans. McBride stated \\"To call it an orchestrated smear campaign is ridiculous. It was just some ill-judged gossip between friends which was never meant to see the light of day. They appear to be some ideas — laid out in embarrassing detail — for stories which could appear on a Left-wing version of the Guido Fawkes blog called Red Rag. They’re all stories which have been doing the rounds in Westminster for a while, written up in a scurrilous style. But the website has never appeared, so it’s hard to see what it was all about.\\" However, it quickly became apparent that the plans were much more fully developed. Phil Hendren, who blogs under the pseudonym of Dizzy Thinks, stated that The Red Rag had in fact been set up in November 2008. This was followed up in the mainstream media later that day led by an article in The Observer which also reported that McBride had resigned. Following a formal complaint to Nominet made by Ian Mansfield the theredrag.co.uk domain was delisted. Mr Mansfield then bought the domain and redirected it to order-order.comDomain transferred to Ian Mansfield in The Red Rag which in an act of irony is the blogsite of Guido Fawkes.Redirection to Fawkes Blog from whois References External links *The Red Rag *Guido Fawkes Website Category:British political blogs ","title":"Red Rag"},{"id":"24047362","text":"Odzaberd (; meaning \\"Serpent's Fortress\\"; formerly Teyseba referring to the Urartian fortification and named after the god Teisheba; also known as Ishkanaberd meaning \\"Lord's Fortress\\") is located upon a hill east of the town of Tsovinar and at the south-east corner of Lake Sevan in the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia. Odzaberd is situated at a height of .Odzaberd Altitude and Location  Teyseba  Teyseba (; later Ishkanaberd meaning \\"Lord's Fortress\\" and Odzaberd meaning \\"Serpent's Fortress\\") is located east of the town of Tsovinar and at the south-east corner of Lake Sevan in the Gegharkunik Province of Armenia. It is an important archaeological site because it was once a fortified city of the Urartian Kingdom founded by Rusa I between 735 and 713 BC, and is considered the best preserved Urartian fortification in the Sevan basin. Amongst the ruins, stone foundations and portions of the city wall and gates are still visible. There is also an entrance to a small cave located on the western face of the hill within the ruins of Teyseba. Carved into the rock face on a low cliff at the base of the hill which the city was built upon (located north and along the road), is an ancient cuneiform inscription written by Rusa I. It relates that the city was built in dedication to the god Teisheba and speaks of the conquest by Rusa I of twenty- three nations as well. The etymology of Sevan was also found in the inscription and is considered to be the first such mention of the word that now relates to the lake that the ruins are located. Cuneiform inscription by Rusa I Local folklore tells that Lake Sevan was at a much higher elevation during this time, and that the city of Teyseba had been built along its shoreline. During the Soviet era the lake was lowered 19 meters, and has now stabilized to 20 meters (65 feet) below where it once was. It is said that the cuneiform inscription had been carved into the cliff face to prevent it from being defaced. Due to the water level being so much higher at the time, the location of the inscription would have been virtually inaccessible. It is also said that what is now a modern cemetery located on a rocky outcrop north of the village of Tsovinar, was during Urartian times an island with a small village that had been destroyed by lava flow that came up from below the lake. Local residents tell that ancient coins and bones have been found when digging new graves in the cemetery. The island has since dwindled in size. During the medieval period, one of the lords of the land rebuilt the stone defences to serve as his fortress at the same site and it went by the name Ishkanaberd meaning \\"Lord's Fortress\\". It was taken by the lord of the nearby town of Khrber because of a dispute between the two over his wife. After destroying the fortress he said, “Now nothing shall live in this land except snakes and scorpions!” It was referred to henceforth as Odzaberd meaning “Serpent’s Fortress”.  Folklore  Karmrashen During the medieval period, the lord of the land rebuilt the ancient stone defences of Teyseba to serve as his fortress. It went by the name Ishkanaberd, meaning \\"Lord's Fortress\\". Ishkanaberd was situated approximately eight kilometers northwest from another fortified town referred to as Karmrashen or \\"Khrber\\" by local residents. The name Khrber is derived from the local dialect of the villages surrounding southeast Lake Sevan and roughly translates to “ruins”. Foundations of stone structures, walls of a church, large tombs and a medieval graveyard may still be seen at ancient Karmrashen which sits nestled in the mountains near Lake Sevan. There is also a late 14th-century monument named Yot Verk Matur meaning \\"Seven Wounds Chapel\\", dedicated to seven lords of seven villages who were killed during the invasions of Timur Lenk. Local folklore tells that the lord of Karmrashen had a wife, and that the lord of Ishkanaberd sought to have her as his own even though he was already married. An affair ensued between the two, and before long the lord of Karmrashen discovered this and became furious. The ruler declared that he would destroy Ishkanaberd, which was considered impenetrable because of its very thick defensive walls. The lord of Ishkanaberd's wife had also learned of the affair and while he was sleeping, she bound him so that he could not escape and went to let her husband's rival into the walled fortress. The wife of the lord of Karmrashen whom the other lord was having an affair with learned what had happened and came to free her lover. She successfully did so and the two of them escaped with their lives from Ishkanaberd that night on horseback through a cave and tunnel located in close proximity to the fortress. The cave may still be seen to this day and the entrance is quite large. It is said that during those days the tunnel to the cave led from Ishkanaberd to a village some distance away, and that the tunnel which has since collapsed could fit a person sitting on horseback from one end to the other. Ishkanaberd was destroyed by the other lord who proclaimed, “Now nothing shall live in this land except snakes and scorpions!” Therefore the name was referred to henceforth as Odzaberd meaning “Serpent’s Fortress”. Folklore from the village of Tsovinar also tells that there was a ceramic pipe situated subsurface that led from the foothills nearby to Ishkanaberd. During medieval times invasions were a threat in and around the villages, and prevented shepherds from venturing into them to bring their milk. So they instead sent milk from the mountains to the village via a ceramic pipeline.

It is likely involved in maintaining cellular redox balance and plays a role in microbial resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin. Structure Chemically, it is a glycoside formed between L-cysteinyl-D-glucosamine and malic acid. It was isolated and identified (as its bacillithiol-S-bimane derivative) in 2009 from Staphylococcus aureus and Deinococcus radiodurans, although it was first detected in 2007, as an unidentified thiol in Bacillus anthracis. The naturally occurring free thiol form of bacillithiol has since been synthesised and characterised along with its biosynthetic precursors and its symmetrical disulfide. Biological role Bacillithiol appears to participate in the sensing of peroxides by Bacillus, but may also substitute for glutathione, which is the most common intracellular thiol in eukaryotes and some bacteria. Some of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of bacillithiol were identified and characterized in 2010. Bacteria engineered to be deficient in bacillithiol demonstrated increased sensitivity to various electrophilic xenobiotic compounds, including the antibiotic fosfomycin, suggesting that in these organisms the mechanism of fosfomycin resistance relies on the presence of bacillithiol. Furthermore, in vitro kinetic studies have established that bacillithiol is a preferred thiol substrate for the antibiotic resistance enzyme FosB. Biosynthesis Bacillithiol is produced via the enzymes BshA, BshB, and BshC. BshA replaces the UDP group on UDP-N- acetylglucosamine with an L-malyl group. BshB then removes the acetyl group. L-Cysteine is added to the resulting free amine, which completes the biosynthesis of the molecule. The cysteine-adding step is assumed to be carried out by the enzyme BshC on the basis of genetic knockout studies, but the activity of BshC has not been observed in vitro.

He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1980 and was given the rank of archbishop and named Apostolic Nuncio to Burundi in 2000. He died of gunshot wounds suffered in a violent attack thought to be unrelated to Burundi's civil war. According to his brother, Courtney was the first papal nuncio to die as the result of violence in 500 years. Biography Michael Aidan Courtney was born in Summerhill, Nenagh, County Tipperary, the youngest of seven children born to Louis and Elizabeth Courtney. He attended Clongowes Wood College, Clonfert Seminary, studied for 1 year in University College Dublin before going to the Irish College in Rome. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Clonfert on 9 March 1968. He worked as a curate until 1973, then as chaplain to Tynagh mines while teaching at St Raphael's College, Loughrea, and then as a curate in Woodford. He returned to Rome in 1976 to earn a licentiate in canon law and a doctorate in moral theology and to prepare for a diplomat's career at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. In 1987 he was awarded an MA in legal philosophy at NUI, Galway. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 25 March 1980, working at nunciatures in South Africa, Senegal, India, Yugoslavia, Cuba, and Egypt. He was named the Special Envoy and Permanent Observer to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 30 December 1995. Pope John Paul II appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Burundi and Titular Archbishop of Eanach Dúin on 18 August 2000. He received episcopal ordination on 12 November 2000 at St Mary of the Rosary Church in Nenagh from Cardinal Francis Arinze, Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, with Bishops John Kirby and William Walsh as co-consecrators. Courtney was instrumental in the November 2003 signing of a peace agreement between the Burundian government and the main opposition Hutu group. He was anticipating a new assignment as nuncio to Cuba, where he had established a warm relationship with Fidel Castro. Death and funeral In December 2003, as Courtney was returning to Bujumbura from a funeral, gunmen fired at his car near Minago, 30 miles south of the capital. He suffered gunshot wounds to the head, shoulder and leg and died from hemorrhaging during surgery at La Prince Louis Rwagasore Hospital in Bujumbura. Archbishop Simon Ntamwana blamed the militant Hutu National Liberation Forces (FNL), but the FNL, which supported the November agreement, denied any responsibility and said Ntamwana should leave the country. A crowd of 1500 attended a funeral Mass for Courtney in Burundi on 31 December. On 3 January 2004, Cardinals Arinze and Connell, Archbishop Seán Brady, Archbishop Giuseppe Lazzarotto, the Nuncio to Ireland, led a concelebrated funeral Mass in Nenagh. Minister for Defence Michael Smith represented the Government of Ireland at the Mass and burial. Courtney was buried at Dromineer on the shores of Lough Derg, County Tipperary, near his native Nenagh.

Cote was last seen alive in the area of Gardner, Massachusetts on March 4, 1984.

Florida April 20, 2000. Randall was never charged with an offence relating to Cote's death but evidence relating to the investigation was raised in the subsequent Evans/Pugh murder trial. In the late 1980s a Massachusetts court convicted James Randall of an incident of sexual battery of Linda Randall, which occurred on July 18, 1986. Later the same year James was convicted of two counts of sexual battery and one count of kidnapping, also relating to Linda Randall.TampaBay.com Killer escapes death, but not a life in prison September 23, 2000 He was sentenced to five to seven years imprisonment for these offences and spent time in a Massachusetts prison until his release in 1992. After his release Randall moved to Florida and got a job as a window installer. Murders of Wendy Evans and Cynthia Pugh On October 20, 1995, Wendy Evans, a suspected Florida prostitute, was killed by strangulation; her naked body was found on Myrtle Lane in Oldsmar by a pizza delivery driver later the same day. On January 18, 1996, Cynthia Pugh, another Florida prostitute, was also killed by strangulation, her body being discovered on January 19, 1996. Police identified James Randall as a person of interest in relation to both deaths after finding tire marks that matched Randall's Dodge D-50 pick-up truck. Police went to speak to Randall on June 27, 1996, at his residence. Following that conversation police observed Randall leaving his premises in his truck and attempted to stop him to ask further questions, but Randall instead accelerated away from police and a high-speed chase between Randall and police followed. Following the conclusion of the chase Randall continued to flee on foot and escaped, although he was eventually found and detained four days later (July 1, 1996).TampaBay.com Killer sentenced to 5 years for fleeing police April 16, 1997 Police investigations revealed that Randall had a history of engaging in consensual erotic asphyxiation with his sexual partners, along with allegations of non- consensual violent attacks on his then-girlfriend Terry-Jo Howard involving in part attempts to choke her. In April 1997 Randall was convicted by a Florida jury of first-degree murder in the strangulation deaths of both women. Sentencing judge Susan Schaeffer found three aggravating factors in the offence, being (1) that Randall had a previous conviction for a felony, (2) that the previous conviction was for a violent felony, and (3) that the murders were especially heinous, callous or cruel. Taking these factors into account, the court sentenced Randall to two death sentences in relation to the murders.TampaBay.com Prostitutes' killer sentenced to death, April 5, 1997 He was also sentenced to a concurrent sentence of five years on a charge of evading police. Randall appealed the murder convictions; his appeal was heard by the Supreme Court of Florida in 2000. The court upheld the appeals and found that Randall had most likely choked Evans and Pugh for pleasure, not to kill them. Accordingly, the conviction for first-degree murder was replaced with a conviction for second-degree murder in relation to both deaths, and his death sentences were changed to sentences of life imprisonment. Randall is held in Taylor C. I. Annex, Perry, Florida. The murders of Evans and Pugh have been featured on true crime television shows including Forensic Files (season 6, \\"Treads and Threads\\"); The New Detectives (season 6, \\"Left at the Scene\\"); and Evil Lives Here (season 4, \\"In the Lion's Cage\\"). Other deaths Randall has been the target of allegations that he was involved in other deaths in Massachusetts and Florida. The initial investigations that linked Randall to the deaths of Evans and Pugh involved inquiry into a series of deaths involving female victims, many of them prostitutes, who were killed by strangulation and whose bodies were found naked. The St Petersburg Times reported that when the imprisoned Randall was informed by detectives he would be charged with the murders of Cynthia Pugh and Wendy Evans, he replied, \\"Is that all?\\"St Petersburg Times, Suspicions widen in prostitute slaying case 19 September 1996 Although investigations are continuing, no charges have been laid against Randall relating to other deaths.

XXII in which the Hanseatics preserved their constitutional privileges granted in 1189 by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, until the German Revolution of 1918–19 and the Weimar Constitution.The historical science assumes a timocratic or oligarchic character of Hamburg's constitution, being the reason why Hamburg at the Congress of Vienna was accepted by the princes of the German states as a member of the German Confederation – Peter Borowsky, ', in: ', Hamburg, p. 93) Hamburg was strictly republican, but it was not a democracy, but rather an oligarchy. The Hanseaten were regarded as being of equal rank to the (landed) nobility elsewhere in Europe, although the Hanseaten often regarded the (rural) nobility outside the city republics as inferior to the (urban and often more affluent, and in their own view, cultivated) Hanseaten. Thomas Mann, a member of a Lübeck Hanseatic family, portrayed this class in his Nobel Prize-winning novel Buddenbrooks (1901), for which he received the 1929 Nobel Prize for Literature. Relationship to the nobility First Mayor Johann Heinrich Burchard The relationship between the Hanseatic and noble families varied depending on the city. The most republican city was Hamburg, where the nobility was banned, from the 13th century to the 19th century, from owning property, participating in the political life of the city republic, and even from living within its walls. Hamburg, however, was not a true democracy, but rather an oligarchy, with the Hanseaten as its elite occupying the position held by noble and princely families elsewhere. According to Richard J. Evans, \\"the wealthy of nineteenth-century Hamburg were for the most part stern republicans, abhorring titles, refusing to accord any deference to the Prussian nobility, and determinedly loyal to their urban background and mercantile heritage.\\" Many grand burghers considered the nobility inferior to Hanseatic families. A marriage between a daughter of a Hanseatic family and a noble was often undesired by the Hanseaten. From the late 19th century, being integrated into a German nation state, a number of Hanseatic families were nevertheless ennobled (by other German states, e.g. Prussia), but this was often met with criticism among their fellow Hanseaten. As the Hanseatic banker Johann von Berenberg-Gossler was ennobled in Prussia in 1889, his sister Susanne, married Amsinck, exclaimed \\"' [But John, our good name!]\\" Upon hearing of the ennoblement of Rudolph Schröder (1852–1938) of the ancient Hanseatic Schröder family, Hamburg First Mayor Johann Heinrich Burchard remarked that the Prussian King could indeed \\"place\\" (') Schröder among the nobles, but he could not \\"elevate\\" (') a Hanseatic merchant.

As of the 2010 census, the population of the community was 104. History Volga German immigrants founded and settled Catharine in April 1876, naming it after Katharinenstadt, the town they came from in Russia. Katharinenstadt was the economic center of the German colonies in Russia and, as a result, Catharine's settlers were initially wealthier than those of other Volga German settlements in the area. More German settlers from Katharinenstadt arrived over the next two years followed by Austrians from Moravia beginning in 1878. The community's first school opened in 1879 and doubled as a church until the completion of St. Catherine's Catholic Church in 1892. The first post office in Catharine opened in 1882.

The song is a tribute to the British supercentenarian Harry Patch, the last surviving soldier to have fought in the trenches during World War I. Radiohead self-released it on 5 August 2009 as a downloadable single for £1 from their website, with all proceeds donated to The Royal British Legion. It was rereleased as a single on Remembrance Day 2016, with new artwork by longtime Radiohead artist Stanley Donwood. Recorded in an abbey shortly before Patch's death, the song consists of Thom Yorke's vocals and a string arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood, absent of Radiohead's typical mix of rock and electronic instrumentation. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the First World War, and include modifications of quotations from Patch. While reception to the song was generally positive, with many critics praising the song's message, others criticised it as too sombre. The Patch family voiced their approval of the song's message and the band's charitable use of the proceeds. Recording According to a post by Yorke on Radiohead's blog Dead Air Space, \\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\\" was inspired by a \\"very emotional\\" 2005 interview with Harry Patch on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4. Yorke wrote that \\"The way he talked about war had a profound effect on me.\\" The song was recorded live in an abbey, only a few weeks before Patch died on 25 July 2009 at the age of 111.  Composition  \\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\\" has no standard rock instrumentation, and instead comprises Yorke's vocals and an orchestral string arrangement composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Strings introduce the song with a series of repeated arpeggiated notes, which continue as Yorke's singing begins. There is a bridge described as a \\"grim, delicately furious peak\\" halfway through the song. Pitchfork writer Mark Richardson compared the track to Gavin Bryars' 1971 composition Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet and Samuel Barber's 1936 Adagio for Strings. Critics from Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, and The Daily Telegraph drew comparisons to Greenwood's score to the film There Will Be Blood; however, Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal believed that the two works \\"[bear] no resemblance\\". Andrea Rice of American Songwriter wrote that the song's style was far removed from \\"anything emblematic of Radiohead\\". While Radiohead has expressed anti-war sentiments in the past—including a contribution to the 1995 War Child charity compilation The Help Album—\\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\\" marks the first time that a Radiohead song explicitly refers to war in its lyrics, marking a departure from Yorke's typically abstract writing. The lyrics are from the perspective of a soldier in the midst of First World War trench warfare. Several lines, including \\"Give your leaders each a gun and let them fight it out themselves\\" and \\"The next will be chemical, but they will never learn\\", are adapted from quotations by Patch. Both Luke Lewis of NME and Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly likened the lyrics to Wilfred Owen's First World War-era poem Dulce et Decorum est. Rice referred to Yorke's voice in the song as an \\"innocent and youthful falsetto\\"; the NME said his singing is \\"subdued to the point where you really need to read the lyrics\\". Release \\"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)\\" premiered on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on the morning of 5 August 2009, one day before Patch's burial. It became available for purchase later that day on Radiohead's online store W.A.S.T.E. as a download for £1, or US$1.68 at the time of release. All proceeds are donated to The Royal British Legion, a charity supporting those who are serving or have served in the British Armed Forces. The track could also be streamed from the Today section of BBC Online, where it was posted along with a description and the lyrics. Based on internet traffic data for Radiohead's website taken from Alexa Internet, The Guardians Chris Salmon believed that if the single had been released conventionally it would have likely entered the UK Singles Chart top ten. The song's unconventional release, carried out \\"in classic Radiohead fashion\\" according to Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters, was praised by The Guardians John Harris: \\"Welcome, once again, to the future of popular music: no need for albums, or marketing campaigns, or grand announcements—just a song by Radiohead, recorded mere weeks ago, premiered on yesterday's Today programme, and now available to download.\\" Caleb Garning of Wired noted the song's \\"abrupt creation\\" and the sudden announcement of their album The King of Limbs as part of Radiohead's move towards an unpredictable release schedule for new recorded material. In a feature for The Quietus, Wyndham Wallace argued that the track's release is in line with broader music industry trends towards \\"instant gratification\\", initiated by the digital release of Radiohead's previous album In Rainbows (2007). Reception alt=An elderly man in a wheelchair near a small lake in the English countryside. Critical reception to the song was generally positive. Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal described it as \\"a masterly achievement\\", highlighting Yorke's \\"eerie\\" vocals and Greenwood's \\"elegant\\" arrangement, and concluding that \\"with Radiohead, the unexpected isn't merely a ploy. It's a new approach to modern music that's often thrilling.\\" Dan Martin of The Guardian described the song as \\"a desolate lament over bleak, circling strings that build as the song progresses\\" and wrote that \\"considering the solemnity of the subject, the song finds Radiohead at their most understated and serene\\". Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song \\"a gorgeous anti-war ballad\\" and said that \\"Needless to say, it's very much worth any Radiohead fan's pound, regardless of the exchange rate.\\" NME named the track as one of the ten best tracks of the week and called it an \\"elegaic\\", \\"affecting, slow-burn statement\\" that \\"rather than hectoring, [...] states simply the horrors of war that Patch spoke so movingly about\\". Critic Allan Raible of ABC News compared the song to earlier Radiohead songs \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" and \\"Pyramid Song\\" and called it \\"one of the most beautiful compositions Thom Yorke and company have ever released.\\" Richardson gave the song a score of seven out of ten in Pitchforks song review feature The Playlist, and wrote that while it could be criticized as \\"a noble but failed experiment, overly maudlin and sentimental even if it is surface-level pretty\\", the song's \\"simplicity and unsubtle affect, especially coming from this band, wind up being strengths.\\" In a later column, Richardson would further defend the song from charges of excessive sentimentality and attributes the song's emotional success to its severe subject, death: \\"If these pieces were connected to thoughts of breaking up with a girlfriend or getting fired or lamenting cold weather or any of a million other of life's tragedies, they wouldn't work, at least not in the same way. They need that huge weight [of death] [...] on the other end to balance them out.\\" Kyle Anderson of MTV.com called the song a \\"slow, florid affair\\" and placed its \\"typically dark\\" lyrics in the context of Radiohead's previous political activism, such as their participation in the anti-human trafficking MTV EXIT campaign. Praise for the song was not universal. Rob Harvilla of Village Voice wrote that the track offered \\"nothing terribly earth-shattering\\" and thought that \\"the contrast between Thom's dolphin-soothing calm and lyrics like 'I've seen hell upon this earth/The next one will be chemical/But they will never learn' might just ruin your lunch.\\" David Malitz of The Washington Post complained: \\"It's a little too Sigur Ros-y and doesn't really go anywhere\\" but acknowledged it \\"[s]till kept my interest for five and half minutes\\". Patch's grandson Roger Patch voiced his family's approval of the song, saying: > Our family is very touched that Radiohead has reached out to its followers > and especially the younger generation through the single that echoes Harry's > interview in 2005. Harry loved music and would be 100 percent behind > Radiohead in raising awareness of the suffering of conflict—not least the > futility of it—in a way that can also benefit the Legion. It's a great idea > which we support > wholeheartedly.https://www.nme.com/news/music/radiohead-386-1306879 Peter Cleminson, national chairman of The Royal British Legion, thanked Radiohead for their support and said \\"Radiohead has picked up the torch from Harry Patch to hold it high. Radiohead uses Harry's own words to remind us of the horrors of war, and we believe Harry would be pleased.\\"https://www.billboard.com/articles//1267029/radiohead-pays-tribute- to-ww1-veteran See also * Last Post, a poem in memory of Patch by British poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy References External links * Download page * BBC Today programme page with link to the Harry Patch interview that inspired the song * Category:2009 singles Category:Radiohead songs Category:Charity singles Category:Songs in memory of deceased persons Category:Songs about military officers Category:Songs written by Thom Yorke Category:Songs written by Colin Greenwood Category:Songs written by Jonny Greenwood Category:Songs written by Philip Selway Category:Songs written by Ed O'Brien Category:2009 songs Category:Anti-war songs ","title":"Harry Patch (In Memory Of)"},{"id":"24047599","text":"For the style of bags made by some indigenous people in Panama, see Ngobe- Bugle A set of chácaras Chácaras are a type of castanets from the Canary Islands. They are an idiophonic and chattering instrument, with an interior cavity. It is typically made of moral wood. Chácaras are used in the traditional music of the islands of El Hierro and La Gomera, the latter being very big, bigger than the hands of the player. They are often accompanied by tambor drums and chanting, and by dancers performing the baile de tambor (drum dance). When playing, a pair of chácaras is held in each hand, secured by the cord, and the hands are shaken. The macho (male) chácara, with a deeper sound, held in one hand, sets the rhythm, and the hembra (female) chácara, in the other hand, is the one that chimes. In the other islands there are similar smaller instruments, but they are called castañuelas (castanets). Despite not appearing in the archaeological record, etymological analysis suggests a pre- colonial Guanche origin for this instrument, its name possibly related to Berber words such as šakar, meaning \\"hoof\\".

Walker has a post office with ZIP code 67674.ZIP Code Lookup History Settlers from Ohio founded Walker in 1872. They likely named the settlement for Robert J. Walker, the 4th Territorial Governor of Kansas. From 1876 to 1878, they were joined by Volga German immigrants and Plattdeutsch-speaking Germans from Ohio and Kentucky who settled in the area. The first post office in Walker opened in 1873, closed temporarily in 1876, and then reopened in 1878. St. Ann's Church was built and dedicated in 1905. The community's first school was built in 1893, followed by a second building in 1925. The school has since closed but remains in use as a community center. In 1942, the U.S. Army built Walker Army Airfield one mile northwest of Walker. During World War II, thousands were stationed at the airfield, mostly for training in operation of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber aircraft. The military closed the base in 1946. Construction of Interstate 70 reached Walker in 1966, passing immediately south of the community. Geography Walker is located at (38.8672339, -99.0759271) at an elevation of 1,942 feet (592 m). It lies approximately 1.5 miles (2.3 km) west of Walker Creek, part of the Smoky Hill River watershed, in the Smoky Hills region of the Great Plains. Walker is immediately north of Interstate 70 roughly 13 miles (21 km) east of Hays, the county seat. Transportation Walker Avenue, a paved county road, runs north-south through Walker, intersecting Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40, which run concurrently east-west, immediately south of town. The old alignment of U.S. 40, now a paved county road, runs northeast- southwest through Walker. The Kansas Pacific (KP) line of the Union Pacific Railroad runs northeast-southwest through Walker, parallel to the old alignment of U.S. 40.

Population: In 2001, population was 2,670.  History  Jewish population Chaim-Leyzer Perelmuter Nehemia Aronov Kiselgof-Naumov The earliest known information on the Kamianyi Brid Jewish community dates from the 1850s. The Zusmans' faience factory operated here since 1862. Three synagogues operated here for decades (including one, at the factory's territory, which was closed, to be transferred to the local club, in 1928). Local Jews were adherents of the Chernobyl chassidism. Their last Rebbe (Tsadick, or leader) was Gersh-Leib (Zvi-Arie) Tverskiy Z”L, of Berdichev / Makarov (Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)). A.-F. Zusman, the owner of the Kamianyi Brid faience factory, also lived in Berdichev, not far from the Tsadik's residence. In 1919, there was a pogrom in Kamianyi Brid, which took lives of more than 200 Jewish men, including the local rabbi Shmuel Shvartzstein. The Jewish cemetery was founded here after pogrom as the burial place for its victims. Later this cemetery was used as the burial place for the Jews from the neighboring village of Dovbysch. The cemetery survived, however, the majority of gravestones have been destroyed, and inscriptions have become unreadable. The cemetery was divided into two parts: for males and for females. Until 1917, the local Bund's branch operated here. Nehemia Kiselgof, the head of a small local hospital, was one of outstanding personalities of this shtetl. He was the main organizer of working-class movement in the Kamianyi Brid. He was known in the workers' circle under a pseudonym “Naumov”. Also Haim-Lejzer Perelmuter son of Moishe-Bir Perelmiter,History of Perelmuter family born in Baranivka, became a member of the Bund party and an active revolutionary (finally he became the chief of the first post-office of Kamianyi Brid). Presently, no Jews live in Kamianyi Brid, and the faience factory is not in operation. At the factory, the museum of Kamianyi Brid has been founded.

It is actually caused by numerous different factors. In first world countries it is often related to surgical infections, but is, in impoverished countries and massive tropical areas most indefinitely related directly to a parasite infestation of the urinary tract or intestines by Schistosoma haematobium - also known as snail fever. A disease caused by the parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. Most commonly effected are farming communities that live and work in humid marshes and waterlogged places such as the rice fields throughout Asia, where most young boys unknowingly contract Schistosoma, where then the parasite begins to cause damage internally throughout their stomach and intestines. The labour combined with parasites eating away at organ walls causes haemorrhage bleeding from multiple orifices (mainly the urethra, anus). Locals, uneducated at best, thought that it was strange but not of major concern before modern medical knowledge and so referred to it as the male equivalent of female menstruation. In far more, less reported cases, it is found that boys in an effected area who work in a factory environment, instead of the teeming parasite habitat that is knee high paddy fields, are very rarely diagnosed with Schistosoma, which helps outline where exactly the problem emerges from and whether or not if it is effecting drinking water sources.

Henrichsen de Villacis) is an Ecuadorian American fashion designer and artist, best known as for his Trash Couture clothing brand and art collective, United Aliens. Early life De Villacis was born in Quito, Ecuador to American Civil Engineer Robert Henrichsen and Ecuadorian socialite and humanitarian Olga Ortiz de Villacis. He spent his early years between Ecuador, New York City, Florida and the Caribbean. When Roberto was seven, the family relocated to their beach house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida after the death of his father while working on an oil project in Trinidad and Tobago During his senior year at the Pinecrest Prep School, he won a scholarship for the Pratt Institute. After attending Pratt's foundation year, de Villacis transferred from Pratt to study fashion design at Studio Berçot in Paris where he was mentored by Madame Marie Rucki. After graduating in 1991, he remained in Paris where he created his first collection. Early career His first collection was featured in Spanish Vogue, styled by Lisa Lovatt-Smith and Flavia Lafer, photographed by Karl Lagerfeld. Shortly thereafter, Roberto was introduced to Stuart Kriesler, formally of Ralph Lauren, through a mutual friend, Temple St. Clair in New York. Kriesler presented Roberto to Saks Fifth Avenue who purchased his collection at age 24. After a quick success, Roberto found he was unprepared to meet the demand for his product. He decided to take a sabbatical from Fashion and started focusing on his other artistic talents. He began working on light sculptures, which were a part of the \\"L'Art de la Table\\" and are now part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Decorative Arts at the Louvre in Paris. In 1995, de Villacis worked as a head designer for the launch of Anna Molinari's signature label. In 1996 Roberto joined Missoni's creative team as their Men's Designer for the re-launch of their brand.http://www.jcreport.com/intelligence/trash-couture/050104/trash-couture He stayed with Missoni until 2000. He then consulted as an Art Director for Lancôme, creating the slogan \\"Believe in Beauty\\" and the \\"Poetry of Science\\" for Kerastase L’Oreal. In 2002 he founded Trash-Couture/Future Vintage London/Paris. Recent In 2007 Roberto moved back to America after 20 years in Europe. Now based in Los Angeles, CA and Bal Harbour, FL, his focus shifted to Haute Couture for the Arts, catering to artists, aristocrats and an A-list clientele. American Idol and Grammy award winner Carrie Underwood selected Roberto to create the dress for the album cover Carnival Ride which went to become number one in America. His collaboration extended to designing the red carpet dress, a disintegrated ballgown top worn with jeans for the Pop idol show and an evening dress for the music video of the Disney film Enchanted. His designs have been photographed by Helmut Newton, Ellen Von Unwerth, Steven Meisel and featured in Vanity Fair, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, W, and Elle.http://www.bravotv.com/launch-my-line/launch-lineup Mega-stars including Penélope Cruz and Kirsten Dunst to super-models Kate Moss and Verushkahttp://www.trash-couture.com/relaunch/PDF/trash-couture_reviews.pdf showcased his original designs from red carpet premieres, press photos to charity events.

For this reason, it is officially archived only as “the house at number 18, 5 de Febrero Street.” However, the house remains popularly known as the House of the Marquis of Uluapa. The facade has two levels with a mezzanine which was fairly common for houses built in the 18th century. The mezzanine usually served as offices for the house’s owner and contained its own separate entrance. The entrance of the mezzanine had large booths. The flat areas of the facade are more simply decorated but there are gargoyles. The main entrance is decorated with sculpted plants, chain links, volutes, mollusk shells and small grotesque masks. The patio arches have pyramidal decorations. However, it is what is inside the house that is its most distinguishing feature. Inside, on the second floor, are tile murals made in Mexico City with life-sized images of servants such as butlers, washwomen, and cobblers. Murals of this type usually were designed with religious imagery. The house is not open to the public.

Royal Air Force Service Thalbitzer learnt to fly and qualified for a private pilots licence at the age of eighteen. Following the German invasion of Denmark in April 1940, Thalbitzer escaped to England; he left Denmark on 26 December 1940 and travelled via Istanbul, Cyprus, Suez and Cape Town. He was accompanied by Sigfred Johannes Christophersen, who was later to become a British agent in Denmark before being killed in 1943. He was commissioned into the Royal Air Force on 28 October 1941 as a Pilot Officer and trained to fly Hurricanes. He first served with 32 Squadron, before being re-trained to fly Spitfires and joining 234 Squadron at Tangmere. During 1941 and 1942 a group of Danish businessmen living in England collected £38,000 among themselves. This sum was used to purchase three Spitfires. The money was handed over to Winston Churchill by a group of Danish pilots, including Thalbitzer, on 9 April 1942. One of the aircraft bought with the money, serial BL855 (named Niels Ebbesen), was later flown by Thalbitzer. Prisoner of War and Escape On 23 July 1942, while flying Spitfire AB864, Thalbitzer was shot down during a 'Rhubarb' mission to Lannion and crashed into high tension wires near Plouescat.'RAF Fighter Command Losses Vol 2' by Norman Franks page 47 He evaded capture for around 14 days, before being caught and becoming a prisoner of war (POW). He used the assumed name of 'John Thompson' to hide his real identity from the Germans, to help protect his family who were still living in occupied Denmark.'Under the Wire' by William Ash page 224 He was initially sent to Stalag Luft III where he became involved with the escape organisation headed by Lieutenant Commander Jimmy Buckley. In November 1942 he was sent with Buckley, to Oflag XXI-B in Poland. An escape tunnel had been constructed at Oflag XXI-B, aided by Thalbitzer; it was used for a mass escape on 5 March 1943. Thalbitzer escaped with Buckley, together they first travelled to Stettin hoping to find a Danish or Swedish ship which might be able to take them to neutral Sweden. However they were unable to locate any suitable ships, and after narrowly avoiding recapture, they 'jumped' onto a train bound for Rostock. Here they also found no suitable ships.'Under the Wire' by William Ash page 242 From Rostock they decided to head for Copenhagen and reached the city after passing through numerous identity checks using forged papers created in the POW camp. In Copenhagen, Thalbitzer contacted his father, Billy, and through the Danish underground forces, it was arranged for Thalbitzer and Buckley to make the crossing to Sweden using a canoe.'Under the Wire' by William Ash page 243 They departed the Danish coast at 10pm on 28 March 1943, but were never seen alive again. Thalbitzer's body was later recovered, but Buckley's was never found.'The Great Escape' by Paul Brickhill page 19 Thalbitzer was initially buried on 7 July 1943 at Tibirke churchyard, however after his body was identified, by means of his ring with the family coat-of-arms, his urn was interred on 31 July 1943 at Vestre Cemetery.

The treatise, which was then published as a book, puts forward the view that Jesus survived crucifixion, left Judea and migrated eastward in order to continue his mission to the 'Lost Tribes of Israel', traveling through Persia and Afghanistan and eventually dying a natural and honourable death in Kashmir at an old age.J. Gordon Melton The Encyclopedia of Religious Phenomena 2007 p377 Ghulam Ahmad applied textual analysis of both the Gospels and Islamic sources – the Quran and hadith – and also drew upon medical and historical material, including what he claimed were ancient Buddhist records, to argue his case. Modern scholars such as Norbert Klatt (1988) have rejected Ghulam Ahmad's use of these latter sources as misreadings of material unrelated to Jesus.Klatt, Lebte Jesus in Indien? Göttingen : Wallstein-Verlag, 1988 Background The book was completed in 1899 and was partly serialised in the Review of Religions in 1902-1903. It was published in book form shortly after Ghulam Ahmad’s death in 1908.The publisher's note (page v) at the beginning of the book states: \\"Written in 1899, and partly serialized in Review of Religions in 1902 and 1903, the book itself was posthumously published on 20th November 1908.\\" Jesus in India by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1 July 2003) The first complete English translation was published in 1944. Content of the book The treatise suggests that Jesus, having survived crucifixion, discreetly left Roman jurisdiction for the East, starting his journey from Jerusalem and passing through Nisibis and Persia, eventually reaching Afghanistan where he met the Israelite tribes who had settled there after their escape from the bonds of Nebuchadnezzar centuries before. From here he travelled to Kashmir where some Israelite tribes had also settled and lived there until his death at an old age. Other authors have suggested that the resemblance between Buddhist and Christian teachings and between the lives of Jesus and Buddha as recorded in their respective scriptures indicate that Buddhist teachings must have reached Palestine been incorporated by Jesus into his own teaching, or that he must have travelled to India pre-crucifixion. Ghulam Ahmad, however, asserts that Jesus reached India only after the crucifixion and that Buddhists later reproduced elements of the Gospels in their scriptures. He argues that Jesus also preached to Buddhist monks, some of whom were originally Jews, who accepted him as a manifestation of the Buddha, the 'promised teacher', and mingled his teachings with Buddha’s. Jesus in India also contains claims on the whereabouts of the Lost Tribes of Israel, suggesting that these tribes were scattered throughout Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Western China.http://www.alislam.org/sunrise/sunrise2003-4.pdf It also provides a list of tribes of these regions seeking to trace their Israelite roots. Alleged discovery Ahmadiyya literature states that one of Ghulam Ahmad’s disciples, Khalifa Nur Din (or Noor al-Din) of Jalalpur Jattan, District Gujrat, Pakistan spoke to him about a tomb in Srinagar that was said to be the tomb of a prophet named Yuz Asaf. Ghulam Ahmad instructed him to do some further research into the matter. Nur Din went to Srinagar and stayed there for about four months. He collected information and also obtained the signatures of 556 inhabitants who attested that, according to their traditions, the remains of Jesus Christ lay in the Roza Bal. He also brought back a sketch of the Roza Bal. Thereafter, Ghulam Ahmad decided to send one of his followers, Maulvi Abdullah, to Kashmir to investigate this tomb. Maulvi Abdullah arrived in Kashmir, conducted his investigations, and wrote back to Ghulam Ahmad about his findings. Ghulam Ahmad then published a poster that contained Maulvi Abdullah’s letter, as well as Maulvi Abdullah’s sketch of the Roza Bal. Ghulam Ahmad began studying the local traditions of the people of Kashmir, both oral and written, and discovered that these traditions, as mentioned in the letter from Maulvi Abdullah, referred to the Roza Bal as the tomb of Nabi Isa (Prophet Jesus). According to this information, the Muslims in that locality did not believe Jesus to be in heaven, as was taught by the orthodox clergy. The Ahmadiyya publication, Review of Religions, recorded this belief in its October, 1909 edition. Modern reception The claims of the book regarding a journey of Jesus to India are rejected or ignored by most scholars. The documents used by Ahmad were reviewed by the German indologist Günter Grönbold in Jesus in Indien. Das Ende einer Legende (Munich, 1985), with Grönbold concluding that Ahmad had misidentified material from the Barlaam and Josaphat texts relating to a Christianized version of the life of Siddhartha Gautama, not of Jesus.Historia animae utilis de Barlaam et Ioasaph (spuria): Einführung 2009 3110210991 \\"...Jahrhunderts, in dem auf die Barlaam-Parabel vom König und seinem weisen Ratgeber (Kitāb Bilawhar wa Būdāsf, übers. ...

It was based on the 1978 play of the same name by Wallace Shawn, who also wrote the script with Cairns, and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2004. Although the film was well received and starred many major motion picture stars, it failed to receive distribution and remained obscure, until it was released on DVD in March 2009. The music was done by Mark Degli Antoni, of the band Soul Coughing. Synopsis The story focuses on the somewhat whimsical and comical relationship between a fairly unlikely couple involved in a complex and emotionally tortured cohabitation. The real scandal begins when Marie decides to leave Bruce. Her lack of measured decisiveness in leaving, however, leads to the heaping on of verbal invective and a stream of sarcastic and pejorative language, assumed to have accumulated over the years. At the climactic dinner scene at a restaurant, Marie finally expresses her verbal contempt for Bruce but without much effect. The two discuss their future together when Bruce surprises Marie with a gift he bought for the house.

Kenneth Anthony Angell (August 3, 1930 - October 4, 2016) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Burlington from 1992 to 2005. Biography One of three children, Kenneth Angell was born in Providence, Rhode Island, to Henry and Mae (née Cooney) Angell. After attending public elementary schools in East Providence, he studied at Our Lady of Providence Seminary in Warwick and at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. Angell was ordained to the priesthood on May 26, 1957. He then served as parochial vicar at St. Mark Church in Jamestown and at Sacred Heart ChurchSacred Heart Church in Pawtucket. After serving at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Angell then received his first pastorate at St. John's Church in Providence. From 1968 to 1972, he was assistant chancellor of the Diocese of Providence and secretary to Bishop Russell McVinney. He served as chancellor under Bishop Louis Edward Gelineau from 1972 to 1974 and was raised to the rank of Monsignor in December 1972. He became vicar general of the diocese in August 1974. On August 9, 1974, Angell was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Providence and Titular Bishop of Septimunicia by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 7 from Bishop Gelineau, with Archbishop John Francis Whealon and Bishop John Francis Hackett serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul. After nearly 20 years as an auxiliary in Providence, Angell was named the eighth Bishop of Burlington, Vermont, by Pope John Paul II on October 6, 1992. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on November 9, 1992. Faced with a shortage of priests in Burlington, and a decline in weekly Mass attendance, Angell consolidated Sacred HeartSacred Heart and St. Francis de SalesSt. Francis de Sales parishes in Bennington as well as St. Cecilia and St. Frances Cabrini in East Barre, and closed Our Lady of the Lake in St. Albans. A strong opponent of same-sex marriage, he unsuccessfully campaigned against H.B. 847, which granted civil unions to same-sex couples with the same rights and privileges accorded to married couples in 2000. Speaking to the Vermont House of Representatives, he said, \\"Do not let the court or anybody else push you around. You have no duty, moral or constitutional, to weaken the institution of marriage. If the court thinks otherwise, then let the people overrule the court. This is the United States of America. We are not ruled by kings, whether on a throne or in the courtroom.\\" In 2001 he wrote to the House to express his opposition to capital punishment, saying, \\"We must not perpetuate the crime of murder by becoming a society that kills for retribution.... We must not promote or justify a culture of vengeance. We cannot hope to teach that killing is wrong by killing.\\" His younger brother David Angell, the Emmy Award-winning creator and producer of Frasier, and his wife Lynn died during the September 11 attacks aboard American Airlines Flight 11. Angell later said, \\"Our family was devastated, and yet in times of such crisis you get strength that's rather incredible. You don't really know where it comes from. It comes ultimately from God, but it comes through many people who are supportive. It comes from one's faith and the belief that the Lord takes care of us, and that his will must be done.\\" In response to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Angell said, \\"Our hopes of avoiding war were quashed today, but our prayers for peace will not end until this war does.... We pray for the safety and deliverance of the innocent citizens in Iraq, that they be protected from harm and freed from oppression. We pray their terror will be of short duration and that their rewards will be a new country based on freedom and democratic principles, supported by a united international community.\\" Angell received Salvatore Ronald Matano as his coadjutor bishop in April 2005. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, he submitted his letter of resignation to Pope Benedict XVI in August 2005. His resignation was accepted on November 9. Angell died on October 4, 2016, from a stroke.'Former Burlington bishop dies,' Burlington Free Press, Cory Dawson, October 5, 2016 Sexual abuse scandals Angell has been criticized for his management of sexual abuse allegations during his tenure as auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Providence, which experienced the longest legal battle over such allegations in the nation and later announced a $13.5 million settlement in 36 different lawsuits in 2002. In 1989 he promised to \\"take care of it\\" when the Providence priest Normand Demers was arrested and jailed for misconduct with boys while working at The Haitian Project; Demers was later brought back to work in the diocese. Angell testified in a 1990 lawsuit that he did not take allegations against another priest, Rev. William O'Connell, seriously. O'Connell was later convicted and served a short sentence before moving to New Jersey, where he committed more crimes and died in prison. During his tenure as bishop in Burlington, records show Angell allowed six accused priests to remain in active ministry within Vermont. He refused to identify them publicly, but then gave their names to the State Attorney General and placed them under suspension. At a news conference in March 2005, Angell described the sexual abuse scandals as the most difficult challenge he faced during his time as bishop. He said, \\"People have been so shocked by all of this and it's a wonderful compliment to us really, in the sense that they expect so much more of us than anyone else and we shouldn't fail them. It's been very difficult and difficult for these priests too [who] have been in trouble. The victims first and foremost have my concern. After that I think of the priests how because of one, one little lapse or something, something terrible happened. I can't help but feel sorry for them. I decry what they did.\\" References  External links  *Official site of the Holy See Category:1930 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Catholics from Rhode Island Category:Clergy from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Burlington Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:21st-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Religious leaders from Rhode Island ","title":"Kenneth Angell"},{"id":"24048210","text":"Mozier Landing is an unincorporated community in Calhoun County, Illinois, United States.

Note that the atoms often block each other from moving to adjacent sites. As per Fick’s law, the net flux (or movement of atoms) is always in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient. H+ ions diffusing in an O2- lattice of superionic ice Lattice diffusion (also called bulk or volume diffusion) refers to atomic diffusion within a crystalline lattice.P. Heitjans, J. Karger, Ed, “Diffusion in condensed matter: Methods, Materials, Models,” 2nd edition, Birkhauser, 2005, pp. 1-965. Diffusion within the crystal lattice occurs by either interstitial or substitutional mechanisms and is referred to as lattice diffusion. In interstitial lattice diffusion, a diffusant (such as C in an iron alloy), will diffuse in between the lattice structure of another crystalline element. In substitutional lattice diffusion (self-diffusion for example), the atom can only move by substituting place with another atom. Substitutional lattice diffusion is often contingent upon the availability of point vacancies throughout the crystal lattice. Diffusing particles migrate from point vacancy to point vacancy by the rapid, essentially random jumping about (jump diffusion). Since the prevalence of point vacancies increases in accordance with the Arrhenius equation, the rate of crystal solid state diffusion increases with temperature. For a single atom in a defect-free crystal, the movement can be described by the \\"random walk\\" model.

It was granted a monopoly to trade with Spain's South American colonies as part of a treaty during the War of Spanish Succession, in return for the company's assumption of the national debt run up by England during the war. Speculation in the company's stock led to a great economic bubble in 1720, with company's shares rising rapidly in price from around £100 to over £1,000. Many investors were ruined when the bubble burst and the value of stock in the South Sea Company crashed. Political scandal ensued when fraud among the company's directors and corruption of cabinet ministers became clear. The event triggered several satirical engravings by foreign artists that were widely published in English newspapers, including in particular a version of A Monument Dedicated to Posterity by Bernard Picart adapted by Bernard Baron,Baron would later engrave portraits by Hogarth, some of the plates of Marriage à-la-mode, and Evening, one of Hogarth's 1736 Four Times of the Day series which depicted Folly drawing Fortune in a cart while she showered a crowd of hopeful investors with bubbles of air and worthless shreds of paper rather than with the riches for which they hoped. Hogarth's print was created in 1721 as a response to the foreign engravings. The events had personal piquancy for Hogarth, given his father's detention as a debtor in Fleet Prison from 1707–12 and his early death in 1718. The South Sea Scheme is an early essay in engraving by Hogarth, who had set up on his own as a copperplate artist and painter after his apprenticeship with silver engraver Ellis Gamble came to an early end in 1720. Description The print shows a London scene, with the Guildhall and its monumental statue of the giant Gog (or Magog) to the left, a classical column based on The Monument to the Great Fire of London to the right, and the dome of St Paul's Cathedral rising behind the buildings in the background. The base of the column bears an inscription which states: \\"This monument was erected in memory of the destruction of the city by the South Sea in 1720\\", while foxes fight above.The Monument can be seen rendered more faithfully in the rear of plate 6 of Industry and Idleness, with its original inscription commemorating the Great Fire and dragons in place of the foxes. It is no coincidence that in Hogarth's scene the monument, a symbol of the City's greed, dwarfs St Paul's, a symbol of Christian charity. Plate 11: \\"La pendaison\\" (The Hanging), from The Miseries and Misfortunes of War Plate 6 of Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress The centre of the print is occupied by a financial wheel of fortune or merry-go-round ridden by figures representative of the broad section of society taken in by the scheme, including a whore and a clergyman on the left,This composition is mirrored in plate 6 of A Harlot's Progress. then a boot black and a hag, and a Scottish nobleman to the right, on a fat-faced horse. The ride is surmounted by a goat and the slogan \\"Who'l Ride\\" and surrounded by a jostling crowd below. To the front of the crowd, a short pickpocket rifles through the pockets of a larger gentleman. Paulson identifies the first as a caricature of Alexander Pope, who profited from the South Sea Scheme; and speculates that the other is John Gay, who, refusing to cash in enough of his stock to enable himself to have \\"a clean shirt and a shoulder of mutton every day for life\\", lost his investment and all his imagined profits.Samuel Ireland attributes Pope's lack of response to Hogarth's unflattering image of him here and in other works to \\"his dread of the pencil of our inimitable artist\\". The image of the wheel is a parody of Jacques Callot's La Pendaison from the series The Miseries and Misfortunes of War, and the crowd has elements taken from his La Roue. Women line a balcony to the upper left, queuing to enter a building surmounted by stag's antlers, under a sign which offers \\"Raffleing for Husbands with Lottery Fortunes in Here\\". The satire is accentuated by a series of allegorical figures, identified by letters explained in the verse below. To the left, a blindfolded Fortune hangs by her hair from the balcony of the Guildhall (the devil's shop) while a winged devil cuts off parts of her body with a scythe and throws the bloody chunks into the baying crowd. In the bottom left corner, distinctive clothing identifies a Catholic, a Jew and a Puritan, who are ignoring the tumultuous scene to concentrate on their game of chance. To their right, the naked figure of Honesty is broken on the wheel by Self-interest while an Anglican priest looks on; further right, Villainy – who has removed his fair mask which now hangs upside down between his legs – scourges Honour beneath the column. Standing nearby is a monkey (a symbol of mimicry or \\"aping\\") who wears a gentleman's sword and a baronial hat, and wraps himself in Honour's cloak. In the lower right corner, the figure of Trade lies asleep or dead, ignored by all. Underneath, a verse reads: :{style=\\"font-style:italic; font- size:75%; text-align:left;\\" |See here ye Causes why in London, So many Men are made, & undone, That Arts, & honest Trading drop, To Swarm about ye Devils shop, (A) Who Cuts out (B) Fortunes Golden Haunches, |Trapping their Souls with Lotts and Chances, em from Blue Garters down To all Blue Aprons in the Town. Here all Religions flock together, Like Tame and Wild Fowl of a Feather, |Leaving their strife Religious bustle, Kneel down to play at pitch and Hussle; (C) Thus when the Sheepherds are at play, Their flocks must surely go Astray; The woeful Cause yt in these Times |(E) Honour, & (D) honesty, are Crimes, That publickly are punish'd by (G) Self Interest, and (F) Vilany; So much for monys magick power Guess at the Rest you find out more. |} Hogarth may have tried to sell copies of the print in 1721, but no advertisements for the issue of the print are known. In 1724, following his unsuccessful attempt to break the printmakers' monopoly by self-publishing his popular print The Bad Taste of the Town (also known as Masquerades and Operas), Hogarth sold his South Sea print, and another 1724 engraving entitled The Lottery, through the printsellers Mrs Chilcott in Westminster Hall and R Caldwell in Newgate Street. Prints were sold for 1 shilling each. Various states of the print exist; between the first and second state some minor corrections were made, including a change from \\"And Swarm\\" to \\"To Swarm\\" in the fourth line of the verse, but all other states only change the publication line to reflect a corresponding change in the printseller. The last known state, produced sometime after 1751, has the publication line erased completely. An early sketch, noted in Oppe's catalogue, omits St Paul's, the Guildhall, and various figures on the merry- go-round, shows Honesty as a woman, and has different wording for the inscriptions on the monument and raffle house.  Reception  Ronald Paulson has described Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme as \\"the one original Bubble print by an English artist\\". John J. Richetti, in The Cambridge history of English literature, 1660–1780, states that \\"English graphic satire really begins with Hogarth's Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme\\".Richetti, p. 85 Notes References   * Category:Prints by William Hogarth Category:1721 works ","title":"Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme"},{"id":"24048307","text":"Stanford E. Lehmberg (1931 – June 14, 2012) was an American historian and professor. Early life and schooling Stanford E. Lehmberg was born in McPherson, Kansas on 23 September 1931. Lehmberg's father was a Kansas dealer in farm implements, who spent most of his life also managing a local bank. Lehmberg's mother was a teacher (of Latin) in Kansas public schools before Stanford was born. Lehmberg was a good student in McPherson public schools, and also received training in organ performance during his junior high and high school years. Lehmberg attended the University of Kansas, receiving a BA degree (Humanities) in 1953 and an MA degree (History, specializing in Italian Renaissance) in 1954. After his MA, Lehmberg applied for and received a Fulbright Scholarship to study abroad, which he used at the University of Cambridge. He received a Ph.D. (1956) from Cambridge after completing a dissertation on Sir Thomas Elyot, author of the first Latin-English dictionary to be published in sixteenth-century England. In that effort Lehmberg worked extensively with noted English historian Sir Geoffrey Elton. Teaching career While still in England Lehmberg received a job offer from the University of Texas at Austin. He taught British History at that University from 1956 to 1969. He found that institution's History Library to be almost non-existent in the British History section, and worked tirelessly to increase its size and stature, although during his entire time there the library's budget was quite limited.http://www.conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/49909/1/lehmbergStanford.pdf Interview with Stanford Lehmberg, 1994 When esteemed historian and professor David Harris Willson retired from the University of Minnesota, Lehmberg was invited to move to Minnesota. He taught at UM from 1969 to 1998, twice chairing the History Department, and in 2000 co-authoring a history of the university. Writing career Lehmberg's Ph.D. thesis eventually evolved into his first book, Sir Thomas Elyot, Tudor Humanist (1960). He then wrote a modernized edition of Elyot's book Book Named the Governor (1962). His next book was a history of Sir Walter Mildmay's political career, Sir Walter Mildmay and Tudor Government (1964). Later came The Reformation Parliament, 1529-1536 (1970), with a sequel The Later Parliaments of Henry VIII, 1536-1547 (1977). He wrote a history of English cathedrals The Reformation of Cathedrals: Cathedrals in English Society, 1485-1603 (1988), and a comprehensive period history, The Peoples of the British Isles, from Prehistoric Times to 1688 (1991), and concluded with another study of cathedrals, Cathedral Under Siege: Cathedrals in English Society, 1600-1700 (1996). With another UM professor, he wrote The University of Minnesota, 1945-2000 (2000, co-author with Ann M. Pflaum)http://www.hist.umn.edu/people/lehmberg.php University of Minnesota Faculty spotlight website, accessed 19 August 2009 Lehmberg has written many articles, some of which are listed here: *Archbishop Grindal and the Prophesyings, Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church (1965) *Early Tudor Parliamentary Procedure: Provisos in the Legislation of the Reformation Parliament, E.H.R.

He planned on using his Fulbright Scholarship to study the history of the Italian Renaissance, but did not receive approval to study in Italy because he had not bothered to learn sufficient Italian. Therefore, he ended up in London, and while there he took organ lessons on the side, while pursuing a Ph.D. degree (a normal three-year course that he managed to complete in two years). He studied with eminent British organist Sir Boris Ord. Lehmberg worked with choirs and church musical groups both at Austin and St. Paul. He served on the board of Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and on the board of Concentus Musicus (which performed antique music on period instruments) until its demise. For 28 years he was organist and choir director of St. Clement's Episcopal Church in St. Paul, Minnesota. He twice led the University's search for new heads of the university's Department of Music. Personal life When Lehmberg arrived in Austin for his first teaching job, a graduate student in one of his classes was majoring in Library Science, specializing in rare-books librarianship. He began dating her, and soon they were married (Phyllis). She was a native Texan, and resisted the 1969 move to Minnesota, but eventually became very happy there.

It is expected to cost A$250 million to construct. The wind farm is envisioned to have 60 wind turbines in Stage 1. The total generation capacity for Stage 1 would be 138 MW. This would be enough electricity generation to power the entire Cape York Peninsula while supplementing the electricity needs of Port Douglas and Cairns. Archer Point is recognised as one of the windiest places in Queensland. The project would generate about 400,000 MW-hr of electricity - enough electricity to power over 75,000 average Queensland homes. In addition, the wind farm would make a very significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Queensland - reducing electricity emissions by over 370,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually. This would be equivalent to taking 85,000 cars off the road. Once constructed, the wind farm would have twice the capacity of the largest renewable energy generation facility in Queensland. Towers are expected to be 80 m high. In May 2011, it was announced that a lease agreement between the traditional land owners and National Power has been reached.

It received members from parties ranging as wide as from the Red Electoral Alliance to the Progress Party. The action was originally headed by Vidar Karlstad, but was immediately also supported by Anders John Aune, a former Member of Parliament for the Labour Party.

Among the issues for the party was a reduction of taxes in order to improve the conditions of the county which was haunted by poor fishing outputs and people moving out. After Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland had visited the county the previous year, Karlstad stated that \\"it is incomprehensible for us that the Prime Minister of the country travels all over the world teaching other nations on how to govern themselves, while our county lay as a forgotten colony which people escape from\\".

Donau was known for his often temperamental and difficult personality, which led to him being gelded at the end of 1910. Donau started in 111 races over his three-year flat racing career and was in the process of being retrained for steeplechasing when he died at the age of six years in February 1913 at the Nashville farm of his owner William Gerst of the William Gerst Brewing Company. Background Origins and parentage Donau was bred by Colonel Milton Young, who owned Donau's sire.Daily Racing Form. May 1, 1954 At the time of Donau's birth, Col. Young and Thomas Piatt had a racing partnership. Piatt owned Brookdale Farm in Kentucky, a Thoroughbred stud farm located on Greendale Pike approximately seven miles northwest of Lexington, where Donau was foaled in 1907. Donau's full-brother Wooltex being ridden by his owner George S. Patton in 1914. Donau's sire Woolsthorpe was imported from Britain by Col. Young and his racing partner Charles F. McMeekin (or according to another source Eugene Leigh) in the summer of 1900. Woolsthorpe raced for 10 seasons, from 1890 to 1899 in Britain, winning nine races out of 63 starts for his breeder Prince Peter Soltykoff. Woolsthorpe was the sire of over 200 racing winners before his death at the age of 22 at the Lexington farm of John D. Carr on July 15, 1910, about a month after Donau won the Kentucky Derby. Donau's dam, Al Lone, was bred by H. B. Douglas and was foaled in Fayetteville, Tennessee in 1894. Al Lone was a semi-successful selling-plater with sixteen minor racing wins to her credit in 128 starts that was purchased by Thomas Piatt after her racing career ended in 1903. Al Lone produced Donau's full-brother, Wooltex, in 1909 at Brookdale Farm. Wooltex was later gelded and was a successful steeplechaser in the 1910s. Wooltex was bought by George S. Patton for $2,100 in 1912 and from Patton's personal correspondence, the gelding had a nervous and flighty personality similar to his older brother Donau. Personality and attributes According to Thomas Piatt, Donau had a fiery temper as a yearling, repeatedly kicking any other colt that would come near him. Piatt typically reared his yearlings in group pens, but Donau's fractious behavior led Piatt to separate him from other horses. Piatt raised Donau at Brookdale Farm until September 1908, when he was sold to William Gerst for $350. Gerst emigrated to the United States from Germany as a child and was the co-founder of the Gerst Brewing Company in Nashville, Tennessee. William Gerst named the colt Donau after the Danube River. William Gerst remarked on Donau's qualities and personality, \\"[he] has the speed of a sprinter, the courage of a bulldog, and the gameness of a fighting cock.\\" Fred Herbert, Donau's jockey in the Derby, said of the often temperamental horse, \\"he likes to be in company and don't fret a bit when he comes on the track with another horse, while just alone he is a bit nervous.\\" Racing career 1909: two-year-old season Donau spent much of his early racing career in California. Donau started 41 times as a two-year-old, which was considered excessive by many horsemen, even at a time when racehorses were normally raced hard at a very young age. Donau's first major stakes win was the 1909 Wakefield Stakes, run at the Empire City Race Track in Yonkers, where he also started in three other races over a period of eight days. After winning the Wakefield Stakes on July 22, trainer James Blute decided the colt needed to be rested. It was thought he would return for September's Flatbush Stakes which the Daily Racing Form said was a race which could determine that year's two-year-old champion. Donau did not compete and the race was won by Waldo who would receive 1909 Co- Championship honors with Sweep. Trainer James Blute would be replaced by the owners for the 1910 racing season. 1910: three-year-old season Ridden by Canadian-born jockey Fred Herbert, Donau won the 1910 Kentucky Derby in a close finish over Joe Morris at a time of 2:06 2/5 on a fast track, winning a total of $4,850 for Gerst.Donau Racing Stats and Pedigree William Gerst had previously achieved a second-place finish in the 1907 Derby with his colt Zal and a third-place finish in the 1904 Derby with Brancas. Donau's trainer, George Ham, remarked on the colt's Derby win \\"The colt performed in a most remarkable manner and showed that he could go over a distance of ground, even though hard pressed by game opponents.\\" After the Derby win, Donau's unruly behavior worsened to a point where he would lie down on the track if prompted too harshly by racetrack employees or trainers. In September 1910, Gerst temporarily retired Donau to his farm in Nashville with commentary in the Daily Racing Form suggesting that the break from racing was due to Donau being a \\"track demon\\" with a \\"disposition to do nothing asked of him.\\" Donau was gelded at the end of his three-year-old season in an attempt to curb his behavior, but he was still fractious. However, in March 1912 he won the South Carolina Selling Stakes at Palmetto Park in Charleston, South Carolina. Donau was retired from flat racing in December 1912, at age five. Retirement and death Donau was in the process of being re-trained for steeplechasing when he died suddenly in February 1913 during an epidemic that killed three and sickened 18 other horses at the Nashville farm of William Gerst.

It was introduced by Jolson and interpolated in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo. Jolson's recording rose to number two on the charts in 1921. The song was possibly written by Rose, but Jolson's popularity as a performer allowed him to claim composer co-credit. Originally, only Rose and Jolson were credited, and DeSylva's name was added later. A popular jazz standard, the song has been recorded by many artists, including Cab Calloway (1934), Coleman Hawkins (1935) and Eddie Durham (1936). The Benny Goodman Quartet played the song in their famous 1938 Carnegie Hall concert. The tune remains popular in the gypsy jazz repertoire, having been performed by Wawau Adler and others. The tune's opening melody resembles a part of Giacomo Puccini's aria E lucevan le stelle, from the opera Tosca, but in the major key. Puccini's publishers sued the song's composers in 1921 for use of the melody, and were awarded $25,000 and all subsequent royalties of the song by the court. Film appearances The song was included in the biographical films The Jolson Story (1946) and The Benny Goodman Story (1956), and is also being noodled by Sam (Dooley Wilson) at the piano right before he plays \\"As Time Goes By\\" in the movie Casablanca (1942). The song was played in the background in the 1932 movie You Said a Mouthful which starred Joe E. Brown.

It is playing in the background in the party scene about 35 minutes into the film, where George Bailey's mother urges George to pay a visit to Mary Hatch. The song is played during the opening credits of Peter Bogdanovich's The Cat's Meow (2001), a film about an ill-fated 1924 voyage along the California coast aboard a yacht belonging to William Randolph Hearst.

Shachaf has spoken at scientific conferences and has published more than 17 journal articles. Her leading work was published in Nature (2004), \\"MYC Inactivation Uncovers Pluripotent Differentiation and Tumor Dormancy in Hepatocellular Cancer.\\" Shachaf is on the Editorial Board of the International Journal of Green Nanotechnology.

Weiland Fellowship, CCIS, Stanford University (2001–2004) Key scientific contributions Shachaf has researched how MYC expression induces cancer in mice and the effect of its inactivation in those tumors. She showed that removing MYC expression kills the tumor and that MYC reprograms the tumor cells. When MYC expression is taken away from the tumor cells, they are released to their inherent embryonic program.Shachaf CM. and Felsher D. W. Rehabilitation of cancer through oncogene inactivation.

The appearance of the tissue formed in this process looks normal by histology (a method used by pathologists to determine the presence of cancer cells). However, Shachaf showed that the cells derived from the tumor are \\"camouflaged\\" to appear normal but have the capability to easily revert and become tumors.Shachaf CM. and Felsher D. W.

Systematic molecular analysis of a MYC overexpressing tumor cell following MYC inactivation. Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 1;68(13):5132-42. The MYC protein in cancers correlates with poor prognosis and is a difficult therapeutic target. To find alternative downstream targets of MYC, Shachaf defined levels of MYC expression required to drive tumorigenic properties. She conducted a systematic genomic and proteomic profile of MYC dependent tumor cells using microarray analysis, mass spectrometry, cell- antibody arrays and phospho-flow (a flow cytometry based approach to study phosphorylation events in single cells). As a member of the Stanford NCI funded Integrated Cancer Biology Program (ICBP), Shachaf and her colleagues developed a computational program of the genes and gene programs that are required to maintain cancers at different stages of aggressiveness. Using this program, Shachaf and her team found the gene silencing and apoptotic programs to be most significant in inducing tumor cell death. With preventative treatment of tumor-prone mice prior to developing tumors, Shachaf showed that it is possible to block tumor development. This was achieved with a commonly used cholesterol lowering statin drug. The statin inhibited signaling pathways required for the tumor generating activities of the MYC oncogene. This study is an important demonstration in the efficacy of targeting tumors prior to onset. Shachaf also leads the development of the use of Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy nanoparticles for the detection of signaling events in single cancer cells. RamanSpectroscopy relies on inelastic scattering, or Raman scattering, of monochromatic light, usually from a laser. Photons of the laser light are absorbed by the nanoparticles and then reemitted. The frequency of the reemitted photons is shifted up or down in comparison with original monochromatic frequency, called Raman scattering. Spontaneous Raman scattering is typically very weak. However, the Composite Organic-Inorganic Nanoparticles (COINs) used by Shachaf have enhanced Raman spectra. Each particle has a different Raman tag generating a unique fingerprint Raman spectra. This approach has tremendous advantages over the commonly used fluorescence tags. Fluorescence has broad overlapping spectra making the use of multiple tags simultaneously difficult. On the other hand, COINs have narrow peak spectra and therefore are more useful for multiple tag use.

Life Gualterio was born in Fermo. Descended from the ancient family Gualterio of Orvieto related to Pope Innocent X, he was grand-nephew of Cardinal Carlo Gualterio and uncle of Cardinal Luigi Gualterio. Born at Fermo, whose archdiocese was governed by his grand-uncle Carlo, he was the eldest of 17 children of Stanislao Gualterio, Gonfaloniere of Orvieto, and Anna Maria Cioli, noble of Todi.Biographical information from Salvador Miranda, \\"Cardinals of the Holy Roman church\\". He received doctorates at the University of Fermo in philosophy, theology, and utroque iure, both canon and civil law. Beginning in 1685, when he was made Governor of San Severino, he served in various governorates of the Papal States until he was sent as Vice-legate to Avignon (1696–1700), where he carried himself so well he was made papal nuncio to the court of King Louis XIV of France in April 1700, in preparation for which he was made titular archbishop of Atena at the end of March. On 16 May 1700, he was consecrated bishop by François de Mailly, Archbishop of Arles. Another member of his family, Sebastiano Gualterio, had already served as nuncio to France in 1554. He was made Commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit. He was recalled to Rome to be created cardinal in the consistory of 17 May 1706 and sent as legate to Romagna, 25 June. During his nunciature he established ties with prominent members of the European nobility and, in particular, with the Duc of Saint-Simon, who often mentions him in the Memoirs. In recognition of the esteem he gained from King Louis XIV, he was named the commendatory abbot of the Abbey of Saint-Remy in Rheims (1710) and of the Abbey of Saint-Victor in Paris (1713 or 1714). Gualterio was nominated Cardinal Protector of Scotland, as of 1706, and England, as of 1717, he was one of the closest advisers to the Stuart Pretender, James Stuart, the would- be James III of England,Edward T.

Between 1713 and 1720 he also retained the title of Duke of Cumia (created by King Philip V of Spain) In 1709 Gualterio was transferred to the Diocese of Todi, with the personal title of archbishop, later resigning the see in favour of his brother, Ludovico Anselmo Gualterio, 5 December 1714. He participated in the Papal conclave, 1721, which elected Pope Innocent XIII and in the conclave of 1724, which elected Pope Benedict XIII. Founder of a monumental library, now part of the Accademia dei Lincei, and of a vast collection of art, which after his death was partly acquired by Hans Sloane and is now at the British Museum, Gualterio was elected an honorary member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1715).

The film revolves around an emotionally backward young woman who lives in a castle in Italy with her mother and her aggressive father, along with a dark secret hidden within the castle. Plot The film begins with Naomi Arkoff (Robin Sydney) being taken by her father Carver Arkoff (Steve Kramer) into the basement of their castle home in Rome, Italy, where there lies a rack. Carver ties Naomi to both ends of the rack and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment this time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her that the next time she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment is not going to be slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: \\"I can run faster than you!\\" over and over again. The next afternoon, Carver comes downstairs into the dining room to be questioned by his wife Lisbeth (Samantha Light) about what he did to Naomi the previous night. They then encourage Carver's half brother Peter (Giacomo Gonnella), who is mentally retarded, to have lunch with them, where Carver tells Peter that the lamb that they're eating was Sophia, who Peter had grown an affection with. When Naomi comes downstairs and finds out what's up, she gives her toy animal of a horse to him, which appears to cheer him up. Later, Lisbeth takes a tray of food upstairs to her father, who throughout the entire film has his face not seen. Lisbeth then continues to read Edgar Allan Poe's \\"From Childhood's Hour\\" to him. Afterward, she alerts him that his guardian angels are in the room to protect him, which are shown to be small little creatures with big skull heads. Lisbeth then goes to check on Naomi and Naomi tells her that she wants to go away to college because she wants to be able to get out and meet people and do exciting things. Lisbeth, however, tells her the story of Naomi's grandmother, who ran away when Lisbeth was a baby to go see the circus and never came back. When Lisbeth then became a teenager, the circus came back into town and when she went to see it, she saw her mom in the circus act performing acrobatics on a wire. The moral is, that if Naomi leaves, she might never come back to see her father and mother just like her grandmother did. Lisbeth suddenly finds an iPod underneath Naomi's pillow. But after finding out how useful it can be, she allows Naomi to keep it unless she doesn't have her father see it. The next morning, Claudia (Lucia Stara), the Arkoffs' maid, opens the two double doors that lead outside of the castle to be greeted by three people: Kimi (Kim Argetsinger), L.J. (Antonio Covatta) and Jensen (Rane Jameson), who claim that they are Hollywood Producers looking for a place to shoot a couple scenes for a spy/war movie they're doing. Before shutting the door in their faces, Naomi quickly invites them in so she can finally meet new people, but the opportunity is ruined when Carver comes outside and insults the trio, forcing them to leave, not before Kimi hands Carver her card in case anyone changes their mind. Carver then tears up the card, and throws it down, telling Uncle Peter to escort the trio out. Meanwhile, Naomi gathers up the card. Later on that day, Naomi sneaks a cell phone away from one of the water delivery boys and calls the number on the card so they can come over for dinner that night. That night, after finally calming her father down about having guests over, everyone finally settles down for a lovely meal until they hear something. The family explains that it's the \\"protectors\\" A.K.A.: Grandpa's Guardian Angels. Lisbeth explains that the Romans used to bury the dead in catacombs, and it is believed that a couple of tombs are buried beneath the castle. Back when the Ostrogoths and the Vandals sacked Rome, they violated the catacombs searching for valuables, hence why the castle was constructed above the burial grounds. The so-called \\"Protectors\\" in the castle are called Skull Heads, creatures born from witchcraft that were placed in the castle to protect the dead from any such type of violation for the past 200 years. it's also believed that they have the power to have control on the living and the dead. After the grand tour of the castle, the film crew leave and it's revealed that they're not really Hollywood filmmakers, but really art thieves, and after viewing the castle, they plan on robbing the place the next night. The next morning, Carver tells Naomi that the breakfast that she has just received is the only thing she's eating because she's going to be put back on the rack later on. As he heads downstairs, he finds Peter trying to stick his penis in Claudia's crack. He quickly beats Peter out of the room, but then forces Claudia to keep her pants down as he unzips his pants zipper. Later that night, Kimi, L.J. and Jensen sneak into the house and start stealing items. Meanwhile, Jensen finds Naomi tied up on the rack in the basement and just as they're about to escape, they run into Carver and Lisbeth. As they fight between the right decision for Naomi, Lisbeth explains why the family always sticks together and why they act strange (especially Naomi): Naomi is not only Carver and Lisbeth's daughter, but she's their niece and Carver and Lisbeth are not really husband and wife, they're really brother and sister. The reason Naomi is a little bit retarded is because of being an inbred and confused about who she really is. Suddenly, Lisbeth gets shot in the back and Carver, at the same time, gets shot in the chest by Kimi, who then forces Jensen and Naomi back into the basement.Skull Heads Movie, New Releases Films Kimi tricks Naomi into tying Jensen to the rack, for betraying his partner. Kimi then presses an button, which causes the rack to run automatically instead of manually. Kimi then locks Naomi in a trap where she can't move and continues to find L.J., who had just been knocked out by Peter. L.J. and Kimi then continue to grab the rest of the stuff they wanted. Meanwhile, the Skull Heads find the bodies of Carver and Lisbeth and with their power, they bring them back alive as zombies and have them go after the thieves. Carver and Lisbeth corner L.J. and Kimi at the castle's doors and they start eating off their faces, spraying blood all over the walls.PLANET OF TERROR!!: Skull Heads (2009) Meanwhile, Peter comes into the basement, releases Naomi and quickly save Jensen's life. As Naomi and Jensen are about to escape, Naomi quickly runs back upstairs to get her grandfather and Jensen finds something shocking: Naomi's grandfather has been dead for quite a while. Those who were shown talking with the grandfather were really talking to themselves. Suddenly, his body rises up and surprises Jensen, revealing one of the Skull Heads controlling his body. Jensen runs back downstairs, grabs Kimi's gun, shoots at Carver and Lisbeth near the exit (which has no anvil) and quickly runs outside, shutting the doors behind him. Just as he thinks it's all over, a screaming Naomi opens the doors, grabs Jensen and pulls him back in, slamming the doors behind her, leaving the fate of Jensen unknown.Boning Up on SKULL HEADS Cast References External links  Category:2009 films Category:2009 horror films Category:2009 drama films Category:2009 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American psychological horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Charles Band Category:Films featuring puppetry Category:Films set in Rome ","title":"Skull Heads"},{"id":"24048686","text":"Michigan Railway may refer to: *Michigan Railway (electric) and successor Michigan Railroad *Michigan Railway (1880), predecessor of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad ","title":"Michigan Railway"},{"id":"24048711","text":"John Bernard Delany (August 9, 1864 - June 11, 1906) was an American Roman Catholic bishop.

The two band members were Stephen Ryan (Steveamanakick), the vocalist and guitarist, and Keith Lawler (Giveamanakeith), the drummer. Giveamanakick performed regularly in Ireland, toured the United Kingdom with The Undertones and also performed in Germany during their existence. The duo featured at festivals such as Electric Picnic, Indie-pendence and Hard Working Class Heroes and also took part in the 2fm 2moro 2our. They released three albums; Is it ok to be loud, Jesus? (2003), We Are the Way Forward (2005) and Welcome to the Cusp (2008) before the end was announced in August 2009. Remaining in Limerick throughout the existence of Giveamanakick, the duo were declared \\"the best hard-rock band in the country\\" by rock critic Eamon Sweeney and received the approval of Hot Press, No Discos Leagues O'Toole and Fight Like Apes. History Giveamanakick formed in 2001 following the demise of Tooth. Left with several songs, Ryan performed as a solo artist with an electric guitar. One night, he encountered Keith Lawler, who played guitar in another band at the time, and Lawler began drumming with Ryan. In 2002, the duo released a split single with Mr. Creosote titled \\"Darko Filopovic\\", a song which would later feature as the final track on their debut album. By 2003, they had supported several more established acts, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Rocket from the Crypt. In 2003, there were reports that the duo's debut album, titled Is it ok to be loud, Jesus?, would be released on a label called Larry Gogan Records but this later emerged to be a joke published by a fledgling Foggy Notions. The duo's debut album was in fact published on 3 July 2003 with that same title by the independent label Out On A Limb Records as the label's first release, with Giveamanakick having finished recording it in January that year. It received two out of five stars in a review by RTÉ's Tom Grealis who wrote, \\"this is what happens when rawness comes without any real sense of purpose\\". The Hot Press reviewer said listening to the album was \\"something akin to being battered round the head with a plank of wood for half an hour\\" but, nonetheless, \\"bloody fantastic\\". A second album, We Are the Way Forward, was recorded over an eight-day period and released by Out On a Limb in 2005. It received three from five stars in a review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: \\"you'll get what you paid for from their stomp and swing\\". Phil Udell's Hot Press review gave the album 4.5 out of five stars, saying it \\"gives you that much sought after visceral thrill\\" and that the duo \\"wrote it, recorded it, fucked off. A classic\\". Their live performances also came in for increasing critical acclaim. When Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent attended a show by The Presidents of the United States of America in May 2006, his review stated that they \\"were well and truly blown off the stage by the support band\\" who were Giveamanakick. Stephen Ryan has said in several interviews that their early Sunday morning performance at Electric Picnic in 2006 was \\"one to remember\\" with so many festival-goers coming to view them. He described the performance as a\\" bit of a blur\\" as they \\"pretty dumbfounded by the reaction\\" and the idea of \\"playing with some of our musical heroes such as Dinosaur Jr. and Deftones was a dream come through\\". In 2007, Giveamanakick toured Germany before beginning to record their follow-up album. They did the 2fm 2moro 2our with The Flaws and Messiah J & The Expert. In October that year, rock critic Eamon Sweeney, bemoaning the lack of original Irish music that year, singled out Giveamanakick as \\" the best hard-rock band in the country\\" and said they \\"could teach all those Dublin chancers with stupid haircuts and no ideas a thing or two\\". Giveamanakick were described as a \\"promising act\\" for 2008 by Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent in January of that year. They performed several Irish dates in January that year. Their third album, Welcome to the Cusp, was recorded over a ten-day period in Letterkenny, County Donegal and released on 2 May 2008 on the duo's own label, Monkeyheart Recordings. It received three from five stars in a review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who described the music as \\"immediate and memorable\\". Other publications called it \\"the best Irish record of 2008\\". The track \\"Brittle Bones\\", released as the second single from the album, marked the first use of an acoustic guitar by the duo. Ryan claimed that Welcome to the Cusp was the album which \\"most accurately represents what the Giveamanakick sound actually is\\" and described the songs as \\"possibly the most structurally challenging ones so far\\". Giveamanakick performed a nationwide tour following the release of Welcome to the Cusp, including a date at Indie-pendence in August 2008. Prior to their Friday night performance at Electric Picnic in 2008, Tony Clayton-Lea, writing in The Irish Times, recommended festival-goers to see them, remarking that \\"despite keeping a profile lower than a Dachshund's belly, Giveamanakick have managed to keep things grooving along by virtue of their innate boisterousness and musical flash-bang-wallop\\". In September 2008, Giveamanakick played Hard Working Class Heroes, at which the organisers selected them alongside acts such as The Blizzards and Heathers to play the CMJ Festival in New York City the following month. On 3 April 2009, the duo appeared on Phantom FM alongside Royseven to perform cover versions of Nirvana songs. Giveamanakick's end came with an announcement on 17 August 2009. The final shows are scheduled to take place in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick in November and December 2009.\\\\\\\\\\\\ In June 2013, it was announced that giveamanakick were to reform for one night only to celebrate their label's 10th birthday. Style The duo were described as \\"noise rock's version of The Odd Couple\\" by RTÉ. Ryan once described himself as a \\"Beastie Boys fanatic\\" and the duo were compared to acts such as Pixies. His lyrics regularly featured references to popular culture. However, the opening track on their debut album, titled \\"Ger Canning\\", was not a reference to the broadcaster of the same name. They wrote self-described pop songs, where \\"Keith hits his drums really hard and I [Steve Ryan] like my guitars turned up very loud but we do this with a pop sensibility\\", and employed techniques such as using gas masks to distort their vocals when playing live, performing with streamers and encouraging their audience to disorientate themselves by clapping their own ears. They lived in Limerick throughout their existence, citing a positive music scene, the humour and the hurling as being some of their reasons for liking their home city. Members Stephen Ryan was the guitarist and vocalist. He is originally from Castletroy. He grew up in a background of traditional music, listened to The Beatles on his father's record player, learned how to play the keyboard at the age of ten, the guitar at the age of fifteen and joined a band called Tooth in his early twenties. He has also performed as Windings. Keith Lawler was the drummer. He is from Parteen, Co. Clare. He liked Nirvana when he was fourteen years of age, and learned how to play the guitar when he was a teenager but began to learn the drums at the age of sixteen when he realised that there was a surplus of guitarists in his area. Tooth used to rehearse near his house and he often listened to them from outside. Two of his cousins were already drummers, having performed with The Charming and The Cranberries.

Units currently based there are the Short SC-7-3M-400 Skyvan (scheduled for retirement) and Pilatus PC-6 B2H2 Turbo Porter of 4th Air Squadron, Flight Regiment 1; the Sikorsky S-70A-42 Black Hawk of 1st Helicopter Squadron, Flight Regiment 1, the Agusta Bell AB206A Jet Ranger of 2nd Helicopter Squadron, Flight Regiment 1; and the Agusta Bell AB206A Jet Ranger and Bell OH-58B Kiowa of 3rd Helicopter Squadron, Flight Regiment 1. In addition, the base is the headquarters of the Luftstreifkräfte; it also houses the \\"Bundesfachschule für Flugtechnik\\" (Federal School for Aeronatical Engineering) and \\"Fliegerwerft 1\\", responsible for overhauls and maintenance. History Luftwaffe The construction of Fliegerhorst Brumowski was started in June 1938 for the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) and on 1 October 1939, the first military personnel arrived. When the war with Yugoslavia started in 1941, the airfield served as a jumping off point for aerial attacks against that country. The Air-war School VII, commanded by Major General Volkmann, was established in the summer of 1942. Base strength was about 2000 personnel, including 120 cadets and about 60 officers. The Germans were trained only in light aircraft as part of Primary and Basic flight training. Aircraft assigned included Klemm Kl 35s and Gotha Go 145s; biplane Arado Ar 66s, Bücker Bü 131 Jungmann, Heinkel He 72s; monoplane Focke Wulf FW 140s and Junkers Ju 87 Stukas; 2 and 3 engine Junkers W34s, Junkers Ju 52s, Junkers Ju 88s, and Heinkel He 111s. In the first week of April 1945, the Russians were moving into Austria and the German forces started pulling out. American Operation As part of the Four-Power agreement and the establishment of occupation zones in Austria, the Soviets occupied the base until 26 July 1945. The Americans took command of the Base on the 27th. Under United States control, the facility was called Tulln Air Base and was under the command of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE)'s XII Tactical Air Command. Upon the arrival of American troops at Tulln, the cadre found Russian troops billeted on the Base. The field was a mess. The German demolition crews had done their job well. One hangar was in pretty good shape except for the windows and other minor damage. All others were demolished. Bomber and fighter planes were scattered all over the field and all salvageable parts were removed. The major portion of the Base was blown to rubble, but one barracks, the headquarters building, the vehicle garages and repair shop and a few other buildings were intact.

In December 1947, USAFE activated the 7909th AAF Base Unit to augment the 81st Airdrome Squadron in operating Tulln. On 1 July 1948, all USAFE personnel at Tulln were transferred to the 7360th Base Complement Squadron. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, the mission of the 7360th was to maintain an aerial port of entry in support of Headquarters, USAFE; to include maintenance of a pool of aircraft to be used in the mission of the U.S. High Commissioner, Austria. and to maintain an aerial port of entry for American International air carriers as may be designated by competent authority. Detachments of the 21st Weather Squadron, then the 19th, and finally the 18th Weather SquadronThese were administrative reassignments of the base weather station rather than actual changes of unit provided weather observation and forecasting service. This unit had Austrian weather civilian personnel in training to reestablish the Austrian Weather Service, which had been disorganized by the war. These trainees continued to work in conjunction with Air Force weather personnel until relieved in early 1950. Return to Austrian Control The 7360th Base Complement Squadron was inactivated on 15 March 1954 and control of the base was turned over to the U.S., Allied Commission for Austria (USACA).

The poem's earliest known publication was in July 1919 in The Catholic Press, appearing in 1921 in the anthology Around the Boree Log and Other Verses. The poem describes the recurrent natural cycle of droughts, floods and bushfires in rural Australia as seen by \\"Hanrahan\\", a pessimistic man of Irish descent. \\"'We'll all be rooned', said Hanrahan\\"--an adage extracted from the poem--has entered the Australian English lexicon. Poem Description The poem starts with the area in the grip of a drought, the worst since \\"the banks went bad\\"; a reference to the drought and banking crisis of the early 1890s. :\\"If we don't get three inches, man, ::Or four to break this drought, :We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, ::\\"Before the year is out.\\" In time, the rains \\"drummed a homely tune\\" on \\"iron roof and window-pane\\". The problem then changed from drought to flood. \\"Banker\\" refers to a watercourse filled from bank to bank, unusual in Australia where many watercourses are ephemeral or only intermittently full. :And every creek a banker ran, ::And dams filled overtop; :\\"We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, ::\\"If this rain doesn't stop.\\" \\"In God's good time\\" the rain stopped and spring arrived with \\"harvest-hopes immense\\". The \\"knee-deep\\" grass, while good for feeding livestock, brought to mind the risk of bushfire. :\\"There'll be bush-fires for sure, me man, ::There will, without a doubt; :We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, ::\\"Before the year is out.\\" Popular culture The key refrain in the poem is \\"We'll all be rooned\\" (\\"rooned\\" is a transcription of an Irish Australian pronunciation of \\"ruined\\") which has entered the Australian lexicon as a dismissive response to predictions of disasters or hard times, especially those out of the control of the speakers. The Poem SAID HANRAHAN :\\"We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :In accents most forlorn, :Outside the church, ere Mass began, :One frosty Sunday morn. :The congregation stood about, :Coat-collars to the ears, :And talked of stock, and crops, and drought, :As it had done for years. :\\"It's lookin' crook,\\" said Daniel Croke; :\\"Bedad, it's cruke, me lad, :For never since the banks went broke :Has seasons been so bad.\\" :\\"It's dry, all right,\\" said young O'Neil, :With which astute remark :He squatted down upon his heel :And chewed a piece of bark. :And so around the chorus ran :\\"It's keepin' dry, no doubt.\\" :\\"We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :\\"Before the year is out. :\\"The crops are done; ye'll have your work :To save one bag of grain; :From here way out to Back-o'-Bourke :They're singin' out for rain. :\\"They're singin' out for rain,\\" he said, :\\"And all the tanks are dry.\\" :The congregation scratched its head, :And gazed around the sky. :\\"There won't be grass, in any case, :Enough to feed an ass; :There's not a blade on Casey's place :As I came down to Mass.\\" :\\"If rain don't come this month,\\" said Dan, :And cleared his throat to speak-- :\\"We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :\\"If rain don't come this week.\\" :A heavy silence seemed to steal :On all at this remark; :And each man squatted on his heel, :And chewed a piece of bark. :\\"We want a inch of rain, we do,\\" :O'Neil observed at last; :But Croke \\"maintained\\" we wanted two :To put the danger past. :\\"If we don't get three inches, man, :Or four to break this drought, :We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :\\"Before the year is out.\\" :In God's good time down came the rain; :And all the afternoon :On iron roof and window-pane :It drummed a homely tune. :And through the night it pattered still, :And lightsome, gladsome elves :On dripping spout and window-sill :Kept talking to themselves. :It pelted, pelted all day long, :A-singing at its work, :Till every heart took up the song :Way out to Back-o'Bourke. :And every creek a banker ran, :And dams filled overtop; :\\"We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :\\"If this rain doesn't stop.\\" :And stop it did, in God's good time; :And spring came in to fold :A mantle o'er the hills sublime :Of green and pink and gold. :And days went by on dancing feet, :With harvest-hopes immense, :And laughing eyes beheld the wheat :Nid-nodding o'er the fence. :And, oh, the smiles on every face, :As happy lad and lass :Through grass knee-deep on Casey's place :Went riding down to Mass. :While round the church in clothes genteel :Discoursed the men of mark, :And each man squatted on his heel, :And chewed his piece of bark. :\\"There'll be bush-fires for sure, me man, :There will, without a doubt; :We'll all be rooned,\\" said Hanrahan, :\\"Before the year is out.\\" John O'Brien References External links *Questioning Hanrahan: Environmental optimism and realism in the 21st century *Address by the Governor of Queensland *Said Hanrahan - Notes on the poem.

Far from the cylinder, the flow is unidirectional and uniform. The flow has no vorticity and thus the velocity field is irrotational and can be modeled as a potential flow. Unlike a real fluid, this solution indicates a net zero drag on the body, a result known as d'Alembert's paradox.  Mathematical solution  Colors: pressure field. is high and is low. Velocity vectors. Close-up view of one quadrant of the flow. Colors: pressure field. is high and is low. Velocity vectors. Pressure field (colors), stream function (black) with contour interval of from bottom to top, velocity potential (white) with contour interval from left to right. A cylinder (or disk) of radius is placed in a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid flow. The goal is to find the steady velocity vector and pressure in a plane, subject to the condition that far from the cylinder the velocity vector (relative to unit vectors and ) is :\\\\mathbf{V}=U\\\\mathbf{i}+0\\\\mathbf{j} \\\\,, where is a constant, and at the boundary of the cylinder :\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{\\\\hat n}=0 \\\\,, where is the vector normal to the cylinder surface. The upstream flow is uniform and has no vorticity. The flow is inviscid, incompressible and has constant mass density . The flow therefore remains without vorticity, or is said to be irrotational, with everywhere. Being irrotational, there must exist a velocity potential : :\\\\mathbf{V}= abla\\\\phi \\\\,. Being incompressible, , so must satisfy Laplace's equation: : abla^2\\\\phi=0 \\\\,. The solution for is obtained most easily in polar coordinates and , related to conventional Cartesian coordinates by and . In polar coordinates, Laplace's equation is (see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates): :\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r}\\\\left(r \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial r}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{r^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\phi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} = 0 \\\\,. The solution that satisfies the boundary conditions is :\\\\phi(r,\\\\theta)=Ur\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,. The velocity components in polar coordinates are obtained from the components of in polar coordinates: :V_r=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial r} = U\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\right)\\\\cos\\\\theta and :V_\\\\theta=\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = - U\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\right)\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\,. Being inviscid and irrotational, Bernoulli's equation allows the solution for pressure field to be obtained directly from the velocity field: : p=\\\\tfrac12\\\\rho\\\\left(U^2-V^2\\\\right) + p_\\\\infty, where the constants and appear so that far from the cylinder, where . Using , : p=\\\\tfrac12\\\\rho U^2\\\\left(2\\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\cos(2\\\\theta)-\\\\frac{R^4}{r^4}\\\\right) + p_\\\\infty \\\\,. In the figures, the colorized field referred to as \\"pressure\\" is a plot of : 2 \\\\frac{p - p_\\\\infty}{\\\\rho U^2} =2\\\\frac{R^2}{r^2}\\\\cos(2\\\\theta)-\\\\frac{R^4}{r^4\\\\,}. On the surface of the cylinder, or , pressure varies from a maximum of 1 (shown in the diagram in ) at the stagnation points at and to a minimum of −3 (shown in ) on the sides of the cylinder, at and . Likewise, varies from at the stagnation points to on the sides, in the low pressure.  Stream function  The flow being incompressible, a stream function can be found such that :\\\\mathbf{V}= abla\\\\psi \\\\times \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\,. It follows from this definition, using vector identities, :\\\\mathbf{V}\\\\cdot abla{\\\\psi}=0 \\\\,. Therefore, a contour of a constant value of will also be a streamline, a line tangent to . For the flow past a cylinder, we find: : \\\\psi= U \\\\left( r - \\\\frac{R^2}{r} \\\\right) \\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,.  Physical interpretation  Laplace's equation is linear, and is one of the most elementary partial differential equations. This simple equation yields the entire solution for both and because of the constraint of irrotationality and incompressibility. Having obtained the solution for and , the consistency of the pressure gradient with the accelerations can be noted. The dynamic pressure at the upstream stagnation point has value of . a value needed to decelerate the free stream flow of speed . This same value appears at the downstream stagnation point, this high pressure is again need to decelerate the flow to zero speed. This symmetry arises only because the flow is completely frictionless. The low pressure on sides on the cylinder is needed to provide the centripetal acceleration of the flow: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial r}=\\\\frac{\\\\rho V^2}{L} \\\\,, where is the radius of curvature of the flow. But , and . The integral of the equation for centripetal acceleration, which will over a distance will thus yield :p-p_\\\\infty \\\\approx - \\\\rho U^2 \\\\,. The exact solution has, for the lowest pressure, :p-p_\\\\infty = - \\\\tfrac32 \\\\rho U^2 \\\\,. The low pressure, which must be present to provide the centripetal acceleration, will also increase the flow speed as the fluid travels from higher to lower values of pressure. Thus we find the maximum speed in the flow, , in the low pressure on the sides of the cylinder. A value of is consistent with conservation of the volume of fluid. With the cylinder blocking some of the flow, must be greater than somewhere in the plane through the center of the cylinder and transverse to the flow.  Comparison with flow of a real fluid past a cylinder  The symmetry of this ideal solution has a stagnation point on the rear side of the cylinder, as well as on the front side. The pressure distribution over the front and rear sides are identical, leading to the peculiar property of having zero drag on the cylinder, a property known as d'Alembert's paradox. Unlike an ideal inviscid fluid, a viscous flow past a cylinder, no matter how small the viscosity, will acquire a thin boundary layer adjacent to the surface of the cylinder. Boundary layer separation will occur, and a trailing wake will exist in the flow behind the cylinder. The pressure at each point on the wake side of the cylinder will be lower than on the upstream side, resulting in a drag force in the downstream direction.

Potential flow over a circular cylinder with slight variations Regular perturbation analysis for a flow around a cylinder with slight perturbation in the configurations can be found in Milton Van Dyke (1975). In the following, will represent a small positive parameter and is the radius of the cylinder. For more detailed analyses and discussions, readers are referred to Milton Van Dyke's 1975 book Perturbation Methods in Fluid Mechanics. Slightly distorted cylinder Here the radius of the cylinder is not , but a slightly distorted form .

Parabolic shear Here a parabolic shear in the outer velocity is introduced. :\\\\begin{align} \\\\psi &= U \\\\left(y + \\\\tfrac16 \\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{y^3}{a^2}\\\\right)\\\\,, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\omega &= - abla^2 \\\\psi = - \\\\varepsilon U \\\\frac{y}{a^2} \\\\quad \\\\text{as } x\\\\rightarrow-\\\\infty \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Then the solution to the first-order approximation is :\\\\psi(r,\\\\theta) = Ur\\\\left(1- \\\\frac{a^2}{r^2}\\\\right)\\\\sin\\\\theta + \\\\varepsilon \\\\frac{Ur}{6} \\\\left( \\\\frac{r^2}{a^2}\\\\sin^2\\\\theta - 3 r \\\\ln r \\\\sin \\\\theta + \\\\chi \\\\right) + \\\\mathrm{O}\\\\left(\\\\varepsilon^2\\\\right) \\\\,, where is the homogeneous solution to the Laplace equation which restores the boundary conditions.

Now let be the internal pressure coefficient inside the cylinder, then a slight normal velocity due to the slight porousness is given by :\\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = \\\\varepsilon U \\\\left(C_\\\\mathrm{pi} - C_\\\\mathrm{ps}\\\\right) = \\\\varepsilon U \\\\left(C_\\\\mathrm{pi} +1 - 2\\\\cos 2\\\\theta\\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\text{at } r=a \\\\,, but the zero net flux condition :\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{1}{r}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\theta = 0 requires that . Therefore, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\theta} = - 2\\\\varepsilon r U \\\\cos 2 \\\\theta \\\\quad \\\\text{at } r=a \\\\,.

The two later volumes contained chapters written by James Gilbert Baker, George Ellery Hale, George Willis Ritchey and others on topics ranging from lens grinding to monochromators to photoelectric photometry. Much of the information, including Porter's articles on the Springfield mount and Franklin Wright's and Henry E. Paul's articles on the design and construction of Schmidt cameras, appeared for the first and only time in these books. The ATM books are widely credited with having initiated the amateur telescope making movement in the United States. They are often referred to collectively as the \\"bible\\" of amateur telescope making. Origins Shortly after joining the editorial staff at Scientific American in 1923, Ingalls happened to see an article by Russell Porter in Popular Astronomy magazine describing the work of \\"The Telescope Makers of Springfield, Vermont.\\" Ingalls contacted Porter, who arranged a visit to New York. Porter convinced Ingalls to use Scientific American as a platform for \\"spreading the telescope making virus.\\" The first article appeared in November 1925; in it, Ingalls wrote that if there was a strong enough response from readers, he would write a follow-up article with instructions for making a mirror and mounting for a simple telescope. Nearly a thousand letters were received, and Ingalls and Porter collaborated on two more articles which appeared in February and March 1926. A fourth article in April 1926 contained a simpler treatment of telescope making by John M. Pierce of the Springfield Telescope Makers. The first edition of ATM appeared in 1926. It contained 102 pages, and consisted of the two Porter articles plus extensive extracts from a 1920 book, The Amateur's Telescope, by Irish astronomer Rev. W. F. A. Ellison.Ellison, W. F. A., The Amateur's Telescope (1920) The 820 copies of the first printing were sold out by mid-1928. The book was reprinted many times in more expanded editions; the final edition in 1980 had 510 pages. In May 1928, Ingalls began a regular column for Scientific American on telescope building called \\"The Back Yard Astronomer.\\" In about a year the title was changed to \\"The Amateur Astronomer\\", about six years later to \\"The Amateur Telescope Maker\\", and from 1937 to 1948 it was called \\"Telescoptics\\". Eventually Ingalls chose to broaden the column's scope to include \\"how-to's\\" from all fields of science, changing the column's name to \\"The Amateur Scientist\\" which it retained until 2001. In the meantime, two additional volumes had appeared: Amateur Telescope Making - Advanced (1st printing, 1937) and Amateur Telescope Making - Book Three (1953). These were based largely on articles that first appeared in Ingalls' column, plus some chapters that were commissioned for the books. Philosophy The ATM books promoted a philosophy of telescope making that eschewed standardization and rote rule-following, emphasizing instead the importance of intellectual involvement and creativity in the solution of problems, as well as the highest standards in optical and mechanical performance. In the \\"Preface\\" to the 3rd edition (1932) of Volume 1, Ingalls wrote > Telescope making is a scientific hobby and it appeals doubtless because it > exacts intelligence; requires patience and sometimes dogged persistence in > order to whip the knotty but fascinating problems which arise; demands hard > work -- is not dead easy; and compels the exercise of a fair amount of > handiness -- enough to exclude the born bungler but no more than is > possessed by the average man who can \\"tinker\\" his car or the household > plumbing...The hobby also appeals because the worker derives something of a > thrill while shaping the refined curve of the glass as he realizes that, > with scarecly any special tools...he is able to work to within almost a > millionth of an inch of absolute perfection. He continued > Some of the workers -- a very few -- have strongly urged that the amateur's > telescopes be standardized on a few definite type specifications, arguing > that this would save labor. Others believe that standardized hobbies connote > standardized people with standardized ideas, and that the introduction of > mass production and labor-saving ideas of efficiency in connection with a > hobby is comparable to hiring a workman to play one's games for him. A hobby > should be a way to waste time, not to count it. Publication history Volume 1 Volume 1 underwent substantial changes in content in its 2nd and 3rd editions.

In The Essential Ewan MacColl Songbook, Peggy Seeger wrote that the song was written in the period 1937-9 but could not give an exact year (although it is difficult to see how it could have been written before the First Battle of Gandesa in April 1938). The song was not copyrighted until 1963 by Stormking Music. It tells the story of a shipyard worker from the Clyde who goes to fight with the International Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. He fights at the Battle of Belchite, and is killed at Gandesa (it is not clear if this is at the first or second battles, the International Brigade played an important role in both). MacColl adapted it from a traditional Scottish song about a soldier who fought in the Peninsular War, only retaining the first verse. By some accounts, Jamie Foyers was an actual person who was killed at Burgos in 1812, but by other accounts it was originally a generic Perthshire term for a soldier. There is a last verse in some recordings of the song that does not appear in the version in The Essential Ewan MacColl Songbook. :He lies by the Ebro in far away Spain, :He died so that freedom and justice might reign; :Remember young Foyers and others of worth :And don't let one fascist be left on this earth.

Gunasekaran (born 3 June 1962) is an Indian politician and has twice been elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Tamil Nadu from the Manamadurai constituency.  Personal life  Gunasekaran was born in Nelmadur on 3 June 1962. He has a BA degree and is married with three children. Gunasekaran lists agriculture as his occupation. A study comparing sworn election affidavits for members of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly who had won their seats in the 2006 elections and were standing as candidates in those of 2011 revealed that Gunasekaran had recorded the biggest percentage increase in assets. The increase was 3396 per cent. In June 2014, Gunasekaran was hospitalised, with police saying his condition was \\"highly critical\\", after being attacked by several people while talking with a group of friends in Manamadurai. Police said that the attack happened after a heated discussion with one of the attackers regarding property rights.  Politics  Gunasekaran was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly as an All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate from Manamadurai constituency in the 2006 elections.

The elections of 2016 resulted in his constituency being won by the AIADMK's S. Mariappankennady, whom the party had determined should replace Gunasekaran. In January 2017, Gunasekaran announced that he could not work with the current AIADMK leadership, whom he said wanted to encourage dynastic politics. He had been a strong supporter of Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK leader and Chief Minister who had recently died, and preferred to support Deepa Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa's niece, in her bid to head the party. He said that he had been a supporter of AIADMK since 1987 and that his decision to favour Jayakumar's aspirations was backed by many thousands of AIADMK people in Sivaganga district, in which the Manamadurai constituency is situated. He felt the new leadership was being unfair in its allocation of party positions in the district.

Background The album is a lot different from his debut, displaying a more upbeat and pop- rock sound. Butler trimmed away the soft rock elements from People Move On, which used a lot of string instrumentation. Instead, Friends and Lovers sees Butler bring the guitar to the forefront of the musical output. Butler has described the record as: \\"More direct, more concise, no strings.\\" The album was recorded in London and Chipping Norton, and mixed in New York by Andy Wallace. David Simutis of Phoenix New Times concurred that the record is an upbeat affair. He wrote that \\"the main emotion captured on Friends & Lovers is happiness. From the up-tempo power chords, organ and handclaps of 'I'd Do It Again If I Could,' to the bouncing beat and guitar textures of 'What Happened to Me,' it's a powerful record of hope.\\" Singles released from the album were \\"Friends and Lovers\\" and \\"You Must Go On\\". \\"You Must Go On\\" charted at number 44 on the UK Singles Chart. The album had a delayed release on Columbia Records in the US the following year 1 February 2000. The only US single release from the album, \\"I'd Do It Again If I Could\\" followed shortly after. Reception Some critics saw it as a step forward from his debut. Sarah Zupko of PopMatters wrote: \\"Friends and Lovers is more anthemic and self- assured than People Move On, as though Butler has been steadily gaining confidence in himself as a frontman.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that Butler has greater focus on this record, however felt that the music needed \\"a larger-than-life personality, a vocalist on the level of Brett Anderson.\\"Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ \\"Friends and Lovers review\\"]. AllMusic. Jay Hedblade of the Chicago Tribune had a more mixed sentiment, saying: \\"Bernard Butler offers more textured, palatable rock cast in a classic mode. Like his debut, People Move On, Butler demonstrates he's adept at building gorgeous mile-high melodies that hit all the right buttons, yet as agreeable as it is, there's still a nagging feeling that something's missing.\\" Although he did say the album had \\"brilliant moments\\", he concluded by saying: \\"elsewhere Butler spends too much time waxing poetic without the verbal dexterity to hold up the grand nature of the tunes.\\" The album was not a commercial success, this was mainly due to the breakup of Creation Records shortly before Butler was due to embark on a UK tour. As a result, the tour was cancelled and he was unable to fully complete his promotional duties for the album. The album charted at number 43 on the UK Albums Chart.

After graduating high school he went to Baltimore College, graduating in 1912 with a degree in dentistry. He accepted a commission in the navy as a lieutenant (junior grade) in 1915 while living in Massachusetts and retired August 1, 1948, at the rank of vice admiral. Lyle was serving as a dental officer with the 5th Regiment of the United States Marine Corps on the French front during World War I. On April 23, 1918, he risked his life to rescue a corporal who had been seriously wounded during heavy shellfire. He saved the corporal's life by treating his wounds using surgical aid and became one of only three dental officers in history to receive the Medal of Honor. At the time of the award the navy still had two different versions of the Medal of Honor, one for combat operations and one for noncombat operations. For his actions saving the corporal's life, Lyle received the combat version of the Medal, known as the Tiffany Cross. He died July 15, 1955, in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery Arlington, Virginia. His grave can be found in section 2, lot 1114-1.

Part of the Balaban and Katz chain, the lavishly decorated venue, with plush carpeting and velvet drapes, featured some of the most celebrated African-American entertainers in America.

Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Dinah Washington, Miles Davis, Sammy Davis Jr., Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, and Duke Ellington performed frequently at the theater through the 1920s and 1940s.The Regal Theater and Black Culture By C. Semmes Other acts who have performed at the Regal over the years have included such icons as The Sheppards Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson, The Supremes, Wayne Cochran, The Esquires The Temptations, The Four Tops, Herbie Hancock, Della Reese, Stevie Wonder, Les Paul, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Lola Falana, Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, Solomon Burke, International Sweethearts of Rhythm, Dionne Warwick, James Brown & The Famous Flames, The Isley Brothers, John Coltrane, Dorothy Dandridge, Revella Hughes, Five Stairsteps, Peg Leg Bates, Dave Peyton and Martha and the Vandellas. Closed in 1968, the theater was later demolished in 1973.  History  The Regal was a major complex that featured films, dance, music, and comedy. The theater was a prominent entertainment venue for over four decades in Chicago, Illinois. This theater opened on February 4, 1928 and was located in the “Bronzeville” area of Chicago. The theater was designed by Levy and Klein and was influenced by the Harlem Savoy Ballroom located in New York City and was owned by a white business association in Chicago. This complex was able to seat about 3,000 people and had several big names come through to perform. The theater was one of the first entertainment complexes that was available for black audiences and also employed black staff members (other than the musical acts). This theater featured silent films, musicians of all types of genres—mainly jazz and blues, and some of the biggest names throughout music history. With the ability to see black performers, films, and shows, African Americans were immediately drawn to the theater. Several big names were brought in to perform the popular music of that era. Some of the performers that were brought in included: Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Stevie Wonder, Ella Fitzgerald, The Temptations, Miles Davis, Nat “King” Cole, Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson, the Jackson Five, and several others. Typically the shows featured at the Regal consisted of an opening musical act followed by a silent film—which was accompanied with music for dramatic effects. The owner strategically placed the theater in the area because of the Savoy Ballroom and South Center Department store that were both up the street—which was a nightclub and shopping center for blacks, respectively. The feel of the theater was elegant and formal. Velvet seating, large pillars, and beautifully decorated—the Regal was definitely a site to see. Costing $1.5 million to construct, the Regal opened new doors for African Americans in the entertainment business. Before the Regal, blacks (in Chicago) were usually not able to find jobs other than the typical low-income jobs, but new employment opportunities were beginning to come about. The Regal eventually had a black manager, hired black entertainment, ushers, dancers (only light-skinned women), and coat checkers which at the time was highly unheard of. One of the house bands that got recruited for the Regal was Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra. They had been an opening act at the Savoy Ballroom and had begun to gain a following. Aware of their increased popularity, Balaban and Katz hired Fess Williams and his Royal Flush Orchestra to act as a house band for the theater. The Regal Theater and the nearby Savoy Ballroom created an atmosphere for families to go out and have a good time in the city—which was a helpful business factor. With the great influx of people coming into the theater, more and more complexes began to open in big cities. The Regal Theater has been often compared to the Apollo Theater in Harlem when considering the best quality of entertainment for an African-American audience. However, the Regal opened six years before the Apollo came into running (which opened in 1934). In addition, the Regal was designed in the first place to be the very best in African American entertainment, unlike the Apollo, and had double the seating capacity. Both theaters were able to attract several big names, but there were a greater amount of big names that performed at the Regal. Prior to the opening of the Regal, Chicago endured The Great Migration, which brought a large number of blacks from the south into the city looking for a new life and work. After the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, blacks began to slowly move from their southern homes. Once blacks had the ability to move away from their slave owners and find industrial jobs, the north was able to provide this “new life” for them. Over a 20-30 year period, waves of thousands of blacks left the south and entered major cities like Chicago, New York City, Detroit, and so on. For most of its time, the Regal thrived with business by bringing in musical talents from across the country. People had some of the best times at the theater which helped spread the word about it and bring in more business. Eventually, with developments in technology like with the radio and cable TV, business began to decline. With the repercussions of all these factors, the Regal began losing more and more business which eventually led to the owner having to file bankruptcy and close down the theater in 1968. The building was later demolished in 1973. The site is now occupied by the Harold Washington Cultural Center. Notable events In June 1962, \\"Little\\" Stevie Wonder recorded his famous live version of the number-one hit single \\"Fingertips\\" at a Motortown Revue there that included Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson & The Miracles, Mary Wells, and The Marvelettes. In May 1964, during a performance at the theater, Aretha Franklin was crowned, \\"the Queen of Soul\\" by music promoter Pervis Spann. B.B. King recorded his famous live album Live at the Regal at the theater in November 1964. Gene Chandler appeared many times at the theater, and recorded a live album there in 1965 (variously titled Live at the Regal and Live On Stage In '65). From August 12–27, 1968, The Jackson 5 opened for Motown acts Gladys Knight & The Pips and Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers. References Green, Adam (2007).

Description  Miner's Residence Powderhouse ruins The Central Mine Historic District covers the remains of the nearly abandoned mining town of Central. The district includes around 20 frame structures from an original 130, as well as scattered ruins.Central Mine Historic District from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/19/09 Most remaining structures are frame, two-story company houses on stone foundations. These houses all have gable roofs, porches, and lean-to additions. The district also contains the well-maintained Central Mine Methodist Church, which is in nearly original condition.  History  In 1854, John Shawson, an agent of the Cliff Mine, discovered native copper in the bottom of an ancient pit (apparently dug by Native Americans) several miles from Cliff Mine.Central Mine from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/19/09 The Central Mining Company was organized in 1854 for the purpose of mining copper in the Keweenaw. Mining began in 1856, and the mine's lode proved so rich that Central became was able to turn a profit in its first year of operation. Between 1856 and between then and the end of the 19th century the company built over 130 structures for the mine and the community of workers. At the peak of production in 1868, the town of Central was home to over 130 people, primarily immigrants from Cornwall, England. The mining industry eventually contracted, and by 1887 the Central Mine was the only fully operational mine in Keweenaw County. In 1898 the mine ceased operation, and residents began leaving the town. The last permanent resident left in 1952, although some structures in the area are still used as summer cottages.

Beginning in 1856, worship services were conducted in the Central schoolhouse.Church history from the Central Mine Methodist Church Construction on the church was begun in 1868 as a joint effort between the Central Mining Company and employees, primarily immigrants from Cornwall, England. The church was completed in 1869, and promptly became a community center for the town. Peak membership was over 300 people. However, after the Central Mine closed in 1898, the population in Central swiftly declined and the church closed. In 1907, one of the original residents of Central, Alfred Nicholls, conceived of the idea of a \\"homecoming,\\" where ex-parishioners would gather at the church once a year. The idea was implemented, and as many as 200 people attended the annual gatherings. These reunion gatherings have been held annually since, and continue into the 21st centuryCentral Mine and Village from the Keweenaw County Historical Society, retrieved 8/19/09 The church is in nearly original condition, with the only changes made in 1879, when some pews were removed, and in 1968 when a bell was hung in the belfry.

The New York segment of the trail had been built in 1923, but work stalled until 1929, when Perkins found a willing worker in his home state. He tapped Ned Anderson to map Connecticut's 50-mile leg. It was quickly accomplished between 1929 and 1933. Judge Perkins was also a dynamic leader in the Connecticut Forest and Park Association (CFPA). He was a member of its Blue Blazed Trails Committee, under whose auspices Anderson worked. This committee was responsible for creating a series of walking trails throughout the state. CFPA maintains over 800 miles of blue-blazed trails to date.

The light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, even as its condition deteriorated, resulting in its placement on the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List.  History  The diminutive island is the “peak of an underwater mountain” between the tip of the Keweenaw Peninsula and Manitou Island. The bay on the eastern side of the Keweenaw Peninsula offers protection to mariners from the prevailing northwestern winds on Lake Superior; however, the passage by Gull Rock, a tiny islet about one-half mile off Manitou Island's western tip, proved a serious threat.Gull Rock Light Station from the state of Michigan, retrieved 8/19/09 With that in mind, in 1866 Congress appropriated $15,000 for lighthouse construction on Gull Rock. Construction began in 1867 and the light was put into service on November 1 of the same year. The lighthouse shares its design with that of Granite Island Light and Huron Island Light Station.Terry Pepper, Seeing the Light, Gull Rock Island Light Station. In 1901, a retaining wall was built northeast of the structure to protect the lighthouse from waves washing over the island. In 1913, the light was automated and responsibility for care of the light was transferred to the keeper of the nearby Manitou Island Light Station. Since that time, Gull Rock was all but abandoned and the station fell into disrepair. In 2005, the station was transferred to the Gull Rock Lightkeepers, a nonprofit organization. They are working to restore the lighthouse, which is still an active navigational aid. The original Fourth Order Fresnel lens was manufactured by Barbier and Fenestre of Paris. It is said to be on display at Whitefish Point Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, although Terry Pepper claims that the lens may be misidentified. Lighthouse painted white; lantern and gallery painted black; roofs are red. Gravely endangered by erosion and wave action, this lighthouse is on the Lighthouse Digest Doomsday List. The lighthouse exterior was recently repaired and painted. The interior had been left open, and is in ruins with the removed roof jettisoned into it, and it suffered extensive water damage.Shook, Jeff, (Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy) Terry Pepper, Interior photograph of Gull Island Light. The rocky shoals claimed six vessels, namely: Spokane (October 28, 1907), E.N. Saunders (May 30, 1910), L.C. Waldo (November 8, 1913), Taurus (November 27, 1918), Samuel Mather (October 19, 1923), Charles C. West (September 7, 1926). All were salvaged and removed to sail another day. The likely culprit was low visibility due to fog. The failure to place a fog signal would have been a factor. It is said that this was a low priority area, used by relatively few vessels, “as a short-cut . . . to find safety on the lee side of the point during northerly storms, [and not] a normal traffic route.”Nelson, Don, Gull Rock Lighthouse (April, 2002) Lighthouse Digest. As noted by Terry Pepper, the author of Seeing the Light and the Director of the Great Lakes Light Keepers Association: \\"Two hundred and fifty feet in length and one hundred feet in width, the highest point of Gull Rock stood less than twelve feet above the water under the calmest conditions, becoming virtually invisible in the gray darkness of stormy days when vessels were most likely to be threading their way through the passage.\\" Major structural repairs were done on the light in the summer of 2012.  Description  Gull Rock light station in 2017 (note Bald Eagles on chimney) The Gull Rock Light includes both the light tower and an attached keeper's house. The tower is constructed of brick, and measures high with internal stairs. The lantern is iron with ten sides and vertical bars. The original lens was a Fourth Order Fresnel lens manufactured by Barbier and Fenestre of Paris. The original lens was replaced by a plastic lens; this lens continues to function in the light. The keeper's house is a two-story structure, constructed of brick with a gable roof. The house has suffered severe interior deterioration because of the length of time it has been abandoned. It formerly had a dormer, which is now missing.Gull Rock Lighthouse from the Michigan Lighthouse Conservancy. A brick outhouse is also on site and survives to this day.

On January 2, 1907, Guertin was appointed the third Bishop of Manchester by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 19 from Archbishop Diomede Falconio, with Bishops Matthew Harkins and Michael Tierney serving as co- consecrators. His tenure lasted for over 24 years (the longest in the history of the Manchester Diocese), and spanned the industrial changes of the early twentieth century, the hardship of World War I, the economic distress of mill closings, and ultimately the Great Depression.

Moore killed two policemen (Arnold Strickland and James Crump) and a dispatcher (Leslie Mealer) after being booked on suspicion of stealing a car. He then fled in a highway patrol vehicle. Moore was apprehended later in Mississippi. According to the Associated Press, after his recapture he said, \\"Life is a video game. Everybody's got to die sometime.\\" Once in custody, Moore quickly confessed. He told detectives that he shot the men because he didn't want to go to jail.Dwyer, Kevin and Fiorillo, Juré. True Stories of Law & Order: SVU. 2007: Berkley/Penguin, page 139. () The controversy involving his relation to Grand Theft Auto was revealed during an episode of 60 Minutes on March 4, 2005. In the episode, a student demonstrated Grand Theft Auto to them, showing them the adult nature of the game. Moore, who recently graduated from high school, was never in trouble before. He enlisted in the Air Force and was due to leave for service at the end of the summer. Legal proceedings Moore faced trial in 2005 and pleaded not guilty. The trial judge barred the defense from introducing evidence to the jury that Grand Theft Auto incited Moore's shooting spree. Moore's attorney, Jim Standridge, contended that Moore was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder at the time of the crimes. Standridge argued that, as a child, Moore had been emotionally and physically abused by his father. In August 2005, Moore was convicted as charged. On October 9, 2005, he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. Jim Standridge appealed the case. On February 17, 2012, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Moore's conviction in a 5–0 decision. The case will automatically be appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court, and can then be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Formed in July 1940, the unit took part in a couple of small-scale raids in France in 1941 and contributed some personnel to Operation Chariot before taking part in the landings on Madagascar in 1942. In late 1943 it was sent to India with the rest of the 3rd Special Service Brigade and subsequently took part in operations in Burma throughout 1944 and 1945. Following the end of the war the unit undertook occupation duties in Hong Kong where they were amalgamated with No. 1 Commando on 23 March 1946 to form 1/5 Commando before eventually being disbanded in February 1947. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p.5 At first they were a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy-occupied territory,Chappell, p.3 but by 1943 their role had changed into lightly equipped assault infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p.8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell, p.6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew, p.48 Each commando would number around 450 men commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments and retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman, p.12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p.12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed in brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman, pp.84-85 No. 5 Commando It was initially formed at Bridlington 23 July 1940 from volunteers for special service from units in Western Command.Moreman 2006, p. 12. In October, when the commandos were reorganised into \\"Special Service\\" Battalions, No. 5 Commando was amalgamated with No. 6 Commando becoming a company-sized element in the 5th Special Service Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, based at Helensburgh in Scotland.Moreman 2006, p. 18. In March 1941, the battalion was broken up again into its constituent parts and No. 5 Commando was re-raised under Lieutenant Colonel William Sanguinetti on 26 February 1941,William Scurfield Swire Sanguinetti. formerly of the Hampshire Regiment. They also moved to Barrhead and then Falmouth. Early raids No. 5 Commando's first operations were undertaken on the night of 30–31 August 1941, when two parties of fifteen men carried out landings near Hardelot and Merlimont in France as part of Operation Acid Drop. The objectives of the raids were to generally harass the garrison and to carry out reconnaissance and gather intelligence. In the end, however, they spent only half an hour ashore and failed to make contact with the defenders before re-embarking on their landing craft. Later, in March 1942, No. 5 Commando provided a troop of demolition experts to take part in Operation Chariot, the raid on St. Nazaire.Saunders 1959, p. 70. These men were attached to the force under Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman, who was the commanding officer of No. 2 Commando, which provided the main assault force for the raid. Involving the ramming of a destroyer, into the gates of the drydock at St. Nazaire in France in order to prevent it being used as a base for the Tirpitz, the raid was later described as the \\"greatest raid of all\\".Chappell 1996, p. 19.Saunders 1959, p. 68. Madagascar In early 1942, the British began an operation to seize the island of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.Chappell 1996, pp. 22–23. Due to heavy German U-boat and aerial activity in the Mediterranean the main shipping route to India at the time was around the Cape and there were concerns following the advance of the Japanese throughout southeast Asia, that if the Japanese were able to capture the port at Antsirane and the anchorage in Diego Suarez bay then they would be able to disrupt the sea lanes of communication between Britain and the subcontinent.Brayley 2002, p. 13.Saunders 1959, p. 86. Following the British attack on the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir a pro-Vichy government had been installed on the island, and the British concern about the island being occupied by the Axis grew. As a result, on 5 May 1942, an amphibious force consisting of three infantry brigade-groups with naval and air support undertook Operation Ironclad.The 29th Brigade was independent brigade group for this operation, while the 5th Division consisted of the 13th and 17th Brigade Groups. For this operation, No. 5 Commando, numbering some 365 men under the command of Lieutenant Colonel W. Sanguinetti, was attached to the 29th Brigade and landing ahead of the main force near Courrier and Ambarata Bays on the northern tip of the island and roughly to the west of Diego Suarez, they carried out a raid on a French coastal artillery battery. It was the first major amphibious operation carried out by Allied forces in the war. At dawn on 5 May, after the transport vessels and their escorts had managed to slip through a stretch of water previously thought impassable due to the presence of reefs, the commandos embarked upon assault landing craft and proceeded to their landing beach down a channel that had been swept clear of mines by a small force of corvettes. Landing at the base of a cliff, which they then proceeded to scale, they achieved complete surprise over the French officers and colonial troops manning the two guns. At dawn they were counter-attacked by a platoon-sized element of French colonial troops against which the commandos carried out a bayonet charge, targeting the non-commissioned officers leading the attack and after they had been killed the remaining defenders laid down their weapons and surrendered. The commando casualties were described as being only \\"very light\\" in the brief engagement. For the next two days, the commandos continued operations around Cap Diego as the main force, having landed at Ambararata, drove towards the port of Antsirane, attempting to take it from the rear—on the opposite headland across the channel from Cap Diego, to the south—capturing Fort Bellevue and the airfield in the process. As part of these operations the commandos marched from where they had landed at Courrier Bay across the isthmus that separated the Cap D'Ambre from the larger land mass to the south, and moved to Cap Diego where they carried out mopping up operations and were briefly engaged with a French Foreign Legion troop and in the battle that followed about 50 legionnaires were wounded. On 8 May 1942, following an amphibious assault by Royal Marines which were landed from the destroyer HMS Anthony, Antsirane fell and the anchorage captured; the Vichy French forces, however, continued to resist, and having withdrawn to the south, a prolonged land campaign began, although hostilities remained at relative low-intensity level, consisting mainly of delaying tactics on the part of the French. No. 5 Commando then went briefly to Mombassa where they carried out rehearsals for the next phase of the campaign which, for the commandos, came on 10 September 1942 when they carried out a landing at Majunga, which was another port on the western coast of the island. The plan called for a dawn landing at the docks, but after some of the landing craft broke down they were delayed and the landings took place later in the day without the cover of darkness. As the defending French colonial forces opened up on the landing craft with four machine guns, the support vessels fired on the shore in an effort to provide cover to the assaulting troops, which took a number of casualties as they stormed the quayside. Once ashore, the commandos took control of the local post office, severing communications with Tannanarive, before storming the Governor's Residence and raising the Union Jack. British troops landing from a Landing Craft Assault at Tamatave, 1942 Later they returned to the anchorage at Antsirane and embarked upon the destroyers HMS Arrow, Active and Blackmore. Escorted a naval force consisting of the battleship HMS Warspite, the aircraft carrier Illustrious as well as three cruisers and 14 destroyers, they took part in a landing at Tamatave, where the garrison surrendered after a heavy naval bombardment, before beginning the advance on Tannanarive, in conjunction with troops from the King's African Rifles who struck out from Majunga. On 18 September, after the French rejected a proposal for an armistice, they took part in another landing, this time at Ambalavo. In October, before the fighting ended—the French finally surrendered on 5 November 1942—the commandos embarked for the United Kingdom, arriving there in December. Although in the end they were involved in only limited combat, the experience that the commandos gained from this proved valuable later on when they were deployed to the Far East to fight against the Japanese. India and Burma 1943–44 By 1943 the commando concept had evolved from the original purpose of small-scale raiding and a re-organisation was undertaken in which the units were organised into formed brigades with administrative, transport and other support elements being inserted into the formations, which became part the divisional-sized Special Service Group headquarters under the command of Major General Robert Sturges.Chappell 1996, p. 30.The Special Service Group, and the individual brigades, were later renamed to replace the title Special Service with Commando. This organisation was responsible for administering all the commando units in the United Kingdom (later Europe), Italy, and the Far East. Laffin 1999, p. 18. As a result of this, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel D.M Shaw, No. 5 Commando became part of the 3rd Special Service Brigade under the command of Brigadier Wilfred Nonweiler,Wilfred Ivan Nonweiler, later major general. along with Nos. 1, 42 (Royal Marine), and 44 (Royal Marine) Commandos.Chappell 1996, p. 28. In November 1943 the brigade embarked for overseas and after a five-week voyage No. 5 Commando, as well as No. 44 (Royal Marine) Commando, arrived in Bombay, India on 19 December 1943 where they became part of Mountbatten's South East Asia Command, which had been set up earlier in the year.Saunders 1959, p. 304.No. 1 and 42 (Royal Marine) Commandos were diverted en route, after their ship was bombed and they were forced to put into Alexandria while repairs were undertaken. As a result, only half the brigade took part in the initial fighting it undertook, and it was not until September 1944 that all the units were together again. Saunders 1959, p. 304. They moved by rail from Bombay to Poona where they took up residence at Kedgaon and undertook amphibious landing practice at the Combined Training Centre that had been established at Lake Kharakvasla. In late February 1944, after the Japanese launched a counter- offensive against the Indian 5th Infantry Division in the Arakan, both No. 5 and No. 44 (Royal Marine) Commandos were moved back to Bombay and embarking on HMS Keren they were sent to Cox's Bazar. They arrived there on 5 March, by which time the British and Indian units in Burma had managed to stop the Japanese counter-offensive and had themselves resumed offensive operations. As Indian XV Corps cleared the Maungdaw–Buthidaung road, the commandos landed behind the Japanese near Alethangaw on 11 March 1944. For a couple of weeks they carried out patrols in the Japanese rear before being recalled to Maungdaw on 23 March, where No. 5 Commando carried out a number of attacks on key terrain.Saunders 1959, p. 306. In April, after the Japanese launched Operation U-Go—the invasion of India through northern Burma and Assam—No. 5 Commando were withdrawn from Maungdaw and moved to Silchar, which was an important communications and logistics hub in southern Assam.Saunders 1959, p. 307. For four months they were stationed there, carrying out long-range patrols into the surrounding hills and waiting for the Japanese to arrive. They never made it that far, having been defeated around Imphal and Kohima.Brayley 2002, p. 10. After this a brief period of leave followed before the commandos were moved to Trincomalee in Ceylon, where they joined the rest of the brigade—No. 1 and 42 (Royal Marine) Commandos. 1944–45 They did not remain in Trincomalee for very long, however, for in September the brigade, now renamed 3rd Commando Brigade, was moved to Ramu, near Teknaf in present-day Bangladesh, where they were joined by members of the Special Boat Squadron and began preparing for further operations. Attached to the 25th Indian Infantry Division, throughout November they undertook a number of patrols to islands in the area. In this time, No. 5 Commando was only involved in one such patrol, while the other commandos were more heavily committed, gathering intelligence and carrying out reconnaissance.Saunders 1959, pp. 309–310. In late December 1944 XV Corps, under Lieutenant General Philip Christison, went on the offensive and on 29 December the 3rd Commando Brigade, then commanded by Brigadier Campbell Hardy,Sir Campbell Richard Hardy, later Commandant-General of the Royal Marines. carried out an unopposed landing on the island of Akyab.Saunders 1959, p. 310. Following this reconnaissance operations were undertaken around the Myebon Peninsula and on the surrounding islands. During one of these patrols, a group of commandos from No. 5 Commando had a brief contact with a Japanese force during which they killed four of them without suffering loss themselves. On 12 January 1945, the commando brigade carried out a landing on the peninsula. Coming ashore in the second wave behind No. 42 (Royal Marine) Commando, No. 5 Commando carried the advance inland until they came under machine gun fire from a hill that had been named 'Rose' by the planning staff. The following morning, after air support was called in and tanks from the 19th Lancers were came up, No. 5 Commando launched an attack on the position. In the end the attack was successful and as a result of the defenders deciding to fight to the death, no prisoners were taken. For the next couple of days No. 5 Commando carried out patrols throughout the peninsula as the enemy were cleared from the area, before they were withdrawn back to the beachhead for a couple of days rest. After this the brigade captured the village of Kantha as a preliminary move on Kangow,Saunders 1959, p. 312. across a number of waterways on the mainland, where Christison had decided that he wanted to cut the Japanese line of withdrawal. The terrain was difficult with no roads and consisting of mangrove swamps and rice paddies that prevented tanks or artillery coming ashore initially. The whole area was dominated by a small wooded ridge known as Hill 170. Nevertheless, on 22 January a landing took place, spearheaded by No. 1 Commando, and over the course of the next week or so they and the rest of the brigade were involved in heavy fighting around Hill 170 and the surrounding areas, before finally being relieved on 1 February 1945. During this time No. 5 Commando was placed under the operational command of the 51st Indian Brigade and took part in a number of attacks around positions known as Milford and Pinner, before participating in the final stages of No. 1 Commando's defence of Hill 170, when two troops from the commando reinforced the defenders on 31 January and then took part in beating off the final attack on the following morning.Saunders 1959, pp. 313–314.Throughout the battle the commandos suffered 45 killed and 90 wounded and it was during this fighting that Lieutenant George Knowland, from No. 1 Commando, performed the actions that resulted in him receiving the Victoria Cross posthumously. Saunders 1959, p. 314. After this No. 5 Commando and the rest of the 3rd Commando Brigade moved back to Akyab, before embarking for Madras where, after a brief period of leave, they moved to Lake Kharakvasla again to begin training for Operation Zipper, the invasion of Malaya.

E. F. Britten \\"Oenone\\" or \\"Œnone\\" is a poem written by Alfred Tennyson in 1829. The poem describes the Greek mythological character Oenone and her witnessing incidents in the life of her lover, Paris, as he is involved in the events of the Trojan War. \\"Oenone\\" was inspired by Tennyson's trip to Spain, where he visited the Pyrenees mountains. It is considered the simplest of Tennyson's dramatic monologues. Background Tennyson became friends with Arthur Hallam while at Cambridge. During summer 1829, the two travelled to Spain to help a group of Spanish rebels in northern Spain. While there, Tennyson was able to experience the Pyrenees mountains, which influenced a few of his poems, including \\"Oenone\\", \\"The Lotos-Eaters\\" and \\"Mariana in the South\\". After meeting with the rebels, they travelled to Bordeaux and left for home on 8 September 1829. On that day, Tennyson read to a group of travellers on the boat his newly composed Oenone. Later in 1861, a return to the Spanish mountains and travelling the earlier path would inspire the poem \\"In the Valley of Cauteretz\\".Thorn 1992 pp. 67–69, 341 The poem was included in Tennyson's 1832 collection of poems. It was later revised for his 1842 collection of poems. As with other revised poems, Tennyson removed blends of words that he added to his early poems, with \\"goldensandalled\\" and \\"rosehued\\" as two examples from Oenon.Thorn 1992 pp. 106, 190–191 Poem The poem begins with a lament by Oenone. Although she describes her feelings, there is no one to hear her because her lover, Paris, is off to be with Helen:Hugh 1988 pp. 79–80 :Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills. :Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck :Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest. :She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine, :Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade :Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff. :\\"O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida, :Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die. :For now the noonday quiet holds the hill: :The grasshopper is silent in the grass: :The lizard, with his shadow on the stone, :Rests like a shadow, and the winds are dead. :The purple flower droops: the golden bee :Is lily-cradled: I alone awake. :My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love, :My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim, Oenone is deeply in love with Paris, and she admits that when he is speaking she is unable to act. This is especially true when he reveals to her the Hesperian apple and when he becomes the judge of which goddess is allowed to have the apple as a gift:Hugh 1988 pp. 80–81 :He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm :Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold, :That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd :And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech :Came down upon my heart. :\\"My own Œnone, :Beautiful-brow'd Œnone, my own soul, :Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n :\\"For the most fair,\\" would seem to award it thine, :As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt :The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace :Of movement, and the charm of married brows.\\" (lines 64–75) When Pallas offers her gifts to Paris, he refuses no matter how much Oenone wishes that he would have accepted:Kincaid 1975 p. 37 :but Pallas where she stood :Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs :O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear :Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold, :The while, above, her full and earnest eye :Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek :Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply. :\\"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control, :These three alone lead life to sovereign power. :Yet not for power (power of herself :Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law, :Acting the law we live by without fear; :And, because right is right, to follow right :Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.' :   * :Here she ceas'd :And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, \\"O Paris, :Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not, :Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me! (lines 136–149, 165–168) Aphrodite, the love goddess, follows Pallas and offers a gift that competes against Oenone's role as Paris's wife. This causes Oenone to resort to emotionally appealing Paris:Kincaid 1975 p. 38 :Idalian Aphroditè beautiful, :Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells, :With rosy slender fingers backward drew :From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair :Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat :And shoulder: :   * :She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes, :The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh :Half-whisper'd in his ear, \\"I promise thee :The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.\\" :She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear: :   * :Fairest—why fairest wife? am I not fair? :My love hath told me so a thousand times. :Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday, :When I past by, a wild and wanton pard, :Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail :Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she? :Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms :Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest :Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew :Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains :Flash in the pools of whirling Simois! (lines 171–176, 181–185, 193–203) The poem concludes with Oenone describing contemporaneous events:Hugh 1988 p. 80 :I will rise and go :Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth :Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says :A fire dances before her, and a sound :Rings ever in her ears of armed men. :What this may be I know not, but I know :That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day, :All earth and air seem only burning fire.\\" (lines 258–266) Themes Oenone is the simplest of Tennyson's dramatic monologues. Each of the monologues incorporates an ironic use of rhetoric by the manner in which an individual point of view is incrementally revealed within the poems. The character Oenone laments her fate and is portrayed as a victim to outside circumstances. However, her actions in letting her emotions control her is similar to the actions that Paris, her betrayer, committed; she, like him, is a victimiser to herself. Oenone is similar to other females in Tennyson's poems. In particular, she is a combination of the character Mariana, a quiet woman who suffers like a prisoner as she waits for her lover to return, and Fatima, who loses her mind and submits to her intense passions while losing herself in the material world.Hughes 1988 pp. 64–65 The refrain, \\"Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die\\", reveals Oenone's imprisonment to both the situation she finds herself in and to her emotions. When Paris is offered \\"self-reverence, self-knowledge, self- control\\" by Pallas, Oenone cries out for him to accept the gifts above the others. When he refuses, she is dominated by her emotions in the same way Paris is dominated by his own. Instead, her actions are closer to those of Aphrodite, the goddess that Oenone competes against for Paris's affection.Kincaid 1975 pp. 37–38 The jealousy and possessiveness of Oenone is similar to Tennyson's feelings at the time for Hallam's company, as Tennyson believed that he would be separated from his friend by a woman.Thorn 1992 p. 68 Oenone's song is similar to the events described in the poem. The city of Troy was created in song and ends with its eminent destruction. In a similar manner, Oenone's song comes from the destruction left by Paris. She also shifts from the Mariana-like prisoner type of character to the Fatima-like self-destructive character as the poem progresses. Changes between the 1832 and 1842 edition of the poems reflect changes in Tennyson's role as the poet creating a song and, thus, his similarity to Oenone as a character.Hugh 1988 p. 79–81 Critical response Tennyson's 1832 collection of poems was savaged by John Wilson Croker in a Quarterly Review article of April 1833. The review was based on a close reading of the various poems followed by attacks on the content. Of the various poems attacked, 'Oenone' was the truest hit, as Croker focused on how the poem was filled with unclear descriptions.Thorn 1992 p. 106 Notes References * Hughes, Linda.

It now mainly forms part of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, while the north end has been operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, the Illinois Northern Railway, and most recently the Central Illinois Railroad. History The Chicago and Southern Railroad was incorporated on April 7, 1874, and was opened in 1876 under lease to the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad, which used it as its access to Chicago.Henry V. Poor, Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1877-78, pp. 596-597, 599 (Prior to 1876 the CD&V; had entered Chicago via trackage rights over the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway from Dolton, several miles north of Thornton, where the CD&V; ended.Henry V. Poor, Manual of the Railroads of the United States, 1876-77, p. 591) The Chicago and Southern headed northwest from Thornton, crossing the Illinois Central Railroad at Harvey, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad at Blue Island, and the Chicago and Alton Railroad at Corwith before curving east along 26th Street, crossing the Columbus, Chicago and Indiana Central Railway and ending just west of Western Avenue at a junction with the Lumber District of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad.Robinson's Atlas of the City of Chicago, 1886, Volume 5, Plate 18 The narrow-gauge Chicago, Millington and Western Railway briefly used the portion on 26th Street. The CD&V; was reorganized in 1877 as the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, and on July 31, 1878 the Chicago and Southern was sold at foreclosure to representatives of the Grand Trunk Railway, which reorganized it as the Chicago and State Line Railway. In the next two years, the Grand Trunk completed a line between Port Huron, Michigan and Chicago, consolidating its components on April 6, 1880 to form new subsidiary Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway. To provide improved access to Chicago, the Grand Trunk Junction Railway was incorporated in 1880 and opened in 1881, branching off the old line at Elsdon and following 49th Street east past the Union Stock Yards to the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad,Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1885, p. 982 a terminal railroad that was later controlled jointly by the Grand Trunk Junction and four other railroads. The Chicago and St. Louis Railway opened a line between Pekin and Chicago on December 21, 1885,Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1887, pp. 407-408 initially using the Chicago and Grand Trunk between Corwith and the end in 26th Street. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, which had acquired the Chicago and St. Louis in December 1886 through subsidiary Chicago, Santa Fe and California Railway, bought the line between Elsdon and 26th Street on July 20, 1887. Santa Fe subsidiary Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in Chicago completed a more direct entrance to Chicago in 1888, and in 1902 the Illinois Northern Railway, controlled by the International Harvester Company, which owned a plant near 26th Street, leased the entire line except for short sections at the junctions at Corwith and Elsdon. The Santa Fe also retained its Corwith Yard between these junctions. The Santa Fe eventually bought control of the Illinois Northern, and merged it in 1975.Moody's Transportation Manual, 1992, p. 403 Successor Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway leased the line north of Corwith to new shortline Central Illinois Railroad in 2000.STB Finance Docket No. 33960, December 5, 2000 As for the line south of Elsdon, it remains owned and operated by the Grand Trunk Western Railroad as part of its Elsdon Subdivision.Chicago Operating Rules Association, CN employee timetable, 2007 See also *List of defunct Illinois railroads References Category:Defunct Illinois railroads Category:Predecessors of the Grand Trunk Railway Category:Predecessors of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Category:Railway companies established in 1874 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1878 Category:1874 establishments in Illinois Category:American companies established in 1874 Category:American companies disestablished in 1878 ","title":"Chicago and Southern Railroad"},{"id":"24049949","text":"The Millionaire Calculator built by Egli around 1910 The Millionaire was the first commercially successful mechanical calculator that could perform a direct multiplication.

History  The principle of a calculation machine with progressive transmission of tens was invented by Chebyshev and demonstrated at the 1878 World's fair in Paris. In 1881 Chebyshev demonstrated a model of the calculation machine with automatic multiplication but did not take out a patent for it. In 1834 Luigi Torchi of Milan invented a direct multiplication machine.http://history- computer.com/MechanicalCalculators/19thCentury/Torchi.html The first patented multiplying machines was due to Edmund BarbourBarbour machine on History of Computer website (1872), Ramón VereaVerea machine on History of Computer website (1878) and Léon Bollée (1889).Bollée machine on History of Computer website The Bollée machine could be considered the direct ancestor of the Millionaire. Designed by Otto Steiger, a Swiss engineer, the moving carriage of the Millionaire has a 20 decimal digit accumulator that shows the product after multiplication and into which dividend is entered prior to division. The 10-digit multiplicand or divisor is entered on the sliders (or keyboard, on later models) above the carriage, while successive digits of the multiplier or quotient are entered with a push-button lever on the upper left. A large control knob on the upper right can be set to add, multiply, divide or subtract positions.Henry J. Kennedy, An Ingenious Calculating Machine, American Machinist, Nov. 1, 1906; pages 555-563. The Millionaire was first patented in Germany in 1892. Patents were issued in France, Switzerland, Canada and the United States in 1893, and production started in 1893.Steiger, Otto Steiger, Multiplying or Dividing Machine, , issued May 7, 1895. From 1899 to 1935 Hans W. Egli of Zürich handled the machine. The American agent for the Millionaire was W. A. Morschhauser of New York. During this long life, 4,655 \\"Millionaire\\" machines were sold.These data comes from IBM Computer Museum, but Millionaire SN 6455 and SN 6482 exist.New Machinery and Processes:The \\"Millionaire\\" Calculator, Textile World Record, Vol. 34, No. 1 (Oct. 1907); page 177. The Millionaire was advertised as being the \\"only calculating machine on the market ... that requires but one turn of the crank ... for each figure in the multiplier or quotient,\\" making it the fastest calculator available.The Millionaire Calculating Machine, advertisement, The Executive Economist, Vol. 1, No. 4 (April 1911); back cover. Advertising from 1913 claims that the United States government had purchased over 100 Millionaire calculators.\\"Endorsed by the U.S.Government\\", advertisement, Business, Vol. XXXI, No. 5 (Nov. 1913); page 293.  Competition  All mechanical calculators commercialized prior to the Millionaire, like the arithmometer, the Odhner arithmometer or the comptometer were simple adding machines; they implemented multiplication by continued addition under operator control. In 1889, Léon Bollée, in France, invented a machine that required only one turn of the crank handle to multiply the number entered on the sliders by a multiplier number. This was accomplished by creating a mechanical representation of the multiplication table which could be read and used by the machine. The manufacturing cost of Bollée's machine was too high and the production was discontinued after a few units. The Millionaire was built with the same target of direct mechanical multiplication in mind.Martin, E: The Calculating Machines, page 119, Charles Babbage Institute, 1992 In first decades of 20th century two other machines with direct multiplication were produced: the Moon-HopkinsBurroughs-Moon-Hopkins on Rechnerlexikon and Kuhrt- US.Kuhrt-US on Rechenmaschinen lllustrated These two companies were then taken over by Burroughs and Brunsviga. These machines filled quite a different niche from the Millionaire. They were book-keeping machines with printing features, and were too unwieldy to perform divisions and complex computations. The Millionaire, however, was better suited for technical computations. This machine was very big and heavy and occupied an entire desk. Its size made it awkward to operate.

Originally formed in 2004 as Yonder, the group currently consists of leader Zachary Bennett, (vocals. guitar), Dean Marino (lead guitars/vocals), Johnny Rowe (drums), Dave Fenton (bass) and Steve Savage (keyboards). History In 2004, Zachary Bennett approached Dean Marino, an engineer and budding producer, to record some demos of his band, Yonder. Given a small budget, Marino suggested that the band make the recordings at guitarist Adam Evans's cottage rather than in a recording studio. The result of this three- day session was the Yonder EP, which included early versions of the songs \\"If Only\\" and \\"Jesus Freaks\\". The EP allowed Bennett to book some gigs in and around Toronto, eventually establishing a monthly showcase Bennett named \\"Dusty’s Conundrum\\", at Clinton's Tavern.\\\\- Dusty's Conundrum on Myspace\\\\- YonderMusic.ca During this period (2004–2006), Bennett was able to test his songs on an audience as he established a devoted following and a semi-stable line-up for the band. This included Allison Porter on fiddle, Adam Evans on guitar and Travis Ferris on bass. In 2006 Bennett approached Marino again with the intent of making a \\"proper album\\" at Marino's studio, Chemical Sound. Bennett and Marino took on complementary roles during the making of the album (they are both credited as producers). This eventually morphed into a collaborative musical partnership, with Marino playing several guitar tracks on the finished album (alongside Adam Evans and Mike Daley who also contributed guitar tracks). The album, Skywalk to Crescent Town, was self- released in 2007 and garnered positive reviews.\\\\- Now Magazine Review of \\"Skywalk\\" In late 2007, Dean Marino officially joined Yonder as lead guitarist.

Davis. Plot summary Mike Hagan is an airline pilot of nineteen years experience. He started off in the open cockpit as a crop duster. A cool, capable aviator, he is being considered by his airline for its pilot of the year award. However, this façade conceals a troubled man with a failing marriage who is an alcoholic. The film opens as he awakens hungover and begins the day with a stiff drink and an argument with his shrewish wife. The only bright spots in his life are his loving relationship with his daughter Cricket and his girlfriend Pat. Hagan's skill at the controls is shown when he guides his plane through turbulence that almost causes another airliner to crash. However, a stewardess and Hagan's co-pilot begin to suspect trouble when they notice him continually going to the lavatory with a cup. Hagan keeps a bottle hidden there and begins to drink while he is flying. In denial, he keeps saying that he has it under control. After a harrowing flight in which Hagan makes an emergency landing, almost running out of fuel, his co- pilot refuses to fly with him again. Hagan consults a psychiatrist who teaches him how to cut down on his drinking and gives him medication. The airline assigns a veteran aviator, Larry Zanoff, as Hagan's co-pilot with a secret mission of monitoring Hagan's behavior to determine if Hagan has a problem. The psychiatric therapy is working as Hagan reduces his drinking. Zanoff begins to like Hagan and respect his abilities as a pilot. The film ends as Hagan narrowly averts disaster as the plane's engines catch fire during takeoff. He is acclaimed as a hero. But Hagan's uniform jacket had fallen to the flight deck in the cockpit during the engine fire incident and Zanoff inadvertently finds a small liquor flask in the jacket as he picks up the jacket so he could hand it to Hagan. Hagan tells Zanoff the truth. He resigns his job with the airline and goes back to cropdusting. However, he finally comes to terms with his addiction and plans a happy future with Pat. His doctor tells him the motto of Alcoholics Anonymous: \\"Take it one day at a time.\\" Cast * Cliff Robertson as Mike Hagan * Diane Baker as Pat Simpson * Frank Converse as Jim Cochran * Gordon MacRae as Joe Barnes * Milo O'Shea as Dr. O'Brian * Dana Andrews as Randolph Evers * Edward Binns as Larry Zanoff See also * Flight (2012)  External links  * Category:1980 films Category:1980s action drama films Category:American action drama films Category:American films Category:American aviation films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films about alcoholism Category:Films scored by John Addison Category:1980 drama films ","title":"The Pilot (film)"},{"id":"24050100","text":"Bald Hill can refer to: * Bald Hill (Australia) — A popular lookout in Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia * Bald Hill (Farmingville, New York) — One of the highest points on Long Island, New York, United States * Bald Hill (Mendocino County), hill in California, United States * Bald Hill (Washington County, Missouri), United States * Bald Hill (Snohomish County, Washington), United States * Bald Hill — In San Anselmo, Marin County, California; see list of summits of the San Francisco Bay Area, United States * Bald Hill — A mountain summit in Monroe, New York, United States * Bald Hill Range — A mountain range in Middlesex County, Connecticut, United States * Bald Hill in Mineral County, Montana, United States * Bald Hill, Russia - within the Duderhof Heights See also * Bald Hills (disambiguation) ","title":"Bald Hill"},{"id":"24050102","text":"David S.

According to GamesRadar, it was the earliest video game with cooperative gameplay where two players are forced to work together. A single- player version was released as Smokey Joe.http://www.arcade- museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9593http://www.gameclassification.com/EN/games/1139-Fire- Truck--Smokey-Joe/index.html It is internally identical to Fire Truck. Fire Truck is built on the technology created for Atari's Super Bug released the previous year. Both games were programmed by Howard Delman. Gameplay Screenshot Players must cooperate to drive the truck through traffic as far as possible without crashing. While the game can be played with one player, it was primarily designed for two. The front player steers the tractor of the truck sitting down, controlling the gas and brakes, while the rear player stands, and steers the tiller for the rear wheels, controlling the swing of the trailer. The cabinet also provides the players with bells and horns, although these have no use in the actual game.

It was based on the 1931 Somerset Maugham short story \\"The Vessel of Wrath\\". The film is also known as The Beachcomber in the US. Plot Englishman Ginger Ted is a \\"dissolute beachcomber\\" living in a tropical Dutch colonial possession somewhere in the Indian Ocean. When a ship makes its monthly visit, Ted has to outrun a mob of creditors to obtain his remittance cheque from the Controleur, the colonial governor. However, his friend makes him pay his debts, leaving him only a little. Ginger then gets Lia to sneak out of the classroom of Martha Jones. The homesick man tells Lia of England. Martha has him arrested. He is sentenced to three months on the road gang, but that does not satisfy the puritanical pair of Martha Jones and her missionary brother. They want him deported, but Ginger is the Controleur's only real local friend, so he sends him to alcohol-free Agor Island to try to reform him. When Martha insists on going to another island to attend to a medical emergency, the Controleur sends his sergeant along as escort, with secret orders to pick up Ginger on the way back. When their boat's propeller strikes a reef, they have to spend the night on the nearest island while repairs are made. Martha finds it rather traumatic at first, but then unexpectedly begins to warm to Ginger. After Dr. Jones later thanks Ginger for not taking advantage of his sister, Ginger knocks the Controleur out when the latter laughs at him. While Ginger is passed out drunk on the beach, Martha cleans his shack. When Ginger returns, he demands she leave. Then typhoid breaks out on one of the other islands. the Controleur asks Ginger to accompany Dr. Jones to help inoculate the natives; Ginger refuses at first, then reluctantly agrees. However, when Jones is overcome by a flareup of malaria, Martha insists on taking his place. Ginger backs out, but changes his mind after she starts crying. When they reach the village, they discover that the residents believe the disease is the result of abandoning their old religion. Albert, the headman and a former Christian convert, warns them to leave. Martha insists on confronting the natives, but Ginger drags her away before anything happens. That night, the headman's wife brings her sick child to the pair. Martha inoculates her. When the headman demands his child back, Ginger sends him away. Ominous drumming starts. Facing imminent attack, Ginger tells Martha about how he wanted to marry a barmaid and run a pub, though he was the son of the local vicar; in turn, she tells him her father drank himself to death. Then the child recovers, and the danger is over. The pair marry and return to England to manage a pub, though Ginger gives up drinking entirely.  Cast  *Charles Laughton as Ginger Ted [Edward C.

Cuisine While the city originally had German roots, the influx of immigrants in the late 1800s and early 1900s brought Jewish, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovenian and Ukrainian food to the table: pastrami, pierogis, pizza, and sauerkraut balls. Today's restaurants also feature African, Asian, Middle-Eastern, and Mexican cuisine. Urban farming is part of Akron's cultural landscape. The city has provided many places to grow food, and has also supported many new restaurants: Bricco, Cilantro, Crave, and Lockview. Independent grocery stores include Krieger's, Mustard Seed Market, and Seven Grain Market. Akron has a longstanding claim to being the birthplace of the hamburger. A \\"National Hamburger Festival\\" was held in the city annually for many years.  Fine arts  Founded in 1922, the Akron Art Museum was vastly expanded in the early 2000s and now hosts international exhibitions along with its local collections. Directly across the street from the museum is the small Nightlight Cinema, an independent enterprise. As Vogue describes it, the theater \\"focuses exclusively on locally produced movies, as well as obscure documentaries, foreign films, and first-run indie features (in other words—titles you’ve likely never heard of, and that’s the point)\\". Literature The award-winning Knight-Ridder newspaper chain began in Akron as two separate companies, the Akron Beacon Journal and the German-language New Yorker Staats-Zeitung. The city is the birthplace of Rita Dove, former Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress. Sojourner Truth gave her famous \\"Ain't I A Woman\\" speech in Akron at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in 1851. The city is and has been home to award-winning writers David Auburn and Terry Pluto. A former literary editor of Esquire, Adrienne Miller, came from the Akron suburbs; she later wrote the novel The Coast of Akron. Comic books The landmark Akron pizza shop Luigi's is the inspiration for the pizza shop Montoni's in the comic strip Funky Winkerbean, written by Akron native Tom Batiuk. In the Flaming Carrot Comics, Iron City, where the Carrot lives, was made similar to Akron and another working-stiff town, Pittsburgh. Writer and illustrator Bill Watterson has also lived in the county.  Music  Akron has been home to a wide variety of musical artists including: *country singer David Allan Coe *rhythm and blues singers Howard Hewett, James Ingram, and Ruby Nash Curtis *jazz musician Jeff Golub *folk musician Len Chandler *vocalist Helen Jepson *big band leader Vaughn Monroe *opera singer Russell Oberlin *composer Nikola Resanovic *singer-songwriters Joseph Arthur, Roger Hoover, and Pete Nischt *avant garde musician Ralph Carney *novelty songwriters Buckner & Garcia  Rock music  In the late 1970s, following the international success of local band Devo, talent scouts combed the city. Soon, several compilation albums promoted the \\"Akron Sound\\", a multifaceted music scene led by the Waitresses and Rachel Sweet, and many artists of regional prominence including Tin Huey, Liam Sternberg, Bizarros, and Rubber City Rebels. Other major rock musicians from the city are: The city's music scene is chronicled and commemorated in the Akron Sound Museum, established in 2015.  Concert venues  The Akron Art Museum has hosted free outdoor concerts every summer since 1984. Major venues for music in Akron include the Akron Civic Theatre, E.J. Thomas Hall, and Blossom Music Center. Residents and fans of alternative music still miss the Lime Spider, but continue to appreciate new bands and live poetry at Annabelle's and Paolo's. The North Hill neighborhood was known for jazz during the early 1900s.  Sports and recreation  The city is home to basketball superstar LeBron James, and renamed part of its Main Street to \\"King James Way\\" in his honor. The city hosts a Minor League Baseball team, the Akron RubberDucks, who play in Canal Park. The World Championship finals of Soap Box Derby are held annually at Derby Downs.

Plot Lamont Cranston is an amateur criminologist and detective, who hosts a daily radio program sponsored by the Daily Classic newspaper. He has developed a friendly but occasionally terse feud with Police Commissioner Weston. Cranston complains to his managing editor, Edward Heath, about his incompetent new assistant, Phoebe Lane. Heath advises him that because she is the publisher's niece, she cannot be fired. During his radio broadcast, Phoebe gives Cranston a note that the Metropolitan Theatre is to be robbed at eight o'clock. Afterwards, he learns she got the information from a man she met in a café. Cranston goes to the theatre; Weston and his men have already arrived, but there is no crime. Across town, international banker Gerald Morton is killed and his safe is robbed. Cranston arrives there ahead of the police and gathers evidence. The irate Weston has him jailed as a material witness, but Phoebe gets him released with a writ of habeas corpus in time for his next broadcast. Honest John, a safe cracker whose release from prison was championed by Cranston, bursts into the studio and demands at gun point that Cranston exonerate him; the police suspect that he committed the Morton robbery. Weston rushes to the studio but Honest John escapes. Cranston takes Phoebe on a tour of night clubs and she identifies the man who gave her the robbery warning. Cranston poses as a European visitor and introduces himself to the man, whose name is Flotow. Flotow recognizes Phoebe and invites them to join him and his companion, Starkov, at his apartment after the bar closes. They leave together, but Cranston suspects a trap. He makes excuses to allow Phoebe and himself to depart, but they make a lunch date for the next day. While Flotow and Starkov are waiting for Cranston to join them for lunch, Cranston breaks into Flotow's apartment and discovers Phoebe has already done the same. Cranston answers Flotow's phone; Morton's butler, believing him to be Flotow, tells him there is a meeting at the Morton home that afternoon. Flotow and Starkov return and attempt to detain Cranston and Pheobe. Moe, Cranston's driver, rescues them by flashing his \\"gun\\", which is really a cigarette case. After they leave, Morton's butler calls back and Flotow knows he is suspected. Cranston finishes a newspaper column designed to bait Flotow. As he leaves to act on the intercepted butler's call, Cranston is forced into Moe's cab at gun point by Honest John. Cranston gets the upper hand by using Moe's \\"gun\\". After John confesses that he only came back to town to get a fresh start, Cranston reveals the fake gun and forgives the \\"kidnapping\\". Commissioner Weston is angered by Cranston's column and sends a man to arrest Cranston for withholding information from the police. The policeman gets a tip that Cranston is going to Morton's house. Flotow and Starkov arrive at the Morton house and are admitted by the duplicitous butler. They surprise Morton's brother and force him to open the safe. As they explain their motive for killing his brother, they force him to write a \\"suicide\\" note and give him a gun with one bullet. Cranston and Honest John intervene. John holds the malefactors at gun point, while Cranston lets in the police. As Weston's assistant tries to arrest Cranston, the butler tries to sneak out the front door. Cranston throws a potted plant to hit the butler but hits Commissioner Weston as he enters the door. Cranston's broadcast reveals the details of the case and compliments the police for their conduct of the investigation; both Weston and Heath are pleased.

Relationship with the Crown The title is not correctly used on its own. Since 1399, the kings and lords of Mann were vassals of the kings of England, and subsequently of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, who was the ultimate sovereign of the island. This right of 'Lord Proprietor' was revested into the Crown by the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 for £70,000 and a £2,000 annuity, and hence ceased to exist separately. King George III became the first British monarch to reign over the Isle of Man as Lord of Mann in 1765. However, for reasons of culture and tradition, the title Lord of Mann continues to be used. For these reasons, the correct formal usage, as used in the Isle of Man for the Loyal Toast, is The Queen, Lord of Mann. The title is now Lord of Mann regardless of gender. However, during her reign, Queen Victoria was styled as Lady of Mann. The formal Latin style is . List of lords :Prior to 1504, the ruler of the Isle of Man was generally styled King of Mann. 16th century *Thomas, Earl of Derby, 1504–1521 *Edward, Earl of Derby, 1521–1572 *Henry, Earl of Derby, 1572–1593 *Ferdinando, Earl of Derby, 1593–1594 Succession dispute (1594–1607) In 1598, a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando and their uncle, William, Earl of Derby was heard by the Privy Council. They decided that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I, and the letters patent of 1405 which conferred the lordship of the Isle of Man on the Stanley family were declared null and void as the previous ruler, Henry, Earl of Northumberland, had not been subject to legal attainder, despite his treason, and the 1405 and 1406 letters patent had therefore not taken effect. The Queen, in consideration of the \\"many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley\\", withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance. The Law Lords on the Privy Council decided \\"the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England, such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general, and not to the heirs male\\", and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinando's daughters; whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests. The original letters patent having been declared void, the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled \\"An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby\\" [(1609) 7 Jac.1 c.4] which established the title in law as Lord of Mann. The lordship was conferred by letters patent dated 7 July 1609 upon William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby.Mills, op. cit, pp.514–522 Subsequent succession was under the terms of this grant.Manx Independent: 30 November 2007 . 29 November 2007. iomtoday.co.im. Retrieved on 22 December 2007 Interim lords (1607–1609) Following the resolution of the succession dispute, it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs. As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609, two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I by letters patent, so that the daughters could benefit from the Island's revenues. *Henry, Earl of Northampton, 1607–1608 *Robert, Earl of Salisbury, 1608–1609 Following the coming of age of the heirs, the rights over the island were sold to their uncle, William Stanley. He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament.An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William, Earl of Derby, 1909, Private Act c.4 17th and 18th centuries *William, Earl of Derby, 1609–1612 *Elizabeth, Countess of Derby, 1612–1627 *James, Earl of Derby, 1627–1651 (known as the Great Stanley) *Thomas, Lord Fairfax of Cameron, 1651–1660 (appointed by Oliver Cromwell during the English Interregnum) *Charles, Earl of Derby, 1660–1672 (restored by Charles II) *William, Earl of Derby, 1672–1702 *James, Earl of Derby, 1702–1736 *James, Duke of Atholl, 1736–1764 *Charlotte, Duchess of Atholl and John, Duke of Atholl, 1764–1765 Revestment In 1765, Charlotte Murray, Duchess of Atholl, 8th Baroness Strange, sold the suzerainty of the island to the British government for £70,000 and an annuity of £2,000 (£5,235,000 and £150,000 respectively in modern terms). By the passage of the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 the title of Lord of Mann was revested into the British Crown. It has therefore since been used in the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning British monarch. In 1828, all remaining property interests and rights of the dukes of Atholl on the island were sold to HM Treasury, a department of the British government, for the sum of £417,144, . This was accomplished by two Private Acts of Parliament: * \\"An Act empowering the Lords of the Treasury to Purchase all the Manorial Rights of the Duke of Atholl in the Isle of Man\\" [c. 34] 10 June 1824 * \\"An Act to empower the Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to purchase a certain Annuity in respect of Duties and Customs levied in the Isle of Man, and any reserved sovereign rights in the said Island belonging to John Duke of Atholl\\" [c. 34] 10 June 1825 Lieutenant governor The lord of Mann is now represented by the lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man.

Roh's pre- presidential political career was focused on human rights advocacy for student activists in South Korea. His electoral career later expanded to a focus on overcoming regionalism in South Korean politics, culminating in his election to the presidency. He achieved a large following among younger internet users, particularly at the website OhMyNews, which aided his success in the presidential election. Roh's election was notable for the arrival in power of a new generation of Korean politicians, the so-called 386 Generation (people in their thirties, when the term was coined, who had attended university in the 1980s and who were born in the 1960s). This generation had been veterans of student protests against authoritarian rule and advocated a conciliatory approach towards North Korea, even at the expense of good relations with the United States. Roh himself was the first South Korean president to be born after the end of Japanese rule in Korea. Roh's 2002 election victory also ended the \\"Three Kim period\\" (Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil) domination of South Korea politics since 1970s. South Korea received the highest marks on the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index under his administration. The value of the South Korean won against the US dollar was the strongest during his administration since 1997. Due to the strong currency, for the first time in history, South Korea became the world's 10th largest economy and exceeded the $20,000 milestone in nominal GDP per capita during his administration. However, due to his poor performance in economy and diplomacy, Roh was not a popular president, having the worst approval rating on average ever recorded in South Korean political history. His economic policy was often criticized for persisting with certain obsolete economic views and failing certain livelihood issues. There was considerable friction between South Korea and the US. Former Bush administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice and Robert Gates, in their published memoirs, claimed that Roh was anti-American and disclosed that there had been numerous conflicts between the US and South Korea because of Roh's unpredictability. There has been criticism that Roh's anti-Americanism, nationalism, and pro-North Korean views contributed to a contradiction in diplomacy and impaired credibility among other states. It also led to a decline in some of his popular support, especially among the older generation. Despite high expectations in the beginning, his presidency encountered strong opposition from the conservative Grand National Party and media. They constantly accused him of incompetence, and insulting criticism was frequently published in the media. As a result, many of Roh's policies, including a plan to move the capital and a plan to form a coalition with the opposition, were also attacked and made little progress. After leaving office, Roh returned to his hometown of Bongha Maeul. He ran a duck farm and lived an ordinary life, sharing it through his blog. He also ran a website called \\"Democracy 2.0\\" to promote healthy online discussions. Fourteen months later, Roh was suspected of bribery by prosecutors, and the subsequent investigations attracted public attention. Roh committed suicide on 23 May 2009 by jumping from a mountain cliff behind his home, after saying that \\"there are too many people suffering because of me\\" on a suicide note on his PC. About 4 million people visited Roh's hometown Bongha Village in the week following his death. His suicide was confirmed by police. Personal background Roh was born into a poor farming family on 1 September 1946, in Bongha Village near Gimhae and Pusan, in what is now southeastern South Korea. His parents had three boys and two girls, and Roh was the youngest of his family. In 1953, he entered Dae Chang Elementary School. He received high grades, but was quite often absent from school to assist his parents. While in sixth grade, with the encouragement of his school teacher, he became the president of the school. As he entered Jin-yeong middle school, a writing contest was held to commemorate Syngman Rhee's birthday. Roh tried to start a student movement against it, but was caught and suspended from the school. Roh Moo-Hyun decided to become a lawyer due to the influence of his elder brother who had studied law but had died in a car accident. Roh studied on his own to pass the bar exam in 1975 (South Korea does not currently require bar examinees to have graduated from college, university, or law school). In 1977, he became a regional judge in Daejeon, but quit in 1978, and became a lawyer. In 1981, he defended students who had been tortured for suspicion of possession of contraband literature. Following this he decided to become a human rights lawyer. In early 2003, he was quoted as saying, \\"After that defense, my life was totally changed. At first, even I couldn't believe that they had been tortured that harshly. However, when I saw their horrified eyes and their missing toenails, my comfortable life as a lawyer came to an end. I became a man that wanted to make a difference in the world.\\" With fellow human rights lawyers, he pointed out that this case was forged, then claimed that the National Security Act (South Korea) itself should be judged. In 1985 he started to participate in civic movements by assuming permanent power of attorney on behalf of the Busan council of citizen democracy. He opposed the autocratic regime in place at the time in South Korea, and participated in the pro-democracy June Democracy Movement in 1987 against Chun Doo-hwan. The same year he was jailed while investigating the cause of death of the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering factory worker Lee Seok-Kyu, who had been killed by a stray police tear gas bullet while on strike. Roh was accused of 'unapproved interference in the case' and 'hindering the funeral'. Although he was released in twenty days because of public opinion against the arrest, his lawyer's license was revoked after the incident in political retribution. His lawyer's license was reinstated and he, along with Chun Jung Bae and Im Jong In, founded Haemaru Law firm. Roh was baptized as a Catholic (baptismal name: Justin) in the 1980s but then lapsed while continued to identify as a Catholic, though later years he was non-religious while practiced in some form of Mahayana Buddhism.Hani News The Hankyoreh(3 September 2008). Retrieved 13 September 2008 Early political career Roh entered politics in 1988 when he was invited by Kim Young-sam to join the Democratic Reunification Party (Korean: 통일민주당). That same year, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly, representing Dong-gu, Busan. He came to wider public attention with his cross-examination of the government over political corruption allegations in a parliamentary hearing. In 1990, Kim Young-sam merged his party with the Democratic Justice Party to form the Democratic Liberal Party, a forerunner of the Grand National Party. Roh did not participate in the party and he criticized it as \\"betrayal against the democracy movement\\". In 1991, before the election of the national assembly, the Weekly Chosun posted an article that alleging that Roh was a politician with hidden wealth. Roh sued the company for defamation and won, but lost the election for his seat. Having lost his seat in the 1992 Assembly elections, he later ran for the mayorship of Busan in 1995, where he lost again. Shortly after the election, Kim Dae-jung founded the National Congress for New Politics, but Roh did not join. In 1996, he ran for the Assembly seat for Jung-gu in Seoul, losing to another future president, Lee Myung-bak. Roh founded the new party with Lee Bu-Yeong, Lee Chul, Kim Won-Gi, and Kim Jeong- Gil, but before the presidential election, after the New Korea Party merged with the United Democratic Party, he decided to reconcile with Kim Dae-jung to 'bring the military government and their political heir into justice'. Subsequently, Roh reconciled with Kim when he endorsed his candidacy in the 1997 Presidential election. At the meeting, Kim Dae-jung welcomed Roh and his party saying \\"Today is a very pleasant day. That pleasure is not only because we now work together, but also because I could relieve a burden in my mind that I have been carrying (since we separated).\\" Roh returned to office in 1998, when Lee Myung-bak resigned his seat because of a violation of election law, winning a seat in the ensuing by-election. In 2000, Roh ran for the National Assembly representing Buk-gu and Gangseo-gu in Busan as part of a campaign to overcome regionalism in Korean politics, but was defeated. His defeat in the election, however, proved fortuitous when his supporters formed Nosamo, the first political fan club in Korea. His supporters were inspired by his commitment to overcoming regionalism. In 2000, Roh was appointed Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries under Kim Dae-jung, and this position would constitute his major government experience prior to the presidency. Roh got public attention when he participated in candidate election of his party. The candidate election itself also got high public attention because it allowed the vote not only from the party members, but also the local citizens. At first, his approval rate was 10%, allowing much gap with leading candidate Lee In-Jae, but Roh constantly earned much supporters by his notable speeches, especially in Ulsan, and the result of poll that Roh's approval rate was 41.7%, 1.1% higher than the Lee Hoi-chang, candidate of the opponent party, convinced the voters of his party. Roh won the presidency on 19 December 2002, by defeating Lee Hoi-chang with a narrow 2% margin of victory. At 2003, right before his inauguration, he described his plan as \\"I will root the method of discussion inside the government.\\", and added, \\"discussion should be familiarized until we are called 'Republic of discussion'.\\" Presidency (2003–08) First year Roh dubbed his administration the \\"Participatory Government,\\" and entered office intent on introducing an ambitious new agenda. Policy goals for the Roh administration included the continuance of the Sunshine Policy of engagement towards North Korea, the establishment of Korea as a business hub in Northeast Asia, the expansion of social welfare, the pursuit of \\"balanced national development\\" to help underdeveloped areas, the eradication of corruption, reform of education and tax systems, reform of labor-management relations, reform of mass media, and a recasting of the relationship with the United States and Japan. As his policy for eradicating corruption inside the government had included many administrative reforms, he had to face high opposition. During the reformation of the prosecution, to resolve the opposition, he suggested a TV forum. The prosecutors insisted that Roh appointed the major positions of the prosecutor's office without consulting the personnel committee, and Roh answered that \\"The current members of the personnel committee themselves represent the old prosecution which has to be changed, if we do not change now, it would sustain the old prosecution at least few months.\\" Three months into his presidency, He commented about the opposition problem, stating \\"I'm worrying the opposition that maybe I cannot continue the presidency while I get that much of it.\\" That comment was quoted partly by conservative media, ('I cannot continue the presidency') and Roh was beset by skepticism about his ability and experience. Roh set the tone of his administration with a number of adventurous policies, and measures to uncover and reveal the names of the descendants of Japanese collaborators. The investigations, criticized by opposition parties as a covert means of attacking them, and coming too late to provide substantive redress, mostly resulted in damage to his own party members. Uri Party and impeachment Roh and his supporters left the Millennium Democratic Party in 2003 to form a new party, the Uri Party (). Directly ahead of the National Assembly elections, Roh voiced support for the Uri Party, which constituted a technical violation of Constitutional provisions mandating presidential impartiality. After Roh refused to apologize, led by the opposition parties holding the majority, the Assembly voted to impeach him for illegal electioneering on 12 March 2004. The vote was 193–2 (Uri Party members abstained from the vote). Roh's supporters physically blocked the motion for three days in open combat, and had to be hauled out by security guards.The Impeachment Motion Has Passed Roh's executive power was suspended pending a final decision by the Constitutional Court, and Prime Minister Goh Kun ran the country as the Acting President. The National Assembly's attempt to impeach Roh was largely opposed by the public. From 12 March 2004, to 27 March, protest against the impeachment motion was led by 'citizen's movement for eradicating corruption'. According to the police, 50,000 people gathered to protest on 13 March alone. Although Roh's popularity had hovered around 30%, the impeachment was taken as a power struggle against the political reform and the choice of the citizen, and Roh's popularity went up soon after the assembly's vote to impeach Roh. The results of the April 2004 parliamentary election showed public support for him, with the Uri Party winning a majority of seats. On 14 May 2004, the Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment decision, restoring Roh as president. After the incident, Roh joined the Uri party as a member, officially making the Uri party as the ruling party. It was the first time that a liberal party achieved a majority in the National Assembly. After the reinstatement Roh and his wife Kwon Yang-sook in India with Manmohan Singh and A.P.J Abdul Kalam in 2004 As a part of his balanced national development campaign to reverse the concentration of wealth in Seoul, Roh also pursued a plan to relocate the capital 100 miles away to South Chungcheong Province, ostensibly to relieve congestion. Roh had made this promise during his campaign, and pursued its fulfillment, despite convincing few voters outside the Chungcheong region of the benefits of the move. After much controversy, the Constitutional Court obviated Roh's plans by ruling that the relocation of the capital was unconstitutional because it 'opposes the custom that has to be considered as the constitution', thus inflicting a huge blow to Roh's political standing. Roh's plan was then amended to the creation of an \\"administrative capital,\\" though this plan has also not yet seen completion. The issue of the proposed \\"administrative capital\\" remains controversial as of 2010 in plans for Sejong City, the exact nature of which continues to be a politically divisive issue even within the ruling Grand National Party. With the controversies concerning the capital, perceptions of neglect and mismanagement of the economy had grown. Although exports performed at record levels and the economy grew, growth still lagged behind both the previous administration and the rest of the world, while the domestic economy stagnated. At the same time regulations proliferated, investment capital exited the country, unemployment (especially among the young) increased, wealthy students flocked overseas as the education system stagnated, and housing prices in Seoul soared far beyond the reach of the average citizen. Roh responded by dismissing criticism as \\"shameless mudslinging,\\" and touted the achievements of his government in increasing national competitiveness, strengthening the economy. This somewhat cavalier attitude led to his Uri Party suffering consecutive defeats in the Assembly, before eventually collapsing. Roh's unpopularity had become a liability for his party, and a new party was needed to disassociate from him. The Uri Party would thus be revamped and renamed as the Democratic Party, and is currently the main opposition party in the National Assembly. Roh's ambitious initial promises to establish Korea as an international business hub in Asia faded soon after his election. Instead, Korea under Roh suffered negative publicity in the foreign business community due to prosecutorial investigations on the purchase and sale of Korea Exchange Bank by the Lone Star Fund, spurring foreign investors to join their domestic counterparts in leaving the country. When housing prices soared, to prevent speculative bubble like Japanese asset price bubble crisis, Roh introduced additional 1~3% of property tax on real estate exceeding 600 million won(about 600,000US$). This efficiently slowed down the bubble, but this policy met high opposition from the richest who had to pay higher tax. At the same time, Roh also increased welfare spending by 18% a year, and drastically increased spending by increasing the size of the civil service by more than 95,700 new hires, or approximately 60 people a day. Criticism of lax discipline among the civil service and police force was high during his government. The remainder of Roh's term was characterized by a number of campaigns pursued to varying degrees of success and completion. One of the more successful campaigns (at least during his term) was Roh's pursuit of an FTA with the United States, concluded in April 2007 after many months of negotiations by Kim Hyun-jong, the deputy minister for trade. Roh successfully pushed for the FTA in spite of domestic opposition from his traditional leftist constituency (who denounced it as \\"neoliberal\\") and various groups (particularly farmers) opposed to market opening. Grand coalition plan As a result of the controversy concerning the capital, and public dissatisfaction of economic development, Uri party lost much of its popularity. When the Uri party was defeated in by-elections held on 30 April 2005, losing every one of the 23 electoral districts, Uri Party lost its majority in the National Assembly. Facing the outcome of his unpopularity, Roh took a rather strange measure to manage the government when he proposed a grand coalition with the opposition Grand National Party. Roh's rationale was that since it was impossible to continue his presidency with an approval rate of around 20 percent, a grand coalition comprising the Uri party and the Grand National Party was desirable, and that the difference between both parties in terms of political agendas was actually minute. Roh promised he would yield much of his power and might even resign from office if a grand coalition was successfully launched. Roh's proposal for the grand coalition stirred yet another national controversy. Many called his plan \\"reckless and completely ignorant\\" of the sentiments of people still ailing from repeated political controversies and economic hardships. Many of the Uri party's supporters who identify as liberals were enraged at Roh holding that his party was not really different from the conservative opposition. The Grand National Party, enjoying relatively strong approval rate but still bent on revenge for the party's defeat in major elections, repeatedly declined to initiate a negotiation for the coalition. While the Uri Party grudgingly supported the President's proposal, a lawmaker defected from the party in protest of Roh's plan, and the loss of popularity was felt when the party suffered yet another complete defeat in the by-election on 26 October 2005, this time including one of the party's stronghold electoral districts. Roh's plan was scrapped, having failed to garner support from either political faction. Foreign relations United States President Roh and Bush in October 2003 Roh Moo-hyun and Kwon Yang-sook at the 2006 APEC gala dinner with President Vladimir Putin of Russia (centre) and George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush (right) Roh was perceived as an anti-American before the presidential race, which was not a handicap during the presidential campaign. Public antipathy to the United States was prevalent in 2002, particularly evoked by the Yangju highway incident, where two South Korean middle school girls were crushed to death by a U.S. Army armored bridge-laying vehicle. The American soldiers involved were tried by a U.S. Army court martial, but the Roh administration continued to demand a South Korean trial, although the incident occurred 'on duty' (as part of a convoy) and thus was an American responsibility under the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and South Korea. However, except for the policy toward the North Korea, Roh was supportive toward the United States. Roh endeavored to improve relations with North Korea, becoming the first president to cross the border by foot and meeting Kim Jong-il. He dispatched the Zaytun Division to support the US in the Iraq War by carrying out peacekeeping and other reconstruction-related tasks. Roh explained the deployment as only a peacekeeping mission and claimed that such commitment was required to bring favor from the United States in resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis. He also pursued the KORUS FTA. In 2004, the Roh administration reached an agreement with the US to move out all US forces in the capital to Camp Humphreys, a rural area far away from the capital or major cities, as he deemed the USFK's presence in the capital unnecessary and harming its reputation and development. In February 2006, Roh announced that South Korea would initiate negotiations with the United States for a free trade agreement.한미 FTA 협상 공식 선언 Naver.com, YTN 3 February 2006 In April 2007, Roh presided over an emergency meeting of his aides to discuss the diplomatic fallout from the massacre at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in the United States by a South Korean student, Cho Seung-hui, concerning its negative impact on South Korea-U.S. relations. They were discussing comprehensive measures to cope with the unprecedented incident, including issuance of presidential messages of apology and plans to prevent possible harassment of South Koreans living in the United States. Roh issued two messages of condolence already on 17 April 2007. Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described Roh as \\"anti-American and probably a little crazy\\" in his book titled Duty, and professed astonishment at Roh telling him at the meeting in November 2007 that \\"the two biggest security threats in Asia were the United States and Japan\\". Japan South Korea's relationship with Japan was in a healthy condition when Roh entered office. However, his first visit to the neighboring country in 2003 was scheduled on a date that coincided with Korean Memorial Day. During the visit, Roh proclaimed he would not seek any more apologies from Japan over its colonial occupation, in the hope of maintaining a friendly relationship between the two countries. Although Roh's proclamation was made in good faith, some expressed concern that Japan may have interpreted this as the termination of its responsibility for the colonial past, and use it as an excuse to deny any claims for compensation that may arise in the future. Despite Roh's hope, relations with Japan deteriorated henceforth, in several areas of conflict such as compensation issues for comfort women, denial of the colonial past in Japanese history textbooks, and disputes over the Liancourt Rocks. Another sensitive issue, former Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi's repeated visits to Yasukuni Shrine were harshly criticized in South Korea, and Roh declared no further meetings with Koizumi would take place unless he stopped visiting the shrine. According to Rep. Chung Mong- joon, former leader of the ruling Saenuri Party, \\"The Roh Moo-hyun administration proposed that the U.S. define Japan as a hypothetical enemy,\\" at the Korea-U.S. Security Consultative Meeting in Seoul in October 2005. \\"President Roh proposed it because the general public had bad feelings against Japan and Korea had a territorial dispute over the Dokdo islets with Japan, Washington was very embarrassed since it had hoped Korea and Japan would go hand-in-hand as free and democratic countries. A hypothetical enemy in English implies a main enemy.\\" In an address to the nation on 25 April 2006 regarding disputes over the Liancourt Rocks, Roh reaffirmed that he didn't seek another apology from Japan, but demanded that Japan take action in compliance with its past apologies. The then-Prime Minister of Japan Junichiro Koizumi characterized the speech as intended for domestic audiences. Retirement After leaving office, Roh retired to Bongha Maeul, a small village in his hometown. This marked a break with previous custom, where former presidents retired to heavily guarded houses in Seoul. Bongha – a village of 121 people – became a major tourist attraction due to Roh's presence. Bribery allegations On 4 December 2008, Roh Moo-hyun's elder brother, Roh Gun- Pyeong, was indicted on charges of illegally taking 3 million won from former Daewoo Engineering & Construction and imprisoned. On 7 April 2009, Chung Sang- Moon, the former secretary of Roh Moo-hyun was arrested on charges. In early 2009, allegations of corruption had begun to surface regarding the former President's family and aides, eventually leading to the indictment of Roh's elder brother Roh Gun-Pyeong on suspicion of influence peddling. The investigation soon expanded to encompass Roh Moo-Hyun's aides, as well as other members of his family.Prosecution widens corruption probe involving Roh's family As the investigation closed in on Roh's former secretary, Chung Sang-Moon, Roh announced on his website that \\"The accusation should be directed at our household, not Chung. Our household made the request, received money and used it.\\" At the same time, Roh claimed that he himself had not known of the money transfer before his retirement. By May 2009, prosecutors had summoned Roh's wife, son, and eventually the former president himself on suspicion of receiving 1 million dollars in bribes from Park Yeon-Cha, a businessman close to the ex-President. Roh was subject to initial written questioning by prosecutors, before direct questioning, prior to which he apologized again to the public and stated that \\"he was overwhelmed by shame.\\" Kang Kum-won was another Roh's long time supporter whose business was under thorough investigation by The Supreme Prosecutors' Office (SPO). Even if Kang was Roh's closest long time supporter, he did not expand his business during Roh's presidency to avoid unnecessary suspicion of special benefits. However, his parole was denied during the investigation despite his terminal illness of brain cancer until Roh's death. Roh's investigation for corruption came after he had campaigned on pledges to \\"clean up the presidency,\\" and root out corruption, while condemning his opponents as hopelessly corrupt.South Korea's \\"Mr. Clean\\" accused of graft In one speech to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Korea's \\"June Struggle\\" for democracy, Roh vehemently attacked critics who described him as incompetent, stating, \\"They even deal out the absurd rhetoric that they would rather have a corrupt administration than an inept one while openly revealing their true colors as forces of corruption and the security-driven dictatorships of the past. What's more, they label the democratic forces as being inept, plotting to rise to power on the back of the nostalgia for the development-oriented dictatorships of the past.\\" Roh's characteristically self-righteous stance resulted in harsh condemnation of the ex-President for hypocrisy. In response to the pervasive criticism upon Roh's bribery charges, he stated on his website, \\"I have lost my moral cause just with the facts I have so far admitted. The only thing left is the legal procedure\\". Roh further added, \\"What I have to do now is bow to the nation and apologize. From now on, the name Roh cannot be a symbol of the values you pursue. I'm no longer qualified to speak about democracy and justice.... You should abandon me.\\" Despite these appeals, Roh continued to deny all knowledge of the receipt of money by his family from Park Yeon-Cha, in contradiction to Park's testimony. Roh refused cross-examination with Park. In contrast to scandals involving previous presidents, who reportedly used illicit funds close to $500 million to finance political campaigns and their family activities, Roh's family had to use borrowed funds close to $1.5 million from a friend for personal use, such as the payment of living expenses for study in the United States. Death Roh Moo-Hyun was found seriously injured on the morning of 23 May 2009 after apparently jumping from a cliff known as Bueong'i Bawi (lit. Owl's Rock) behind his rural home in his home village of Bongha. He sustained serious head injuries and was sent by car to Seyoung hospital nearby at 7:20 am and moved to Busan University Hospital at around 8:15 am (and pronounced dead at around 9:30 am (00:30 GMT). Security camera footage of the compound were not released. Police investigators ruled out conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Roh. According to police, Roh switched on his computer and typed a hastily worded suicide note. The police report stated that the suicide note apologized for making \\"too many people suffer\\" and requested that his body be cremated. The 8th president, Kim Dae-jung, stated that \\"President Roh Moo-hyun loved Koreans more than any other presidents [...] During the unfair investigation, he suffered from all sorts of humiliation, chagrin, deception, and defamation, which left him no option but to commit suicide before his countryman to show his innocence.\\" The 10th president, Lee Myung-bak, stated that \\"the news was truly unbelievable and deeply saddening.\\" Justice Minister Kim Kyung-han said the corruption case against him would be formally closed. However, he did not say whether the former president's family would continue to be investigated. Roh's suicide followed the suicides of a number of high-profile figures under corruption investigations in Korea in recent years, including the former secretary of Prime Minister Kim Young-chul, former Busan mayor Ahn Sang-Young (who committed suicide while in prison),Busan Mayor's suicide Called 'Political Terror' Park Tae-young, former governor of Jeolla province,South Jeolla Province Governor Commits suicide and Chung Mong-hun, a former Hyundai executive. Roh himself had been sued by the widow of former Daewoo E&C; head Nam Sang-Guk for allegedly making defamatory comments that drove her husband to throw himself off of a bridge.Executive's Body Found 11 Days After Han River suicide Roh's suicide was followed later in the year by the suicide of another politician, the Mayor of Yangsan, who was being subject to a corruption investigation.suicide rings a warning of election debts’ high costs Sidewalk memorial for Roh set up across the street from Seoul City Hall on 10 July 2009. By 27 May, Roh's bodyguard revealed that he was not with the former president when he committed suicide. Roh's public funerary ceremony involved both Buddhist and Catholic rites. Hundreds of thousands of supporters turned out to pay their respects in memorial shrines erected around the country, as did President Lee Myung-bak and numerous other prominent politicians. Sporadic violent demonstrations in Seoul immediately after the funeral resulted in the detention of 72 people. Roh's suicide resulted in a sudden positive shift in domestic perception towards the late President, leading Kim Dong-gil, one of the conservative figures to comment, \\"How could he become an instant saint upon his suicide?\\" Perceptions of an excessive investigation on Roh's alleged improprieties boosted support for the opposition Party (itself formed when Roh's then unpopularity made it a liability to be associated with him), giving them enough leverage to demand that President Lee Myung-bak apologize for the \\"politically motivated\\" investigation they claimed caused Roh's death, and discipline those responsible. Support for the opposition party increased to 28.3%, outpolling the ruling GNP at 23.5%. The Democratic Party also decided to block the scheduled opening of the National Assembly until the Lee Myung- bak government accepted responsibility for Roh's suicide. The chief prosecutor in Roh's bribery case also resigned. A year after Roh died, his autobiography was published by his personal and political fellows. Based on Roh's previous books, unpublished draft, notes, letters and interviews, it follows Roh's life from birth to death. He died about 3 months before former President Kim Dae- jung died on 18 August 2009 of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Former Prime Minister Han Myung-suk and others claimed that the investigation of Roh's corruption case leading to his death was president Lee's political revenge and murder. Legacy In January 2010, dissatisfaction with the poor electoral showing of the minority Democratic Party, and a posthumous reappraisal of Roh Moo-hyun's presidency spurred the creation of a new party, the \\"Participation Party (South Korea).\\" This party was created to \\"revive the spirit of former President Roh Moo-hyun.\\" One of Roh's biggest accomplishments was revising regulations for political fundraising, which even one of his harshest critics praises. Before the revision, previous presidential candidates received more than $300 million hush money from leaving president to run the presidential campaign. During Roh's initial campaign for the presidency, civilians donated their piggy banks raising close to $1.2 million, but not enough to match about $12 million his opponent raised. The Institute for Future Korea () is established for researching and promoting Roh Moo- hyun's social ideas. A WikiLeaks American diplomatic cable to South Korea revealed that Roh Moo-hyun expressed concerns how the US government mistreated North Korea. Lee In-gyu (), the former head of the SPO released his book on the involvements of the political corruptions surrounding the investigation against Roh that led to his suicide. In his book, Lee acknowledged that the South Korean National Intelligence Service had intentionally released overly sensational stories about President Roh's bribery charges. In 2010, 1 year after his death, the politicians who were Roh's aides won the local elections and became the provincial government heads. In January 2012, Han Myung-Sook who had been one of the prime ministers in Roh's tenure was elected party leader of the biggest opposition party, Democratic United Party. She officially made clear \\"succession of Roh's policy\\". Although his policy was regarded as failure when he was in the position, it has been reevaluated as liberal and nationalistic, compared to Lee Myung-Bak's authoritarian and pro- US policy. Even a conservative professor, Lee Sang-Don, who had severely criticized Roh's policy, said that \\"Roh became a myth (of our age) .\\" On the 10th anniversary of his passing, former US President George W. Bush paid respects at the annual memorial ceremony for Roh Moo- hyun.https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/05/23/George-W-Bush-honors- former-President-Roh-Moo-hyun-in-South-Korea/7161558598332/ See also * 2002 South Korean presidential election * List of Korea-related topics * Roh's involvement in Hwang Woo-suk scandal * U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement References External links * Official English page of Roh Moo-hyun * The Opened We Party (in Korean) * Nosamo: Roh Moo-hyun's fan club (in Korean) * \\"Roh Defiant on Korea-US Tension\\", The Chosun Ilbo, 25 January 2006. * \\"Profile: Roh Moo-hyun\\", BBC News, 14 May 2004. * \\"President Roh Moo-hyun and the New Politics of South Korea\\", The Asia Society, February 2003. * \\"Roh Moo- hyun, South's Man of the People\\", The Age, 26 February 2003. * \\"Profile: President-elect Roh Moo-hyun\\", CNN, 31 December 2002. * Cheong Wa Dae Office of the President (English) * Biography from Roh's Cheong Wa Dae archives (English) Category:1946 births Category:2009 deaths Category:People from Gimhae Category:South Korean Buddhists Category:South Korean Roman Catholics Category:Jurists who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:South Korean politicians who committed suicide Category:Members of the National Assembly (South Korea) Category:South Korean lawyers Category:South Korean agnostics Category:Suicides by jumping in South Korea Category:Impeached officials Category:South Korean judges Category:Honorary Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Uri Party politicians Category:Democratic Party (South Korea, 2000) politicians Category:Collars of the Order of Civil Merit Category:Gwangsan No clan Category:Heads of state who committed suicide Category:Suicide in 2009 Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Roh Moo-hyun"},{"id":"24050328","text":"The Raistlin Chronicles is a pair of novels, The Soulforge and Brothers in Arms, set in the Dragonlance campaign setting of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. The Soulforge The Soulforge is a fantasy novel written by Margaret Weis and set in the Dragonlance campaign setting. The novel was first published in January 1998, and covers the early life of the character Raistlin Majere. The story begins from Raistlin's childhood, and follows his progress through magic school. Many things occur that foreshadow the great power that he would one day attain, and offer an explanation as to why he is often vindictive and power hungry. The book concludes with Raistlin's test at the Tower of High Sorcery of Wayreth. The account of the test conflicts somewhat with a story that appeared in one of the books of the Dragonlance Legends trilogy, but gives a much more detailed account of how Raistlin came by his golden skin and hourglass eyes, and also how he bested the ancient archmage, Fistandantilus, from the time before the fall of Istar. Inspiration Margaret Weis has acknowledged Terry Phillip's The Soulforge gamebook for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons as the inspiration for the novel. Cultural references Power Metal band Blind Guardian wrote a song about The Soulforge, titled \\"The Soulforged\\", on their album A Night at the Opera. Reviews *Review by Wayne MacLaurin (1998) in SF Site, May 1998, (1998) Brothers in Arms Brothers in Arms is a Dragonlance book, the second of the Raistlin Chronicles, written by Margaret Weis and Don Perrin.

They winter in Haven, setting out in the spring towards Langtree. At the same time, Kitiara uth Matar, the twins' sister, is in Sanction, trying to advance in the ranks of the Dragonarmy. To prove her worth, Ariakas sends her on a special mission: convince the red dragon Immolatus to come to Ariakas in Sanction, where he will receive orders from him. Kitiara succeeds, and the orders are to go to the city of Hope's End, and find the hiding place of the Gold and Silver Dragon Eggs. Meanwhile, the twins have joined the Army of the Baron Ivor, and are trained: Raistlin as a war mage by Master Horkin, Caramon as a warrior. They also meet Scrounger, a half-kender and fellow recruit, and forge a friendship with him.

Migration history With Zambia's 1964 independence from the British Empire, many members of national liberation movements in neighbouring countries, including Angola, found the country a hospitable base for their operations. However, eastern Angola (near the border with Zambia) was less densely populated than the northern region adjacent to Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo); Zaire and not Zambia thus because the primary destination for Angolan refugees in those days. Most of these refugees were of Balovale ethnicity, an ethnic group also present in Zambia. The Zambian government aimed to move them away from the border; they were settled first at Zambezi in North-Western Province and in Mayukwayukwa in Western Province. Later, due to ethnic tensions, those in Zambezi were transferred to Meheba near Solwezi (also in Northwestern Province). The refugee population reached roughly 25,000 by 1972, despite efforts by the Zambian government to control the influx and return new arrivals to Angola. With the onset of the 1975 Angolan Civil War, the number of refugees began to expand, and repatriation efforts also came to a halt. Peace briefly returned to Angola with the 1991 Bicesse Accords and brought hope to the government that they could repatriate the refugees, but fighting resumed in 1992, resulting in a new influx. By the end of that year, the number of Angolan refugees had reached 101,779. The number would continue to expand; by 2001, it was estimated that there were 200,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia, making up about 77% of all refugees in the country. Rather than living in refugee camps or finding assistance through government resettlement schemes, many Angolan refugees settled on their own in Zambian villages. In 2002, a peace deal was brokered which ended the war. By 2006, an estimated 63,000 had repatriated to Angola. However, the term \\"repatriation\\" itself may be misleading; one study of Angolans in Zambia found that they saw themselves simply as villagers; relocating from their villages in Zambia to Angola was not perceived as going home, but in contrast as leaving home in search of a better life.

Out of several locations across Vilnius used by market traders to sell the wares of folk artists, Pilies Street is the most popular. It has a natural advantage over the Town Hall Square as the street is generally busy and less likely to be interrupted by the political or cultural events commonly held at the Town Hall. Many people visit the street to buy gifts at Christmas or before going abroad to visit friends. The market is also popular with souvenir hunters. Souvenir shops offer amberware and amber jewelry as well as linen clothes. The street is also known for the Kaziukas Fair, when folk artists from all four corners of Lithuania gather here to display and sell their latest merchandise. Festivals in Vilnius frequently take place on Pilies Street – most processions will make their way through here at some point. This is true whatever the festival – be it Christmas, Easter, the day of Restoration of Independence, or just a spontaneous celebration following a major win for the Lithuanian basketball team.

The edge of a regional innovation system may be drawn conceptually and organizationally around the economic, social, political and institutional relationships that generate a collective learning process within a related group of technological or functional areas. A recent study has shown that innovation output is higher in regions where both a sizable population of small firms and large firms are present. In the European context, the European Union following a regional development model (dividing European territories in administrative and statistical national subdivisions) gives great emphasis to RIS. The regional innovation systems had been favoured especially after the setting of Lisbon's strategy goals. Now regional innovation policies had been incorporated in various larger or smaller EU initiatives and policy packages and large part of the investments by the EU structural funds is devoted to the creation or enhancement of the local-regional innovation systems.KOUKOUFIKIS G., 2014.

Five years after joining the Indian Civil Service, he was appointed tutor to the Maharajas of Kolhapur and Bhavnagar, and later (1896–1902) was tutor and guardian to the Maharaja of Mysore. The Fraser Town locality in Bangalore was named after Sir Stuart Fraser. Early life Stuart Mitford Fraser was educated at Blundell's School and Balliol College. He passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service in 1882 and was allocated to the Bombay Presidency. Tutoring of princes Within 5 years Fraser was selected as guardian and tutor to the Raja of Kolhapur, later to become Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj after being educated at Rajkumar College, Rajkot. He later had responsibility for the leadership preparations of the Maharajah of Bhavanagar, Shri Bhavsinhji II (1875–1919) after schooling at Rajkumar College, Rajkot like his father, Takhtsinhji and son, Krishna Kumarasingh Bhavasingh the last Maharaja of Bhavnagar. In 1896 Fraser was appointed as governor and tutor to the young Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Maharaja of Mysore, who was later to become known as a beneficent ruler who enhanced the reputation of Mysore as a model state. SIR STUART FRASER - TRAINING INDIAN PRINCES Sir Stuart Fraser, K.C.S.1., C.LE., died at Christchurch on Sunday in his one- hundredth year. The outstanding feature of his career was that of his guidance of and friendship to a number of important rulers of Indian princely states, Thereafter he was for more than a quarter of a century a diligent member, and sometime alderman, of the Hampshire County Council, and engaged in much philanthropic work in the county. Stuart Mitford Fraser was born on June. 2, 1864, the son of J.D. Fraser, and was educated at Blundell’s School, Tiverton, and Balliol College, Oxford. He passed the LCS. examination in: 1882 and was allotted to the Bom- ay _ presidency. Within five years he was selected to be guardian and tutor to the minor Raja of Kolhapur, afterwards Maharaja Shri Shau Chatrapati (1884-1922). Fraser also had charge of the preparation for rulership of the Chief of Kagal and the progressive Maharaja of Bhavanagar. Shri Bravasinhji II, who died in 1919, Fraser’s notes for his own guidance on the training of the princes-were so wise that they were subse- quently sent to the principals of all Chief Colleges in India and came into official use. In 1896 Fraser was selected to be tutor and governor to the minor Maharaja of the important State of Mysore, then a boy of 12\\\\. During the formative six years. which elapsed before the Maharaja was invested with full powers by Lord Curzon he. had a thorough, if sometimes exacting, preparation for his life’s work. Throughout the 38 years of his beneficent rule he entertained a profound affection for his mentor. Aided by a succession of able Dewans and notably, during the last 15 years, bv the tenure of his old classmate Sir Mirza Ismail, the Maharaja enhanced the reputation of Mysore as a model state. . . In 1903 Fraser went to the Foreign Department at Calcutta and Simla as deputy secretary and later officiating. secretary. In the following year Lord Curzon sent him to Peking as H.M. Commissioner to negotiate with the Chinese Government about the Anglo-Tibetan Convention of that year. In 1905 he returned to Mysore as Resident and ex-officio Chief_ Commissioner of the small province of Coorg. in 1911 Fraser was appointed Resident in Kashmir. In Srinagar, as elsewhere, Fraser was on terms of warm friendship with the ruler and steadily encouraged progress and reform. For a few months in the summer of 1914 Fraser acted as Resident in Hyderabad. Almost at the outset of the war Turkey was drawn to the German side, which had a serious effect upon Mushm subjects of the Crown, and not least in India. The Nizam of Hyderabad took a defeatist view, and it was only the firm and confident persuasiveness of the acting Resident which led him to recog- nize how fatal would be the effect if he failed to follow the traditions of his father as friend and helper of the British Raj At the three important Residencies he occupied Fraser was greatly assisted by the comradeship and understanding help of his wife, Constance, daughter of Colonel Edwin Maude, whom he married in 1888 and who died in 1937. She was made C.B.E. in 1918 for war work in Hyderabad. They had a son and two daughters. Anglo-Tibetan Convention 1904 In 1903 Fraser went to the Foreign Department at Calcutta and Simla as deputy secretary and in 1904 was sent by Lord Curzon as H.M Commissioner to negotiate with the Chinese about the Anglo-Tibetan Convention (requiring Tibet to open its border with British India). Later career Fraser returned to India in 1905 as Resident in Mysore and Chief Commissioner of Coorg. In 1911 Fraser was appointed Resident in Kashmir and for several months in 1914 was acting Resident in Hyderabad. At the commencement of the First World War, with Turkey taking the side of Germany, it was Fraser’s resolute and confident approach that persuaded Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, the Nizam of Hyderabad, to resist defeatist view and ensure continued support for the British Raj. Fraser Town, Bangalore, India Fraser Town is a suburb of Bangalore Cantonment, in Bangalore North-East, spread over 4 km2.

He was a topographer for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in the Snoqualmie Ranger District between 1897 and 1907. Then, from 1908 to 1931, he served the United States Forest Service as the first forest supervisor of Wenatchee National Forest. His work involved the first detailed surveying and mapping of large portions of the Cascade Range in Washington, over the course of which he gave names to over 1,000 natural features. The surveying work often required placing cairns and other survey targets on top of mountains. He made the first ascents of a number of mountains in Washington. Over the course of his career he explored areas previously unknown to non-indigenous people. One such area, which Sylvester discovered, explored, and named, is The Enchantments. In 1944, while leading a party of friends to one of his favorite parts of the mountains, Sylvester was mortally wounded when his horse panicked and lost his footing on a steep and rocky slope. He once wrote that of all the many places he had explored and visited in the Cascades he thought the most beautiful was the Buck Creek area, near Buck Creek Pass at the crest of the Cascades in northeast Chelan County. Buck Creek flows southeast to the Chiwawa River. A search on \\"Buck Creek\\". Place naming Albert H. Sylvester named over 1,000—perhaps as many as 3,000 natural features in the Cascade Range, including Enchantment Lakes, Dishpan Gap, Lake Margaret, Lake Mary, Lake Florence, Lake Flora, Kodak Peak, the \\"Poets' Ridge\\" peaks Irving, Poe, Longfellow, Bryant, and Whittier. Of the Enchantment Lakes area, now a very popular backpacking destination known as The Enchantments, he wrote, \\"it was an enchanting scene. I named the group Enchantment Lakes.\\" During his career the region between Snoqualmie Pass and the North Cascades, where he did most of his work, was frequently updated with new maps showing the results of ongoing USGS and Forest Service surveying and exploring. This made it possible for Sylvester's place names to become well established and used. His prolific place naming was due in part to Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest Service. During the Pinchot era national forests were relatively new and often largely unmapped and lacking in place names. In order to better protect the forests from wildfire it was necessary to have names for natural features and detailed maps so that fires could be located by name and fire fighters sent to the right places. In regions like the Wenatchee National Forest there were a large number of unnamed features. Significant parts of the mountains were essentially unexplored, except by Native Americans and, in some areas, prospectors, who tended to be secretive about their discoveries. Thus Sylvester found himself exploring and mapping a large region with relatively few established names and what amounted to a mandate to bestow names. Sylvester described his experience: I didn't contact the habit [place naming] very intensely in the survey [USGS]... Coming into the Forest Service and finding that in fire protection work it was very desirable, even imperative, that the natural features capable of being named should have names as an aid in locating fire and sending in crews to combat them, I began place-naming more diligently. Sylvester's place names are scattered over much of the central and northern Cascades in Washington. They are particularly dense in the Wenatchee Mountains, Entiat Mountains, Chelan Mountains, and the Glacier Peak area, today's Glacier Peak Wilderness. In some river basins, such as the Chiwawa River, Little Wenatchee River, White River, and Entiat River basins, nearly every stream and peak was named by Sylvester. His naming was often creative, patterned, sometimes practical and descriptive, sometimes whimsical. Examples of patterned place naming include Aurora Creek and Borealis Ridge, Choral and Anthem Creeks (\\"singing streams\\"), all in the upper Entiat valley; the three \\"baking powder creeks\\", Royal, Crescent, and Schilling Creeks, named for then- popular brands of baking powder; the \\"American poets' peaks Bryant Peak (for William Cullen Bryant), Irving Peak (for Washington Irving), Longfellow Mountain (Henry Wadsworth Longfellow), Poe Mountain (for Edgar Allan Poe), and Whittier Peak (for John Greenleaf Whittier). He named Indian Pass and Indian Creek for the ancient Indian trail over the pass, and in association he named nearby Indian Head Peak and Papoose Creek, a tributary of Indian Creek. Near Indian Creek he named Kloochman Creek and Tillicum Creek, Chinook Jargon terms for wife and friend, \\"figuring that an Indian should have both a wife and a friend\\". Labyrinth Mountain was named for the appearance of its complex contour lines on a map, and in association Sylvester named Minotaur and Theseus Lakes on the mountain. He named Mount David and Mount Jonathan, close to one another, and Mount Saul across Indian Creek valley from them, as in Biblical history Saul being close to but forever separated from David and Jonathan. His whimsical and unusual names are among those most remarked upon. Overcoat Peak was given its name because when Sylvester climbed the mountain in 1897 to build a survey target cairn he left his overcoat, which had proven too small for comfort, buttoned around the cairn. Dirtyface Peak was named for its discolored snow banks due to rapid spring melting. Dishpan Gap was named after he found an old rusty dishpan there. Fifth of July Mountain simply denotes the day Sylvester visited the area, but stands in contrast to a number of Fourth of July place names in the region. Kodak Peak was named for a Kodak camera his assistant Willett Ramsdell lost there. Pass-No-Pass was given its name because, in Sylvester's words, \\"the pass has neither road nor trail, and is suited only for driving sheep from one range to another\\". Some of his names honor specific people, famous or obscure. For example, Mount Fernow (the highest peak in the Entiat Mountains) for Bernhard Fernow, Mount Maude for Frederick Stanley Maude, Harding Mountain for then-president Warren G. Harding, Big Jim Mountains for James J. Hill, Cool Creek for the prospector Thomas Cool, Carne Mountain for the English clergyman W. Stanely Carnes, Estes Butte for an old settler with mining claims there, Lake Jason for Forest Ranger Jason P. Williams; McCall Mountain for Lieut. J. K. McCall, U.S. Army, who was involved in Washington Territory's Indian Wars of 1858 (Sylvester renamed this peak because he felt its earlier name, Huckleberry Mountain, was too common); Phelps Creek and Phelps Ridge for a prospector. He even named Klone Peak after his dog Klone. In naming lakes Sylvester began a tradition, continued by many others, of naming lakes for women. Examples include Lake Alice, for his wife; Lake Margaret and Lake Mary for the sisters of ranger Brune Canby, and Lake Florence for a friend of the Canby sisters; Lake Augusta, for his mother; Ethel Lake, for the wife of Forest Service Ranger Frank Lenzie; Lake Ida, for his sister-in-law; Josephine Lake, for the wife of ranger Jason Williams; Lake Edna, for the sweetheart of a forest ranger; Lake Flora, for the wife of ranger Otto Green; Lake Grace, for the wife of Charles Haydon with whom Sylvester was exploring; Lake Lorraine, for the wife of Assistant Supervisor C. J. Conover; and Loch Eileen, for the daughter of ranger Jason Williams. In some cases his reason for giving a certain name is not obvious from the name alone. Candy Creek in the upper Entiat valley, was named for its sweet taste, but nearby Cool Creek was named for the prospector Thomas Cool. Cardinal Peak was not named for the bird but for its \\"supremacy among adjacent mountains\\"—it is the highest peak of the Chelan Mountains. He named Crook Mountain for the Army officer George Crook who served in the Washington Cascades in 1858 and later in the Civil War as a general. In the case of Crook Mountain Sylvester did not name so much as rename—the peak had been known as Goat Mountain, but Sylvester thought there were \\"more Goat Mountains than goats in the Northwest\\". Sylvester did not have a horse die on Deadhorse Pass but rather used the term given by sheepmen who used the pass. Garland Peak and Garland Creek were named for a man who grazed sheep in the area. Grindstone Mountain was named in association with Grindstone Creek, in which Sylvester found a small grindstone which had fallen from a pack horse fording the creek. Lake Sally Ann, near Dishpan Gap, appears to be another lake named for a specific woman, but Sylvester invented the name, saying \\"the name seemed to fit like a hand in a glove\\". Tinpan Mountain was given its name for no reason. Sylvester said \\"it was just a name for a place needing naming\\". Other notable places named by Sylvester include Seven Fingered Jack, Fortress Mountain, Tumwater Canyon, Jove Peak, Flower Dome, Dome Peak, Ladies Pass, Lake Valhalla, Napeequa River (previously known as the North Fork White River), Natopac Mountain, Pinnacle Mountain, Rampart Mountain, Rock Mountain, Round Mountain, Spanish Camp Creek, Wenatchee Pass and White Pass (named after the Wenatchee River and White River).Details on places named by Sylvester from A \\"Keyword search Request\\" on \\"Sylvester\\" returns over 200 results. Mountaineering Albert H. Sylvester climbed many mountains in the Cascades, often for surveying purposes. Many of his climbs were first ascents. In 1897 and 1898, working as a surveyor for the USGS, Sylvester made a number of first ascents. These included, in 1897, Mount Baring, White Chuck Mountain, Columbia Peak, Overcoat Peak, and Sahale Peak. And in 1898, Snoqualmie Mountain, Gardner Mountain, Star Peak, and Reynolds Peak. These ascents were mainly for the purpose of setting up cairns, poles, and other survey targets for triangulation purposes. In some cases others may have made an earlier, unrecorded ascent. Fred Beckey writes that Sylvester made the \\"apparent first ascent\\" of Sahale Peak, \\"probably the first\\" ascent of Columbia Peak, and that Snoqualmie Mountain may have been ascended for a railroad survey in 1867 and an earlier USGS survey party may have reached the summit earlier in the 1890s.Washington's Highest Mountains - First Ascent Chronology, Rhinoclimbs.com Death Cup Lake and Deadhorse Pass. In September 1944 Sylvester took three friends on a trip into the mountains. They had two pack horses in addition to a saddle horse for each traveler. Their trip went up Chiwaukum Creek to Lake Chiwaukum, then on to Larch Lake, Ewing Basin, and Cup Lake. From Cup Lake the trail grew rough and steep. They continued over Deadhorse Pass and south to the vicinity of Snowgrass Mountain. While pausing at a high point between Lake Mary and Lake Florence Sylvester's horse panicked and ran off the trail bucking. One of the pack horses was lashed to the horn of Sylvester's saddle and the rope caught his leg, holding him in the saddle as both horses fell down a steep and rocky slope. The accident left Sylvester seriously injured. Rescuers carried him out of the mountains. He was taken to a hospital in Wenatchee, but within a week he had died of his injuries. Legacy In addition to the many place names established by Sylvester there are places named for him. After his death friends requested that Snowgrass Mountain be renamed for Sylvester but the request was denied. Sylvester Lake, southwest of the mountain, was the alternate idea. The lake is located at the head of Grindstone Creek near Alice Lake, which Sylvester had named for his wife. A creek on the upper Green River in King County was renamed from Forsythe Creek to Sylvester Creek by Professor A.H. Landes of the University of Washington in honor of Albert H. Sylvester.

Career Heaven, a London nightclub, in November 2011 Named after the Italian design company, Alessi Laurent-Marke grew up in Hammersmith, London where her father, Alan Marke, is a television producer who has worked on TV shows such as Modern Toss, Snuff Box and Shooting Stars and is also the managing director of TV production company Channel X. She first became interested in music when her mother gave her a copy of Graham Nash's 1971 album Songs for Beginners. She took up the drums at the age of 11 when her secondary school required students to take up an instrument, her choice inspired by seeing drummer Meg White perform with the White Stripes at a concert at Alexandra Palace. Her drum teacher played locally in different bands and through this she began going to see him and various bands live with her dad, sometimes going to as many as four shows a week. This led to her starting her own fanzine called Brain Bulletin (which now continues in the form of a blog) in which she wrote about her favourite bands, books and films. Inspired by a family friend in New York, who wrote a fanzine called The Curse, she distributed it at concerts, through a local record shop and at a launderette on Shepherd's Bush Road. As part of the coursework for her music GCSE she had to compose the music and lyrics for a song. Through the basic chords she had learnt fooling around on her sister's guitar and \\"the combination of the poetry and the stories that I had been writing for my fanzine\\" she composed the song Glendora (which eventually ended up on her debut album), which her music teacher encouraged her to sing at the school assembly. Discovering a new passion for writing and performing, she decided to leave school to pursue music at age 16. Although supported by her parents, she promised them that she would return to school after one year if nothing came of it. During this time she quickly gained a following with her demos posted on her MySpace and self-released an EP called Bedroom Bound that she sold through her page (on her independent label Zooey). To avoid confusion with the music act the Alessi Brothers, her mother suggested calling herself Alessi's Ark: \\"I liked the idea of a boat, where everybody is welcome, even friends that are geographically far away – we are together.\\" Booking as many shows as she could and playing \\"anywhere\\", representatives from record labels Heavenly Records and EMI soon saw her performing and offered her a deal. On the eve of her 17th birthday she signed to Virgin Records, a division of EMI. Asked who her dream producer would be for her major label debut, Laurent-Marke said Mike Mogis, producer of Rilo Kiley and member of Bright Eyes. She met up with him in London after a Bright Eyes show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in early 2008 and travelled to Nebraska to record the album at Mogis' and Conor Oberst's studio in Omaha. The resulting album, Notes From The Treehouse, was released in May 2009, featuring full band versions of some of the songs from her Bedroom Bound EP, as well as newer compositions such as The Dog and Hummingbird. The album also featured many musicians that inspired her to begin making music including Jake Bellows of Neva Dinova and Nate Walcott from Bright Eyes. Following the release of the album, Alessi's Ark continued to play live around the UK and also played support to a diverse range of artists such as Laura Marling, Mariee Sioux, Emilíana Torrini and Cerys Matthews, as well as playing the Bandstand stage at Neil Young's Hyde Park show in London in June. Riverside Studios in Hammersmith also played host to an exhibition of her drawings inspired by her songs, called Handmade, which ran from 20 August to 27 September 2009. In February 2010, Alessi's Ark left Virgin and signed with independent label Bella Union. Her first release on Bella Union was an EP called Soul Proprietor which was released on 5 April 2010. On 25 April 2011 she released her second album Time Travel. which was recorded in Brighton's Electric Studios with Willkommen Collective's Marcus Hamblett and at Bryn Derwen in Wales with David Wrench. The album was well received by critics and fans alike with the BBC's review calling it an album that \\"sails well above the current flood of increasingly desperate folk wannabes, and weaves a modest magic that is hard to pinpoint, yet even harder to resist\\" and The Guardian writing that the songs on Time Travel \\"reveal a talent that's on the verge of becoming something special\\". The live shows in support of the album saw Alessi's Ark once again joining Laura Marling on her US tour in September 2011. In March 2012, Laurent-Marke made an appearance singing vocals on the debut release by Young Colossus, a limited edition six song soundtrack by Orlando Weeks (The Maccabees) and producer Nic Nell, which came with a 24-page illustrated picture book, and was available exclusively through the band's website. She later made a live appearance with Young Colossus for a one-off show at Corsica Studios in Elephant & Castle, London on 5 September 2012. Alessi's Ark's debut album, Notes from the Treehouse, was also released in the US on 18 September 2012, preceded by a competition to design a new cover for the album which was won by Evalie Wagner. The third album from Alessi's Ark, The Still Life, was released on 15 April 2013 on Bella Union records. The album was produced by Andy LeMaster and recorded in Athens, Georgia and by Nic Nell in London. Alessi released her fourth album Love is the Currency on 27 October 2017 and toured in the U.S, Japan and Europe in 2018.

Content The longest of the stories is also called Half a Life and tells the story of a Russian woman kidnapped by an alien spacecraft in the years following the second world war. In a distant, but unspecified future, human cosmonauts discover the alien ship floating in space, a derelict. Entering the ship, they soon realize that it was automated - run by robots with the apparent mission of collecting biologic specimens from different planets. (The purpose of this exploration remains undetermined, but one of the humans speculate that it may have been a lucky break for mankind that the ship never returned home.) One of the cosmonauts finds bits of a journal written in Russian, a diary of life aboard the spacecraft written by the abducted Russian woman, the ship's sole human occupant. Compiling the journal, the cosmonauts learn of the human author's attempts to bond with the ship's other intelligent specimens, and of their plot to escape the ship's crew of automatons. When the cosmonauts find the journal incomplete, they are forced to learn for themselves the fate of the author. In I Was the First to Find You, the crew of the Earth ship Spartak have spent years on a deep space expedition. As Spartak flew at interstellar speeds, the gap of time between her departure and return was even greater on Earth, and her crew are forced to consider whether they have wasted their lives away. In Protest, a famous former athlete is forced to mediate a dispute in an interplanetary Olympics competition. In Red Deer, White Deer, human explorers discover a world having reached a state comparable to Earth's at the dawn of mankind. Fate however, has this world taking a different path. In May I Please Speak to Nina, the narrator has been trying to reach his girlfriend Nina by phone. Instead, he keeps reaching another Nina, one who thinks that she is in the 1940s, as the Soviet Union is besieged by war. For the narrator, it is the 1970s. Perhaps the girl is playing a trick, or is actually a demented old woman for whom time has lost its meaning. The narrator, with his own bitter memories of that time, cannot discard the possibility that his phone has somehow crossed wires through time. In Snowmaiden, human cosmonauts discover the beautiful survivor of a destroyed spaceship from another world. Despite incompatible physiologies, love blooms between the alien \\"snowmaiden\\" and one of her rescuers.

Background Bold was a dark bay horse bred by his owners, the Virginia-based Brookmeade Stable. He was sired by the 1944 American Champion Three-Year-Old Colt By Jimminy out of the mare Little Rebel. Little Rebel was a daughter of the broodmare Warrior Lass, whose other descendants include the Kentucky Derby winner Riva Ridge and the Belmont Stakes winner Bounding Home. Racing career Bold did not run in the Kentucky Derby and did not appear as a three-year-old until ten days before the Preakness Stakes. He ran twice at Pimlico Race Course winning once and then finishing second by a neck to Alerted in the Preakness Prep over eight and a half furlongs The Kentucky Derby winner Count Turf had not been entered in the Preakness and Bold, ridden for the first time by Eddie Arcaro, started second favourite at 4.1/1 behind the Greentree Stable entry which comprised Big Stretch and Hall of Fame. The colt was equipped with a set of asymmetrical blinkers which blocked the vision in his right eye to prevent him drifting away from the rail. Arcaro sent Bold into the lead shortly after the start and after being briefly headed by Counterpoint he opened up a clear lead. Bold turned into the stretch three lengths clear of his rivals and steadily increased his advantage to win by seven lengths from Counterpoint, with Alerted third. The win, which gave Arcaro a record fourth win in the race, reportedly attracted the biggest ever television audience for a horse race up to that time. Bold suffered from bucked shins after the Preakness, and after finishing a well-beaten third to Count Turf in the Polynesian Purse at Belmont Park he was withdrawn from the Belmont Stakes. Bold returned to the racecourse in July to win the Saranac Handicap at Jamaica Race Course, leading all the way on a muddy to track to win by a length from Loridale. Death Bold's problems with bucked shins recurred during the early part of 1952. He was rested in Virginia before resuming his 4-year-old campaign in Saratoga where he ran twice without success. He was struck by lightning and killed on the evening of July 9–10, 1952 while in an outdoor training paddock.

He was killed at Deason Home. Introduction and ancestry McLemore was born on August 23, 1823, probably in Simpson or Copiah County, Mississippi.Ole Rosinheels: A Genealogical Sketch of the Family of Major Amos McLemore, 27th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, C.S.A., by Rudy Leverett., University of Southern Mississippi, page 69. He was the oldest son of John and Anna Maria McLemore. The McLemore family had been established in the South for nearly two hundred years. The patriarchs and matriarchs of the American McLemore family were James and Abraham McLemore, who probably were brothers, and Fortune (Gilliam) McLemore, James's wife. James arrived in America, probably from Scotland, not later than March 1, 1691.Ole Rosinheels: A Genealogical Sketch of the Family of Major Amos McLemore, 27th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, C.S.A., by Rudy Leverett, University of Southern Mississippi, page 37. The name McLemore derives from the Gaelic patronymic Macghillemhuire (the spelling of which has varied from writer to writer and from time to time in Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and North America).Ole Rosinheels: A Genealogical Sketch of the Family of Major Amos McLemore, 27th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, C.S.A., by Rudy Leverett, University of Southern Mississippi, page 1. The name means \\"son of a servant or devotee of the Virgin Mary\\" and originated among the Celto-Norse people (Norse-Gaels) who populated the lands bordering the Irish and Hebridean seas.Ole Rosinheels: A Genealogical Sketch of the Family of Major Amos McLemore, 27th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, C.S.A., by Rudy Leverett, University of Southern Mississippi, pages 1, 15. Life McLemore opposed Southern secession from the Union though his business partner, Dr. J.M. Bayliss, supported it. Nevertheless, once invasion from the North seemed inevitable McLemore volunteered to raise a company for the Confederate States Army. It was mustered into Confederate service in Ellisville as Company B, 7th Battalion, 27th Mississippi Volunteer Infantry Regiment, on September 10, 1861, with Mclemore as its Captain. Company B, known as the Rosin Heels, was \\"the second [company] among eight raised in the area that consisted of all, or significant numbers of Jones County men.\\"Leverett, Rudy H., Legend of the Free State of Jones, University Press of Mississippi, 1984, pages 65–68. On March 16, 1863, McLemore was promoted to Major and placed third in command of the Regiment. In spite of pre-War opposition to secession and the number of \\"transient deserters\\", the activities of such formerly anti-secessionist individuals as McLemore, according to historian (and descendant of McLemore) Rudy H. Leverett, along with the facts \\"that virtually every able-bodied man in the county was on active duty in organizations such as those commanded by McLemore … and that the Union raiding party entering the county in June 1863 was captured by civilians, and the Union prisoners had to be protected from the local citizens\\" present evidence that the citizens of Jones County were loyal to the Confederacy. Death One of these deserters and his followers killed Major McLemore October 5, 1863, while McLemore was dispatched temporarily from the Atlanta, GA area back to Jones County to round up deserters who had returned there and to recruit any new individuals he could. McLemore, a guest of State Representative Amos Deason at his home on the outskirts of Ellisville, spent the afternoon and evening of that cold, rainy, October day in conversation with Deason and others in the parlor of the small 4-room house.Leverett, Rudy H., Legend of the Free State of Jones, University Press of Mississippi, 1984, page 64. The leader of a number of the resident deserters, Newton Knight, reputedly shot McLemore in the back as he prepared for bed, killing him in order to prevent him from ordering the deaths of ex- Confederate deserters.https://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/free-state- of-jones/ References Category:1823 births Category:1863 deaths Category:People from Jones County, Mississippi Category:American Methodists Category:Deaths by firearm in Mississippi Category:19th-century Methodist ministers Category:Confederate States Army officers Category:People of Mississippi in the American Civil War ","title":"Amos McLemore"},{"id":"24050725","text":"Much of the trail is of original Inca construction The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu (also known as Camino Inca or Camino Inka) is a hiking trail in Peru that terminates at Machu Picchu. It consists of three overlapping trails: Mollepata, Classic, and One Day. Mollepata is the longest of the three routes with the highest mountain pass and intersects with the Classic route before crossing Warmiwañusqa (\\"dead woman\\"). Located in the Andes mountain range, the trail passes through several types of Andean environments including cloud forest and alpine tundra. Settlements, tunnels, and many Incan ruins are located along the trail before ending the terminus at the Sun Gate on Machu Picchu mountain. The two longer routes require an ascent to beyond above sea level, which can result in altitude sickness. Concern about overuse leading to erosion has led the Peruvian government to place a limit on the number of people who may hike this trail per season, and to sharply limit the companies that can provide guides. As a result, advance booking is mandatory. A maximum of 500 people are allowed on the trail each day, of which only 200 are trekkers, the rest being guides and porters. Responsible People As a result, the high season books out very quickly. The trail is closed every February for cleaning. This was originally done informally by organizations such as South American Explorers, South American Explorer, No. 7, December 1980 but is now managed officially.  Classic trail  Patallacta viewed from above Trekkers normally take four or five days to complete the \\"Classic Inca Trail\\" but a two-day trek from Km 104 is also possible.Explore the Inca Trail, p. 50 It starts from one of two points: 88 km (55 miles) or 82 km (51 miles) from Cusco on the Urubamba River at approximately or elevation, respectively.

(sometimes called Llaqtapata), a site used for religious and ceremonial functions, crop production, and housing for soldiers from the nearby hilltop site of Willkaraqay, an ancient pre-Inca site first inhabited around 500 BC. The trail undulates, but overall ascends along the Kusichaka River. At the small village Wayllapampa (\\"grassy plain\\", Wayllabamba) the trail intersects with the \\"Mollepata Trail\\" at . Small, permanent settlements are located adjacent to the trail, and Wayllapampa has approximately 400 inhabitants (130 families) spread along this portion of the trail. Pack animals—horses, mules, donkeys, and llamas—are allowed. At Wayllapampa the trail to Machu Picchu turns west and begins ascending along a tributary of the Kusichaka. Because of previous damage caused by hooves, pack animals are not allowed on the remainder of the trail. For the same reason, metal-tipped trekking poles are not allowed on the trail. Inca Trail cloud forest Ascent to Warmi Wañusqa As the trail ascends toward Warmi Wañusqa, or \\"Dead Woman's Pass\\", which resembles a supine woman, it passes through differing habitats, one of which is a cloud forest containing Polylepis trees. The campsite at Llulluch'apampa (Llulluchapampa) is located on this stretch of trail at . The pass itself is located at above sea level, and is the highest point on this, the \\"Classic\\" trail. After crossing the pass the trail drops steeply into the Pakaymayu drainage. At a distance of 2.1 km and 600 m below the pass is the campground Pakaymayu. tambo Runkuraqay After passing Pakaymayu the trail begins steeply ascending the other side of the valley. One kilometre along the trail, at an elevation of is the Inca tampu Runkuraqay, ruins which overlook the valley. The site was heavily restored in the late 1990s. The trail continues to ascend, passing a small lake named Quchapata (Cochapata)Cuzco Region Machu Picchu – Peru.

As with other sites that were being degraded due to overuse, camping is no longer allowed. The trail reaches the pass at an elevation of 3950 m. The trail continues through high cloud forest, undulating, sometimes steeply while affording increasingly dramatic viewpoints of mountains and dropoffs. Next, the Sayaqmarka (\\"steep-place town\\") is reached followed by the tampu Qunchamarka.

The Fejos team named the site, and uncovered the remainder. Design of the site closely follows the natural contours, and includes five fountains and an altar, which was probably used for llama sacrifice.Explore the Inca Trail, p. 52 The trail then descends approximately 1000 metres including an irregular staircase of approximately 1500 steps, some of which were carved into solid granite. Vegetation becomes more dense, lush, and jungle-like with an accompanying increase in butterflies and birds. A second Inca tunnel is along this section of trail.Explore the Inca Trail, p. 53. Intipata Even before passing through the tunnel there are views down to the Willkanuta River, the first since leaving the river at Patallaqta. The number of these views increases. After the tunnel the town of Machupicchu (Aguas Calientes) can be seen, and trains running along the river can be heard. As the trail nears Intipata, it affords views of the \\"Two Day\\" Inca Trail (aka \\"Camino Real de los Inkas\\" or \\"One Day Inca Trail\\"). A small spur of the trail leads directly to Wiñay Wayna, while the main route continues to Intipata. Intipata (aka Yunkapata) is a recently uncovered extensive set of agricultural terraces which follow the convex shape of the terrain. Potatoes, maize, fruit, and sweet potato were grown here. Wiñaywayna, showing upper and lower structures The name Wiñay Wayna (forever young) (win-yay-way-na) is used to refer to both a hostel–restaurant–camp site and a set of Inca ruins. Two groups of major architectural structures, a lower and upper, are set among multiple agricultural terraces at this concave mountainside site. A long flight of fountains or ritual baths utilizing as many as 19 springs runs between the two groups of buildings. From Wiñay Wayna the trail undulates along below the crest of the east slope of the mountain named Machu Picchu. The steep stairs leading to Inti Punku (\\"sun gate\\") are reached after approximately 3 km. Reaching the crest of this ridge reveals the grandeur of the ruins of Machu Picchu, which lie below. A short downhill walk is the final section of the trail.The Rough Guide to Peru. Dilwyn Jenkins. Contributor Dilwyn Jenkins. Rough Guides. 2003. page 169. ,  Inca Trail Permits  Because of its popularity, the Peruvian Government instituted several controls to reduce human impact upon the trail and within the ancient city. The most notable is a quota system, introduced in 2001, whereby only a set number of people (including hikers, porters, and guides) would be allowed to hike along the Inca Trail each day. This system is still in effect; any person wishing to hike the Inca Trail must obtain a permit beforehand. , 500 permits are issued for each day. All of the year's permits are released in October and are sold on a first-come, first-served basis. Permits were previously released in January, however, in 2017 this changed to October. Permits sell out quickly, particularly those for the high season. Most operators advise hikers to purchase permits as soon as possible after they are released. The government also mandated that every trekker on the trail must be accompanied by a guide. Because of this rule, permits can only be obtained through a government registered tour operator. All permits are paired with an individual passport and are not transferable. The government monitors the trail closely; there are several control points along the trail.  Inca Trail Elevation  Inca Trail Elevation Graph The Inca Trail elevation varies significantly and people often struggle with altitude sickness, especially if they have not spent much time in Cusco before trekking the trail. Cusco stands at 3,200 metres and is already significantly higher than Machu Picchu itself, though many sections of the Inca Trail are much higher. Starting at 2,600 metres, the trail ascends to 3,300 metres on the first day. The second day ascends over Dead Woman's pass- the highest point on the Inca Trail at 4,200 metres. This is the most dangerous point for altitude sickness, though little time is spent at this elevation and the trail descends again to 3,600 metres. The trail only descends from this point until arriving at Machu Picchu at 2,430 metres.

The title, inspired by the author André Gide is taken from an Arab proverb: \\"The dogs bark, but the caravan moves on.\\" Reception and critical analysis Lis Harris when writing for The New Yorker said: \\"Capote describes these pieces as \\"silhouettes and souvenirs\\" and \\"a written geography of my life\\"—a somewhat diaphanous description, but, like most of Capote's nonfiction writing, completely apt. The title is taken from an Arab proverb: \\"The dogs bark but the caravan moves on\\" (Gide to Capote one day in Tangiers when Capote was grumbling about a bad review), and most of the pieces are about people and places Capote has observed while moving on since 1942. Though large and covering a long period of time, this book is innocent of political or social opinions of any sort; if Capote has any, he has always kept them out of his writing; and there is a certain shallowness to the collection because of it. It bulges, however, with sharp, subtle observations of people, fascinating reminiscences and travel jottings, wonderful sketches, anecdotes and yarns, and, among other things, the most frightening horror story you've ever heard.

On 14 September 1899, he married Elizabeth Jane Maginness, the daughter of John Maginness. They were to have one son and four daughters. Jones first farmed in Weedons near Rolleston. In 1909–1910, he farmed in the Waikato. Next, he farmed in Dunsandel. Apart from the two years in the Waikato, all his farming was in Canterbury. Public roles Jones was one of the instigators of the New Zealand Farmers Union, which eventually developed into Federated Farmers. On three occasions, he was the president of the North Canterbury branch. He belonged to the Wheat Board and, after World War I, the Repatriation Board. He was the chairman of the parliamentary committee that recommended the establishment of the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, and when it was established in 1922, he was appointed as its first chairman. He remained in that role until 1931 and outside his parliamentary activities, this is what he was best known for. He resigned from the position when he was appointed to cabinet. Soon afterwards, he failed to get re-elected in the , so he resumed his role as chairman of the Meat Producers Board and held it until 1935. He represented the Meat Producers Board at the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference in Ottawa, Canada. His 1935 resignation came about because he was appointed as member of the Commission of Agriculture. Political career Forbes Coalition Ministry in 1931, including Jones (back left) He first stood for election to Parliament in the electorate in the . Of the five candidates, he came third and since the Second Ballot Act was in force, he did not proceed to the second ballot. He was beaten by William Nosworthy and Frederick Flatman, and was only 30 votes behind Nosworthy. On election night when the results were published, Jones was ahead of Nosworthy, who encouraged his supporters to vote for Jones in the second ballot. After a recount, the situation was reversed and Jones advertised for his supporters to vote for Nosworthy, and indeed, Nosworthy was successful in the second ballot. The next parliamentary election that Jones contested was in in the electorate. David Buddo had been the incumbent for the Liberal Party since , plus an earlier term starting in , and Jones failed to unseat him; Buddo had a majority of close to 20% of the votes. Jones contested the Kaiapoi electorate again in the . It was a three-way contest, with Morgan Williams standing for the recently formed Labour Party as the other candidate apart from the incumbent. Jones won by a wafer-thin majority of 50 votes (0.75%). The same three candidates contested the . This time, the situation was reversed, with Buddo having a lean majority over the incumbent, Jones, of 65 votes (0.89%). In the , Jones stood in the electorate. Since , Ellesmere had been held by Heaton Rhodes, who also represented the Reform Party. Rhodes retired in 1925 on medical advice. The other candidate in Ellesmere was Jeremiah Connolly for the Liberal Party (who, in that year, contested the election under the label 'National Party'). Jones had a comfortable majority of 634 votes (8.57%). In the 1927 Electoral Redistribution, the Ellesmere electorate was abolished and most of its area went to the new Mid-Canterbury electorate. This change first applied at the , when four candidates contested the electorate: Jones for Reform, Connolly for United, Williams for Labour, and a farmer from Mount Hutt, Robert Wallace Wightman, as an Independent. Nationally, there was a significant swing towards the United Party, who had developed from the Liberal Party, at this election, and Jones once again had a very slim majority, beating Connolly by only 55 votes (0.59%). In September 1931, just prior to the next election, Jones was appointed to Cabinet by George Forbes as Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Mines. The election was contested by three of the four previous candidates (Williams stood in Kaiapoi instead and was successful), and Hiram Hunter joined as an Independent Labour candidate. Connolly, who stood and an Independent Liberal that year, had a majority of 136 votes (1.46%) over Jones and was returned. There was widespread surprise and regret expressed in New Zealand over Jones having lost the election, and having lost one of the more able cabinet ministers. Jones did not contest the . In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Family and death The Jones had five children: Violet Irene (born 1900), Ellen Adele (born 1902), Millicent Eileen (born 1904), Hilda Gracey (born 1906), and David Ralston (born 1908). For a time, the Jones family lived in the Christchurch suburb of Bryndwr. Approximately in 1935, Jones and his wife moved to Wellington where they lived at 23 Main Road (Wadestown Road) in the suburb of Wadestown. His wife died on 17 August 1937 and is buried at Karori Cemetery. Jones retired in January 1940 and died on 23 September 1941 in a private hospital in Wellington. His pall-bearers were all fellow ex- cabinet ministers: Gordon Coates, George Forbes, Adam Hamilton, Bill Endean, Jack Massey, and Bert Kyle. He was survived by his five children and is buried next to his wife.

Atractocarpus fitzalanii grows as a woody shrub or small tree some in height. The trunk is covered by smooth grey bark. The large glossy dark green leaves are obovate to oval-shaped and range from long by wide. The yellowish veins and midrib are prominent on the leaf. The new growth is a bright lime green in colour. The small (2-2.5 cm or 1 inch) white fragrant flowers appear from September to November, occur singly and have five lanceolate petals around a tube. The round- or oval-shaped fruit is 3–4 cm in diameter and ripens in April to June. The fragrance of the flowers resembles that of the common gardenia, and fruit can be eaten fresh. Distribution and habitat The range is from far north Queensland south through to Mackay. It is found in rainforests and sheltered habitats. Ecology Flowers open in the afternoon, and moths then visit the plants. Birds eat the fruit.  Uses  Its bushy lush foliage and bright new growth, fragrant flowers and edible and tasty fruit give it horticultural potential in gardens in subtropical climates. It is suited to a shady position with good drainage in gardens, or moderately to brightly lit indoor spaces.

After a year he enrolled in what was then the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute, in which he studied logic and psychology. In 1956 having graduated with the highest honours, he became a lecturer at the institute, a post he retained until 1963. As a lecturer he gave a lot of attention to the improvement of the scientific qualification. Attention to philosophical ideas, encouraged him to organise a science doctorate dissertation. For the young scientist in the environment of the time, there were not particularly accommodating conditions for scientific exploration. Pleckaitis was largely influenced by his dissertation supervisor, a scientist and philosopher known throughout Europe- Vosylius Sezeman. He encouraged Pleckaitis to take an interest in the evolution of Lithuanian philosophy. Pleckaitis was particularly interested in scholastic logic. He based his doctorate dissertation on- \\"Scholastic logic and its decline in Lithuania\\" and became the founder of systematic investigation of history of Lithuanian philosophy.

An inertial navigation system (INS) is a navigation device that uses a computer, motion sensors (accelerometers) and rotation sensors (gyroscopes) to continuously calculate by dead reckoning the position, the orientation, and the velocity (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references. Often the inertial sensors are supplemented by a barometric altimeter and occasionally by magnetic sensors (magnetometers) and/or speed measuring devices. INSs are used on mobile robots and on vehicles such as ships, aircraft, submarines, guided missiles, and spacecraft. Other terms used to refer to inertial navigation systems or closely related devices include inertial guidance system, inertial instrument, inertial measurement unit (IMU) and many other variations. Older INS systems generally used an inertial platform as their mounting point to the vehicle and the terms are sometimes considered synonymous. Comparison of accuracy of various navigation systems. The radius of the circle indicates the accuracy. A smaller radius corresponds to a higher accuracy. Overview Inertial navigation is a self-contained navigation technique in which measurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the position and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point, orientation and velocity. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) typically contain three orthogonal rate-gyroscopes and three orthogonal accelerometers, measuring angular velocity and linear acceleration respectively. By processing signals from these devices it is possible to track the position and orientation of a device. Inertial navigation is used in a wide range of applications including the navigation of aircraft, tactical and strategic missiles, spacecraft, submarines and ships. It is also embedded in the mostly nowadays mobile phone for purpose of mobile phone location and tracking Wan Mohd Yaakob Wan Bejuri, Mohd Murtadha Mohamad, Hadri Omar, Farhana Syed Omar and Nurfarah Ain Limin (2019).

An Improved Resampling Scheme for Particle Filtering in Inertial Navigation System. Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Vol. 11432, pp. 555-563,See publication here Recent advances in the construction of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have made it possible to manufacture small and light inertial navigation systems. These advances have widened the range of possible applications to include areas such as human and animal motion capture. An inertial navigation system includes at least a computer and a platform or module containing accelerometers, gyroscopes, or other motion-sensing devices. The INS is initially provided with its position and velocity from another source (a human operator, a GPS satellite receiver, etc.) accompanied with the initial orientation and thereafter computes its own updated position and velocity by integrating information received from the motion sensors. The advantage of an INS is that it requires no external references in order to determine its position, orientation, or velocity once it has been initialized. An INS can detect a change in its geographic position (a move east or north, for example), a change in its velocity (speed and direction of movement) and a change in its orientation (rotation about an axis). It does this by measuring the linear acceleration and angular velocity applied to the system. Since it requires no external reference (after initialization), it is immune to jamming and deception. Inertial navigation systems are used in many different moving objects. However, their cost and complexity place constraints on the environments in which they are practical for use. Gyroscopes measure the angular velocity of the sensor frame with respect to the inertial reference frame. By using the original orientation of the system in the inertial reference frame as the initial condition and integrating the angular velocity, the system's current orientation is known at all times. This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel the car turn left and right or tilt up and down as the car ascends or descends hills. Based on this information alone, the passenger knows what direction the car is facing but not how fast or slow it is moving, or whether it is sliding sideways. Accelerometers measure the linear acceleration of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame, but in directions that can only be measured relative to the moving system (since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system, but are not aware of their own orientation). This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel himself pressed back into his seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down; and feel himself pressed down into his seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as the car passes over the crest of a hill and begins to descend. Based on this information alone, he knows how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself, that is, whether it is accelerating forward, backward, left, right, up (toward the car's ceiling), or down (toward the car's floor) measured relative to the car, but not the direction relative to the Earth, since he did not know what direction the car was facing relative to the Earth when they felt the accelerations. However, by tracking both the current angular velocity of the system and the current linear acceleration of the system measured relative to the moving system, it is possible to determine the linear acceleration of the system in the inertial reference frame. Performing integration on the inertial accelerations (using the original velocity as the initial conditions) using the correct kinematic equations yields the inertial velocities of the system and integration again (using the original position as the initial condition) yields the inertial position. In our example, if the blindfolded passenger knew how the car was pointed and what its velocity was before he was blindfolded and if he is able to keep track of both how the car has turned and how it has accelerated and decelerated since, then he can accurately know the current orientation, position, and velocity of the car at any time. Drift rate All inertial navigation systems suffer from integration drift: small errors in the measurement of acceleration and angular velocity are integrated into progressively larger errors in velocity, which are compounded into still greater errors in position.Inertial navigation systems analysis, Kenneth R. Britting, Wiley-Interscience, 1971. Since the new position is calculated from the previous calculated position and the measured acceleration and angular velocity, these errors accumulate roughly proportionally to the time since the initial position was input. Even the best accelerometers, with a standard error of 10 micro-g, would accumulate a 50-meter error within 17 minutes.Calculated from reversing S=1/2.a.t^2 into t=√(2s/a), where s=distance in meters, a is acceleration (here 9.8 times g), and t is time in seconds. Therefore, the position must be periodically corrected by input from some other type of navigation system. Accordingly, inertial navigation is usually used to supplement other navigation systems, providing a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with the use of any single system. For example, if, in terrestrial use, the inertially tracked velocity is intermittently updated to zero by stopping, the position will remain precise for a much longer time, a so-called zero velocity update. In aerospace particularly, other measurement systems are used to determine INS inaccuracies, e.g. the Honeywell LaseRefV inertial navigation systems uses GPS and air data computer outputs to maintain required navigation performance. The navigation error rises with the lower sensitivity of the sensors used. Currently, devices combining different sensors are being developed, e.g. attitude and heading reference system. Because the navigation error is mainly influenced by the numerical integration of angular rates and accelerations, the Pressure Reference System was developed to use one numerical integration of the angular rate measurements. Estimation theory in general and Kalman filtering in particular,Applied Optimal Estimation, Arthur Gelb (Editor), M.I.T. Press, 1974. provide a theoretical framework for combining information from various sensors. One of the most common alternative sensors is a satellite navigation radio such as GPS, which can be used for all kinds of vehicles with direct sky visibility. Indoor applications can use pedometers, distance measurement equipment, or other kinds of position sensors. By properly combining the information from an INS and other systems (GPS/INS), the errors in position and velocity are stable. Furthermore, INS can be used as a short-term fallback while GPS signals are unavailable, for example when a vehicle passes through a tunnel. In 2011, GPS jamming at the civilian level became a governmental concern. The relative ease in ability to jam these systems has motivated the military to reduce navigation dependence on GPS technology. Inertial navigation sensors cannot be jammed. In 2012, researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory reported an inertial measurement unit consisting of micro-electromechanical system triaxial accelerometers and tri-axial gyroscopes with an array size of 10 that had a Kalman filter algorithm to estimate sensor nuisance parameters (errors) and munition position and velocity. Each array measures six data points and the system coordinates the data together to deliver a navigation solution. If one sensor consistently over or underestimates distance, the system can adjust, adjusting the corrupted sensor's contributions to the final calculation. The addition of the heuristic algorithm reduced a flight's calculated distance error from 120m to 40m from the designated target. The researchers coupled the algorithm with GPS or radar technology to initial and aid the navigation algorithm. At various points during the munition's flight they would cut off tracking and estimate the accuracy of the munition's landing. In a forty-second flight, 10s and 20s availability of aiding demonstrated little difference in error as both were approximately 35m off target. No noticeable difference was observed when experimentation took place with 100 sensor arrays rather than ten. The researchers indicate this limited experimental data signifies an optimization of navigation technology and a potential reduction in cost of military systems. History Inertial navigation systems were originally developed for rockets. American rocketry pioneer Robert Goddard experimented with rudimentary gyroscopic systems. Dr. Goddard's systems were of great interest to contemporary German pioneers including Wernher von Braun. The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of spacecraft, guided missiles, and commercial airliners. Early German World War II V2 guidance systems combined two gyroscopes and a lateral accelerometer with a simple analog computer to adjust the azimuth for the rocket in flight. Analog computer signals were used to drive four graphite rudders in the rocket exhaust for flight control. The GN&C; (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) system for the V2 provided many innovations as an integrated platform with closed loop guidance. At the end of the war von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. They arrived at Fort Bliss, Texas in 1945 under the provisions of Operation Paperclip and were subsequently moved to Huntsville, Alabama, in 1950 where they worked for U.S. Army rocket research programs. In the early 1950s, the US government wanted to insulate itself against over dependency on the German team for military applications, including the development of a fully domestic missile guidance program. The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (later to become the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.) was chosen by the Air Force Western Development Division to provide a self-contained guidance system backup to Convair in San Diego for the new Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile (Construction and testing were completed by Arma Division of AmBosch Arma). The technical monitor for the MIT task was a young engineer named Jim Fletcher who later served as the NASA Administrator. The Atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an on-board autonomous system and a ground-based tracking and command system. The self-contained system finally prevailed in ballistic missile applications for obvious reasons. In space exploration, a mixture of the two remains. In the summer of 1952, Dr. Richard Battin and Dr. J. Halcombe \\"Hal\\" Laning, Jr., researched computational based solutions to guidance and undertook the initial analytical work on the Atlas inertial guidance in 1954. Other key figures at Convair were Charlie Bossart, the Chief Engineer, and Walter Schweidetzky, head of the guidance group. Schweidetzky had worked with von Braun at Peenemünde during World War II. The initial Delta guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory. A velocity to be gained (VGO) calculation is made to correct the current trajectory with the objective of driving VGO to zero. The mathematics of this approach were fundamentally valid, but dropped because of the challenges in accurate inertial guidance and analog computing power. The challenges faced by the Delta efforts were overcome by the Q system (see Q-guidance) of guidance. The Q system's revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance (and associated equations of motion) in the matrix Q. The Q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector. A key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product (v, xdv, /dt) to be used as the basic autopilot rate signals—a technique that became known as cross-product steering. The Q-system was presented at the first Technical Symposium on Ballistic Missiles held at the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in Los Angeles on June 21 and 22, 1956. The Q system was classified information through the 1960s. Derivations of this guidance are used for today's missiles. Guidance in human spaceflight In February 1961 NASA awarded MIT a contract for preliminary design study of a guidance and navigation system for Apollo. MIT and the Delco Electronics Div. of General Motors Corp. were awarded the joint contract for design and production of the Apollo Guidance and Navigation systems for the Command Module and the Lunar Module. Delco produced the IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) for these systems, Kollsman Instrument Corp. produced the Optical Systems, and the Apollo Guidance Computer was built by Raytheon under subcontract (see Apollo on-board guidance, navigation and control system, Dave Hoag, International Space Hall of Fame Dedication Conference in Alamogordo, N.M., October 1976). For the Space Shuttle, open loop (no feedback) guidance was used to guide the Shuttle from lift-off until Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation. After SRB separation the primary Space Shuttle guidance is named PEG (Powered Explicit Guidance). PEG takes into account both the Q system and the predictor- corrector attributes of the original \\"Delta\\" System (PEG Guidance). Although many updates to the Shuttle's navigation system had taken place over the last 30 years (ex. GPS in the OI-22 build), the guidance core of the Shuttle GN&C; system had evolved little. Within a manned system, there is a human interface needed for the guidance system. As astronauts are the customer for the system, many new teams were formed that touch GN&C; as it is a primary interface to \\"fly\\" the vehicle. Aircraft inertial guidance One example of a popular INS for commercial aircraft was the Delco Carousel, which provided partial automation of navigation in the days before complete flight management systems became commonplace. The Carousel allowed pilots to enter 9 waypoints at a time and then guided the aircraft from one waypoint to the next using an INS to determine aircraft position and velocity. Boeing Corporation subcontracted the Delco Electronics Div. of General Motors to design and build the first production Carousel systems for the early models (-100, -200 and -300) of the 747 aircraft. The 747 utilized three Carousel systems operating in concert for reliability purposes. The Carousel system and derivatives thereof were subsequently adopted for use in many other commercial and military aircraft. The USAF C-141 was the first military aircraft to utilize the Carousel in a dual system configuration, followed by the C-5A which utilized the triple INS configuration, similar to the 747. The KC-135 fleet was fitted with a dual Carousel system that was aided by a Doppler radar. ARINC Characteristic 704 defines the INS used in commercial air transport. Inertial navigation systems in detail 190px IRBM S3. INSs contain Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) which have angular and linear accelerometers (for changes in position); some IMUs include a gyroscopic element (for maintaining an absolute angular reference). Angular accelerometers measure how the vehicle is rotating in space. Generally, there is at least one sensor for each of the three axes: pitch (nose up and down), yaw (nose left and right) and roll (clockwise or counter-clockwise from the cockpit). Linear accelerometers measure non- gravitational accelerationsEshbach's Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals By Ovid W. Eshbach, Byron pg 9 of the vehicle. Since it can move in three axes (up & down, left & right, forward & back), there is a linear accelerometer for each axis. A computer continually calculates the vehicle's current position. First, for each of the six degrees of freedom (x,y,z and θx, θy and θz), it integrates over time the sensed acceleration, together with an estimate of gravity, to calculate the current velocity. Then it integrates the velocity to calculate the current position. Inertial guidance is difficult without computers. The desire to use inertial guidance in the Minuteman missile and Project Apollo drove early attempts to miniaturize computers. Inertial guidance systems are now usually combined with satellite navigation systems through a digital filtering system. The inertial system provides short term data, while the satellite system corrects accumulated errors of the inertial system. An inertial guidance system that will operate near the surface of the earth must incorporate Schuler tuning so that its platform will continue pointing towards the center of the earth as a vehicle moves from place to place. Basic schemes Gimballed gyrostabilized platforms Some systems place the linear accelerometers on a gimballed gyrostabilized platform. The gimbals are a set of three rings, each with a pair of bearings initially at right angles. They let the platform twist about any rotational axis (or, rather, they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it). There are two gyroscopes (usually) on the platform. Two gyroscopes are used to cancel gyroscopic precession, the tendency of a gyroscope to twist at right angles to an input torque. By mounting a pair of gyroscopes (of the same rotational inertia and spinning at the same speed in opposite directions) at right angles the precessions are cancelled and the platform will resist twisting. This system allows a vehicle's roll, pitch and yaw angles to be measured directly at the bearings of the gimbals. Relatively simple electronic circuits can be used to add up the linear accelerations, because the directions of the linear accelerometers do not change. The big disadvantage of this scheme is that it uses many expensive precision mechanical parts. It also has moving parts that can wear out or jam and is vulnerable to gimbal lock. The primary guidance system of the Apollo spacecraft used a three-axis gyrostabilized platform, feeding data to the Apollo Guidance Computer. Maneuvers had to be carefully planned to avoid gimbal lock. Fluid-suspended gyrostabilized platforms Gimbal lock constrains maneuvering and it would be beneficial to eliminate the slip rings and bearings of the gimbals. Therefore, some systems use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber to mount a gyrostabilized platform. These systems can have very high precisions (e.g., Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere). Like all gyrostabilized platforms, this system runs well with relatively slow, low- power computers. The fluid bearings are pads with holes through which pressurized inert gas (such as helium) or oil presses against the spherical shell of the platform. The fluid bearings are very slippery and the spherical platform can turn freely. There are usually four bearing pads, mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform. In premium systems, the angular sensors are usually specialized transformer coils made in a strip on a flexible printed circuit board. Several coil strips are mounted on great circles around the spherical shell of the gyrostabilized platform. Electronics outside the platform uses similar strip-shaped transformers to read the varying magnetic fields produced by the transformers wrapped around the spherical platform. Whenever a magnetic field changes shape, or moves, it will cut the wires of the coils on the external transformer strips. The cutting generates an electric current in the external strip-shaped coils and electronics can measure that current to derive angles. Cheap systems sometimes use bar codes to sense orientations and use solar cells or a single transformer to power the platform. Some small missiles have powered the platform with light from a window or optic fibers to the motor. A research topic is to suspend the platform with pressure from exhaust gases. Data is returned to the outside world via the transformers, or sometimes LEDs communicating with external photodiodes. Strapdown systems Lightweight digital computers permit the system to eliminate the gimbals, creating strapdown systems, so called because their sensors are simply strapped to the vehicle. This reduces the cost, eliminates gimbal lock, removes the need for some calibrations and increases the reliability by eliminating some of the moving parts. Angular rate sensors called rate gyros measure the angular velocity of the vehicle. A strapdown system needs a dynamic measurement range several hundred times that required by a gimballed system. That is, it must integrate the vehicle's attitude changes in pitch, roll and yaw, as well as gross movements. Gimballed systems could usually do well with update rates of 50–60 Hz. However, strapdown systems normally update about 2000 Hz. The higher rate is needed to let the navigation system integrate the angular rate into an attitude accurately. The data updating algorithms (direction cosines or quaternions) involved are too complex to be accurately performed except by digital electronics. However, digital computers are now so inexpensive and fast that rate gyro systems can now be practically used and mass-produced. The Apollo lunar module used a strapdown system in its backup Abort Guidance System (AGS). Strapdown systems are nowadays commonly used in commercial and military applications (aircraft, ships, ROVs, missiles, etc.). State-of-the- art strapdown systems are based upon Ring Laser Gyroscopes, Fibre Optic Gyrocopes or Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscopes. They are using digital electronics and advanced digital filtering techniques such as Kalman filter. Motion-based alignment The orientation of a gyroscope system can sometimes also be inferred simply from its position history (e.g., GPS). This is, in particular, the case with planes and cars, where the velocity vector usually implies the orientation of the vehicle body. For example, Honeywell's Align in Motion is an initialization process where the initialization occurs while the aircraft is moving, in the air or on the ground. This is accomplished using GPS and an inertial reasonableness test, thereby allowing commercial data integrity requirements to be met. This process has been FAA certified to recover pure INS performance equivalent to stationary align procedures for civilian flight times up to 18 hours. It avoids the need for gyroscope batteries on aircraft. Vibrating gyros Less-expensive navigation systems, intended for use in automobiles, may use a vibrating structure gyroscope to detect changes in heading and the odometer pickup to measure distance covered along the vehicle's track. This type of system is much less accurate than a higher-end INS, but it is adequate for the typical automobile application where GPS is the primary navigation system and dead reckoning is only needed to fill gaps in GPS coverage when buildings or terrain block the satellite signals. Hemispherical resonator gyros (wine glass or mushroom gyros) If a standing wave is induced in a hemispheric resonant structure and then the resonant structure is rotated, the spherical harmonic standing wave rotates through an angle different from the quartz resonator structure due to the Coriolis force. The movement of the outer case with respect to the standing wave pattern is proportional to the total rotation angle and can be sensed by appropriate electronics. The system resonators are machined from fused quartz due to its excellent mechanical properties. The electrodes that drive and sense the standing waves are deposited directly onto separate quartz structures that surround the resonator. These gyros can operate in either a whole angle mode (which gives them nearly unlimited rate capability) or a force rebalance mode that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro housing (which gives them much better accuracy). This system has almost no moving parts and is very accurate. However it is still relatively expensive due to the cost of the precision ground and polished hollow quartz hemispheres. Northrop Grumman currently manufactures IMUs (inertial measurement units) for spacecraft that use HRGs. These IMUs have demonstrated extremely high reliability since their initial use in 1996. Safran manufactures large numbers of HRG based inertial systems dedicated to a wide range of applications. Quartz rate sensors The quartz rate sensor inside an E-Sky model helicopter These products include 'tuning fork gyros'. Here, the gyro is designed as an electronically driven tuning fork, often fabricated out of a single piece of quartz or silicon. Such gyros operate in accordance with the dynamic theory that when an angle rate is applied to a translating body, a Coriolis force is generated. This system is usually integrated on a silicon chip. It has two mass-balanced quartz tuning forks, arranged \\"handle-to- handle\\" so forces cancel. Aluminum electrodes evaporated onto the forks and the underlying chip both drive and sense the motion. The system is both manufacturable and inexpensive. Since quartz is dimensionally stable, the system can be accurate. As the forks are twisted about the axis of the handle, the vibration of the tines tends to continue in the same plane of motion. This motion has to be resisted by electrostatic forces from the electrodes under the tines. By measuring the difference in capacitance between the two tines of a fork, the system can determine the rate of angular motion. Current state-of- the-art non-military technology () can build small solid-state sensors that can measure human body movements. These devices have no moving parts and weigh about . Solid-state devices using the same physical principles are used for image stabilization in small cameras or camcorders. These can be extremely small, around and are built with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies. MHD sensor Sensors based on magnetohydrodynamic principles can be used to measure angular velocities. MEMS gyroscope MEMS gyroscopes typically rely on the Coriolis effect to measure angular velocity. It consists of a resonating proof mass mounted in silicon. The gyroscope is, unlike an accelerometer, an active sensor. The proof mass is pushed back and forth by driving combs. A rotation of the gyroscope generates a Coriolis force that is acting on the mass which results in a motion in a different direction. The motion in this direction is measured by electrodes and represents the rate of turn. Ring Laser Gyros (RLG) A ring laser gyro splits a beam of laser light into two beams in opposite directions through narrow tunnels in a closed circular optical path around the perimeter of a triangular block of temperature-stable Cervit glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner. When the gyro is rotating at some angular rate, the distance traveled by each beam becomes different—the shorter path being opposite to the rotation. The phase shift between the two beams can be measured by an interferometer and is proportional to the rate of rotation (Sagnac effect). In practice, at low rotation rates the output frequency can drop to zero as the result of backscattering causing the beams to synchronise and lock together. This is known as a lock-in, or laser-lock. The result is that there is no change in the interference pattern and therefore no measurement change. To unlock the counter-rotating light beams, laser gyros either have independent light paths for the two directions (usually in fiber optic gyros), or the laser gyro is mounted on a piezo-electric dither motor that rapidly vibrates the laser ring back and forth about its input axis through the lock-in region to decouple the light waves. The shaker is the most accurate, because both light beams use exactly the same path. Thus laser gyros retain moving parts, but they do not move as far. Fiber optic gyros (FOG) A more recent variation on the optical gyroscope, the fiber optic gyroscope, uses an external laser and two beams going opposite directions (counter-propagating) in long spools (several kilometers) of fiber optic filament, with the phase difference of the two beams compared after their travel through the spools of fiber. The basic mechanism, monochromatic laser light travelling in opposite paths and the Sagnac effect, is the same in a FOG and a RLG, but the engineering details are substantially different in the FOG compared to earlier laser gyros. Precise winding of the fiber-optic coil is required to ensure the paths taken by the light in opposite directions are as similar as possible. The FOG requires more complex calibrations than a laser ring gyro making the development and manufacture of FOG's more technically challenging that for a RLG. However FOG's do not suffer from laser lock at low speeds and do not need to contain any moving parts, increasing the maximum potential accuracy and lifespan of a FOG over an equivalent RLG. Pendular accelerometers Principle of open loop accelerometer. Acceleration in the upward direction causes the mass to deflect downward. The basic, open-loop accelerometer consists of a mass attached to a spring. The mass is constrained to move only in line with the spring. Acceleration causes deflection of the mass and the offset distance is measured. The acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance, mass and the spring constant. The system must also be damped to avoid oscillation. A closed-loop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection, thus keeping the mass nearly stationary. Whenever the mass deflects, the feedback loop causes an electric coil to apply an equally negative force on the mass, canceling the motion. Acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied. Because the mass barely moves, the effects of non-linearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced. In addition, this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth beyond the natural frequency of the sensing element. Both types of accelerometers have been manufactured as integrated micro-machinery on silicon chips. TIMU (Timing & Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) department is working on a Micro- PNT (Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation and Timing) program to design Timing & Inertial Measurement Unit (TIMU) chips that do absolute position tracking on a single chip without GPS-aided navigation.Extreme Miniaturization: Seven Devices, One Chip to Navigate without GPS Micro-PNT adds a highly accurate master timing clock integrated into an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) chip, making it a Timing & Inertial Measurement Unit chip. A TIMU chip integrates 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer together with a highly accurate master timing clock, so that it can simultaneously measure the motion tracked and combine that with timing from the synchronized clock.

It is an understorey species of subtropical and tropical rainforest on fertile soils. The natural range of distribution is from Forster, New South Wales (32° S) to central Queensland. This plant features beautifully scented flowers.  Description  It grows as a woody shrub or small tree and reaches 8 m (25 ft) tall. The trunk does not form buttresses but may be crooked, and is covered by smooth grey bark with horizontal markings and long lenticels. The new growth is hairy in plants found north of Coffs Harbour (30° S) . The large glossy dark green leaves are obovate to lanceolate and range from 8–20 cm (3–8 in) long by 2–4 cm wide, and arranged in whorls of 3-4 on the branches. The veins and midrib are prominent on the leaf. The small white fragrant flowers appear from June to November, occur in clusters of two or three and have five lanceolate petals around a tube. The orange oval-shaped fruit ripens in May to September, and bears 14-18 seeds in a pulp. The fragrance of the flowers has been likened to that of the common gardenia. Distribution and habitat The range is from Forster (32° S) on the New South Wales mid-north coast north through to Nambour (26° S) in Queensland. It is found in warm temperate to subtropical rainforests in areas of wetter climate.  Uses  Its bushy lush foliage, fragrant flowers and colourful fruit give it horticultural potential in gardens in warm temperate and subtropical climates. It is suited to a shady position in gardens, or moderately to brightly lit indoor spaces.

Its members are commonly known as native gardenias in Australia. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms atractos \\"spindle\\", and karpos \\"fruit\\", from the spindle-shaped fruit of the type species. Taxonomy Defined by botanists Rudolf Schlechter and Kurt Krause in 1908, the type species is Atractocarpus bracteatus, which is found only on New Caledonia.Schlechter, Friedrich Richard Rudolf & Krause, Kurt. 1908. Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie 40 Beibl. 92: 43. Subsequently, several other species were described from New Caledonia. Meanwhile, the genera Randia and Gardenia had been used as wastebasket taxa, where many species that had been difficult to place had been placed by default. Several Australian species of the genus Randia were found to be not closely related to Neotropical species and were transferred in a review of the genera by Australian botanist Christopher Puttock in 1999; these include several garden plant species such as A. benthamianus, A. chartaceus, and A. fitzalanii. Puttock also proposed that the genera Sukunia, Trukia, Neofranciella, and Sulitia (the last two consisting of once species each) be sunk into Atractocarpus. The resulting genus now contains around forty species, with seven found in Australia, and others in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, and east to Tahiti.

He has directed two feature films, Loanshark (1999) and Hell to Pay (2014), as well as, an assortment of short films and documentaries. Jennings uses handheld cameras and cinéma vérité techniques, shooting his films among old Hollywood buildings and streets.  Early life  Jennings was born in Hollywood, California. He grew up making Super-8 movies and screening them for friends and family. He graduated from Beverly Hills High School and then attended film courses at Columbia College Hollywood (CCH), UCLA, and the American Film Institute.  Career  Jennings writes, directs, produces, and composes the music for his films. He uses digital movie cameras and adds a grainy film look during the editing process. He shoots low- budget films, mostly without permits in a style called guerrilla filmmaking. Film columnist David Del Valle referred to Jennings as a \\"maverick filmmaker.\\" In 1999, Jennings directed his first feature Loanshark, a drama which the Los Angeles Times considered the \\"Best Bet\\" for film when it premiered at the Vogue Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Loanshark also screened at several film festivals in 2000, including Silver Lake, South by Southwest, Santa Monica, and Melbourne Underground. The film depicts the stressful life of a ruthless loan shark who drives around the streets of Hollywood looking for people who owe him money. In 2005, Jennings directed The Weird Museum, a documentary about a circus-like freak show which was located in Hollywood for many years. The documentary was shot just weeks before the museum closed in 1995 and is believed to be the only existing footage of the exhibits. The film screened at the TromaDance Film Festival. Jennings wrote and directed The Drowning in 2013, an ambitious and fascinating short film about a father who loses his son in a swimming pool drowning after receiving a bizarre warning from a street preacher. The film is constructed with a design that feels almost otherworldly. In 2014, Jennings directed his second feature Hell to Pay which was a loose remake of Loanshark. The film tells the story of a debt collector with a penchant for violence who dares to cross his boss. Author Jennings is also an amusement park historian. In August 2009, his first book, Knott's Berry Farm: The Early Years, was published by Arcadia Publishing and features over 200 rare photographs that haven't been widely circulated. The book goes into great detail in describing the history of Knott's Berry Farm and its founder, Walter Knott, including chapters about the park's Ghost Town, its attractions, street performers, and shops. As of 2006, Jennings has been curator of The Knott's Berry Farm Museum, home to the largest collection of vintage Knott's memorabilia in the world. A copy of his book is housed in the Library of Congress. In August 2012, Jennings' second book, Beverly Park: L.A.'s Kiddieland, 1943-74, was published by Retro Image Publishing and features 175 never-before-published photographs. The book tells the story of Beverly Park (also known as kiddieland) and its owner Dave Bradley, who was a ride inventor and pioneer in the amusement park industry. There are also chapters dedicated to all the kiddie rides, attractions, grounds, and party areas that made the park so popular for over 30 years. Beverly Ponyland, a place where children rode ponies around a track for 34 years and was located down the street from Beverly Park, is also covered in the book. In November 2018, a second printing of the book was published with the updated title, Beverly Park: The Kiddieland that Inspired Walt Disney, which included a new, detailed chapter on the park's influence on Walt Disney.

The terms introversion and extraversion were popularized by Carl Jung,Jung, C. G. (1921) Psychologische Typen, Rascher Verlag, Zurich – translation H.G. Baynes, 1923. although both the popular understanding and psychological usage differ from his original intent. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reserved and solitary behavior. Rather than focusing on interpersonal behavior, however, Jung defined introversion as an \\"attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents\\", and extraversion as \\"an attitude-type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object\\". Extraversion and introversion are typically viewed as a single continuum, so to be high in one necessitates being low in the other. Jung provides a different perspective and suggests that everyone has both an extraverted side and an introverted side, with one being more dominant than the other. Virtually all comprehensive models of personality include these concepts in various forms. Examples include the Big Five model, Jung's analytical psychology, Hans Eysenck's three-factor model, Raymond Cattell's 16 personality factors, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator. Varieties William McDougall discussed Jung's conception, and reached this conclusion: \\"the introverts are those in whom reflective thought inhibits and postpones action and expression: the extroverts are those in whom the energies liberated upon the stirring of any propensity flow out freely in outward action and expression.\\"McDougall, W. (1923/1932). The Energies of Men: a Study of the Fundamentals of Dynamic Psychology, Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. 184. Extraversion Extraversion (also spelled as extroversion Retrieved 2018-02-21.) is the state of primarily obtaining gratification from outside oneself.Merriam Webster Dictionary. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves. Introversion Introversion is the state of being predominantly interested in one's own mental self. Introverts are typically perceived as more reserved or reflective. Some popular psychologists have characterized introverts as people whose energy tends to expand through reflection and dwindle during interaction.Helgoe, Laurie (2008). \\"Introvert Power: Why Your Inner Life is Your Hidden Strength\\". Naperville, Illinois: Sourcebooks, Inc. This is similar to Jung's view, although he focused on mental energy rather than physical energy. Few modern conceptions make this distinction. Introverts often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading, writing, or meditating. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.Cain, Susan, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Crown Publishing 2012: quoted by Szalavitz, Maia, \\"'Mind Reading': Q&A; with Susan Cain on the Power of Introverts\\" (WebCite archive), Time Healthland, January 27, 2012; and Cook, Gareth, \\"The Power of Introverts: A Manifesto for Quiet Brilliance\\" (WebCite archive), Scientific American, January 24, 2012. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity at a time and like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents.Introversion Gale Encyclopedia of Childhood & Adolescence. Gale Research, 1998. They are more analytical before speaking.Laney, Marti Olsen (2002), The Introvert Advantage: How to Thrive in an Extrovert World, Workman Publishing. . Quiet: The Power of Introverts... author Susan Cain defines introversion and extraversion in terms of preferences for different levels of stimulation—distinguishing it from shyness (fear of social judgment and humiliation).Szalavitz, Maia, \\"‘Mind Reading’: Q&A; with Susan Cain on the Power of Introverts\\" () Time Healthland, January 27, 2012. Mistaking introversion for shyness is a common error. Introversion is a preference, while shyness stems from distress. Introverts prefer solitary to social activities, but do not necessarily fear social encounters like shy people do.All About Shyness Meredith Whitten, Psych Central, August 21, 2001; Accessed 2007-08-02 Susan Cain, author of the book Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, argues that modern Western culture misjudges the capabilities of introverted people, leading to a waste of talent, energy, and happiness. Cain describes how society is biased against introverts, and that, with people being taught from childhood that to be sociable is to be happy, introversion is now considered \\"somewhere between a disappointment and pathology\\". In contrast, Cain says that introversion is not a \\"second-class\\" trait but that both introverts and extraverts enrich society, with examples including the introverts J. K. Rowling, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Seuss, W. B. Yeats, Steven Spielberg, and Larry Page. Ambiversion Although many people view being introverted or extraverted as mutually exclusive, most contemporary trait theories measure levels of extraversion-introversion as part of a single, continuous dimension of personality, with some scores near one end, and others near the halfway mark.The OCEAN of Personality Personality Synopsis, Chapter 4: Trait Theory. AllPsych Online. Last updated March 23, 2004 Ambiversion is falling more or less directly in the middle. An ambivert is moderately comfortable with groups and social interaction, but also relishes time alone, away from a crowd. In simpler words, an ambivert is a person whose behaviour changes according to the situation they are in. In the face of authority or in the presence of strangers, the person may be introverted. However, in the presence of family or close friends, the person may be highly energetic or extraverted. Relative prevalence Cain further reports that studies indicate that 33 to 50% of the American population are introverts.Cain, Susan (2012), Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking at page 3 (Introduction) and page 280 (note 11). • Goudreau, Jenna, \\"The Secret Power Of Introverts\\" (WebCite archive), Forbes, January 26, 2012. Particular subpopulations have higher prevalence, with a 6,000-subject MBTI-based survey indicating that 60% of attorneys, and 90% of intellectual property attorneys, are introverts. Measurement The extent of extraversion and introversion is most commonly assessed through self-report measures, although peer-reports and third-party observation can also be used. Self-report measures are either lexical or based on statements. The type of measure is determined by an assessment of psychometric properties, and the time and space constraints of the research being undertaken.  Lexical self-reporting  Lexical measures use individual adjectives that reflect extravert and introvert traits, such as outgoing, talkative, reserved and quiet. Words representing introversion are reverse-coded to create composite measures of extraversion-introversion running on a continuum. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure as part of his 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. However, the psychometric properties of Saucier's original mini-markers have been found to be suboptimal with samples outside of North America. As a result, a systematically revised measure was developed to have better psychometric properties, the International English Mini-Markers. The International English Mini-Markers has good internal consistency reliabilities, and other validity, for assessing extraversion-introversion and other five-factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. Internal consistency reliability of the extraversion measure for native English-speakers is reported as a Cronbach's alpha (α) of 0.92, that for non-native English- speakers is α of 0.85.  Statement self-reporting  Statement measures tend to contain more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked the extent to which they, for example, \\"Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others\\". While some statement-based measures of extraversion-introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited for use outside America. For instance, statements like \\"Keep in the background\\" and \\"Know how to captivate people\\" are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, except in a literal sense. Eysenck's theory Hans Eysenck described extraversion-introversion as the degree to which a person is outgoing and interactive with other people. These behavioral differences are presumed to be the result of underlying differences in brain physiology. Eysenck associated cortical inhibition and excitation with the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), a pathway located in the brainstem. Extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to raise their naturally low arousal level, whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to avoid raising their naturally high arousal level too far. Eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his P-E-N model of personality, which also includes psychoticism and neuroticism. Eysenck originally suggested that extraversion was a combination of two major tendencies, impulsiveness and sociability. He later added several other more specific traits, namely liveliness, activity level, and excitability. These traits are further linked in his personality hierarchy to even more specific habitual responses, such as partying on the weekend. Eysenck compared this trait to the four temperaments of ancient medicine, with choleric and sanguine temperaments equating to extraversion, and melancholic and phlegmatic temperaments equating to introversion. Twin studies indicate that extraversion-introversion has a genetic component Biological factors The relative importance of nature versus environment in determining the level of extraversion is controversial and the focus of many studies. Twin studies have found a genetic component of 39% to 58%. In terms of the environmental component, the shared family environment appears to be far less important than individual environmental factors that are not shared between siblings. Eysenck proposed that extraversion was caused by variability in cortical arousal. He hypothesized that introverts are characterized by higher levels of activity than extraverts and so are chronically more cortically aroused than extraverts. That extraverts require more external stimulation than introverts has been interpreted as evidence for this hypothesis. Other evidence of the \\"stimulation\\" hypothesis is that introverts salivate more than extraverts in response to a drop of lemon juice. This is due to increased activity in their ARAS, which responds to stimuli like food or social contact. Extraversion has been linked to higher sensitivity of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel the excitement of a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater. One study found that introverts have more blood flow in the frontal lobes of their brain and the anterior or frontal thalamus, which are areas dealing with internal processing, such as planning and problem solving. Extraverts have more blood flow in the anterior cingulate gyrus, temporal lobes, and posterior thalamus, which are involved in sensory and emotional experience. This study and other research indicate that introversion-extraversion is related to individual differences in brain function. A study on regional brain volume found a positive correlation between introversion and grey matter volume in the right prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, as well as a positive correlation between introversion and total white matter volume.Forsman, L. J., de Manzano, Ö., Karabanov, A., Madison, G., & Ullén, F. (2012). Differences in regional brain volume related to the extraversion–introversion dimension—a voxel based morphometry study. Neuroscience research, 72(1), 59–67. Task- related functional neuroimaging has shown that extraversion is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, prefrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and the amygdala. Extraversion has also been linked to physiological factors such as respiration, through its association with surgency. Behaviour Various differences in behavioural characteristics are attributed to extraverts and introverts. According to one study, extraverts tend to wear more decorative clothing, whereas introverts prefer practical, comfortable clothes. Extraverts are more likely to prefer more upbeat, conventional, and energetic music than introverts. Personality also influences how people arrange their work areas. In general, extraverts decorate their offices more, keep their doors open, keep extra chairs nearby, and are more likely to put dishes of candy on their desks. These are attempts to invite co- workers and encourage interaction. Introverts, in contrast, decorate less and tend to arrange their workspace to discourage social interaction.Gosling, S. (2008). Snoop. New York: Basic Books. Despite these differences, a meta- analysis of 15 experience sampling studies has suggested that there is a great deal of overlap in the way that extraverts and introverts behave. In these studies, participants used mobile devices to report how extraverted (e.g., bold, talkative, assertive, outgoing) they were acting at multiple times during their daily lives. Fleeson and Gallagher (2009) found that extraverts regularly behave in an introverted way, and introverts regularly behave in an extraverted way. Indeed, there was more within-person variability than between-person variability in extraverted behaviours. The key feature that distinguishes extraverts and introverts was that extraverts tend to act moderately extraverted about 5–10% more often than introverts. From this perspective, extraverts and introverts are not \\"fundamentally different\\". Rather, an \\"extravert\\" is just someone who acts more extraverted more often, suggesting that extraversion is more about what one \\"does\\" than what one \\"has\\". Additionally, a study by Lippa (1978) found evidence for the extent to which individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their self- monitoring. This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations. Humans are complex and unique, and because introversion-extraversion varies along a continuum, individuals may have a mixture of both orientations. A person who acts introverted in one situation may act extraverted in another, and people can learn to act in \\"counter dispositional\\" ways in certain situations. For example, Brian Little's free trait theory suggests that people can take on \\"free traits\\", behaving in ways that may not be their \\"first nature\\", but can strategically advance projects that are important to them. Together, this presents an optimistic view of what extraversion is. Rather than being fixed and stable, individuals vary in their extraverted behaviours across different moments, and can choose to act extraverted to advance important personal projects or even increase their happiness, as mentioned above. Implications Acknowledging that introversion and extraversion are normal variants of behavior can help in self-acceptance and understanding of others. For example, an extravert can accept their introverted partner's need for solitude, while an introvert can acknowledge their extraverted partner's need for social interaction. Researchers have found a correlation between extraversion and self-reported happiness. That is, more extraverted people tend to report higher levels of happiness than introverts.Myers, David G (1992). The Secrets of Happiness Psychology Today. Other research has shown that being instructed to act in an extraverted manner leads to increases in positive affect, even for people who are trait-level introverts. This does not mean that introverts are unhappy. Extraverts simply report experiencing more positive emotions, whereas introverts tend to be closer to neutral. This may be because extraversion is socially preferable in contemporary Western culture and thus introversion feels less desirable. In addition to the research on happiness, other studies have found that extraverts tend to report higher levels of self-esteem than introverts. Others suggest that such results reflect socio-cultural bias in the survey itself. Dr. David Meyers has claimed that happiness is a matter of possessing three traits: self-esteem, optimism, and extraversion. Meyers bases his conclusions on studies that report extraverts to be happier; these findings have been questioned in light of the fact that the \\"happiness\\" prompts given to the studies' subjects, such as \\"I like to be with others\\" and \\"I'm fun to be with,\\" only measure happiness among extraverts. Also, according to Carl Jung, introverts acknowledge more readily their psychological needs and problems, whereas extraverts tend to be oblivious to them because they focus more on the outer world. Although extraversion is perceived as socially desirable in Western culture, it is not always an advantage. For example, extraverted youths are more likely to engage in antisocial or delinquent behavior. In line with this, certain evidence suggest that the trait of extraversion may also be related to that of psychopathy. Conversely, while introversion is perceived as less socially desirable, it is strongly associated with positive traits such as intelligence and \\"giftedness.\\" For many years, researchers have found that introverts tend to be more successful in academic environments, which extraverts may find boring. Research shows that behavioral immune system, the psychological processes that infer infection risk from perceptual cues and respond to these perceptual cues through the activation of aversive emotions, may influence gregariousness. Although extraversion is associated with many positive outcomes like higher levels of happiness, those extraverted people are also more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, such as airborne infections, as they tend to have more contact with people. When individuals are more vulnerable to infection, the cost of being social will be relatively greater. Therefore, people tend to be less extraversive when they feel vulnerable and vice versa. Although neither introversion nor extraversion is pathological, psychotherapists can take temperament into account when treating clients. Clients may respond better to different types of treatment depending on where they fall on the introversion-extraversion spectrum. Teachers can also consider temperament when dealing with their pupils, for example acknowledging that introverted children need more encouragement to speak in class while extraverted children may grow restless during long periods of quiet study. Regional variation Some claim that Americans live in an \\"extraverted society\\" that rewards extravert behavior and rejects introversion. This is because the U.S. is a culture of external personality, whereas in some other cultures people are valued for their \\"inner selves and their moral rectitude\\". Other cultures, such as those in Japan, China and regions where Orthodox Christianity, Buddhism, Sufism etc. prevail, prize introversion. These cultural differences predict individuals' happiness in that people who score higher in extraversion are happier, on average, in particularly extraverted cultures and vice versa. Researchers have found that people who live on islands tend to be less extraverted (more introverted) than those living on the mainland, and that people whose ancestors had inhabited the island for twenty generations tend to be less extraverted than more recent arrivals. Furthermore, people who emigrate from islands to the mainland tend to be more extraverted than people that stay on islands, and those that immigrate to islands. In the United States, researchers have found that people living in the midwestern states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois score higher than the U.S. average on extraversion. Utah and the southeastern states of Florida and Georgia also score high on this personality trait. The most introverted states in the U.S. are Maryland, New Hampshire, Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Vermont. People who live in the northwestern states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming are also relatively introverted. Relation to happiness As earlier stated, extraverts are often found to have higher levels of positive affect than introverts. However, this relationship has only been found between extraversion and activated forms of positive affect. There is no relationship between extraversion and deactivated (calm) forms of positive affect such as contentment or serenity, although one study found a negative relationship between extraversion and deactivated positive affect (i.e. a positive relationship between introversion and calm positive affect). Moreover, the relationship between extraversion and activated positive affect is only significant for agentic extraversion, i.e. there is no significant relationship between affiliative extraversion and activated positive affect, especially when controlling for neuroticism. An influential review article concluded that personality, specifically extraversion and emotional stability, was the best predictor of subjective well-being. As examples, Argyle and Lu (1990) found that the trait of extraversion, as measured by Extraversion Scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), was positively and significantly correlated with positive affect, as measured by the Oxford Happiness Inventory. Using the same positive affect and extraversion scales, Hills and Argyle (2001) found that positive affect was again significantly correlated with extraversion. Also, the study by Emmons and Diener (1986) showed that extraversion correlates positively and significantly with positive affect but not with negative affect. Similar results were found in a large longitudinal study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992), which assessed 14,407 participants from 100 areas of continental United States. Using the abbreviated General Well-Being Schedule, which tapped positive and negative affects, and Costa and McCrae's (1986). short version of the NEO's Extraversion scale, the authors reported that extraverts experienced greater well-being at two points in time, during which data were collected: first between 1971 and 1975, and later between 1981 and 1984. However, the latter study did not control for neuroticism, an important covariate when investigating relationships between extraversion and positive affect or wellbeing.Vittersø, J., & Nilsen, F. (2002). The conceptual and relational structure of subjective well-being, neuroticism, and extraversion: Once again, neuroticism is the important predictor of happiness. Social Indicators Research, 57(1), 89-118. Studies that controlled for neuroticism have found no significant relationship between extraversion and subjective well-being.Vittersø, J., & Nilsen, F. (2002). The conceptual and relational structure of subjective well-being, neuroticism, and extraversion: Once again, neuroticism is the important predictor of happiness. Social Indicators Research, 57(1), 89-118. Larsen and Ketelaar (1991) showed that extraverts respond more to positive affect than to negative affect, since they exhibit more positive-affect reactivity to the positive-affect induction, yet they do not react more negatively to the negative-affect induction. Instrumental view The instrumental view proposes that personality traits give rise to conditions and actions, which have affective consequences, and thus generate individual differences in emotionality. Personality trait as a cause of higher sociability According to the instrumental view, one explanation for greater subjective well-being among extraverts could be that extraversion helps in the creation of life circumstances, which promote high levels of positive affect. Specifically, the personality trait of extraversion is seen as a facilitator of more social interactions, since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal. Social activity hypothesis According to the social activity hypothesis, more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent, and higher levels, of positive affect. Therefore, it is believed that since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts, they also possess higher levels of positive affect brought on by social interactions. Specifically, the results of Furnham and Brewin's study (1990) suggest that extraverts enjoy and participate more in social activities than introverts, and as a result extraverts report a higher level of happiness. Also, in the study of Argyle and Lu (1990) extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities, and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as party games, jokes, or going to the cinema. Similar results were reported by Diener, Larsen, and Emmons (1984) who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts, especially when engaging in recreational activities. However, a variety of findings contradict the claims of the social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than introverts even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment. Similarly, a study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992) showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to introverts (38%), they were happier than introverts regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than introverts, but in general extraverts and introverts do not differ in the quantity of their socialization. Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008), who found that extraverts and introverts both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and introverts participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be explained by the fact that extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, whereas introverts, when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships. Social attention theory Yet another explanation of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion is a tendency to behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others and he or she gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity. Temperamental view Temperamental view is based on the notion that there is a direct link between people's personality traits and their sensitivity to positive and negative affects. Affective reactivity model The affective reactivity model states that the strength of a person's reactions to affect-relevant events are caused by people's differences in affect. This model is based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory by Jeffrey Alan Gray, which states that people with stronger behavioral activation system (BAS) are high in reward responsiveness and are predisposed to the personality trait of extraversion, while people with a stronger behavioral inhibition system (BIS) are lower in reward responsiveness and are more predisposed to personality trait of neuroticism and introversion. Therefore, extraverts are seen as having a temperamental predisposition to positive affect since positive mood induction has a greater effect on them than on introverts, thus extraverts are more prone to react to pleasant effects. For example, Gable, Reis, and Elliot (2000). found in two consecutive studies that people with more sensitive BIS reported higher levels of average negative affect, while people with more sensitive BAS reported higher levels of positive affect. Also, Zelenski and Larsen (1999) found that people with more sensitive BAS reported more positive emotions during the positive mood induction, while people with more sensitive BIS reported more negative emotions during the negative mood induction. Social reactivity theory The social reactivity theory alleges that all humans, whether they like it or not, are required to participate in social situations. Since extraverts prefer engaging in social interactions more than introverts, they also derive more positive affect from such situations than introverts do. The support for this theory comes from work of Brian R. Little, who popularized concept of \\"restorative niches\\". Little claimed that life often requires people to participate in social situations, and since acting social is out of character for introverts, it was shown to harm their well-being. Therefore, one way to preserve introverts' well-being is for them to recharge as often as possible in places where they can return to their true selves—places Little calls \\"restorative niches\\". However, it was also found that extraverts did not respond stronger to social situations than introverts, nor did they report bigger boosts of positive affect during such interactions. Affective regulation Another possible explanation for more happiness among extraverts comes from the fact that extraverts are able to better regulate their affective states. This means that in ambiguous situations (situations where positive and negative moods are introduced and mixed in similar proportions) extraverts show a slower decrease of positive affect, and, as a result, they maintained a more positive affect balance than introverts. Extraverts may also choose activities that facilitate happiness (e.g., recalling pleasant vs. unpleasant memories) more than introverts when anticipating difficult tasks. The set-point model a.k.a. affect-level model According to the set-point model, levels of positive and negative affects are more or less fixed within each individual, hence, after a positive or negative event, people's moods tend to go back to the pre-set level. According to the set-point model, extraverts experience more happiness because their pre-set level of positive affect is set higher than the pre-set point of positive affect in introverts, therefore extraverts require less positive reinforcement in order to feel happy. Pleasure-arousal relation A study by Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and introverts engage in different behaviors when feeling pleasant, which may explain underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by introverts. Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings are more likely to be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for introverts, resulting in introverts exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such a situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When everything is going well for introverts, they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content. Complications to the extraversion-happiness correlation Though extraversion has consistently been shown to have a strong correlation with happiness and well-being, these findings are complicated by the presence of other personality traits that act as strong indicators of happiness. Neuroticism and extraversion In multiple studies, neuroticism has been shown to have an equal, if not larger, impact on happiness and subjective well-being than extraversion. One study classified school children into four categories based on their scores in assessments of extraversion and emotional stability (neuroticism). The results showed no significant difference between the happiness levels of stable introverts and stable extraverts, while unstable extraverts and introverts both demonstrated significantly less happiness than their counterparts. In this study, neuroticism appeared to be the more salient factor for overall well-being. Likewise, in later studies, researchers used assessment scales to test for categories such as self-esteem and life-goal orientation, which they had positively correlated with happiness. Participants' responses to these scales suggested that neuroticism actually had a larger impact than extraversion in measures of well-being. Other Big 5 factors and extraversion Though extraversion and neuroticism seem to have the largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being. For example, one study showed that conscientiousness and agreeableness correlated about 0.20 with subjective well-being. While the effect of these traits was not as strong as extraversion or neuroticism, it is clear that they still have some impact on happiness outcomes. Similarly, interactions between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scales to assess subjective well- being. They found that extraversion only served as a predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism. In addition to the importance of including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor. Other contributing personality factors There is also evidence that other non-trait elements of personality may correlate with happiness. For instance, one study demonstrated that various features of one's goals, such as progress towards important goals or conflicts between them, can affect both emotional and cognitive well-being. Several other researchers have also suggested that, at least in more individualistic cultures, having a coherent sense of one's personality (and acting in a way that conforms to that self-concept) is positively related to well-being. Thus, focusing solely on extraversion—or even extraversion and neuroticism—is likely to provide an incomplete picture of the relationship between happiness and personality. Culture In addition, one's culture may also influence happiness and overall subjective well-being. The overall level of happiness fluctuates from culture to culture, as does preferred expression of happiness. Comparing various international surveys across countries reveals that different nations, and different ethnic groups within nations, exhibit differences in average life satisfaction. For example, one researcher found that between 1958 and 1987, Japanese life satisfaction fluctuated around 6 on a 10-point scale, while Denmark's fluctuated around 8. Comparing ethnic groups within the United States, another study found that European Americans reported being \\"significantly happier\\" with their lives than Asian Americans. Researchers have hypothesized a number of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations. Taken together, these findings suggest that while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.

Background  Yoshihara always loved drifting but saw no real economic opportunity in the sport. Yoshihara instead worked in more stable, long term jobs, taking on jobs at various companies including a car dealership, a telephone company, and a trucking service. However, in 2003, Yoshihara was offered a chance to compete in the 2003 D1 Grand Prix in its inaugural season in the United States, and accepted the offer, although he had never been prior or even competed in a drift competition. Yoshihara entered the D1 driving for Pacific Rim Motorsport in a Nissan Silvia (S13). Having never competed, Yoshihara was a rookie with no competition experience but qualified and finished in the top half out of 32 competitors. Yoshihara then competed in the Drift Showoff in Irwindale, California and took a podium spot to finish 2nd overall. Yoshihara ended his maiden season of 2003 with multiple wins. As a result, he was entered into the 2004 Formula Drift Championship Series the following season. Yoshihara finished in the top 8 at two rounds and placed 2nd at two of the rounds placing him 2nd overall in the championship run. Yoshihara earned the accolade of being the driver with the fastest entry speed every time he raced in the 2004 Formula Drift season. In 2005 and 2006 Yoshihara earned even more success in the Formula Drift series with multiple podium finishes, and in 2007 finished 3rd overall. In 2008, Yoshihara entered with a factory-backed Pontiac GTO for RMR Racing, along with teammate Rhys Millen. Yoshihara ended the 2008 season with a podium finish and placed 2nd overall during the Red Bull Drifting World Championship. Throughout the 2008 season, Yoshihara took podium twice and eventually finished 4th overall in the Formula D series. The 2009 season saw Yoshihara signed to Falken Tire, driving a V8 powered Lexus IS350.Falken Tire Throughout the 2009 season, Yoshihara and his new team experienced developmental problems with the Lexus, eventually crashing and retiring it. Yoshihara finished off the season driving a team built Nissan 240SX. Yoshihara finished in 11th place for overall championship points. In 2010, Yoshihara signed on for another season with Falken, continuing with the 2009 season’s Nissan 240SX, which was now further modified, receiving a motor transplant and major suspension tuning. Yoshiharaended the 2010 drift season in 4th place in overall championship points. Yoshihara continued to drive for Falken for 2011, with the same Nissan 240SX as he did in the 2009 and 2010 seasons; however, with more changes to the car, Yoshihara finished the 2011 season as Formula DRIFT champion and also won the Triple Crown award. Yoshihara drove the Nissan 240SX through 2012 and 2013 where he finished 7th and 11th respectively. For the 2014 Formula Drift season, he switched to a 2014 Subaru BRZ.

Originally begun by Dave Raggett in 1993, development continued at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular at the beginning of the World Wide Web. Arena, which predated Netscape Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, featured a number of innovations used later in commercial products. It was the first browser to support background images, tables, text flow around images, and inline mathematical expressions. The Arena browser served as the W3C's testbed browser from 1994 to 1996 when it was succeeded by the Amaya project. History In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England devoted his spare time to developing Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the browser was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, Raggett demonstrated the browser at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, and other aspects of HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept browser for this work. Using the Arena browser, Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena. Since July 1994 Lie was integrating libwww and CSS and helping Raggett. In October 1995, Yves Lafon joined the team for a year to provide support for HTML form and style sheet development. Arena was originally released for Unix, and although there was talk of a Windows and Macintosh port, neither came to fruition. Despite its time of development, Arena is in certain areas a relatively modern browser; because it functioned as a testbed, it saw the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream, e.g. CSS. Arena implemented many elements of the HTML3 and HTML3.2 specification including math elements that were deprecated in HTML4, HTML tables, and experimental style sheets. W3C pre-Beta The development history and the source code of earlier software builds are not well documented, because the developers didn't want to distribute the source code until they considered the browser to be stable. In version 0.95, support for inline JPEG images was added. In version 0.96, support was added for the FTP, NNTP, and Gopher protocols, as well as experimental support for CSS. In Arena 0.98 Dave Beckett added full PNG support. W3C Beta-1 The W3C published 5 versions of the Arena beta-1 between 27 November 1995 and 8 February 1996 improving 16-bit operating system support and reimplementing CSS (which was still a Working Draft). The W3C and the INRIA, a French national research institution, gave additional funding to develop CSS. To better implement and write CSS, an experimental style sheet for Arena was developed. On 22 May 1996, the W3C announced that Amaya will replace Arena as their new testbed and that the W3C was looking for a new maintainer because the W3C didn't have the resources for two testbeds. W3C Beta-2 How Arena works:https://web.archive.org/web/20070721112850/http://ws.m2m-dc.ne.jp/~shin/Arena- CJK-doc/figure.html or https://web.archive.org/web/20070721112811/http://ws.m2m-dc.ne.jp/~shin/Arena- CJK-doc/ W3C Arena: W3C's: ++ HTTP ++ ++ ++ |Server|--------------->|Buffer|--->|Frame |--->|X11R6 ++ ++ ++ ++  +---+----+ +--------+ +---+----+ +---+------+ libwww  code  HTML  drawing   conv  parser  routine +---+----+ +---+----+ +---+----+ +---+------+ OMRON's:   ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ |Server|----|TmpBuf|--->|Buffer|--->|Frame |--->|X11R6 ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ HTTP Internal CharCode Beta-2 had two builds (beta-2a: 28 February 1996 and beta-2b: 21 March 1996) and introduced a new API for communicating with other applications. Also, the internal component libwww was updated to version 4. OMRON Corporation developed an internationalized version that could display Chinese, Korean and Japanese characters in one page. OMRON's Arena supports both ISO-2022 and Unicode. It is able to guess the charset parameter automatically if charset parameter isn't specified in Content-Type field. W3C Beta-3 Beta-3a released on 14 August 1996 and Beta-3b released on 16 September 1996 introduced support for the Linux operating systems on m68k and DEC Alpha. CSS 1 support was enhanced and the internationalized version was also updated. Between the two beta-3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the Amaya browser. Beta-3 was the last involvement of the W3C in the development of Arena. On 17 February 1997, Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing the browser. Yggdrasil phase The latest Arena 0.3.62-1 build on its start page. On 17 February 1997, the W3C approved Yggdrasil to coordinate future development of Arena. Development was taken over by Yggdrasil, with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X Window System browser licensed under the GNU General Public License. Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997. Development stopped in late 1998, with the final release being on 25 November 1998.Because the official page is no longer online, the older source code and precompiled builds of Yggdrasil's development are no longer available, although Debian's repository archive contains the three newest builds. The W3C did not consider demonstration projects to be high priority, and thus, the Arena browser was entirely shut down in favor of outside Linux-community development. Features Arena supported the following features: * HTML3.0 – the HTML3.2 standard predecessor, which includes \`<math>\`, tables, forms, etc. * CSS1 * style sheet editing. This very experimental style sheet editor was implemented using forms * editing remote HTML pages * MIME (reads your mailcap file and applies the rules) * direct access to WAIS engines (optionally) * HTTP 1.1 proposed by RFC 2068 (formerly called HTTP-NG) * HTML editing with external editor * external client communication (API and HTML \\"mailto:\\" scheme) * PNG, JPEG, GIF (but not animated GIFs) * Bookmarks (since 0.3.18) * full XPM (since 0.3.33) and full XBM (since 0.3.34) * Java applets (since 0.3.39) * HTML Table support * HTML Math equations * Link rendition * FTP, NNTP, Gopher Technical Arena was built using the multi-threaded library of common code called the W3C Reference Library, now called libwww. Originally, the Arena browser was built on top of Xlib as Raggett considered the programming manuals for Motif and other X libraries to be rather daunting. Version numbering Arena has three different systems for the version numbering. The W3C pre-beta phase uses a system of numbers up to 0.99, which indicated that these builds were in alpha-quality and the browser could have new features. The beta phase changed the version numbering to a system consisting of the word \\"Beta-\\" beta followed by a number. After the beta-phase, the final product would have the version 1.0. After Yggdrasil overtook the development, the development status was changed from the W3C beta builds back to alpha, implying that the Arena browser wasn't yet ready for release. The beta-3e version numbering then became 0.3.5 in GNU style Development remained in alpha stage until 0.3.62, and never again advanced to beta. Criticism Although Arena ran well, there were inconsistent reports about the speed of Arena. The biggest problems were that Arena couldn't handle forms, and that the PNG support was broken from version 0.3.07 on. Earlier Arena releases had full alpha-channel support, but only with using Arena's own \\"sandy\\" background pattern. The animated GIFs extension – presented by Netscape in March 1996 – didn't work properly. Other problems included rendering problems with tables, and the lack of integration of so-called extended HTML code, i.e. the \`BG COLOR\`-tag and the \`DIV ALIGN\`-tag. Earlier versions of Arena (until 0.3.26 (01.06.97)) didn't support the email MIME.

It is located at the geographic centre of the Island of Montreal on the western slope of Mount Royal and is part of the borough of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame- de-Grâce. History Historically, the original settlement, the Village of Côte-des-Neiges, was founded in 1862 and annexed by Montreal in two parts in 1908 and 1910. In 1876, land owner and farmer James Swail began residential subdivisions on the eastern side of Decelles Avenue. In 1906, a large housing development was started in the area, called Northmount Heights, built by developer Northmount Land Company. Much of this area has been expropriated by the Université de Montréal. Geographically it was bordered by Decelles Avenue to the north east and the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery to the south east, Westmount to the southwest and situated on the confluence of Côte-des-Neiges Road and Queen Mary Road. It was one of the last areas of the city of Montreal to be developed and urbanized. Up until World War II it remained a village surrounded by working farms to the north and west. A ski hill to the south near present-day Ridgewood Avenue at the foot of the mountain and present day Saint Joseph's Oratory, was once used regularly by the Montreal Ski Club into the 1940s. Demographics Today, the neighbourhood has a large immigrant and student population, and is one of the most densely populated and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods in Canada. With over 100 different ethnic communities, predominantly: Québécois, Filipino, West Indian (Black Canadians), South Asian (Tamils and Bengalis), Jewish, Latin American, Iranian, Chinese, Arab, Vietnamese and most recently Eastern European and African. It is one of the few Montreal neighbourhoods where neither the French nor English language dominate. Both national languages are spoken equally, along with many others by a high number of multilingual speakers.

Warner Bros. contract player Nick Adams joined the cast as Stockdale's fellow military draftee Benjamin B. Whitledge, as did Murray Hamilton as Irving S. Blanchard. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin inspired by the original novel.  Plot  Will Stockdale (Griffith) is a backwoods rube from Georgia, who is drafted into the United States Air Force. Other draftees being transported to basic training include the dim Ben Whitledge (Nick Adams) and obnoxious bully Irving S. Blanchard (Murray Hamilton). The unhappy Whitledge wants to be assigned to the infantry where his six brothers served. At boot camp, Stockdale proceeds to make life miserable for the man in charge, Master Sergeant Orville C. King (Myron McCormick), who likes his barracks to be quiet and calm. In exasperation, the sergeant places Stockdale on full-time latrine duty. Stockdale believes his new position of \\"P.L.O.\\" (Permanent Latrine Orderly) to be a promotion. A company inspection takes a surprising turn when Stockdale's immaculately clean latrine impresses King's company commander. King gets into hot water, however, when Stockdale reveals that the sergeant kept him on permanent bathroom duty while neglecting to have the recruit complete all the required military exams. The company commander orders King to help Stockdale through his training in one week, or else he will be demoted and made \\"P. L. O.\\" himself. Rushing him through testing, King bribes Stockdale by promising to give him his wristwatch if he can pass. Stockdale takes a manual dexterity test from Corporal John C. Brown (Don Knotts), a psychiatric test from Maj. Royal B. Demming (James Millhollin), and an eye exam. Stockdale manages to pass despite driving all of the examiners crazy and gets the wristwatch as a reward. Blanchard convinces King to get Stockdale drunk so that he will fail the next day's inspection. Stockdale, used to strong homemade whiskey, stays sober while King and Blanchard get drunk. They begin a barroom brawl with equally drunk infantrymen, but Stockdale leaves and returns to the base, avoiding the M.P.s. Blanchard is arrested and King is missing when the colonel and captain inspect the latrine and barracks the next day. Stockdale has mechanically rigged all the toilet seats to open simultaneously in a \\"salute\\". A filthy King is found after he sneaks into the latrine and sets off the toilet lids. He is summarily reduced to private rank and sent to gunnery school along with Stockdale and Whitledge. As King goes back to his office dejected, he admits to Stockdale that he has grown to like him. Stockdale gives the watch back to King. At gunnery school, Stockdale is at the bottom of the class and Whitledge is next to the bottom. King graduates as the top man and is assigned to the staff of General Eugene Bush (Howard Smith) at his former rank. On their first flight, Stockdale and Whitledge fly to Denver in an obsolete B-25 bomber. Stockdale's assignment is tail gunner. After putting the plane on autopilot, the pilots fall asleep, and the airplane becomes lost at night over the atomic bomb test site at Yucca Flats, Nevada. The radio operator was left behind at the base, so Stockdale and Whitledge must radio to obtain their position. Military radiomen on the ground, confused by Stockdale's folksy, clownish speech, have the commander of the atomic bomb test rouse General Bush to confirm that Stockdale is not a prankster. Bush reassures Stockdale that he is not a foreign agent, as King tells Bush to remind Stockdale of the watch. Following detonation of an atom bomb, a fire breaks out in the aft of the plane. Stockdale and Whitledge bail out and travel for days to get back to the base. They are declared dead by King, but the officers survive and are to be decorated. During the air medal ceremony, Stockdale and Whitledge reappear, so the Air Force has to cover up the story to avoid an international public humiliation. Stockdale suggests both he and Whitledge be transferred to the infantry. General Bush heartily approves and has King transferred with them.  Cast  * Andy Griffith as Pvt.

The film is also known as Double Crossed Fool (international TV title) and The Last Three. It is a sequel to The Devil with Hitler.  Plot  Germany's Führer Adolf Hitler embarks on a secret journey to the oriental country of Norom to negotiate a treaty with the blood-thirsty High Chief Paj Mub, mostly because Paj Mub insists on meeting Hitler personally instead of making relations through Hitler's emissary, Kapitän von Popoff. Unfortunately, despite Hitler's insistence that they shouldn't be told and Goebbels' efforts to mislead them, his Axis partners Benito Mussolini of Italy and General Suki Yaki of Japan unsolicitedly appear at the submarine dock and invite themselves to the trip. However, at the same time an American supply ship has just been sunk by a German U-boat, although the crew under their skipper, Captain Spense, escape in a lifeboat. They incidentally land on Norom, where they discover the High Chief's camp, and as Seaman Benson does some reconnaissance, he meets Kela, the young female assistant to an alcoholic magician, who tells him that her master was hired by Paj Mub for an exclusive performance in honor of Hitler's upcoming reception. Benson spontaneously hits upon the plan to impersonate the magician and sneaks into the camp, where Kela instructs him in the use of the magician's props. At the same time, Spense and the rest of his men witness Hitler arriving and disembarking at the island (although they do not recognize him from the distance), and decide to investigate. Forewarned by Popoff not to displease the High Chief (lest they would surely not only lose the chance to this contract, but perhaps also their heads), Hitler and his partners meet Paj Mub, who invites them to dinner before he will sign the treaty. However, Benson does his best to ruin the meeting: first, by spiking the served soup with pepper (this results in Hitler and Suki Yaki finding it unpalatable, while Mussolini thinks it bland), then switching the guests' wine with kerosene. Benson as the magician is then brought in and demonstrates the magic trunk illusion, switching Kela for himself. The Paj Mub likes it and insists that one of the three Axis partners go into the box next. Hitler refuses on the grounds that he likes his appearance, and Mussolini begs off due to his girth, so Suki Yaki goes into the trunk. There, he accidentally gets knocked unconscious by Kela, who is trying to fend off an orang-utan who discovered the tunnel under the trunk. Because of this, the ape takes Kela's intended place in the trick, greatly amusing the Paj Mub. He agrees to sign the contract, but as \\"Suki Yaki\\" is supposed to sign before the High Chief, the ape squirts Hitler and Mussolini with ink, prompting Paj Mub to consider signing the treaty the next morning and sticking the ape in the same tent as his foreign guests for the night. As the festivities take place, Spense and his men capture the submarine which brought the Axis leaders to Norom. While investigating the High Chief's camp soon afterwards, Spense runs into Benson, who reveals to him the presence of the three most important Axis leaders on this island. Carrying on his plan, Benson wakes Suki Yaki from his unconsciousness and, with the general's help, manages to convince Hitler and Mussolini that Paj Mub intends to betray them. After making it back to the submarine, Hitler demonstrates his gratitude to Benson by punching him off the vessel, but he is surreptitiously pulled out of the water by his crewmates, who keep themselves hidden from the Axis leaders as they enter the boat for the return journey. As the submarine is underway, the radio operator receives a message that an Allied refugee ship was torpedoed and its passengers massacred, lifting Hitler's mood. Enraged, Benson attempts to teach Hitler a hard lesson, but Spense prevents him from doing so, citing the Geneva Convention's clause of prisoner of war treatment. Benson relents from employing force, but then locks Hitler's cabin door and falsely announces through the intercom that the submarine is sinking, sending the Axis leaders into hysterics for a while, before he cheerfully reveals the Americans' presence on the boat. However, Popoff has in the meantime gone mad from Hitler's promise of getting shot for his supposed failure with Paj Mub. He smashes the sub's navigation instruments when he is left unattended, leaving the sailors blind in the sea. The sub runs aground, nose in the air, at the shore of a tropical island. Thinking that the sub is trapped underwater, the desperate Axis leaders decide to have themselves shot to the surface via the torpedo tubes. The film ends with Benson and Spense beholding Hitler, Suki Yaki and Mussolini being stuck headfirst in the island beach's sands, with their feet treading empty air.

This gourd-resonating musical bow likely has common roots with the Brazilian berimbau, due to constant trade between Asia and South America in the nineteenth century, during which the instrument may have been introduced to the Chamorro people. The instrument also resembles various zither/boat lutes found throughout Southeast Asia (esp. in the Philippines) called kutiyapi.  Description  The eleaotua has traditionally been part of wedding and other ceremonies in Guam, such as the Chamorro Month celebrations in schools, though it has lost popularity in recent times. The name of the instrument comes from the words eleao ('swaying of the trees' in Chamorro) and tuyan (Chamorro for 'stomach') \\"tua\\" for short. Similar to other gourd-resonating musical bows, such as the berimbau or hungu, the gourd can be made to resonate by pressing it against one's stomach cavity and the player can create a vibrato by moving the gourd towards and away their body.  Construction  It is made by attaching a string to a long flat wooden stick, on top of which is a resonating gourd. The string is usually made of metal wire or hard string, and similar material is used to keep the resonating gourd in place, stopping the string which allows to produce two pitches (lower and higher) by hitting the longer or shorter sides of the stopped string respectively. At the ends of the wooden stick are placed seashells in order to produce a clearer sound. The length of the wooden stick can be between 4 ft (1.2m) and 9 ft (2.7m) long. As heavy wire was not easily found in Guam in the past, instrument makers would use wire from rubber tires. The wood used for the body of the instrument has usually been Pacific Rosewood or hibiscus tree, both of which grow locally. Wood of young trees has been preferred, as it is more flexible and easier to bend, and a wider body is used to produce a better sound. The gourd has usually been made of coconut or tagua, and they produce different sound: though coconut shells are easy to handle, they are much smaller, harder, and are prone to cracking. The thin hitting stick is made out of bamboo and is usually about a foot (0.3m) long. The string used on the instrument has traditionally been made of wild pineapple fibre, whereas now it has been replaced by metal wires, which produce a louder and brighter sound.

Plot Police Lieutenant Sam Carson spots Walter Bard's bullet-ridden corpse in a car brazenly left in front of the police station. Carson questions Janet Bradley after finding her name in the dead man's appointment book. She admits that Bard had been blackmailing her friend for $20,000, and that she went to see him, though she had been able to raise only half the money. When he refused to settle for that, she claims she took what she came for at gunpoint. Max Calvert, a newspaper owner, pressures Carson to arrest Bradley to hurt her father's election campaign for mayor. Carson declines. When Dr. Yager, the corrupt medical examiner, informs Calvert that Bard actually died from poison, Calvert orders him to get the body out of the police station and substitute another corpse for it before anyone else finds out. Meanwhile, Carson interviews Bard's estranged wife, Nora, who is accompanied by her lawyer and boyfriend, Arthur Templeton. Complications ensue when a prisoner pulls his own switch, taking the place of Bard's body to escape from the police station in an ambulance. Johnny Williams, the new reporter on the police beat, finds the missing body in a closet. He gets a scoop for his newspaper, and Carson gets his corpse back. The lieutenant notices there is very little blood for a fatal gunshot, so he orders another autopsy, by someone other than Yager. Then Nora Bard and Arthur Templeton voluntarily confess to him that they lied before. Nora was in her husband's apartment when he died. She had gone to plead for a divorce, and hid in another room when Janet Bradley arrived. After Janet left, Nora found Walter dying after drinking some liquor. When she ran out, she was seen by Templeton. He went into the apartment, assumed Nora had committed the crime, and staged the fake suicide to protect her. Noticing a fresh flower among Bard's effects, Carson questions flower seller Flossie. She mentions that when she went to try to collect what Bard owed her, she saw Yager unlock and enter Bard's apartment. Carson confronts Yager. Knowing that Bard had been investigating Yager for a malpractice suit, the policeman guesses that Yager stole the evidence Bard had found and poisoned the liquor. Yager makes a break for it, but is caught. At Detective Oppenheimer's suggestion, Carson then takes Janet Bradley out. Cast * Carole Landis as Janet Bradley * William Gargan as Lt.

The Koizumi Children are loosely organized into a political association called . The term is a reference to then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, with whom the LDP success in the 2005 elections is closely associated. Some of the children were so-called 'assassins,' candidates hand-picked by Koizumi to defeat LDP party members who opposed his efforts at postal reform. As such, the children are popularly associated with Koizumi's reform-minded policies. Koichi Yamauchi, one of the children, has described the term as \\"essentially meaningless,\\" arguing that differences among the group such as faction membership and personal background make any description of the children as a group problematic. In the following 2009 general election, only 10 of the 83 Koizumi Children were re-elected. The 2009 election saw a massive defeat for the ruling LDP and brought the opposition DPJ to power for the first time. Ironically, most of these Koizumi Children were defeated in their districts by candidates who were \\"parachuted\\" in by the DPJ and others in a style much like the LDP once adopted. The election also saw a number of young DPJ politicians, all handpicked by DPJ election strategist Ichirō Ozawa, sent to \\"assassinate\\" vulnerable LDP seats and subsequently elected in the same manner as the Koizumi Children. As such, these DPJ Diet members were dubbed the \\"Ozawa Children\\".

The station has two sidewalk extensions which serve as side platforms, with a mini-high platform on each for accessibility. History The San Francisco Municipal Railway opened its M Ocean View line on October 6, 1925 as a shuttle service between St. Francis Circle and Broad Street at Plymouth Avenue, where a crossover was located to allow streetcars to reverse direction. From October 31, 1927 to February 27, 1928, through service to Ferry Loop was available. The line was replaced with buses on August 6, 1939, but streetcar service resumed on December 17, 1944; through service to the East Bay Terminal began on June 6, 1948. In 1951-52, Muni acquired a fleet of new PCC streetcars - the first Muni streetcars with a cab at only one end. These single-ended cars required a loop or wye to turn around at terminals, as they could not simply reverse direction. A wye was constructed at Broad and Plymouth; it was put in service on December 6, 1957, with PCC streetcars entering M Ocean View service on December 23. After a four-year bus substitution from 1974 to 1978 for conversion to Muni Metro, the line was extended to the carhouses at Balboa Park station in 1980. All service was extended to Balboa Park on August 30, but cut back to Broad and Plymouth on October 3 due to track problems on the extension. Weekday service to Balboa Park with LRVs resumed on December 17, though PCC streetcars continued to use the wye at Plymouth Avenue as the weekend terminal. Weekend service to Balboa Park with LRVs began on September 19, 1982. The wye at Plymouth Avenue was removed in 1986; the switches were moved to 17th Street at Noe Street for use during the San Francisco Historic Trolley Festival. A crossover, which is only used for occasional short turns, was later installed east of Plymouth Avenue.

Football career Smith was born in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire and played his early football for Ashton Athletic and Ashton Town in their pre- league era. In May 1897, he joined Preston North End where another player of the same name was already playing, also as an outside-forward. Smith made four appearances in the Football League First Division, plus one in the FA Cup, before Preston made both players available at the end of the season. The directors of Southampton agreed to sign him, apparently under the misapprehension that they were signing the other player, who had established a reputation for being a \\"star\\". (The other Tom Smith went on to have a long career with Tottenham Hotspur, including scoring the second goal as the \\"Spurs\\" defeated Sheffield United to win the 1901 FA Cup Final.) At the \\"Saints\\", Smith won the 100 yard sprint in the club's annual sports day, encouraging the directors to believe that they had signed the right player. The \\"Saints\\" were about to embark on their first season in their new stadium and Smith made his debut for Southampton in the opening match at The Dell, against Brighton United on 3 September 1898. Smith scored the final goal in a 4–1 victory - the goal was described as \\"just such a goal as there is no doubt about – a shot which beats the goalkeeper almost before it is made\\". Despite this auspicious start, Smith's subsequent indifferent form led the directors to realise that they had acquired the services of the wrong player, and by February Smith had lost his place, initially to Tom Nicol and then to Jimmy Yates. Smith left the Saints in the summer of 1899, to join Queens Park Rangers for their first season in the Southern League.

Patel (born 12 July 1953 in Mufulira) is a Zambian politician of Hindu Indian origin. His ancestral roots traces back to Gujarat, India. He served long tenures both as a legislator and as the Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Industry. Career Patel was elected in 1991 to the National Assembly of Zambia under the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) in the Lusaka Central constituency. During this time he was also a member of the MMD's national executive committee. He was appointed Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry from 1991 to 1992, then held a succession of Cabinet Minister positions in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (1992), the Ministry of Youth, Sports, and Child Development (1992–1993), and the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry (1993–1996). He was one of two cabinet-level members of Indian origin in President Frederick Chiluba's government, the other being Minister of Agriculture Suresh Desai. However, he resigned from that last position in February 1996 due to disagreements with Chiluba; specifically, he objected to a proposed constitutional amendment which would bar individuals of \\"foreign parentage\\" from contesting the presidency. In the 1996 elections, he ran without any party affiliation and was returned to his seat representing Lusaka Central; in the 2001 elections he ran on the Forum for Democracy and Development ticket and was again elected. Relations with Mwanawasa In 2002, while a lawmaker, Patel received a police summons for having allegedly insulted Levy Mwanawasa, who was elected president in the 2001 election; defaming the head of state is a criminal offence under Zambian law and may incur a jail sentence of up to three years. The Zambia Post had published a quotation by Patel in which he called Mwanawasa a \\"cabbage\\", a reference to Mwanawasa's alleged rigging of the presidential election. Police also arrested the Post editor Fred M'membe, but M'membe himself believed Patel was the police's real target. However, Mwanawasa appointed Patel to the position of Cabinet Minister in the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Industry in February 2003, in a surprise move which also saw a number of other opposition lawmakers named to his cabinet. During his tenure under Mwanawasa, Patel served as Chair-Co-ordinator for the Least Developed Countries World Trade Organization negotiations in 2005. Patel later changed his opinion of Mwanawasa, and after the latter's death praised him for his independence, stating that \\"Everyone thought he was going to be Chiluba’s puppet, but he showed very quickly that he took orders from no one\\".

Produced by Cine Suerte Productions and Oasis of Love Movement (by Fr. Sonny Ramirez, OP, host of the telemagazine Sharing in the City), Kristo stars Mat Ranillo III in the title role, together with Rez Cortez (Judas Iscariot), Ruel Vernal (Peter), Michael Locsin (John), freelance model and then college student Charmaine Rivera (in her first and only film appearance as the Virgin Mary), and Amy Austria (Mary Magdalene). The film also includes an all-star cast in their cameo appearances playing various characters. Among them are Gabby Concepción (John the Baptist), husband-and-wife pair Rudy Fernandez and Lorna Tolentino (as Simon of Cyrene and Veronica respectively), Aga Muhlach (the demon-possessed man), Rachel Lobangco (the Temptress, in which Satan is in a female form in the temptation of the desert scene), Silvia Sanchez (the adulteress), Ang TV star and singer Lindsay Custodio (Salome), and Christopher de Leon (as Dimas as credited in the film). Plot The film started on a prologue, \\"if the story of the New Testament replaced the setting from the Middle East to the Philippine Islands, what would the image and culture of the New Testament look like?\\" The narrative of Kristo is based on the combined Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, but imagined as occurring in Classical Filipino society with ethnic elements and some aspects of Ancient Rome and first-century Judaea. Kristo was shot in various locations such as Intramuros, Lawton and Luneta in Manila, as well as in Laguna and Pampanga. The film starts with an open book presenting the Nativity of Jesus in the form of illustrations. Live action scenes or the flow of the story follows the next page 30 years after, beginning with the preaching of John the Baptist and the Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan. Kristo cycles through the various episodes in Christ's ministry, his death, and resurrection, ending with his ascension and its illustrated version on the last page with a Biblical message.

The son of one of the co-founders of the Wiener Sport-Club, Proksch took an active interest in both athletics and graphic design from an early age. By the age of 19 he had started his own design company and would later become a founder, then president, of the Confederation of Austrian Graphic Designers. He was also a key figure in the founding of Icograda. By the age of 17, Proksch was a champion pole vaulter and competed internationally, most notably placing 6th in the event at the 1936 Summer Olympics. He broke the Austrian record for the event on eight separate occasions. Even after turning 100, he continued to compete at the World's Masters Championships, often unopposed in his age bracket. Having won 14 gold medals at the games after 1994, he was considered the world's oldest active athlete. He was one of the last two known surviving track and field competitors from the 1936 Olympic Games to still be competing (the other being Ljubica Gabric-Calvesi). Early life Proksch was born on December 11, 1908, in Vienna to Ignaz Proksch and Henriette Gaugusch. His father was a secretary to the House of Schwarzenberg and, although his family was initially poor, they became better off financially after World War I. He attended boarding school with his four brothers and, by the age of 15, was already earning money as an illustrator under the pseudonym Fedor Broskow. He worked at various jobs designing posters until 1926, when he entered the University of Applied Arts Vienna. He later took courses at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.Kern, Anita.

Das grafische Werk.Amalthea Signum Verlag Professional career and Olympics In 1927, at the age of 19, Proksch started his own design company and was one of the original 10 founders of the Confederation of Austrian Graphic Designers (now Design Austria). He was for a time in the 1960s President of the Confederation of Austrian Graphic Designers. He encountered hardships, however, with the onset of the Great Depression and experienced difficulties in finding work. In 1933 he married Ida Moser, a fashion designer and model, and had four children with her. Proksch's father was one of the co-founders of the Wiener Sport-Club and encouraged his son to participate in athletic activities. At the age of 17 he was the Vienna Youth Champion and over the course of his career he set the Austrian record in the pole vault eight times. At the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin he placed 6th in the Men's Pole Vault competition with a height of 4.00m. He set his personal best at this event on August 2, 1937, in London with a height of 4.115. Later life and World's Masters Championships Proksch served during World War II in Russia, France and Albania. At the end of the war he hid in Waldviertel and Spitz, working low-key jobs as a graphic designer, before settling in Eichgraben in 1947. In 1963 he was present at the meeting that helped found what has become the world body for professional communication design and visual communication, Icograda. Awarded the title of \\"Professor\\" in 1967, he retired from graphic design at the age of 70. His son Peter Proksch is also a painter and graphic designer. From 1955 to 2005 he was President of the Vienna Cricket and Football-Club. Through 2009, Proksch continued to compete in athletics tournaments and lived on his own, his wife having died in the 1980s. Between 1994 and 2009 he won 14 gold medals, as well as one silver, in the World's Masters Championships, in the discus, shot put and javelin throw events. In 2009 he had cardiac surgery after a heart attack, as well as knee surgery, but nevertheless continued to participate in shot put events, winning gold medals in discus and shot put (with a distance of 2.8m) at the 2009 World's Masters Championships in Lahti as the only competitor in the 100+ age bracket. He was the Austrian Athletics Association's oldest athlete and was considered the world's oldest active athlete. Proksch was also a painter, and his works were displayed from December 9 to 23, 2008, and from January 13 to 31, 2009, in a gallery in Vienna in honour of his 100th birthday. He was made honorary president for life of Design Austria. He died on January 3, 2011, at the age of 102.

It can reach a height of . Various segments of the tree are used in traditional medicine. Description The large leaf stalks wither and fall off the tree and collect near the base of the trunk, appearing to look like a pile of broken limb bones. The pinnate leaves are approximately in length and comparably wide, borne on petioles or stalks up to in length, making this the largest of all dicot tree leaves, which are quadripinnate (leaflets display four orders of branching). The tree is a night-bloomer and flowers are adapted to natural pollination by bats. They form enormous seed pods - the fruits - are up to long that hang down from bare branches, resembling swords. The long fruits curve downward and resemble the wings of a large bird or dangling sickles or swords in the night, giving the name \\"tree of Damocles\\". The seeds are round with papery wings. Distribution Ooroxylum indicum is native to the Indian subcontinent, the Himalayan foothills with a part extending to Bhutan and southern China, Indochina and the Malesia regions. In Vietnam, the tree is called núc nác (sometimes sò đo), and specimens can be found in Cat Tien National Park. It is visible in the forest biome of Manas National Park in Assam, India. It is found, raised and planted in large number in the forest areas of the Banswara district in the state of Rajasthan in India. It is reported in the list of rare, endangered and threatened plants of Kerala (South India). It is also found in Sri Lanka.Theobald, W.L. (1981). Bignoniace. In: Dassanayake, M.D. and Fosberg, F.R.

Ecology Oroxylum indicum lives in relationship with the actinomycete Pseudonocardia oroxyli present in the soil surrounding the roots. Septobasidium bogoriense is a fungal species responsible for velvet blight in O. indicum. Phytochemistry Various segments of O. indicum, including leaves, root bark, heartwood, and seeds, contain diverse phytochemicals, such as prunetin, sitosterol, oroxindin, oroxylin-A, biochanin-A, ellagic acid, tetuin, anthraquinone, and emodin. Several of the compounds are under preliminary research to identify their potential biological properties. Uses The tree is often grown as an ornamental plant for its strange appearance. Materials used include the wood, tannins and dyestuffs. In marriage rituals The plant is used by the Kirat, Sunuwar, Rai, Limbu, Yakha, Tamang in Nepal, the Thai in Thailand and the Lao in Laos. In the Himalayas, people hang sculptures or garlands made from O. indicum (Skr. shyonaka) seeds from the roof of their homes in belief they provide protection. As food It is a plant with edible leaves and stems. The large young pods, known as Lin mai or Lin fa in Loei, are eaten especially in Thailand and Laos. They are first grilled over charcoal fire and then the bitter inner pulp is usually scraped and eaten along with lap.Thai Dishes, Central Part And South Known as karongkandai among the Bodos of north east India, its flowers and fruit are eaten as a bitter side dish with rice.

It was also featured on the movie-mocking program Mystery Science Theater 3000. Plot Eddy Crane is the leader of a gang that robs small businesses for petty cash. At one point, his gang accosts the broken-down car of a music business executive, Harry Bayliss. Afterward Bayliss wishes to call a tow truck, so he goes into the diner where Eddy's gang is celebrating. Bayliss overhears Eddy singing to the jukebox and offers him a chance to audition for his variety program. Eddy accepts, passes his audition, and is given a spot on television. Eddy sings a two-minute song that is apparently stupendously successful, with Bayliss calling Eddy an \\"overnight sensation\\" and prophesying an astounding rise to fame, complete with a hit record, \\"a guest spot on every top show,\\" and eventually culminating with \\"The Eddy Crane Show.\\" Atop Eddy's newfound success, he also immediately begins making advances at Bayliss's secretary, Helen Tracy, in preference over his long-suffering girlfriend, Iris. The specter of Eddy's stardom raises dissension among his gang, who wish either to accompany him unquestionably on his ascent, or to hold him back in their ranks. Iris is also jealous of Helen, with whom Eddy has been carrying on an affair. Helen eventually professes her love for Eddy. But one of Eddy's gang members, Moon, kills a fat barkeep, threatening to drag Eddy down by association. Moon runs from the police, but is tracked down by Eddy, who delivers him for arrest. With this he also definitively separates himself from the rest of his gang and from Iris, but also destroys his prospects for a career as a singer with his own arrest.

The team parachutes in and soon after arriving Falken is recognised by a local woman who reports them to her German lover and Dalberg, a Quisling. A team is sent to capture them but after they overpower their captors and free the general from the prison camp they are soon being pursued by the German authorities. Once on the road in a captured German car they are attacked and forced to take shelter after Heden is hurt. They send Falken to get assistance from a doctor but he is betrayed once again by the same woman whom he had known when growing up in his hometown. The Germans take Falken alive and, pretending to be the doctor they requested, capture Owen near the house they are hiding in. Hall manages to keep Heden in safety in the house. Owen misleads the Germans about their escape plans and after the Germans have realised their mistake they are surprised to find that the two prisoners have been freed by Dalberg. Owen and Falken manage to return to Hall and Heden and the party moves off to rendezvous with the incoming commandos and Royal Navy boats. The film includes real footage from British Commando raids on German occupying forces in Norway in March and December of 1941.  Main cast  *Lyle Talbot as Capt.

She is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and in 2014 was called as a member of the church's general board of the Young Women organization.  Early life and education  Lindberg was born in Cuba, and educated in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the United States. Her father was Cuban and her mother was a Puerto Rican U.S. citizen; as a result, Lindberg was born a dual citizen of Cuba and the United States. In 1960, she, her mother, and her brother were forced to leave Cuba; her father was forced to remain in Cuba. In 1963, Lindberg's family came to the U.S., settling in New Rochelle, New York. She and her family were introduced to the LDS Church through the Mormon exhibit at the New York World's Fair. By that time her father had also left Cuba. Following high school, Lindberg attended Brigham Young University (BYU), where she received a bachelor's degree in Communications, and the University of Utah where she received a master's degree in Educational Psychology in 1973, a master's degree in Social Work in 1978 and a Ph.D in Health Sciences in 1980. During—and following—her graduate schooling at the University of Utah, Lindberg worked for various State of Utah agencies. As part of her work, she became intrigued with the analytical approach used in the law. Lindberg received a scholarship to BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School. She graduated magna cum laude, placing second in her class. She served as an articles editor for the BYU Law Review.  Judicial career  Following graduation from law school, Lindberg served as a law clerk for Monroe G. McKay of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and for Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the Supreme Court of the United States. Following her clerkships, Lindberg practiced as an appellate and healthcare lawyer in the Washington, D.C. offices of two national law firms. In 1995 Lindberg returned to Utah and worked as in-house counsel for a subsidiary of Aetna Life and Casualty Company.Debra Weyerman, Answer Them Nothing: Bringing Down the Polygamous Empire of Warren Jeffs (Chicago Review Press, 2011) p. 187 Lindberg was appointed as a district judge to Utah's Third Judicial District bench in 1998 by Utah Governor Mike Leavitt.

It describes the traditional shamanistic religion of the Gurung people of Nepal. Deprecated terms Gurung shamanism has been often cited in scholarly texts as well as Hindu world of thought as Gurung dharma, but the latter term is considered inaccurate as it is not considered a form of dharma by its adherents, but rather an ancient shamanistic belief system. Description Gurung villages have their own local deities. Gurung shamanism ascribes fundamental symbolic significance to death. The rites, called pae (also pai and pe), are often shamanistic analogs or complements to Tibetan Buddhist rituals. The funerary rite is the central ceremony, entailing three days and two nights of rituals to send souls to the Land of the Ancestors. These rituals may be officiated by either Klehpri, Pachyu, or Bonpo Lamas (pre-Buddhist lamas). Among the Gurung, death involves the dissolution of bodily elements – earth, air, fire, and water. These elements are released in a series of rituals, nine for men and seven for women. One ritual in the freeing of souls involves a \\"Klehpri\\" injecting the spirit of the deceased through a string into a bird, which then appears to recognize family members and otherwise act unnaturally. The bird is symbolically sacrificed with the plucking of a few feathers, received by family members, after which the bird is released. Once in the Land of the Ancestors, life continues much as in this world, however the spirit is able to take other incarnations. From the Land of the Ancestors, spirits continue to take an interest in their surviving kinsmen, able to work good and evil in the realm of the living. According to Gurung shamanism, the dead are either cremated or buried. After the cremation or burial, the family of the deceased constructs a small shrine on a hill to offer food to the spirit, which remains and may cause misfortune. Sons of the deceased observe mourning for six to twelve months, during which they fast from meat and alcohol. A final funerary ceremony takes places a year or more after death, for which an expensive funeral rite is performed. This rite includes an effigy (called a pla) of the deceased, draped in white cloth and decorated with ornaments. The death rituals close as klehpri addresses the spirit and sends it to its resting place, after which the hilltop shrine is dismantled. Further rites ensue, during which the priest recites supplications to the \\"spirits of the four directions\\" for kind treatment as the deceased makes his way to the spirit realm, advises the departing soul on its choice between reincarnation and remaining in the Land of Ancestors, and admonishes it to stay away from its worldly cares and not to return prematurely. Priesthood Gurungs employ three categories of priesthood – Ghyapri, Pachyu and Lama – each following different practices The ghyabri are involved with funerary rituals and play drums and large brass cymbals. The ghyabri have no sacred literature, learning all prayers and rituals by heart over several years. These sacred oral scriptures are called Pye tan Lu tan. The sacred language, Gurung-kura, is no longer understood by laity nor practitioners, and may be derived from an ancient religion. Shamans called pachyu operate in Gurung communities and in tribal and Hindu communities of Nepal, being most numerous in the Modi Valley. Their practice is largely in the realm of interpreting the supernatural. While their ritual language is also archaic, it is more readily understood by practitioners and laity. Practices of pachyu have been influenced by Buddhist teaching, and they are often associated in various rites with lamas. They are also believed to communicate with spirits and local deities and are often employed by persons suffering illnesses or misfortunes to draw up horoscopes. Both pachyu and ghyabri/klehpri are called upon to exorcise possessed people, perform mortuary rites, and officiate ancestor worship. Influence of Buddhism Centuries of cultural influence from Tibet resulted in many Gurungs gradually embracing Tibetan Buddhism over the centuries, especially the Nyingma school, and particularly among Gurungs in the Manang region. Gurungs generally believe in Buddha and bodhisattvas. Mainstream Tibetan Buddhist lamas harbor ambivalent opinions about Gurung Dharma (Pye Ta Lu Ta) practices, and syncretic Gurung Dharma may be reluctant to disclose their practices to outsiders. According to the 2001 Nepal Census, 69.03% of the ethnic Gurung identified as Buddhists, 28.75% as Hindus, and 0.66% as Christians.

In nonlinear resonance the system behaviour – resonance frequencies and modes – depends on the amplitude of the oscillations, while for linear systems this is independent of amplitude. Description Generically two types of resonances have to be distinguished – linear and nonlinear. From the physical point of view, they are defined by whether or not external force coincides with the eigen-frequency of the system (linear and nonlinear resonance correspondingly). The frequency condition of nonlinear resonance reads : \\\\omega_n=\\\\omega_{1}+ \\\\omega_{2}+ \\\\cdots + \\\\omega_{n-1}, with possibly different \\\\omega_i=\\\\omega(\\\\mathbf{k}_i), being eigen-frequencies of the linear part of some nonlinear partial differential equation. Here \\\\mathbf{k}_i is a vector with the integer subscripts i being indexes into Fourier harmonics – or eigenmodes – see Fourier series. Accordingly, the frequency resonance condition is equivalent to a Diophantine equation with many unknowns. The problem of finding their solutions is equivalent to the Hilbert's tenth problem that is proven to be algorithmically unsolvable. Main notions and results of the theory of nonlinear resonances are: # The use of the special form of dispersion functions \\\\omega=\\\\omega(\\\\mathbf{k}), appearing in various physical applications allows to find the solutions of frequency resonance condition. # The set of resonances for given dispersion function and the form of resonance conditions is partitioned into non-intersecting resonance clusters; dynamics of each cluster can be studied independently (at the appropriate time-scale). # Each resonance cluster can be represented by its NR-diagram which is a plane graph of the special structure. This representation allows to reconstruct uniquely 3a) dynamical system describing time-dependent behavior of the cluster, and 3b) the set of its polynomial conservation laws which are generalization of Manley–Rowe constants of motion for the simplest clusters (triads and quartets) # Dynamical systems describing some types of the clusters can be solved analytically. # These theoretical results can be used directly for describing real-life physical phenomena (e.g. intraseasonal oscillations in the Earth's atmosphere) or various wave turbulent regimes in the theory of wave turbulence. Nonlinear resonance shift Foldover effect Nonlinear effects may significantly modify the shape of the resonance curves of harmonic oscillators. First of all, the resonance frequency \\\\omega is shifted from its \\"natural\\" value \\\\omega_0 according to the formula :\\\\omega=\\\\omega_0+\\\\kappa A^2, where A is the oscillation amplitude and \\\\kappa is a constant defined by the anharmonic coefficients. Second, the shape of the resonance curve is distorted (foldover effect). When the amplitude of the (sinusoidal) external force F reaches a critical value F_\\\\mathrm{crit} instabilities appear. The critical value is given by the formula :F_\\\\mathrm{crit}=\\\\frac{4 m^2\\\\omega_0^2\\\\gamma^3}{3\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\kappa}, where m is the oscillator mass and \\\\gamma is the damping coefficient. Furthermore, new resonances appear in which oscillations of frequency close to \\\\omega_0 are excited by an external force with frequency quite different from \\\\omega_0. Nonlinear frequency response functions Generalized frequency response functions, and nonlinear output frequency response functions Billings S.A. \\"Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains\\". Wiley, 2013 allow the user to study complex nonlinear behaviors in the frequency domain in a principled way. These functions reveal resonance ridges, harmonic, inter modulation, and energy transfer effects in a way that allows the user to relate these terms from complex nonlinear discrete and continuous time models to the frequency domain and vice versa.

Its mission was the establishment of toponyms for places, villages, towns and cities in the former eastern territories of Germany (then known in Poland as the Regained Territories).. Background Territory and population new Polish-German border in 1945 According to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference most of the former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were placed under Polish administration and most of the remaining German population was expelled. Some of those territories had historical ties with Poland, dating to the medieval fragmentation of Poland in the Duchy of Silesia, but were also populated by German-speaking inhabitants for many centuries. According to the 1939 German census, the territories were inhabited by 8,855,000 people, including a Polish minority in the territories' easternmost parts. The Polish minority included Masurs in Masuria (former southern East Prussia), Kashubians and Slovincians in Pomerania, and Silesians in Upper Silesia - these groups were referred to as \\"autochthons\\" after the war, and used to prove a \\"Polishness\\" of the territories. While the German census placed the number of Polish-speakers and bilinguals below 700,000 people, Polish demographers have estimated that the actual number of Poles in the former German East was between 1.2 and 1.3 million. In the 1.2 million figure, approximately 850,000 were estimated for the Upper Silesian regions, 350,000 for southern East Prussia (Masuria) and 50,000 for the rest of the territories. While the Germans were interned and expelled, close to 5 million settlers \\\\-- 4.55 million in the first years \\\\-- 4,79 million as of 1950 were either attracted or forced to settle the areas between 1945 and 1950. An additional 1,104,000 people had declared Polish nationality and were allowed to stay (851,000 of those in Upper Silesia), bringing up the number of Poles to 5,894,600 as of 1950. The Polish government aimed to retain as many \\"autochthons\\" as possible for propaganda purposes, as their presence on former German soil was used to indicate the intrinsic \\"Polishness\\" of the area and justify its incorporation into the Polish state as \\"recovered\\" territories. The Polish authorities often referred to the medieval Polish state to emphasize the validity of the Polish historical claim to these lands and began to call the area the Recovered Territories. The arriving Polish administration and settlers faced the problem of a consistent and unambiguous usage of toponyms. Former toponyms When the area was settled by Germans during the medieval Ostsiedlung, they either introduced new German toponyms or adopted pre-existing ones, which were of Baltic or West Slavic origin—Baltic Old Prussian and Slavic Pomeranian in the North, and Slavic Silesian and Slavic Polish in the South. In bi- and multi- lingual areas such as Upper Silesia, German and Slavic (including Polish) variants often existed for the same toponym, derived either from a Slavic root (e.g., Opole—Oppeln) or a German root (e.g., Reichenbach—Rychbach). Beginning with the 19th-century Kulturkampf, many toponyms with Slavic roots were renamed to sound more German. In 1938, many place names of Slavic or Old Prussian origin in East Prussia and Silesia were renamed to purely \\"German\\" toponyms by the Nazi-German administration. These renamings intensified during World War II, when Nazi Germany sought to eradicate Polish culture. Early Renaming in 1945 Initially there were several ways of naming like continuing to use the German names, pronouncing and spelling the German names in a more Polish way (Zechow→Czechów, Boyadel→Bojadła, Poberow→Pobierowo, Grabow→Grabowo); a literal translation of the German names (Eichberg→Dębogóra (oak mountain), Grünwalde→Zielenica (Green wood), Linde→Lipka (linden); giving names according to the places topographical characters (Górki→mountainous); giving names honouring a local person or event (e.g. Sensburg→Mrągowo, to commemorate Christoph Mrongovius, Lötzen→Giżycko, to commemorate Gustaw Gizewiusz, Rastenburg→Kętrzyn, to commemorate Wojciech Kętrzyński) or adopting the name of the settler's homeland. Another purpose was to restore a historical Polish (or Slavic) name that dated to pre-Germanization times. Spared from the expulsion of Germans from Poland were about 900,000 Masurians and Silesians, usually speaking Polish and Silesian dialects mixed with German loanwords. Accordingly these groups had their own, traditional Masurian or Silesian names for various toponyms (e.g. Johannisburg→Jańsbork, Rastenburg→Rastembork, Lötzen→Lec, Liegnitz→Lignica). Often however these names didn't comply with the maxims of the Committee and were usually not considered. Hence the decisions of the Committee were not always accepted by the local population, which sometimes protested against the new names with boycotts and even demolition of road signs. The locals rated the actions of the Committee rather as Polonisation against their will. In other cases the arriving Polish settlers requested not to use the Committee's suggestion but e.g. to name a village after the settler's first-born child (Stefanówka for Nieder Giersdorf/Miłochów). In many cases a single place had three or even four names and even administrative districts (Voivodships) like the area of the former Free City of Danzig had four different names: morskie, kaszubskie, gdańskie and wiślane. Sometimes even different administrative branches like the municipal office, the local office and the railway administration used different names, e.g. modern Dzierżoniów in Lower Silesia was called Rychbach, Reichenbach and Drobniszew at the same time. This problem was later solved by naming the town in memory of Jan Dzierzon. 1945 conference In early April 1945, the Regional Bureau of the National Railway Administration in Poznań founded a commission for the standardization of place names along the Oder River. This initiative was supported by the Western Institute and Poznań University, which in July 1945 published a bilingual Słowniczek nazw miejscowych (Small Dictionary of Place Names). Again on the initiative of the Regional Railway Administration in Poznań, the first Onomastic Conference was organized at Szczecin and held on 11–13 September 1945, attended by 37 representatives of Poznań University, the Western Institute, the Baltic Institute in Gdańsk (which had just moved there from Toruń) and the administrations of Szczecin, Poznań and Gdańsk, as well as members of information and propaganda institutions and the postal service. The Conference achieved a general consensus for a systematic method of considering place names: * To be used as a principal source was Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich (Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland and of Other Slavic Countries), which had been published in the late nineteenth century. * If a name had several forms in medieval sources, the one that was nearest to the contemporary written Polish should be adopted. * Translation of German names into Polish should be avoided. * With ancient names, the first two declension cases and the adjectival form should be provided in the interest of correct usage. * In cases when there were only German names, Slavic names in the neighboring area could be adopted. If there were no nearby Slavic names, the name of the new settlers' former native area could be adopted, with a slight modification. The Commission Pursuant to this, in January 1946 a Commission for the Determination of Place Names (Komisja Ustalania Nazw Miejscowości) was founded as a commission of the Department of Public Administration. It comprised a chair and 6 commission members, including three scholars and three officials of the Departments of Transportation, Posts and Defense. The first chairman was the geographer and former director of the Baltic Institute, Stanisław Srokowski. The other commission members were the linguists Kazimierz Nitsch, Mikołaj Rudnicki, Stanisław Rospond and Witold Taszycki; a specialist in toponyms; and the historian Władysław Semkowicz. The Commission coordinated the work of local institutions such as the Western Institute in Poznań, the Silesian Institute in Katowice, and the Baltic Institute in Gdańsk. Three regional subcommissions were founded, each responsible for a given area: *Kraków Commission I: responsible for Silesia; *Kraków Commission II: responsible for the former East Prussia and Free City of Danzig; and the *Poznań Commission: responsible for the former Farther Pomerania and Neumark. The subcommissions prepared recommendations for the Commission, which ultimately endorsed up to 98 per cent of their proposals, which were often based on prewar publications of the Western Institute, such as Stanisław Kozierowski's Atlas nazw geograficznych Słowiańszczyzny Zachodniej (Atlas of Geographical Names of Western Slavdom). Following approval by the Commission, a place name had to be accepted by the Departments of Public Administration and of the Recovered Territories, and finally was published in the Monitor Polski (Polish Monitor). The Commission's first conference took place on 2–4 March 1946. It decided the names of voivodships and 220 cities, counties, transportation crossroads, and towns with populations over 5,000. The second conference, on 1–3 June 1946, dealt with towns with populations between 1,000 and 5,000; and the third, on 26 September 8 October 1946 decided the names of villages with a population between 500 and 1,000. By the end of 1946, the Commission had adopted about 4,400 place names; and by June 1947, nearly all names of stations and settlements with a population of over 500. By the end of 1950, a total of 32,138 place names had been determined by the Commission. After the Commission's chairman, Stanisław Srokowski, died in 1950, the village of Drengfurt, which had initially been renamed \\"Dryfort\\", was changed to \\"Srokowo\\". At present Currently there are two commissions in Poland, tasked with standardization of toponyms: Komisja Nazw Miejscowości i Obiektów Fizjograficznych (the Commission for Names of Places and Physiographic Objects) and Komisja Standaryzacji Nazw Geograficznych (the Commission for Standardization of Geographic Names).

S. Van Dine. Directed by Michael Curtiz for Warner Bros., it stars William Powell and Mary Astor. Powell's role as Philo Vance is not the actor's first performance as the aristocratic sleuth; he also portrays the character in three films produced by Paramount in 1929 and 1930. Plot When Philo Vance's dog does not make it into the final of the Long Island Kennel Club's dog show, fellow competitor Archer Coe (Robert Barrat) is disappointed, having hoped to savor a victory over Vance. The next morning Coe is found dead, locked inside his bedroom. District Attorney Markham (Robert McWade) and Police Sergeant Heath (Eugene Pallette) assume it was suicide, because Coe was shot through the head and was found holding a pistol. Vance is not convinced. He soon finds evidence that Coe was murdered. Coroner Dr. Doremus (Etienne Girardot) determines the victim had bled to death internally from a stab wound. There is no shortage of suspects; Coe was very much disliked. His niece Hilda Lake (Mary Astor) resented her uncle's tight control of her finances and jealousy of any men who showed interest in her. Her boyfriend, Sir Thomas MacDonald (Paul Cavanagh), suspected Coe of killing his dog to ensure winning the competition. Raymond Wrede (Ralph Morgan), the dead man's secretary, was in love with Miss Lake, but had been laughed at when he sought Coe's support. Coe's next-door neighbor and lover Doris Delafield (Helen Vinson) had been cheating on him with Eduardo Grassi (Jack La Rue). When Coe found out, he cancelled a contract to sell his collection of Chinese artworks to the Milan museum for which Grassi worked. Liang (James Lee), the cook, had worked long, hard, and illegally to help Coe amass his collection. He warned his employer against the proposed sale and was fired as a result. Even Coe's own brother Brisbane (Frank Conroy) despised Coe. Finally, Gamble (Arthur Hohl), the head servant, had concealed his criminal past. Brisbane Coe becomes Vance's prime suspect. His alibi of taking a train at the time of the murder is disproved. When Brisbane is found dead in a closet, Vance is both puzzled and enlightened. Among Brisbane's effects, Vance finds a book titled Unsolved Murders; a bookmarked page details a method of using string to lock a door through the keyhole without leaving a trace. Part of the mystery is solved. Later, an attempt is made on the life of Sir Thomas using the same dagger used to kill Coe. Finally, a Doberman Pinscher belonging to Miss Delafield is found seriously injured, apparently struck with a fireside poker. From these and other clues, Vance finally solves the crime. It turns out that two men sought to end Coe's life that night. The successful murderer struggled with Coe and stabbed him, leaving him for dead. Coe awakened soon after. Too dazed to recall the fight or realize that he was mortally wounded, he went upstairs to his bedroom and opened his window before dying. Brisbane entered the chamber; seeing his brother apparently asleep in his chair, he shot the corpse and arranged the scene to look like a suicide. Downstairs, he ran into the actual killer, who had seen through a window that Archer Coe was still alive and come back to finish the job. In the darkness, the killer mistook Brisbane for Archer and killed the wrong man. Delafield's dog then wandered in, attracted by the commotion, and attacked the murderer. While sure of the killer's identity, Vance has no proof. He therefore arranges for Sir Thomas and Wrede to quarrel over Hilda Lake. When Wrede instinctively reaches for the poker to strike his rival, the Doberman recognizes its attacker and leaps on him. Wrede confesses he became enraged when Coe refused to assist his courtship of Miss Lake, precipitating the stabbing.

Ralph Bellamy was reported to have been signed to perform in the film, but he does not appear in the film as released. Production The Kennel Murder Case was the first adaptation of one of S. S. Van Dine's Philo Vance novel to be filmed by Warner Bros. Early Vance films had been made by Paramount Pictures, and later ones would be made by Warners, Paramount and MGM. Vance would be played by Warren William, Paul Lukas, Edmund Lowe, and James Stephenson. Director Michael Curtiz covered the talkiness of the film, endemic to whodunnits of this sort, by using a mobile camera in some scenes, and kept up the pace of the film with dissolves and wipes.  Reception  Film historian William K. Everson, who pronounced the film a \\"masterpiece\\" in the August 1984 issue of Films in Review, considers The Kennel Murder Case to be one of the greatest screen adaptations of a Golden Age mystery novel; Everson ranks it with the 1946 film Green for Danger. The film made a profit of almost $400,000.Miller, Frank (ndg) \\"The Kennel Murder Case (1933)\\" TCM.com According to Warner Bros records the film earned $441,000 domestically and $241,000 internationally. Remake Warners remade The Kennel Murder Case in 1940 as Calling Philo Vance, with James Stephenson playing Vance.

The EJF was established in 2006 on the initiative of Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, who is President of the European Jewish Congress and EJF Chairman. Ariella Woitchik is EJF Secretary General. The Fund's governing body is Advisory Council, which consists of representatives from European Jewish communities. The EJF implements local, regional and pan-European projects initiated by both individual communities and the Fund itself. The EJF’s main goal is to strengthen Jewish identity and bringing Jewish communities together. Its activities develop national pride and reinforce Jewish pride within communities. The EJF highlights and celebrates Jewish individuals and their remarkable contributions to European and global society and culture. The Fund also implements large-scale programmes aimed at disseminating tolerance on the European continent, strengthening mutual respect among representatives of all nationalities and faiths, reinforcing Jews’ cultural pride and counteracting assimilation. The EJF actively fights xenophobia, antisemitism and racial discrimination and develops proposals and recommendations on reinforcing the fight against these negative phenomena of the modern world. It is also committed to promoting educational programmes that ensure the lessons and memory of the Holocaust live on. Projects The Fund’s activities fall into several categories: education and leadership; culture and heritage; community building; Shoah memory. One of the EJF’s founders, the World Holocaust Forum Foundation, holds together with the European Jewish Congress the “Let My People Live!” international forums. To date four of these forums have been held, the last two in cooperation with the President of the European Parliament: *January 2005 – The first forum, in Krakow, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. *September 2006 – The second forum, in Kiev, marked 65 years since the atrocity in Babi Yar. *January 2010 – The third forum, in Krakow, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau. *January 2015 – The fourth forum took place in Prague and Terezin, commemorating the 70th anniversary since the liberation of concentration and death camps. The EJF helps organise these high-level international gatherings to preserving historical memory and evidence, and encourage the international community to unite in the fight against hatred and xenophobia. Other EJC activities are: *Publicising the achievements of outstanding individuals of Jewish origin: in order to reduce the level of antisemitism, xenophobia and nationalism in Europe. The EJF supports the Museum of Avant-Garde Mastery, containing a collection of works by famous Russian artists of Jewish origin including Valentin Serov, Léon Bakst, Marc Chagall, El Lissitzky and Chaim Soutine. *Promoting nuclear non-proliferation and preventing a nuclear holocaust: The EJF supports the activities of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, which consists of prominent political and public figures, diplomats and nuclear experts. The EJF’s leadership believes that the Iranian nuclear programme is one of the major threats to global security today. *Providing a platform for reinforcing relations between European Jewish communities: Annual EJF Advisory Council meetings foster dialogue between Jewish communities, with open exchanges of experience that produce cooperative solutions to shared challenges. The Fund actively participated in the organisation of the European Week of Tolerance, held in large European cities on November 9–16, 2008. This series of events marked both the International Day for Tolerance and the 70th anniversary of die Kristallnacht. Within the framework of the European Week of Tolerance, prominent leaders, business people and scholars came together for a series of meetings. The European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe were presented with the draft European Framework Convention on Promoting Tolerance and Combating Intolerance and the Concept for a White Paper on Tolerance.

Origins of the name The house and surrounding structures were self- built by Cabot Abram Yerxa (1883–1965),Palm Springs Cemetery District, \\"Interments of Interest\\" an early 20th-century homesteader in the Coachella Valley.Yerxa was born on a Lakota Sioux reservation in the Dakota Territory. Before starting the Pueblo, he traveled to Alaska to sell cigars during the Nome Gold Rush, Cuba to develop real estate, and Mexico. His family owned an orange grove in Riverside, California, but lost the crop to freezing in 1913. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army. Later he worked as the postmaster of Sierra Madre, California. His parents were long established in New England and New Brunswick. (Brown 2011, pp. 11–12.) Yerxa also subdivided property to create the town of Desert Hot Springs. ( (here for Table of Contents)) The Palm Springs Unified School District Cabot Yerxa Elementary School in Desert Hot Springs is named in his honor.

Using pick and shovel to dig wells, Yerxa discovered two separate aquifers separated by the Mission Creek FaultMission Springs Water District: hot water maps (a branch of the San Andreas Fault) atop what would later be called \\"Miracle Hill.\\" The first aquifer was a natural hot spring with a temperature of 110 °F (43 °C) in the Desert Hot Springs Sub-Basin – describes the geologic sub-basins and which would later help give rise to the area's spas and resorts. The second, on the opposite side of the fault, was a cold aquifer of the Mission Springs Sub-Basin.Mission Springs Water District: sub-basins map This same aquifer provides fresh water to the city of Desert Hot Springs and has received awards for exceptional taste.Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting AwardsCity of Desert Hot Springs – Water After 24 years of construction, and fashioning it as a Hopi Indian pueblo in honor of the Indian people, Yerxa opened \\"Cabot's Old Indian Pueblo\\" in 1945. He operated it with his wife, Portia, until his death in 1965. Upon his death Portia returned to her native Texas and the structure was abandoned. Yerxa's friend Cole Eyraud protected the settlement after his death and after it had been abandoned and vandalized.Cole Eyraud was a Burbank businessman who knew Yerxa in the past. Upon discovering the abandoned Pueblo, he purchased the complex and established Landmark Conservators to preserve the landmark. (Landmark Conservators, California Secretary of State Entity Number: C0561941, Filed: 01/29/1969 ) (Minckler 1986, p. 23.) Eyraud and his family purchased the complex, restoring it and later donating it to the City of Desert Hot Springs. Cabot's Pueblo Museum official website Architecture The centerpiece of the complex is a large, Hopi-style pueblo, in the Pueblo Revival Style of architecture. The main building is a four-story, 5000 square foot (465 sq.m) structure with 35 rooms, 150 windows, 65 doors and 30 different roof levels. The pueblo and all the outbuildings on the site were built primarily from scrap wood and sheet metal all scavenged from the surrounding desert by Yerxa. It has a system of vents and shafts built into the walls to keep it cool in the summer.

Waokiye is the twenty-seventh sculpture in a series of 74 giant Native American heads, collectively known as the Trail of the Whispering Giants, carved during a twenty-one-year period by artist Peter Wolf Toth. The 43-foot sculpture was carved with the use of power tools from a section of a 45-ton (46 metric ton) giant sequoia log. The 750-year-old tree, which originally stood in Sequoia National Park, had been felled by lightning in the mid-1950s. All but the feather in Waokiye's headband was carved from the log. The feather was carved from an incense cedar from the nearby mountain community of Idyllwild. The statue was unveiled on May 20, 1978; it was repaired and rededicated by Toth on February 21, 2009. At present, it is the only one of the sculptures left in California.Listing of the museum's Waokiye sculpture at Dcschumaker.com Operations Owners The City of Desert Hot Springs owns the museum and it is operated by the Cabot's Museum Foundation, a non-profit corporation.California Secretary of State Entity search, Entity Number C2371784, filed 12/07/2001 Cabot's Museum Foundation is a member of the American Alliance of Museums.

Sumerian harvester's sickle, 3000 BC, made from baked clay Archeological evidence suggests that the first civilizations arose in Sumer, in southern Mesopotamia (now Iraq) and Egypt, both dating from around 3000 BCE. By 1000 BCE, civilizations were also established in India, China, Mexico, Peru and in parts of Europe.Kramer, S. (1988). History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History. University of Pennsylvania Press; 3rd edition (April 1988), pp. 52–55..Wright, R., p. 42. Sumer illustrates issues central to the sustainability of human civilization.Wright, R., pp. 86–116 Sumerian cities practiced intensive, year- round agriculture from BCE. The surplus of storable food created by this economy allowed the population to settle in one place instead of migrating in search of wild foods and grazing land. It also allowed for a much greater population density. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia required many labourers to build and maintain its irrigation system. This, in turn, led to political hierarchy, bureaucracy, and religious sanction, along with standing armies to protect the emergent civilization. Intensified agriculture allowed for population increase, but also led to deforestation in upstream areas with resultant flooding and over-irrigation, which raised soil salinity. While there was a shift from the cultivation of wheat to the more salt- tolerant barley, yields still diminished. Eventually, decreasing agricultural production and other factors led to the decline of the civilization. From 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population was reduced by nearly sixty percent. Civilizations similarly thought to have eventually fallen because of poor management of resources include the Mayans, Anasazi and Easter Islanders, among many others.Diamond, J. (2005).

Emergence of industrial societies A Watt steam engine, the steam engine fuelled primarily by coal that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world Technological advances over several millennia gave humans increasing control over the environment. But it was the Western industrial revolution of the 18th to 19th centuries that tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease.Hilgenkamp, K.

Such conditions led to a human population explosion and unprecedented industrial, technological and scientific growth that has continued to this day, marking the commencement of a period of global human influence known as the Anthropocene. From 1650 to 1850 the global population doubled from around 500 million to 1 billion people.Goudie A. (2005). The Human Impact on the Natural Environment. 6th ed. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing. . Concerns about the environmental and social impacts of industry were expressed by some Enlightenment political economists and through the Romantic movement of the 1800s.

However, in the 1930s economists began developing models of non-renewable resource management (see Hotelling's rule) and the sustainability of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable resources (Hartwick's rule). Ecology had now gained general acceptance as a scientific discipline, and many concepts vital to sustainability were being explored. These included: the interconnectedness of all living systems in a single living planetary system, the biosphere; the importance of natural cycles (of water, nutrients and other chemicals, materials, waste); and the passage of energy through trophic levels of living systems.Worster, D (1994) \\"Nature's economy: a history of ecological ideas\\".

The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on a nonrenewable resource; President Carter in his State of the Union Address called on Americans to \\"Conserve energy.

In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission), in its report Our Common Future suggested that development was acceptable, but it must be sustainable development that would meet the needs of the poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity's demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s.Southface Energy and Environmental Resource Center.

The landscape is characterised by escarpments. It is variously referred to in the German literature as the: * ' (Southwest German Scarplands) * ' (Southwest German Scarp Landscape) * ' (Swabian-Franconian Scarpland(scape)) * ' (South German Scarpland(scape))  Location and short description  The South German Scarplands run (from north(-northeast) to south(-southwest)) more or less between the southern Rhön, the Spessart, the Odenwald and the Black Forest in the west, the Franconian Jura in the east, the Swabian Jura to the southeast and the northeastern foothills of the Jura to the south. The wooded west and northwest-facing scarps drop sharply towards the Rhine Rift Valley and the Rhine-Main Plain, whilst the dip slopes fall comparatively gradually towards the (north-)east into the depressions beyond which lie the Thuringian Forest, Thuringian Highland, Franconian Forest, Fichtelgebirge, Upper Palatine Forest and Bavarian Forest. Similarly the Swabian and Franconian Jura descend quite gently towards the south(east) to the Danube valley, whilst the Swabian Jura, for example, drop very steeply to the north(-northwest) from the so-called Albtrauf - the top of the main scarp.Dickinson (1964), p 567.  Anticlinal scarplands between Paris and the Bohemian Forest  The South German Scarplands are part of a scarp landscape that stretches from the Bohemian Forest to the Paris Basin. This anticlinal terrain is a result of the tectonic bulging of the earth's surface between Paris and the Bohemian Forest. Following the sinking of the Upper Rhine Rift Valley in the area of maximum uplift and flexure, scarplands were formed to the east and west of the rift, their layers of rock all dipping away from the Upper Rhine. These regions are the known in the west as the North French Scarplands (in northern France and the Palatinate) and in the east as the South German Scarplands (in Baden- Württemberg and northern Bavaria). These two great areas of scarpland are linked in the south by the scarps of the Tafeljura on the High Rhine, as well as those in the region of Basle, the Ajoie and in the rest of the Belfort Gap. In the area of the Faltenjura, around the southern perimeter of the Upper Rhine Rift in the Sundgau (Pfirter Jura), the two scarplands (unfolded layers) are separated from one another by a short distance. The rock layers involved were formed in the Triassic und Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic era. The sedimentary beds were gently tilted and exposed to the surface and erosion and weathering occurred differentially based on their composition. The less resistant rocks eroded faster, retreating until the point they were overlain by more resistant rock resulting in the cuestas characteristic of scarplands.  Geographical formation  The present scarp landscape was formed during the Mesozoic era. About 350 million years ago a large basin emerged which was surrounded by mountain ranges and ridges. Prior to that red sandstone had accumulated in the numerous depressions, the erosion products from the Variscan mountains. In the Triassic and Jurassic periods the region sometimes lay above sea level and sometimes below it, so that alternate beds of continental and marine deposition were laid down. The typical, present-day, escarpments have emerged since the Neogene geological period, after the Upper Rhine Rift Valley was formed as a result of plate tectonic processes about 30 million years ago. The regions either side of the rift valley were violently uplifted, producing the Black Forest on the German side and the Vosges on the French side. This uplifting had the consequence that in the entire South German scarpland region the strata no longer lay horizontally, but were tilted away from the Rhine rift descending from west to east. As a result of the lifting and tilting of these sedimentary layers, weathering set in, which the more resistant layers of rock withstood for longer than the softer layers. For example, the clays were relatively easily eroded and formed gentler gradients, whilst the harder sandstones or limestones were less susceptible to weathering and formed the steeper scarps. The resulting geological structures brought the various geological strata to the earth's surface where they could be easily observed and assessed. The most important strata are named after the geological periods of the Mesozoic era. These are, in order of their occurrence from west to east: Bunter sandstone, Muschelkalk, Keuper, Black Jura, Brown Jura and White Jura. Bunter sandstone occurs predominantly in the Northern Black Forest and has ensured the continued existence of large forested areas, because of the low productivity of its soils. Muschelkalk underlies the fertile Gäu landscapes of the Baar as far as Lower Franconia. The Keuper, with its relatively poor soils again, lends its name to the scarplands of the Keuper-Lias Uplands. The most prominent Jurassic scarps - notably the Swabian and Franconian Jura – are formed by the White Jura and, in the southwest, also the Brown Jura.  Human use and economic importance  The Upper Rhine Rift Valley and the Mainz Basin have relatively fertile arable land as a result of ice age deposits of loess. In the uplands, however, the soils only have low to medium productivity. In places where limestone reaches the surface, karstification has resulted in the formation of caves which drain almost all of the precipitation. As a result, these upland areas have very little surface water. This is the case to some extent with the Swabian and the Franconian Jura, which run north of the upper course of the Danube. Vineyards are concentrated in the lower regions of the scarplands, whilst forestry plays an important role in the higher mountain areas.

It was built in the Ponsonby Depot and commissioned on 1 August 1913. 304 was designed to carry rails for reconstruction and construction of the Auckland Tramway network and was perhaps one of the most unique trams in service in New Zealand. During peace celebrations following World War One, in 1919, No. 304 carried a brass band up and down Queen Street. 10 December 1956 was Number 304's last journey into Central Auckland where it removed the remains of a damaged safety zone. It was the last tram to move under power on the original tram system in 1957, towing tram 248 now at Museum of Transport and Technology. Number 304's Blackwell trolley standard which the trolley pole's were attached to were removed in 1957. They were later sent to the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland where they were fitted to two trams when undergoing restoration (numbers 44 & 11). No. 304's crane controller is preserved at the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. No. 304 in the early 1900s Number 304 entered service in 1913. The New Zealand Herald stated \\"she is a travelling crane which will easily accommodate nine lengths of rail. It would take three carts to handle such a load\\". In 1917, a Ponsonby tram ran off the lines on the corner of Queen and Trafalgar Streets. No. 304 was sent to assist. Primary use No.304 was especially constructed for the use of moving full length tram track. Imported tram track was shipped from the United Kingdom and taken to a stub track on Quay Street around the eastern corner from Queen Street where it was craned aboard 304, which had especially dished front aprons so over-length rails could be carried. The rails would then be taken to the Permanent Way Department of the Auckland Electric Tramway Company Limited, later the Auckland City Corporation Tramways and finally Auckland Transport Board, where the rail was stored and bent prior to being relocated by 304 to wherever new rail was being laid or repairs or track replacement was required. Fate On 5 July 1957, No. 304 was withdrawn from service after towing dismantled old Auckland tram bodies around the Royal Oak Workshops that were left after the closure of the Auckland tramways in December 1956. Once 304 had towed the last tram to the gallows (used to raise old tram bodies to enable transport to their new homes) it was sent back to the truckshop. Graham Stewart (author of many New Zealand tram and history books) had written in chalk on the front aprons \\"THE END\\". 304 was sold to a farmer. 304 left the Royal Oak Workshops on 5 September 1957 by Elliot (Te Kopuru Transport) Detailed Information Number 304 had Brush model D trucks, canopies over both motorman's cabins with glass fronts, Self Lapping Motorman brake valves for ease of use by Workshop crews.

Then trumpets and shawms blew, and the court went into the Abbey for mass, during which James V read the letters with Gavin Dunbar.

Magnus was in Scotland in August and September 1525. He wrote that when James V received a gift of a silver dagger from the Duke of Albany he immediately gave it away to a person standing nearby, an apparent insult to the Duke. French ambassadors were kept waiting at Leith for three or four days rather than having a solemn reception. Magnus claimed that James moved to Dalkeith Palace to avoid the French ambassador, Pierre François de Lagarde, sieur de Saignes, President of Toulouse. The news was supposed to indicate that Scotland was moving away from French influences and the 1517 Treaty of Rouen for the king's marriage to a French princess.

Early life and education Toon was born to Thomas Arthur and Hilda Toon in Yorkshire, England, in 1939. His younger siblings were Paul, David and Christine. He attended and graduated from the following schools and colleges: *Hemsworth Grammar School, near Wakefield, Yorkshire *Cliff College, near Sheffield *King's College London (Bachelor of Divinity with upper second-class honours) *University of Liverpool *Christ Church, Oxford (DPhil) Career After an earlier career as a college lecturer in religious studies, Toon was ordained deacon in 1973 and priest in 1974 in the Diocese of Liverpool (Church of England). He served a short title curacy in Skelmersdale (just over a year, compared with the usual requirement of three years),See Toon's entry at Crockford Clerical Directory. before taking a post in Oxford as Librarian of Latimer House, the headquarters and library of a conservative evangelical pressure group (subsequently the Latimer Trust, without property, but maintaining its library at Oak Hill Theological College, London) during which time he also served as curate of St Ebbe's, a central Oxford evangelical parish church. In 1976 he became a tutor at Oak Hill Theological College in London, training ordinands, and then from 1982 Director of Post-Ordination Training in the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich in East Anglia. He returned briefly to parish ministry (Staindrop, County Durham) before moving to the United States of America in 1991. In the last decade of his working life, he served as President and CEO of the Prayer Book Society of the USA, and his life and work were centred in America, although he did return briefly to England, and was for four years the priest-in-charge of the villages of Biddulph Moor and Brown Edge in Staffordshire. Toon wrote over 25 books, together with numerous booklets, essays and articles. He also engaged in internet authorship and discussion, contributing to these topical online discussions until his death.Bishops, false prophets, false priests by Peter Toon, April 2009 Style and beliefs Toon's work repeatedly stressed the importance of the \\"Historic Formularies\\" of the Anglican tradition, defined in the Preface to the Declaration of Assent as \\"the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons\\". His work was marked by clarity of presentation and strength of persuasion, attracting praise from supporters and critical attention from antagonists. He often wrote and spoke about the controversies in the Anglican Communion concerning issues of liturgical reform and the ordination of women, on both of which issues he took a strongly conservative line. With the widespread adoption of the new liturgies in the Church of England (Alternative Service Book 1980, and then Common Worship 2000) and similar liturgical resources in other provinces (notably the 1979 revised Book of Common Prayer of the Episcopal Church of the United States of America), Toon became a notable spokesman and theological advocate for the strong minority lobby favouring traditionalist views, and the retention of the seventeenth-century liturgies of the (original) Book of Common Prayer.Episcopal Innovations 1960–2004 by Dr. Peter Toon . Although Toon is remembered, particularly in later life, for his association with these controversies, and with the Continuing Anglican movement which arose, particularly in America, out of opposition to reforms, he was also a gifted theologian and biblical commentator, whose work (particularly in earlier life) was of a general nature, not associated with controversy, and widely employed by students of biblical analysis. Personal life He was married to Vita for forty-seven years. Vita graduated from London and Oxford universities. They had one daughter, Deborah, who is married to a naval officer and lives in California. Deborah graduated from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, and the University of Texas at Austin. Toon died on 25 April 2009, in San Diego, California. The cause of death was amyloidosis, a rare auto-immune disease, which he had been battling for some months. There was a private family funeral in California followed by a public memorial service organised by the Prayer Book Society of the USA at All Saints' Church, Wynnewood, Pennsylvania on 24 July 2009.

It had offices in London and Brighton and listed approximately a million properties uploaded by estate agents for a monthly fee. In April 2012 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) agreed a merger between findaproperty.com and Zoopla. Since the merger the findaproperty.com brand was deprecated and the findaproperty.com domain now points to the Zoopla website. The FindaProperty.com logo The portal was started in 1997 by businessman and entrepreneur Andrew Pendery who had experience of the US property market and saw a gap in the UK one for an online listings portal. He began the site in his London bedroom and with the help of salesman Ferenc Schustek, achieved initial growth. He then moved the business to Brighton at offices in West Street and later, Dyke Road. The site's first listings were in London and Surrey, the UK's busiest property markets and 'hot-spots' for high house prices.  History  While the business was in Brighton Pendery, with editor Mike O'Flynn and information technology specialist Simon D'Urso, expanded the business significantly, enough to attract venture capital money. In early 2004 businessmen Neil Anderson along with Simon D'Urso bought Pendery out for £2.8 million, financed by Barclays Ventures, who put David Garrett - who later went on to work for Figleaves.com - into the business to oversee its investment. In November 2004 the site was sold to Associated Newspapers, the publisher of The Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday and Metro for £8 million. In 2008 parent group the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) set up The Digital Property Group (through DMGT subsidiary A&N; Media) to which it added Primelocation.com in 2006 for £48 million and Globrix in 2009 for £7 million. FindaProperty.com increased the number of properties it lists significantly since being sold to DMGT from some 75,000 in early 2004 to nearly 800,000 in November 2010. Functionality additions to the site outside its property search engine for sales, rental, auction and investment properties included being the launch partner for Google Street View UK (March 2009) and the first property website in the UK to integrate Street View into property details and area information pages. An iPhone App with augmented reality was created with the launch of a TV advertising campaign starring actor Ross Green, who plays a variety of characters rapping about property. In late 2011 a proposed merger between FindaProperty.com's parent company the Digital Property Group and rival Zoopla.com was announced, subject to approval from the relevant business competition authorities in the UK. This merger was later agreed by the OFT.

Plot In the waters off South America, the Soviets torpedo the tramp steamer and banana boat SS Banos and murder the survivors with the cooperation of the ship's radioman, Clegg who escapes with his life and a promise of $5000. The Soviets have mocked up their own ship as the SS Banos that contains an atomic device with the goal of sailing the Banos to the locks of the Panama Canal where they will detonate their ship on an atomic suicide mission. To avoid suspicion the new crew of the mocked up Banos takes the contingent of passengers scheduled to sail on the original Banos. One last minute addition is American expatriate Sam Wilton who has overstayed his welcome as a plantation overseer by making love to the plantation owner's wife. As a result, Sam and his lover's husband are both wounded in a gunfight. Sam needs to escape to the United States without his passport that is still at the plantation. At the Los Rios Hotel in the port city of San Brejo that is also Sam's watering hole, Sam asks his friend Manuel the owner to get him a passport in a false name to escape the vengeance of the plantation owner and the sympathetic local authorities. As Sam waits and drinks he observes the passengers of the SS Banos in the hotel; an older American couple Fred and Kate Dilts, American Everett Crofton, the mysterious Mr Kroll, and two Germans, Dr Yeager and his daughter Elsa. The new Captain of the Banos, \\"Captain Scarface\\" sends Clegg to meet Kroll at the Los Rios Hotel for his just reward. When the passengers are taken to the Banos, Kroll, Clegg and Sam remind behind at the hotel. In the interest of economy and security Kroll attempts to murder Clegg, but Clegg kills Kroll first. Escaping with the money, Clegg shoots at Manuel and Sam, who responds by shooting Clegg. Never wasting an opportunity, Sam splits the $5000 with Manuel and modifies the late Mr Kroll's passport with own photograph, and takes Kroll's boarding pass to the Banos. Boarding the ship, Sam as Kroll delays meeting Captain Scarface in order to interview Elsa to find out the lay of the land. He pieces together that Dr. Yeager is a German atomic scientist allowed to escape from the Soviet Union in order to work the atomic device in exchange for the safety of his daughter and Kroll was a Soviet agent assigned to bring in the Yeagars and kill Clegg.

Although a successful \\"stickup artist\\" during the 1920s and early 1930s, he is best remembered for his involvement in the hoax kidnapping of Chicago mobster Jake \\"The Barber\\" Factor, a crime for which he and Roger Touhy were eventually proven innocent after nearly 20 years in prison. Biography Early life and criminal career Basil Hugh Banghart was born in Berville, Michigan in 1901. He dropped out of college after one year to become a professional car thief, stealing over one hundred cars in the Detroit area before his arrest in 1926. It was around this time that Banghart acquired his criminal nickname \\"The Owl\\" because of his abnormally large eyes. Banghart escaped from Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary months into his sentence. Escaping from a window washing detail, he leapt 25 feet from a window he was washing and over the prison's wall escaping through the marsh on the other side. He got as far as Montana but was recaptured and returned to prison. He made a second escape a year later, but was caught trying to steal a car in Pittsburgh in October 1928. This time, Banghart was escorted back to prison by US Marshals. He was taken to a federal building and, left alone in an office for a few minutes, Banghart used a phone to call local police claiming he was a federal agent who had been assaulted and overpowered by his prisoner, Basil Banghart. He continued claiming that \\"Banghart\\" had escaped after handcuffing him and described the US Marshal that was escorting him noting that he was \\"a dangerous, armed felon and a police impostor\\". When police arrived moments later, they took the escort into custody while Banghart escaped in the confusion. Banghart was arrested once more in February 1930, was returned to Leavenworth, but quickly escaped again. He was arrested in Detroit for armed robbery in January 1932 and held in the South Bend Indiana jail but escaped by throwing pepper in a guard's face then using a machine gun to shoot his way out. Banghart and the Roger Touhy Gang Banghart headed south and eventually made his way to Chicago where he joined up with Roger Touhy's organization. Touhy, a veteran bootlegger from the days of Prohibition, was then in the midst of a fierce rivalry with Frank Nitti over labor racketeering. Banghart became a major asset to Touhy during this time, and no doubt an active participant in Touhy's war with the Chicago Outfit, however there is only one recorded incident in which Banghart was specifically involved. On January 31, 1933, Jimmy O'Brien was killed by Nitti's gunmen in front of the Garage Nightclub. O'Brien was one of Touhy's union men and one of the latest victims of the Touhy-Nitti feud. A week later, a man identified as Banghart returned to the nightclub where he stepped out of a sedan and tossed a bomb through the front doors of the club. No one was injured but the club itself was heavily damaged. Involvement with the Factor kidnapping When the Chicago Outfit staged the kidnapping of one of their own members, Jake \\"The Barber\\" Factor, in July 1933, it was expected to postpone his extradition to stand trial for fraud in Great Britain as well as rid themselves of rival bootlegger Roger Touhy on whom the kidnapping would be blamed.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 12-13) The members of the British consulate refused to believe the story and won a judgment for Factor's extradition from the U.S. Supreme Court. In desperation, Factor and the Chicago mob sought to make the kidnapping more legitimate by arranging a pickup with the supposed kidnappers. Banghart and his partner Charles \\"Ice Wagon\\" Connors were brought into the plan at this point. Hired to be the \\"bagmen\\", they were told all they needed was to pick up the money, make it \\"look real\\", and they could keep the ransom money. On August 15, the two showed up at the scheduled drop on Manheim Road just outside the Chicago city limits. As soon as they arrived, they found 300 Chicago police officers and FBI agents waiting for them. To make matters worse, inside the ransom package was only $500. In spite of the obvious double-cross, Banghart and Connors surprised everyone by escaping after a wild shootout. Capture, trial and imprisonment Despite being set up, Banghart and Connors did not seek revenge against the Chicago Outfit and instead went on the run. On November 15, 1933, they teamed with Ike Costner and Ludwig \\"Dutch\\" Schmidt to hijack a U.S. mail truck of $105,000 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Banghart and Costner were eventually captured by the time the second trial for Factor's kidnapping was held on February 13, 1934. Facing long prison sentences for the Charlotte mail truck robbery, both men agreed to testify for the prosecution. Although Costner had not been involved in the ransom pickup, when Connors was found murdered on March 14, he took Connors' place and falsely stated that he and Banghart had been hired for the Factor kidnapping by Roger Touhy. When Banghart took the stand, however, he denied these claims and attempted to explain that the kidnapping was staged. Banghart's testimony was largely ignored and he along with Touhy and two others were convicted and received 99-year sentences. Escape with Touhy After years of unsuccessful appeals, Banghart and Touhy escaped Joliet with Edward Derlack, Martlick Nelson, William Stewart, St. Clair McInerney and James O'Connor on October 9, 1942. The FBI immediately joined the manhunt justifying its involvement charging that the convicts had violated the federal draft law by not informing Selective Service of their change of address. Soon after their escape, Banghart and Touhy were suspected of taking part in a robbery at Melrose Park, Illinois on December 19 which netted $20,000 although no charges were brought against them. McInerney and O'Connor were killed in a gun battle with federal agents less than two weeks after their escape and the rest were captured at a nearby address on December 29, 1942. J. Edgar Hoover observed the raid and took part in what would be his last \\"personal arrest\\". Release and later years The convicts were given even longer jail sentences for their escape, and on January 2, 1943, Banghart was returned to Stateville where he was placed in solitary confinement. He was then transferred, with an escort of 18 federal marshals, to Alcatraz. He spent the rest of his time in the prison kitchen working with former public enemy Alvin Karpis in the bakery. Jokingly referred to by inmates as the \\"Karpis Kitchen Crew\\", Banghart and Karpis allegedly learned to produce wine and other alcoholic beverages from cherry pie juices and other material in the kitchen. \\"The challenge was to avoid becoming an alcoholic\\" Karpis later wrote in his memoirs. In 1954, a federal judge declared the Factor kidnapping a fraud and that Banghart and Touhy had most likely been wrongly convicted involving the Chicago Outfit and corrupt Chicago officials. Banghart was transferred back to Stateville in 1959 and eventually his kidnapping conviction was overturned and the mail robbery charges were dropped for time served. He was released the following year where, at age 60, he was reunited with his longtime girlfriend Mae Blacock. He'd also received a small inheritance from his aunt 15 years before. Banghart retired to a small island in Puget Sound.

Bentz spent much of his youth in juvenile reformatories for burglary and later began safe-cracking and armed robbery by his early 20s. According to crime historian William Helmer, Bentz participated in over 150 robberies across the U.S. \\"without ever being named or indicted\\"; however, Helmer has never provided verifiable evidence for his claims. Bentz became extremely successful as a bank robber and lived an extravagant lifestyle collecting rare books and coins. He was also known as a meticulous planner and well known for charting escape routes. He and Harvey Bailey were the prime suspects in the infamous bank robbery of $2,870,000 in Lincoln, Nebraska on September 17, 1930, although neither was ever charged for that robbery. During 1932, he began teaming with Albert Bates and George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, robbing a bank in Ponder, Texas on July 31 and another in Colfax, Washington on September 21, taking $70,000 in cash and bonds. The robberies were wrongly attributed to Bonnie and Clyde and Pretty Boy Floyd, respectively. Eight days after the Colfax robbery, Bentz and several unidentified accomplices raided another bank in Holland, Michigan. Bentz went into semi-retirement after that job and was living in Long Beach, Indiana, when he was approached in 1933 by George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson to join him and his gang in planning the robbery of a bank in Grand Haven, Michigan. Bentz agreed, and the getaway driver fled on the day of the robbery, stranding Bentz, Nelson and the others. One of the robbers, Eddie Doyle, was arrested; however, the rest of the robbers managed to escape in a second waiting car with $30,000. John Dillinger was widely speculated to have been one of the participants; however, historical evidence indicates he was involved in bank heists on his own in Indiana and Ohio at the time of the robbery. In spite of the federal government placing most bank robberies under federal jurisdiction, which consequently would involve the FBI's hunting down many Depression-era outlaws, Bentz remained a fugitive. On July 4, 1934, he and several unidentified accomplices robbed a bank in Danville, Vermont but escaped with only $8,500. It is unclear if that was the last robbery Bentz participated in, but he was not identified in any other hold-ups after the Danville robbery. Bentz was eventually tracked down to an address in Brooklyn, New York and arrested by federal agents on March 13, 1936, finding him hiding in a dumbwaiter. Taken into custody, he refused to name his accomplices in the Danville robbery and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. At the time of his sentencing, Bentz asked to be sent to Alcatraz, supposedly stating to the judge that \\"all my friends are there\\". He was eventually paroled from Alcatraz in 1948 and returned to his hometown in Tacoma where he died of a heart attack on October 31, 1979.

New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 39–40) Biography Early life and criminal career Born in Oklahoma in 1904, Brady was first arrested in Kansas for larceny at age 15. He was sent to the State Industrial Reformatory in Hutchinson for five years. Brady continued his criminal career, serving time for forgery, petty theft and other minor offences,Pryor, Alton.

(pg. 123–124) and was imprisoned in Oklahoma for forgery in 1922 and armed robbery in 1925. Upon his release in 1931, Brady joined Clarence \\"Buck\\" Adams in the robbery of $5,300 from a bank in Texhoma, Oklahoma on September 15, 1931. Brady and his partner were captured by Sheriff O.L. Clark eleven days later at Carlsbad Cavern in New Mexico and immediately transferred to the county lockup in Amarillo, Texas. Brady attempted to escape during this time and sustained a serious head wound, the bullet very narrowly missing his brain, and was taken to Epworth Hospital in Liberal, Kansas where he underwent surgery. He would have to wear glasses for the rest of his life and could not completely close his left eyelid. The following month, by the time Brady had recovered, he was transferred to the state prison in McAlester, Oklahoma. Escape and Midwest crime spree Brady escaped from McAlester on July 23, 1932, and went on to embark on a five-month crime spree in at least five states. He stopped briefly in Ada, Oklahoma to visit his brother, who ran a local real estate brokerage, and while there robbed the same bank he had held up prior to his arrest the previous year. He then headed east raiding another bank in El Dorado Springs, Missouri and, on October 1, he stole a new car from a dealership in Liberal, Kansas. The next day, with Frank Philpot, he raided a bank in Springer, New Mexico. He was finally captured on December 20 after being spotted by police in Des Moines, Iowa. At the time of his arrest, he was found with a .38 revolver and a police badge stolen from an Oklahoma sheriff's deputy. Although wanted in four other states, he was tried in Kansas and sentenced to life imprisonment in Lansing.Wallis, Michael. Pretty Boy: The Life and Times of Charles Arthur Floyd.

Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2008. (pg. 71–72) On July 3, they robbed a bank in Clinton, Oklahoma for $11,000 and hit another in Kingfisher, Oklahoma on August 9. Two days after their latest robbery, he and the rest of the Bailey-Underhill gang met near Shawnee, Oklahoma to plan a bank heist in Brainerd, Minnesota. The following day, Bailey was arrested by federal agents during a raid on a ranch owned by George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly. With Bailey in custody, the Brainerd job was abandoned. Brady was also a suspect in the Kansas City Massacre. One of the three surviving federal agents, Reed Vetterli, wrote that he was \\"convinced\\" Brady was one of the gunmen. A little over a year later, however, Vetterli and the other agents agreed it was Pretty Boy Floyd.Wellman, Paul Iselin. A Dynasty of Western Outlaws. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986. (pg. 334) King, Jeffrey. The Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floyd. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1999. (pg. 126, 134) After Underhill headed off on his own, he and Clark decided to lie low for a while and took their \\"gun molls\\" to Arizona. Two months later, they returned in Oklahoma and hit a bank in Frederick for $5,000 on October 6. The outlaws escaped with $5,000 but missed nearly $80,000 in the bank vault and the teller cages in their rush to make their getaway. The robbery soon turned from bad to worse when they were forced to take three hostages, switch to a second getaway car in Indiahoma and race across Texas in an attempt to reach New Mexico. When police found their first car, they discovered a map marking their escape route and were able to phone ahead to authorities in New Mexico. Brady and Clark were eventually caught in Tucumcari, Oklahoma authorities waiving the bank robbery charges, and both were returned to Lansing. Brady had been shot by police during this time and Vetterli, who visited him while recovering in hospital, failed to identify him from Union Station. Death He and Clark were put in solitary confinement upon their return to Lansing. They gradually regained their prison privileges over a three-month period and, on January 19, 1934, Brady took part in yet another major prison break escaping with Clark and five others while on kitchen work detail. Once on the outside, he and Clark split up to go off on his own while his former partner joined fellow escapee Frank Delmar in a near- seven-month crime spree. Brady lasted only three more days on the run when authorities finally caught up with him. Trapped on a farm near Paola, Kansas, he attempted to engage in a shootout with Undersheriff Harvey Ray Lininger and Deputy Ed Schlotman but when his shotgun misfired, the officers opened fire and killed him. His death brought considerable attention to the area and reportedly around 2,500 people came to view his body in the local mortuary before it was sent to Oklahoma for burial.

It is located approximately southeast of the Town of Whitecourt within Woodlands County. The crater was found by Sonny Stevens, a resident of Whitecourt, on July 3, 2007. Stevens was hunting in the area, and later found the first fragments of the meteorite while metal detecting on the crater rim. The meteoritic nature of the fragments, and thus the authenticity of the crater, was confirmed by Dr. Chris Herd, professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta. The area has been placed within a 200-metre by 200-metre protected zone, within which collecting is prohibited and subject to a $50,000 fine or one year in jail. However, the vast majority of fragments have been found on Crown land beyond the protected area. The crater is approximately in diameter and deep. Its age is estimated to be between 1,080 and 1,130 years since the buried fragments of the impacting meteorite are all found above a layer of carbon from a forest fire dating around 1,100 years ago. More than 3,000 pieces of the impacting meteorite have been found (as of 2012). The pieces are shrapnel, mostly between a few grams and 500 grams in mass, with sharp edges and mechanically deformed from the impact, but showing no sign of impact melt. About one-half dozen individual meteorites have also been found with the largest weighing 31 kilograms. The meteorite fragments are irons of type IIIAB.

He is best known as the \\"good natured\\" member of the John Dillinger gang and participated in armed holdups with them in a three-month crime spree across the Midwestern United States from October 1933 until his capture in January 1934. Biography Early life and career A native of Oaktown, Knox County, Indiana, Russell Clark's criminal career began shortly after his dishonorable discharge from the United States Marines in 1919. He was a partner of Ralston \\"Blackie\\" Linton during the early 1920s and together robbed a series of \\"illicit roadhouses\\". In 1926, Clark was a suspect in the kidnapping of two West Terre Haute bootleggers and the murder of Joe Popolardo in Danville, Illinois. That same year, both Jack Morrison and Clark confessed to robbing the Bellevue Club in Evansville, Indiana on August 26 but the owner, Charles \\"Cotton\\" Jones, refused to press charges and the case was dropped. The following year, Clark went on a crime spree with Frank Badgley and Charles Hovious in northeast Indiana and robbed several banks. Clark was finally caught after his first robbery, from either Huntertown or Fort Wayne, Indiana, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment on December 11 or 12, 1927.McCormick, Mike. Terre Haute: Queen City of the Wabash. Chicago: Arcadia Publishing, 2005. (pg. 125) He spent his term at the state penitentiary in Michigan City and, while there, learned from veteran stick up artists. Clark's bitterness and rebellious attitude led to disciplinary problems with prison authorities. He made three unsuccessful escape attempts and was one of the ringleaders of an inmate strike in 1929. Clark was a popular jokester among inmates and was part of a \\"clique\\" which included Harry Pierpont, Charles Makley, John \\"Red\\" Hamilton, Homer Van Meter and John Dillinger.Toland, John.

On September 26, 1933, Clark and nine other convicts used the guns to help in a mass escape from the penitentiary. Along with Pierpont, Makley and Hamilton, the other escapees included James \\"Oklahoma Jack\\" Clark, Walter Dietrich, Ed Shouse, Joseph Fox, James Jenkins and Joseph Burns.Breuer, William B. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. (pg. 131-139, 153-156, 162) Nickel, Steven and William J. Helmer. Baby Face Nelson: Portrait of a Public Enemy. Nashville, Tennessee: Cumberland House Publishing, 2002. (pg. 132, 146-150, 170) Dillinger had been arrested in Dayton, Ohio four days prior to the prison break and Clark and the others quickly began planning to free him from custody. Stealing $14,000 from a bank in St. Mary's on October 3, 1933, they broke Dillinger out of prison in Lima, Ohio nine days later. Sheriff Jess Sarber was killed by Pierpont during the escape. Clark and the rest of the gang began raiding police stations in Auburn and Peru, Indiana stocking up on weapons, ammunition and bulletproof vests in preparation for a violent three-month crime spree across the Midwest. Time with the John Dillinger gang Clark was absent from the gang's first robbery in Greencastle, Indiana on October 23, missing out on his share of the $18,428 in cash and $56,300 in negotiable bonds, but was with them the following month when the gang robbed $27,789 from a bank in Racine, Wisconsin. The gang were forced to use four hostages as human shields in order to make their getaway. On December 13, 1933, Clark also took part in the robbery of a Chicago bank by chiseling through the walls and into the vault where they emptied 96 safety deposit boxes. The official report lists the theft of only $8,700 in cash however authorities estimated the gang may have gotten away with unreported cash and jewelry valued as high as $50,000. Following the Chicago bank heist, the state of Illinois published a list of public enemies. Of the 21 names listed, Clark was ranked fifth behind Dillinger, Pierpont, Hamilton and Makley respectively. The gang decided to hide out in Florida during the Christmas holidays and, by New Year's Day, regrouped in Tucson, Arizona to plan their next move. Clark and his girlfriend Opal Long were the first to arrive on January 10 and the rest following behind over the next week and a half. On January 22, 1934, less than a day after their reunion, a fire broke out in their hotel. A local firefighter, apparently an avid fan of detective pulp magazines, recognized both Clark and Makley.Lowe, Sam. Arizona Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff. Guilford, Connecticut: Globe Pequot, 2007. (pg. 172) The authorities were informed and the hotel was raided three days later. Clark was the first to be arrested and was reportedly pistol-whipped into unconsciousness when resisting arrest and going for a weapon. Dillinger, Pierpont and Makley were also arrested in the raid. Dillinger was extradited to Indiana to stand trial for the murder of an East Chicago police officer while Clark and the others were returned to Michigan City. Transferred to Lima, they were tried for the murder of Sheriff Sarber. Trial, conviction and imprisonment The trial began on February 14, 1934, and both Pierpont and Makley were sentenced to death the following month. Clark expected the same sentence and expressed disinterest in his own trial. He was often seen yawning loudly and sleeping in court. His lawyer Louis Piquett, a known underworld lawyer in Chicago, was able to persuade the jury to grant leniency in Clark's case, especially as the triggerman was already sentenced to death, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on March 24. The three men still held out hope that they would be liberated once more by Dillinger. When Dillinger was gunned down by federal agents in Chicago four months later, they decided to break out themselves. On September 22, 1934, a little more than a year after their last escape, Pierpont and Makley surprised their guards using pistols made from soap cakes (blackened with shoe polish) and escaped from their cells. They then moved on to free Clark and six other inmates but were stopped when they reached a set of barred doors. The convicts were then met by guards who fired at them, killing Makley and leaving Pierpont seriously wounded, while Clark and the other prisoners retreated back to their cells. Clark remained imprisoned in Columbus, Ohio for the next 34 years until being paroled for health reasons on August 14, 1968. He died of cancer in Detroit, Michigan on Christmas Eve only four months after his release. He was the last surviving member of the original Dillinger gang. In popular culture Clark has been featured in two crime novels, The Hunt (1991) by William Diehl and Handsome Harry: A Novel (2005) by James Carlos Blake.

His crime spree lasted nearly three months, ending in a two-hour shootout with the New York City Police Department on May 7, 1931, that was witnessed by 15,000 bystanders and received national attention. He became the archetype of the Irish gangster. In 1932 he was executed in New York's electric chair. Biography Francis Crowley was born in New York City on October 31, 1912, the second son of an unwed German mother who gave him up for adoption. He had a hatred for police, with some speculating that his absent father was a police officer. This hatred for the police was compounded by police killing his brother John when Crowley was 12 years old. John was alleged to be involved in the killing of NYPD Officer Maurice Harlow on February 22, 1925. Shortly thereafter John Crowley was killed in a confrontation with police officers while resisting arrest on a charge of disorderly conduct. By his late teens, Francis Crowley had a reputation as a troubled youth with a criminal history. Crime spree On February 21, 1931, Crowley and two other young men crashed a dance hosted by the American Legion in the Bronx. Several Legionnaires tried to remove them from the venue, so Crowley drew a gun and wounded two men before fleeing. He was charged with attempted murder and went into hiding. He was confronted by police on March 13. He escaped into an office building on Lexington Avenue after shooting Detective Ferdinand Schaedel. Two days later, Crowley and four others robbed a bank in New Rochelle, New York. A month later, Crowley and two friends broke into the West 90th Street apartment of real estate broker Rudolph Adler. Adler attempted to resist them, and Crowley shot him five times using two pistols, which earned him the nickname \\"Two Gun\\". Adler's dog Trixie attacked the robbers and drove them from the house, saving her owner's life. On April 27, Crowley was out joyriding in a stolen vehicle with his partner Rudolph \\"Fats\\" Durringer and dance hall hostess Virginia Brannen. Brannen resisted Durringer's advances, so Durringer shot and killed her while still in the car. Crowley then helped him dump her body at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. New York City police found Brannen's body and escalated their efforts to find Crowley. On April 29, he was spotted in the Bronx driving a green Chrysler Imperial sedan along 138th Street near the Morris Avenue Bridge. Police pursued him, but he escaped after a running gun battle. Detectives found that the bullets extracted from a police car matched those that killed Virginia Brannen and those from other unsolved shootings. The following day, Crowley's car was found abandoned with bullet holes and bloodstains on the inside. On May 6, Crowley was sitting in a parked car with his 16-year-old girlfriend Helen Walsh on Morris Lane in North Merrick, Long Island when he was approached by police officers Frederick Hirsch and Peter Yodice, who asked for identification. Crowley fired at them, killing Hirsch and wounding Yodice. He then sped off. Capture The following day Crowley, Helen Walsh, and Fats Durringer were tracked down to a fifth-floor apartment in a rooming house on West 91st Street. The residence belonged to a former lover of Crowley, who notified the police upon seeing Crowley with another woman. Outside the building they assembled a force of 300 police officers armed with rifles, machine guns, and tear gas. The events attracted 15,000 bystanders. Crowley and the police exchanged gunfire for nearly 2 hours, with the police firing an estimated 700 rounds into the building. While Walsh and Durringer reloaded Crowley's pistols, Crowley threw back several tear gas grenades that the police had thrown into the apartment through a hole cut into the roof. After suffering four gunshot wounds and bleeding heavily, he finally surrendered. Arresting officers found two pistols strapped to his legs. Trial and execution On May 29, less than three weeks after his arrest, Crowley was tried and convicted of the murder of police officer Frederick Hirsch on May 29. His partner, Fats Durringer, was found guilty of the murder of Virginia Brannen. Both men were sentenced to death on June 1. Crowley was sentenced to death by electric chair. Crowley spent his last year on death row at Sing Sing Prison in Ossining, New York. He remained a disciplinary problem–stuffing his prison uniform down a toilet, setting fire to his bed, and frequently crafting homemade weapons. His attitude became somewhat more serene as his execution neared: he reportedly adopted a starling that frequently flew into his cell. On January 21,1932, Crowley's last words to Warden Lewis Lawes were to ask for a rag. referring to Durringer's death in the same electric chair, Crowley said, \\"I want to wipe off the chair after this rat sat in it.\\" It is not clear if the request was granted. Crowley was 19 when he was executed.

It was named by David Eppstein after the twelve-pointed star in the flag of Nauru. It has chromatic number 2, chromatic index 3, diameter 4, radius 4 and girth 6.Conder, M. and Dobcsányi, P. \\"Trivalent Symmetric Graphs Up to 768 Vertices.\\" J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 40, 41-63, 2002. It is also a 3-vertex-connected and 3-edge-connected graph. It has book thickness 3 and queue number 2.Wolz, Jessica; Engineering Linear Layouts with SAT. Master Thesis, University of Tübingen, 2018 The Nauru graph requires at least eight crossings in any drawing of it in the plane. It is one of five non-isomorphic graphs tied for being the smallest cubic graph that requires eight crossings. Another of these five graphs is the McGee graph, also known as the (3-7)-cage... Construction The Nauru graph is Hamiltonian and can be described by the LCF notation : [5, −9, 7, −7, 9, −5]4.Eppstein, D., The many faces of the Nauru graph, 2007. The Nauru graph can also be constructed as the generalized Petersen graph G(12, 5) which is formed by the vertices of a dodecagon connected to the vertices of a twelve-point star in which each point of the star is connected to the points five steps away from it. There is also a combinatorial construction of the Nauru graph. Take three distinguishable objects and place them in four distinguishable boxes, no more than one object per box. There are 24 ways to so distribute the objects, corresponding to the 24 vertices of the graph. If it is possible to go from one state to another state by moving exactly one object from its present location to an empty box, then the vertices corresponding to the two states are joined by an edge. The resulting state-transition graph is the Nauru graph. Algebraic properties The automorphism group of the Nauru graph is a group of order 144.Royle, G. F024A data It is isomorphic to the direct product of the symmetric groups S4 and S3 and acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore, the Nauru graph is a symmetric graph (though not distance transitive). It has automorphisms that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge. According to the Foster census, the Nauru graph is the only cubic symmetric graph on 24 vertices. The generalized Petersen graph G(n,k) is vertex-transitive if and only if n = 10 and k =2 or if k2 ≡ ±1 (mod n) and is edge-transitive only in the following seven cases: (n,k) = (4,1), (5,2), (8,3), (10,2), (10,3), (12,5), (24,5).. So the Nauru graph is one of only seven symmetric Generalized Petersen graphs. Among these seven graphs are the cubical graph G(4,1), the Petersen graph G(5,2), the Möbius–Kantor graph G(8,3), the dodecahedral graph G(10,2) and the Desargues graph G(10,3). The Nauru graph is a Cayley graph of S4, the symmetric group of permutations on four elements, generated by the three different ways of swapping the first element with one of the three others : (1 2), (1 3) and (1 4). The characteristic polynomial of the Nauru graph is equal to :(x-3) (x-2)^6 (x-1)^3 x^4 (x+1)^3 (x+2)^6 (x+3),\\\\ making it an integral graph—a graph whose spectrum consists entirely of integers. Topological properties A symmetric embedding of the Nauru graph on a genus-4 surface, with six dodecagonal faces. The Nauru graph has two different embeddings as a generalized regular polyhedron: a topological surface partitioned into edges, vertices, and faces in such a way that there is a symmetry taking any flag (an incident triple of a vertex, edge, and face) into any other flag.. One of these two embeddings forms a torus, so the Nauru graph is a toroidal graph: it consists of 12 hexagonal faces together with the 24 vertices and 36 edges of the Nauru graph. The dual graph of this embedding is a symmetric 6-regular graph with 12 vertices and 36 edges. The other symmetric embedding of the Nauru graph has six dodecagonal faces, and forms a surface of genus 4. Its dual is not a simple graph, since each face shares three edges with four other faces, but a multigraph. This dual can be formed from the graph of a regular octahedron by replacing each edge with a bundle of three parallel edges. The set of faces of any one of these two embeddings is the set of Petrie polygons of the other embedding. Geometric properties The Nauru graph as a unit distance graph, from . As with all generalized Petersen graphs, the Nauru graph can be represented by points in the plane in such a way that adjacent vertices are at unit distance apart; that is, it is a unit distance graph.. It and the prisms are the only generalized Petersen graphs G(n,p) that cannot be so represented in such a way that the symmetries of the drawing form a cyclic group of order n. Instead, its unit distance graph representation has the dihedral group Dih6 as its symmetry group. History The first person to write about the Nauru graph was R. M. Foster, in an effort to collect all the cubic symmetric graphs.. The whole list of cubic symmetric graphs is now named after him the Foster Census and inside this list the Nauru graph is numbered graph F24A but has no specific name.. In 1950, H. S. M. Coxeter cited the graph a second time, giving the Hamiltonian representation used to illustrate this article and describing it as the Levi graph of a projective configuration discovered by Zacharias... In 2003, Ed Pegg wrote in his online MAA column that F24A deserves a name but did not propose one.. Finally, in 2007, David Eppstein used the name Nauru graph because the flag of the Republic of Nauru has a 12-point star similar to the one that appears in the construction of the graph as a generalized Petersen graph.

He was especially active in Oklahoma, referred to by authorities as \\"The Fox\\", and frequently teamed with Jim Clark and Frank Sawyer during the early 1930s. Eventually captured in 1934, he was involved in a failed escape attempt from Folsom State Prison, resulting in the deaths of one guard and two inmates, and was executed at San Quentin.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 76-77) Biography Early life and criminal career Ed Davis was born in Waurika, Oklahoma on July 30, 1900. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at the age of 17 but was prematurely discharged for undisclosed reasons on January 2, 1918. He spent the next year drifting then returned to his hometown where he started committing minor robberies with Oscar Steelman and Earl Berry. He was eventually arrested for one of these robberies and sentenced to two years in the Oklahoma State Reformatory. Released in the summer of 1920, he took a freight train heading east and continued riding the rails until his arrest in Hutchinson, Kansas for train riding and carrying a concealed weapon. The charges were dropped on the condition that Davis leave town which he did after purchasing a train ticket on a box car. His next brush with the law occurred on January 23, 1923, when he and Bill Sheppard burglarized the home of oil tycoon Joe McDonald stealing $50 in cash and $2,425 in jewelry. Davis and Sheppard then hiked five miles north to their Agawam hideout however police were easily able to follow their tracks through the fresh snow and arrested them hours later. Both men pleaded guilty to robbery charges and sentenced to 10 years each at the McAlester state prison. By the time of his parole in 1928, Davis had become more violent and would frequently resist police for the rest of his criminal career. He had also developed an ear infection which left him in almost persistent pain. Murder of J.R. Hill One of his early confrontations with the police occurred in Marlow, Oklahoma on April 20, 1931. He was sitting in a car with two other men, Jack Alfred and John Schrimsher, when night police chief Ike Veach and officer J.R. Hill saw them on a routine patrol and decided to approach the car. All three men were heavily armed and one of them fired a shotgun which shattered the windshield and killed Hill instantly. Sheriff Veach was also badly wounded from buckshot but returned fire managing to disable their car and wounding Alfred before they escaped. All three men were caught after a brief manhunt. Alfred was the first to be arrested and was sent to a hospital in Duncan, Oklahoma where he awaited trial. Schrimsher surrendered to authorities near Henderson, Texas on October 24 while Davis was found in an East Texas oil field the next day and taken into custody.Owens, Ron. Oklahoma Heroes: The Oklahoma Peace Officers Memorial. Paducah, Kentucky: Turner Publishing Company, 2000. (pg. 236) At the time of his capture, he was renting a house with his wife under the name Paul Martin in Joinerville. Davis and his accomplices were tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment on August 3, 1931. Escape from McAlester After nine months in prison, Davis escaped the McAlester state penitentiary with Robert Smith and Edmond Hardin on May 26, 1932. Hardin was quickly recaptured while still on foot but Davis and Smith were able to escape by stealing a car. Davis then attempted to try his hand at bank robbery and joined veteran outlaws Jim Clark and Frank Sawyer. The gang's time was short-lived however. On June 17, the three were arrested by police near Black Rock, Arkansas. In addition to driving a stolen car, they were also charged with a bank robbery carried out hours before in Fort Scott, Kansas. The robbery was actually committed by the Barker Gang, however Davis and his partners were wrongly convicted on the robbery and given long jail terms. Time with the Bailey-Underhill Gang Davis escaped from prison once again, this time taking part in a mass escape from the Kansas state prison in Lansing on May 30, 1933. He was one of twelve convicts including Harvey Bailey, Robert \\"Big Bob\\" Brady, Wilbur Underhill, Jim Clark and seven others. He briefly joined Bailey-Underhill gang in two major robberies, first as the getaway driver in Black Rock on June 16Yadon, Laurence J. and Dan Anderson. 200 Texas Outlaws and Lawmen, 1835-1935. Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2008. (pg. 72) and in Kingfisher, Oklahoma on August 9, Davis later being identified with Clark and Bailey from prison mugshots. Bailey was arrested at a ranch by federal agents two days later, the FBI then looking for George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly, and was wrongly charged as an accessory to the Charles Urchel kidnapping case. With Bailey in jail, the Bailey-Underhill gang broke up and Davis decided to strike out alone. He began a one man crime spree raiding countless banks in central Texas with such success that police began referring to him as \\"The Fox\\". By late- September 1933, Davis decided he had gained enough money to retire and moved with his wife to California. He was also considering surgical removal of various prison tattoos. Capture, imprisonment and death However, Governor Alf Landon had ordered the Kansas state police to \\"spare no effort\\" in hunting down the escapees from Lansing prison. Within two months, only Davis and Wilbur Underhill remained at large. Underhill was gunned down by Oklahoma police on December 30, 1933, while Davis was captured months later. Running out of money while living in Los Angeles, he robbed a store and then kidnapped its owner J.J. Ball. He was quickly arrested and tried on a series of charges including three counts of first-degree burglary, six counts of robbery and two counts of kidnapping. A second version claims he was captured by police in an apartment-house raid in March 1934.Wallis, Michael. Pretty Boy: The Life and Times of Charles Arthur Floyd. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992. (pg. 326) Davis was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in Folsom State Prison on June 22, 1934. Kansas authorities declared they would prosecute Davis to finish his prison sentence in Lansing if he ever received parole. While serving his time in Folsom, he became known among the inmates as \\"Old Deafy\\". Davis eventually tried to escape after three years inside when, on September 19, 1937, he and six other convicts took the warden and two guards hostage. They held them at knifepoint and attempted to use them to leave the prison but guards opened fire instead. The warden and two prisoners were killed before Davis and the surviving convicts surrendered. All five inmates were convicted of murder, including Davis, and sentenced to death. Davis was sent to San Quentin where he remained on death row for a week before his execution in the gas chamber on December 16, 1938. A note was found in his cell following his execution which read \\"No regrets for Old Ed. All considered, my conscience is now resting easy\\".

It was released in Europe on April 30, 2010, and in North America on May 4 for Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, Wii, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable. Published by Sega, the game was developed by Sega Studios San Francisco for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS by High Voltage Software for Wii and PlayStation Portable, and by Gameloft for iOS (released on May 3) and BlackBerry PlayBook (released on August 25). A Microsoft Windows version was planned, but was cancelled. The game has an original story written by The Invincible Iron Man author, Matt Fraction. This story is set after the plot of the film, although the iOS and BlackBerry versions stick roughly to the film's plot. The game features the voices of Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson, reprising their roles from the film. Gameplay Players can play as either Iron Man or War Machine, each with their own unique style. While Iron Man is sleeker and relies much more on energy weapons, War Machine is outfitted with ballistic weaponry and tougher armour. Iron Man can choose from multiple suits of armour, including Marks II through VI. Players can customize upgrades and weaponry on the armour. Weapons can also be switched during gameplay. Flight control has been improved upon since the first game, as has melee combat, allowing players to get near to the ground. AI was also updated from the previous title. New enemies have been included, and new strategies are now available in combat. In the Wii/PlayStation Portable version, simplified graphics, different combat systems (not using melee during midair) and different missions are added. Flying across levels was removed, instead letting Iron Man hover or walk across the level. The point of view was also changed. Also included are \\"Tech Trophies\\", collectibles which can be used as upgrades, while \\"Ammo Cases\\" are used to supply ammunition. Synopsis The game begins with Iron Man (voiced by Eric Loomis) defending the Dataspine, an archived version of J.A.R.V.I.S. (Andrew Chaikin), from attackers. However, an EMP bomb is dropped, disabling him. Three hours earlier, Tony Stark had recorded a journal message in which he mentions the Roxxon Energy Corporation, and how they tried to duplicate the Iron Man armour without success. Tony is then interrupted by James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes (Don Cheadle), who says that there is trouble at Stark Archives. Following the EMP bomb, the power reserves in Iron Man's armour activate, and upon recovering, Iron Man learns that Roxxon is behind the attack. He grimly decides that he should destroy the Dataspine to keep Roxxon from getting the archives. Outside, Rhodey, in his War Machine armour, intercepts some Roxxon Dropships. Iron Man makes contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who informs him that separatists under the command of a General Shatalov (Dimitri Diatchenko) have seized control of a Tesla facility. During Iron Man's escort of S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter forces, they are attacked by a battle platform called the Roxxon Armiger. After destroying it, Iron Man and War Machine head to a battlecruiser and destroy it, learning the Armiger was remote-controlled. They discover that Shatalov is working with the terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics to create the Crimson Dynamo suit. Upon learning that the suit is being developed at a power plant in Siberia, Fury reveals that he has sent Natasha Romanoff (Catherine Campion), the Black Widow, to spy on the plant. Iron Man battles General Shatalov inside the Crimson Dynamo armor. At the plant, Shatalov makes contact with A.I.M.'s Kearson DeWitt (Doug Boyd), who tells him that there is a spy in his ranks, displeased that he has brought S.H.I.E.L.D. to their front door. Shatalov gives orders to prep the Crimson Dynamo armour and then informs his men that their connection with A.I.M. is now severed. Iron Man finds and protects Natasha from Shatalov's men and a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport is sent to their location. Natasha is extracted while Iron Man and War Machine battle Shatalov in his Crimson Dynamo armor. The defeated Shatalov reveals that A.I.M. was behind the theft of J.A.R.V.I.S.'s AI, and are planning to use it to create Ultimo. The team learns that Kearson DeWitt was behind the attack led by Shatalov and that he had previously worked at Stark's Theoretical Weapons Division until Stark shut it down. Aside from DeWitt working on the prototype of the arc reactor, Pepper Potts (Meredith Monroe) also reveals that he had a secret project called PROTEAN. Inside an A.I.M. base, DeWitt uses his PROTEAN technology to merge with an enormous metal suit and become Ultimo. With the merge complete, DeWitt has his men upgraded with PROTEAN implants. Arriving at the base, War Machine battles PROTEAN drones while Iron Man searches for DeWitt. J.A.R.V.I.S. detects Ultimo shortly after the base is secured with help from S.H.I.E.L.D. Meanwhile, the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier is attacked, and Iron Man protects it from DeWitt's drones. When War Machine defeats an Arc Armiger dropped on the helicarrier, Iron Man decides to reprogram it. Using the reprogrammed Armiger, Iron Man and War Machine assault an A.I.M. base in Malaysia. When the giant Ultimo arrives, War Machine disables some of its arc reactors while Iron Man fights the DeWitt/Ultimo within. Upon defeating DeWitt/Ultimo, Iron Man learns that the effects on DeWitt are irreversible. War Machine finishes Ultimo off while the helicarrier rams it. Afterward, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Stark to promise him never to let anyone gain access to his programming again. Development Iron Man 2 was written by The Invincible Iron Man scribe Matt Fraction, Sega creative director Kyle Brink, with additional writing by Sega writer Phil Campbell and Sega associate producer Stephen Frost. The game features an exclusive song recorded by Lamb of God, \\"Hit the Wall\\", along with a soundtrack composed by other bands. Audio Unlike the original Iron Man video game, Robert Downey, Jr. does not voice Iron Man, who is instead voiced by Eric Loomis (who would go on to play the character in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes animated series and the video game Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds). Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles as War Machine and Nick Fury, respectively. Cheadle and Jackson are the only actors from the film to return to voice their video game counterparts. Veteran voice actors Steven Blum and Phil LaMarr also lend their talent, with Steven Blum voicing the characters Mauler and Ghost, while Phil LaMarr provides additional dialogue for War Machine. Veteran animator Eric Goldberg voiced A.I.M. soldiers. John Eric Bentley also provided additional dialogue for Nick Fury. Reception The game has received generally unfavorable reviews, with Metacritic scores of 44 and 45 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, respectively. There is division among critics as to whether or not the game is an improvement over its predecessor. IGN gave a score of 5.1 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 version, 5.5 for the Wii version and 4.9 for the PSP version. They felt the game was an improvement upon the original, but still did not quite hit the mark, citing poor graphics, a five-hour playing time, repetitive dodging and action, and a lack of challenge, which made the upgrade system unnecessary; \\"Iron Man 2 isn't terrible, but it rarely gets exciting. It's fun to blow up tanks and trucks, and Iron Man has all his powers like his repulsor shots and his unibeam laser. But the whole game feels repetitive. You see the same enemies over and over again, and even though they get bigger guns and more armor as you go, the gameplay stays the same. The PSP version features even fewer guys than the Wii game, so a lot of times areas just seem empty because there aren't artillery trucks rolling up and dumping out bad guys\\". Michael Lafferty from GameZone gave it a 4.5, suggesting that players should \\"watch the movie, read the comic book, but pass on the game\\". GameSpot also gave it a 4.5, arguing that \\"every decent element is overshadowed by stumbles and shortcomings. It should be thrilling and fun to take to the sky in a superpowered battle suit, but Iron Man 2 crashes to the Earth with a dull thud\\". Empire magazine gave it one star, calling it a \\"rare failure for Sega\\", and stating that the experience felt like an early PlayStation 1 game.

Their unsuccessful robbery of Southern Pacific Railroad express train and the murder of four crew members, known as the Siskiyou massacre, was subject to one of the largest and most extensive investigations in the region. The brothers were eventually identified with the assistance of forensic scientist Edward Heinrich, and they were captured after a four-year nationwide manhunt.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 78-79) Early lives Twin brothers Ray and Roy DeAutremont were born March 30, 1900, in Iowa, and their younger brother Hugh was born on February 21, 1904, in Arkansas. They were the sons of Paul P. DeAutremont, who was of French descent, and Isabella Bertha (née Wombacher), who was of German descent. Their father ran a barber shop in Albany, Oregon and all three brothers worked as lumberjacks. Ray was involved in the emerging labor union movement and the Industrial Workers of the World during his youth. He was sent to a reformatory in Monroe, Washington in 1919 for his affiliation with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW or \\"Wobblies\\") and spent nearly a year there. When Hugh graduated from high school in New Mexico in June 1923, he joined his brothers in a logging camp near Silverton, Oregon. Train robbery The three DeAutremont brothers worked in Silverton for four months until October 11, 1923, when they attempted to rob Southern Pacific Railroad Train No. 13 then traveling south through the Siskiyou Mountains (which span northwestern California and southwestern Oregon). The express train was only a few miles from the Siskyou station when they boarded the train, waiting for the locomotive and first three cars to pass before jumping onto the car, and forced the engineer Arnold Bates to stop the train while most of it was still inside the 3,000-ft. tunnel. The brothers were armed with sawed-off shotguns, and while Roy watched the engineer, Ray and Hugh went ahead to the mail coach which was carrying an estimated $40,000. When postal clerk Elvyn Dougherty saw the two approach the mail car, he closed the door and Hugh fired his shotgun twice. Ray then attached a dynamite charge to the mail car's door and ran for cover with his brothers. Roy DeAutremont described what happened in a sworn statement years later, The brothers were then forced to flee empty-handed while a second conductor ran to a nearby emergency phone and reported the robbery to authorities in Ashland, Oregon. Police investigators later found a detonator and a discarded .45 caliber pistol at the scene along with three gunny sacks which had been soaked in creosote and dragged along the ground to throw bloodhounds off their trail. The search party fanned out from Tunnel 13 and discovered a black traveling bag with a railroad shipping tag and a pair of green overalls. Over a dozen suspects were jailed and questioned, but local authorities made little headway in solving the case. Dr. Edward Heinrich, a chemistry professor at the University of California, was brought in and was able to use early forensic methods to accurately provide a description of the suspects for police. Upon examining the green overalls found by investigators, Heinrich reported that the suspect was a left-handed lumberjack, approximately 25 years old, with brown hair and fair complexion, was 5'8 in height and weighed 165 pounds, and was described as a man with fastidious habits. He further explained his findings were based on specific evidence gathered by his investigation of the overalls, which included strands of hair and the presence of Douglas fir needles and fresh pitch from pine trees. The overalls were worn only on the right side, suggesting the same position a left-hander would take as if he were to lean against a tree while swinging an ax. The suspect's height and weight were estimated from the size of the overalls, and the \\"fastidious habits\\" were evidenced by some neatly-cut fingernail clippings found in the pocket. In addition, the receipt for a registered letter was found in the pocket, which police later traced to a $50 money order sent by Roy DeAutremont to his brother Hugh in Lakewood, New Mexico on September 14, 1923. Investigators then questioned Paul d'Autremont, who confirmed that all three sons were lumberjacks and that Roy was left-handed. The .45 Colt weapon found at the crime scene was traced to William Elliott, whose handwriting matched that of Roy DeAutremont, and the railroad express tags found on the suitcase revealed that Roy had mailed it to himself from Eugene to Portland on January 21 of that year. Although there was enough evidence to identify the DeAutremont brothers as the most likely suspects, apprehending them was another matter, as all three had disappeared since the incident. The federal government offered a $6,000 reward for their capture with an additional $7,000 added by Southern Pacific and $900 from the Railway Express Company. News of the Siskiyou massacre had attracted national attention by this time, and investigators received reports of numerous sightings, following every one of these new leads, but none of these panned out. The U.S. government eventually issued 2,265,000 wanted posters printed in English and five other languages, which were then distributed internationally. Arrests and convictions After several months with no new leads, investigators were on the verge of giving up. However, a corporal named Thomas Reynolds came forward and identified Hugh DeAutremont as James Price, who had been an acquaintance of his while serving with the United States Army in the Philippines. He had only recently been stationed on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, California when he recognized DeAutremont from a wanted poster and reported this to his superior officers. Hugh DeAutremont was arrested within six hours, and while admitting his true identity in custody, he was able to stall his extradition to the United States until March 1927. Once back in the United States, Hugh DeAutremont was tried and convicted of first degree murder. Hugh DeAutremont denied knowledge of his brothers' whereabouts, but his capture encouraged federal authorities to redistribute new wanted posters. Within two months, a report was received that Ray and Roy DeAutremont had been seen in Portsmouth, Ohio and were discovered to be living in nearby Steubenville under the assumed names of Clarence and Elmer Goodwin. They were arrested by FBI agents on June 8, 1927, and offered no resistance. The twin brothers later claimed they had fled to Detroit after the robbery. Ray had married while in Detroit and moved to Hanging Rock, with his brother following him several months later. They kept on the move, living in both Portsmouth and Steubenville, before they were recognized when the new wanted posters were issued. Ray had previously bleached his hair but this failed to disguise him. The two were quickly extradited to Jackson County, Oregon where they stood trial for their role in the Siskiyou massacre. Their arrival coincided with Hugh's murder trial, although this fact was withheld from the defendant. Hugh was convicted of first degree murder, even though jurors recommended leniency and Roy and Ray DeAutremont both pleaded guilty to the same charges. All three were sentenced to life imprisonment at the Oregon state prison in Salem, Oregon. Later years and deaths Hugh DeAutremont was paroled in 1958. He moved to San Francisco where he worked as a printer. He was diagnosed with stomach cancer three months after his release and died on March 30, 1959.Yuskavitch 2006 p.14 Roy DeAutremont was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1949 and was transferred to Oregon State Hospital in Salem, Oregon. He later underwent a frontal lobotomy which left him unable to care for himself. In 1979, he was transferred to a Salem nursing home where he received 24-hour care. Roy was granted parole in March 1983. He died at the nursing home where he had resided since 1979 on June 17, 1983 at the age of 83. Ray DeAutremont was the last of the brothers to be released from prison, on October 27, 1961. He was questioned by reporters while leaving the prison, and when asked how it felt to be released, he replied, \\"I'm trying to think of something to say. Well you can imagine how it feels, can't you? But one thing is for sure: For the rest of my life I will struggle with the question of whatever possessed us to do such a thing?\\" After his release, Ray lived in Eugene, Oregon, where he worked as a janitor on the weekends at the University of Oregon. He also spent his time painting and studying French and Spanish. In 1972, then-governor Tom McCall commuted Ray's sentence after he requested \\"to be a free man before I die\\". Ray DeAutremont died in a Eugene nursing home on December 20, 1984 at the age of 84. All three DeAutremont brothers are buried next to their mother in Belcrest Memorial Cemetery in Salem, Oregon. It is possible that the robbery inspired the opening train robbery and murder scenes in the 1949 movies White HeatFrancis \\"Two Gun\\" Crowley, Ma Barker's Son and the \\"Gold Special\\" Train Robbers and Special Agent.

He used a number of different aliases during his criminal career including George Davis, George Harris and J.B. King. He was the longtime partner of George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly. He also took part in the kidnapping of oil magnate Charles Urschel in July of 1933. Biography Albert Bates was born on October 16, 1893, to Elizabeth Mary Hughes and Wiley Bates. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1911 but was arrested for desertion and sent to the military prison on Alcatraz where he stayed for 15 months. Albert Bates was first arrested in Nevada for burglary on March 28, 1916, and was sentenced to serve 1 to 15 years at the state prison in Carson City. He was paroled on November 13, 1917, and was out for less than half-a- year when he was arrested for burglary in Ogden, Utah, on April 22, 1920. He was convicted on August 3, 1921, and sentenced to five years at the Utah state prison where he remained for five years. Bates would continuously be in trouble with the law throughout his criminal career, particularly as a young man, and was imprisoned in the Colorado state penitentiary in Cañon City for a third burglary conviction on May 10, 1927.Newton, Michael.

(pg. 28-40, 87-88, 338-339) By the time of his release on July 17, 1930, again being granted parole, Bates had become a hardened criminal. He soon joined up with bank robber \\"Machine Gun Kelly\\", who had been released from Leavenworth a month before Bates, and together robbed their first bank in Denton, Texas, with several others on February 6, 1932. Seven months later, he and Kelly teamed with Eddie Bentz to rob a bank on Colfax, Washington, of $77,000 in cash and bonds on September 21. He and Kelly, this time with Eddie Doll, hit another bank in Tupelo, Mississippi, for $38,000 on November 30, 1932. This robbery was one of many wrongly attributed to Pretty Boy Floyd by authorities.Newton, Michael. The FBI Encyclopedia. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, 2003. (pg. 178) With violent shootouts between outlaws and law enforcement on the rise in 1932 and 1933, Bates and Kelly began considering kidnapping. They may have been encouraged by the successful 1933 kidnapping of brewer William Hamm for $100,000 as they soon began planning the kidnapping of Charles Urschell, a wealthy oil tycoon in Oklahoma City. On July 22, 1933, Bates and Kelly abducted Urschell from his home at gunpoint and drove him to a Texas ranch owned by Kelly's in-laws. They eventually received a $200,000 ransom and Urschell was safely released on July 31.Owens, Ron. Oklahoma Justice: A Century of Gunfighters, Gangsters and Terrorists.

The ranch was eventually discovered by authorities, reports vary between detective work by the FBI or a tip received from local authorities, and federal agents raided the ranch on August 12 arresting three of Kelly's in-laws and a visiting Harvey Bailey. Bates was arrested the same day in Denver for passing stolen checks. Although Kelly would evade authorities for another month, Bates and the rest involved in the Urschall kidnapping were convicted in federal court on September 30, 1933. All were sentenced to life imprisonment a week later with Bates being sent to Alcatraz where he was later joined by his partner Kelly. Bates died of a stabbing on July 4, 1948, and is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. References Further reading *Breuer, William B. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men.

Family Baron Karl von Meck came from an old Baltic-German noble family originally from Silesia. His father was major Otto Adam von Meck, a customs officer in Riga. His mother was Wilhelmine Hafferberg, a daughter of Friedrich Wilhelm and Catharine Constanze Nott, who in her second marriage was the wife of Carl Ludwig von Veichtner, a son of composer Franz Adam Veichtner. In 1844 Karl von Meck graduated from the St. Petersburg Institute of Communications and joined the Moscow-Warsaw road upgrade project as a service road engineer. In 1860 von Meck left public service and entered business. After the military defeat in Crimea many people became aware of the importance of rail transportation. Von Meck entered the Saratov Railway Association with the aim of constructing a private rail line between Moscow and Saratov with independent finance. The first phase of construction was the line between Moscow and Kolomna. This site was put into operation, after only two years work, as the funds of the company had been exhausted and the entire operation quickly went bankrupt. Karl von Meck persevered and in 1863 found work with the new Moscow-Ryazan Railway Association. The Chairman of the Board appointed von Meck as the main contractor and the road was built over a year and a half, and made an enormous profit. Karl von Meck participated in several other railway ventures but none with such financial success. However his diligence, tenacity and effort were widely recognised and acknowledged. After his death his widow, Nadezhda von Meck, provided invaluable assistance to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Karl von Meck's son, Nikolai von Meck, played a significant role in the development of Russian railways and worked on the People's Commissariat of Railroads until he was arrested for wrecking in 1928.

He was one of Pretty Boy Floyd's closest known associates and also teamed with a number of fellow Oklahoma-based bandits, most notably, William \\"Billy the Killer\\" Miller and Aussie Elliott.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 34-35) Biography Early life and criminal career George Birdwell was born in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in 1894, his ancestry being a mix of Irish, Cherokee and Choctaw. Published accounts of his background and early life are vague and inconsistent, however public records indicate that he was shot by a local farmer over an alleged affair with his wife when he was 18. While crime author Myron Quimby claimed that Birdwell began his life of crime during the 1920s committing 10 murders and robbed \\"countless\\" banks, he provided little evidence to support these claims of his early criminal career. Birdwell's children and surviving descendants, however, have always maintained that Birdwell had worked as a farmer until meeting with bank robber Pretty Boy Floyd in 1930 and began robbing banks with him soon after. Indeed, local residents recalled Birdwell often passing out $20 to his neighbors during the Great Depression, particularly those affected by the Great Dust Bowl, and gained him considerable public support and sympathy. Partnership with Pretty Boy Floyd Birdwell's first recorded robbery was on March 9, 1931, when he and Floyd joined William \\"Billy the Killer\\" Miller in robbing a bank in Earlsboro, Oklahoma, for $3,000. Five months later, they raided another bank in nearby Shamrock but managed to get only $400. They fared better several days later when they raided a bank in Morris, Oklahoma for $1,743 on September 8 and scored another $3,850 from a bank in Maud three weeks later. On October 19, he and Floyd returned to Earlsboro and robbed the same bank they had originally raided with Miller seven months before, this time getting $2,498. They continued on their crime spree stealing $2,500 in Conowa on November 5, 1931 and another $2,500 in Castle, Oklahoma, on January 14, 1932. He was also believed to have been the unidentified accomplice who helped Floyd robbed $800 from a bank in Dover a week later. By early-1932, bankers across the state were petitioning the governor to take action against Birdwell and Floyd. After Floyd began renting a home in Tulsa for his wife and child, a confrontation between police became even more likely. Soon afterwards, on February 7, police saw the two fugitives driving through the city and attempted to pursue but lost them after a wild gunfight which resulted in the shooting of a police officer. Three days later, they were again confronted by the authorities when police surrounded Floyd's home and attempted to force the outlaws out. Birdwell and Floyd managed to sneak out the back way as police fired tear gas into the house. Birdwell and Floyd showed no signs of ceasing their activities despite their narrow escape as, six weeks after their escape from Tulsa, they robbed yet another bank in Meeker, Oklahoma, for $500 on March 23. When Birdwell's father died a month later, local sheriff's deputies staked out the funeral home in Earlsboro hoping to capture Birdwell if he showed up. The bandits did indeed arrive at the funeral home but unexpectedly turned the tables on the lawmen when Floyd held them at gunpoint while Birdwell was able to pay his last respects. The next day, on April 21, they took $600 from the cash drawers of a bank in Stonewall, Oklahoma. While driving near Ada on June 7, Birdwell and Floyd were ambushed in a police trap but managed to get away. Police sharpshooters later claimed that both men had most likely worn full body armor in order to have survived the gunfight. Five months later, he and Floyd committed one of their biggest bank jobs when they and Aussie Elliott stole $2,530 from a bank in Sallisaw, Oklahoma on November 1. They were, however, wrongly accused by authorities of robbing a bank in Henryetta of $11,252 six days later. Boley robbery and death Shortly afterwards, perhaps encouraged by the Henryetta robbery, Birdwell came up with a plan to rob the Farmers and Merchants Bank in Boley, Oklahoma. Floyd disagreed with the proposal pointing out that they would likely stand out in the heavily Black town and that local residents would most likely rush to the aid of the bank in the event of a robbery. Birdwell decided to go ahead with the robbery and recruited Charles Glass and C.C. Patterson. Birdwell failed to note that the day of the planned robbery, November 23, fell on the first day of bird-hunting season and residents were stocking up on shotguns and ammunition. The robbery proceeded as planned as Birdwell and his accomplices managed to gain entry into the bank. Birdwell, armed with a .45 caliber semi- automatic pistol, held everyone in the bank while Glass and Peterson looted the desk drawers. In one of the tellers' cages however, an automatic alarm was triggered when the last bills were taken. The alarm alerted bookmaker H.C. McCormick, who had been overlooked while at work in the back room, and confronted the men with a rifle shooting Birdwell through the heart. Mortally wounded, Birdwell managed to kill bank president D.J. Turner before collapsing. Glass and Paterson attempted to flee, however by this time local residents had been alerted by the gunfire and were waiting for them as they exited the bank. Opening fire, Glass was killed instantly and Paterson seriously wounded. He was saved by the town sheriff who intervened before the mob could fire a second volley. Patterson eventually recovered from his wounds and later sentenced to the state prison in McAlester. Birdwell was found alive in the bank and was taken to a nearby hospital in Henryetta but died shortly after his arrival. McCormick was later awarded $1,000 for his actions and made an honorary major in the state militia.

It is owned and run by the Batsford Foundation, a registered charity, and is open to the public daily throughout most of the year. The arboretum sits on the Cotswold scarp and contains around 2,900 trees, with a large collection of Japanese maples, magnolias and pines. It maintains the national collection of Prunus (sato-sakura Group) — Japanese Flowering Cherry — under the NCCPG National Plant Collection scheme run by the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens.NCCPG: Batsford Arboretum History The estate of Batsford Park was inherited in 1886 by Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale. He had travelled widely in Asia and developed the garden as a \\"wild\\" landscape with natural plantings inspired by Chinese and Japanese practice. He died in 1916 and was succeeded by David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, who was father of the famous Mitford sisters. They lived at Batsford during World War I, and Nancy Mitford based the early part of her novel Love in a Cold Climate on their time at Batsford. In 1919 the estate was sold to cover death duties to Gilbert Wills, 1st Baron Dulverton, an heir to the W.D. & H.O. Wills tobacco fortune. His wife Victoria further developed the garden and specimen tree plantings. After neglect during World War II the arboretum was revived by (Frederick) Anthony Hamilton Wills, 2nd Baron Dulverton (1915–1992), who succeeded in 1956. He consolidated and expanded the collections and brought Batsford into international repute. To ensure the survival of the arboretum he donated Batsford Park to a charitable trust in 1984. Apart from the arboretum, the remainder of the historic Batsford Estate is privately owned by (Gilbert) Michael Hamilton Wills, 3rd Baron Dulverton (born 1944).Batsford Estate The Development of the Arboretum Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford began development of the Arboretum soon after he inherited the Batsford estate in 1886. The design was based on observations of gardens he had seen in China and Japan. He made major landscape changes to the existing area. A newspaper article of the time described some of these in detail as follows. :\\"The first process was to hew a wide glace through the wood leaving here a lofty fir, there a group of hollies, and preserving a dense belt of trees to form a sheltering circumference. Next, a deep ravine was boldly gouged for half a mile or so, and by cunning engineering enough water was collected to send a small rill down it. Still, there were no rocks – not even a stone; and a rabine with earthen sides differs no whit from a railway cutting. These had all to be brought from a distance. Huge blocks from oolite limestone – many thousands of tons of them, some of them weighing each as much as seven tons were carted from a quarry about a mile off, and all these great slabs and blocks from one end of the glen to the other were laid so as to conform to the dip of the native beds so as to give the impression of a rocky gorge which to puny streamlet has prevailed to cut out in the course of ages. Of course cement had to be used but it has been used so cunningly as to deceive the very elect. Even the bed of the stream had to be laid in cement or the water would have soaked away out of sight.\\"Leamington Spa Courier and Warwickshire Standard, 2 September 1893, p. 6. The Japanese Rest house in 1917 Towards the end of his life Algernon wrote his memoirs and described his garden and the significance of the Budda statue, the bronze deer and the Rest House which he brought here in 1900 and are still in the Arboretum. Describing the Budda statue he said. :\\"High up in the wildest part of the wild garden, under the shade of a spreading oak, there stands, or rather sits, turned towards the East, as is fitting, a bronze statue of Buddha of heroic size. His hand is raised in the attitude of preaching ; his features are expressive of the holy calm and noble abstraction which are traditional in the effigies of the great reformer ; the centre of the skull is slightly raised, and between the brows is a curl, representing the wind, the mystic white lock.\\"Freeman-Mitford, Algernon 1917 “Further Memories”, p. 8. Online reference Gilbert Wills, 1st Baron Dulverton Algernon died in 1916 and his son David Mitford inherited the property. David was the father of the famous Mitford sisters who remember their time at Batsford with fondness. Nancy Mitford said in her memoirs that when at Batsford they \\"ran across country the beautiful bleak Cotswold uplands, starting soon after breakfast when the sun was still a red globe hardly over the horizon and the trees were etched in dark blue against a pale blue, mauve and pinkish sky\\".Thompson, Laura 2025 “Life in a Cold Climate: Nancy Mitford The Biography”. Online reference The Mitford family did not stay long at the property because of the large costs in running such a huge house.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation declared him a national \\"public enemy\\" when, in 1936, he and his partner Merle Vandenbush (June 15, 1907 – December 7, 1991)Mass Death record robbed a series of banks in the New York City area, and kidnapped New Jersey state trooper and former U.S. Marine William A. Turnbull on November 11, 1936. The New York City Police Department found Brunette and Vandenbush hiding out in an apartment on West 102nd Street, on December 14, 1936. Upon locating Brunette, the NYPD informed the FBI of the outlaws' whereabouts. Although this was done as a matter of professional courtesy, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover personally led a group of federal agents to take charge of the area.Cook, Fred J. The FBI Nobody Knows, Volume 2. New York: Macmillan, 1964. (pg. 196-200)Messick, Hank.

(pg. 164-165) At the time, the FBI was under heavy criticism from the press due to the bureau's overly-aggressive and stronghanded tactics, which had resulted in the shooting deaths of unarmed suspects and innocent bystanders. Hoover hoped to use the situation to set up a \\"personal arrest\\" by his second-in-command Clyde Tolson, for propaganda purposes, such as Hoover's own staged arrest of Alvin Karpis in 1936. Almost from the start, there were problems between the NYPD and the FBI. They had agreed the raid would take place that afternoon at 2:00 pm, when it was believed Brunette would be asleep. However, federal agents moved ahead with the raid and stormed the apartment building at midnight. Confused police detectives, still on stakeout, watched as the raid began 14 hours ahead of schedule. When police officers at the scene questioned Hoover, according to The New York Times, the director \\"merely shrugged his shoulders.\\" Within a few minutes, when a federal agent unsuccessfully attempted to shoot the lock off his door, Brunette was alerted and immediately returned fire. Gas grenades were tossed into his room, inadvertently starting a fire, and the New York City Fire Department was called. The arrival of firefighters added to the confused scene illustrated by a reporter from Newsweek, who described an incident between a firefighter and a federal agent: Brunette eventually surrendered, and Tolsen was photographed leading him away in his first arrest of his career. However, in their haste to arrest Brunette, federal agents missed Vandenbush, who easily escaped amid the chaos. The following morning, NYPD Commissioner Lewis Valentine and the New Jersey Police Commissioner issued public statements criticizing the FBI's breaking of its agreement with police and putting lives at risk, while allowing Vandenbush to escape. Hoover dismissed these objections, which he referred to as \\"unjustified and petty criticism\\". When Vandenbush was captured by Sgt. John C. Hergenhan and Patrolman William G. Hendricks (who both of them become Chief of North Castle Police Department) of North Castle, New York Police Department two months later on February 25, 1937. the fugitive claimed he had been on his way to meet with Brunette but was warned off by the obvious presence of the FBI.

It took part in raids across the English Channel and in the Mediterranean, ending the war in Italy as part of the 2nd Special Service Brigade. Like all Army commando units it was disbanded in 1946. Background The commandos were formed in 1940, by the order of Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister. He called for specially trained troops that would \\"develop a reign of terror down the enemy coast\\".Chappell, p. 5 At first it was a small force of volunteers who carried out small raids against enemy occupied territory,Chappell, p. 3 but by 1943 the unit's role had changed into lightly equipped assault Infantry which specialised in spearheading amphibious landings.Moreman, p. 8 The man initially selected as the overall commander of the force was Admiral Sir Roger Keyes; himself a veteran of the landings at Galipoli and the Zeebrugge raid in the First World War.Chappell, p. 6 Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Admiral Louis Mountbatten. By the autumn of 1940, more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training, and what became known as the Special Service Brigade was formed into 12 units called commandos.Haskew, p. 48 Each commando would number around 450 men, who were commanded by a lieutenant colonel. They were sub-divided into troops of 75 men and further divided into 15-man sections. Commandos were all volunteers seconded from other British Army regiments; they retained their own cap badges and remained on their regimental roll for pay.Moreman, p. 12 All volunteers went through the six-week intensive commando course at Achnacarry. The course in the Scottish Highlands, concentrated on fitness, speed marches, weapons training, map reading, climbing, small boat operations and demolitions, both by day and by night.van der Bijl, p. 12 By 1943 the commandos had moved away from small raiding operations and had been formed into brigades of assault infantry to spearhead future Allied landing operations. Three units were left un-brigaded to carry out smaller-scale raids.Moreman, pp. 84-85 History The men of No. 9 Commando were originally from No. 6 and No. 7 Independent Companies. They had been amalgamated in the autumn of 1940 in the 2nd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel J.M. Saegert. After the general reorganisation of the commando units, they were re-designated No. 9 Commando and based in Criccieth in Wales.Chappell 1996, p. 46.Moreman 2006, p. 18. No. 9 Commando undertook its first raid, Operation Sunstar, on the night of 22/23 November 1941 on the French coast at Houlgate. The raid was a success; the men landed and evacuated without any loss. After this raid, leadership of the commando was taken over by Lieutenant Colonel Ronnie Tod. The next operation that men from No. 9 were involved in was the St. Nazaire Raid in March 1942. The main landing force was provided by No. 2 Commando but most of the other commando units supplied demolition parties to assist in disabling the port facilities. A member of No. 9 Commando at Anzio, 5 March 1944 The men were then used to reinforce the Gibraltar garrison during Operation Torch, the landings in French North Africa. They remained in Gibraltar until November 1943 when they carried out raids on the islands of Tremiti and Pianosa. During the Allied invasion of Italy, as part of the 2nd Special Service Brigade the men were involved in Operation Partridge in December 1943 in the area of the Garigliano River. This was followed by Operation Shingle, the Anzio landings and fighting at Monte Ornito before being withdrawn to Naples in March 1943.

A boxer-turned-criminal, he committed numerous robberies during the 1920s and 1930s as well as being a longtime member of the Dillinger gang.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002.

Sentenced to five years imprisonment, he spent a year in the Anamosa state reformatory before his parole in March 1923. He continued to have run-ins with the law during the next few years, managing to avoid more jail time. He was twice charged with robbery, first in Kansas City on November 21, 1924 and again in St. Louis on August 11, 1925, and both cases were dropped. The following year, on August 28, 1926, he was jailed in St. Louis for auto theft but released without trial. He was picked up by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma for carrying a concealed weapon on September 15, but the charges were dropped. Returned to St. Joseph, he was arrested for bank robbery on September 29, 1926, and held until his trial and acquittal on January 11, 1927. On April 1, 1927, Carroll's luck ran out when he was convicted of armed robbery in Missouri and sentenced to five years imprisonment at the state prison in Jefferson City. He was later released on parole but only a brief time as he was quickly rearrested, tried and convicted under the newly passed Dyer Act and spent 21 months in Leavenworth prison until his parole in October 1931. Carroll disappeared for a year and a half before he was arrested in St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 17, 1933 for possession of burglar's tools. Carroll was able to negotiate his release and the charges against him were dropped. It was after this experience that Carroll became determined to break into major crime with a skilled team. Carroll and the Dillinger gang Carroll joined the John Dillinger gang sometime in late-1933 and participated in his first robbery with the gang on October 23, 1933, when he joined Baby Face Nelson, Homer Van Meter, John Paul Chase and Charles Fisher in the robbery of $32,000 from a bank in Brainerd, Minnesota. On November 11, he was spotted and pursued by two Minneapolis detectives, managing to escape. Carroll soon after traveled to San Antonio, Texas to purchase weapons from gunsmith Hyman Lehman on behalf of Nelson and the others. Carroll was forced to return when a chance encounter with police turned into a shootout, leaving Detective H.C. Perrow dead. In February 1934, Carroll was sent by Homer Van Meter to Crown Point, Indiana, to deliver a \\"cash payment\\" to help break John Dillinger from the local jail. Carroll was not yet an associate of Dillinger's and was easily able to pass through the town without notice. On March 3, Dillinger escaped from Crown Point and went to St. Paul where he met Carroll. Three days later, he joined Carroll, Van Meter, Nelson, John \\"Red\\" Hamilton and Eddie Green in stealing $49,500 from a bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Carroll was assigned to watch the street and captured twelve police officers single-handed. Nelson, however, shot and wounded motorcycle officer Hale Keith before they made their getaway back to St. Paul. Carroll was the wheelman a week later when the gang made their biggest score yet: on March 13, they robbed First National Bank in Mason City, Iowa of $52,344. Dillinger and Hamilton both suffered gunshot wounds when they left the bank and the gang fled to St. Paul. The robbery had attracted so much attention that they couldn't risk staying in the city long and decided to disappear for a while. The gang headed for Emil Wanatka's Little Bohemia Lodge near Rhinelander, Wisconsin a month later. The FBI followed the gang to their hideout and, on the night of April 22, Melvin Purvis led a raid against the lodge. The raid resulted in disaster, with Federal agents killing one civilian, Eugene Boisoneau, 35, from the Mercer CCC camp. Federal agents also wounded John Hoffman, 28, a gas station attendant and John Morris, 59, the Mercer CCC camp cook. Baby Face Nelson killed agent Carter Baum and wounded agent Jay Neuman and local constable Carl Christensen at Alvin Koerner's place, south of Little Bohemia. All the outlaws easily escaped. Carroll had fled through the woods and ended up in a nearby crossroads community. He then stole a car and drove down a logging road 12 miles north of the lodge. When the road turned out to be a dead end, he left the car and escaped on foot while federal agents were arresting the women who had been found at the lodge with the gang. Carroll's wife Jean Delaney Carroll (or Crompton), sister-in- law of Alvin Karpis, was among the women arrested and charged with harboring fugitives. She was later put on probation instead of serving a jail sentence. Carroll remained on the run with Dillinger and Van Meter for almost a month and eventually hid out in a cabin outside East Chicago, Indiana. On May 19, he and the rest of the gang were indicted by a federal grand jury in Madison, Wisconsin and charged with harboring each other as fugitives. Later that month, as the gang went their separate ways, Carroll was reunited with his wife, who violated her probation to join him. Death Carroll and his girlfriend, Jean Delaney (sister of Alvin Karpis' girlfriend Delores Delaney), managed to evade the authorities for only a few weeks following their departure from Dillinger. On Wednesday, June 6, 1934, they checked into the Evening Star Tourist Camp, about five miles south of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The next morning they drove to Waterloo, Iowa, arriving at 10:30 or 11, according to Delaney's later statement, with plans to get Delaney fitted for glasses. They ate breakfast, then Delaney bought a brown dress at 226 East 4th Street, which she put on and wore away from the store. The two then went to get Delaney's glasses. Delaney later told police that she had recently dyed her hair black. She said she had done so not with a view to hide her identity, but because she was tired of blonde hair, and that they had called her \\"Mae West\\" in jail at Madison. They stopped to fill up at a gas station, then headed to a beer parlor shortly after lunch. The station attendant had noticed a collection of out-of-state license plates in the back seat of Carroll's new bronze-colored Hudson sedan, motor No. 32148, with Missouri license 53970, and called local police after they had left. The attendant gave police the make of the car and the license plate number. Detectives Emil Steffen and P.E. Walker began cruising about looking for the suspicious vehicle without success and had returned to the station, when suddenly the car was spotted across the street. Carroll had carelessly parked the car across from the Waterloo police garage. Steffen and Walker watched a man and a woman come out of the beer parlor and walk to the Hudson. The detectives approached. Delaney got in the car. Walker said to Carroll, \\"You're under arrest.\\" \\"The hell I am,\\" answered Carroll. Carroll reached for his gun, dropping it underneath the car after Walker had given him a short left to the jaw, knocking him off balance. Carroll then ran into a nearby alley. Steffen and Walker opened fire, shooting five times, with four hitting Carroll. Three lodged in his chest and one pierced the fourth lumbar vertebrae of the spine. En route to the hospital, Carroll admitted who he was to the detectives. Steffen attempted to get further information, but Carroll stated he had no statement to make, or word to send anyone, and that his parents were dead.FBI Dillinger File, 62-29777, report by Agent R.C. Coulter Reporter Francis Veach, along with John Gwynne, the Black Hawk county attorney, and assistant county attorney Burr Towne, were admitted into Carroll's room at the St. Francis Hospital. Drs. Paul O'Keefe, Wade Preece, and J.R. O'Keefe were also at the bedside. Veach asked Carroll, who was now breathing heavily, if he had anything to say. \\"I'm hit, Buddy. That's all. I'm hit.\\" Veach also asked Carroll if he wanted a priest. Thanking him, Carroll said the priest had already been in his room. Veach left the hospital and went to the county jail to interview Jean Delaney. He asked her if she had a message to take back to Carroll. \\"Tell him that I said not to die and that they are going to let me see him in the hospital. Tell him that I love him. He was always good and kind to me, and the things they say about him aren't true. We just stopped in Waterloo to get my glasses fitted.\\" Veach told her he would deliver the message. When he arrived back at the hospital, he learned that Carroll had died just before he got there, about six p.m. He returned to the jail and told Delaney that her message had been delivered, \\"thinking it might soften the blow somewhat.\\"Waterloo Courier, \\"Gangster Found His Alley,\\" 6-2-74 Two days after Carroll's death Delaney was sentenced to a year and a day for violating her parole, and later miscarried their child. Carroll was given a Catholic funeral at the Church of the Assumption in St. Paul and was buried in Oakland Cemetery, St. Paul, Lot 279, Block 71. Carroll's grave marker has long been missing.Maccabee, John, \\"John Dillinger Slept Here,\\" p. 232 In other media Tommy Carroll is played by actor Spencer Garrett in the 2009 film Public Enemies. In the film he is shown being shot in the back of the head during a disastrous bank robbery in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and is then tortured by BOI agents attempting to gain information regarding the gang's hideout.

The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 58-59) Early life and criminal career Jim Clark was born in Mountainburg, Arkansas on February 26, 1902. In 1923, the 21-year-old Clark was arrested in Oklahoma and sent to the state reformatory in Granite. He was eventually released from the reformatory and drifted to Texas where he found work in the oil fields. By 1927, he had begun smuggling bootleg liquor across the border from Juarez, Mexico and was jailed for 30 days after a botched robbery that same year. Returning to Oklahoma, he was again arrested for burglary and sentenced to five years imprisonment on March 31, 1928. Clark was released after serving less than a year of his sentence and quickly returned to his criminal career. On March 14, 1932, he was sentenced to two years in prison for stealing a car in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma. Six weeks later, Clark officially became a fugitive when he walked off from the prison camp in Colby on April 25. His escape lasted only briefly however when he was arrested with Frank Sawyer and Ed Davis riding in a stolen car near Rich Hill, Missouri on June 17. Their arrest occurring hours after the robbery of $47,000 from a bank in Fort Scott, Kansas, in actuality having been committed by the Barker Gang, Clark and his two accomplices were wrongly convicted of the robbery and imprisoned at the state penitentiary at Lansing. Time with the Bailey- Underhill gang On May 30, 1933, Clark was one of 11 convicts who escaped with Underhill from Lansing using pistols smuggled inside the prison from friends. Authorities later believed Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash was responsible for having orchestrated the mass escape. Clark and another escapee, Clifford Dopson, became separated from the others shortly after their escape. They managed to hitch a ride on Route 66 with a young Joliet couple the next morning and, drawing their guns, took them hostage. They forced the couple, B.K. Blair and Alice Braithwaite, to drive until reaching Neosho, Missouri whereupon they released them and took over their car. During the ride, one of the convicts claimed they \\"had to kill a bull last night\\" which may have referred to the murder of World War I war hero police officer Otto Durkee in Chetopa, Kansas.Breuer, William B. J. Edgar Hoover and his G-Men. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. (pg. 52) ODMP memorial Clark spent the next several weeks on the run with Wilbur Underhill, Harvey Bailey and Robert \\"Big Bob\\" Brady, briefly hiding out in Cookson Hills, Oklahoma, before hitting their first bank together. On July 3, Clark and the others robbed $11,000 from a bank in Clinton, Oklahoma and then, seven weeks later, raided another bank in Kingfisher on August 7. Plans to rob another bank in Brainerd, Minnesota fell through when Bailey was arrested by federal agents three days later while visiting George \\"Machine Gun\\" Kelly's ranch in Paradise, Texas. Underhill also left around this time leaving Clark and Brady to continue on their own. Their last robbery together turned into a disaster when they attempted to hold up a bank in Frederick, Oklahoma on October 6, 1933. They escaped with only $5,000, missing $80,000 in the vault and the teller's cages, and took three hostages with them as they made their getaway. After switching cars in Indiahoma, they raced across Texas heading for New Mexico. When police discovered the first getaway car, police found a map charting their escape route and telephoned ahead to New Mexico authorities with a description of the fugitives. Clark and Brady were stopped near Tucumcari, New MexicoKing, Jeffrey. The Life and Death of Pretty Boy Floyd. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1999. (pg. 134) Bishop, Mark and Omus Sours. The Face of Death. Victoria, British Columbia: Trafford Publishing, 2003. (pg. 191) and, although Clark gave his name as \\"F.N. Atwood\\", authorities believed Clark was Wilbur Underhill before fingerprints established his identity. The charges against the two for their latest crime spree were waived as both men were returned to serve the rest of their sentence in Lansing. Partnership with Frank Delmar Clark and Brady were placed into solitary confinement upon their arrival in Lansing. Restrictions on their movements were gradually relaxed over the next three months and, on January 19, 1934, he and Brady took part in yet another prison break when they and five other inmates escaped from a kitchen work detail. Clark and Brady split up soon after they got on the outside, with Clark joining Frank Delmar in kidnapping schoolteacher Louis Dresser. The two drove his car to Oklahoma where they released their hostage once they met with Clark's girlfriend Goldie Johnson who was waited for them with a car. Dresser was apparently so upset by the incident that he mistakenly identified Johnson as Bonnie Parker. He and Demar soon began robbing banks in Kansas and Oklahoma. In one of their first robberies together, he and Delmar raided a bank in Goodland, Kansas for $2,000 on February 9. Clark was shot in both feet during their escape by a police officer shooting from underneath a nearby car. He spent the next three months recovering from his wounds and, on May 9, robbed a bank in Wetumka, Oklahoma for $500. On May 31, he returned with Delmar to the same bank in Kingfisher that he had robbed with Underhill, Bailey and Brady in August 1933. After robbing another bank in Crescent, Oklahoma on June 20, he revisited the same Clinton bank he had robbed with his old partners the previous year and stole $13,000. He and Goldie Johnson were also suspected of robbing a bank in Oxford, Kansas, but both denied this and no charges were ever filed. Capture and imprisonment By the summer of 1934, Clark had been declared a \\"public enemy\\" and Kansas governor personally offered a $200 reward for his capture as did the state banking association. A special police unit was established by Kansas authorities who finally tracked him down in Tulsa and arrested him on August 1. Clark was later tried and convicted on federal bank robbery charges and given a 99-year prison sentence. On January 14, 1935, Clark was sent to Leavenworth where he spent two years before his transfer to Alcatraz in 1937. Repeated disciplinary infractions forced his return to Leavenworth a year later where he reportedly assumed control of illegal gambling and loan shark for the next decade. His activities were eventually discovered by prison officials and Clark was sent back to Alcatraz in January 1948. He remained there for over twelve years until his eventual return to Leavenworth in 1960 and then to Seagoville, Texas nine years later. Release and later years After thirty-five years in prison, Clark was released on parole on December 9, 1969. The 67-year-old Clark returned to Oklahoma to marry the widow of his brother and where he would spend the rest of his life. He worked as a ranch hand for several years and, when old age prevented him continuing, Clark managed a commercial parking lot for a local bank until his death on June 9, 1974.

Largely active in the West Coast, they were one of the few groups to gain national attention outside the Midwest and also one of the last groups to be captured by the FBI at the end of the decade. Cretzer was killed in a failed attempt to escape Alcatraz resulting in the 1946 prison riot.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 67-68) History Originally formed by bank robbers Joseph \\"Dutch\\" Cretzer and Arnold Kyle, and later joined by regular members Milton Hartmann and John Oscar Hetzer, the gang's first recorded robbery was on January 31, 1935, when Cretzer, Kyle and Hartmann stole $3,396 from a bank in Portland, Oregon. At the end of the year, the three men struck again at a branch bank inside the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California on November 29 escaping with $2,765. On January 23, 1936, they stole $6,000 from a bank in Oakland and then returned to Los Angeles the next day to steal another $1,475. The gang remained in Los Angeles County for another six months robbing a number of banks, their biggest jobs netting them $6,100 on March 3 and $1,996 on July 1. However, one of their most successful robberies took them outside the Los Angeles-area when they stole $14,581 from a local bank in Seattle, Washington on July 27. Joseph Cretzer Soon after this robbery, the modus operandum of the gang changed as Cretzer, Kyle and Hartmann had all been identified by witnesses by this time as having participated in all the gang's robberies. Cretzer was reportedly absent when Kyle and Hartmann robbed $8,000 from another Seattle bank. Similarly, Cretzer was on his own when he walked out of a Los Angeles bank with $2,870 on January 28, 1937. John Hetzer made his first appearance with the gang during this time taking part in the robbery of a Portland bank with Kyle and Hartmann on March 29 which netted $18,195. This would be the gang's most successful bank job to date. Break-up of the Gang The authorities had begun to actively pursue the gang, the FBI by now focusing on criminal gangs outside the Midwest, and Hertzer was arrested by federal agents in a Los Angeles garage eight days after the robbery in Portland. The following day, the FBI raided the Stuart Hotel in Los Angeles but Hartmann committed suicide by shooting himself before agents entered his room. On January 25, 1936, Edna Cretzer was taken into custody and charged with running a brothel in Pittsburg, California, however she quickly posted bail whilst her husband Joseph remained a fugitive. Cretzer and Kyle made one last attempt by fleeing to the Midwest where, only a few years before, so many outlaws such as John Dillinger and the Karpis-Barker Gang had success. The law finally caught up to Arnold Kyle when, on May 18, 1939, he was arrested in Minneapolis, Minnesota for drunk driving. He claimed his name was Raymond Palmer, but fingerprints confirmed his identity and he was turned over to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to federal bank robbery charges and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment at McNeil Island, ironically near the area where he robbed his first banks. Cretzer was apprehended two months later when the FBI caught up to him in Chicago, Illinois on August 27. On November 7, his wife Edna, sister of Arnold Kyle, pleaded guilty to harboring her husband and Cretzer himself confessed to one of the robberies in Los Angeles on January 24, 1940, and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Cretzer was also incarcerated at McNeil's Island and reunited with his old partner and brother-in-law. Together they hijacked a prison lorry in an attempt to escape but were both recaptured after three days hiding in the woods . During their trial for attempted escape, Cretzer with Kyle, made another escape attempt by assaulting U.S. Marshal A.J. Chitty but both were caught before they could flee the courthouse. Chitty died from heart attack as a result of his injuries, and both were sentenced to life imprisonment . Cretzer and Kyle were transferred to Alcatraz after this incident. Cretzer and Kyle made another failed attempt to escape from Alcatraz in 1941 and in 1946 Cretzer died during yet another escape attempt, the so-called Battle of Alcatraz. Kyle served time in various prisons before being paroled in August 1963. He died in Lynnwood, Washington on November 30, 1980.

UKTV joined Thinkbox in January 2011. Thinkbox was launched in February 2005 with a consortium consisting of eight companies, and was initially run as a virtual organisation. In 2006 the group changed direction, hiring Tess Alps as the CEO and undergoing significant internal changes, including the loss of one of the original eight companies involved in creating the organisation. Five left the organisation at the end of 2010. Thinkbox's activities include supporting research into aspects of marketing using television, supporting various television marketing awards (including their regular Thinkboxes), running a series of events and training programs, and providing information to marketers about television advertising. History Thinkbox was founded in February 2005, by a consortium of eight media companies: Channel 4, Five, GMTV, Sky Media, IDS, ITV, Turner Media Innovations, Viacom Brand Solutions. Thinkbox's budget was set by charging a flat fee to each of the eight member organisations and an additional variable rate tied to their share of the TV advertising market, the new body was developed to improve sales of television advertising. Nevertheless, the member organisations were expected to continue to compete for advertising, and they retained their existing sales departments. Structurally, Thinkbox began as a virtual organisation, lacking both a dedicated executive body and physical headquarters. Instead of a dedicated executive, the staff working on the project were overseen by a committee consisting of representatives of each of the eight member organisations, and Thinkbox was initially chaired by ITV's Justin Sampson. However, this structure – particularly the lack of an executive body – was met with a degree of criticism from both inside and outside the organisation. Things changed in 2006. Following Samson's departure from ITV, the role of chair was passed to Channel 4's Andy Barnes and Tess Alps was appointed as the chief executive officer in April of that year. In particular, the appointment of Alps was seen as a positive move by industry commentators: her experience with PHD suggested that she would already be aware of the various personalities and agendas in play, which was highly relevant given the \\"varying agendas\\" of the member organisations and the potential for dissent. Some of this potential for dissent was realised later that year, when, in August 2006, IDS left the consortium. In a statement after its departure, IDS accused Thinkbox of giving in to ITV demands, moving away from a one-member, one-vote model to one which provided greater weight to ITV. (Under the new structure, ITV had gained additional voting power and a veto). Shortly after the departure of IDS, the remaining seven organisations increased the funding being provided to Thinkbox – although the exact figure was not available at the time, it was said to be \\"substantially bigger\\" that the £3m which the organisation had been operating with prior to the increase. In spite of rumours in the first half of 2007 that ITV were considering removing their support from Thinkbox, the remaining seven companies have continued to be a part of the organisation. Since the beginning of 2007 Thinkbox established permanent staff and hired Red Brick Road and MediaCom to handle advertising, media buying and strategic consultancy, and they released their first television advertisements. They also inaugurated the annual TV Planning Awards and the monthly Thinkboxes, ran the second of their Thinkbox Experience conferences, as well as the major Televisionaries conference in 2008. http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/analysis/866008/ In February 2011, Lindsey Clay became Thinkbox's first managing director having previously been the organisation's Marketing Director. In May 2012 Thinkbox announced that Tess Alps would become its Executive Chair and that the Chair of the Thinkbox board would pass to a different shareholder director every year. Julia Jordan, Executive Director, Business & Operations, at UKTV, become Chair of the Thinkbox board. Activities Research Thinkbox develops research focused on issues surrounding television advertising. Research studies include: a joint study with the Internet Advertising Bureau (UK) looking at how TV and online advertising work together; an in-depth analysis of how TV sponsorship works; an engagement study examining how consumers engage with TV ads; two \\"payback\\" studies with PricewaterhouseCoopers examining the impact of TV advertising on long- and short-term sales and brand equity; a study into \\"Generation Whatever\\", looking at the lives of young people and their media consumption; an analysis of attitudes towards online TV and how it works with established broadcast TV.; a study with Mediacom examining the impact of television on immediate web response and other short-term response channels; a joint study with the IPA which analysed the correlation between campaigns' performance across a wide range of the world's most respected creative awards determined by The Gunn Report, and their performance in hard business terms recorded in the IPA Effectiveness Awards Databank between 2000 and 2008; a 'TV Together' study that explored the shared viewing experience and the phenomenon of social networking in relation to TV; and a 'Tellyporting' study with Decipher, which involved equipping families with the latest TV technologies to study their impact on TV viewing behaviour. Awards In 2007 Thinkbox, in combination with Campaign and MediaWeek, announced the formation of the TV Planning Awards. The awards were first granted in 2008. In addition, monthly awards, called the Thinkboxes, were inaugurated in May 2008. Working in conjunction with Haymarket Brand Media, the awards are judged by a \\"Thinkbox Creative Academy\\" consisting of approximately 100 representatives of the marketing and advertising industries, and are focused on awarding creativity in regard to television advertising. Thinkbox is involved sponsoring a number of different industry awards, including the IPA Effectiveness Awards, ISBA, The British Arrows. Advertising and publishing Initially campaign development was handled in-house, but in 2007 Thinkbox decided to engage an outside agency. The result was the hiring of Red Brick Road, who were engaged to handle Thinkbox's advertising, online and direct marketing requirements. In 2008 Thinkbox went further, hiring MediaCom to handle their media buying and planning, as well as to provide strategic advice. Under this new approach, Thinkbox's first television advertising campaign – which went on to be awarded by D&AD;, the BTAAs, and the APA – was launched in May 2009, with a roadblock advertisement presented across multiple channels. Thinkbox's 2010 advertising campaign \\"Every home needs a Harvey\\". In September 2010 Thinkbox launched its second TV advertising campaign, featuring a couple visiting a dogs' home to choose a dog to adopt.Mark Sweney, The Guardian, 9 September 2010 http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/09/dog-thinkbox-tv-advertising They encounter a dog called Harvey, played by Sykes, who has made a TV ad. Harvey turns on a TV behind him which plays out an ad showcasing his amazing skills such as playing chess, doing the school run, cooking, ironing, and cleaning windows. Harvey's ad ends with the line 'Every home needs a Harvey'. The soundtrack to the ad is Bachman-Turner Overdrive's 1974 classic You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet. The ad ends with the lines 'Discover the power of TV advertising at www.thinkbox.tv' and 'Television: where brands get their breaks’. The ad featuring Harvey the dog was voted Ad of the Year by ITV viewers in December 2010. In May 2012 Thinkbox launched a second TV campaign featuring Harvey the dog. In this new ad, Harvey used emotional story-telling to change his owner's behaviour dramatically and persuade him not to throw away his best friend and constant companion, a stuffed toy called Rabbit. It opens at the moment that Harvey’s owner is about to put the well-worn, slobber-covered Rabbit in the bin while Harvey is apparently not around. Harvey suddenly appears and plays a TV ad telling the story of how he and Rabbit became friends and the scrapes they’ve got into together over the years. The organisation's first website was launched in May 2005, and was intended to be used to provide industry data, research findings, and case studies. The site was relaunched a year later, and, after an investment of £250,000, it had been modified to include new features such as television advertisements and industry directories. In 2008 they engaged in another revamp, redesigning the site so that the focus could be extended, incorporating content regarding some of the newer technologies such as IPTV, and providing greater access to their research and materials. Since the most recent revamp Thinkbox have continued to develop their website, adding features such as an online calculator that advertisers could use to predict the cost of interactive TV ads. Thinkbox's content team produce films on TV and TV advertising, many of which can be watched on its website. Training Thinkbox hosts events on TV advertising featuring well-known industry figures. Thinkbox's planning team runs a series of training courses. The courses are aimed primarily at people who have recently joined a media agency, advertising agency or advertiser but are also available to new starters at broadcasters or sales houses. Events The first major event funded by Thinkbox was the 2005 \\"Thinkbox Experience\\" – a short conference that was attended by approximately 600 delegates and which was generally well received by the industry. A second Thinkbox Experience was not held in 2006, as the organisation decided to direct their efforts towards research that year. As a result, the next conference was held in 2007. Thinkbox hosts a rolling programme of events designed to help people understand how to get the best of TV. The events are often held to launch new Thinkbox research. Recent events include 'Screen Life: TV in Demand', 'TV Nation', 'POETIC: connecting paid, owned and earned media', 'TV Creativity: the art of the heart', and 'Advertising Effectiveness: the long and short of it' References External links *Thinkbox – official website.

Tenney (1898 – November 4, 1970) was an American politician who was noted for leading anti-communist investigations in California in the 1940s and early 1950s as head of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un- American Activities (\\"Tenney Committee\\"); earlier, he was a song-composer, best known for \\"Mexicali Rose\\". Background Jack B. Tenney was born in 1898 in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to California in 1909. After serving in the Army during World War I, he worked his way through law school. Career While a young attorney, he turned to songwriting and wrote such songs as \\"Mexicali Rose\\" and \\"On the Banks of the Old Merced\\". (fee for article) California State Assembly Tenney ran for the California State Assembly as a Democrat in 1936 and won. In 1940, he also served as one of California's electors, casting his vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1942, Tenney ran for the State Senate as a Republican, and served three four-year terms there. Tenney Committee Actor Edward G. Robinson (1948) came under the scrutiny of the \\"Tenney Committee\\" (California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un- American Activities) during the 1940s Tenney made his name in the State Senate as a foe of Communism, and was chair of the California Committee on Un- American Activities from 1941 to 1949.Barrett, Edward L. jr.

Cornell University Press - Studies in Civil Liberties. 1951 He stated, \\"You can no more coexist with communism than you can coexist with a nest of rattlesnakes.\\" As the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities, which investigated alleged communists in California, Tenney \\"vigorously attacked everyone he believed to be a Communist or to have Communist sympathies\\". Those investigated by Tenney's committee included: * Paul Robeson: Singer, actor and activist Duberman, Martin.

According to historians Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund, \\"In actuality, the strike had resulted from Disney's overbearing paternalism, high-handedness, and insensitivity.\\" Inspired by Disney, California State Senator Tenney, chairman of the state legislature's California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities, launched an investigation of \\"Reds in movies\\". The probe fell flat, and was mocked in several Variety headlines. Book banning In 1941, John D. Henderson, President of the California Library Association (CLA), predicted that in the 1940s librarians would experience a \\"war on books and ideas.\\" In response to this climate, CLA formed a \\"Committee on Intellectual Freedom to Safeguard the Rights of Library Users to Freedom of Inquiry.\\" At the same time, State Senator Tenney was appointed the chair of a legislative Fact-Finding Committee on Un American Activities in California, which was charged with investigating \\"all facts ... rendering the people of the State ... less fit physically, mentally, morally, economically, or socially.\\" The Tenney Committee began to investigate any textbooks associated with suspected subversives, such as Carey McWilliams or Langston Hughes. A multi-volume series of textbooks called the Building America Series, which had been used in classrooms for over a decade, came under the scrutiny of Tenney's Committee. Committee member Richard E. Combs argued that the series put \\"undue emphasis on slums, discrimination, unfair labor practices, ... and a great many other elements that comprise the seedy side of life.\\" Miriam Matthews wrote an article detailing CLA's work fighting censorship for the American Library Association's Library Journal in which she argued that, if successful, the Tenney Committee's legislative efforts would \\"prohibit instruction in controversial subjects.\\" Zoot Suit Riots Young teenagers wearing zoot suits during Zoot Suit Riots (1942) On June 21, 1943, the State Un-American Activities Committee, under state senator Tenney, arrived in Los Angeles with orders to \\"determine whether the present Zoot Suit Riots were sponsored by Nazi agencies attempting to spread disunity between the United States and Latin-American countries.\\" Although Tenney claimed he had evidence the riots were \\"[A]xis-sponsored\\", no evidence was ever presented to support this claim. Japanese propaganda broadcasts accused the U.S. government of ignoring the brutality of U.S. Marines toward Mexicans. In late 1944, ignoring the findings of the McGucken committee and the unanimous reversal of the convictions by the appeals court in the Sleepy Lagoon case on October 4, the Tenney Committee announced that the National Lawyers Guild was an \\"effective communist front.\\" Loyalty oath Tenney was instrumental in forcing the University of California to implement loyalty oaths on its faculty when he introduced legislation requiring such oaths. In 1949, as the head of the Un-American Activities, Tenney drafted legislation that would introduce a constitutional amendment to be placed on the state ballot that would give the state legislature authority over the university in matters of loyalty. Tenney's Senate Bill 130 would have forbidden the teaching of un-American subjects in the public schools of California, which would be required to teach \\"Americanism.\\" The University's representative at the legislature, Controller James H. Corley, who served as the University's chief lobbyist, was alarmed as he felt that Tenney represented a political movement that was bound to succeed. After Corley consulted with Tenney, the loyalty oath program was implemented without recourse to the ballot, apparently without consulting with University chancellor Robert Gordon Sproul. Ironically, Corley overestimated Tenney's power. He was ousted as the chair of the Un-American Activities Committee that year. In 1950, Sproul supported passage of a similar Levering Act. Campaigns Tenney ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1944 and in 1949, the year he was removed from the chairmanship of his committee. He ran in the 1949 Los Angeles mayoral election, placing fifth. The conduct of the hearings, by a later account, \\"egregiously violated due process\\"Embattled Dreams: California in War and Peace, 1940-1950 By Kevin Starr, page 307 and of the hundreds of people subpoenaed and interrogated in its eight years, not a single one had been indicted, much less convicted, of any sort of subversion. America First Party: anti-Semitism In 1952, Tenney ran with Douglas MacArthur, here speaking at Soldier Field in Chicago (1951) In 1952, Tenney sought to move to the United States House of Representatives, accepting the help of anti-Semite Gerald L. K. Smith of the America First Party. Tenney lost to Joseph F. Holt, who won the general election. Tenney also produced a number of anti-semitic books, one called Anti-Gentile Activity in America,American prophet: the life & work of Carey McWilliams By Peter Richardson page 131 another called Zionist Network from 1953.Catalog of Copyright Entries. Third Series: 1953: July–December By Library of Congress. Copyright Office, page 632 Tenney ran for Vice President on the 1952 Christian National Party ticket headed by Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur had been \\"drafted\\" by the CNP (as well as the America First Party) without his consent. The CNP ticket gained few votes. In 1954, the head of the state Republican committee pointed to this race as a reason to oppose Tenney for renomination. In an April 1954 debate with Mildred Younger, who was challenging him for the Republican nomination for th 38th Senate District (which comprised Los Angeles County), Tenney denied under direct questioning from Younger that he had any knowledge of Gerald L.K. Smith, despite his having run as Vice President for Smith's party and for having appeared on the cover of Smith's The Cross and the Flag the month before the debate. Younger beat Tenney but lost the general election to the Democratic candidate. The New York Times saw his defeat as part of the ending for McCarthyism. (fee for article) Tenney moved to Banning, California, in 1959, and worked as a part-time city attorney in nearby Cabazon, California. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1962.  Personal life  In 1921 Tenney married Florence. They have two daughters. In 1945, Tenney and Florence Tenney were divorced. Tenney's daughters are Leila Florence Donegan, former mayor of Monterey Park, California and Virginia Woodward.

Like Berceni, Giurgiului has plenty of 10-storey blocks of flats that were built under Communist rule starting with 1959-1964. The estimated population is between 30,000 and 40,000. Before the Communists started their massive building programme, Giurgiului was a farming village. After 1948 the village was added to the city area. A few years later in the south of the neighborhood a pipe factory was built along with a power plant, CET Berceni. Giurgiului has a cemetery, which includes a memorial to an estimated 300 Jewish refugees who had sailed from Romania aboard the motor schooner and were killed when a Soviet submarine sank the ship in August 1944. History As mentioned before, the area was at first placed on the road towards the town of Giurgiu, the namesake of the neighborhood. The area was made up of small farms, agricultural fields and houses. The communist government insisted on a modernization programme of the area, using the sparsely-populated areas of Bucharest (including Berceni) to build modern apartment buildings. The North- South trunk route plan involved building in the South section of this route a number of apartment buildings. Thus, the beginnings of the current Giurgiului housing estate are listed below: *1958: The housing buildings of the IDEB workers and the construction site workers are completed, they are located near the Jewish Cemetery. *1959: The construction work for the 5-staircase apartment blocks begins and the Progresul market is included in this programme as well, being completed by late 1960-early 1961. *1962: The construction work for another row of 5-staircase apartment blocks begins as well, by this time, the construction work for the last of the apartment blocks that began construction in 1959 is finished. *1963: The construction work for the 11-storey tower blocks, apartment blocks with 5 to 6 staircases and 7-storey apartment blocks begins. *1968: By around this time, all the construction work for the original apartment buildings in the original modernization programme is finished. *1971: In the nearby Berceni housing estate, the construction work for the prefabricated 4-storey buildings begins. *1972: The construction work for the prefabricated 10-storey apartment buildings (in 2 to 5 staircases) commences. *1977: Further southwards, where the IDEB housing buildings are located, the construction of large 10-storey apartment buildings with 4 to 7 staircases commences. They are struck by the Vrancea earthquake, which forces the authorities to close the construction sites temporarily, in order to seismically retrofit them, along with other buildings in the neighborhood. Upon the completion of the first buildings, people left homeless by the quake are moved to these apartment blocks, a move that will span up to early 1978. *1979: The construction site for all these previously mentioned buildings is finished. *1986: The construction work for a group of prefabricated 8-storey apartment buildings begins, situated further northwards near the Pieptănari metro station. *1989: By the December 1989 revolution, most of these 8-storey buildings are finished, although a couple of them are still not done. *1990: After the completion of the last 8-storey buildings, all the construction sites in the Giurgiului housing estate are closed. Newly- completed apartment buildings in 1964 From an architectural point of view, the buildings are standardized, but especially on the 1960s buildings, there is a noticeable Western Modernist influence, typical of Romanian housing estates built in that era. The neighborhood was also designed to feature a lot of space for greenery, and the buildings are laid out in such a way that the centerpiece of the housing estate is the tower block near Toporași, one of the few tower blocks built in the respective era. The planners responsible for the construction of the housing estate were Mircea Bercovici, Constantin Gherghiceanu and Cleopatra Alifanti. Transport The neighborhood has a good transport network, although it is not fully serviced by the Bucharest Metro, with the nearest station being Eroii Revoluției. STB tram routes 7 and 25 link Giurgiului with the city centre, and route 19 links it to the Titan housing estate. STB bus routes 102, 116 and 323 link the neighborhood with other parts of Bucharest. Giurgiului has a CFR railway station on the line linking Bucharest with the Danube port of Giurgiu, further south towards Jilava, however it is currently closed to normal operation. The Giurgiului Road that passes through the middle of the neighbourhood is an important route to Giurgiu and Bulgaria.

On October 14, 1926, he and seven others armed with submachine guns hijacked a U.S. mail truck in Elizabeth, New Jersey and escaped with $161,000. During the gunbattle with the guards, the driver was killed while his assistant and a local police officer were wounded.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers.

The robbery received considerable coverage at the time and is regarded as one of the most high- profile robberies prior to the \\"Public Enemy\\"-era of the 1930s. Three days after the robbery, after a two-day discussion with his cabinet, then President Calvin Coolidge assigned 2,250 U.S. Marines to escort all mail shipments in the Eastern United States. A further announcement on October 27 authorized the use of 250 Thompson machine guns specifically to be used for guard duty. Already a long-favored weapon in the underworld, the Marine Corps was the first branch of the U.S. military to purchase \\"Tommy guns\\". Weeks after the robbery, Cunniffe was killed in a fight with fellow gang member William \\"Ice Wagon\\" Crowley when Crowley shot and killed both Cunniffe and his girlfriend at the Highland Court Apartments in Highland Park, Michigan on October 31, 1926. Crowley was still in the apartment when police were called because of the gunshots. Officers Ernest Jones and Ephraim Rancour arrived and a shootout occurred. Jones was immediately shot and killed when Crowley opened the door and Rancour was shot in the shoulder. Enraged that his partner had been killed in front of him and wounded himself, Rancour shot Crowley dead.

He was sentenced to three years for grand larceny at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary;Mooney, Martin. The Parole Scandal. Los Angeles: Lymanhouse, 1939. (pg. 291) his crime was stealing a pair of shoes. Davis was an early member of the Oklahoma-based \\"Central Park Gang\\" during the 1920s, where he first met the Barker Gang, and committed his first major robbery with Arthur \\"Doc\\" Barker when they burglarized St. John's Hospital in Tulsa. The night watchman, Thomas J. Sherrill, was killed during the robbery. Barker was arrested about 5 months later for the murder; however, Davis evaded authorities for nearly a year before he was captured. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the robbery.Toland, John. The Dillinger Days. New York: Da Capo Press, 1995. (pg. 45) In February 1923 (or January 1925), he briefly escaped from the state penitentiary in McAlester, participating in a mass escape with several other convicts by using ropes and a ladder to climb over the wall, but was recaptured almost two weeks later.Ward, David. Alcatraz: The Gangster Years. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009. (pg. 92-93) Seven years later, Davis applied for a 20-month \\"leave of absence\\" from the prison which was granted on November 3, 1932. Such leniency was common in Oklahoma during that time, even with such a criminal record as his, although Alvin Karpis later claimed that the state's decision was influenced by a $1,500 bribe. He was scheduled to return to the prison on July 1, 1934, but Davis went on the run instead. A month after his release, he reunited with girlfriend Edna Murray, who herself had escaped from prison for a third time. The couple joined the Alvin Karpis-Barker Gang who were then at the peak of their success and in the midst of a major crime spree. Davis and Murray were later implicated in the kidnapping of St. Paul banker Edward BremerPotter, Claire Bond. War on Crime: Bandits, G-Men, and the Politics of Mass Culture.

They had brought John \\"Red\\" Hamilton, who had been mortally wounded days earlier in a running gunfight in Minnesota hours after their escape from Little Bohemia Lodge. Davis agreed to hide Hamilton in his home and, with Murray, looked after him until he died of his wounds a few days later.Matera, Dary. John Dillinger: The Life and Death of America's First Celebrity Criminal. New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005. (pg. 283) Dillinger, Dock Barker, Van Meter, and Davis later buried Hamilton in an unmarked grave. Davis and Murray were never charged with the holdups he committed while part of the Karpis-Barker Gang. However, they were indicted for the Bremer kidnapping on January 22, 1935. A little over two weeks later, Davis was captured in St. Louis by federal agents on February 6 but escaped from federal custody the next day. He had been traveling under escort to stand trial in St. Paul when their plane was forced to land in Yorkville, Illinois. Once on the ground, Davis knocked out a guard and stole a car. He evaded capture for nearly four months before being traced to Chicago by the FBI and arrested by Agent Melvin Purvis on June 1. He was eventually returned to St. Paul where he was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment. Davis cooperated with the government and gave information as well as testified against other members of the gang. Like the rest of the Karpis-Barker Gang, Davis was sent to Alcatraz, where he spent the next several decades. He did not participate in the escape attempt organized by Arthur Barker in 1939. There are claims that he became involved in a violent fistfight with Karpis, which he won. By the time of his release in the late 1950s, however, he was in poor health. Davis married Daisy Irene Graham on May 21, 1960, in Contra Costa County, California, and resided in Guerneville, California. He died on July 20, 1979, in Sonoma County, California.

Police later suspected that Harvey Bailey, who had worked with Trainor in the past, may have been another member of the gang but were never able to produce any evidence of his involvement. On February 17, a month after Trainor's body was discovered, Minnesota authorities raided an abandoned hideout and the Secret Service recovered $80,000 from the Denver Mint Robbery and $73,000 in bonds stolen from a bank robbery in Walnut Hills, Ohio three months prior to the mint robbery. Both Trainor and Bailey were suspects in the Walnut Hills robbery which further strengthened the police theory of Bailey's involvement. Bailey had disappeared in late-1922 and continued to elude authorities until his arrest and conviction in 1933. {Died 1979} The case remained unsolved for 12 years until Denver Police Chief A.T.

He was connected to several Midwestern gangs during the 1920s and 1930s, most often with the Barker-Alvin Karpis and Holden-Keating Gangs, and was also a former partner of Harvey Bailey early in his criminal career.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 81) DeVol is known to have killed at least eleven people during his criminal career, including six law enforcement officers. Early life Lawrence DeVol was born in Belpre, Ohio on 17 November 1903 to parents Helem and Emma (Shanks) DeVol. He moved with his parents and brother Albert to Oklahoma as a child, being raised in the Tulsa area. Lawrence's mother would later marry a second time, to William Keener, but it is unclear whether it was a circumstance of divorce or being widowed. Criminal career On 20 May 1914 Lawrence DeVol was sentenced to the Oklahoma State Training School for White Boys as an incorrigible youth. After serving a short term, he soon became involved in theft and other criminal activity and, as a member of the Tulsa \\"Central Park Gang\\", he was first arrested for larceny at age 13. DeVol participated in his first bank robbery on 19 August 1927, when he joined Eddie Fitzgerald, Harry Morris and Harvey Bailey in stealing $70,000 from a bank in Vinton, Iowa. He joined the group in a second robbery, which included Al Johnson, stole $225,000 from a bank in Washington Court House, Ohio on 6 February 1928. DeVol was convicted that same year in connection with a bank robbery in Kansas and sent to the state reformatory in Hutchinson. During his incarceration, he was befriended by Alvin Karpis. The pair escaped from the facility on 9 March 1929, and reached Pueblo, Colorado where they stole a car and headed south. They stopped in Woodward, Oklahoma where they attempted to burglarize a store but DeVol was caught, arrested and returned to Hutchinson. In spite of his escape attempt, DeVol was paroled by the end of the year and rejoined his old partner in a string of robberies throughout Kansas and Oklahoma. They were eventually arrested in Kansas City, Kansas on 23 March 1930, with DeVol posting $1,000 bail on April 1 and abandoning Karpis by leaving town. Cop killer As a fugitive, DeVol became increasingly hardened and violent during his years on the run. In April 1930, he and Jimmie Creighton were the prime suspects in the robbery and murder of two businessmen at the Hotel Severs in Muskogee, Oklahoma. On 25 June 1930 of that year, he committed his first known murder when he shot and killed two police officers, Sheriff William Sweet and City Marshal Aaron Bailey, in Washington, Iowa. Less than three months later, he reunited with Harvey Bailey to rob $40,000 from a bank in Ottumwa, Iowa as part of a team which included Thomas Holden and Francis Keating, Vernon Miller and Frank Nash. On the night of 16 November 1930, DeVol single-handedly robbed the Orpheum Theater in Hannibal, Missouri. Around five a.m. the next morning he engaged in a shootout with two police officers in Kirksville, Missouri, killing one and wounding the second. A group of citizens had earlier that morning observed DeVol acting suspiciously around one of the towns movie theaters and alerted authorities. Officers George Scriven and John Rose approached DeVol's vehicle at a gas station and asked him to exit the car. He did so, with a gun in each hand and opened fire. Rose was killed instantly while the wounded Officer Scriven returned fire but missed as DeVol fled on foot. Investigators searching the car found a pair of shotguns plus money and checks from the earlier Hannibal robbery. After the murder in Kirksville, DeVol disappeared for over a year before turning up in St. Paul, Minnesota around Christmas, 1931, where he joined the Barker Gang. His first known robbery with the gang was on 29 March 1932, when he joined Fred Barker, Alvin Karpis, Thomas Holden and Bernard Phillips in stealing $226,500 in cash and securities from a bank in Minneapolis. On 17 June, DeVol was part of an eight-man team including Fred Barker, Alvin Karpis, Thomas Holden, Francis Keating, Harvey Bailey, Vern Miller and Frank Nash which robbed $47,000 from a bank in Fort Scott, Kansas. The next robbery earned even more when he and Fred Barker, Karpis, Jess Doyle and Earl Christman stole $250,000 in cash and bonds from a bank in Concordia, Kansas on 25 July. While this was possibly the most successful heist he had been involved in, his next bank job in Wahpeton, North Dakota netted only $6,900. His accomplices were Doyle, Karpis and Fred and Arthur Barker. He returned with the gang to Minneapolis at the end of the year, where along with seven other men, including Bill Weaver, Doyle, Verne Miller, Karpis and the Barker brothers held up a bank for $22,000 in cash and another $92,000 in bonds on December 16. The robbery turned violent as DeVol killed Patrolmen Ira Evans and Leo Gorski outside the bank. Fred Barker also killed an innocent bystander when the gang were switching getaway cars in St. Paul. DeVol was arrested in St. Paul days after the robbery, either on 18 or 21 December 1932. He had been behaving in a drunk and disorderly manner. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was first sent to the state prison in Stillwater, Minnesota but later transferred to the St. Peter Hospital for the Criminally Insane. He escaped from there in a mass breakout, along with fifteen other inmates on 6 June 1936. Final crime and death On 8 July 1936, DeVol robbed a bank with Don Reeder, a fellow escapee from St. Peter Hospital, in Turon, Kansas. He then fled to Enid, Oklahoma. The owner of the German Village Tavern, a former Enid law enforcement officer, alerted authorities that he feared a robbery was imminent, because of the behavior of a small group of strangers in the establishment.\\"Karpis Mobster Killed at Enid\\", Lawrence Journal World, July 9, 1936 Police arrived and when asked to come with them for questioning DeVol responded \\"Let me finish drinking my beer\\", after which he emptied the mug with one hand while pulling a gun with the other and opening fire with a .38 caliber pistol. Patrolman Cal Palmer was killed instantly while fellow lawman Ralph Knarr received serious wounds.http://www.odmp.org/officer/10329-police-officer-cal-palmer DeVol fled the tavern on foot and jumped on the running board of a passing vehicle two blocks later, telling the driver he was a Deputy Sheriff.

Early and family life He was born as one of the four sons of Sir Syed Wazir Hasan at Kalanpur, Jaunpur. The family belonged to the Shia sect of Islam. Career Zaheer began his career as a barrister in the Chiefs Court of Oudh (Awadh), based in Lucknow. He took interest in politics at an early age and joined the Indian National Congress. He selected Congress as they were leading India's struggle for independence from Britain. Municipal politics In the 1930s and 1940s, actively encouraged by the policy of Divide and Rule, communalism was at its peak in India. Awadh, dominated by vastly rich Muslim landlords ruling an overwhelmingly Hindu peasantry, had become a hotbed of Muslim separatism, and indeed the main source of funding for the Muslim League, which wanted to partition India and create Pakistan. Since many of the land-owners of the region were Muslims, much of provincial politics in Awadh during the days of the British Raj was dominated by them. Lucknow's was represented by the political rivalry between Chaudhry Khaliq-uz-zaman, a Sunni Muslim League leader, and Syed Ali Zaheer, a Shia Leader and a member of the Congress. Both fought elections for the Lucknow Municipal Board and the Congress won. Zaheer thus became Municipal Commissioner of Lucknow in the early 1940s. Later career Since he held an important position as a member of the Congress party, Zaheer refused to jump ship and join the Muslim League as many of his colleagues did. He was rewarded for this expedient loyalty in 1946 with the talks of independence beginning in right ernest. When the provisional government of India was formed, in 1946, as a prelude to independence, Zaheer was appointed Law Minister. Later, he was appointed as India's ambassador to Iran, again by Jawaharlal Nehru. After his return, he resumed his legal practice. Later, he became the Law Minister of Uttar Pradesh for two terms and also the Chairman of Uttar Pradesh Pay Commission. Though he was a lifelong Congressman Zaheer briefly left the Congress during the general elections of 1977 and joined Babu Jagjivan Ram's Congress for Democracy (CFD). He remained the president of the Shia Degree College Management Committee and was succeeded by his son Kazim Zaheer to that post. Syed Ali Zaheer was buried in Daliganj Karbala, which is close to the Shia College there.

He is credited as the first man to kill a federal agent and was the subject of an intense manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Personally led by J. Edgar Hoover, then recently appointed Director of the FBI, it was one of the first major investigations by the agency, who were led by Durkin on a three- month chase through five states before his capture in 1926.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 91-92) Biography In late 1925, Durkin came under investigation by federal authorities for violation of the Dyer Act. A professional car thief, the 25-year-old was suspected of transporting stolen cars across state lines. On October 11, 1925, Durkin was followed to a Chicago garage by federal Special Agent Edwin C. Shanahan. When Shanahan approached the car Durkin was in he surprised him and Durkin shot him in the chest. The story received instant national attention because Shanahan was the first federal agent to be killed in the line of duty . The reaction from the FBI was particularly aggressive and widely considered \\"a matter of pride and personal security\\" among virtually the entire agency. According to popular lore, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called an aide to his office after hearing news of Shanahan's death and said \\"We've got to get Durkin. If one man from the Bureau is killed, and the killer is permitted to get away, our agents will never be safe. We can't let him get away with it.\\" Hoover authorized one of the first and largest manhunts in the FBI's history, which stretched across the country and included several major cities. Durkin did not immediately flee Chicago and remained in the city until eventually traveling to California. Federal agents followed him to California, where he was involved in a San Diego car theft, and then to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. In El Paso, Durkin was stopped by a local sheriff who noticed Durkin carrying a pistol. He was then traveling with his girlfriend in a stolen Cadillac but falsely claimed that he was a deputy sheriff from California and was passing through on vacation. The sheriff allowed Durkin to retrieve his police identification from a nearby hotel but they instead took the opportunity to escape by driving into the Texas desert. The FBI soon arrived in El Paso, shortly after Durkin's abandoned car was found wrecked and partially buried in mesquite. Investigators found a rancher who recalled a man and woman who had shown up at his home and asked for a lift to the nearest town. He agreed to drive them to Girvin and remembered overhearing a conversation the couple had which suggested they planned to catch a train in Alpine, Texas, the seat in Brewster County. Although only 50 miles away from the Mexican border, authorities believed that Durkin would remain in the United States and most likely arrange travel to a large metropolitan area. A railroad ticket agent in Alpine identified Durkin as the man who had bought railroad tickets from him to San Antonio and from there to St. Louis. Durkin had already boarded a train to St. Louis on January 20, 1926, and was scheduled to arrive in the city at 11:00 am that same day. Investigators immediately phoned the FBI office in Missouri to intercept him and, cooperating with St. Louis police, had the train stopped at a small town just outside the St. Louis city limits. With the station surrounded on all sides by open farmland, there was little chance for Durkin to escape, and the train was boarded by federal agents and police officers, who arrested the fugitive in his private compartment before he could reach for his guns. Durkin confessed to the murder of Shanahan once in custody but, as killing a FBI agent was not yet a federal crime, he was tried and convicted by the state of Illinois for murder and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment. Durkin was then tried in federal court, where he received 15 additional years for violations of the Dyer Act, but they were unable to prosecute him for the murder of Shanahan. Durkin spent almost 20 years at the Illinois state prison and, after his release on August 8, 1945, he was transferred to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary where he remained until his parole on July 28, 1954. Durkin died in 1981.

He was born in Odda as a son of Guttorm Mork (1897–1974) and Inga Skadsem (1894–1950). He took the examen artium in 1948 and graduated with the cand.med. degree from the University of Bergen in 1954. After working as a physician in Arendal, Herdla and Haukeland, he got a World Health Organization scholarship to study at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1960 he took the PhD degree there with the thesis A Comparative Study of Respiratory Diseases in England, Wales and Norway. In 1960 he was hired in the Cancer Registry of Norway. He was promoted to assisting chief physician in 1966. He left the Cancer Registry in 1971 to become State Secretary in the Ministry of Social Affairs. He represented the Labour Party, and had been a municipal councilman in Asker from 1968 to 1975. Reportedly, he was appointed because the Minister of Social Affairs, Odd Højdahl, had his strengths in general administration, and was lacking in knowledge about social policy. Mork was only State Secretary until 1972, as the first cabinet Bratteli fell. In 1972, however, he was appointed as director of the Norwegian Directorate for Health, succeeding the legendary Karl Evang. Evang himself had made a halfhearted attempt to promote Jon Bjørnsson as successor. Besides Mork, the only likely candidate was Gudmund Harlem.Nordby, 1989: p. 267 Norway went through many reforms during his time as health director. Among others, abortion was legalized in 1978. Mork also worked on an international level in the United Nations and Council of Europe. He was a member of the executive board of the World Health Organization from 1979 to 1982, from 1980 to 1981 as deputy chair. He was also active in NAVF. He was married to librarian Anna Brit Schjøtt from 1955 to 1978, and was after that a cohabitant with Wenche Margrethe Myhre. He remained health director until his death in October 1992.
