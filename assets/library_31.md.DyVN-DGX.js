Among the artists whose recordings Olof supervised were Karl B√∂hm, Erich Kleiber, Carl Schuricht, Sir Thomas Beecham, Lisa della Casa, Cesare Siepi, Victoria de los √Ångeles, Clifford Curzon, Wilhelm Backhaus and Yehudi Menuhin. Life and career Early years Victor Olof Ahlquist was of Swedish descent.Andry, Peter. \\"Victor Olof\\", Gramophone, January 1975, p. 50 He was born in St Pancras, London, the youngest of five children of Michael Ahlqist, a tailor who retained his Swedish nationality, and his wife Elizabeth.1901 UK census, piece 148, folio 13, page 18 He attended the Guildhall School of Music in London, where he won the Melba Scholarship in 1916.\\"Guildhall School of Music\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 57, No. 883 (September 1916), p. 421 His violin professor was Kalman Ronay.\\"Musical Notes from Abroad\\", The Musical Times , Vol. 64, No. 961 (March1923), p. 210 Among his fellow students were the singers Dora Labbette and Lilian Stiles-Allen. On the advice of the principal of the school, Sir Landon Ronald, he dropped his original surname. In the 1920s Olof founded and led the Victor Olof Sextet, with whom he gave concerts and broadcasts for more than 20 years. In January 1923 he gave a recital in Vienna which included an arrangement for violin and piano of the Elgar Violin Concerto.Neue Freie Presse, 23 January 1923, p. 14. In 1928 he married Phyllis Robey; there were two sons of the marriage.Civil Registration, Volume 2A, pp. 804 and 807 In the 1940s he was an orchestral manager and conductor, working with the London Symphony Orchestra and especially the National Symphony Orchestra, an ad hoc ensemble of top orchestral players assembled for the wealthy musical amateur Sidney Beer. Decca At a recording session Arthur Haddy, chief recording engineer of the Decca Record Company, spotted Olof's acute ear for orchestral balance. He recommended to the head of Decca, Edward Lewis, that Olof should be invited to join the company to produce some of the many recordings planned for the expansion of its classical catalogue. Decca had developed a revolutionary new recording technique known as \\"ffrr\\" (full frequency range recording) which put the company far ahead of its rivals in the realism of sound on its discs. Olof's first sessions as producer were with Decca's renowned engineer Kenneth Wilkinson, recording Eileen Joyce with Beer and his orchestra in music by Grieg, Debussy and Delius in June 1944.Stuart, Philip. Decca Classical, 1929-2009 accessed 10 January 2012. In between supervising sessions of music by composers from Eric Coates to Wagner, Olof conducted some recordings for Decca, mainly of overtures and other short orchestral pieces. At the end of the war, Lewis authorised the expansion of Decca's classical programme to make it international, with recordings in Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich, Geneva, Bayreuth and Vienna. The Decca producer John Culshaw wrote, \\"Within five years of the end of the war Decca was well and truly in the big league.\\"Culshaw, John, \\"50 years of the Decca record label\\", The Gramophone, July 1979, p. 23 Olof was in the thick of this international programme, supervising sessions in all six locations with the exception of Bayreuth (according to Culshaw, Olof did not much like Wagner's music).Culshaw, p. 53 Among the recordings produced by Olof that have seldom been out of the catalogues are Das Lied von der Erde with Bruno Walter and Kathleen Ferrier, and a series of Mozart operas made in 1955 with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and singers mostly from the Vienna State Opera. At that time, Olof was little interested in stereophonic recordings; he supervised the mono recordings with one of Decca's senior engineers, while his assistant, Peter Andry, and a junior engineer made simultaneous stereo recordings of the same sessions. Among those whose recordings Olof supervised for Decca were Josef Krips, Karl B√∂hm, Erich Kleiber, Carl Schuricht, Lisa della Casa, Cesare Siepi, Wilhelm Backhaus and Clifford Curzon. HMV At EMI, Olof took over from Lawrance Collingwood as producer of Sir Thomas Beecham's recordings. He knew Beecham well, having played an important role in assembling the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra for the conductor in 1946.Patmore, David. \\"Sir Thomas Beecham: the Contract Negotiations with RCA Victor, Columbia Records and EMI, 1941‚Äì1959\\", ARSC Journal, 33. 2 (Fall 2002) Having had substantial influence over the choice of repertoire at Decca, Olof was more constrained at EMI, where he was subordinate to the head of the company's International Artistes Department, David Bicknell. The latter, Fred Gaisberg's successor, was responsible for decisions about the artists and repertoire recorded by EMI, and was more inclined than Olof to go along with Beecham's choice of repertoire. Olof's assistant, Peter Andry, wrote in an obituary tribute: Among the EMI recordings produced by Olof are Beecham's set of Carmen, Rudolf Kempe's set of Lohengrin, and all but one act of Andr√© Cluytens' set of The Tales of Hoffmann (the Giulietta act was produced, at Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's insistence, by her husband, Walter Legge). Among the other artists whose performances Olof recorded for EMI were Sir Malcolm Sargent, Sir John Barbirolli and Yehudi Menuhin. He retired from EMI in 1963, but returned to the studios from retirement, his last recording being made when he was 70.\\"Paris\\", High Fidelity/Musical America, Volume 19, 1969 Later years In 1969, Olof was appointed as a member of the Arts Council committee of inquiry into orchestral resources in Britain under the chairmanship of Sir Alan Peacock.\\"Music in London\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 110, No. 1518 (August1969), pp. 849‚Äì853 In retirement, Olof lived at Milford on Sea on the south coast of England.

In 2015, he was sentenced to sixteen years in prison. Early life and education Francesco Schettino was born into a seafaring family in Meta, Campania. He attended the nautical institute Nino Bixio in Piano di Sorrento, then worked for the ferry company Tirrenia. Career In 2002, aged 41, Schettino was hired by Costa Crociere (Costa Cruises), a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation. Starting as an official in charge of security, he moved up to become second-in-command. In 2006, Schettino was promoted to captain and given command of the newly launched Costa Concordia. In 2010, as captain of the Costa Atlantica, he entered the port of Warnem√ºnde, Germany, at too high a speed, allegedly causing damage to the AIDAblu, also a Carnival Corporation ship. In 2014, two years after the Costa Concordia disaster, he was invited to speak at a university - as a panic victim and a demonstration object.  Costa Concordia disaster  Schettino was the captain in charge of the Costa Concordia on 13 January 2012, when the ship attempted a sail-by salute past Giglio, a maneuver he had performed before. The ship struck an underwater rock off the island, partially capsized and listed on its starboard side, resulting in the deaths of 32 people.Costa Concordia \\"Captain‚Äôs Prison Sentence Upheld by Italian Court\\", Time, World, Italy, 31 May 2016; retrieved 4 July 2020. Schettino accepted some degree of responsibility and asked for forgiveness when he talked about those who had died. In 2012, Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, defended his action and indicated that his maneuver after the collision was \\"brilliant\\" and saved lives. In December 2014, another one of Schettino's lawyers, Domenico Pepe, just prior to Schettino's testimony, declared that his client wanted to set the record straight and \\"defend his honor\\". Schettino indicated prior to trial that the underwater rocks that the ship hit were uncharted, the helmsman did not speak English or Italian, and that the ship‚Äôs generators malfunctioned, impeding the rescue effort. Regarding his dry and early departure of the vessel, Schettino had explained that he slipped off the ship when it turned over and fell into a lifeboat. A transcript of a recorded conversation between Schettino and the on-duty Italian Coast Guard captain, Gregorio de Falco, was broadcast across news bulletins. It details a very angry De Falco repeatedly ordering Schettino to leave the lifeboat and return to the stricken Costa Concordia. De Falco clearly does not believe Schettino's explanation of how he 'fell' into the lifeboat, or his excuse for not returning to his vessel because it was \\"too dark\\" and the lifeboat had \\"stopped moving\\". At one point, De Falco was so angered at Schettino's excuses that he told Schettino, \\"Vada a bordo, cazzo!\\", translated as \\"Get the fuck on board!\\", \\"Get on board, for fuck's sake!\\", or \\"Get on board, dammit!\\". Schettino did not do so. Treatment in media Schettino was vilified in extensive media coverage, that dubbed him \\"Captain Coward\\" and \\"Captain Calamity\\". Others in the press noted that Schettino was a daredevil and prone to insubordination. He was even described as \\"Italy's most hated man\\" by the tabloid press. At the end of his trial at Grosseto, Schettino said that he spent three years \\"in a media meat grinder.\\" However, there had also been speculation that Schettino was a handy fall guy for Costa Cruises, which had disassociated itself from him and must have been aware of the practice of a sail-by salute, even requesting it. Costa had communication with Schettino during the interval between the collision with the rock and the evacuation order; some claim this may have led to a delay in the rescue effort. However, Schettino did not contact his employers during the first 15 minutes after the collision. Thus, any such conversation(s) did not distract him from sending a mayday or ordering an evacuation. He reportedly lied to the coast guard to keep rescuers away, and ordered passengers away from \\"muster stations\\" delaying evacuation. Legal proceedings After the accident, Schettino was placed in temporary custody by the prosecutor of Grosseto and released for house arrest on 17 January 2012. On 5 July 2012, Schettino was released from house arrest but mandated to reside in Meta di Sorrento. Prior to Schettino's trial, Pier Luigi Foschi, at that time chairman of Costa, put blame on the captain as being responsible for deviating from the course and sailing close to Giglio. Costa terminated Schettino's employment in 2012. The company declined to pay for his legal defense although it first supported him; instead, after a plea bargain with the prosecution, it became a co-plaintiff in the trial against Schettino. Schettino's trial was separated from a trial against five other Costa employees, namely Roberto Ferrarini (the company's crisis director, who was found guilty of minimizing the extent of the disaster and delaying an adequate response), cabin service director Manrico Giampedroni, first officer Ciro Ambrosio, helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin, and third officer Silvia Coronica. All pleaded guilty in a plea bargaining plan and received jail sentences ranging from eighteen months to two years and ten months. Reuters cited judicial sources as saying none of these individuals were likely to go to jail as sentences less than two years for non-violent offences are routinely suspended in Italy, and longer sentences may be appealed or replaced by community service. Criminal investigations into any role Costa may have had in the disaster were closed after the company agreed to pay a fine of ‚Ç¨1 million. The company may still be liable for civil damages. Court of Grosseto trial On 23 February 2013, the office of the prosecution at Grosseto announced that it had initiated legal proceedings against Schettino. He was accused of multiple counts of manslaughter, causing a maritime accident, abandoning ship with passengers still on board, and lack of cooperation with rescue operations. The trial took place at Grosseto's \\"Teatro Moderno\\", which was adapted into a courtroom to handle lawyers of about 250 co-plaintiffs and about 400 scheduled witnesses. While the other parties involved could plea bargain, Schettino's request to strike a plea bargain himself was denied. By the time he had made his first appearance on 2 December 2014, he was left as the sole person to be accused of manslaughter. \\"Schettino is (now) the only defendant, but he is not the only one responsible\\", opined Daniele Bocciolini, lawyer for some survivors. \\"He's not responsible for the lifeboats that couldn't be launched nor for the (failing) emergency generators\\". In his defense, Schettino explained that the sail-by salute was intended to pay homage to other mariners and, for business reasons, to present passengers a nice view. He denied that he did this to impress a Moldovan dancer whom he had brought to the bridge. She had boarded as a non-paying passenger and later admitted the two were having an affair. Schettino maintained his actions had saved the lives of many after the ship impacted the rock and claimed some of his crew misunderstood and botched his orders. Further, he blamed defective generators and the flooding of compartments for aggravating the situation. His lawyer indicated that these malfunctions were responsible for the fatalities. At the end of the proceeding, the public prosecutor Magistrate Maria Navarro asked for a jail sentence of 26 years and three months. Confirming the charges, she parsed jail times as follows: fourteen years for multiple manslaughter, nine years for causing a shipwreck, three years for abandoning the vessel and three months for failing to contact the authorities when the accident happened. Navarro accused Schettino of lying during the trial as well as in prior public interviews. Prosecutor Stefano Pizza stated, \\"The captain‚Äôs duty to be the last person off the ship is not just an obligation dictated by ancient maritime rules, it is also a legal obligation intended to limit the damage to those on the ship.\\" Schettino's lawyers rebutted the charges and indicated that the disaster was a collective failure for which he should not be made the scapegoat. On 11 February 2015, after a 19-month trial, Judge Giovanni Puliatti read the verdict, sentencing Schettino to sixteen years in prison and five years of interdiction from navigating. The sixteen-year verdict is composed of ten years for manslaughter, five years for causing the shipwreck, and one year for abandoning his passengers, to be served consecutively.  Response to the verdict  Although Costa's lawyer called the verdict \\"balanced\\", others criticized it. Survivors groups saw it as too lenient. On the other hand, it was also argued that Schettino, while guilty, had been made a scapegoat. According to this view, the disaster was a complex failure, involving not only negligence on part of the captain, but also inadequate safety procedures, poor evacuation procedures, communication failures, and technical defects (such as faulty watertight doors). On 31 May 2016, an Italian appeals court upheld Schettino's prison sentence. Schettino further appealed to Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation, which upheld the original sentence on 12 May 2017. He handed himself in to Rome's Rebibbia prison on hearing the verdict of the second appeal, to begin his sentence.  Personal life  Present with him on the bridge during the collision was Moldovan translator Domnica Cemortan, who has admitted she had been having an extramarital affair with Schettino.

Named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, the school served the area of North Webster, which had been settled by many black families after the Civil War. The school was formed when the Webster Groves School District decided to stop paying tuition for students to attend the all-black Sumner High School, founded in 1875, which was miles away in St. Louis. So an elementary school, Douglass Elementary, dating from 1866, was expanded into a high school in the 1920s. Douglass High School was the only accredited public high school for African-American students in St. Louis County until the end of segregation in 1957. History Before the Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), black children in Missouri were not allowed an education. Following the Civil War, many black families had settled in Webster Groves, and in 1866, classes for black children were held in the First Baptist Church on Shady Avenue, taught by a white teacher, Mrs. Dotwell. The School District of Webster Groves took over this responsibility in 1868, a time when there were 30 black children in the area. In 1871, the school had its first black teacher, T. A. Bush, who had 23 students in his class. In 1872, the school moved to a rented structure, until it burned down, after which the school moved back to the church until 1892, when a new elementary school was built. This school, the first public school in Webster Groves, was named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass. In 1898, three students graduated the 8th grade. For further education, tuition needed to be paid for the students to attend the nearest high school for black students, Sumner High School in St. Louis City. Seventy-five percent of the tuition for Webster students was paid by the school district, and the families covered the remaining twenty-five percent. This arrangement was affirmed in 1918, when the Missouri Supreme Court ruled that education should be \\"separate but equal\\". In the 1920s, the School Board decided that the more cost-effective choice was just to found a new school, thus in 1925 Douglass Elementary School was expanded to include ninth grade, and over the next few years, additional grades were added until the school had a complete four-year high-school program. In 1929, the first graduating class consisted of eight students. Black students from all over St. Louis commuted to the school, which was the only accredited high school for blacks in St. Louis County. Another school, Kinloch High School (opened in 1938), had classes for black students but was not accredited. Library access was an issue, as the black students of Douglass High School were only allowed to use the Webster Groves Public Library one afternoon a week; to the city's credit, some public libraries would not allow any black patrons. Eventually a second library was established in the 1930s in North Webster, accessible to the black families there. In 1947, Douglass Elementary School moved to its own separate building, and the entire original school facility was then used for the Douglass High School. In 1954, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, all high schools were integrated. In 1956, Douglass High School was closed, and the old high school building demolished. The Douglass High School building was renovated in 1983 into an apartment building for the elderly at 546 North Elm Avenue. Principals * Herbert Davis, late 1920s * Howell B.

Party claimed that its aim is to represent the interests for the benefit of all Hungarian people living in the country. Based upon a similar ideological background, it preferred the affiliation with the Movement for a Better Hungary (Jobbik), which is a radical and nationalist party in Hungary.http://www.021.rs/Novi-Sad/Vesti/Infiltracija-profasistickih-stranaka- iz-Madarske-u-Vojvodinu.html Currently, the Hungarian Hope Movement does not hold any parliamentary seats; neither in the Serbian parliament, nor the Vojvodinian one. Main Goals The Hungarian Hope Movement (HHM) was one of the parties of Hungarian minority in Vojvodina. It was formed with the purpose to represent the interests, defend and improve the rights of the Hungarian national community in Serbia. Furthermore, HHP is seeking to link Hungarian minority in Serbia with Hungary and with other Hungarian communities in neighboring countries, but also all around the world linguistically, socially, economically and culturally. With these main goals, the Party would like to develop a bright socio-political future for the Hungarian minority in Serbia and to overturn certain political, demographic, social and economical processes, which are seen as negative by this party. Main guidelines The Hungarian Hope Movement (HHM) was a party of Hungarian minority that was formed to represent the short-, mid- and long-term goals which, according to the party, are needed for the development and socio-political survival of the Hungarian community in Vojvodina. The Party puted those matters in priority which have direct impact on the life of its members and in general, of the Hungarians living in Serbia. Besides summarizing, analyzing and searching resolutions for all the problems of their comrades, the HHP makes their goals and guidelines friendly for every citizen. The most important messages and items of these goals and guidelines are available in an articulate form for everyone. HHM was not just a political party, but a movement of actions, which does not deal only with political activity, but also organizes protests, movements and actions affecting the province and everyday life, reaching evident results. Understanding, joining, practicing and fighting for these objectives is open for everyone. The party claims that it is important that the present and future members of HHM understand that this party \\"does not want to be part of the meaningless everyday politics but want to help for the Hungarian minority\\". Some main objectives of HHM ‚Ä¢ Defending and supporting the Hungarian minority, establishing autonomy ‚Ä¢ Establishing a full autonomy for Vojvodina ‚Ä¢ Stopping the migration and assimilation of the Hungarian minority in Serbia ‚Ä¢ Strengthening of public safety with the establishment of a multicultural militia ‚Ä¢ Fight against colonization of Vojvodina ‚Ä¢ Analyzing the attacks committed against the national minorities of Vojvodina ‚Ä¢ Clearing up outstanding historical events, reaching remedy for the war crimes that were committed against Hungarians ‚Ä¢ Strengthening the national feelings of Hungarian citizens, showing the cultural values of the Hungarians in Serbia ‚Ä¢ Fraying out Hungarian citizenship for Hungarians abroad with full voting rights ‚Ä¢ Supporting and developing the poor areas where Hungarians live ‚Ä¢ Endorsing equal language use in practice, both in offices and in the streets ‚Ä¢ Sorting out every other questionable task regarding the Hungarian minority Party positions The HHM had 1 representative in the House of Representatives of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, namely Gyula L√°szl√≥. The party has 1 chosen member in the Hungarian National Council and further 3 committee members. They also have a delegate in the Board of Trustees of the Szekeres Laszl√≥ Foundation,http://www.szla.org.rs/szla/ and numerous delegates in several Boards of the Forum of Hungarian Representatives in the Carpathian- basin.http://www.kmkf.hu/common/main.php?pgid=fooldal&tema;_id=65 Participation in elections In 2012 Vojvodina parliamentary election, the party won 0.59% of votes in the province.

The 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests are a series of ongoing protests taking place in Saudi Arabia, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region. Protests started with a 65-year-old man's self-immolation in Samtah, Jizan on 21 January and protests of a few hundred people in late January in Jeddah and several times throughout February and early March in the cities of Qatif, al-Awamiyah, Riyadh, and Hofuf. A \\"Day of Rage\\" was planned for 11 March. One of the main organisers, Faisal Ahmed Abdul-Ahad (or Abdul-Ahadwas), was alleged to have been killed by Saudi security forces on 2 March, by which time one of the Facebook groups discussing the plans had over 26,000 members. On 11 March, several hundred people protested in Qatif, Hofuf and al-Amawiyah. Khaled al-Johani demonstrated in Riyadh despite a massive police presence, was interviewed by BBC Arabic Television, and has since then been detained in  ΩUlaysha Prison. Al-Johani became known online as \\"the only brave man in Saudi Arabia\\". The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and the Saudi organisation Human Rights First Society called for ACPRA co-founder Mohammed Saleh Albejadi to be released following his arbitrary arrest in Buraidah on 21 March by Mabahith, the internal security agency. In April, several small protests over labour rights took place in front of government ministry buildings in Riyadh, Ta‚Äôif and Tabuk. Protests, made up mainly of Shia protesters, continued in late March and April in Qatif and smaller cities in the Eastern Province such as al-Awamiyah, and Hofuf. The protesters called for the release of prisoners, for the Peninsula Shield Force to be withdrawn from Bahrain, for equal representation in key offices and for reforms in political positions, as they feel marginalised. In response to the 22‚Äì23 March announcement of men-only municipal elections in late September 2011 to elect half the members of local councils, women organised a Facebook women's suffrage campaign called \\"Baladi\\", stating that Saudi Arabian law gives women electoral rights. In April, women in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam tried to register as electors for the 22 September municipal elections despite officials stating that women could not participate. January 21 January 2011 An unidentified 65-year-old man died on 21 January after setting himself on fire in the town of Samtah, Jizan. This was apparently the kingdom's first known case of self-immolation. 29 January 2011 On 29 January, hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of Jeddah in a rare display of criticism against the city's poor infrastructure after deadly floods swept through the city, killing eleven people. Police stopped the demonstration about 15 minutes after it started. About 30 to 50 people were arrested. Hamza Kashgari, at the time a journalist at Al-Bilad, criticised the authorities' response to the floods. On the same day, an online campaign started on Facebook, making demands that included calling for Saudi Arabia to become a constitutional monarchy, and for \\"an end to corruption, an even distribution of wealth, and a serious solution for unemployment\\". February 5 February On 5 February, about 40 women wearing black clothes demonstrated in Riyadh, calling for the release of prisoners held without trial. 10 February On 10 February, a Thomson Reuters report claimed that 10 intellectuals, human rights activists and lawyers came together to create the Umma Islamic Party ‚Äì considered to be the first political party in Saudi Arabia since the 1990s ‚Äì to demand the end of absolute monarchy in the country. On 18 February, all ten founding members of the party were arrested and ordered to withdraw demands for political reform in exchange for their release. 17 February According to Reuters Africa, a small protest was held by Shia in the small town of al-Awamiyah, near Qatif in the Eastern Province to demand the release of three political prisoners held since protests in the town on 19 March 2009 protesting an arrest warrant against the town's Shia imam, Sheikh Nimr Bagir al Namr. The prisoners were identified as Ali Ahmad al Faraj, the sheikh's 16-year-old nephew, and two others, Ali Salih Abdul Jabbar and Makki Al Abbas. The three prisoners were released on 20 February. 24 February A protest was held in Qatif by Shi'a Muslims to demand the release of additional political prisoners. Video posted to YouTube confirms the existence and location of the protest, showing the roundabout 350 meters south of Ohud Road on King Abdelaziz Road.YouTube ‚Äì ŸÖÿ∏ÿßŸáÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ∑ŸäŸÅ ŸÑŸÑÿßŸÅÿ±ÿßÿ¨ ÿπŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿ¨ŸÜÿßÿ° ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿ≥ŸäŸÜ 25 February A group called Jeddah Youth for Change called for a rally in Jeddah on 25 February. Late February Brian Whitaker of The Guardian interpreted the creation of a website for people to publish complaints about government services, \\"shakra.com\\", the circulation of at least three online petitions calling for political and legal reforms and a call for reform that is \\"the result of meaningful interaction and dialogue among the different components of a society\\" by Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal as protest actions that \\"in a Saudi context [are] momentous\\". March 3‚Äì4 March About 100 people, mostly men, and one group of women, marched in Al- Awamiyah and Qatif in the Eastern Province, protesting against prisoners held without trial, calling out \\"Peaceful, peaceful\\". In Qatif, 22 of the protesters were arrested. Police responses in Qatif included attacks on women protesters. Protests following Friday 4 March prayers took place in Riyadh and Hofuf. In Riyadh, at least 3 people were arrested after criticising the monarchy. Both alarmed and annoyed by such action, the Saudi government reminded citizens that public protesting was banned, and that the ban would be strictly enforced. 9‚Äì10 March Protests took place in the evening of 9 March in Qatif. About 600‚Äì800 protesters were present at a similar protest on the evening of 10 March, calling for nine prisoners to be released. About 200 police were present. The police used \\"percussion bombs\\" and shot at protesters with gunfire for about 10 minutes. Three protesters were injured and hospitalised with \\"moderate\\" injuries. 11 March ‚Äì \\"Day of Rage\\" A \\"Day of Rage\\" was planned by Saudi Arabians on 11 March at noon in solidarity with protests in Libya and Bahrain. A Facebook page called for a \\"11 March Revolution of Longing\\" and included demands for \\"the ousting of the regime\\" and for the national leader and the Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia to be chosen by election. It also called for elections for national leadership, more women's rights and for freeing political prisoners. As of 5 March, one of the Facebook groups calling for the Day of Rage had about 26,000 members. On 11 March itself, protests continued for the third day in a row in Qatif and extended to Hofuf and al-Amawiyah, with several hundred protesters participating in the three protests. In Jeddah, The Los Angeles Times and Agence France Presse reported heavy military and police patrolling and an absence of protests. In Riyadh, the police presence was \\"overwhelming\\" by early in the morning of 11 March, with large numbers of police cars present and helicopters that \\"crisscrossed the skies all day\\". One person, Khaled al- Johani, walked past BBC Arabic Television journalists twice and both times was threatened by police that he would be imprisoned if he walked past the journalists, who were accompanied by state escorts, a third time. He stated, \\"I'm here to say we need democracy, we need freedom. We need to speak freely. We will reach out, the government doesn't own us. I was afraid to speak, but no more. We don't have dignity, we don't have justice!\\" He stated that there is no freedom of the press in Saudi Arabia, since it is an absolute monarchy, and that living a dignified life in Saudi Arabia depends on an individual's connection and mercy of Al-Saud princes. After stating his opinion, al-Johani stated his worry that he would be detained before returning home and said that the journalists could visit him at al-Ha'ir or  ΩUlaysha Prison. Al-Johani was detained after he returned home and was not allowed any contact with his family for 58 days. , al-Johani was being held at  ΩUlaysha Prison. After visiting al-Johani in May, family members said that he had lost weight and was depressed. AOL News said that al-Johani became a \\"folk hero in the blink of an eye\\" when the BBC broadcast al-Johani's full statement in April and a six- minute video \\"Where is Khaled?\\" was uploaded to YouTube. According to Mohammad al-Qahtani of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, al-Johani became known online as \\"the only brave man in Saudi Arabia\\". 13 March More than 200 people protested outside of the Ministry of the Interior in Riyadh on Sunday 13 March, asking for information about prisoners and their immediate release. Protester Ahmed Ali said that his brother has been imprisoned for four years and nothing is known about him nor the charges against him. Another protester said that his father has been in prison for 10 years without receiving medical attention for his colon cancer nor a trial. The protesters asked to meet with the Minister for the Interior Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. The request was refused and entry to the Ministry building was refused. 15‚Äì18 March On 15 March, about 1000 people protested in Qatif calling for the Peninsula Shield Force to be withdrawn from Bahrain, where it is being used against Bahraini protesters. A related protest took place in al-Awamiyah. Hundreds of people protested in Qatif and the nearby region on 16 March, calling for the release of prisoners and expressing support for the Bahraini protesters. Anti-riot forces were present at the protests. The Qatif demonstration lasted for about half an hour. Protesters called for the Peninsula Shield Force to be withdrawn from Bahrain. The protests continued the following day, 17 March, in and near Qatif, with similar demands, and about 4000 protesters in Qatif. Police fired rubber bullets and several people were injured. One slogan used in the protests was \\"Bahrain Free Free. Saudi forces out!\\". Similar protests took place on Friday 18 March, in Qatif, Omran, al-Awamiyah (about 2500 protesters), Safwa City and al-Rabeeya (1000 protesters each). Ten people in Omran were injured from being hit by police batons. One of the slogans in Qatif was \\"One people not two people ‚Äì the people of Qatif and Bahrain!\\" 20 March ‚Äì 1 April Calls for protests on 20 March were made on a Facebook page in late February. On 20 March, about 100 people demonstrated outside the Ministry of the Interior in Riyadh, calling for family members imprisoned without trial to be released, for the third time in March, following similar protests on 4 March and 13 March. The demonstrators tried to enter the Ministry building, which was surrounded by about 50 police cars. About 15 to 50 protesters were arrested. Hundreds demonstrated in Qatif on 20 March against the use of the Peninsula Shield Force troops from the six Gulf Cooperation Council states against the 2011 Bahraini uprising. Reuters described the intervention in Bahrain as having caused the protests to intensify, reporting an incident in which the second home of Sheikh Wajeeh al-Awjami, a judge calling for street protests to stop, was burnt by angry youths. Similar protests by hundreds of people in villages near Qatif took place on Friday 25 March and again in Qatif and al- Awamiyah on 1 April. April 5 April About a hundred literacy campaign teachers held a street demonstration outside the Ministry of Civil Services in Riyadh on 5 April, demanding to be employed full-time. Similar demonstrations took place in Ta‚Äôif and Tabuk. Officials at the Ministry in Riyadh promised to fulfill the demands. 8 April Hundreds of people again protested in Qatif and al-Awamiyah against the use of the Peninsula Shield Force troops from the six Gulf Cooperation Council states against the 2011 Bahraini uprising and for their own political rights and freedoms. Thomson Reuters stated that no riot police were seen at the Qatif demonstration. Press TV said that there was a heavy presence of security forces at both demonstrations, but no clashes or arrests occurred. 10 April On Sunday 10 April, small protests by literacy teachers and unemployed university graduates regarding labour rights took place in front of the Ministries of Civil Services and Education in Riyadh and the Ministry of Education in Jeddah. Facebook was used for coordinating one of the protests. 14‚Äì15 April Protests against the use of the Peninsula Shield Force troops in the 2011 Bahraini uprising and for local political rights and freedoms, including the release of prisoners held without trial, again took place in Qatif and al-Awamiyah on 14 and 15 April, with about 400‚Äì500 protesters in each town and no clashes with police. 21‚Äì22 April Protests for similar reasons again took place in Qatif, al- Awamiyah and Saihat by a few tens to a few hundred protesters. A new complaint made by the protesters was against the destruction of mosques in Bahrain by the Peninsula Shield Force. 23‚Äì25 April In a civil disobedience action from 23‚Äì25 April, women in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam tried to register as electors for the 22 September municipal elections despite an official ban against women's participation. The Gulf News said that there was \\"strong public opinion ... supporting women's participation in the election process\\" following local newspapers' publication of photos of women waiting in queues to register for the election. Fawzia Al Hani, chair of the \\"Baladi\\" Facebook campaign, said that Saudi Arabian law states that women have the right to vote and to stand as candidates. 29 April In the Eastern Province during the days leading up to 29 April, about 20 to 30 people, including two bloggers, were arrested for anti-government activities. On 29 April, a few hundred people demonstrated in Qatif and al-Awamiyah for similar reasons to previous weeks. Five protesters were injured by police in Qatif.

The 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests are a series of ongoing protests taking place in Saudi Arabia, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region. In May and June, motivated by the Arab Spring, Manal al-Sharif and other women organised a women's right-to-drive campaign, with the main action to take place on 17 June. Al-Sharif drove a car in May and was detained on 22 May and from 23‚Äí30 May. Other women also drove cars, including actress Wajnat Rahbini, who was arrested after driving in Jeddah on 4 June and released a day later. From 17 June to late June, about seventy cases of women driving were documented. In late September, Shaima Jastania was sentenced to 10 lashes for driving in Jeddah, shortly after King Abdullah announced women's participation in the 2015 municipal elections and eligibility as Consultative Assembly members. King Abdullah cancelled the sentence. Protests in the Qatif region continued in May and in October protests, police shot live ammunition at protestors. The protestors called for Eastern Province to have its own constitution and legislative assembly, and for their association Society for Development and Change to be legally registered. In late November, Nasser al-Mheishi, Ali al-Felfel, Munib al- Sayyed al-\`Adnan and Ali Abdullah al-Qarairis were shot dead by security forces in the Qatif region in successive protests and funerals. The protests continued in December. Hundreds of people protested in Riyadh and Buraidah in December, calling for the release or trial of prisoners. May Street protests in and near Qatif and the beginning of a women's driving campaign took place in May 2011. According to Press TV, hundreds of people protested in Qatif on 5 May, hundreds protested in Qatif and al-Awamiyah on 13 May, and protests occurred in Qatif on 20 May. The protests were against the use of the Peninsula Shield Force troops in the Bahraini uprising, against the arbitrary detention of protestors in previous demonstrations, and for improved human rights, especially freedom of speech. During the second week of May 2011, a woman inspired by the Arab Spring, Najla Hariri, started driving a car in Jeddah despite a de facto ban on women driving. She stated, \\"Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [But] after what has happened in the Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me.\\" On 21 May, Manal al-Sharif, a women's rights activist who helped start a women's right to drive campaign, was detained for six hours after a video showing her driving in Khobar in the Eastern Province, filmed by another women's rights activist, Wajeha al-Huwaider, gained widespread popularity on YouTube and Facebook. Al- Sharif was detained again from 22 May to 30 May, when she was released on bail, on the conditions of returning for questioning if requested, not driving and not talking to the media. The New York Times and Associated Press associated the long duration of al-Sharif's detention with Saudi authorities' fear of protests. On 23 May, another woman was detained for driving a car. She drove with two women passengers in Ar Rass and was detained by traffic police in the presence of the religious police (CPVPV). She was released after signing a statement that she would not drive again. In reaction to al-Sharif's arrest, several more Saudi women published videos of themselves driving during the following days. June The women's driving campaign continued in June. Wajnat Rahbini, a Saudi actress famous in the Arab world for playing in the satirical comedy Tash ma Tash, broadcast annually during Ramadan, drove her car \\"in defiance of a long-standing ban on female driving\\" on 4 June in Jeddah. She was detained after exiting her car and released the following day without bail. On 17 June, the main date for the women's driving campaign, about 30 to 40 women drove cars in towns around Saudi Arabia, including Maha al-Qahtani and Eman al-Nafjan in Riyadh, and other women in Jeddah and Dammam. When she drove for a second time the same day, al-Qahtani was given a ticket for driving without a Saudi Arabian licence. The Guardian interpreted the lack of arrests as a deliberate change in government policy, stating, \\"police appeared to be under orders not to intervene.\\" October On 4 October, there was a firefight between unidentified gunmen and Saudi security personnel in Qatif, injuring between 11 police and at least 3 civilians. The government blamed \\"a foreign country\\", presumably Iran, for the unrest. This confrontation grew out of a conflict in Awamiyah, a predominantly Shi'a town in the Qatif district, when security forces arrested a 60-year-old man to force his son, who was active in a movement to force Saudi Arabia to withdraw from Bahrain, to give himself up. Molotov cocktails were thrown at the police station. The protestors want a constitution and an independent legislative assembly for the Eastern Province and for the Society for Development and Change to be legally registered. November On 20, 21 and 23 November, five people, a 9-year-old girl, Nasser al-Mheishi, Ali al-Felfel, Munib al-Sayyed al-\`Adnan and Ali Abdullah al-Qarairis were killed and six others were wounded by police bullets during a protest in Qatif, the funeral for al-Muhaishi, and a follow-up protest for the deaths of al-Muhaishi and al-Filfil.  December  On 16 December, about 100 people, mostly women, protested in Riyadh and Buraidah demanding that prisoners be released or tried. About 50 people were arrested in the two cities. Many were released by 23 December. On 23 December, a nationwide mosque sit-in protest again took place in cities including Riyadh and Jeddah, calling for the release of Dr. Yusuf al-Ahmad, imprisoned after having sent a Twitter message in support of prisoners' families. The protestors said that there are 30,000 political prisoners, mostly prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia. Thirty men and thirty women among the Riyadh protestors were arrested. Most were released by 28 December.

The 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests are a series of ongoing protests taking place in Saudi Arabia, which began in January 2011, influenced by concurrent protests in the region. A protest for labour rights took place in Riyadh on 14 January and a sit-in calling for the Syrian Ambassador to be expelled occurred on 5 February in Jeddah. Protests in the Qatif region continued from January to May, with security forces using live fire against protestors, killing four, and arresting medical personnel. Security forces shot dead Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah in al-Awamiyah on 12 or 13 January, Montazar Sa'eed al-Abdel in al-Awamiyah on 26 January, and Munir al-Midani and Zuhair al-Said on 9 and 10 February. In the 70,000 strong funeral for Abdallah on 16 January in al-Awamiyah and the daily Qatif region protests that followed, protestors chanted slogans against the House of Saud and Minister of Interior, Nayef, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. In mid- February, two medical personnel were arrested for having clandestinely treated injured protestors. In a 10 February protest and a 13 February funeral, an effigy of Nayef was thrown at tanks and participants described Nayef as a \\"terrorist\\", \\"criminal\\" and \\"butcher\\". Police described two of the fatal shootings as responses to unidentified gunmen who had shot first. Manal al- Sharif and Samar Badawi, active in the women to drive movement, announced that they had filed lawsuits against Saudi authorities in the Grievances Board, a non-Sharia court, because of the rejection of their driving licence applications. As of the end of June 2012, 100 Saudi women had started driving regularly since the June 2011 campaign launch. Women university students protested in King Khalid University in Abha in March and were attacked by security forces, leading to one death. Other university protests followed in Taibah University in Medina and Tabuk University in March and April.  January 2012   early January  On 6 January 2012, about two hundred people protested in Qatif against the Saudi government and in support of Bahrainis. On 10 January, police fired lived bullets at a Qatif protest calling for the release of political prisoners gay . 12‚Äì13 January Late on 12 January or at dawn on 13 January, during demonstrations calling for the \\"release of political detainees, reform and an end to sectarian discrimination\\", Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah was killed by security forces in al-Awamiyah after demonstrators threw stones at them according to Al Jazeera English and BBC News. The Saudi Ministry of Interior said that a security vehicle had been attacked by petrol bombs and caught fire, and that while dealing with the fire, security forces were shot at and responded. Amnesty International called for an independent investigation into the killing. Amnesty International said that the killing of four protestors by Saudi security forces in November 2011 had not been investigated despite promises by the authorities. On 13 January, hundreds of protestors gathered in response to Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah's death. Videos of the protests were distributed on Facebook, showing protestors chanting, \\"We will not forget you, o martyrs.\\" 14 January On 14 January, protests calling for labor rights and opposing corruption took place in Riyadh in front of the ministries of health and employment. One Saudi security force member was shot and wounded by unknown attackers on 14 January in the Qatif region. The Guardian suggested that this could have been related to protestors using violence because of the apparent ineffectiveness of peaceful protests, but that it was unclear if the shooting was related to the political protests. Saudi attributed the attacks to protestors on 24 January. 16‚Äì22 January On 16 January, 70,000 mourners accompanied Issam Mohamed Abu Abdallah's body in a funeral procession in al- Amawiyah. Mourners chanted slogans against the House of Saud and against late Minister of Interior, Nayef, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, including \\"Down with Al Saud\\", \\"Down with Nayef\\" and \\"Nayef, you are responsible of killing the martyr\\". On the same day, al-Awamiyah residents started signing a petition calling for an independent investigation into the protestors' deaths, gathering 760 signatures by 23 January. On 17 January, thousands protested in Qatif against the killing. On 18 January 40 people protested on Tarut Island and in Saihat to honour those killed and in support of prisoners. They chanted slogans against the House of Saud. In protests in the Qatif region on 19 January, slogans were critical of the House of Saud and the Minister of Interior. Two Saudi security force members were wounded by unidentified attackers on 18 or 20 January. This was later attributed by Saudi authorities to street protestors. In Friday prayers on 20 January, Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, the prayer leader in al-Awamiyah, criticised the authorities' arrests and shootings of anti-government protestors, called on the government to \\"stop bloodshed\\", and predicted the overthrow of the government if the crackdown were to continue. 23‚Äì27 January  On 23 January, The Guardian referred to the al-Amawiyah protestors as \\"[seeming] to have started an uprising\\", and that activists have dubbed the uprising as the \\"Intifada of dignity\\". Police arrested social activist Zaher al-Zaher in al-Awamiyah. On 24 January, security forces used live ammunition against protestors in Qatif, wounding several, some of whom were in critical condition, and arresting nine. Saudi authorities accused the arrestees of \\"instigating riots\\", of anti-government protests and of the 14 and 18 January wounding of three security force members by firearms. In a demonstration on Tarut Island on 25 January, protestors chanted \\"Nayef, you are responsible for the killing of protestors\\", in reference to Minister of Interior Nayef. Security forces attacked protestors in al-Awamiyah on 26 January, wounding two people and killing Montazar Sa'eed al-Abdel. On 27 January, a protest in Qatif called for the immediate withdrawal of the Peninsula Shield Force from Bahrain.

A call for the protest started on Facebook two days earlier. The protestors marched from Kerbala Square to al-Karama Square, where security forces threatened marchers using motor vehicles and by firing gunshots in the air. On 3 February, a demonstration took place in Qatif calling for Shia minority rights and for security forces responsible for shooting protestors to be prosecuted. On 5 February 2012, a sit-in by Hamza Kashgari and colleagues took place at Nawras Circle in Jeddah, calling for the Syrian Ambassador in Riyadh to be expelled in relation to the 2011‚Äì2012 Syrian uprising. Kashgari was briefly detained by police. On 7 February, security forces attempted to arrest Abdullah al-Sureih, who had made a speech at the 3 February Qatif demonstration, at his home. The arrest attempt was blocked by al-Sureih's supporters. Manal al-Sharif and Samar Badawi, active in the women to drive movement, announced that they had filed lawsuits against Saudi authorities in the Grievances Board, a non-Sharia court, for the rejection of their driving licence applications. Towards the end of a peaceful march in Qatif on 9 February calling for reforms, security forces used live fire against protestors, killing Muneer al-Midani () by a shot to the heart and wounding 6‚Äì14 other protestors. Security forces surrounded the central Qatif hospital and the Mushfi general hospital in order to transfer the injured to a military hospital. A police spokesperson said that the security forces shot at \\"a group of unidentified gunmen who had shot at security forces patrolling the area\\". The spokesperson said that one man died from the security forces' shots, that three were wounded, and that the wounded were taken to a local hospital. On 10 February, the Friday Prayers leader in al-Awamiyah called for the Saudi monarchy to be abolished. A march for Mawlid took place in which participants called for reform and for the release of prisoners. A protestor threw an effigy of Minister of Interior Nayef at a \\"row of armoured anti-riot tanks\\". Security forces shot dead Zuhair al-Said (or Zaheer Abdullah Saeed, ). A police spokesperson stated, \\"While security men were following up on an illegal gathering in the town of al- Awamiya in Qatif on Friday [10 February] they were attacked by gunfire. They dealt with the situation by firing back, which resulted with the death of one.\\" Eastern Province activists declared 11 February to be a day of mourning. Demonstrations calling for \\"regime change\\" took place in Qatif, al-Awamiyah and Safwa and schools and shops were closed. At a funeral for Zuhair on 13 February, participants chanted, \\"No Sunna, No Shia, but Islamic unity! We're not afraid, down with Nayef! You're the terrorist, you're the criminal, you're the butcher, ya Nayef! We will never rest, country of oppressors! Son of Saud [royal family], hear the voice! We will never give up 'til death!\\"  Mid- February  On or before 15 February, security forces arrested a Syrian doctor, Abdul Kareem al-Na'eem, in an al-Awamiyah medical centre, and a male nurse, Abdul Aziz al-Mohsen, in al-Qudaih, on the grounds that they had treated protestors injured during political protests without registering the protestors' names. On 16 February, women made a sit-in in Safwa protesting against injustice and discrimination and appealing for international attention. Security forces arrested some young men in Safwa. On 17 February, hundreds of people marched in Qatif to symbolise the anniversary of their protests and chanted slogans against Eastern Province Governor Muhammad bin Fahd and the Bahraini government.  Late February  Protests continued in Qatif, Saihat and Tarut Island on 22 February, in Qatif and al-Awamiyah on 23 February, and in Qatif and Tarut Island on 24 February. Security forces shot live bullets against protestors in the 24 February Qatif protest after the latter chanted slogans opposing the government and calling for the \\"downfall\\" of the House of Saud. Three people were injured by the bullets. March  Early March  According to Press TV, an explosion on 1 March destroyed a petroleum pipeline in al-Awamiyah that leads to a major pipeline running from Abqaiq to Ras Tanura. Ministry of Interior spokesperson Mansour al-Turki stated, \\"There were no acts of sabotage in the kingdom [on 1 March].\\" FXstreet quoted part of a report on the event by \\"The Arab Digest\\". The Arab Digest report linked the would-be fire to the 2011‚Äì2012 Saudi Arabian protests, claimed that the fire occurred between al-Awamiyah and Safwa, and hyperlinked to blog photos of the would-be fire. An anti-government protest took place in al-Rabeeya on 2 March. On 6 March, women students at King Khalid University in Abha, 'Asir Province, protested against \\"injustice and inequality,\\" \\"discrimination and mistreatment\\" by university security staff, and \\"allowing the campus to deteriorate [and] ongoing corruption in the country\\". The protest was continued by 1000 women on 7 March. Security forces attacked the students \\"with batons, fire extinguishers, and water hoses\\", injuring 50 and leading to the death of Hajer al-Yazidi. The security forces' actions were criticised on social networking services including Twitter. A King Khalid University statement described the events, stating, \\"The situation evolved and chaos spread along with damage to public property and the use of fire extinguishers and water hoses against the other female students. Some lost consciousness and had to be taken away for medical assistance, and the university and the relevant authorities took the necessary security measures, until the complex was completely evacuated. The university will explore all the factors that led to the situation and deal with them, in the interest of public safety\\". On 10 March, women at King Khalid University carried out a sit-in and men at the university carried out another protest, both calling for Abdullah al-Rashid, the head of King Khalid University, to resign or be dismissed. Governor Faisal bin Khalid of 'Asir Province ordered an investigation to \\"consider the demands of the students\\" and said that the students' demands would be passed on to King Abdullah. Deputy Governor of 'Asir Province, Abdel Karim al-Hunaini, stated that the students had the right to protest. Mid-March Following the King Khalid University protests in Abha, protests took place in Riyadh, al-Namas, Arar, Qatif and al-Rabeeya. A student criticised university conditions at a public meeting with the head of Taibah University in Medina and was expelled as a result. The Arab Network for Human Rights Information claimed that there was a \\"[protest] movement [spreading] at the universities level\\". The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) organised 38 people who planned a hunger strike on 15‚Äì16 March to call for ACPRA co-founder Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi to be released from prison.  April  On 8 April, first-year women students at Tabuk University protested against faculty behaviour and nepotism, called for better services and assessment, the right to use mobile telephones and the opening of a dental clinic, and called for some expatriate faculty to be replaced by Saudis. On 10 April, Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi, co-founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), was sentenced to four years' imprisonment and a five-year ban on foreign travel for \\"unlawfully establishing a human rights organisation; distorting the state's reputation in media; impugning judicial independence; instigating relatives of political detainees to demonstrate and protest; and possessing censored books\\".

It was started in 1978 by owners Ron Mahonin and Val Mahonin. The first single, \\"A Hit Song\\" was written by Ron Mahonin and recorded at One Step Up in Los Angeles under the direction of manager Marc Gordon, who added Mahonin to his artist roster. The song (also known as \\"Trying To Write A Hit Song\\") had previously won semi-finalist in the American Song Festival and was covered by the pop group Player on their debut album of the same name. The single was released in Canada on the self-owned label simply out of need to get the recording out and recoup some of the investment - and surprisingly the record quickly gained ground in Canadian radio airplay, and a distribution deal was made with Quality Records, thus giving the label a chance to release a second single with some credibility. The label grew (almost unintentionally) to release some 38 singles and half a dozen albums - from Adult Contemporary and Pop to Country - over the course of its five year existence. Some artists releasing on the label were Rick Morgenstern, Ron Mahonin, Doug Watt, Sherry Kennedy Mary Lu Zahalan to name a few. Mindful of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission Canadian content regulations and after substantial Canadian airplay, some releases picked up notable awards - for example, Mahonin's \\"You Came Into My Life\\" won Pro Canada's Song of the Year Award for outstanding airplay, as did \\"Hotel Eldorado\\" penned by Bonnie James (Kruzik) and Ed Molyski. A number of the releases were distributed in other countries, and songs from the publishing catalogue were subsequently re-recorded by other artists in other countries. Via sub-publishing and co-publishing arrangements, some of these recordings were released in countries such as Spain, France, Belgium, Portugal, South Africa and some, such as The Kids even found a position on the Top 40 charts of Japan. As the label's popularity grew, and after floundering through various distributors until finally organizing its own distribution network, the label gained a broader acceptance in the Canadian industry - both in the radio community and the distribution community. Not only were songwriters and other publishers trying to align with this growing company, but surprisingly, a few other well-known independent Canadian labels sought distribution with the Heart Records network. Prior to its demise in 1983, the label was named the Number 7 most popular label in an RPM Magazine poll, as voted for by the radio industry reporting to RPM. Sadly, the financial backing needed to compete on the world stage was never secured, and the label quietly closed its doors in 1983 after contributing to the mosaic of the Canadian music industry for a six year stretch.

He was reportedly involved in the 2008 attacks on Christians in southern Karnataka on 14 September 2008. He claimed that he was incarcerated for 42 days in Mangalore before being released on conditional bail by Karnataka High Court Justice Ashok B. Hinchigeri on 25 October 2008, and was used as a scapegoat by the Bharatiya Janata Party regime to \\"save the government from further embarrassment after the church attacks and on instructions from the Sangh Parivar leaders.\\" He denied that any Catholic churches were attacked by his group during the attacks but reportedly accepted responsibility for the attacks on prayer halls belonging to the New Life Fellowship Trust. The Bajrang Dal were reported to have stated that they were not against Christianity in the region but were offended by the alleged forcible conversions. Kumar had initially denied any involvement in the attacks before being arrested. When asked again at a later date though if he had accepted responsibility for the attacks he denied it. Kumar resigned from Bajrang Dal on 1 October 2008 after witnessing a Hindu woman who had decided to commit suicide with her three children but was saved by Christian missionaries. He stated \\"That was the time I realised that life is more important than dharma (religion). A lot needs to be done for the betterment of life. My dream is to build a society that values life more than religion. In jail I read several literary works. I joined Bajrang Dal so that we could mobilise the youth for a good cause, but at the end of the day all our concepts were politically motivated.\\" In February 2011, after the commission reports into the attacks were published, Kumar formally apologised to the public for the attacks and accused the BJP Government of corruption. On 21 February 2011 he joined the Janata Dal Party (JDS), declaring, \\"I am today shedding the shackles of communalism to strive for communal harmony, for which the JDS is working.\\" He was succeeded as state convener of the Bajrang Dal by Suryanarayana. Kumar died in Bengaluru of a heart attack on 25 April 2020.

Trams continued to operate until 1927.The Golden Age of Tramways. Published by Taylor and Francis. History Tramways in Wrexham started in October 1876 with trams hauled by horses when a single line operated between New Inn, Johnstown to the toll bar on the outskirts of Wrexham. On 1 November 1876 this toll bar was removed and the line was extended to the town centre. The company was acquired in 1900 by Wrexham and District Electric Tramways, a company set up by the British Electric Traction group. They converted the line to 3'6\\" gauge and electrified it. The work was carried out by Dick, Kerr & Co.The Tramways of Wrexham and District, H.G. Dibdin, Tramway Review, Vol. 15, No 117, 1984 Following an inspection by Lt Col. Sir Horatio Arthur Yorke, from the Board of Trade, services started on 4 April 1903. A new depot was provided at Johnstown, at the corner of Offa Street and Maelor Road, constructed by Jenkins & Jones of Johnstown of Ruabon brick. The depot survived long after the closure of the tramway, one subsequent use being a bus garage for the Crosville Company. It was finally demolished sometime between 2005 and 2010. Electricity at 550V was obtained from the Wrexham Corporation power station in Willow Road. A 21-year agreement was put in place at the opening of the tramway for the rates at which the company would be charged for its use of power. Drivers were encouraged to operate economic driving practices to minimise the expense to the company. When this agreement expired, the company was forced into an annual contract with the prospect of yearly increases in the unit charge. The service was extended on 26 May 1903 past Wrexham GWR railway station to the Turf Hotel. From Johnstown the line was taken into the new development at the west of the Wrexham-Ruabon road, reaching Duke Street, Rhosllannerchrugog by the end of 1904. An extension to Ruabon had been authorised, but was never built. In 1912 the company started experimenting with bus operation and soon realised that this was where most of the profits were going to be made. In recognition of this in 1914 the company changed its name to Wrexham and District Transport Company Limited. However, any plans for expansion of bus services were put on hold with the outbreak of the First World War in the same year and the motor buses that the company had acquired were requisitioned by the armed forces. After the war, the company suffered from competition as the military authorities disposed of much surplus equipment including motor buses and Wrexham Council issued hackney licences freely to anyone requesting them. Fleet There were 10 tramcars built by Brush Electrical Engineering Company of Loughborough. The livery was red and cream. The vehicles could seat 26 on the upper deck and 20 inside on the lower deck.

(August 26, 1919 ‚Äì August 9, 2012) was an American Catholic priest, Jesuit, and historian who became the president of Georgetown University. Born in Pennsylvania, he entered the Society of Jesus at the age of 20 and studied at West Baden College, and Fordham University, before earning his doctorate at Princeton University. A promising historian, he then taught at Loyola University Maryland, before becoming the executive vice president of Georgetown University in 1963, where he effectively worked as acting president. The following year, Campbell was appointed the president of Georgetown University. He continued the work of his predecessor to modernize the institution. Extensively reorganizing the university's governance, he amended its congressional charter, legally separated Georgetown from the Society of Jesus, and transformed the composition of its board of directors from senior Jesuit administrators to laypeople and Jesuits unaffiliated with the university. He also recruited prominent faculty in the humanities and social sciences, and gave faculty a direct role in administration by creating a faculty senate. At the end of his term, ground was broken on Lauinger Library, which greatly expanded the university's library capacity. Campbell's tenure as president was brief, as he preferred scholarship over academic administration. Combined with a mounting budgetary deficit, he resigned the office in 1968. Campbell then worked for the Jesuits' Maryland Province before becoming rector of the Jesuit novitiate in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. He returned to Georgetown as the director of the Woodstock Theological Center in 1979, and then founded the Center for Jesuit Spirituality at Holy Trinity Church.  Early life  Gerard John Campbell was born on August 26, 1919, in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1939, and began his studies at West Baden College, a Jesuit seminary in Indiana, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Latin in 1943, and a Licentiate of Philosophy. In 1945, he became a professor at Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia. Campbell followed the classical, Jesuit liberal arts curriculum at Loyola University Chicago and Woodstock College, and was ordained a priest in 1951. He then received a Master of Arts in history from Fordham University in 1954. He completed his education at Princeton University, where he earned a Doctor of Philosophy in history in 1957. The Princeton faculty were impressed by Campbell's academic potential, and he was considered a promising historian. After receiving his doctorate, he became a professor of history at Loyola University Maryland. He remained there until 1962, when he returned to Princeton for postdoctoral work.  Georgetown University  While at Princeton in 1963, Campbell learned that he had been appointed the executive vice president of Georgetown University. Georgetown's president, Edward B. Bunn, and the provincial superior of the Jesuits' Maryland province had decided that Campbell would fill the newly created position to allow Bunn to travel extensively to raise money for the university. For the one year that he was vice president, he functioned effectively as the acting president, and became the apparent successor to Bunn.  Presidency  On December 3, 1964, Campbell was appointed the president of Georgetown University. Aged 45, he assumed the office as one of the youngest presidents in the university's history, and was the first to hold a doctorate from a non-Catholic university. As a result, The Washington Post characterized him as a \\"new breed of Jesuit priest whose style might be described as Ivy League Catholic.\\" Campbell sought to continue the work of his predecessor, and identified three objects as the most important on his agenda: the recruitment of talented faculty to improve postgraduate education, increasing the role of the university in the Washington, D.C. community, and significantly increasing fundraising. On January 31, 1965, Campbell served as the homilist for the Archdiocese of Washington's Red Mass, which was attended by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Lady Bird Johnson, presidential aid Jack J. Valenti, Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan and Speaker of the House John W. McCormack. Campbell undertook numerous reforms of the university's governance, bringing it into conformity with other American universities. Upon entering into office, he amended the university's antiquated congressional charter and created expansive bylaws to officially allow the university to govern itself as it unofficially already had already been. This involved a separation of the board of directors, which controlled the university, from the corporation. The latter legally owned the university and the role of the five-member body was defined as being only to appoint its own successors and members of the board of directors. Reinventing the nature of the board, he greatly increased the role of the laity in the administration of the university. Campbell transformed the board from a body composed of exclusively senior Jesuit administrators at Georgetown to one that comprised laity and Jesuits unaffiliated with the university. Its role as a consultative body also gave way to one of actual governance. alt=Lauinger Library and Healy Lawn The result of this reform of the board was that Georgetown became legally independent of the Society of Jesus. Therefore, Campbell had to obtain the permission of the Maryland provincial superior as well as the Superior General in Rome. He also secured an act of Congress to amend the charter, which was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. The Jesuit community at Georgetown was separately incorporated, and retained ownership of several historic buildings on campus. The offices of president of the university and rector of the Jesuit community were made separate and held by different people. While Campbell's predecessor focussed particularly on improving the quality and stature of the science faculty, Campbell recruited esteemed faculty in the humanities and social sciences. The appointment of faculty became a more formalized process, with the creation of a rank and tenure committee, and the overall size of the faculty increased. Jesuits were no longer appointed to the faculty by the Jesuit superiors, and instead competed with all other applicants for positions. At the same time, the number of Jesuit faculty increased. The faculty was given a direct role in the administration of the university through the creation of a faculty senate. In January 1965, Campbell began raising money for the construction of a new library, planning of which began several years earlier. Designed by John Carl Warnecke, groundbreaking on Lauinger Library occurred in 1968, and the building was completed in October 1971. The new facility greatly relieved the inadequate library space on campus. Alongside this expansion, Georgetown's operating budget had steadily increased. Campbell began a fundraising drive to raise $26 million beginning in 1966, which would fund fellowships, scholarships, pay salaries, and build the new Georgetown University Law Center. However, the drive raised just $15 million by 1968. Facing a severe deficit, the board of directors instituted strict austerity measures. In addition to governance reforms, Campbell encouraged new community service initiatives by Georgetown students throughout the District of Columbia. He also signed the 1967 Land O'Lakes Statement, which redefined the mission of a modern Catholic university. Facing deteriorating health and the increasing campus turmoil of the late 1960s, Campbell resigned the presidency in 1968. Those close to him observed that during his brief term, he never enjoyed being president, and preferred to return to a life of scholarship. He was succeeded as president by Robert J. Henle.  Later years  After stepping down as president, Campbell spent the rest of his life in Jesuit academic administration. He worked for the Jesuit Maryland Province, before becoming the rector of the Jesuit Novitiate of St. Isaac Jogues in Wernersville, Pennsylvania. In 1979, he returned to Georgetown University as the director of the Woodstock Theological Center. Four years later, he founded the Center of Jesuit Spirituality at Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown neighborhood. He remained director of the spirituality center until his retirement in 2004.

The two men aboard the barge were rescued by an RAF Sea King flying from RAF Brawdy, after attempts to reconnect the tow line failed.

Background  Little is known about Jaros‚Äô background. He was born into a working-class family in Zag√≥rze (now a district of Sosnowiec), did not graduate from any schools, and was self-taught.Chcia≈Ç zabiƒá Gomu≈Çkƒô ‚Äì stracono go na szubienicy. PAP, December 2, 2011 Unlike most Poles during the Communist era he did not hold down a permanent job, supporting himself mostly through services he rendered to the local population, in which he used his knowledge of electromechanics. Jaros did not have a wife or children, lived in Zag√≥rze with his mother, and had a sister. He worked sporadically at the local coal mines and other enterprises, where he would steal explosives and fuses. He began his \\"career\\" in explosives as early as 1948, at the age of sixteen. In that year Jaros tried to steal 100 bullets from a Boilers Factory in Sosnowiec. Caught and tortured by officers of Milicja Obywatelska (MO), he was sentenced to two years in prison.Zabiƒá Wies≈Çawa by Newsweek Polska, 09 sierpnia 2011 In 1951 Jaros was released and decided to take revenge on the Communist government. In the same year, he blew up telephone facilities in DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza. Then, using stolen ammonite, he blew up a utility pole at Sosnowiec Steelworks, as well as an excavator at the Kazimierz Coal Mine in Sosnowiec. To \\"honor\\" Joseph Stalin's death, in 1953, Jaros planted a bomb under a transformer at the Joseph Stalin Coal Mine (formerly known as Renard Coal Mine) in Sosnowiec. Jaros was very careful, his bombs did not kill anybody, he never left any traces, and agents of S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa's local office in Katowice believed that some anti-government organization stood behind these incidents.  First assassination attempt of Gomu≈Çka and Khrushchev  On July 15, 1959, a delegation of both Polish and Soviet governments visited the industrial regions of Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie and Upper Silesia. The delegation consisted of several high-ranking officials, including Polish leader W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, and the First Secretary of the local office of the Polish Communist Party, Edward Gierek (who himself was born in Sosnowiec's district of PorƒÖbka).10 lat temu zmar≈Ç Edward Gierek, Dzieje.pl, Portal historyczny, July 28, 2011 Khrushchev came to Poland to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the People's Republic of Poland (see July Manifesto),Mieli zabiƒá Chruszczowa i Gomu≈Çkƒô ‚Äì Tadeusz M. P≈Çu≈ºa≈Ñski, 3 stycznia 2007 and Gierek served as his and Gomu≈Çka's guide. On July 5, 1959, the \\"Trybuna Robotnicza\\" (Worker's Tribune) daily published a map of the route of the motorcade, so that people would be able to greet the leaders. The officials travelled along Red Army Street (ulica Armii Czerwonej), the main artery of Zag√≥rze. To honor the guests, local authorities adorned the street and buildings along it with flowers. Edward Jaros had several kilograms of ammonite ‚Äì explosive used for mining purposes ‚Äì six hundred detonators, and 24 rings of mining fuses, which he had stolen from a coal mine in Upper Silesia.Zamach na W≈Çadys≈Çawa Gomu≈Çkƒô, portal polska.pl He placed the bomb on a lime tree, next to a Communist Police station. However, upon seeing crowds of people he hesitated, anticipating that the explosion would cause widespread destruction. Finally, the time bomb constructed by Jaros exploded at 3 pm, two hours before the arrival of the officials. The report of the investigation stated: \\"In the hours close to the planned arrival of the motorcade, a time bomb, planted on a tree exploded. There is no doubt that the target of the attempt was to kill members of the delegation. As a result of the explosion, the tree was partly destroyed, windows in several houses broke, and one person was slightly injured by shrapnel\\". Gomu≈Çka did not tell Khrushchev anything about the assassination attempt in an attempt to hide it from him. The Soviet leader, however, found out about the event, most likely from KGB agents in Poland, and was annoyed with the Polish leader.  Second assassination attempt of Gomulka  Jaros' second attempt took place on December 3, 1961, during Gomu≈Çka's visit to Sosnowiec. This time, the leader of Polish Communist party came to the city to honor local coal miners, who every year on December 4 celebrate Saint Barbara‚Äôs Day (patron of coal miners), known in Poland as Barb√≥rka.Miners' Day or St. Barbara Day (Barborka) ‚Äì December 4. Written by Jagoda Urban-Klaehn Tuesday, December 3, 2002 Like in 1959, the schedule of the visit was published by ‚ÄúTrybuna Robotnicza‚Äù, on December 1. Gomu≈Çka, together with other officials, planned to participate in the opening of a brand new ‚ÄúPorƒÖbka‚Äù coal mine, and Jaros most likely began preparations for the assassination in the fall of 1961, two months before the visit. The would-be assassin appeared on the chosen location in the morning of December 3, but, like in 1959, he saw that there were too many people along Krakowska Street, so he decided to postpone the explosion until the delegation came back from the opening of the mine. After waiting for a few hours, he saw a few vehicles, and came to conclusion it was Gomu≈Çka's motorcade. Jaros detonated the bomb, not knowing that Gomu≈Çka still was at the coal mine, and as a result of the explosion, two innocent people were injured. ‚ÄúAt about 12:06 pm, a motorcade consisting, among others, of three limousines, entered Krakowska Street. When all cars passed a house number 47, a bomb exploded, hidden in a kilometer post. Two people were injured ‚Äì a girl, who was walking past, and a miner, who was returning from celebrations. Shrapnels also destroyed one of the limousines, but not the one with Gomulka‚Äù ‚Äì wrote Adam Dziuba, historian of Katowice office of the Institute of National Remembrance. The girl was partially paralysed, and the miner later died in hospital.  Investigation  Franciszek Szlachcic, who at that time was chief of security services office in Katowice, almost lost his job for failure to provide adequate security. Szlachcic himself, together with Edward Gierek, were for a while among suspects, as W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka believed they wanted to get rid of him to take his post. Detectives, examining the bomb, established that the person who constructed it, was knowledgeable in electromechanics, had access to explosives, and was a local resident. A list of suspects was created, and the investigation was codenamed Antena. Special operational groups of secret services agents investigated suspects, which resulted in creation of a new list of 71 names, including Jaros. On December 20, their houses were searched. During a search at Jaros‚Äô house, tools and explosives were found, which, as was later established, fitted with traces left on the bomb's cord. After arrest, Jaros was first placed in a jail in Bƒôdzin, and then was transferred to Central Prison in Katowice, where his cell was bugged. Together with him, S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa placed in the cell a secret agent, who posed as an inmate, and whose task was to cajole Jaros into talking. On January 7, 1962, during a conversation with the agent, Jaros admitted to constructing a bomb, which exploded on December 3. Furthermore, he added that the attempt was politically motivated and that he had been handling explosives for a long time. Jaros said that in the late 1950s, he read a book titled \\"Last assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler‚Äù, and it gave him inspiration to organize an attempt to kill both Polish and Soviet leaders.  Trial and execution  Both investigation and trial, which took place in Provincial Court in Katowice, were classified. The trial was relatively short ‚Äì it lasted from May 9 to May 25, 1962. For an attempt to kill top Polish and Soviet officials, Stanis≈Çaw Jaros was sentenced to death and hanged on January 5, 1963. No news of either attempt leaked to the West, and public opinion of Poland did not know anything about Jaros, either.

Initially released in 2009 it was introduced as the world's first dynamic rhyming dictionary with 30 different rhyme types, 300,000 entries and more than 9 million phonetic references. One of the software's main features is an intelligent rhyme algorithm that enables users to find near rhymes, also referred to as half or slant rhymes, by adjusting the similarity in sound between the search word and prospective rhyme mates.  Rhyme types  Rhyme Genie can find 26 traditional types of rhymes, 2 phonetic algorithms (Metaphone, Soundex) and 2 proprietary rhyme algorithms (Related Rhyme, Intelligent Rhyme) to offer a total of 30 different rhyme types: Additive Rhyme, Alliteration, Amphisbaenic Rhyme, Apocopated Rhyme, Assonance, Broken Rhyme, Consonance, Diminished Rhyme, Double Assonance, Double Consonance, Elided Rhyme, Family Rhyme, Feminine Pararhyme, Final Syllable Rhyme, First Syllable Rhyme, Full Assonance, Full Consonance, Half Double Rhyme, Homophone, Intelligent Rhyme, Light Rhyme, Metaphone, Pararhyme, Perfect Rhyme, Related Rhyme, Reverse Rhyme, Rich Rhyme, Soundex, Trailing Rhyme, Weakened Rhyme  Development history  Rhyme Genie 1.0 was released in September 2009 to introduce the first generation of the intelligent rhyme and an integrated thesaurus with 2.5 million synonyms. Further incremental updates have added support for heteronyms, a wordfilter with over 100,000 parts of speech and a redesigned multi-syllabic option that allows the intelligent rhyme to automatically switch to monosyllabic rhymes whenever a search word does not produce rhyme mates that match two or more syllables. Rhyme Genie 2.0 was released in May 2010 to introduce a selectable songwriter dictionary compiled from more than 100 million words in over 600,000 song lyrics. An updated intelligent rhyme algorithm now distinguishes between primary and secondary stress in words to find more near rhymes with greater accuracy. Rhyme Genie 3.0 was released in January 2011 to introduce a thesaurus that not only matches the meaning but also the number of syllables of words. Rhyme Genie 4.0 was released in January 2012 to introduce a new accompanying songwriting software named TuneSmith that is able to run the Mac version of the rhyming dictionary as a plug-in. Developed by Idolumic, TuneSmith includes an advanced lyrics editor, a copyright tracker and a pitch journal to assist songwriters in the creation and administration of their songs. TuneSmith's copyright tracker enables users to track the writer and publisher portions of copyright splits and oversee copyright registrations of added songs. An integrated audio recorder can capture melodies or maintain commercially released studio recordings in AIFF, WAVE or MP3. In addition, a pitch journal allows songwriters to track hold periods, release dates and chart positions of pitched songs.

In cricket, Harrison was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium. The son of Ernest Redford Harrison, he was born at Chichester, Sussex, and educated at Harrow School. Harrison made his first-class debut for Sussex against Worcestershire in the 1946 County Championship, having played for the county during wartime matches. He made eight further first-class appearances for the county in that season, before playing his final first-class match the following season against Cambridge University, in what was his only appearance in that season. Predominantly a bowler who \\"bowled with indefatigable persistency\\", Harrison usually bowled with the new ball and took 17 wickets in his ten first-class matches, which came at an average of 29.29, with best figures of 2/28. With the bat, he scored 120 runs at a batting average of 10.00, with a high score of 23. Following his brief playing career, Harrison served as the chairman of the Sussex cricket committee, having served on the committee itself from the 1940s. He played for the wandering cricket club the Sussex Martlets, where he was their secretary from 1950 to 1985 and then president. He subsequently became the vice-president of the Friends of Arundel Castle Cricket Club.

Barney tricks the sea lion into swimming the other way by pretending to throw the anchor in one direction, then throws in another. Only his foot was tied to the rope, which causes Barney to fall in the sea, but the sea lion saves him. A fish is stuck in Barney's suit, in which the sea lion, in an attempt to catch the fish with a trident, pokes Barney's backside. The fish gets out of Barney's suit, lands back in the water and the sea lion aides Barney in catching it. After chasing it into a cave, the sea lion unsuccessfully tries to warn Barney of an oncoming shark, but Barney dismisses his warning, instead he shoos it away. The sea lion came back, trying to warn him again, but eventually flees after seeing the shark is coming and leaving the unnoticed bear alone. The shark pulls up behind Barney, bumping his bottom to face him. Barney, now thinking that is more of the sea lion's goading; he turns around and pokes it with his trident violently.

The sea lion tries to stop it by keeping the jaws open, to which the shark's teeth nibbles Barney in the rear. Barney and the sea lion get back to the boat with the shark in pursuit. The shark uses its fin to saw the boat in half and Barney tries reconnecting it. Using its tail as a propeller, the shark strikes the boat.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 791. Built with weatherboarded walls and covered with a shingled roof, Zion is a Carpenter Gothic structure. Its architectural style distinguishes it among rural mid- nineteenth-century churches in the Connecticut Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio, many of which were Greek Revival buildings without the single tall tower so prominent in Zion's design. At the same time, Zion differs from the typical Carpenter Gothic church in its use of angled gable- shaped windows instead of the ogive traditional in Gothic Revival buildings. Worshippers enter the building though double doors in the base of the tower, above which are placed one large window and one small. A belfry with louvering occupies the highest level of the tower, above which stands a cross-tipped steeple. The roof rises steeply to front and rear gables, with a small section of the roof and much of the front gable being obscured by the tower., Ohio History Connection, 2015. Accessed 2015-12-30. In 1974, Zion Episcopal Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture.

Several years passed before this problem was resolved; some members formed a separate congregation nearby in 1810, and wealthy member Bezaleel Wells donated land at the corner of Fourth and South Streets in Steubenville upon which a church was ready for use by the end of 1811. Epidemics carried away many in 1813, but the numbers continued to swell as revival meetings won numerous converts, and while the new building was complete by 1814, an expansion was necessary as early as 1821. By 1824, the church was larger than any other in Steubenville, but the coming of New Light preachers caused a split, as the newcomers won away many Methodists. Membership stood at 178 in 1830, but 82 members left during the national schism that produced the Methodist Protestant Church in that year, and an epidemic of scarlet fever killed many younger members in the following year. Nevertheless, the congregation eventually began to regain its strength; the members living in northern Steubenville became a separate congregation in 1845, but eleven years later, the original building was replaced with a larger structure that was expanded in 1871. Further church planting was conducted in 1867 and 1870, but by 1910, membership was approximately 650. Consequently, the present building was constructed on the same site in 1914. Orthodox history The earliest members of the Greek Orthodox faith resident in Steubenville had no church building; some were members of the Holy Trinity parish, which worshipped on the upper floors of commercial buildings, while others crossed the Ohio River to Weirton for worship,Parish History, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, n.d.

Mount Pleasant: Arcadia, 2005, 56. The situation changed in 1945, when Holy Trinity bought the former First Methodist building. Architecture Holy Trinity is a composite Neoclassical building; the walls are brick with significant sandstone elements, covered by an asphalt roof and resting on a stone foundation. The main entrance is set in a recessed portico at the center of the facade, accessed by a small flight of steps and sheltered by a colonnade of four Ionic columns. A tall entablature, as high as some of the windows, stands above the columns, while a small pediment sits atop the middle of the entablature. On the side facing South Street, the primary component of the facade is a large gabled section filled with a central arch window and smaller rectangular windows. Corner sections of the building, plus a section extending farther along South, are two stories tall with an exposed basement, and numerous smaller windows pierce the walls on all three floors. A tall square tower, once topped with a cupola, is placed along the South Street side, while a far larger dome covers the central portion of the building., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-23. Recognition In 2006, Holy Trinity Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying because of its historically significant architecture. It is one of eight National Register-listed locations in the city, along with buildings such as the 1900 Carnegie library one block away, the pioneer-era Steubenville Federal Land Office at Fort Steuben, and the Steubenville Commercial Historic District downtown.

Biography Early in life Alger became an iron founder, training in one of his father's three foundries in the Boston area, in Easton, Massachusetts. In 1809, he worked with Thomas Handasyd Perkins, likely tied to Perkins's interest in the Monkton Iron Works in Vergennes, Vermont. Initially Monkton aimed to provide iron to American consumers while the Embargo stymied foreign competition. While the Embargo's end threatened business, the War of 1812 created a new market for Monkton. The company supplied the American government with large numbers of cannon balls as well as iron to join the timbers in constructing frigates. In 1817 Alger incorporated the South Boston Iron Company in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Through his firm's success, the region became a hub for iron manufacturing. Cyrus Alger & Co. No. 20 mortar Alger was one of the best practical metallurgists of his time. His numerous patents of improved processes show a continued advance in the art.

S. ordnance department, The mortar ‚ÄúColumbiad,‚Äù the largest gun of cast iron that had then been made in the United States, was cast under his personal supervision. Alger also devised numerous improvements in the construction of time fuses for bomb shells and grenades. In 1811 he patented a method of making cast-iron chilled rolls, and in 1822 first designed cylinder stoves. Alger served as a member of the city council during the first year of its existence, and was elected alderman in 1824 and 1827. He is buried in Union Cemetery in South Boston.

The port is expected to be developed by the authority as a major new container port in competition with the Port of Melbourne, Australia's busiest container port.  Establishment of the authority  The Port of Hastings Development Authority was established under the Transport Integration Act and commenced operation on 1 January 2012.By virtue of section 2, the commencement provision of the Transport Legislation Amendment (Port of Hastings Development Authority Act) 2011. The Act provides that the object of the agency is to‚Äî * manage and operate the port of Hastings, and * facilitate the development of the port of Hastings as a viable alternative to the port of Melbourne as a container port in order to increase capacity and competition in the container ports sector to accommodate future growth in trade.See Transport Integration Act 2010, section 141S. More broadly, the functions of the authoritySee Transport Integration Act 2010, section 141T. are‚Äî * to plan for the development and operation of the port * to develop or enable and control the development by others of the whole or any part of the port * to manage or enable and control the management by others of the whole or any part of the port * to provide or enable and control the provision by others of, services for the operation of the port * to promote and market the port * to facilitate the integration of infrastructure and logistics systems in the port of Hastings with the transport system and other relevant systems outside the port.  Reasons for establishing the authority  The Port of Hastings Development Authority was established under changes made to the Transport Integration Act, Victoria's central transport statute, by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Port of Hastings Development Authority Act) 2011. The Minister for Ports, the Hon Denis Napthine MLA introduced the legislation into the Victorian Parliament on 1 June 2011. He indicated to the Parliament that the Bill for the Act \\"...sets Melbourne's commercial ports on a path to faster growth through increased capacity and competition in the container ports sector. The Bill establishes a new independent Port of Hastings Development Authority as a key first step in fast-tracking the development of Hastings as a future container port.Hon Denis Napthine MLA, Hansard, Legislative Assembly, Second Reading, 1 June 2011, page 1870. Dr Napthine went on to say that‚Äî ::The authority will complement the Port of Melbourne Corporation in handling the massive growth in trade in Victoria. In addition, a separate container port in Hastings will deliver the benefits of greater competition to Victorian exporters and consumers of imported goods. Increased capacity is needed urgently to cater for the city's rapidly growing container trade, which has a pivotal role in Victoria's and Australia's economy. The government is acting now to ensure that a container port is developed at Hastings within the next 10 to 13 years. ...the required expansion in container port capacity will be best achieved by an independent authority which will ultimately complement the Port of Melbourne Corporation in meeting the state's need for increased port capacity.\\" ::The port of Melbourne is Australia's largest container port, handling around 37 per cent of all container trade. Strong growth in container trade, coupled with the high proportion of containerised freight transported by road, has significantly increased traffic congestion on the roads used by trucks to access the port of Melbourne. By 2035 the Port of Melbourne Corporation forecasts that the port will be handling nearly 8 million 20-foot equivalent units of containers -- nearly four times what it is handling today. This trend has been clear for some years and demands urgent and decisive action. ::This Bill lays the policy and organisational foundations to ensure that the deepwater port at Hastings is given an opportunity to reach its full potential as a competitive container port for Victoria and Australia. The Bill establishes the Port of Hastings Development Authority as a transport corporation under the Transport Integration Act 2010 with the primary object to manage and operate the port of Hastings and facilitate the timely development of the port of Hastings as a viable alternative to the port of Melbourne in order to increase capacity and competition in the container ports sector to manage the expected growth in trade. ::The authority's object, functions and powers are consistent with other corporations established under the act. They include a strong, independent board of directors, corporate powers, and annual report and corporate plan requirements. This charter is similar to the functions and powers of the previous Port of Hastings Corporation but with a clearer object to drive the development of Hastings. ::The Port of Hastings Development Authority is established on the same legal basis as the Port of Melbourne Corporation. Land around the port at Hastings is transferred to the new authority, and responsibility for the port waters at Hastings is returned to the Victorian Regional Channels Authority. This will allow the authority to focus on the land-side development of the port. ::Earlier development of Hastings as a container port will alleviate the pressures associated with Melbourne's burgeoning container trade and make a major contribution to state and national economic growth. It will increase container port capacity, put downward pressure on port charges paid by importers and exporters by increasing competition, minimise future congestion around the port of Melbourne and broaden Victoria's future freight transport options.\\"  Port operations   Day to day management of port and channels  The Port of Hastings Authority administers a Port Management Agreement (Port of Hastings) for the port. The agreement provides that day-to-day operation of the port is contracted out by the authority to Patrick Ports Hastings, a division of Asciano Ltd.See www.portofhastinis.vic.gov.au and www.patrick.com.au/westernport/w1/i1001477/ .

Retrieved 15 January 2012. Around 4 million tonnes of petroleum product is handled annually through the port and around 1.2 million tonnes per annum of steel product.  Environmental considerations  Western Port is as an area that offers significant environmental values that are recognised worldwide. The authority has advised that‚Äî ::\\"The bay is a listed Ramsar site, part of a Biosphere Reserve, containing three Marine National Parks and five Special Management Areas. Western Port covers an area of 680sq km and includes two islands, French Island and Phillip Island, which lie at the centre and entrance of the bay respectively. Approximately 40% of Western Port total area is exposed as mud flats at low tide. The net water flow in Western Port is primarily in a clockwise direction around French Island. The majority of water exchange with Bass Strait is through the western entrance. Water exchange through the eastern entrance is significantly less, mainly due to the great width of the western entrance. ::Freshwater inflow comes via 17 waterways which drain the catchment. The Bunyip, Bass and Lang Lang rivers are the major inflow points which together contribute approximately 75% of the freshwater inflow. The tidal range (up to three metres) within the bay provides a wide variety of marine habitats ranging from deep channels to very extensive sea grass flats, fringing mangroves and saltmarsh and wide tidal mudflats. This variety of marine habitats provides ideal homes for many different species of animals, birds, sponges and corals.\\" ::The environmental values of the area are recognised through the Western Port Ramsar site, specifically its representativeness, flora, fauna and waterbirds. The site is one of 1675 wetland sites, covering 150 million hectares, designated for inclusion in the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance. These form part of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, an intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and appropriate use of wetlands and their resources. :: The Western Port Ramsar site comprises four marine and coastal wetland types recognised under the classification system used by the Ramsar Convention. These are: :: * marine sub-tidal aquatic beds :: * intertidal mud and sand flats :: * intertidal marshes (including saltmarsh) :: * intertidal forested wetlands (including mangroves.\\"  Controversy over management and development of the port  The management and development of the port of Hastings has been a controversial State and local issue for some years. In 2010 before the creation of the Port of Hastings Development Authority, the former Brumby Labor Government conferred responsibility for management and development of the port of Hastings on the Port of Melbourne Corporation at the same time abolishing the former Port of Hastings Corporation, the agency which had previously managed the port for some years. The \\"port corporations\\" at that time - the Port of Melbourne Corporation, the Port of Hastings Corporation and the Victorian Regional Channels Authority - were originally not included in the Government's Transport Integration Act proposal but were added later to that statute by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Ports Integration) Bill 2010 (the Ports Integration Bill).Official version of the Bill available at the Victorian Government legislation web site The Ports Integration Bill was strongly opposed in the Victorian Parliament by the Liberal and National parties, predominantly on competition grounds, and by the Greens for environmental reasons. The Bill was defeated in the upper house of the Victorian Parliament, the Legislative Council, but was later passed due to the use of a dispute resolution procedure under the Victorian Constitution. The Council originally defeated the Bill on 22 June 2010. However, on 24 June 2010 the Legislative Assembly referred the bill to the Dispute Resolution Committee of the Parliament. The Assembly returned the bill to the Council for its agreement as recommended by the Dispute Resolution Committee on 27 July 2010. The Legislative Council ultimately rescinded its resolution defeating the second reading of the Bill and the Bill passed on 12 August 2010. The Ports Integration Bill merged the Port of Melbourne Corporation and the former Port of Hastings Corporation under a rebadged Port of Melbourne Corporation banner. The Ports Integration Bill was ultimately proclaimed to commence on 1 September 2010.Victoria Government Gazette, Special Gazette (no. 337), 24 August 2010, page 1 This formally brought the Port of Melbourne Corporation and the Victorian Regional Channels Authority within the Transport Integration Act framework on that date. These developments were, however, largely reversed by the Transport Legislation Amendment (Port of Hastings Development Authority Act) 2011 which created the current Port of Hastings Development Authority and took away the Port of Melbourne Corporation's responsibilities for the port. The port development remains a controversial issue. It is supported by the State Government but opposed by many others. A Preserve Western Port Action Group is actively contesting State government claims on economic, social and environmental grounds.https://www.facebook.com/PreserveWesternPort Environmental groups are also against the proposed expansion.For example, see Environmental groups warn against port expansion, Danny Morgan, ABC News Australia, 30 June 2011.

Thompson was close to Johnny Adair during Adair's time as leader of the UDA West Belfast Brigade and remained one of the last of the \\"C Company\\" members to support Adair. Thompson was briefly brigadier in West Belfast in 2003 between Adair's imprisonment and his fall.Lister & Jordan, p. 28 Early years A native of Snugville Street in the middle section of the Shankill Road, Thompson's parents ran a sweet shop on the road and the young Jackie Thompson gained his nickname at an early age due to his habit of eating large quantities of his parents' stock. Thompson was a contemporary of Johnny Adair, Sam McCrory, Donald Hodgen and James and Herbie Millar, and along with them was part of a racist skinhead gang that congregated on the Lower Shankill Road and neighbouring Lower Oldpark area in the early 1980s.Wood, pp. 155‚Äì156 The gang officially attended Somerdale School on the Crumlin Road together, although they would frequently play truant and spend their days taking bus rides into the neighbouring countryside where they would drink cider bought under-age by the unusually tall Hodgen. Having become involved in anti-social behaviour the gang, as a unit (by that point around twelve or so members), were co-opted into the local UDA and Thompson and the others were sworn in as members of the West Belfast Brigade's C Company at a ceremony in the Langley Social Club on the Shankill's Tennent Street in 1984. They were assigned to C8, a unit of the company.Lister & Jordan, p. 47 In their early years of membership the gang had little activity of note. A typical incident occurred in 1985 when Thompson, Adair, Hodgen and McCrory were sent to the Pork Produce factory on the nearby Hillview Road to burn their fleet of vans as the local UDA leadership objected to the number of Catholics employed by the company.Lister & Jordan, p. 52 Activity with C8 C8 soon became known as one of the most active units in the company, gaining a reputation for being home to a coterie of young hot bloods who were eager to kill. According to David Lister and Hugh Jordan, Thompson played a central role in the killing of Catholic civilian Eamon Quinn in February 1990. They state that Thompson had fired the initial shots that wounded Quinn before Ken Barrett shot the injured man in the head and stomach, killing him. This was Thompson's first hit, according to the authors.Lister & Jordan, pp. 88‚Äì89 He would soon develop a reputation as a skilled marksman amongst fellow C Company members.Lister & Jordan, p. 100 On 31 July 1990 several members of C Company drove up Lanark Way, which links the Shankill to the Irish nationalist Springfield Road where they shot and killed 34-year-old John Judge as he stood outside his house. According to Lister and Jordan, Thompson, who by this stage weighed 22 stone and as a result had some difficulty fleeing the scene of the crime, had fired the initial shots at Judge before he was killed by James \\"Sham\\" Millar.Lister & Jordan, pp. 85‚Äì86 In the aftermath of the attack Thompson was arrested along with Adair and McCrory although in the event no charges were made for this attack and instead all three were charged with three other failed murder attempts. A lack of evidence saw the case dropped in December of the same year.Wood, p. 157 In July 1992 Thompson was despatched along with McCrory, Tommy Potts and Matthew McCormick as a C Company hit team with the aim of killing Provisional Irish Republican Army commanders Brian Gillen and Martin Lynch in their Andersonstown stronghold. However the security forces had prior intelligence that the attack was due to take place and set up a joint British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary ambush in nearby Finaghy Road North. Thompson and his fellow volunteers came under heavy gunfire before being apprehended. All four men faced prison sentences following the operation.Wood, pp. 162‚Äì163 Thompson pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to murder and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.Lister & Jordan, p. 128 His role as leading hitman in C Company was filled by Stephen McKeag.Lister & Jordan, p. 133 Rise in UDA Thompson was held in the Maze prison and soon became Officer Commanding of 'D' Wing of H7, the area of the prison in which West Belfast UDA prisoners were held.Lister & Jordan, p. 243 Thompson had been released from prison by 2000 when Johnny Adair moved into the Beirut area of the lower Shankill as the two old friends became neighbours.Lister & Jordan, pp. 284‚Äì285 Thompson remained close to Adair who gave him the title of \\"Provost Marshal\\", a role which effectively gave him control over knee-cappings and other acts of extrajudicial punishment in the Shankill area. With the Brigadier's blessing, Thompson even kneecapped Jonathan \\"Mad Pup\\" Adair in August 2002, after the 17-year-old had burgled a local pensioner's house and punched a female worker in a Crumlin Road shop.Lister & Jordan, p. 311 In September of that year Thompson, along with James \\"Sham\\" Millar, accompanied an armed Adair to a meeting of the UDA brigadiers at which he was questioned about his role in the attempted killing of East Belfast brigadier Jim Gray. Adair would be expelled from the UDA soon after this meeting and he declared the West Belfast Brigade fully autonomous.Lister & Jordan, pp. 317‚Äì319 Thompson remained a loyal cohort of Adair's and at his behest led a punishment squad to attack UDA veteran Milton Dodds after he had criticised what he felt was the harsh treatment of his cousin William Mullan, whom Adair had ordered out of Northern Ireland because of alleged links to his rivals the Shoukri brothers. Milton Dodds' brother William \\"Winkie\\" Dodds, one of Adair's oldest allies, moved to the Whitewell Road and placed himself under the protection of the UDA South East Antrim Brigade in response to Thompson's attack on his brother.Lister & Jordan, p. 323 As an all-out war with the rest of the UDA loomed, Johnny Adair was returned to prison on 10 January 2003 and he appointed Thompson as brigadier in his stead.Lister & Jordan, p. 327 Under Adair's instruction, Thompson linked up with McCrory and the two planned to kill Adair's rival, the South East Antrim Brigadier John Gregg. Gregg was killed, albeit by two young gunmen using Thompson and McCrory's plans, on 1 February. The mainstream UDA under Jackie McDonald prepared to launch an assault on the lower Shankill and Thompson heard rumours that this was to happen. Fearing what might result from the attack he followed a number of other C Company members in fleeing the Shankill on 4 February to go to Scotland.Lister & Jordan, p. 330 McDonald's men arrived the following day, forcibly removing those left of Adair's supporters. Adair would later claim that Thompson had appointed himself brigadier and denounced him and Donald Hodgen as \\"the cowards at the top\\" for their refusal to remain on the Shankill and confront McDonald's men.Johnny Adair and Graham McKendry, Mad Dog, John Blake, 2007, p. 223 Life in Britain Thompson was detained by police at Cairnryan for a while after he was found to be in possession of ¬£7,000 in cash, the takings from a sandwich shop he had just opened with Millar and the contents of a slot machine in the \\"Big Brother House\\", a community centre used by Adair and C Company as a base.Lister & Jordan, p. 331 Eventually released, he made his way to Bolton where Adair had connections with local Combat 18 activists.Lister & Jordan, p. 333 With the West Belfast Brigade having been brought back into the UDA fold Mo Courtney was confirmed as Thompson's successor as Brigadier.Lister & Jordan, p. 335 In December 2003 Thompson was targeted by a car bomb and, although the detonator went off as he drove away from his home, the bomb placed under the driver's seat failed to explode and he survived the attack.'Fat Jackie' was 'car bomb' target, Manchester Evening News, 18 December 2003 Stanley Curry of Yardley, who was said to belong to the \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters West Midlands and Midlands Brigade\\" was charged with the attack soon afterwards.Terrorist WhoLived Next Door, Birmingham Mail, 30 June 2005 Curry, a train driver, was given a twenty-year prison sentence for the attempted bombing.Terrorist train driver jailed for 20 years, Birmingham Post, 30 June 2005 Adair's supporters had a series of quarrels in Bolton and by 2004 Thompson was reported to be working for ¬£8 an hour on a building site in Manchester.UDA Bolton Gang split, Sunday People By this stage Thompson and \\"Sham\\" Millar, who were brothers-in-law, had already quarrelled with Gary \\"Smickers\\" Smyth, resulting in their former C Company comrade severing ties to the so-called \\"Bolton wanderers\\" and relocating to Scotland.Adair's Man Setting Up Drugs Empire Rumours circulated in 2005 that Thompson and Millar had beaten up Adair in England after a falling out and, whilst Adair denied the rumours, he dismissed the pair as \\"bullies\\", suggesting that their friendship was over.\\"Adair in hiding?

As of January 5, 2013, with 66,500 bicycles operating from 2,700 stations, it was the largest bike sharing system in the world, although it has since been overtaken by a number of dockless bike share operators such as Mobike. It is the first bike-sharing system in China. It plans to expand to 175,000 bikes by 2020. Due to growing motorized traffic congestion and concerns over the environment, the Hangzhou Public Transport Corporation launched bike-sharing on May 1, 2008, initially starting with 2,800 bicycles, 30 fixed stations, and 30 mobile stations (stations which can be moved to meet demand). In March 2011, it had 60,600 bicycles, and 2,416 stations. In The Hangzhou government invested 180 million yuan ($26.35 million) to launch the program, and 270 million yuan ($39.53 million) in discounted loans. Goals The purpose of the Hangzhou bike-sharing system is to provide a free public bike system network for residents and tourists; the bikes act as a feeder into its public transit network. Hangzhou bike-sharing uses the concept of the last mile (or the last kilometer) to make sure that users can easily get from public transit stops to their destinations through bikes to complete their journey. Hangzhou bike sharing station adjacent to West Lake Technology and pricing Bike release/lock panels Hangzhou Public Bicycle uses smart-card technology, automated check in and check out, and distinguishable bicycle docking stations. For the smart-card, the system requires an initial 200 yuan ($30) deposit for bike-sharing use. Hangzhou Public Bicycle has real-time information tracking current usage of bike-docking station, or a redistribution strategy to ensure all bicycle docking stations meet proper demand. For the first hour, users can ride for free; at the second hour, a user has to pay an additional 1 yuan ($0.15); at the third hour, the user has to pay an additional 2 yuan ($0.30), and any additional hours cost 3 yuan/hr ($0.44/hr). Users pay for the duration of time a bike has been checked in and checked out of a station, so it is possible for a user to ride around the entire city for free. The public bikes were initially available from 6am to 9pm. However, as of September 2015, the time for borrowing a bike has been extended to midnight. On October 2010, a smartphone app called Palm Hangzhou, which tells bikeshare users how many bicycles each bike-share station has, was released by third party developer Zhang Guangyu. However, despite popularity among users, Hangzhou Public Bicycle accused Zhang of illegally obtaining the bikeshare data. As of March 2012, the app does not work anymore as Zhang's IP address was blocked from using the data for the app. Early adoption and behavioral response A survey of Hangzhou Public Bicycle members and non- members was implemented between January 2010 and March 2010 in order to examine the impacts of this service on travel behavior and to gain an early understanding of adoption and behavioral response. The study found that 30% of Hangzhou bikeshare users incorporated bikesharing into their most common commute. Furthermore, the bikeshare system captured modal share from bus transit, walking, autos, and taxis. Another key finding in this study suggests that car ownership may not reduce the likelihood of bikesharing use. In fact, members of the Hangzhou system exhibited a higher rate of auto ownership in comparison to non-members References External links * Hangzhou Public Bicycle Official Website * How to rent a free bicycle in Hangzhou - www.hicenter.cn * AlJazeera English: China city banking on bikes * StreetsFilms: The Biggest, Baddest Bike-Share in the World: Hangzhou China * https://www.wired.com/story/photo-of-the-week-a-dizzying-view-of-a-bicycle- graveyard-in-china/ Category:Community bicycle programs Category:2008 establishments in China Category:Transport in Zhejiang Category:Cycling in China ","title":"Hangzhou Public Bicycle"},{"id":"34381946","text":"Sir Lancelot Oliphant, KCMG, CB (8 October 18812 October 1965) was a British diplomat, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Belgium, Minister- Plenipotentiary to Luxembourg and Director General of the Foreign Office. His decision that Britain would neither join nor fund a joint partnership with Saudi Arabia to explore for oil, thus forcing the Saudis to cooperate with the United States, left him with the unwanted sobriquet The diplomat who said 'No' to Saudi oil. Family background Lancelot Oliphant was the youngest of three sons of Arthur Craigie Oliphant and Agnes Mary, daughter of Rear Admiral William Horton and grand daughter of Admiral Joshua Sydney Horton. Sir Lancelot's grandfather was Col. James Oliphant, Chairman of the East India Company, who in turn was the younger brother of Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie, Member of Parliament for Perth.Burke's Landed Gentry; 19th edition, The Kingdom in ScotlandBurke‚Äôs Peerage & Baronetage; 107th edition Lancelot was married to Christine McRae Sinclair. She had previously been married to Victor Albert Francis Charles Spencer, 1st Viscount Churchill (1864‚Äì1934). One of Sir Lancelot's brothers was Rear Admiral Laurence Richard Oliphant, who was married to the Hon. Adelaide Daphne Hermione Willoughby, daughter of the 10th Baron Middleton, who are the grandparents of the present (34th) Chief of the Oliphants. Lancelot was educated privately. Career Lancelot joined the Foreign Office on 25 August 1903 as a clerk. He passed the examination second out of sixteen. In September 1905 he was appointed third Secretary in Constantinople. In August 1906 Lancelot returned to the Foreign Office and worked in the eastern department. Between March, 1909 and October 1911 he was third Secretary in Tehran. He subsequently returned to the eastern department at the Foreign Office. During the First World War Oliphant worked in the War Office department, dealing with political affairs. After World War 1 he was assistant secretary in the Foreign Office's central department, and acting counsellor from December 1920. In September 1923 he was promoted to counsellor and returned to the eastern department. In February 1928 Oliphant was promoted to acting assistant under-secretary of state and then in April 1929, to substantive under-secretary of state. Around 9/10 May 1932 Oliphant made the decision that subsequently earned him the sobriquet The diplomat who said 'No' to Saudi oil. He received Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the son of King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, at the Foreign Office in London. At that time, Saudi Arabia was an impoverished state with no known oil reserves. The Prince's adviser requested a loan of ¬£500,000 to explore and develop the Saudi oil industry. Although an American had produced a report on Arabia's potential oil wealth, Ibn Saud \\"always preferred to deal with the British, and would welcome the assistance of British firms in exploiting the mineral resources of his country\\". Oliphant replied that \\"British firms might hesitate to accept a report not drawn up by a British expert\\", and expressed doubt \\"as to the readiness of British firms to sink capital in a little-known country at the present time\\". As a result of Oliphant's refusal the Saudis developed ties with the United States, and on 31 May an American team struck oil.BBC News, 8 November 2014, The diplomat who said 'No' to Saudi oil In March 1936 Oliphant was promoted to deputy under-secretary of state (which lasted until 1939). From 1908 to 1939 Oliphant was linked either directly or indirectly with Persian affairs. Even when he was transferred to the central department, Persia had to be declared part of Central Europe so that he could continue to be involved. In his capacity of deputy under secretary of state in the run-up to the Second World War, Oliphant was at the centre of the political activity when Lord Halifax and Neville Chamberlain were trying to negotiate a peace agreement with Adolf Hitler. Lancelot Oliphant was appointed Ambassador to Brussels and Minister-Plenipotentiary to Luxembourg in December 1939. He was interned by the Nazis between 1940 and 1941. He then returned to Britain where he continued his ambassadorial duties to the exiled Governments of Belgium and Luxembourg. Oliphant retired as ambassador in September 1944 and in November of the same year, retired from the Foreign Office.

It is freely inspired by the Spanish novels Lazarillo de Tormes and Guzman de Alfarache. The film was co- produced with Spain, where it was released as Los alegres p√≠caros. Plot I picari was the last of Monicelli's films, such as L'armata Brancaleone, to be set in the Renaissance and medieval eras. As in his previous films, a tilting of the society and surroundings of the characters makes the film a parody of the goliardic lifestyle of the 12th or 13th century. In 17th-century Spain, vagrants Lazarillo and Guzman meet as slaves on a ship. Both had a troubled and difficult childhood because of their parents. The first was adopted by a prostitute and a blind wanderer (Nino Manfredi) who earned a living by cheating and stealing. The second was beaten and scourged. Escaping from the ship in which they were held captive, Lazarillo and Guzman stop at a strange place where they cheat a blacksmith. Later, disguised as gentleman, they are hosted by an impoverished nobleman (Vittorio Gassman). The two tramps, who hoped to make a fortune by entering the service of a nobleman, are shocked by his poor quarters and dire living conditions. Lazarillo and Guzman then become part of a theater company, scrape together some money, buy a prostitute, and encounter a gang of criminals. One of them kills a king's guard and is sentenced to death. His friend saves him by replacing him with another prisoner.

The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2012 to generally positive reviews. The film was released on May 3, 2013, in a limited release. Plot In 1991, a young Jeff Buckley rehearses for his public singing debut at a Brooklyn tribute show for his father, the late folk singer Tim Buckley. Struggling with the legacy of a man he barely knew, Jeff forms a friendship with an enigmatic young woman Allie, working at the show and begins to discover the powerful potential of his own musical voice.

Cranston, 840 F. Supp. 2d 507 (D.R.I. 2012), was a case where the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island ruled that a \\"School Prayer\\" banner posted in Cranston High School West was a violation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution and ordered its removal. The suit was brought by Mark Ahlquist on behalf of his minor daughter Jessica Ahlquist, a student at the school, with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union. Banner When Cranston High School West was opened in 1959, its student council was charged with selection of a school prayer along with its school creed, colors, and mascot. The prayer, adopted in 1960, replaced the Lord's Prayer in daily recitation until 1962, following the United States Supreme Court ruling in Engel v. Vitale. Banners bearing both the school creed and prayer were gifts from the school's first graduating class (1963), and were affixed in the school auditorium. The text of the prayer reads: Plaintiffs Jessica Ahlquist was born in 1995, and lives in Cranston, Rhode Island. Her father, Mark Ahlquist, was co-plaintiff as parent, guardian, and next friend. Lawsuit In July 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sent a letter to Cranston School District superintendent on behalf of an unnamed parent who complained about the banner. Initially, school officials thought the banner could be modified, avoiding the prohibitive expense of a lawsuit. Ahlquist had noticed the banner in her first year in high school. After reading about the complaint, she decided to sit in on the school board meetings. She also created a Facebook page to raise support for the cause. At an August 2010 meeting of the Cranston School Committee, a subcommittee was asked to make recommendations about the disposition of the banner; Ahlquist attended the public meetings of the subcommittee in November 2010 and February 2011. At the end of the November meeting, out of safety concerns, a police escort was provided for Ahlquist and one other person who spoke in favor of the banner's removal. At a contentious meeting of the full committee, she argued the case for the removal of the banner and a similar display at Bain Middle School. The committee voted 4‚Äì3 in favor of keeping the banner in place, despite a budget deficit and the threat of an ACLU lawsuit. The Rhode Island chapter of the ACLU asked Ahlquist if she would serve as a plaintiff in a lawsuit. The suit was filed in April 2011.American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU Files Suit Over Cranston School Prayer Banner 4th April, 2011 The Cranston School Committee had made defense arrangements with Joseph V. Cavanagh, Jr. and The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which represented them without charge. District Court Judge Ronald R. Lagueux issued a decision in favor of Ahlquist on January 11, 2012. The decision was in part based on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, and the United States Supreme Court's earlier rulings in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), Lynch v. Donnelly (1984), and Lee v. Weisman (1992), all three of which had a local Rhode Island component: the Lee case was from nearby Providence, the Lynch case was from Pawtucket bordering Providence on the opposite side from Cranston, and the Lemon case was consolidated at the appeals level from both Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Aftermath At the hearing, Lagueux remarked that Ahlquist \\"is clearly an articulate and courageous young woman, who took a brave stand, particularly in light of the hostile response she has received from her community\\". Following the ruling on the case, police involvement has increased, both escorting Ahlquist to classes and investigating threats, mostly originating in Cranston. An unnamed student was disciplined by the school because of threats. Local florists also refused a delivery to Ahlquist. Two high school students from other states have described their objections to school prayer as inspired by her activism. Religious leaders from the Rhode Island State Council of Churches rallied to defend Ahlquist and condemn the language used to describe her. The organization's executive minister, Rev. Dr. Donald Anderson attended Cranston West when the banner went up; he supported Lagueux's decision. On the day following the ruling, Rhode Island State Representative Peter G. Palumbo spoke on a local radio show and referred to Ahlquist as \\"an evil little thing\\". While the supporters of the banner raised funds for the preservation of the banner in the event of its ordered removal by selling T-shirts with the banner's full text, Ahlquist's supporters raised funds with \\"Evil little thing\\" T-shirts, the proceeds going to a college education fund established for her. On February 16, 2012, the Cranston School Committee decided not to appeal by a 5‚Äì2 vote. The banner was removed, intact, during the first weekend in March, and the school and city agreed to pay the ACLU $150,000 in legal fees. On the day of the agreement, a group consisting of three students, three alumni, and a North Providence resident filed a motion to stay. The motion was dismissed on the basis of being untimely and that they lacked standing. The group filed a notice of appeal over the ruling barring their intervention. Of the seven appellants, four had not signed the notice of appeal, and mail sent by the First Circuit Court of Appeals to a fifth appellant's address was returned as undeliverable with no forwarding address.Ahlquist v. Mesagno, et al, no. 12-1614 (1st Cir. filed May 21, 2012), order, Sep. 20 2012; retrieved from PACER, October 22, 2012 While various parties remained interested in acquiring the banner a year after the case had been decided, the banner remained in storage. In September 2013, an alumni group presented a new mural to the school containing the school's creed.

The Gravesend Cricket Club continues to play at the Bat and Ball Ground which has itself been around for over 150 years (since 1848). First Class Cricket was played at \\"The Bat\\" (as it is affectionately known) by Kent County Cricket Club and its Second XI. The highest ever score on the ground came from W.G.Grace with 257 for Gloucestershire in 1895, and the most wickets in a match coming from Tich Freeman for Kent in 1931. The club currently has four running league teams, as well as a 5th XI which play friendly matches. Also, the club operates an exciting youth section with teams ranging from U10 to U19. In Autumn 2011, the club was awarded the ECB \\"Clubmark\\" status which acknowledges the colts section of the club.  Cricket Grounds used by Gravesend Cricket Club  There are three different grounds that are used every week during the season by the four operating league sides, whilst the Fifth XI play all of their games away, apart from one game which is annually played at the Bat and Ball against Detling CC. These grounds are: * Bat and Ball Ground - Played on alternatively by the First XI and Second XI * Wombwell Park - Played on alternatively by the Third and Fourth XI * Nurstead CC - Played on alternatively by the Third and Fourth XI  2010 Season  In the 2010 season, the First XI was pushing for promotion from Division 3 of the Kent Cricket League and after a brilliant season, were promoted as champions. No doubt, the club were very grateful from the help of Jamaica national cricket team player Yannick Elliott who got 37 wickets and 588 runs during the campaign as the club's overseas player.Yannick Elliot Statistics for season 2010. http://gravesend.play-cricket.com/profile/statistics.asp?id=11465640 The rest of the 1st XI were also brilliant during the season altogether (including Yannick Elliott) accumulating 137 wicketsGravesend 1st XI Wickets 2010 Season http://gravesend.play- cricket.com/scoreboard/bowlingstats.asp?fromForm=1&team;=7935&type;=501&ruletype;=6101&seasonID;=23&sortBy;=5&filter;=0 and 2873 runs.Gravesend 1st XI Runs 2010 Season http://gravesend.play- cricket.com/scoreboard/battingstats.asp?fromForm=1&team;=7935&type;=501&ruletype;=6101&seasonID;=23&sortBy;=4&filter;=0 * First XI top league wicket taker 2010 - Charley Nash - 49 * First XI top league runs scorer 2010 - Charley Nash - 625 * Overall top league wicket taker 2010 - Charley Nash - 49 * Overall top league runs scorer 2010 - Charley Nash - 625  2011 Season  The 2011 season was going to show to be a tough season in Division 2 for the First XI. However, the club managed 4 wins in the first 6 games of the season and were comfortably out of the relegation zone, sitting in the top half of the table. Despite this they went on to lose their next 6 games whilst two were abandoned. They avoided relegation by managing to win two out of the last four games and as a result, they finished 7th in the league with 167 points,League standings for the Kent Cricket League Division 2 in the 2011 season http://kcl.play- cricket.com/leaguetables/resultsReport_view.asp?fromForm=1&seasonID;=24&startDay;=&startMonth;=&startYear;=&endDay;=&endMonth;=&endYear;=&divisionid;=823&cupid;= 13 points above the relegation zone. * First XI top league wicket taker 2011 - Dale Clarkson - 21 * First XI top league runs scorer 2011 - Marlon Johnson (overseas player) - 575 * Overall top league wicket taker 2011 - Joshua Hughes - 37 * Overall top league runs scorer 2011 - Marlon Johnson (overseas player) 575http://gravesend.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp Gravesend CC on Play- Cricket Site December 2011 was to prove to be a great month for the club - despite it being during the off season. This was due to the club being granted ¬£43,214 by the Sport England's Olympic Legacy Fund. This money was spent on new outdoor nets, a roller, a bowling machine and a new cover for the club to use at the Bat n Ball. All of these things will contribute massively, no doubt, to the growth of the club as a whole and will pave a better path for the club's up-and-coming youth players. Also, it was great news for the club when they found out that newly appointed Assistant Coach of Essex County Cricket Club, Matthew Walker, would be coaching the winter nets sessions for the club. Matt is an ex-player for the club having played there for 13 years as a youth and adult.  2012 Season  The 2012 season ended up being a good season for the club especially for the 2nd XI who managed to gain promotion to the Kent 2nd XI Division 2. They did it in the last game of the season and were promoted by a single point. Elsewhere in the club, the 1st XI remained in Division 2 of the Kent League, the 3rd XI remained in Division 1A Central of the Kent Regional League, and the 4th XI were relegated from Division 2B West of the Kent Regional League. However, the 4th XI did win in their final game of the season against the Hartley Country CC 5th XI.

Self-hypnosis is also possible, in which a subject listens to a recorded induction or plays the roles of both hypnotist and subject. Traditional techniques James Braid in the nineteenth century saw fixing the eyes on a bright object as the key to hypnotic induction.O. L. Zangwill, 'History of Hypnotism' in R. Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 331; also Yeates (2013). A century later Freud saw fixing the eyes, or listening to a monotonous sound as indirect methods of induction, as opposed to ‚Äúthe direct methods of influence by way of staring or stroking‚ÄùS. Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 12) p. 158-9‚Äîall leading however to the same result, the subject's unconscious concentration on the hypnotist. The swinging watch and intense eye gaze, which are the staples of hypnotic induction in film and television, are not used in reality as both the rapidly changing movements and the simple cliche of their usage would be distracting rather than focusing. List of techniques Here is a short list of the most common hypnotic inductions.Most Common Hypnotic Inductions Explained. Debates Hypnotic induction may be defined as whatever is necessary to get a person into the state of trance ‚Äî i.e., when understood as a state of increased suggestibility, during which critical faculties are reduced, and subjects are more prone to accept the hypnotist's commands and suggestions.Keys To The Mind - How to Hypnotize Anybody and Practice Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy Correctly - by Dr. Richard K Nongard and Nathan Thomas Evidence of changes in brain activity and mental processes have also been associated experimentally with hypnotic inductions.M. R. Nash ed., Oxford Handbook of Hypnotism (2011) p. 387 Theodore X. Barber argued that techniques of hypnotic induction were merely empty-but-popularly- expected rituals, inessential for hypnosis to occur: hypnosis on this view is a process of influence, which is only enhanced (or formalized) through expected cultural rituals.O. L. Zangwill, 'Experimental Hypnosis' in R. Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 330 Oliver Zangwill pointed out in opposition that, while cultural expectations are important in hypnotic induction, seeing hypnosis only as a conscious process of influence fails to account for such phenomena as posthypnotic amnesia or post-hypnotic suggestion.O. L. Zangwill, 'Experimental Hypnosis' in R. Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (1987) p. 330 A recent review stated that induction is important to the process of hypnosis only by reinforcing the idea that the situation that is about to occur is hypnotic in nature. This helps the participant in enhancing his motivation to respond and involvement in imaginative suggestions. Faster methods of hypnotic induction In early hypnotic literature a hypnosis induction was a gradual, drawn-out process. Methods were designed to relax the hypnotic subject into a state of inner focus (during which their imagination would come to the forefront) and the hypnotist would be better able to influence them and help them effect changes at the subconscious level.Time Distortion ‚Äì A Comparison of Hypnotic Induction and Progressive Relaxation Procedures: A Brief Communication - Clement von Kirchenheim & Michael A. Persinger These are still used, notably in hypnotherapy, where the gradual relaxation of a client may be preferred over faster inductions. Generally, a hypnotherapist will use the induction they find most appropriate and effective for each individual client. However, through development of the modern Western understanding of hypnosis, newer and faster methods have been formed. Modern alternatives to the drawn-out muscle relaxation methods include the Elman Induction, introduced by Dave Elman,A. Jain, Clinical and Meditative Hypnotherapy (2006) p. 10 which involves having the subject imagine that their eyes are too relaxed to open, so that the harder that they try to open them, the harder it becomes to open them (otherwise known as a double-bind). The therapist then raises the subject's arm and allows it to drop, to further impress the state of relaxation. Lastly, the therapist has the subject visualize clouds and numbers within those clouds, as they blow away (each number that blows away increases the effect of the trance) until the subject is too tired to think of any more numbers. This process takes several minutes, but has been known to be effective enough to prepare patients for certain types of surgery. However, there are even faster instant hypnosis inductions (such as 'snap' inductions) which employ the principles of shock and surprise. A shock to the nervous system of the subject causes their conscious mind to be temporarily disengaged. During this brief window of distraction the hypnotist quickly intervenes, allowing the subject to enter the state of intense, hyper imagination and inner focus.

It stars Jackson Galaxy, a cat behaviorist by day and a musician by night, who visits the homes of cat owners in order to resolve conflicts or behavior issues between the owners and their cats or between the cats and other pets. Behavioral issues can include attacks by the cats on their owners. Philosophy Jackson Galaxy believes that he can help any \\"problem cat\\"‚Äîprovided that its human guardians follow the advice he provides‚Äîand that most behavioral problems result either from triggers in the cat's environment, medical issues with the animal, or mishandling of the cat by humans. Jackson teaches that cats are territorial, needing spaces within homes to call their own and that they send signals when they no longer desire petting, a condition he refers to as \\"overstimulation.\\" Cats do not like being cornered and lash out when overstimulated. Certain cats (whom he calls \\"tree- dwelling cats\\") behave better when they have access to above-ground perches, and he often instructs owners of such cats to install an above-the-floor walkway with no dead ends, in order to provide these cats with the psychological comfort of escape routes. Jackson does not believe in cats being surgically de-clawed, believing that the animals suffer for it. On episode 5 of season 2, \\"Cat Fight!\\", he said that cats become hyper aware of the weapons they have left, going straight for back claws (if these have not been removed) and teeth, because that's what they have to fight with. Later on in life, they suffer a lot more arthritis. Instead of de-clawing, he encourages owners to provide scratching posts and other designated surfaces that allow the cat to practice its instinctive behavior of scratching and exercising safely, or to use soft claws or vinyl claws which cover the claws rather than having the claws removed. He teaches that there are correct and incorrect ways to pick up a cat and that when cats are picked up incorrectly, they will often injure humans in an attempt to escape. Most cats need exercise to release excess energy in a positive way; toys and play with owners are outlets Jackson encourages. When this is not done, such cats find ways to release energy on their own, which are often undesirable to their owners and/or destructive to the home. In multi-animal situations, Jackson creates barriers in homes to divide the space into areas which the animals can claim as places of their own. He slowly introduces the cat to the other animals in positive situations (such as feeding). Occasionally, Jackson suspects that certain behavioral problems which defy conventional explanation are due to an underlying health problem (such as arthritis), in which case he instructs the owners to take their cat to a veterinarian before continuing efforts at modifying the behavior.

The monument is located in the ancient cemetery of Hebron. The old Jewish cemetery in Hebron, is located to the west of the Tomb of Machpela on a hill and has been used as a Jewish cemetery for hundreds of years, as attested to by Ishtori Haparchi, who noted a Jewish cemetery in the area in 1322. Other sources indicate the cemetery being mentioned in a letter dated to 1290. Among the prominent rabbinical sages and community figures buried in the cemetery include Rabbi Eliyahu de Vidas known as the Reshit Hokhma, Rabbi Abraham Azulai, Rabbi Solomon Adeni, Rabbi Elijah Mizrachi, Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini known as the Sdei Chemed, Rabbi Judah Bibas, Rabbi Haim Rahamim Yosef Franco, Rabbi Hillel Moshe Gelbstein, Rabbi Shimon Menashe Chaikin, and Menucha Rochel Slonim.

A Sith lord with the ability to manipulate life and death, Plagueis is the mentor and murder victim of Palpatine (Darth Sidious). The character is first mentioned in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, in which Palpatine frames his life as a \\"legend\\" to lure Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. Development The character of Darth Plagueis was conceived by George Lucas as early as the first draft of the screenplay for Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, or possibly earlier. The first draft dates from April 2003. Appearances Revenge of the Sith Darth Plagueis is first mentioned in the 2005 Star Wars prequel film Revenge of the Sith, during the opera scene. Chancellor Palpatine, who is secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious, tells Anakin Skywalker about the tragedy of Darth Plagueis \\"The Wise\\". Palpatine explains that Plagueis could use the dark side to prevent death and create life, powers unknown to the Jedi. Palpatine then explains that Plagueis was killed in his sleep by his own apprentice. Later in the film, Palpatine, as Sidious, tempts Anakin to the dark side by promising to use this power to prevent Anakin's pregnant wife Padm√© Amidala from dying, as Anakin has foreseen. Star Wars Legends The character is featured in Star Wars: Darth Plagueis, a Star Wars Legends novel written by James Luceno released on January 10, 2012. The novel covers the later life and machinations of Sith lord Darth Plagueis (real name Hego Damask II), over a roughly fifty- year period pre-dating and culminating concurrently with the climax of The Phantom Menace. The novel details Plagueis' overthrow of his own master Darth Tenebrous; his work as head of a powerful banking consortium on the Muun homeworld; his discovery, recruitment and training of the teenaged Palpatine of Naboo; and the efforts of Plagueis to undermine the Galactic Republic and ensure the dominance of the dark side of The Force. Daryl Thomen of Newsday called Darth Plagueis \\"the best Star Wars publication to date.\\" The Rise of Skywalker novelization Darth Plagueis is mentioned in Rae Carson's novelization of the 2019 film The Rise of Skywalker. In the book, it is revealed that Palpatine had discovered Plagueis's \\"secret to immortality\\", using this knowledge to survive after his death in Return of the Jedi. The novel further explains that Plagueis had attempted to create a powerful connection with Palpatine known as a 'Force dyad', a concept mentioned in the film as occurring naturally between Rey and Ben Solo. Plagueis's inability to use his powers to save himself from death is also detailed in the novelization; Plagueis \\"had not acted fast enough in his own moment of death\\" to prevent Palpatine from killing him. Relationships Mentorship tree Reception Despite never appearing on screen, Darth Plagueis has remained a popular Star Wars character. The quote in which the character is mentioned in Revenge of the Sith has become a popular internet meme. One theory regarding the origins and identity of the sequel trilogy's Supreme Leader Snoke was that he was Darth Plagueis, or a clone of him.

It was written by Aaron Shure and directed by Eric Appel, and guest starred Jack Coleman, Lindsey Broad, and Mark Proksch. The series, presented as if it were a real documentary, depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) returns from jury duty and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) questions him on every detail of his case. However, Jim later comes under fire when Dwight reveals he only served half a day on his single case then took the rest of the week off to spend time with his wife, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), looking after their toddler and new baby, Phillip. Meanwhile, Angela (Angela Kinsey) and the state senator welcome an infant son. \\"Jury Duty\\" marks the first appearance of Fischer since \\"Gettysburg\\", when her character went on maternity leave. \\"Jury Duty\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many reviews noting that the episode was a step in the right direction for the show. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Jury Duty\\" drew 5.31 million viewers and received a 2.8 rating/7% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a 10% drop in ratings from the previous episode, \\"Pool Party\\". Despite this, it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) returns from jury duty and learns that, in his week-long absence, his co-workers were forced to pick up the slack his prolonged and unanticipated absence created. Jim reveals to the camera that, while he was called for duty, he was dismissed at noon on the first day and headed home to Pam (Jenna Fischer) and their two children; he saw that Pam was overwhelmed and took the rest of the week off to help take care of their children. He finds that his co-workers suffered various inconveniences covering for him, making him feel guilty. To appease his interested co-workers, Jim fabricates numerous details of his jury duty, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) becomes suspicious when Jim mistakenly refers to a food truck franchise Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) ate at during his jury duty as a \\"restaurant\\". After finding a small inconsistency in Jim's story, Dwight accuses Jim of lying about jury duty and extracts from Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) a promise to fire Jim if he proves he is correct. Ashamed, Jim privately admits the truth to Andy, who insists that they keep the matter a secret so that he will not be held to his promise. However, Dwight increases his attempts to prove Jim's guilt, and Jim finally decides to defy Andy's orders and tell his co-workers the truth rather than wait for Dwight to inevitably expose him. While this angers most of the employees, Dwight is thrilled at the confession and demands that Andy keep his promise to fire Jim. Andy refuses, so Dwight tries to contact Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). To smooth things over, Jim and Pam bring in their children, Cece and Phillip, and present pictures that Cece drew for the co-workers. It becomes clear that Jim and Pam drew the pictures themselves, but before the members of the office can berate the couple, the children begin crying loudly, creating a cacophony that Jim and Pam struggle to control, forcing them to take the children back to the car. Realizing the stress that having young kids causes, the office workers ultimately forgive Jim for his behavior and allow him to leave early to help Pam. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, state senator Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, the baby was born prematurely, but due to the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was conceived before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self- assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, in honor of his covert new family member. Production \\"Jury Duty\\" marked the first episode of The Office to feature Jenna Fischer since \\"Gettysburg.\\" \\"Jury Duty\\" was written by consulting producer Aaron Shure, his sixth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the fifth season. It was directed by Eric Appel, his first directing credit for the series. The episode features a guest appearance from Jack Coleman as Senator Robert Lipton, Angela's husband, who first appeared in the seventh season episode, \\"WUPHF.com\\". The episode marks the first appearance of Jenna Fischer since \\"Gettysburg\\". Due to her pregnancy, she was on maternity leave for four episodes. Her pregnancy was written into the series, with Pam and Jim having their second baby. Unlike the sixth season, there was no episode focusing on the baby's birth; it was instead announced on a blog. According to showrunner Paul Lieberstein, she will come back \\"with very little fanfare\\". The episode also marks the seventh appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season, after she initially appeared in \\"Pam's Replacement\\". The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy getting a friend of his, who starred in the Scranton production of Sweeney Todd, to pretend to be a police officer, only to have Darryl uncover the truth, Dwight telling the camera about a recurring nightmare where he is on trial and all of his co-workers are the members of the jury, and Jim trying to make it up to the office by buying all of the despised black licorice from the vending machines so that the rest of the office has access to the red licorice. However, his plan goes awry and his co- workers make him eat all of the black licorice as punishment. Cultural references Several television shows, movies, and video games were referenced. Andy compares stress to a mayor who decrees it is illegal to dance‚Äîas in the plot of Footloose‚Äîand relieves his stress by dancing to the film's title song. Stanley complains that, after working late for Jim, he was forced to watch Rizzoli & Isles with his wife. Andy refers to Jim as \\"Judge Judy\\" when he asks what his jury case was about. Dwight mentions that Jim once tricked him into believing he had been chosen to appear in the popular police procedural drama NCIS. Kevin tells Angela that he bought her new baby Call of Duty, a popular first-person shooter video game. Reception Ratings \\"Jury Duty\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 2, 2012. This was the first episode to air on Global TV in Canada on its new date, Wednesday, February 1, 2012. In the US, the episode was viewed by an estimated 5.31 million viewers and received a 2.8 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.8% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a 10% drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Pool Party\\". The episode also became the lowest-rated episode of the series to air on Thursday. The episode finished third in its time slot, being beaten by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.6 rating/9% share and the CBS drama Person of Interest which received a 3.3 rating/9% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode beat the Fox drama series The Finder and The CW drama series The Secret Circle. Despite ranking number three, the episode ranked number one in the adults and men 18‚Äì34 time slot. In addition, \\"Jury Duty\\" was the highest-rated NBC television episode of the night. Reviews \\"Jury Duty\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics and was considered by many critics to be a major step in the right direction for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, \\"['Jury Duty'] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell.\\" Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode \\"fun and surprisingly sweet.\\" McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not \\"forget about it like almost every other development this season.\\" New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more \\"tightly written\\". He also complimented Krasinski's \\"understated\\" performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the \\"miming chill pill\\" scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, \\"After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This is one of my favorite episodes I can remember in a long time. Not too plot driven and chock-full of solid comedic writing plus a handful endearing moments that just made me feel good. To get a few of my favorite lines, just keep reading.\\" Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- rating and, although commenting on the lack of stakes for the characters, remarked that, Jury Duty' had a certain confidence to it. It may not have satisfyingly explored Jim‚Äôs character, but it ended with a clear statement of his role as a father, reintroducing Jenna Fischer into the cast and putting a button on that particular story development.\\" However, several critics gave the episode a mixed review. Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"there were definitely some ups and some downs in 'Jury Duty'.\\" However, he did praise the action of several characters, most notably Kevin and Dwight. Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"I truly appreciate the talented writing of Aaron Shure who crafted a genuinely well-structured episode. I guess I just didn‚Äôt feel like Jim‚Äôs story held any actual stakes and Dwight‚Äôs just felt random.\\" References External links *\\"Jury Duty\\" at NBC.com  Category:The Office (American season 8) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Jury Duty (The Office)"},{"id":"34382551","text":"Performance of Il paese dei campanelli Carlo Lombardo dei Baroni Lombardo di San Chirico (Naples, 28 November 1869 ‚Äì Milan, 19 December 1959) known also under the composer-pseudonyms L√©on Bard, Leo Bard, Leblanc and M.

In April 2016, Danube University Krems appointed Ulrike Gu√©rot as Professor for European Policy and the Study of Democracy. She is the head of the Department for European Policy and the Study of Democracy. Education Gu√©rot studied Political Sciences, history and philosophy and got her PhD from University of M√ºnster, Germany, in 1995 with a dissertation on the French Socialist Party and Europe.Ulrike Gu√©rot: Die PS und Europa ‚Äì eine Untersuchung der europapolitischen Pragmatik der franz√∂sischen Sozialisten 1971‚Äì1995. Brockmeyer, Bochum 1996. She also holds a MA in Political Science and International Relations from Sciences Po (the Paris Institute of Political Studies). Career From 1992 to 1995, Gu√©rot worked in Bonn as a parliamentary assistant in the office of Karl Lamers, MP, by then spokesperson of the German Christian Democratic Party for foreign affairs. In this period, she contributed to the so-called \\"Sch√§uble-Lamers\\" paper on core-Europe of 1994. In 1995, she moved to Paris and worked first as a Director of Communication for the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe (AMUE); and then as Charg√©e de Mission for the Paris-based think tank Notre Europe, under the auspices of former President of the EU Commission, Jacques Delors. Then she moved to the US and served from 1998 to 2000 as Assistant Professor at the Paul H. Nitze School for Advanced International Studies in the Department for European Studies of Johns Hopkins University, in Washington, D.C. After her return to Berlin in 2000, Gu√©rot took over the European Studies Unit at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) until 2003 and then moved as Foreign Policy Director to the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund (GMF). From 2007 onwards, Gu√©rot opened and built up the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) and served until 2013 as its first Director. During this time, Ulrike Gu√©rot focused in her numerous publications on various aspects of European integration policies, the process of European constitutionalization and European foreign policy, especially on Franco-German and transatlantic relations. During this time, she established the program \\"Germany in Europe\\" at the ECFR, analyzing the shifts of the German role in the European Union. Within this program, she published two books, firstly What Does Germany Think about Europe? (ed. together with Jacqueline H√©nard) in 2011; and secondly Germany in Europe: A Blog Chronicle of the Euro-Crisis in 2013. In spring 2012, Gu√©rot was Visiting Scholar at the German House of New York University (NYU) and in Fall 2014, she had a guest status at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center. In September 2014, she founded, together with Victoria Kupsch, the European Democracy Lab (EDL), which is attached to the European School of Governance (eusg), Berlin, in order to focus on the future of European Democracy post-euro crisis. The core idea of the Lab is the development of a Res Publica Europeae, a political entity of Europe as a Republic. On this, Ulrike Gu√©rot has widely published, most recently in the annual edition 2014 of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. Ulrike Gu√©rot has sketched out her idea of Europe as a Republic in a speech at the Berlin conference Re:Publica . In the meantime, an English and a Spanish version of this speech have been published on http://www.opendemocracy.net and on http://www.eurozine.com. An Italian and French version are in preparation. The idea of Europe as a Republic was also republished at the Digital Bauhaus Conference for societal design in Weimar 2015 and represented at the Summer Academy 2015 of the respected American Chautauqua Institute. In April 2013, Ulrike Gu√©rot and Austrian novelist Robert Menasse published a \\"Manifesto for a European Republic\\", in which they draw attention to the current tensions and developments of the European Union . Consequently, in this paper they call for the foundation of a European Republic. The Manifesto has been tied to an appeal for a new Europe (#newEurope),[10] which so far has been signed by a variety of European academics, intellectuals, artists and policy makers, such as French star economist Thomas Piketty, Club-of Rome member Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker or professor Gesine Schwan. Simultaneously, Gu√©rot worked with German conceptual artist Valeska Peschke to develop the project \\"Amikejo\\". This artistic interpretation of Europe aims to focus on the idea of European friendship. Since April 2016 Ulrike Gu√©rot heads the Department for European Policy and the Study of Democracy at Donauuniversit√§t Krems. Her first book, ‚ÄûWhy Europe needs to become a Republic! A political utopy‚Äú was published in the same month by Dietz Verlag. In May 2017 her second book ‚ÄûA new civil war: The open Europe and its enemies‚Äú will be published by Ullstein Verlag. Gu√©rot has widely published on European, transatlantic and international affairs in German and European newspapers and she is frequently invited to comment in European media on a range of issues. For her engagement with respect to European integration, she was awarded in 2003 with the French cross of honor, L'Ordre national du M√©rite. In the recent debate on a Greek exit of the Eurozone, she has strongly engaged publicly against a Grexit. In autumn 2013, Gu√©rot was part of the official delegation of the German Federal President Joachim Gauck on his state visit to France. Gu√©rot is further teaching classes at Viadrina European University in Frankfurt/ Oder and Bucerius Law School in Hamburg. She is an honorary board member of the European Professional Group of the Berlin Europa- Union Deutschland. Along with Sebastian Dullien, Gu√©rot has emerged as a critic of ordoliberalism and its role in the Eurozone crisis. Writing in 2012, the authors assert how ordoliberalism is central to the German approach to euro crisis resolution, which has often led to conflicts with other European countries.Dullien, Sebastian; Gu√©rot, Ulrike (2012).

The socialist fraternal kiss was a special form of greeting between socialist leaders. The act demonstrated the special connection that exists between socialist countries, consisting of an embrace, along with a series of three kisses on alternate cheeks. In rare cases, when the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks. The socialist fraternal embrace consists of a series of three deep hugs, alternating between the left and right sides of the body, without kissing. This modified greeting was adopted by Communist leaders in Asia, which lacks a tradition of cheek kissing as greeting. During the Cold War, Communist leaders in Asia consented to receive kisses from Europeans and Cubans, but they themselves omitted the kiss. History This ritual originated in the European practice of cheek kissing as a greeting between family members or close friends. It has also been associated with the Eastern Orthodox Fraternal- or Easter Kiss, which through its entrenchment in the rites of the Orthodox Church carried a substantial strength of expression and so found use in daily life. As a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity, the socialist fraternal kiss was the expression of the pathos and enthusiasm of the emergent Workers' movement between the middle and end of the 19th century. In the years after the October Revolution and the subsequent Communist International, a ritualisation of the so far spontaneous gesture succeeded into an official greeting between Communist comrades. The symbolic reinforcement of the feeling of camaraderie also gained success through the fact that many Communists and Socialists had to make long, arduous and dangerous trips to then the isolated Soviet Russia. That way the much- experienced international Solidarity found expression in stormy embraces and kisses. With the expansion of Communism after World War II, the Soviet Union was no longer isolated as the only Communist country. The fraternal socialist kiss became a ritualised greeting among the leaders of Communist countries. The greeting was also adopted by socialist leaders in the Third World, as well as the leaders of socialist-aligned liberation movements such as the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the African National Congress. Kremlinology Kremlinologists paid attention to whether the fraternal embrace was exchanged between Communist leaders. The omission of the customary embrace indicated a lower level of relations between the two countries. After the Sino-Soviet split, the Chinese refused to embrace their Soviet counterparts or to address them as \\"comrade\\". When Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev tried to embrace Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong on a visit to Beijing in 1959, Mao stepped back to avoid the embrace and offered a handshake instead. Even with the normalization of relations in 1989, the Chinese continued to omit the fraternal embrace when greeting Soviet leaders. This was done to emphasize that Sino-Soviet relations were not returning to the pre-split level of the 1950s; Chinese protocol specifically insisted on \\"handshake, no embrace.\\" Because of its symbolic significance, Communist leaders will often exchange the fraternal embrace even if serious disagreements exist, to avoid giving the public impression that relations are strained. For example, although China and Vietnam dispute the ownership of the Spratly Islands, Chinese and Vietnamese leaders continue to exchange the socialist fraternal embrace. Cheek kissing The socialist fraternal kiss should not be confused with ordinary cheek kissing between world leaders. For example, it is traditional for the President of France to greet world leaders by kissing them on both cheeks. This is not a socialist fraternal kiss because there are only two kisses, and it carries no ideological meaning. It is practiced by Gaullist presidents as well as Socialist presidents. In popular culture The fraternal kiss became famous via Erich Honecker and Leonid Brezhnev, who were photographed exercising the ritual. The photograph became widespread and it was subsequently reproduced into a graffiti painting on the Berlin Wall named My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love.

In 1935 the society became the Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand. Val Sanderson is acknowledged as the founder of Forest and Bird. In 1921, after his return from the First World War, the then Captain Val Sanderson was angered that the Kapiti Island wildlife reserve was unfenced and extensively damaged by cattle, sheep and goats. Sanderson campaigned for better management of Kapiti Island and succeeded in having it re-dedicated as a Wildlife Reserve. After this success, Sanderson held a public meeting in March 1923 which established the Native Bird Protection Society with Sir Thomas Mackenzie as the Society's first President. The New Zealand Forestry League, a forest conservation group already existed but it gradually died out. In 1935 Mackenzie and Sanderson renamed the society the Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand.

She was born in Lower Hutt, Wellington, New Zealand in 1887. Education and artistic training At the age of 16, Scales was sent to Christchurch to attend the Canterbury College School of Art. In 1908 Scales left New Zealand to study painting in England with animal painter William Frank Calderon. In 1911 her Cattle mustering in New Zealand was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Career Scales returned to New Zealand after four years in England and continued to paint and exhibit occasionally. In 1928 her father died, leaving her a small legacy that allowed her to concentrate on painting. Scales travelled again to Europe in 1928, spending time working at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re. Dissatisfied by the teaching at the Academy, Scales travelled to Munich where she attended Hans Hofmann's art school, and over the winter of 1931‚Äì32 studied Hofmann's principles of modernism with Edmund Kinzinger. She returned to New Zealand in 1934. Although Scales continued to paint throughout her life, the first public solo exhibition of her work was not held until 1975, organised by Colin McCahon and the Auckland Art Gallery. Reviewing the exhibition, art historian Neil Rowe wrote in Art New Zealand: > One of the more extraordinary stories in the history of New Zealand art is > that of the rediscovery of eighty-eight-year-old Miss Helen F. V. Scales > (better known as Flora Scales) after a forty years disappearance. Over this > period her importance in a historical context has become considerable. About > a year ago Auckland gallery directors Barry Lett and Kim Wright met Miss > Scales living and painting in Auckland, after having returned unheralded > from the United Kingdom. An exhibition was mounted at Auckland City Art > Gallery last December (incredibly her first one-man show in a public > gallery) and shown recently at the Peter McLeavey Gallery in July. Influence On her return to New Zealand in 1934 Scales met artist Toss Woollaston in Nelson, and allowed him to study her notes from Hoffmann's training. Woollaston later cited the importance of this encounter on the development of his painting in his autobiographical text The far-away hills : a meditation on New Zealand landscape (1960). Rowe writes: > In viewing a representative body of her work (forty- three paintings from > 1939 to 1970) we can see the stylistic influence Miss Scales, and indirectly > Hans Hoffman, had on the young Woollaston, and ultimately on his mature > style. Hans Hoffman has been a seminal influence in post-war American art, > and on the New York school and Jackson Pollock in particular. That his > theories and techniques radically influenced one of our own important > painters is entirely due to Flora Scales. Scales' life and painting has also inspired contemporary German-based New Zealand artist Ruth Buchanan. Buchanan showed a work based on her research into Scales at City Gallery Wellington in 2011-12. Collections Works by Scales are held in the permanent collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library, Auckland Art Gallery, Christchurch Art Gallery, The Dowse Art Museum and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.

Early life Annie Jane Allen was born in Leamington Priors, Warwickshire, England in 1835, the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Dodd and Edward Allen. The family moved to New Zealand in 1861, travelling on the Black Eagle, and became pioneer farmers in the Mount Albert area of Auckland. Within days of her arrival, Annie was asked to teach in Wesleyan Mission schools on the west coast of the Waikato region. Eliza White, who had previously served at the Kawhia Mission, probably was part of her recruitment. Allen set out for Kawhia in November 1861, a difficult journey by bullock dray, canoe and foot which took two weeks. At Kawhia, she assisted Cort Schnackenberg (born 1812) and his wife Amy to save and educate the MƒÅori people. The Inspector of Native Schools praised her work. Amy died of breast cancer in late 1863, and Cort proposed to Annie within months. They were married in Auckland in May 1864. From 1865 to 1872 they had three daughters and two sons. The Waikato War of 1863‚Äì1864 disrupted the mission's work, and a subsequent ban imposed by the MƒÅori King Movement on European travel in the area decided the church authorities to move the mission further north to Raglan. They remained at Raglan until Cort's health failed in 1880. He died on board ship travelling to Auckland. Annie returned to live at her family's farmhouse with her children. Activism National Council of Women at the inaugural meeting in Christchurch in 1896, with Schnackenberg the fourth seated woman from the right (wearing white headgear) Schnackenberg became active in local church affairs, and became a leader of the Pitt Street Methodist Church by 1882. During this time, she would have met Elizabeth Caradus and other women later active in social reform for women. She was a foundation member of the Auckland branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in 1885. From 1889 to 1897, she was the branch president, and from 1891 to 1901 she was also national president. Due to her extensive experience with MƒÅori people and fluency in the language, she became the WCTU national superintendent of Maori work in 1898. She was also on the board of their publication, The White Ribbon. The National Council of Women was formed in 1896. Schnackenberg represented the WCTU at the inaugural meeting in Christchurch, and was appointed a vice-president. When women's suffrage was passed, Schnackenberg chaired a large celebratory public meeting in Auckland on 28 September 1893. A year later, she chaired a second meeting to report on progress made since the first. Schnackenberg took strong moral positions in the defence of women. She advocated that temperance become a part of the school curriculum. She was unsuccessful in this, but the Department of Education did order temperance textbooks, making the teaching of temperance in schools possible. She campaigned for the age of consent to be raised to 21 \\"because it ought never to be possible for a girl or woman to consent to her own ruin\\". She opposed the Contagious Diseases Act of 1869, which allowed prostitutes but not their clients to be detained for inspection and treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases, because it made it safer for men to sin. She also opposed smoking tobacco and tattoos. She gave up presidency of the WCTU in 1901 as her health declined. She became more ill in 1903, and died on 2 May 1905. She was buried beside her husband in Symonds Street Cemetery.

Wilson. It is the first installment in the Ashtown Burials series and follows members of the Smith family, especially siblings Cyrus and Antigone who are new initiates in a secret society of explorers known as the Order of Brendan. The author has stated that his intention was to write a young adult fantasy series whose sensibility and orientation were clearly American, in contrast to the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings fantasy series which are both anchored in an English milieu. And though the novel has some aspects of the occult and supernatural, he also strived to base the series in the physical realm, where the characters are forced to rely on their physical and mental acuity, hoping to motivate readers to be enchanted by \\"the wonder of here and the wonder of now.\\" Interview with NPR, November 10, 2011, https://www.npr.org/2011/11/10/142207375/epic-fantasy-meets-americana-in-the- dragons-tooth (accessed 14 January 2012). The book is full of cultural, historical, and mythological references, such as the dragon's tooth of the title which is a reference to the Dragon's teeth of Greek mythology used by Jason in his quest for the Golden Fleece. Meanwhile, the antagonist of the novel, known as \\"Phoenix,\\" references such classic villains as Dr. Moreau and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Plot summary In Wisconsin, near the shores of Lake Michigan, Cyrus and Antigone Smith run a beat up old motel called The Archer along with their older brother Dan. The motel hardly sees guests, with the exception of Mrs. Eldridge, a full-time occupant. One day a man named William Skelton comes to stay at the motel, giving Cyrus a set of keys along with something resembling a shark tooth saying they will \\"more than pay for the night.\\" That night, the hotel is attacked by strange men, who eventually kill Skelton. Before he dies, he gives Cyrus a \\"patrik,\\" a silver snake which disappears when it puts its tail in its mouth. The next morning, Dan has gone missing. John Horace Lawney, Skelton's attorney, shows up and tells Cyrus and Antigone that Skelton had named them as his heirs. The three are chased by a man named Maxi, who appears to want the keys Cyrus has. While fleeing, Lawney gets shot, but the three make it a place called Ashtown. Ashtown is a large base for the Order of Brendan, a more-than-1000-year-old secret society made up of influential and extraordinary people, who explore and protect the world from evil. Bewildered, Cyrus and Antigone are sworn into the order by Rupert Greeves, a high ranking Ashtown official. It is declared that the two must meet the more rigorous 1914 standards for admission before receiving the contents of Skelton's estate. Mrs. Eldridge, who is an O of B member sent to watch the two by their late father and comatose mother, becomes their mentor. The pair are sent to live in a run down part of Ashtown called the Polygon, where they meet Nolan. Nolan is a boy with \\"ancient eyes\\" who tells the two the history of the O of B, takes them around the estate, and introduces them to Ben Sterling, the kind but mysterious head chef. That night, they are visited by Rupert Greeves who tells them that Dan is in the hands of Dr. Phoenix, an evil mastermind who had been expelled from the O of B. He also informs Cyrus that the keys Skelton gave him are the \\"Solomon Keys\\" and will open any door. Greeves also reveals that he and the pair's father had been good friends, but their friendship was strained after their father brought their mother back from South America, resulting in his expulsion from the O of B. Cyrus uses the Keys to sneak into one of Ashtown's \\"Burials,\\" specialized eternal holding cells for immortal or transmortal criminals. The next day, Ben Sterling tells them the truth about the tooth. It is called the Dragon's Tooth and is an ancient and powerful relic which can supposedly raise the dead and kill the immortal. While searching the grounds, Cyrus and Antigone find \\"Quick Water,\\" a strange gel which, when separated into two balls, allows the holder of one to see the holder of the other. Soon after, Ashtown is attacked by Maxi, intent on reclaiming the Dragon's Tooth for Phoenix, who is his master. Cyrus and Maxi fight and the patrik grows to an enormous size and attacks Maxi, protecting its owner. Cyrus uses the tooth to slay Maxi for good, but not before Maxi had killed Mrs. Eldridge and injured Nolan. It is revealed that Nolan is in fact a transmortal and sheds his skin anytime he is hurt. After the battle, Rupert tells Cyrus and Antigone that he had taken their father on a quest to find the tooth, but Phoenix had gotten there first and was the one who killed their father. Rupert was able to escape, but without their dad's body. Skelton then had betrayed Phoenix and taken the tooth from him, which is how it came to be in his possession before he gave it to Cyrus. Soon after, Cyrus is taken hostage by Ben Sterling, who has been working with Phoenix the whole time. Sterling, as the head cook, poisoned the whole of Ashtown's dinner. In a moment of empathy, however, he leaves an antidote with Cyrus, who is still tied up. Antigone uses the Quick Water and, along with a 16-year-old accomplished member named Diana Boone, rescues Cyrus. With the help of friends, they are able to administer the antidote. Meanwhile, Dr. Phoenix enters Ashtown and tells of his plan to rid the world of humanity and use Ashtown as a nursery for a superior race, one he will be the master of. Cyrus and Antigone, along with the others, confront Phoenix and aggravate him to the point where he changes into Mr. Ashes, a white haired gorilla-like monster. A struggle ensues and Phoenix escapes with the Tooth, though not before the group badly injures his right arm. Cyrus and Antigone rescue their mother, who Phoenix had also been holding hostage, and Dan, whom Phoenix had brought to Ashtown as bargaining chips. Phoenix has operated on Dan and made him a larger, \\"upgraded\\" version of himself. In an epilogue, it is revealed that Phoenix has completely lost his right arm and also holds the body of Cyrus and Antigone's father. Months later, Cyrus and Antigone pass the final tests to become complete members of the O of B. They are eligible to receive the contents of Skelton's estate. A healed Lawney shows the two what Skelton left. Along with money, he left them a map of Mongolia, an apple core, a booklet and an old paper sphere with a map of the world drawn on it, leaving Cyrus and Antigone utterly confused. Transmortals Transmortals are a group of beings appearing in the series. A transmortal is simply an ordinary mortal who somehow becomes immortal. Thus they have transformed from mortal, to immortal. There is no common way to become a transmortal. Some have eaten of the Fruit of Life, or drank of the Fountain of Youth. Others become undying by possessing a powerful object, such as the Odyssian Cloak or Dragon's Tooth. It is also a result of some blessing or curse. Wilson commonly chooses semi- famous people from history and mythology to give this transmortality to. In the first book of the Ashtown Burials, The Dragon's Tooth, Maximilian Robespierre, the leader of the French Revolution, is revealed to be a transmortal. In later books, legendary people like Gilgamesh of Uruk, Arachne, and Captain John Smith are introduced, all being known in the real world, and given transmortality by Wilson. These characters are given a mystical touch possibly derived from the uncertainty of the nature of the historical figures themselves. A common trait among transmortals is grief, which often leads to violence. In truth, the transmortals are tired of living forever. The Order of Brendan will bury the most dangerous of the transmortals, while making power- limiting treaties with others. Many transmortals desire the burials, where they can endure life in sleep. There are few ways to kill transmortals, the Dragon's Tooth being the most famous. Many weapons were made with the charm of the tooth, and can cause pain when used on transmortals, but do not kill unless the Tooth itself is present. Several times, when Cyrus Smith has the Dragon's Tooth, his allied transmortals will plead for him to end their misery. Reception Critical reception to the novel was positive.

Agram originates from Niger and is related to card games in other regions of the world, including Spar or Sipa in Ghana and West Africa, and a variant Sink- Sink. In Cameroon it is called Fapfap. Agram is typically played with two to four people; however, it can be played with up to seven. Agram is an unusual trick game in that the winner of the last trick in the round, wins the round.  Gameplay   Setup  Agram uses the Aces, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 2 of each suit of the deck. The ace of spades is removed from the deck. The ace of spades is commonly referred to as the \\"Chief\\". The remaining 35 cards are shuffled and placed into a deck. Dealing Each player is dealt six cards in two sets of three cards by the dealer.  Trick Winning  The player to the left of the dealer leads with a card of their choice. The player to their left then follows with their card. If possible they must follow suit; however, if they are unable to, they may play a card of any suit. If the card played does not belong to the original suit, it has no value. After this player plays a card the remaining players each play a card, staying in order. The player who has the highest card of the original suit (suit of the leading card of the round) wins the trick. The player who wins the trick leads with a card for the next trick, and play continues to the left of the leader.  Scoring  The player who wins the sixth/final trick wins the round. There is no convention as to how many rounds are played to decide the winner.  Variations   Sink-Sink  Sink-Sink is commonly played in Niger. What distinguishes Sink- Sink from Agram is that each player receives five cards instead of the original six. These cards are dealt in one set of three and another of two.  Agram (Mali)  Agram is played slightly differently in Mali. Only 31 cards are used: the Ace (not Ace of Spades), King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7. Five cards of dealt (same way as Sink-Sink) and the game is played in the same way. However, there is one main difference. The ranking of the cards is very unusual. The ranking is as follows: A, K, 10, Q, 9, 8, J, 7.

Among its activities, the organization has been campaigning for the establishment of a community centre. Zoe Belle Gender Collective was founded in 2007 and is named after the late transgender activist Zoe Belle. www.zbgc.org.au thumb History Since the 1980s, local transgender organizations, such as the group Seahorse Victoria, have sought to establish a state-funded community centre for Victoria's transgender population. Zoe Belle Gender Collective is the most recent attempt to establish such a centre. The organization emerged following a forum on transgender healthcare at Camp Betty, a festival of radical sex and politics that was held 7‚Äì11 June 2007 in Melbourne. The forum began with the \\"premise that we need better healthcare for trans people, more community involvement in healthcare provision from transpeople rather than doctors and 'experts', and that this healthcare should be publicly funded.\\" Following the forum, a group of activists from the local SGD community began a campaign to establish a 'gender centre' for Victoria. Among the group was Zoe Belle, an activist in LGBT rights, women's rights, and other causes. On 15 January 2008, Zoe Belle took her own life. In tribute to Zoe Belle, the group of activists became known as the Zoe Belle Gender Centre Working Group and they named the emerging organization Zoe Belle Gender Centre. On 25 August 2015 the Zoe Belle Gender Centre changing their name to the Zoe Belle Gender Collective to reflect their new mission, vision and objectives. Victoria has changed since ZBGC first formed, and there are many more services and resource for trans and gender diverse people all across the state. To support this momentum, rather than focus our energies on a single physical location, ZBGC will instead support this expanding work across Victoria through our online presence, community events, and work with service providers to better support the trans and gender community, and access to services statewide. Mission The organization's mission statement is: \\"To support and improve the health and wellbeing of people of all genders. We view health holistically to assist, inform, enliven and advocate for our communities.\\" Primary activities Campaign to establish a 'gender centre' for Victoria In the lead-up to the 2010 Victorian State Election, Zoe Belle Gender Collective intensified its lobbying efforts for the establishment of a state-funded gender centre for Victoria. In a 24 October 2010 media release, the organization criticised the Brumby Government's GLBTI- related election promises as \\"(forgetting) the 'T' and 'I'\\". It called upon the Labor Government to work with Zoe Belle Gender Collective to establish a state-funded, community-driven gender centre. During this period, Zoe Belle Gender Collective received public letters of support from the Victorian Greens party and the Australian Sex Party. On 24 November, the Victorian Labor Party issued its own letter of support for Zoe Belle Gender Collective, written by then-Deputy Premier and Attorney-General Rob Hulls. On 27 November, the centre-right Liberal/National Coalition opposition, which had not expressed any support for the organization, won government. Suicide prevention of young transgender and gender diverse people  In December 2011, Zoe Belle Gender Collective was one of seven recipients of a $4 million package from the Baillieu Government to address suicide and self-harm among LGBTI young people. Receiving non-recurrent funding of $146,000 over 4 years, Zoe Belle Gender Collective became what is believed to be the first Victorian transgender organization to receive government funding. Virtual gender centre In August 2010, the organization launched a 'virtual gender centre'. Based at Zoe Belle Gender Collective's official website, the virtual gender centre provides resources for those who are interested in the health and well-being of SGD people. Events The organization runs community events such as workshops and social gatherings.

It is considered part of the Chontal Maya region of the state, known for its production of decorated dried gourds traditionally used for drinking chocolate and cured meats. Although there is some oil production and tourism, its main economic activity is agriculture, producing cacao, coconut and livestock. The city Interior of the San Francisco de As√≠s Church The city of Jalpa de M√©ndez is 35 km from the state capital of Villahermosa with a population of about 13,330. The settlement has its beginnings as a village during the Mayan period. Since early in the colonial period, it has been the seat of government for the surrounding communities. Today, the city is the seat for a municipality of the same name, with the municipal, state and federal government offices principally located here. Its main economic activities are agriculture, livestock, fishing, commerce, services and tourism. The historic center of the city is marked by the Parque Central or Central Park, which is a plaza with gardens with palm, almond and pine trees as well as other ornamental plants. There is a fountain in the center which is shaped as decorated gourd, the typical handcraft of the area. The San Francisco de As√≠s Church is next to the plaza in the center of the city. It was restored recently. The church's facade is Neoclassical made of sandstone flanked by two bell towers. The interior is single nave with two main sections and a cupola in the center of the roof. One of the decorative features of the church is five doves in different colors, which symbolize five continents. In front of the church is a wide atrium with benches, lights and garden areas along with fountain which used to be a baptismal font. The Coronel Gregorio M√©ndez Maga√±a House Museum is the former residence of the leader of Tabasco forces that defeated the French at the Battle of Jahuactal. The house is constructed of brick with a wood roof. Although the structure has been reconstructed several times, it still maintains its original look. In 1984, the building was reopened as a museum with six halls where items such as arms, drawings, photographs, oil paintings, historical documents and the coronel's personal belongings are displayed. The Casa de Cultura or Cultural Center was constructed with an area of 713.12m2 between 1977 and 1982 specifically for its current purpose. It has exhibitions of drawings and painting along with other cultural events and classes, especially on weekends such as karate, guitar, piano, ballet, English, mathematics, modern dance and Mexican folk dance, especially the regional zapateo tabasque√±o. It has an auditorium which is used for conferences and cinema events. Geography and environment Pejalagarto fish Most of the territory is flat with a few low hills with an average altitude of ten meters above sea level. The Nacajuca River forms the municipality's border with Cunduac√°n. The El Naranjo River forms the border with Nacajuca; the Cucuxchapa River forms the border with Para√≠so and the Chiquistero River forms the border with Centla. The lakes cover an area of 2,320 hectares. The important lakes in the area include Pompos√∫, El Eslab√≥n, La Negrita, San Agust√≠n, El Provecho, La Tinaja and El Tronc√≥n. The Pompos√∫ Lake is located in the north of the municipality. The waters are of various shades of green with palm trees surrounding it. Fishing here can yield species such as bass, mojarra, tilapia and pejelagarto. The climate is hot and humid with temperature changes during the year. The average high temperature is 30.5C which occur in June with the coldest temperatures averaging 22.5C which occur in December and January. Average annual rainfall is 1692mm per year but the rainiest month is October with an average of 696mm and only 20mm in April. Relative humidity ranges between 75 and 86% during the year. The windiest months are November and December, when fronts called ‚Äúnortes‚Äù (because they come from the north) enter the state from the Gulf of Mexico. During these times average wind speed is 32 km/hr, higher during storms. The flat terrain and plentiful rainfall makes the area vulnerable to flooding. In addition to the floods of 2007, which covered 80% of the state of Tabasco, other recent major floods include those in 1999 and 2010. The 1999 flood was caused by a release of water from the Penitas hydroelectric dam to ease pressure on it and the 2010 flood was severe enough to warrant intervention by Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights Comisi√≥n Nacional de Derechos Humanos (CNDH). Wildlife includes land and aquatic species such as parrots, macaws, storks, manatees and crocodiles. In wetland areas, there are still wild mangroves. History The name Jalpa comes from the Nahuatl phrase Shal-pan which means place over sand or on the edge of sand. The settlement was one of many small villages that arose during the Mayan period. Hern√°n Cort√©s passed through the area on his way to what is now Honduras. Spanish families began to live in village, then called Xalpa, starting in 1550. The settlement became important during the colonial period and was named capital of the Chontalpa Region. The town was the seat of government for twelve other communities by 1665. The settlement of Comalcalco was created in 1827 in an area controlled by Jalpa and in 1834, this area separated to form what are now the municipalities of Comalcalco and Para√≠so. The modern municipality was established in 1837 by state congress, but the town was not named the seat until 1852. The official name for the municipality of Jalpa was decreed in 1882. In 1887, the name was changed to Jalpa de M√©ndez to honor Gregorio M√©ndez Maga√±a, who fought against the French between 1863 and 1864. Jalpa was declared a city in 1955. Culture The municipality has an annual fair at the end of May at the Parque Club Campestre. It includes cultural, commercial and agricultural exhibits and events. Cultural events are organized with local school and cultural centers. In addition there are handcrafts, regional food, amusement rides, folk dance as the crowning of a ‚ÄúFlor de J√≠cara‚Äù beauty queen. Carnival is an important annual event. It begins in January with the ‚Äúquema de mal humor‚Äù or burning of bad mood using a paper mache figure. From then until Ash Wednesday, there are dances and people with lavish outfits, especially on Sundays accompanied by son music. Traditional dress for women consists of a long, full skirt with flowered patterns and a white cotton blouse with embroidery around the collar. For men, it consists of white cotton pants and shirt with a red handkerchief, a hat called a ‚Äúchontal‚Äù, carrying bag and machete. The local cuisine is distinguished its use of cured meats such as head cheese and longaniza sausage. Sweets include those made from sesame seen and pine nuts and traditional drinks include chorote, pinol and cacaotada. Economy Decorated gourds for sale in Jalpa Thirty five of the sixty four active communities in the municipality or about 54% are considered to have some level of socioeconomic marginalization, with the overall municipality considered to have a medium level of marginalization. The main economic activity of the municipality is still agriculture, with main crops being basic grains, cacao and coconut. Livestock is an important part of the local economy and includes cattle, pigs, sheep, horses and domestic fowl. The area's lakes allow for fishing and aquaculture but it is not a major part of the economy. The Don Remo tobacco farm and cigar factory was established in 1995 in the town of Tierra Adentro. The name is in honor of Remo Loaiza San Vicente who was an important tobacco farmer and father of the current owner of the factory, Alfonso Loaiza Garcia. The current enterprise began with Sumatra tobacco and by 1997 it was cultivating fifty hectares, with a yield of about 1.5 tons per hectares. The factory covers an area of 550m2 to cure the leaves and produce the cigars. While this enterprise is relatively new, the growing of tobacco here dates back to the Mayans. However, the production of tobacco here has been declining due to the difficulty in obtaining supplies, poor crop yield and a declining local market. There have been recent efforts to support tobacco production in the state as part of its culture along with its cuisine. There is no major industry in the municipality except for the Mecoac√°n oil field. Manufacturing is limited to handcrafts and food processing by small family businesses. One known food industry here is the production of cured meats such as head cheese and longaniza sausage. The main local handcraft is the drying and decoration of gourds which were traditionally used for storage and food service, but today are mostly created for tourists. The gourd, called a jicara, is traditional important as a vessel for chocolate. Today, it is still traditional to serve a chocolate drink called pozol in these gourds. The commerce sector of the economy has developed in the last ten years with national chain stores arriving such as Bodega Aurrer√°, Super Che, Soriana and Parisina Telas. Services such as banks, restaurants, auto and pharmacies are mostly for the local populace. There is one traditional municipal market called Daniel Santos Garcia located in the municipal seat. State authorities have initiated programs to promote the area as a tourist attraction such as making it part of the Cacao Route, but local authorities have not yet seen results. However, signage and authorization to create ecotourism centers such as the planned Chontalpa Chica have not yet materialized. The Pompos√∫ Juliva Wetlands are on the delta of the Mezcalpa River. There is some ecotourism such as aquatic sports and excursions as well as a swamp crocodile sanctuary. The Don Remo cigar factory offers tours. The La Encantado turtle farm is the only one of its kind in Latin America, raising six species of turtle native to the state. It is located in Reforma Segunda Secci√≥n. It belongs to the Ol√°n Garc√≠a family. In 2004, the enterprise received the Tabasco State Ecology Prize.

For the 1949 model year, Ford introduced redesigned model lines for all three of its divisions. To share development costs, Ford combined its separate Lincoln and Mercury divisions into the Lincoln-Mercury Division following World War II. As a result, the redesigned postwar Lincoln shared much of its design with the redesigned 1949 Mercury Eight. As with its K-Series and H-Series predecessors, the division marketed the EL-Series using only the Lincoln division name; the Lincoln Cosmopolitan was only the third Lincoln (beyond the Zephyr and Continental) to have a separate model name. In a major departure from division precedent, the EL-Series was the first Lincoln produced without a V12 engine. As a V12 developed for the EL-Series was stillborn, Lincoln utilized a version of the Ford Flathead V8 shared with the Ford F-7 and F-8 conventional trucks.  Model History  1949 The first all-new postwar Lincolns were introduced on April 22, 1948. They had a more streamlined appearance than the 1948 models, reflecting \\"ponton\\" styling. However the new two-piece windshield seemed a bit out of sync with the modern styling. At a distance it was hard to tell a Lincoln apart from a Mercury. Recessed headlights and a shinier front end set it apart. The 337 cubic inch Lincoln flathead V8 produced at 3600 rpm. 1950 1950 Lincoln four-door sedan with suicide doors In 1950 a new horizontal grille with elements enhanced the appearance of the standard Lincoln. Its name was in the same location on the front fender as last year, but it was larger. The doorhandles were improved as was the previously confusing interior layout. The convertible was dropped from the lineup as Mercury's near-identical convertible had outsold it by a wide margin in 1949. On 5 July 1950 the Lincoln Lido was introduced as somewhat of Lincoln's answer to the GM hardtops that had debuted in 1949. List price for the 1950 model was $2721. It was similar to the Mercury Monterey and the up market Lincoln Cosmopolitan Capri coupes, while the Lido was also offered as a sedan with suicide doors for rear seat passengers. Both years of the Lido featured a vinyl or canvas-covered roof, fender skirts, bright roof drip rails and rocker panel moldings, dual door mirrors, a gold-colored hood ornament from the Cosmopolitan and a custom leather interior with special door and side panels. An electric clock was standard.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Lincoln/1951_Lincoln/1951_Lincoln_Foldout/1951%20Lincoln%20Foldout-02-03.html Few were sold, as customers preferred General Motors' hardtop offerings. The Lido name, however, reappeared on a 1963 show car called the Lincoln Continental Lido, which was a 1963 Continental with a padded vinyl roof. Late in the 1950 model year the engine was upgraded to address vibration and oil consumption concerns. Three rather than four piston rings were fitted, and the engine balancing was improved. As a result the horsepower rating increased marginally and the car ran smoother. The cooling system was also improved and durability was increased thanks to the use of more alloy.Howley, p. 60 1951 According to the Standard Catalog of American Cars, the front end of the 1951 Lincoln \\"looked like a 1950 model that had gotten into a fight, and lost.\\" The grille bar only extended from the center section to the bumper guards, while a forward slanting vertical piece was added to the front fender side chrome. The 1951 Mercury's \\"fishtail\\" rear design was also adopted, to the detriment of rearward visibility(*). The glamorous Lido coupe returned with a canvas or vinyl roof, fender skirts, rocker panel molding and custom interior. (*)Other than here, there is no reference to a Mercury \\"fish tail\\" design. The '51 Lincoln's modified C pillar actually increased rearward vision.

He was born in St Albans Abbey, Hertfordshire, England in 1817. Searancke established two families, one MƒÅori and later one Pakeha (English). A granddaughter of Searancke, Te Puea Herangi (also known as Princess Te Puea), became notable as a MƒÅori leader in the early twentieth century. In 1858, he was appointed District Commissioner in the Land Purchase Department in Wellington. He was sent to the Wairarapa. He had 4 children with Hariata Rangitaupua of Ngati Maniapoto. He had become notorious for negotiating secret deals and reneging on his promises. Searancke was exasperated with Wairarapa Maori, calling them unmitigated scoundrels. Searancke saw that Maori were very poor and would eventually sell. In 1858 he bought two large areas of Maori land-the Tupurupuru and Maungaraki blocks for the government.The Canoes of Kupe. R. McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masterton. 2012.pp 74-76. In July 1869 Searanke was the resident magistrate in the Waikato. He was present when the renegade Te Kooti, who had escaped with many Hau Hau prisoners from the Chatham Islands came to Te Kuiti to confront the Maori King Tawhaio. Te Kooti had vowed on his arrival back in Gisborne to replace Tawhaio as Maori king of New Zealand. Searanke reported to the government that Te kooti's presence in the king country appeared to paralyze the Waikato. Te Kooti put the fear of god into them by ordering his 500 men to load their guns and fire over the heads of the approaching Waikato. Te Kooti then ordered them to bring all their greenstone to him which he destroyed. The standoff continued for over a week with Tawhaio refusing to even see Te Kooti who was deliberately snubbed, being forced to camp outside the village on the roadside in contravention of all normal protocol for visitors. From Te Kuiti Searancke travelled with Te Kooti and chief Horonuku, who had spoken out in favour of Te Kooti, to visit Louis Hetet, a French trader who was considered Maniapotos' pakeha. At the meeting Rewi abstained from drinking but Te Kooti got very drunk and talked at length about the reasons for his previous actions but not about his future plans. Searancke warned Te Kooti that his \\"escort\\" would prevent him travelling down the Mokau valley and obliged him to return to Taupo again.

Early life Choie Sew Hoy was the eldest of four sons of Choie Bing Sum, a farmer in the village of Sha Kong (Altar Hill), in the Upper Poon Yu (Panyu) district of Canton (Guangdong) Province, China. Because of war, famine and poverty, some families in Canton Province used their access to the international ports Canton (Guangzhou) and Hong Kong to send young men overseas to work. In the second half of the 19th Century, these men formed a living chain of migrant labourers. They sent money back, guided other family members and, sometimes, returned home relatively wealthy. Following the California gold rush, Choie Sew Hoy was one of thousands of Cantonese who went to Gum San, \\"the gold mountain\\" of California. When the rush to Dai Gum San, the \\"big new gold mountain\\" of Australia, began, Choie Sew Hoy went to the goldfields of Victoria, but he took part in the Victorian gold rush as a merchant rather than a miner. In 1865 the Otago Provincial Council invited Chinese miners in Victoria to come to the Otago goldfields, and Choie Sew Hoy moved his enterprise to New Zealand in 1869.'Memorial of Mr Sew Hoy' 1873/2576 NZ Archives, Wellington (included in R 24939652 ACGO 8333 IA1 719[28] 1897/929) Career as a merchant In 1869, Choie Sew Hoy set up his business in Dunedin providing Chinese miners in Central Otago with supplies and equipment and also acting as a wholesale supplier to Chinese shopkeepers on the goldfields. His combined store and warehouse was in Stafford Street, not far from Dunedin's Rattray Street wharf and close to the coach depot for Central Otago. Choie Sew Hoy named his company Sew Hoy and signed documents as Sew Hoy, so most non-Chinese knew him as Mr Sew Hoy. Meanwhile, his fellow Chinese in Otago knew that his family name was Choie. The black and gold sign which hung outside his store said 'Sew Hoy' in Roman letters but 'Choie Sew Hoy' in Chinese characters. Choie Sew Hoy became a naturalised New Zealand citizen in 1873.New Zealand Tablet, 27 Sep 1873, p.6 He had a good command of English, speaking at meetings and sometimes interpreting at court hearings.Otago Daily Times, 1 Aug 1885, p.10. He was quoted by the New Zealand press on topical issues, such as immigration and the poll tax.Auckland Star, 17 July 1888, p.6. The Sew Hoy company imported and sold the specialised Chinese food and goods required by the Chinese, many of whom, like Choie Sew Hoy, were from the Panyu district. Choie Sew Hoy also imported items to sell to Dunedin's European settlers. His store's newspaper advertisements offered tea sets and tea pots, as well as a range of teas. Also on sale were crystallised fruit, Chinese silks,Otago Daily Times, 20 Feb 1884, p.3 cane chairs, blinds, bird cages and 'real Chinese gongs.'Otago Daily Times, 21 Feb 1885, p.3 In 1873 Choie Sew Hoy and several other Chinese merchants of Dunedin were the first Chinese to charter a ship to sail direct from Otago to Hong Kong. The barque Harriet Armitage carried cargo and 116 Chinese passengers from Otago to Hong Kong in March 1873.Otago Daily Times, 24 March 1873, p.2.Tuapeka Times, 27 March 1873, p.7. Sew Hoy's contribution to her cargo included scrap metal and 78 bales of fungus. Forty-five of the Chinese passengers, it was reported, \\"took with them 2,740 oz [ounces] gold, of the value of ¬£10,000, which, we believe, represents the result of little more than three years' hard work.\\"Bruce Herald, 1 April 1873, p.7 The Harriet Armitage made her return voyage to Dunedin in October 1873Otago Daily Times, 18 October 1873, p.2. The Customs list for Harriet Armitage included 1,498 packages imported by Sew Hoy, 2,842 packages by Kum Goon Lee and 478 packages by Sum Sang Lee. with what New Zealand newspapers described as \\"a cargo of China notions\\"Star [Christchurch], 18 October 1873, p.3 which was \\"consigned to the principal Chinese firms\\" in Otago.Otago Daily Times, 18 October 1873, p.2. Among the four Chinese passengers the Harriet Armitage carried to Dunedin was Choie Kum Yok, Choie Sew Hoy's oldest son, aged 18. In 1876 Choie Sew Hoy and another Otago Chinese merchant, Kwong Sing Wing, chartered the North German barque Anna Dorothea to make a return voyage from Otago to Hong Kong.Otago Daily Times, 19 Jan 1876, p.4. Freshly fitted out to carry passengers the Anna Dorothea sailed from Port Chalmers with 104 Chinese passengers, who took with them 1646 ounces of gold.Otago Daily Times, 28 Feb 1876, p.2 The majority of Chinese miners in Otago were from the Panyu district and Choie Sew Hoy was often their spokesman. In 1876 he protested to the Minister of Customs about the high duties on such Chinese foodstuff as green ginger, where the duty amounted to 200%.Otago Daily Times, 9 Dec 1876, p.3 He also persuaded the Otago Chamber of Commerce to call for an end to the import levy on rice.Otago Daily Times, 12 May 1887, p.3. Choie Sew Hoy's imports, mainly from Hong Kong, were considerable. Dr James Ng, Choie Sew Hoy's biographer, believes that Choie Sew Hoy was the Dunedin Chinese merchant who wrote in 1871 that in a period of some six months, his firm had paid about ¬£2,000 on duties to H.M. Customs.James Ng, Windows on a Chinese Past, Vol 1, p.150 In 1874 Choie Sew Hoy was one of six Chinese merchants of Dunedin who arrived in an open carriage at Dunedin's exclusive Fernhill Club to present an address of welcome to the Governor, Sir James Fergusson, 6th Baronet on his first visit to Dunedin.Otago Witness, 3 Jan 1874, p.4. The other Chinese merchants were William Ah Chew, Kum Goon Lee, Sun War On, Lo Keong, Chin Shing and Mee Wah. In export matters, Choie Sew Hoy was a very enterprising merchant, sending oats to Australia,Otago Daily Times, 21 May 1883, p.2. 143 sacks of oats by the Wakatipu for Sydney frozen mutton to Great BritainClutha Leader, 26 Oct 1883, p.6, Otago Daily Times 4 Jan 1884, p.1, Otago Daily Times, 25 Aug 1884, p.2. and scrap metal to China.Otago Daily Times, 20 November 1871, Page 2 Just like his friend and fellow merchant, Chew Chong of New Plymouth, Choie Sew Hoy purchased dried fungus (Auriculeria polytricha or \\"wood ear,\\" known to the Chinese as muk u or muk yeeNg James, Windows on a Chinese Past, Volume 3, 1999, pp. 313.). He paid 3¬Ωd per pound for dried fungus and advertised widely in the Otago, Nelson and Wanganui regions.Nelson Evening Mail, 29 Jan 1880, p.1; Wanganui Chronicle, 2 Apr 1880, p.3. Choie Sew Hoy exported the fungus to Hong Kong, as well as to Chinese in Australia and California. An Otago reporter describing Choie Sew Hoy's fungus trade was condescending, \\"This peculiar, dry-looking article the Chinese manufacture by some mysterious process into an article of food, no doubt palatable enough to them, but which would, I anticipate, be quickly rejected by fastidious European stomachs.\\"Tuapeka Times, 27 Mar 1873, p.7. Many farmers, however, found that gathering and selling the fungus, which grows on dead trees in the New Zealand bush, enabled them to weather a financially difficult period. Fungus remained an important New Zealand export to China until World War 2. The profits from his role as a merchant enabled Choie Sew Hoy to travel back to his home village of Sha Kong, where he arranged the construction of a memorial marker for his father's grave and a sturdy brick family home, both of which are still standing. Then he did something no other New Zealand Chinese merchant had done ‚Äì he made major investments in New Zealand gold-mining. Gold mining By the late 1870s the easily accessible gold deposits in Otago and Southland had been worked out and individuals could no longer win gold with the simple placer mining methods of using gold pans, cradles and sluice boxes. Large-scale methods such as hydraulic sluicing and quartz processing required large sums of capital for the construction of water races and purchase of crushing machinery. Many companies were floated to work promising claims and Choie Sew frequently invested in such mining ventures. He was for example on the board of directors of several companies which carried out quartz reef mining at Macetown in the 1880s. These included the Premier Gold- Mining Company, the Queen Victoria Gold-Mining Company and the Tipperary Mining Company. Dr James Ng's research shows that Choie Sew Hoy was involved as a shareholder or director in at least a dozen gold mining and water-race ventures, from Waitahuna to Skippers.Ng, James (1993). Windows on a Chinese Past, Volume 1. Dunedin, New Zealand: Otago Heritage Books. pp. 315‚Äì316. . Choie Sew Hoy also made mining claims in his own right, sometimes making dual applications for mining consents with his son Choie Kum Yok. They combined in 1889, for example, to apply for two adjoining claims on the Cardrona RiverOtago Daily Times, 31 August 1889, p.13; Lake Wakatip Times, 18 October 1889, p.3. and in a failed attempt to obtain a pair of claims at Netherby near Naseby in 1886.Mount Ida Chronicle, 15 April 1886, p.3. Choie Sew Hoy and the Otago gold-dredging boom In 1888 Choie Sew Hoy changed the face of gold mining in New Zealand. In his own account of his innovative Big Beach venture, Choie Sew Hoy told how both European and Chinese miners, who had worked the lower Shotover River near Arthurs Point, were aware that the large river flat known as Big Beach was still rich in fine alluvial gold, despite being worked over several times and abandoned.Otago Witness, 12 September 1889, p.11. The problem was that the gold was below the water level in deep shingle, inaccessible to conventional mining methods. Choie Sew Hoy obtained mining rights for 140 acres at Big Beach and nearby Arthurs Point for 'C. Sew Hoy and Company'. He originally proposed \\"to put a tunnel in through the rocky point at the Gorge\\" and divert the Shotover River at an estimated cost of ¬£4000 to ¬£5000. The river flat would then be worked by \\"paddocking and sluicing.\\" Choie Sew Hoy estimated he would be investing ¬£20,000 in working the claim.Lake Wakatip Mail, 15 July 1887, p.2. \\"The claim will be worked by a combination of European and Chinese labour, a new departure in mining,\\" noted an Otago newspaper.Otago Daily Times, 15 September 1887, p.3. Choie Sew Hoy's Dunedin engineer, L.O. Beal, did a survey of the site with him in September 1887 and they concluded that a tunnel beneath Racecourse Terrace at Arthurs Point would not be practicable.Lake Wakatip Mail, 9 September 1887, p.2. Choie Sew Hoy's mind then turned to using a gold dredge. Several attempts at dredging for gold had been made both in California and New Zealand but with limited success. James Gore, a former Mayor of Dunedin later described how Choie Sew Hoy \\"called together a few gentlemen\\" and proposed to them a scheme for working by dredges the well-known Shotover Big Beach. Despite the doubts about dredging that some expressed, a privately owned company, the Shotover Big Beach Gold Mining Company, was formed, \\"the shareholders putting their money into what I considered an experiment.\\"Otago Daily Times, 9 September 1889, p. 3. Letter to the Editor, by James Gore. Choie Sew Hoy apparently drew inspiration from watching the two dredges operated by the Otago Harbour Board, the bucket dredge Vulcan, which began dredging in 1877, and the bucket dredge 222, which was built in Scotland and began work in 1882. 222 had a hopper system so the spoil from its buckets could be collected.Davis, R.M. 'Short History of Harbour Dredging',pdf,hh pp 5-7; (2009), Information Services, Port Otago Ltd; Otago Regional Council website pdf,hh pp. 5‚Äì7 http://www.orc.govt.nz/accessed 15 May 2016. The Shotover Big Beach Gold Mining Company commissioned the engineering firm Kincaid and McQueen of Dunedin to build them a steam-powered centre-bucket-chain gold dredge. This dredge was then transported in sections to Central Otago and assembled on the Big Beach river flat. \\"As is often the case with new mechanical appliances, many additions and alterations had to be made both to the dredge and gold-saving appliances,\\" complained James Gore, \\"These took up considerable time and cost a large sum of money.\\"Otago Daily Times, 9 September 1889, p.3. Trials were carried out and on 23 January 1889, Mr Beal sent Choie Sew Hoy a telegram that was to trigger the first Otago gold dredging boom. 'Dredge working Saturday evening. Engines, boiler, &c.; very satisfactory. Result in tail box beyond most sanguine expectations‚Äî a few ounces. Future prospects magnificent.'Otago Witness, 25 January 1889, p.13. After that, each week's yield was telegraphed to Dunedin and widely reported throughout the colony in the Mining pages of newspapers. \\"Mining is very dull, yet we had a sensation the other week when Mr Sew Hoy's dredge fished up ¬£40 worth of gold in one day,\\"reported the Southland Times.Southland Times, 11 April 1889, p.3. \\"There is great excitement in Arrowtown over the prospect of successfully dredging the Kawarau and Shotover Rivers, owing to the continued payable results of Sew Hoy's dredge at Big Beach, Shotover,\\" noted a Naseby newspaper.Mount Ida Chronicle, 15 August 1889, p. .2 The dredge, immediately labelled the Sew Hoy dredge, was the first in the world capable of working flats and riverbanks. Its success in the dredging of the Big Beach river flats initiated a major gold-seeking breakthrough.Otago Witness, 15 August 1889, p.11 By the end of the century there were over 200 gold dredges working or being built in Otago and Southland, all based on the prototype Sew Hoy dredge of 1888.Ng, James, Windows on a Chinese Past, vol 1, p.335. Sew Hoy Big Beach Gold Mining Coy The Sew Hoy dredge had proved its value on Big Beach but its ladder of buckets could only reach 14 feet below the water level.Otago Witness, 5 September 1889, p.11. More dredges able to reach greater depths were needed. This would need more capital than the Shotover Big Beach Gold Mining Company could raise privately. Choie Sew Hoy had extended his mining claim, so that he now had another 40 acres, stretching about one and a half miles from the company's existing Big Beach claim down the Shotover River to Tuckers Beach.Lake Wakatip Mail, 9 August 1889, p.1. In a meeting held in Dunedin in September 1889, the shareholders of the Shotover Big Beach Gold Mining Company agreed to sell all the company's assets, including the various Shotover mining claims held by Choie Sew Hoy and John Blair, to a new publicly floated mining company. It was unanimously agreed \\"that Mr Sew Hoy's name should in some way be associated with the title of the company.\\"Otago Witness, 5 September 1889, p.11. Thus the new company was launched as the Sew Hoy Big Beach Gold Mining Company Ltd. Choie Sew Hoy joined John Blair (a wealthy Dunedin seed merchant) and Peter Duncan (a successful Otago agricultural implement manufacturer) as fellow directors, while James Gore, a former Dunedin Mayor and Member of the House of Representatives (MHR), became chairman.Otago Witness, 5 September 1889, p.19; Evening Post, 10 September 1889, p.3. In a strong publicity campaign, the new company proposed to put larger and better dredges \\"designed to lift double the amount of stuff\\" on to its \\"wonderfully valuable\\" claim which now covered 260 acres, along five miles of the Shotover River. 80,000 shares were offered at ¬£2 each. With samples of Big Beach gold exhibited in Otago and Dunedin, shares sold well. There was, however, criticism of the heavy \\"loading\\" of the company, as 48,000 of these shares went to the promoters, the owners of the mining claims.Editorial, Otago Daily Times, 5 September 1889, p.2; Otago Witness, 12 September 1889, p.11. The proprietors responded by reducing the nominal capital to ¬£120,000 in 60,000 shares of ¬£2 each, and the Sew Hoy Big Beach Gold Mining Company was successfully floated. \\"56,000 shares were allotted when the list finally closed.\\"Lake Wakatip Mail, 15 July 1892, p.5. . In defence of the proposal, Choie Sew Hoy wrote, \\"The gold won by the present company is the result almost altogether from ground supposed to be worked out, both by Europeans and Chinese. I only wish to add that these results will be far surpassed, and the value of the company, as at present printed, far greater in twelve months than to-day, when we hope to gather the gold with five dredges instead of one.\\"Letter to the Editor, 6 Sep 1889, Otago Witness, 12 September 1889, p.11. In fact, the Sew Hoy Big Beach Gold Mining Coy soon cut its dredge plans to three new dredges. Tenders were called in Oct 1889Otago Daily Times, 1 November 1889, p.3. and John Anderson's foundry in Lyttelton was successful, agreeing to build the three for ¬£14,000.Otago Daily Times, 24 November 1892, p.3. Andersons were well advanced with the first dredge by January 1890.Press, 27 January 1890, p.4. and two others followed. By August 1890 the first dredge had been assembled on the site of the former Morning Star claim and was having its engine fitted, when floods disrupted progress.Lake Wakatip Mail, 8 August 1890, p.2. So the first new dredge (no.2) was not getting gold until 22 Dec 1890.Otago Witness, 1 January 1891, p.12. Despite delays in construction and flood damage caused by the 'raging river,‚Äô, all four dredges were at work by May 1891.Evening Star, 12 May 1891, p.3 The three new dredges ‚Äì prosaically named Dredges 2, 3 and 4 ‚Äì were of identical construction. Each was 94 feet long, 18 feet wide and 7 feet deep, with bucket ladders 70 feet in length. Lake Wakatip Mail, 15 July 1892, Page 5 Tuapeka Times, 8 September 1897, Page 2 Each dredge had a coal-fired steam engine, rated at 26 horse power, with a boiler working at up to 80 lb per square inch. Each of the 25 steel buckets could hold between 2¬Ω and 3 cubic feet of material. All three dredges could work down to about 26 feet.Otago Daily Times, 18 August 1899, Page 2 Because the alluvial gold proved to be very fine, the company also had to fit their dredges with quicksilver [mercury] tables and were constantly upgrading their gold-saving systems.Lake Wakatip Mail, 20 February 1891, p.3Lake Wakatip Mail, 15 July 1892, p.5 Although returns were steady, costs were also high and by 1897 the directors of the Sew Hoy Big Beach Gold Mining Coy went into voluntary liquidation and sold off the dredges and other equipment.Otago Witness, 2 September 1897, Page 18Otago Daily Times, 4 September 1897, Page 5 Ironically the dredges were purchased by other companies and worked on fruitfully for years. Choie Sew Hoy meanwhile was looking further south for gold. Nokomai gold sluicing Before Big Beach was worked out, Sew Hoy and his son Kum Poy had turned their attention to the Nokomai valley (near Parawa) in Southland, where they both registered neighbouring claims in January 1894.Mataura Ensign, 12 January 1894, Page 5 While earlier miners, both European and Chinese, had found gold in the valleys and spurs surrounding the Nokomai Valley, they had been unable to work the valley itself, because its gravel layer was too deep and wet to work. Finding the area also unsuitable for dredging ‚Äì the gravel layer was over 100 feet deep ‚Äì the Sew Hoys decided to use large-scale hydraulic sluicing. Water was crucial for this, so they had water-races, pipe-ways and dams constructed, drawing water from as far north as the Nevis headwaters. In 1898, Choie Sew Hoy calculated that he had spent ¬£15,000 and employed 40 men to bring the water to the Nokomai site.Otago Daily Times, 14 Feb 1898, page 2Tuapeka Times, 9 Oct 1897, page 4 \\"Mr Sew Hoy is one of the most enterprising men in this part of the colony, and it is gratifying to hear that his pluck and energy have met with success,\\" noted a local newspaper when Choie Sew Hoy introduced electric lighting at the Nokomai site so that work could continue in three shifts around the clock.Tuapeka Times, 26 February 1896, Page 3 Both Europeans and Chinese (many from Sha Kong village) worked at the sluicing and on maintaining the water-races. The Nokomai Hydraulic Sluicing Company was a publicly floated company registered at the Sew Hoy office, warehouse and store at 29 Stafford Street, Dunedin. After Choie Sew Hoy's death in 1901, Kum Poy Sew Hoy headed the Sew Hoy merchant business and also put a massive effort into the development and working of the Nokomai claim. He took a leading role with the company, working as its secretary.Otago Witness, 11 May 1904, Page 22 Both Europeans and Chinese (many from Sha Kong village) worked at the sluicing and maintaining the water-races. Later Kum Poy's son Cyril Sew Hoy (1907-1971) became the manager at the Nokomai workings, thus creating a unique three-generation gold mining dynasty. Between 1894 and 1932, the Nokomai gold miners won gold worth ¬£223,043 from the Sew Hoy Nokomai claimThe Press [Christchurch] 20 March 1933, page 12 but the running costs involved were becoming too high. In 1932 The Nokomai Gold Mining Coy Ltd was floated, with capital of over ¬£60,000, to try a revolutionary method of gold production. A giant dragline excavator, weighing 150 tons, was assembled at Nokomai. The largest ever made at that time, the excavator had a 50-foot-high winch tower and a bucket that could hold 8 tons of shingle.New Zealand Herald, 18 March 1933, page 8 The dragline failed because its bucket system proved too heavy, so the company resumed hydraulic sluicing successfully assisted by the rising price of gold in the 1930s. The Nokomai operation finally had to close down during World War 2, when the New Zealand Government requisitioned the company's electricity generating plant and installed it at the Roaring Meg power station in the Cromwell Gorge. Kum Poy died, aged 74, in Dunedin on 22 December 1942. Choie Sew Hoy‚Äôs family Choie Sew Hoy had married Young Soy May in China in the 1850s and they had two daughters Choie Chay Ho and Choie Chay May, as well as two sons, Choie Kum Yok (1855-1932) and Choie Kum Poy (1869-1942). Both sons later came out to New Zealand to join their father in his merchant enterprise. Choie Kum Yok arrived in Otago in October 1873 on the barque Harriet Armitage, (a ship chartered by Dunedin Chinese merchants including his father). Kum Yok, then aged 18, began working in his father's firm as a merchant. Later he took out gold mining claims in Central Otago, usually in parallel with those taken out by his father. Following a brief visit to Sha Kong in 1880, Kum Yok returned permanently to China about 1897 and handled the Canton end of Sew Hoy's company business from Guangzhou (Canton city ), until his death in 1932. The younger son, Choie Kum Poy, arrived in Dunedin on the Tamsui in July 1884, aged 15. Kum Poy studied at Dunedin's Normal School before he began working with his father. Following Choie Sew Hoy's lead, he used Sew Hoy as his surname, so is usually known as Kum Poy Sew Hoy. Meanwhile, Choie Sew Hoy had married his young English-language secretary, Eliza Ann Prescott (1868-1909) and they had two children, Violet (born in 1892) and Henry (born in 1895). The Sew Hoy family lived in \\"Canton Villa,\\" a modest weatherboard house in Cumberland Street, where their general servant enjoyed \\"liberal wages.\\"Situations Vacant Column, Otago Daily Times, 15 Jun 1901, p.1 On 22 July 1901, Sew Hoy turned at the gate to wave to Eliza, before walking to his office, suffered an aneurysm and died. The news of his death was published in all Australian and New Zealand newspapers.Evening Star [Dunedin], 22 July 1901, p.5; The Age [Melbourne] 23 July 1901, p.6; Otago Daily Times, 23 July 1901, p.4; West Coast Times, 26 July 1901, p.4; Evening Star [Boulder, West Australia], 15 Aug 1901, p.4. Cheong Shing Tong and Cantonese reburials Soon after their arrival in Otago, the Cantonese gold-miners from Poon Yu (Panyu) and Fah Yue (Hua) counties had founded a benevolent society, the Cheong Shing Tong, to care for elderly and needy Chinese, and also to return their bodies to Canton. Choie Sew Hoy was the first president of the Cheong Shing Tong. When the society began its first mass exhumation of deceased miners' remains in 1883, all the fundraising and administration was run from Choie Sew Hoy's office at his store in Stafford Street, Dunedin. In April 1883 230 bodies, mainly from Otago and the West Coast, were safely conveyed to China for reburial by the SS Hoihow. Ironically by the time the Cheong Shing Tong had organised the next major exhumation, between 1899 and 1902, Choie Sew Hoy had died (in 1901). It was left to his son Kum Poy Sew Hoy (his successor as the president of the Cheong Shing Tong) to continue overseeing the gathering of human remains from 39 graveyards around New Zealand.Otago Daily Times, Monday 20 October 1902, p.3. The bones of the 'former friends' were carefully cleaned, labelled and packed into zinc-lined kauri coffins or body- boxes. A total of 501 coffins were loaded on the SS Ventnor in Wellington. (The total had been thought to be 499 but Nigel Murphy's recent research in the NZ Archives found the names of at least 501 and possibly 503.) The SS Ventnor sailed from Wellington for Hong Kong on 26 October 1902 but struck a reef off the coast of Taranaki early the next morning. The captain tried to make for Auckland but the Ventnor sank about ten miles off the Hokianga Heads on 28 October 1902.Otago Daily Times, 30 October 1902, p.7. Although three lifeboats got away safely, the fourth was swamped, drowning 13 men, including Choie Sew Hoy's elderly nephew, Choie Kum Foo, who was one of the body- attendants accompanying the coffins. Searchers found only a few of the coffins washed ashore, and there the matter rested until a remarkable series of events more than a century later. Recent events In 2009, Liu Shueng Wong, a New Zealand-born Chinese researcher and writer, was working with Nigel Murphy and Kirsten Wong on what they named The Ventnor project, preparing a filmed documentary about the sinking of the SS Ventnor and the significance of its cargo of human remains. Liu Shueng spoke with MƒÅori people along the Hokianga coast. She was told that the local Te Rarawa, Ngapuhi and Te Roroa iwi (tribes) had stories they had grown up with about human remains washing up on the beaches and being buried in urupa (burial-places). \\"I always heard that there were Chinese people buried in different urupa and in the sand dunes and places like that,\\" says Te Rarawa's Paul White. \\"People got told by the old ones don't forget to look after the Chinese people that are buried over there.\\"'Northland discovery closes chapter in New Zealand‚Äôs gold mining history', Newshub website; 7 July 2009; http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/northland-discovery-closes-chapter-in-new- zealands-gold-mining-history-2009070719#axzz4CezsYlhl; accessed 26 June 2016. In March 2009, the MƒÅori groups involved invited representatives of the Chinese New Zealand people to meet with them at Matihetihe Marae in Mitimiti. Members of the Ventnor Project, the Poon Fah Association (people of Panyu and Hua counties descent), Otago-Southland Branch of the New Zealand Chinese Association and several descendants of Choie Sew Hoy came. They were able to acknowledge their tupuna (ancestors) whose remains had been washed up on Mitimiti beach, and \\"to open relations with the iwi who have cared for the remains of their ancestors since 1902.\\"'SS Ventnor Shipwreck', by Robyn Kamira, 5 August 2010, Kamira Whanau website http://www.kamirawhanau.com/?p=1069; accessed 26 June 2016.

In 2014 MƒÅori Television screened a documentary film, 'The Lost Voyage of 499', narrated by George Henare, which shows Duncan Sew Hoy, a great- grandson of Choie Sew Hoy, with his son Dr Peter Sew Hoy, retracing their ancestor's life and death.'The Lost Voyage of 499'; Maori Television website: http://www.maoritelevision.com/tv/shows/pakipumeka-aotearoa-new-zealand- documentaries/S01E001/lost-voyage-499. By coincidence, 2014 was also the year, a diving group, the Project Ventnor Group, led by John Albert, began to examine the 150-metre-deep wreckage of the Ventnor, using deep diving and decompression equipment. (Remote equipment had spotted the wreck in 2012.) Working in difficult conditions, the divers confirmed the shipwreck was indeed the Ventnor.'ss Ventnor ‚Äì New Zealand‚Äôs deepest dived shipwreck', by Keith Gordon & Dave Moran; 8 April 2015, Dive magazine website: http://divenewzealand.co.nz/ss-ventnor-new-zealands-deepest-dived-shipwreck/; accessed 26 June 2016. .

In the interim, a legal loophole was also closed. All shipwrecks in New Zealand waters prior to 1900 are classified and protected as heritage sites. The Ventnor, which, sank in 1902, was outside the law but was now given the same legal protection. On 8 May 2014 the wreck was added to the New Zealand Archaeological Association's site recording scheme and is now covered by the archaeological provisions of the Historic Places Act 1993. It is now illegal to damage or modify the wreck or remove items from it. .'Ramblings: The sinking of the Ventnor', by Peter de Graaf; September 2014; http://www.pdg.net.nz/ventnor.htm; accessed 26 June 2016.

The 185 submissions ‚Äì 166 of which came from Sew Hoy family members ‚Äì overwhelmingly urged that the Ventnor artifacts should be preserved in a museum, preferably The Museum of New Zealand: Te Papa Tongarewa. On 10 June 2016, Paul James, the Chief Executive of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage stated that the Crown will assume custody of the Ventnor objects to allow for their future care and management. Te Papa seemed the most likely destination. Meanwhile, planning is going ahead for a Chinese Historic Ventnor Trail in Northland.

She experimented with monotype, with different ways of biting the plate, and with electric tools to incise lines upon zinc and copper plates.More on Golahny's printing can be found at . Street Car Scene, by Golahny, oil on canvas, 1940s Artists with whom Golahny found affinity include Max Beckmann, Paul C√©zanne, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, and Nicolas de Sta√´l. Golahny‚Äôs earliest work uses a darker palette and rougher line than her later work. This early work, such as Street Car Scene, reflects city life in Detroit, New York City, and Chicago: people on buses or trains, workers in factories, and children at play. One series of works, begun around 1964 with a multi-block color woodcut, was titled Landscape of Man in the Nuclear Age.MacGibeny, Abigael. ‚ÄúStates of Being: Berta R.

Golahny reprised this composition of a whirligig (a central pole with carts swinging from it) in a 1987 woodcut and in several subsequent large paintings. Inspired by publications on nebulae and black holes, Golahny began the Space series in 1980. In dozens of paintings she modeled her images on photographs of cosmic exploration in the archives of the Harvard College Observatory. She also painted evocative layerings of an imagined passage through space and time, and fantastic semi-formed creatures.Golahny, Berta. \\"How I Came To Paint The Crab Nebula: The Development Of Cosmic Themes In My Oil Paintings.\\" Leonardo: International Quarterly of the Arts and Sciences 23.4 (1990): 363-365.

It is part of the Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) and provides education for a four-county service area, mostly in the metro Atlanta area. The school's service area includes Dekalb, Rockdale, Newton, and Morgan counties. GPTC is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award associate degrees, diplomas, and technical certificates of credit. Many of the school's individual technical programs are also accredited by their respective accreditation organizations.Accreditations section of official GPTC website History GPTC was first established in 1961 as DeKalb Area Vocational School. The college was initially organized in cooperation with the Vocational Division of the State Department of Education and operated by the DeKalb County Board of Education. DeKalb Technical College operated as a division and campus of Georgia Perimeter College (known then as Dekalb College) from 1972 to 1986, and as the post secondary unit of DeKalb County School System until June 30, 1996. On July 1, 1996, DeKalb Tech began operating as a unit of the Technical College System of Georgia. In 2000, DeKalb Technical Institute's name was officially changed to DeKalb Technical College.Our Heritage and History section of official GPTC website. Last accessed 2012-01-14. The college enrolled its first class of 18 students in Electronics Technology in 1961. At that time, the college was in temporary quarters while the DeKalb Campus facility was under construction. The facility on North Indian Creek Drive in Clarkston opened in October 1963 and consists of five buildings, totaling 275,000 square feet of floor space. In 2018, the U.S. Department of Education placed the college on heightened cash monitoring status, a status that places additional financial demands on the college as related to federal financial aid. Shortly thereafter, the college's system began investigating finances at the college. As a result, the college's president was fired and four other administrators placed on leave.

It is known for being able to consume and maintain algae endosymbiotically for days before digesting the algae. It has the ability to eat red and green algae, and afterwards using the chlorophyll granules from the algae to generate energy, turning itself from being a heterotroph into an autotroph. The species was discovered in January 2012 outside the coast of Niv√•, Denmark by professor √òjvind Moestrup. In contrast to certain other species of the genus, Mesodinium chamaeleon can be maintained in culture for short periods only. It captures and ingests flagellates including cryptomonads. The prey is ingested very rapidly into a food vacuole without the cryptomonad flagella being shed and the trichocysts being discharged. The individual food vacuoles subsequently serve as photosynthetic units, each containing the cryptomonad chloroplast, a nucleus, and some mitochondria. The ingested cells are eventually digested. This type of symbiosis differs from other plastid-bearing Mesodinium spp. in retaining ingested cryptomonad cells almost intact. The food strategy of the new species appears to be intermediate between heterotrophic species, such as Mesodinium pulex and Mesodinium pupula, and species with red cryptomonad endosymbionts, such as Mesodinium rubrum.

Plot  The film opens as school pariah, Dina Van Cleve (Jenn Proske) walks down the hallway of her school. When she opens her locker, a pile of condoms that were put inside as a prank comes falling out. Later, Dina is shown alone in her bedroom recording a video diary. When her mother, Rachel (Liz Vassey) returns home, she finds Dina has hanged herself. The film then flashes back six weeks, showing Dina as a popular and talented field hockey player who was voted Homecoming Queen at her school. However, the night ends on a bad note when she changes her mind about giving her virginity to her boyfriend, Mark (Ryan Kelley), who leaves angry. Dina returns home while Mark goes to an after party and cheats on Dina with her rival, Skylar Reid (Kelli Goss). Dina takes a few pictures of herself naked and sends them to Mark the next morning. But when she arrives at school, she is surprised by applause from the student body and soon realizes that her pictures has been seen around campus. Distraught by a wall of cruel comments written about her in the girls' bathroom already, Dina demands that Mark tell her who he sent them too, but he swears he didn't do it. Back in the present, Rachel is in Dina's room when someone calls Dina's phone. It turns out to be one of her friends, who was studying abroad. She tells Rachel that the only way she'll find anything about Dina is to look online. Rachel discovers Dina's video diary and tries to question Claire Stevens (Rachel Delante), who won't tell her anything. After going to the school administration to question the social networking profiles that were cyber bullying Dina, Rachel writes an article damning the school administration when they refuse to help her and seem more interested in covering up the entire incident. The article catches the attention of many news networks and causes the administration to endure severe backlash, but it also damages Rachel's cause. No one at Dina's school will talk to her and she loses some of her real estate work because no one will buy a house from her. Rachel becomes the target of a revenge campaign. Someone stuffs her mailbox full of letters that say \\"Leave It Alone\\" with cut-out letters and a picture of a noose. Dina's grave is vandalized with someone spray painting \\"Dina is a slut\\" and leaving her torn letter and condoms. After breaking down and begging Mark to tell her what happened, which he doesn't do, Rachel heads home. Upon her return, someone throws a brick through the front window, breaking the glass. Mark is arrested for distributing child pornography. One of the school administrators visits Rachel's home and tells her the news, but Rachel remains unapologetic due to the school keeping Dina's bullying hidden instead of stopping it. Driving, Rachel spots Claire and asks her what she knows. Claire reveals that she saw Skylar and Mark hooking up at the after party and witnessed Dina begging Mark to help her stop the circulation of the pictures. However, Skylar walked up and insulted her, causing Dina to leave. Skylar then revealed she sent the pictures from Mark's phone to one other person to prove Dina wasn't the saint she acted like. Mark comes by to visit Rachel and as the two talk, Mark once again says that he wasn't the one who sent the pictures around. Due to what she heard from Claire, Rachel believes him and learns from him Dina started skipping field hockey after the bullying got worse. Rachel thanks Mark for his help and goes to visit her long-time friend and Skylar's mom, Patricia (Judith Hoag). In a flashback, Claire asks Skylar to lay off Dina. However, Skylar says that someone should report Dina to the coach so she will get kicked off the team. She later manipulates Claire into doing it since she can't because she lost the position of team captain to Dina and it would look like \\"sour grapes\\". Skyler also talks about why Dina sent a nude photo ending one of the sentences with \\"no birthmarks\\" while Claire still listens to the former of which's point of view. At the Reid house, Rachel tells Patricia that she knows Skylar was the one who sent the pictures out. Despite their daughters' rivalry, Patricia refuses to believe Skylar would do something so terrible. Patricia then asks her daughter in front of Rachel if she sent the pictures and Skylar says no. Rachel asks to see Skylar's phone, but Patricia refuses. ‚àí After Rachel breaks down, Patricia offers to make her some tea while she fixes herself up in the bathroom. While inside, Rachel knocks over a pile of magazines and sees the original cut-out words from the letters in her mailbox. After Rachel leaves without revealing what she has found, Skylar tells her mom that she did send the pictures out, but to only one person. Rachel decides to drop the charges against Mark, but wants to change the direction of the investigation to focus on Skylar. However, the police reveal that Claire was the one Skylar sent the pictures too and she proceeded to send it to forty other people. Rachel goes home and hears one of Dina's video diaries playing. In Dina's room, she finds Claire, who runs away. Rachel watches the video where Dina reveals that she got kicked off the field hockey team because of the pictures and lost her scholarship (which Skylar then gained) because her coach was forced to report it to her college of choice. It turns out this video diary was the last one Dina made before she committed suicide. In the flashback, Dina is clearing out her locker when Skylar begins gloating. The two get into a nasty fight until Skylar reveals that Claire was the one who told the coach. Feeling completely betrayed, Dina viciously turns on Claire just as she walks in. Clearly upset by the entire situation, Claire says that she just didn't want the whole team to be disqualified if Dina's pictures were discovered. Pleading her innocence, Claire insists that she didn't send the pictures, but intended to destroy them. However, she forgot her phone in the limo on Homecoming and it ended up back at Skylar's house. Slowly, Rachel realizes that Patricia sent the pictures from Claire's phone just as a furious Skylar confronts her mother after discovering the copies on Patricia's phone. She also realizes that it was her mother who trashed Dina's gravesite and threw the brick through Rachel's window. Patricia pleads with Skylar to understand that she did everything for her because she never would've gotten the field hockey scholarship to Price otherwise. Disgusted by her mother's actions as well as her lack of remorse and refusal to take any responsibility for driving Dina to suicide, Skylar takes the family car and runs away, but crashes into a tree shortly after while angrily texting Patricia \\"I will never forgive you\\" after her mother sent her a message begging forgiveness. Patricia is later arrested for the distribution of child pornography. Rachel visits Skylar in the hospital, where it is revealed that she may be paralyzed from the waist down permanently. Patricia asks if Rachel came to gloat, but Rachel apologizes that Patricia is going through what she went through, that she found Dina as a threat to Skylar's success and that their friendship was never real. She promises to pray for Skylar's recovery, but vows to see Patricia in court and ensure that she is punished for what she did to Dina. Rachel then leaves as Patricia breaks down in tears. Rachel is shown recording a video diary of her own, wondering if her quest to understand what Dina went through has made any difference. Claire visits her house and asks Rachel to come with her to the school because she has a surprise. Rachel enters the packed auditorium where Claire gives a passionate speech about bullying and the deadly consequences of it. She goes on to say that Dina was bullied to death and that her suicide was the fault of everyone who not only participated in the bullying itself, but those who allowed it to continue instead of stopping it (including herself). Starting with her and Mark, the other students then give up their cell phones for the rest of the semester and vow to prevent further bullying at the school. The movie ends with Rachel watching one of Dina's earlier video diaries with Claire.

Life Shortland was born at Courtlands near Lympstone in Devon, England, the third son of Thomas George Shortland and brother of Willoughby Shortland, and of Peter Frederick Shortland. He was educated at Exeter grammar school and at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1835 and M.A. in 1839. He then studied medicine, and was admitted an extra-licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1839. In 1841 Shortland went out, apparently at his brother's suggestion, to New Zealand, where on 28 June 1841 he was appointed private secretary to Governor William Hobson. On 3 August 1842 he was appointed protector of aborigines. On 10 August 1843 he landed at Akaroa on Banks' Peninsula, to act as interpreter to Colonel Godfrey's court of inquiry into the land claims of the French company, the Nanto-Bordelaise Co. of Jean Langlois,teara.govt.nz, Akaroa, French Settlement at. which was then trying to settle there. After the court closed he took a census of the peninsula. Shortland reported on various land claims on 18 March 1844. About 1851 he returned for a time to England, and stayed mainly at Plymouth. In 1860 Shortland served in the Expedition of the Thousand of Garibaldi. He was again in England that year, and became M.R.C.P. He then practised medicine for many years in New Zealand, and subsequently lived for some time at Parnell. In October 1889 Shortland finally returned to England. He died at Plymouth on 5 July 1893. Works Shortland name is mostly identified with the relations between the English and the Maori in the earlier days of settlement. His major works are: * The Southern Districts of New Zealand, London, 1851. * Traditions and Superstitions of the New Zealanders, London 1854. * Maori Religion and Mythology, London, 1882.

The South Australian boundaries are shared with the West Australian border, the Northern Territory border, the Queensland borders, the New South Wales border and the Victorian border‚Äîthat is, all states and territories except for the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania. History Map showing the creation of the colonies/states and mainland territories. 1788‚Äì1832 In 1788, Governor Phillip claimed the continent of Australia only as far west as the 135th meridian east longitude (135¬∞ east) in accordance with his commission. (26 January 1788 - Map) The line of 129¬∞ east first became a border in Australia as the western border of New South Wales (NSW) in 1825 (16 July 1825 - Map). On 16 July 1825, the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated at 129¬∞ east to take in the new settlement at Melville Island. From 1825 to 1829 129¬∞ east was the NSW border. Following the settlement of the Swan River Colony (SRC) in 1829 (2 May 1829 - Map), the eastern boundary was declared to be 129¬∞ east, that is coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time. The colony of Western Australia (WA) was commissioned in March 1831. From 1829 to 1832 129¬∞ east was the SRC/NSW border. 1832‚Äì1836 The name of the Swan River Colony changed to Western Australia in 1832 (6 February 1832 - Map).Territorial evolution of Australia - 6 February 1832 From 1832 to 1846 129¬∞ east was the WA/NSW border. 1836‚Äì1846 South Australia became a colony in 1836 and until 1846 would be surrounded on land by New South Wales (NSW), with South Australia extending west to the 132¬∞ east longitude.

An inflated self-control belief may lead to greater exposure to temptation, and increased impulsiveness. Therefore, the restraint bias has bearing on addiction. For example, someone might experiment with drugs, simply because they believe they can resist any potential addiction. An individual's inability to control, or their temptation can come from several different visceral impulses. Visceral impulses can include hunger, sexual arousal, and fatigue. These impulses provide information about the current state and behavior needed to keep the body satisfied. Empathy Gap Effect: The Empathy Gap Effect deals with individuals having trouble appreciating the power that the impulse states have on their behavior. There is a cold-to-hot empathy gap that states when people are in a cold state, like not experiencing hunger, they tended to underestimate those influences in a hot state. The underestimation of the visceral impulses can be contributed to restricted memory for the visceral experience which means the individual can recall the impulsive state but cannot recreate the sensation of the impulsive state. Impulse Control and Attention: Studies have concluded that when people believe that they have stronger sense of self-control over situations in their environment, they have greater impulse control. Individuals also tend to overestimate their capacity for self-control when one is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint. The more someone is told that they have a high capacity for self-restraint, the more they believe it and display higher levels of impulse control. Attention has a lot to do with biases, self and impulse controls in our environment. The less attention an individual pays to something, the less control they have over whatever they are doing. Focusing attention to oneself can lead to successful self-control which can be helpful in many aspects of life. Self-control engages conflict between competing pressures, pressures that can be brought on by situational or internal prompts from the environment. Some of the cues make the individual act on or engage in that behavior or act to prevent the individual from taking action.

The pirate skiff hit Pati√±o with automatic fire before being repelled, damaged by return fire and captured after a brief chase by the vessel's helicopter. The encounter took place off the coast of Somalia and ended with the death of one pirate and the capture of six others. Action Pati√±o had been deployed on the Indian Ocean for her second tour as part of Operation Atalanta since November 2011, when she departed from her home port of Ferrol. Pati√±o was the flagship of the EU naval forces in Somali waters. At 03:30, on 12 January 2012, while at anchor after escorting a World Food Programme ship with humanitarian aid to Mogadishu, Somalia, a sentry aboard the Spanish vessel gave the alert when he spotted a skiff alongside Pati√±os hull, with the obvious intention of boarding the ship. The skiff was manned by seven individuals, who opened fire on the Spanish unit with AK-47 rifles. The pirates apparently mistook the warship for a freighter.Pirates attack Spanish navy ship off Somalia, prompting gunbattle and helicopter chase Associated Press, 12 January 2012 Pati√±o was hit on her hull and funnel by 50 rounds in the ensuing gunbattle, which lasted up to two minutes. The Spanish vessel returned fire with her light armament, but when the pirates continued the aggression, the Spanish sailors proceeded to \\"neutralize\\" the threat with what the Spanish Ministry of Defence described as \\"self-defense fire\\", which forced the skiff to flee. The motor boat was then chased by one of Pati√±os SH-3 Sea King helicopters for , warned by megaphone and eventually stopped after a last burst across her bows from the helicopter's machine gun. During the pursuit the attackers threw overboard three ladders, two bags and seven rifles. The Spanish personnel captured six men of whom five were wounded, three of them seriously. The pirates declared that a seventh member of the crew was killed in the exchange of fire and that his dead body fell to the sea. The skiff, damaged by gunfire, was confiscated by the Spanish authority. Aftermath Eloy Velasco, the judge in charge of the Audiencia Nacional of Spain ordered the arrested men taken to Spain for questioning under charges of piracy, possession of illegal weapons, damage to government property, and assault on members of the security forces. Velasco considered that the attack in international waters came under Spanish jurisdiction since the assault was carried out against Spanish citizens and no current agreement with a third country prevented a Spanish trial. An alternative trial location had been Kenya, following a May 2009 arrangement with the European Union granting Kenyan jurisdiction over acts of piracy committed in the Indian Ocean. However, in 2010 Kenya's High Court had ruled that the Kenyan government should put on trial only those subjects captured inside its territorial waters. This was overturned by the Kenyan Court of Appeal in October 2012, by which time the Spanish trial for Pati√±os pirates had already commenced. During their trial in Spain, all six men pleaded not guilty, claiming they were fishermen who had approached Pati√±o for assistance at sea. In October 2013 the men were convicted of attempted piracy by a Spanish Court and sentenced to eight years in jail. One man, Hamoud Elfaf Mahou, received an additional four and a half year term after also being convicted of belonging to an identified criminal organization. In April 2014 the prosecution successfully appealed the length of sentences, arguing that the piracy constituted an actual rather than attempted attack on the ship. An additional five years was added to each sentence, extending them to between thirteen and seventeen and a half years.

Antipater was born and raised in Telmessos in Lycia at an unknown date during the reign of Lysimachus of Telmessos. Lysimachus of Telmessos, ruled as the second Ptolemaic Client King of Telmessos from February 240 BC until his death in 206 BC. Lysimachus‚Äô son, Ptolemy II of Telmessos, ruled from 206 BC until at least 181 BC. Ptolemy II was the fourth and final ruler from their family to rule Telmessos and was also, the third and final Ptolemaic Client King of Telmessos. His first name Antipater, recalls the great marshal Antipater of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism, p.103 Antipater was a distant relation of the great marshal Antipater, through Berenice I.

By this time Ptolemy II, Antipater with their families having excellent relations with Antiochus III reveals they had broken away from Ptolemaic influence,Bagnall, The administration of the Ptolemaic possessions outside Egypt, p.107 however there is a possibility their family connections with the Ptolemaic dynasty wasn't not wholly broken.

The film centers on three people trapped in an ATM booth by a psychopathic hooded figure.  Plot  David Hargrove (Brian Geraghty) is a stockbroker having trouble asking out his co-worker Emily Brandt (Alice Eve). At a Christmas party, he offers to drive her home. Reluctantly, he also agrees to drive home his other co-worker Corey Thompson (Josh Peck). During the ride, Corey has David stop at a local ATM booth, needing to withdraw cash to buy pizza. The two join Corey inside the booth when he encounters card problems. The three spot a hooded figure in a parka coat lurking outside in the parking lot. David and Emily suspect the figure to be a robber and discover he cannot enter the booth without an ATM card. When the hooded man kills a dog walker like it's nothing, they attempt to phone the police, but Corey lost his phone at the party, David's phone battery is dead, and Emily's phone is in her purse in the car. The hooded man shuts down the booth's heater. David opts to negotiate their safety by giving the killer $500, earrings, and a watch. He uses this to escape to his car, where he finds out that the vehicle's ignition wires have been severed, and the car cannot start. He attempts to call 911 but is attacked by the man. He accidentally drops Emily's phone as he escapes. Emily uses her lipstick to write \\"HELP\\" on the booth's window to attract attention. The three of them are freezing when a security guard locates them. When the guard tries to call the cops, the hooded man beats him to death using a tire iron from David's car trunk, leaving the three shocked. When a man with a similar coat enters the booth, he is killed by David and Corey, but is revealed to be only an innocent janitor. Frustrated, Corey leaves but gets caught and stabbed by the hooded man. After several hours, David and Emily realize Corey is still alive. They retrieve him from outside, narrowly managing to return to the booth before the hooded man can get to them. The man blocks the booth door with David's car and tries to freeze them to death by filling the booth with cold water. Corey dies of blood loss and hypothermia. David lifts Emily on his shoulders to trigger the fire sprinkler system alarm but he slips, causing Emily to fall and fatally break her neck. The hooded man slams David's car into the booth. Angered, David improvises a Molotov cocktail and throws it at the killer but the figure he sets ablaze turns out to be the dead guard. The police arrive but arrest David as the hooded man hides himself in the crowd. As David is driven away, he sees many figures wearing parkas in the crowd. The police recover surveillance recordings of the events in the ATM booth, but it is made clear that the killer had planned his actions so as not to appear in the footage, meticulously framing David for his crimes. In the final scene, the hooded man returns to his headquarters, where he begins to map out similar attacks on other ATMs.  Cast  *Brian Geraghty as David Hargrove, a stockbroker who seems to have trouble with work, especially when a phone call with his customer \\"Mr. Dean\\" ended *Alice Eve as Emily Brandt, David's love- interest and co-worker *Josh Peck as Corey Thompson, David's lazy best friend and other co-worker * Mike O'Brian as The Man * Robert Huculak as Robert * Ernesto Griffith as Security Guard * Bryan Clark as Jerry * Daniel De Jaeger as Luke * Omar Khan as Christian * Aaron Hughes as Patrolman * Will Woytowich as Sargent * Glen Thompson as Harold  Production  Filming began September 2010 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

He authored several books and notably two volumes of The World's Parliament of Religions: An Illustrated and Popular Story of the World's First Parliament of Religions, Held in Chicago in Connection with the Columbian Exposition of 1893. The Department on the Study of Islam at the University of Chicago Divinity School is named after him.  Biography   Early life and education  Barrows was born in Medina Township, Michigan on July 11, 1847, to John Manning and Catherine Moore Barrows. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Olivet College in 1867. He received his theological training from Yale Divinity School and Union Theological Seminary during 1867‚Äì1868 and 1868‚Äì1869 respectively.The New York Times‚Äì Oberlin's President dead ‚Äì John Henry Barrows succumbs to Pneumonia He became the member of Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims and was a student of pulpit oratory of Henry Ward Beecher, while at Union Theological Seminary. For two and a half years, he did missionary and educational work in Kansas and preached for a year in the First Congregational Church ‚Äì Springfield. He did preaching domestically and abroad for a while and graduated later from Andover Theological Seminary in 1875. He was then ordained to the Congregational ministry in 1875.  Marriage and family  Barrows married Sarah Eleanor; together they had three daughters and a son. He held pastorates from 1875 to 1881 at the Eliot Congregational Church in Lawrence, Massachusetts and Maverick Congregational Church of East Boston.  First Presbyterian Church pastor  In 1881, he became the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, which he held for fourteen years. During his stint as sixth pastor of Presbyterian Church, he became one of the most famous preachers of his time. He conducted Sunday evening service and spoke at temperance and missionary meetings. He was also a favourite speaker before gatherings at Chautauqua, New York and served on the advisory council of the Chautauquan System.The New York Times REASONABLENESS OF PRAYER.; Dr. John Henry Barrows Preaches Before the Chautauqua Assembly. He went to India and the Orient ‚Äì Japan and Honolulu ‚Äì to give the Haskel Lecture through the Haskell Foundation (endowed by Caroline E. Haskell) in 1896 for the University of Chicago, which he continued lecturing for next two years. Dr. Barrows served as minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Chicago between 1886 and 1891.  Oberlin College president  Barrows was elected as the president of Oberlin College in 1899, and under him the institution was said to be prospered greatly. He died in office on June 3, 1902. Congress of Religions The World's Parliament of Religions was held in Chicago, Illinois, on the shore of Lake Michigan in 1893. Representatives of Protestantism, Hinduism, Jainism, Islam, Judaism, Catholicism, Greek and Russian Orthodoxy, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, Ethical Culture, and others, met with objectives as mentioned in the 1891 Preliminary Address, including: * To bring together representatives of religions from all around the world. * To bring forth the truths the various religions teach in common. * To promote the brotherhood among the religious men of diverse faith. Charles Carroll Bonney, the president of the World's Congress Auxiliary and a layman in the Swedenborgian church, initiated the process for organizing the Parliament of Religions by appointing John Henry Barrows as chairman to administer the General Committee on World's Parliament of Religions. Under his leadership in June 1891, invitation copies in the thousands were sent to religious leaders around the world, reporting the plan for the Parliament of Religions scheduled to be held in 1893. However, the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, the home church of Dr. Barrows, the then Sultan of Turkey, the European Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and many prominent evangelical leaders of North America such as Dwight L. Moody bitterly opposed the convention. Though there was no unanimous approval for the convention from Presbyterians, intense disapproval was worded in the letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury saying that \\"... the Christian religion is the one religion. I do not understand how that religion can be regarded as a member of a Parliament of Religions without assuming the equality of the other intended members and the parity of their position and claims.\\" Though Max M√ºller, an Orientalist and Philologist, failed to attend the convention, yet he hoped the Parliament of Religions would increase the interest in the study of religions. Despite varied encouragement and opposition, Parliament of Religions began on 11 September 1893. More than 4000 people gathered in the \\"Hall of Columbus,\\" dominated predominantly by English- speaking Christian speakers along with limited representatives from other religious faiths ‚Äì 12 speakers represented Buddhism; 11 speakers represented Judaism; 8 from Hinduism; 2 each from Islam, Parsi, Confucianism, and Shintoism; and 1 each from Taoism and Jainism. The convention continued for seventeen days with a variety of topics presented by a variety of speakers from various faiths and traditions. Most of the 17-day sessions were chaired and presided over by Dr.Barrows himself; Most of the times, he also performed the customary act of \\"silent prayer\\" and said the \\"Universal Prayer.\\" Observations Religion formed the essence of the convention in pushing aside the importance of culture and ethnicity. In the words of John P. Burris, \\"religion was perceived as the center of any given society and the most obvious aspect of culture through which the essence of a given people's cultural orientation might be understood.\\" Hence, the decision to select the suitable religions to be part of the \\"Ten Great World Religions\\" through inclusion or exclusion pushed aside culture and ethnic contexts. Due to this, the Parliament included only converted African Americans by excluding Native Americans altogether. The official objectives of the Parliament seem to have avoided an attitude of supremacy of one religion over another in the '1891 Preliminary Address'; nonetheless, much emphasis was laid in bringing forth the commonalities among the worldwide religions and thereby building \\"human brotherhood.\\" In no case were there either attempts or aims for devising a \\"Universal Religion\\" or unity. It seems that the Parliament was able to introduce the importance of the comparative study of religions in order to maintain \\"mutual good understanding\\" among the various religious traditions as hoped by Max M√ºller. According to Donald H. Bishop, there were three common attitudes towards other religions in the Parliament, namely, 'inclusivism', 'exclusivism', and 'pluralism'. To highlight these, Donald H. Bishop took illustrations from the speeches and views expressed by speakers in the convention; these are captured in both volumes of The World's Parliament of Religions: An Illustrated and Popular Story of the World's First Parliament of Religions, Held in Chicago in Connection with the Columbian Exposition of 1893, authored by Dr. Barrows. * exclusivism: Bishop observes that exclusivist attitudes were either offensive or amicable in type. For this, he took the presentation made by William C. Wilkinson as an example: * inclusivism: Donald H. Bishop defines inclusivism as an attitude towards other religions based on an underlying assumption that one's religion is superior to others, but this assumption is expressed through openness towards other religions. He means to say that the beliefs of other religions could be possibly included or subordinated to the terms defined by inclusivists with no effect on their own religious superiority. Once other religious beliefs become subordinated, they are longer 'threatening' to the superior religion and its beliefs. * pluralism: Bishop observes that pluralism was expressed in the Parliament's emphasizing more the peaceful coexistence of religions by rejecting any claim to supremacy of one over other religion. He referred to Charles Carroll Bonney's opening speech to express the pluralistic attitude of the Parliament: As reported in the article \\"World Parliament of Religions\\" (1893), the attitude towards plurality was evident in the invitations sent to all religious representatives worldwide: In words of Dr. Barrows, \\" 'human progress' would objectively reach its culmination through Christianity. As the apex of all religions, Christianity can influence other religions meaningfully, but not vice versa.\\" Apparently, Dr. Barrows' aim for the World's Parliament of Religions's convention was to appreciate and welcome other religions and their beliefs with open heart, but subordinate them to the finality of Christianity. However, this seems, to have been threatened by the \\"Universal Religion and Universal religious truth,\\" said to have been proposed by Swami Vivekananda. As reported in the article, John H. Barrows continued with a Christian version of the Darwinian ‚Äì survival of the fittest, which he also mentioned in his writings: The efforts of Dr. Barrows and World's Parliament of Religions has visibly left significant legacies for America and its people. In the words of Joseph Kitagawa, \\"A strong stimulus for the wide acceptance of the study of comparative religion\\" in America emerged in academic life. While Rev Dr Marcus Braybrooke, President of the World Congress of Faiths, said that \\"other religions and faiths introducted to Americans other than Christianity has raised the awareness about 'religious plurality' among Americans.\\"Rev Dr Marcus Braybrooke, Writer of over 40 BooksDiana L. Eck also sees the first World's Parliament of Religions as one of the first events of the ecumenical movement. It seems to have influenced Christian missionaries abroad and also religious figures from East ‚Äì Swami Vivekanada, Anagarika Dharmapala, Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, and Soyen Shaku -, towards an appreciation of other religious traditions. Some excerpts A letter preserves a speech of Anagarika Dharmapala, who was a Buddhist delegate from Ceylon ‚Äì then a British colony. He was invited to represent \\"Southern Buddhism.\\" A few excerpts from that speech: Dr. Barrows had advertised in the Chinese newspapers proposing a premium in gold for the best essays on Confucianism and Taoism. This drew 42 Chinese scholars to enter the competition. The selected Chinese essay was translated into English and read on the fifth day, Friday, September 15, 1893. A Chinese by the name of 'Kung Hsien Ho' of Shanghai won the first prize. Dr. Barrows, in the absence of representation of the Hindu creed, ensured a unique audience there after he had won the confidence of India's representatives as their host at Chicago. Being desirous to write on Hinduism, he wrote a letter to more than 100 prominent Hindu's requesting each to explicate some of the leading tenets of Hinduism according to their views. He received just one reply: A letter was sent by 'S. Horiuchi', a Japanese and Secretary of the Society for the Restoration of Buddhist Holy Places in India: Silent debate with Swami Vivekananda Dr. Barrows invited Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda to make some remarks during the Parliament of Religion sessions; Vivekananda responded with a short fable to illustrate the variety of men of different races and religions, just before the close of the afternoon session on the fifth day, Friday, 15 September 1893. As reported in Rediff.com, the Chicago Tribune listed Swami Vivekananda as being introduced in the afternoon session after a lunch recess; A news report titled \\"Common Cause\\" on the same day appeared in the Chicago Tribune and described the attire of Swami Vivekananda as a \\"single violent orange garment\\".Rediff.com Swami Vivekananda emphasized tolerance and rejected bigotry The article written by 'Wesley Wildman' titled \\"World Parliament of Religions (1893)\\" states that Vivekananda's three speeches drew the most attention from the American public. It also states that Dr. Barrows recorded in his works that when Vivekananda addressed the audience as \\"Sisters and Brothers of America,\\" he drew wide applause which lasted for several minutes.At last he came to the rostrum, and Dr. Barrows introduced him. Bowing to Sarasvati, the Goddess of Wisdom, he addressed the audience as 'Sisters and Brothers of America. Another article mentions about Dr. Barrows' comments on Vivekananda's influence in Parliament: \\"World Parliament of Religions\\" (1893), written by Wesley Wildman, states that Dr. Barrows mentioned in his works Vivekananda's belief that \\"every religion is only an evolving of God out of the material man; and the same God is the inspirer of all of them.\\" The article also states: The article also mentions the interpretation of \\"Universal Religion\\" as: Dr. Barrows, in his \\"Review and Summary\\" of the Parliament, seemed to attack Vivekananda's idea of \\"Universal Religion,\\" having perceived it as a 'threat' to Christian supremacy. It seems, Dr. Barrows expressed his concerns: Eventually, Dr. Barrows supported the Christian version of Darwinian ‚Äì \\"survival of the fittest,\\" saying, as mentioned above: There is also a quotation in an article about Dr. Barrows, in his History of the Parliament of Religions: There are some interesting and contradicting facts about Swami Vivekananda's belief in Spirituality and Vegetarianism. As reported in an article written by 'Shashi Shekar' for Rediff.com, the author found some article clippings that appeared in The New York Times wherein Vivekananda debunked spirituality and vegetarianism, apparently during an event in New York City in May 1894, while speaking on vegetarianism to an audience.Rediff.com Swami Vivekananda debunked spirituality and vegetarianism There is another article from The Outlook; then, Vivekananda preferred \\"beef\\" as his food with Dr. Barrows. The article seems to have appeared on July 17, 1897: There is also a contradictory report about Vivekananda's master Ramakrishna aka Ramakrishna Paramahansa, a mystic, for having learned or known Sanskrit as a language. There is a second-hand story in The Outlook magazine, re-published in several articles. According to the reports, Dr. Barrows had learned an interesting story from Max Muller, professor at Oxford University about Sanskrit, where Max Muller had asked Swami Vivekananda if his master, Ramakrishna, knew Sanskrit. Abraham Lincoln had become a Christian claim Dr. Barrows claimed that Abraham Lincoln had become a Christian without providing any evidence. In the Lincoln Memorial Album, following Lincoln's assassination, Dr. Barrows wrote a few comments about Lincoln's religion:  Bibliography  * Seven Lectures on the Credibility of the Gospel Histories ‚Äì 1891 * The World's Parliament of Religions: An Illustrated and Popular Story of the World's First Parliament of Religions, Held in Chicago in Connection with the Columbian Exposition of 1893.

It posted a modest opening weekend at the local box office, which grossed $608,731 for Roadshow on 235 screens, giving it a screen average of $2,590. By the end of the first week, the film had grossed only A$917,000. By the end of its cinema run in Australia, the film had grossed only A$1.53 million, leaving the film a box- office failure when compared to the previous two feature films produced by Working Dog, namely The Castle (1997) which earnt over $10 million and The Dish (2000) which grossed almost $18 million. Overall, the film ranked 102 on the list of most successful films at the Australian box office in 2012. Reception The film received lukewarm reviews. Leigh Paatsch, writing in the Melbourne Herald-Sun, felt that the film's strongest point was the banter between the characters, which was funny and engaging, but Paatsch said that Lawson's central performance was marred at times by \\"an air of self-satisfied smarm\\" and the character's path to enlightenment was unfocused and unconvincing. He concluded, \\"And I sense that others who similarly fell hard for the soulful sincerity of The Castle and The Dish will feel a little quizzical about the comparative slickness of Any Questions for Ben? \\". Tom Ryan in the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the film was often very funny and singled out Rachael Taylor's performance for praise - \\"the camera loves her\\". As a romance, though, Ryan felt that film failed to convince. \\"The problem for the film-makers is maintaining dramatic interest whilst he [central character Ben] sorts out his quarter-life crisis. Their solutions, alas, aren't especially satisfying. And the endless montages of Melbourne [...] make our city look beautiful [...] but contribute nothing.\\" Sandra Hall, in the Melbourne Age, said that the film was bright and shiny and made Melbourne appear \\"dressed up in candy colours\\", but the film's attempts to generate humour were laboured and desperate, with an over-reliance on musical montages. \\"The whole thing made me nostalgic for Working Dog's sharper days\\". Luke Buckmaster, writing on Crikey, was scathing in his review, saying the film had \\"blobs of writer's block offal masquerading as a storyline\\" along with an implausible relationship at its centre with no emotional connection between the two leads. \\"Working Dog have made precisely that - a dog\\". However, Jim Schembri, also writing in the Age, praised the film as \\"very enjoyable, character-rich, and thoughtful\\".

Barney enters the base with vacation supplies, but discovers his true purpose when bumping into the heavy artillery and is refused departure.

Constructed in the middle of the nineteenth century, it held a significant place in the culture of the local black population, and it has been named a historic site. Situated at Ohio's southernmost point, the Burlington vicinity saw large numbers of runaway slaves and free Negroes in the decades before the Civil War.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 856. Into such a context, a group of Baptists settled and founded a church at some point between 1811 and 1813; after a period of worshipping in their homes, the congregation constructed a small and primitive church building.Marker #4-44 Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church , Ohio Historical Society, 2003. Accessed 2014-12-08. Late 1849 was the church's watershed moment: Virginia landowner James Twyman freed many of his slaves at his death and provided for them to be given land near Burlington, and thirty- two of them settled near the church on land that they officially owned, beginning at the end of October. Joining with the existing Baptist congregation, they helped build a replacement church building on Macedonia Ridge, from which the congregation took its name of \\"Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church\\". With such a large group of black immigrants, the church began to occupy a prominent place for local blacks, both religious and cultural, and as the years passed, numerous groups of members were sent out to found daughter churches; eight such churches, both in Ohio and in present-day West Virginia, remained active into the late twentieth century. Macedonia Baptist Church is a simple building, constructed without an architectural style. Its plain gable-front plan features three side windows but no openings in the front gable per se; one enters through double doors at the base of a short bell tower, which is itself set into the front gable. Simple weatherboarding covers the walls, which rest on a stone foundation and are topped with a tin roof; the main body of the building has a plain roof with a steep pitch, although the tower's roughly square shape necessitates a pyramidal roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-23. In 1978, Macedonia Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its important place in local history. It is one of four Register-listed locations in and around Burlington, along with the old county jail, the local black cemetery, and the William C. Johnston House and General Store, and one of nineteen countywide. The Ohio Historical Society placed a state historical marker at the church in 2003.

Situated on San Agust√≠n Street, the bullfighting museum is dedicated to the matador Francisco Montes Reina (1805‚Äì1851), nicknamed \\"Paquiro\\", who was born in this town. He is considered the most important 19th century bullfighter, because of his skill at the sport, on foot or on horseback. The bullfighting displays include pieces of great historical and artistic value. It was inaugurated in 2003 and founded by Pedro Leal Aragon who for seven years collected objects, souvenirs and bullfighting implements. One of its first events was a group show of the artists Antonio Vela, Carlos Quevedo, and Paloma Garcia. After a renovation, it re-opened in June 2005 with miniature models of the bullring in Ronda, a head bust of Paquiro, and an original painting by Antonio Cavanna.The expansion also housed Spain's most important bullfighting collection, Collection Sagnier, which was acquired by the city to improve the historical and artistic quality of the municipal bullfighting museum. There are four rooms: bullfighting origins, Paquiro and his time, contemporary bullfighting, and the bull and the arts. The museum's garden is used for book presentations, press conferences, weddings and small concerts. It is closed on Sundays.

Born in Glasgow, Scotland, she married Francis Sinclair, a ship's captain. With six children in tow, the family moved to New Zealand. Her husband and eldest son (and much of the family's property) were later lost at sea. After years of farming, mainly at Pigeon Bay on the Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury region of the South Island, she decided to relocate to Canada. Unhappy with the conditions she found on Vancouver Island, she considered California but instead went to Hawaii where she bought the Hawaiian island of Niihau for $10,000. She later bought additional lands at Hanapepe and Makaweli on the island of Kauai.Novitz 2010 Her descendants, the Robinson family, continue to own and maintain the island of Ni'ihau.Dunford 2003  Early life  Elizabeth Sinclair was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on 26 April 1800. Known as \\"Eliza\\", she was one of six children born to William (or James) a successful merchant, and Jean Robertson McHutcheson (sometimes spelled \\"McHutchison\\").Peterson 1984, 335-340 Eliza married Captain Francis W. Sinclair (1797‚Äì1846) of the Royal Navy on 13 January 1824. They had three sons and three daughters. Sinclair was considered a master navigator, best known for saving the life of the Duke of Wellington in rough seas while escorting him on his return from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.Daws, 1962Stepien, 1988, 35.Harrington, Hawaiian Encyclopedia New Zealand The Sinclairs moved to New Zealand, arriving in 1841; they settled in Pigeon bay in 1843. Eliza's husband and her oldest son George disappeared at sea in 1846 during a business trip headed towards Wellington. Her husband was carrying all the family's cash and produce supplies.Joesting 1984, 190 After the disappearance of her husband, Eliza and her five children were left to survive on their own in Pigeon Bay. With her children marrying and producing grandchildren, the Sinclair clan needed more land, and Eliza's son Francis helped plan a new voyage towards that end. They sold their property in New Zealand and sailed to the Pacific Northwest of the United States with the goal of acquiring property in British Columbia. Pacific Northwest In early June 1863, the Bessie arrived in Victoria, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. The Sinclairs found the land wild and undeveloped with thick forests, making the effort required to clear land for agriculture close to impossible with their limited labor and resources. Eliza set her sights on California, but an acquaintance named Henry Rhodes recommended that they avoid the rough oceans during the winter as it would make anchorage difficult. Rhodes suggested that they sail to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) instead, since his brother lived in Honolulu. The Sinclairs agreed, and they boarded the Bessie one last time.Tabrah 1987, 97-98 Hawaii At the age of 63 years, Eliza led 13 members of her family to Hawaii, arriving in Honolulu Harbor on 17 September 1863 on the vessel BessieJoesting 1984, 189 captained by her son-in-law, Thomas Gay. The 300-ton barque arrived fully provisioned, with Merino sheep, one cow, hay, grain, chickens, a grand piano, books, and clothing. Eliza was considered a \\"chiefess\\" by the native Hawaiians she and her family employed on the island of Niihau and in Makaweli on Kauai.Joesting 1984, 144 In 1885, her niece Isabella McHutcheson Sinclair, who married Eliza's son Francis, authored and illustrated Indigenous Flowers of the Hawaiian Islands which has become an important record of the Hawaiian flora. The illustrations are of plants from Kauai and Niihau islands.  Descendants  Her descendants continue to run the island under their private ownership.  Notes   References  *Bird, Isabella L. 1875.

Adjacent to the former monastery is the basilica church of Santa Giustina, initially built in the 6th century, but whose present form derives from a 17th-century reconstruction. History A church dedicated to the St Justina of Padua and of other 4th century Christian martyrs of Padua, was present at the site by the 520s, erected under the patronage of the Prefect Opilius and housing the relics of the saint. The church was already described as lavish in decoration in the 565 biography of Life of St Martin, written by Venantius Fortunatus. By the 10th century, pilgrims who came to the basilica to venerate the saints' relics, were ministered by monks. In 971, Bishop of Padua placed the community under the Rule of St. Benedict. Renovations were soon begun on the basilica. On 2 August 1052, workers putatively exhumed remains of various saints, including Maximus the Confessor, Felicitas of Padua, Julian the Hospitaller, and even some identified as the Holy Innocents. In 1110 the abbey was sacked by the troops of the future Holy Roman Emperor Henry V during his invasion of Lombardy, in order to punish the monks for their loyalty to Pope Pascal II. In 1117, the complex was devastated by the powerful Verona earthquake. After the basilica and monastery were rebuilt, excavations resumed and in 1174 the remains of the patroness of the abbey was discovered, and in 1177, some remains attributed to St Luke the Evangelist. A period of decline in the observance of its way of life began to develop in the monastic community. At the same time, the monks were led by a number of very spiritual abbots, such as Arnaldo of Limena, who died while imprisoned by Ezzelino III da Romano and is honored as \\"Blessed\\", as is Nicholas of Prussia. The abbey, however, reached the height of its influence under the leadership of Ludovico Barbo, who, despite being a canon regular and not a monk, was appointed as abbot by the bishop in order to undertake a reform of the monastic life in the abbey. He was successful and the abbey became the nucleus of the Congregation of Santa Giustina, which spread to include monasteries throughout Europe who came under the guidance of the Abbot of Santa Giustina. The congregation later became called the Cassinese Congregation. The abbey developed ties with centers of learning across the continent. The religious community was suppressed in 1797 when, after the occupation of the region by Napoleon's French Revolutionary Army. Its artworks and the most valuable collections of the abbatial library were sent to Paris by the occupying forces. The monks were expelled and the buildings and property were sold off in 1810. The cloisters were then used as a military hospital, later as a barracks. The buildings were returned to the Catholic Church in 1917 and Pope Benedict XV re-established the abbey with all its ancient rights and privileges. He placed it under the Abbey of Praglia in nearby Teolo, which sent monks to resume monastic life there. On 1 November 1942 the community was declared an autonomous priory, which was established under its own abbot on 22 January 1943. The basilica and abbey now have the government status of a national monument and operate under the authority of the Superintendent of Monuments and Civil Heritage.

Later he moved to Canterbury, eventually getting a job in Christchurch for the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, who he previously worked for in Melbourne. Skellerup became self employed in 1910 with the manufacture of rubber products; his company was called the Para Rubber Company. By 1918, he had four retail outlets. After floating his company on the stock exchange in 1919, he had the capital to open further shops in both the North and South Island. Being hard hit by the Great Depression, he set up further companies in the late 1930s: the Latex Rubber Company (waterproof coats), the Empire Rubber Mills (milking machine components), and the Marathon Rubber Footwear (gumboots). He was denied a licence by the government for manufacturing car tyres. Caused by the shortages of World War II, he was asked by the government to reclaim rubber from old car tyres. There was not enough salt in the country for this venture and in 1942, he started the project to obtain salt from Lake Grassmere. He set up Skellerup Solar Salt Ltd, which later became Dominion Salt when the government took over the company. At his death in 1955, he was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Valdemar Skellerup (1907‚Äì1982) who was chairman and joint managing director of Skellerup Industries for 26 years, and was knighted in 1980.

After being discharged from the military for homosexuality in 1976, she successfully challenged her discharge in court and returned to military service in 1987‚Äîthe first openly gay person to be reinstated after being discharged under the military's policy excluding homosexuals from military service. She served until 1990 when the Army succeeded in terminating her service after prolonged judicial proceedings. Early life Ben-Shalom was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, one of six children in a Roman Catholic family, and grew up in the surrounding area of Big Bend and East Troy. After her mother died in an automobile accident when she was six, she was largely raised by her father, a World War II veteran and owner of a local chain of convenience stores. Graduating from high school in 1967, she married for a short time and had a daughter. The next year, she converted to Judaism and, at the age of 19, left with her daughter for a five- year residence in Israel, where she took up Israeli citizenship, remarried, changed her name to her current name and served in the Israeli Army during the War of Attrition as the driver of an armored personnel carrier. In 1971, she returned to the United States, divorced and entered the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, majoring in creative writing and graduating with a B.A. and M.A. Service, discharges and activism In 1974, Ben-Shalom enlisted in the United States army reserve and joined the 84th Training Division. In 1975, she read the cover story of Time magazine's interview with Leonard Matlovich, a Vietnam War Air Force veteran who decided to come out of the closet as a homosexual and was fighting his discharge. Although Ben-Shalom was out to her commander, the commander made no move to dismiss her until, after graduating from drill sergeant's school, she appeared on local television and outed herself as lesbian. Her commander filed discharge proceedings against her, and she was honorably discharged in 1976. Ben-Shalom took the Army to court to overturn her dismissal, and in 1980 Judge Terence Evans of the U.S. District Court in Chicago ruled that her dismissal violated the First, Fifth and Ninth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution based upon testimony that she was only dismissed because of her statement to the press. The Army refused to comply with the ruling, and the case dragged on until 1987 when the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago confirmed the previous ruling and forced the Army to comply with the ruling by threatening contempt of court fines. Ben-Shalom reenlisted in September 1988, but the Army appealed the decision and finally won an August 1989 decision from Judge Harlington Wood, Jr. that ruled against Ben- Shalom by ruling her statement to the press as an admission of guilt in violating military policy. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal of the case on February 26, 1990, and Ben-Shalom's military career ended. Ben- Shalom returned to Waukesha and was one of six LGBT veterans who founded the Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Veterans of America (GLBVA), today known as the American Veterans for Equal Rights. She continued to participate in a number of protests against the military policy excluding homosexuals from service and in 1993 protested the military's new \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) policy by joining David Mixner in chaining herself to the White House fence. After a long period of work as a teacher, she returned to direct action and was arrested on November 15, 2010, in uniform after chaining herself to the White House fence along with other participants, including Dan Choi. Personal life She is a member of the New England Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Veterans and of the California Alexander Hamilton American Legion Post 448. A resident of Milwaukee with her life partner, Karen Weiss also serves as a full-time tenured instructor of English with the Milwaukee Area Technical College. Tributes In 2015, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month. Opposition to transgender activism Miriam Ben-Shalom has become increasingly involved in speaking out against transgender activism that, in her opinion, \\"erase\\" women; and gender identity legislations that, according to Ben-Shalom, pose a threat to \\"Title IX, sex- segregated spaces, and scholarships for females\\". In 2016, she added her signature to the Change.org petition Statement: L is out of GBT.Statement: L is out of GBT (April 2, 2016). Change.org. Retrieved 18 May 2019. @ https://www.change.org/p/hrc-statement-l-is-out-of-gbt. (The URL for Change.org is blocked due to spamming and cannot be linked with a citation template.) Ben-Shalom testified before the Texas Senate Committee on State Affairs on March 7, 2017, in support of Senate Bill 6, which would require transgender people to use the bathroom or changing facility of the sex stated on a person‚Äôs birth certificate rather than of their claimed gender identity. She has also availed herself of the support offered by conservative media outlets and organizations. In 2017, she co-founded Hands Across the Aisle, a nonpartisan coalition of \\"radical feminists, lesbians, Christians and conservatives\\" who oppose \\"gender identity legislation\\". That same year, she appeared in the \\"Biology Isn't Bigotry: Why Sex Matters in the Age of Gender Identity\\" panel sponsored by The Heritage Foundation. In February 2018, she was a speaker at the \\"Gender and Sex Conference\\" in Madrid, sponsored by HazteOir/CitizenGo.. CitizenGo. February 23, 2018 In an essay for The Federalist, she spoke out against bathroom laws that permit transwomen to use \\"opposite-sex\\" restrooms and locker rooms, describing them as \\"a matter of unspeakable oppression against females\\". In a 2019 interview for PJ Media, Ben-Shalom denounced equating the \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" (DADT) military policy against lesbians, gays, and bisexuals that was rescinded in 2011, with the ban on transgender military service that went into effect on April 12, 2019. Milwaukee Pride Parade controversy In 2016, she was invited to be the Grand Marshall of the Milwaukee Pride Parade. Shortly after the invitation was made, the Board of Directors of the non-profit organization behind the parade became aware of comments about transgender women by Ben-Shalom on her Facebook page that were considered to be transphobic. They rescinded the invitation in an email letter to Ben-Shalom that she made public in a Facebook post: See also *Sexual orientation and the United States military References External links * Miriam Ben-Shalom at Veterans History Project, Library of Congress * Miriam Ben-Shalom at glbtq.com * Miriam Ben- Shalom at The Federalist Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriates in Israel Category:Jewish American military personnel Category:American LGBT military personnel Category:American military personnel discharged for homosexuality Category:Converts to Judaism from Roman Catholicism Category:Educators from Wisconsin Category:Israeli expatriates in the United States Category:Israeli soldiers Category:Lesbian feminists Category:Lesbians Category:Radical feminists Category:LGBT Jews Category:LGBT people from Israel Category:LGBT people from Wisconsin Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Women in the United States Army Category:People from Waukesha, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee alumni ","title":"Miriam Ben-Shalom"},{"id":"34384449","text":"Maria Gloriosa The Erfurt bell (1497)Musical Association (1902).

Formed by some of Youngstown's large Welsh American community, it was once the center of Welsh life in Youngstown, and it has been designated a historic site. During the middle and late nineteenth century, Youngstown began to develop as an industrial powerhouse,Williams, Judy. '. National Park Service, 1985-11-18. and its population expanded with the arrival of thousands of western European immigrants. The largest ethnic group was Welsh, many of whom came to work in coal mines at Brier Hill, west of the city. Some of the Welshmen founded a Congregational church at Brier Hill in 1845, but significant growth prompted the members to construct a new building in Youngstown itself, near downtown, in 1861. This building, the present structure, soon became an ethnic community center as well as a house of worship.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 967. Major reconstruction was performed on the building in 1887, completely changing its architectural style. Few other alterations were made over the next century, and by the 1980s, it was Youngstown's oldest church and the only frame house of worship without recent modifications. One and a half stories tall, the church is composed of weatherboarded and shingled walls and an asbestos roof, set upon a stone foundation. It was originally a Greek Revival structure, although the Queen Anne style has dominated since 1887. The floor plan is vaguely cruciform, with the arms placed so near the street that they appear to form the facade, and the top of the cross protrudes only a slight distance from the arms. All sections are gable-roofed. Small dormer windows are placed in the arm roofs, and a polygonal tower with a steep roof sits atop the facade., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2010-02-13. In 1986, the Welsh Congregational Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its place in community history. It was part of a multiple property submission of downtown-area buildings, along with numerous commercial buildings, the Masonic Temple, and First Presbyterian Church. By this time, it was no longer occupied by its original owners, having become home instead to the Messiah Holiness Church.

Career Pro Patria Born in Saronno, the Province of Varese, Lombardy, Sala started his professional career at Pro Patria, located in Busto Arsizio, also in the Province of Varese. Sala had played for Pro Patria since ca.2005, for the Giovanissimi team. Sala made his professional debut during 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione. That season Luca Anania was the starting keeper and Matteo Andreoletti was the second keeper, while Sala was a player of Berretti reserve team. However Sala also played in the round 12, replacing Matteo Serafini after Anania was sent off. Sala also played in the next round. Internazionale In July 2011 F.C. Internazionale Milano borrowed Sala from Pro Patria for its Primavera under-20 team. The team was short of keepers, as in June 2011 Francesco Bardi was graduated from Inter \\"spring\\" while Alberto Gallinetta was transferred to Parma. Initially Sala would compete with Raffaele Di Gennaro for the first choice, who missed most of the 2010‚Äì11 season due to injury. However Sala was also injured. Coach Andrea Stramaccioni used overage player Paolo Tornaghi (7 games) as well as borrowed Riccardo Melgrati (3 games + 2 in Europe) and Matteo Cincilla (3 games, 1 as sub + 1 in Europe) from Inter's Berretti under-18 team. Di Gennaro also played twice in the group stage of NextGen series and once in the cup after he recovered. On 14 January 2012, the first league match after the winter break (week 14), Sala became the first choice while Di Gennaro was on the bench, winning against Cittadella 4‚Äì1. However it was reversed in the next match, the rescheduled week 4 fixture. He was also able to play once more against Brescia (week 16), the match between the NextGen series and Torneo di Viareggio, where Di Gennaro was the first choice in those tournaments. Sala played again in round 20 (10 March), the match after the rescheduled round 18 on 7 March, as well as round 21 (on 17 March), the match before the NextGen semi-finals (and possibly final; Inter did win the tournament). After Di Gennaro joined the first team as fourth keeper, Sala collected his fifth appearances and the first under Daniele Bernazzani, a 0‚Äì1 loss to Chievo on 31 March (week 23), the fifth loss of Inter in the reserve league. However Sala was rested again in week 24 (4 April). That mid-week fixture Di Gennaro played his sixth match and once again out-numbered Sala. However Sala once again played on 7 April against bottom club Vicenza (rescheduled week 22) as Di Gennaro once again joined the first team. Sala was the backup again in round 25 and 26 (last round). In total, Sala played 6 times, Di Gennaro 8 times, Tornaghi 7 times and both 3 games for Melgrati and Cincilla (1 as sub). In the playoffs, Sala was the backup of Di Gennaro. However, in the second match (semi-finals), Di Gennaro was injured during the match. Sala replaced him in 69th minute and played the whole extra time. He conceded 2 goals (in second half and extra time respectively) but Inter striker Samuele Longo also scored twice in extra time and beat Milan 4‚Äì3.Primavera: Inter 4-3 AC Milan, Longo decisive In the final Sala conceded 2 goals but the strikers also scored 3 goals to win the league. Pro Patria return Sala returned to Pro Patria and went to pre-season camp in July 2012. Ternana In 2013, he was signed by Serie B club Ternana in a temporary deal. On 1 July 2014, Sala was signed by Serie C club Reggiana. On 25 July 2014 Sala returned to Serie B for Ternana in a temporary deal, for a reported ‚Ç¨100,000 loan fee, with an obligation to sign. Sala signed a 1+2 year contract. He was the understudy of Alberto Brignoli (2014‚Äì15 season) and Luca Mazzoni (2015‚Äì). Rimini On 20 August 2019 he joined Rimini on a one-year contract with an option for the second year.

Formed in the 1810s as Medina's first church, it worships in a high Gothic Revival church building constructed in the 1880s, which has been named a historic site. Parish history The first preacher in Medina Township was an Episcopal priest, R. Searle, who arrived from Connecticut in 1817; his first recorded sermon in the township was preached at the house of Zenas Hamilton on 11 March of that year. Before long, Searle organized a parish dedicated to St. Paul, and the first church building was constructed on 10 April;History of Medina County and Ohio. Chicago: Baskin and Battey, 1881. because of the scarcity of resources, this building was used for a time as a union church by both the Episcopalians and the Congregationalists. As Medina increased in population, the place of worship was moved there from its original remote location. During their earliest years in Medina, the parishioners worshipped in the courthouse; this condition endured until the construction of a frame church building, which was completed in an uncertain year during the episcopacy of Bishop McIlvaine. In the 1880s, the church decided to construct a replacement structure; it was consecrated in 1887, three years after construction was completed. Architecture The present church building is the 1887 structure, for which the parish solicited prominent architect Gordon W. Lloyd after learning of his previous commissions in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other parts of Ohio. One of Lloyd's last church buildings, it demonstrates the influence of Richard Upjohn.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 984.

Its floor plan is reminiscent of many other Anglican churches, with the typical tower atop the narthex and the rectangular nave. In a similar manner, the building is constructed in the shape of a cross, due to the construction of transepts connected to the chancel. Even the tower is reminiscent of traditional Anglican churches, due to the presence of a belfry with a steep pyramid-shaped roof and louvred openings. The main body of the church features ogive windows and a gabled facade, while small cloverleaf-shaped windows are placed in the tower above the entrance and below the main windows. Preservation In 1982, St. Paul's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of ten Medina locations on the Register, it qualified because of its historically significant architecture, as it is Medina County's best Gothic Revival church building.

It is approximately three miles southeast of Baltimore, Maryland and just south of Martin State Airport.  Facilities  Airfield Diagram The 48 acre airport is surrounded by 588 acres of undisturbed and pristine wetlands and heavy forest. As the last light general aviation airport in Baltimore County, the airpark offers a 2,084 by 28 foot asphalt runway and a 3,000 by 300 foot water runway. Local aviation enthusiast use it to fly single engine airplanes, ultralights, seaplanes, banner towing, and Radio controlled aircraft. Essex Skypark has been an operating public use airport for over 60 years. Early history 1946 USGS topo map incorrectly labels the airport as ‚ÄúDiffendall‚Äù Aviation enthusiast William Diffendahl carved the airpark out of local farmland in the late 1930s and early 1940s and it was used by aviation enthusiasts from the working communities around the Baltimore Glenn L. Martin Company plant that built the Martin M-130 flying boat, the Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and other aircraft in the 1940s. A 1947 Maryland Airport Directory listed the airport as having two intersecting grass runways: a north‚Äìsouth strip 2,200 feet in length and an east‚Äìwest strip 1,800 feet in length. Buildings on the airport (which was owned and operated by Isabelle Diffendahl) included an administration building, a 44-foot by 60-foot hangar as well as eight t-hangars. The early years were very good to the airport with more than 200 pilots calling the field their homeport. These pilots included crop dusters, air traffic reporters, traveling salesmen, daredevils and more. Sometime around 1949 the land was purchased by J. S. Shapiro and renamed Eastern Airport. The airport continued to flourish and prosper throughout the 1950s and 1960s adding a seaplane base on adjacent Back River. By 1964, the longer of the two turf runways was paved and taxiways added. In 1967 the airport was renamed Essex Skypark. Many factors led to a decline in growth and revenues in the following years. By the 1970s however, things had stabilized.\\"Essex Skypark Adds to Area's Aviation Legacy\\" Ron Snyder, Essex-MiddleRiverPatch 25 Sept 2011) Recent history In April 2000, using money from the Maryland Rural Legacy Program, Baltimore County bought the airport and surrounding 588 acres from the Shapiro Family for about $2.6M. The property came with a Maryland Environmental Trust easement that called for protecting the forest and wetlands and provided for the continued operation and use of the existing airport. Many different uses have been suggested for the site's future, such as creating a forest mitigation park to offset development elsewhere in the county, to a Chesapeake Wildlife Sanctuary and environmental research facility for Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland. In 2006, Baltimore County accepted a grant from the Maryland Aviation Administration to repave the runway, taxiways, and apron along with a 15-year commitment to keep the airport. On 10 April 2012, the Essex Skypark Association purchased a 99-year lease for the 44 acre airfield and associated seaplane base on the Back River from Baltimore County. The Association assumed all responsibility for maintaining and operating the airfield under the terms of the lease. A branch of the Civil Air Patrol and a model airplane club also use the facility. The lease allows to Association to host three public events or fly-ins a year, one of which is an annual ‚ÄúWings & Wheels Fly-In‚Äù in September that is open to the public. At present Essex Skypark is home to a number of antique and experimental amateur built aircraft in addition to more modern aircraft. The Chesapeake Model Aircraft Association members fly their model aircraft from a small runway at the airport. The airport is also the host for the Essex Skypark Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (ESSTEM) Aviation Training Program. The ESSTEM is a approved 501.C.3 tax exempt non-profit (DLN 26053406002910) organization. The purpose of the ESSTEM is to provide base level aviation related education and skills training to young adults that desire to pursue a career in the aviation field. Educational programs include flight simulation training, hands on aircraft maintenance skills training, aviation seminars and one-on-one mentoring.

Formed during the middle of the 19th century, it worships in a prominent church building that has been named a historic site. In the early 1840s (perhaps in 1841, but the date is uncertain), a Methodist Protestant minister formed a small religious society that worshipped in an old log schoolhouse near York Center. Until 1844, the group met both in the schoolhouse and in a private residence, but in the latter year a decision was made to build a frame church building. Growth over the next thirty years prompted the construction of a larger building on 1877, at a cost of $5,000; fully $3,000 of this total was donated by one woman, Mary Ford, from whose name was derived the church's nickname of \\"Mary's Chapel\\".History of Medina County and Ohio.

Systemic functional linguistics is functional and semantic rather than formal and syntactic in its orientation. As a functional linguistic theory, it claims that both the emergence of grammar and the particular forms that grammars take should be explained \\"in terms of the functions that language evolved to serve\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 1994. \\"Systemic Theory\\". In R.E. Asher (ed) Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, Vol 8. Pergamon Press. Reprinted in full in Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On Language and Linguistics: Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London: Continuum p. 436. While languages vary in how and what they do, and what humans do with them in the contexts of human cultural practice, all languages are considered to be shaped and organised in relation to three functions, or metafunctions. Michael Halliday, the founder of systemic functional linguistics, calls these three functions the ideational, interpersonal, and textual. The ideational function is further divided into the experiential and logical. Metafunctions are systemic clusters; that is, they are groups of semantic systems that make meanings of a related kind. The three metafunctions are mapped onto the structure of the clause. For this reason, systemic linguists analyse a clause from three perspectives. Halliday argues that the concept of metafunction is one of a small set of principles that are necessary to explain how language works; this concept of function in language is necessary to explain the organisation of the semantic system of language.Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. Function is considered to be \\"a fundamental property of language itself\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Language, context and text: Aspects of language as social semiotic. Geelong: Deakin University Press. Chapter 2. p. 17 According to Ruqaiya Hasan, the metafunctions in SFL \\"are not hierarchised; they have equal status, and each is manifested in every act of language use: in fact, an important task for grammatics is to describe how the three metafunctions are woven together into the same linguistic unit\\".Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9] Hasan argues that this is one way in which Halliday's account of the functions of language is different from that of Karl B√ºhler, for example, for whom functions of language are hierarchically ordered, with the referential function the most important of all. For Buhler, the functions were considered to operate one at a time. In SFL, the metafunctions operate simultaneously, and any utterance is a harmony of choices across all three functions.Hasan, R. 2009. Wanted: a theory for integrated sociolinguistics. London: Equinox. p. 9].  Ideational function The ideational function is language concerned with building and maintaining a theory of experience. It includes the experiential function and the logical function.  Experiential function  The experiential function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to make meanings about the world around us and inside us: :\\"Most obviously, perhaps, when we watch small children interacting with the objects around them we can see that they are using language to construe a theoretical model of their experience. This is language in the experiential function; the patterns of meaning are installed in the brain and continue to expand on a vast scale as each child, in cahoots with all those around, builds up, renovates and keeps in good repair the semiotic \\"reality\\" that provides the framework of day-to-day existency and is manifested in every moment of discourse, spoken or listened to. We should stress, I think, that the grammar is not merely annotating experience; it is construing experience.\\"Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the \\"architecture\\" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. pp. 15‚Äì16 Halliday argues that it was through this process of humans making meaning from experience that language evolved. Thus, the human species had to \\"make sense of the complex world in which it evolved: to classify, or group into categories, the objects and events within its awareness\\". These categories are not given to us through our senses; they have to be \\"construed\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 1999. Grammar and the construction of educational knowledge. In The Language of Early Childhood. Volume 4 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 355. In taking this position on the active role of grammar in construing \\"reality\\", Halliday was influenced by Whorf. Logical function Halliday describes the logical function as those systems \\"which set up logical‚Äìsemantic relationships between one clausal unit and another\\"Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the \\"architecture\\" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 17 The systems which come under the logical function are and . When two clauses are combined, a speaker chooses whether to give both clauses equal status, or to make one dependent on the other. In addition, a speaker chooses some meaning relation in the process of joining or binding clauses together. Halliday argues that the meanings we make in such processes are most closely related to the experiential function. For this reason, he puts the experiential and logical functions together into the ideational function.Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the \\"architecture\\" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 18 Interpersonal function The interpersonal function refers to the grammatical choices that enable speakers to enact their complex and diverse interpersonal relations. This tenet of systemic functional linguistics is based on the claim that a speaker not only talks about something, but is always talking to and with others. Language not only construes experience, but simultaneously acts out \\"the interpersonal encounters that are essential to our survival\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. On the \\"architecture\\" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Equinox. p. 16 Halliday argues that these encounters: :\\"range all the way from the rapidly changing microencounters of daily life ‚Äì most centrally, semiotic encounters where we set up and maintain complex patterns of dialogue ‚Äì to the more permanent institutionalized relationships that collectively constitute the social bond.\\" The grammatical systems that relate to the interpersonal function include Mood, Modality, and Polarity.Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. An Introduction to Functional Grammar. London: Arnold. Textual function Halliday argues that both experiential and interpersonal functions are intricately organized, but that between the two \\"there is comparatively very little constraint\\". This means that \\"by and large, you can put any interactional 'spin' on any representational content\\". What allows meanings from these two modes to freely combine is the intercession of a third, distinct mode of meaning that Halliday refers to as the textual function. The term encompasses all of the grammatical systems responsible for managing the flow of discourse. These systems \\"create coherent text ‚Äì text that coheres within itself and with the context of situation\\" They are both structural (involving choices relating to the ordering of elements in the clause), and non-structural (involving choices that create cohesive ties between units that have no structural bond). The relevant grammatical systems include Theme, Given and New,Halliday, M.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. Matthiessen. 2004. An Introduction to Functional Grammar. Arnold as well as the systems of cohesion, such as Reference, Substitution, and Ellipsis.Halliday, M.A.K. and Hasan, R. 1976. Cohesion in English. London: Longman Halliday argues that the textual function is distinct from both the experiential and interpersonal because its object is language itself. Through the textual function, language \\"creates a semiotic world of its own: a parallel universe, or 'virtual reality' in modern terms\\".Halliday, M. A. K. (2003 [2001]). Is the grammar neutral?

Reaching around 2 m (7 ft) in length, it is a predominantly black snake coloured grey underneath. Taxonomy The Papuan black snake is one of several species in the genus Pseudechis commonly known as black snakes. It was described in 1878 by Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria in 1878 from material collected in southeastern New Guinea. A study of mitochondrial DNA showed the Papuan black snake to be the next closest relative to a pair of Australian species, Collett's Snake (P. collettii) and the blue-bellied black snake (P. guttatus), and is likely to have had its origins in Australia and diverged from a common ancestor in the Pliocene. Description A solidly built snake with a wide round head and slight neck, the Papuan black snake ranges from 1.2 to 1.7 m in length, with individuals occasionally exceeding 2 metres. The longest specimen recorded was 2.44 m. The head and upperparts are dull or glossy black, or occasionally dark brown, and underparts are blue-grey or gunmetal grey. The neck is whitish with yellow and grey tinges. The labial scales are sometimes pale around the mouth and front of head. Scalation The Papuan black snake has 19 to 21 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 205 to 239 ventral scales, 43 to 63 subcaudal scales, and a divided anal scale. Distribution and habitat The range is southern New Guinea, both in Papua New Guinea and West Papua province of Indonesia, as well as offshore islands. In Papua New Guinea, it has possibly already vanished from Port Moresby and Central Province and is declining in Western Province. It just enters Australian territory as it occurs on Boigu and Saibai Islands in far northern Torres Strait off the New Guinea coast. Destruction of its habitat, killing of snakes by locals, and poisoning by the introduced cane toad have contributed to its decline. Venom The venom of the Papuan black snake is the most potent of all members of the black snake genus Pseudechis. Unlike those of other black snakes, the venom is predominantly neurotoxic in its effects, with muscle weakness and paralysis ensuing within 2 to 21 hours of being bitten. This can be life-threatening and intubation may be required. It is slightly more toxic than the equatorial spitting cobra (Naja sumatrana) and three times less toxic than that of the taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus). A postsynaptic neurotoxin isolated has been given the name of papuantoxin-1, and can be treated with CSL black snake antivenom (used for the king brown snake (Pseudechis australis)). Although widely feared in Papua New Guinea's Central Province, it is responsible for only a small minority of snakebites, eclipsed by the more dangerous taipan. Identifying snakes after snakebite can be difficult as victims are often bitten while walking through long kunai grass and hence the snake is not seen clearly.The Mekeo people know it as auguma, \\"to bite again\\", from its habit of repeatedly biting. Some local people in New Guinea believe it and the taipan to be opposite sexes of the same species. The Kiwai people believe the snake to be an agent of a magic-man known as Ove- devenor who sends it to kill enemies. People bitten will often seek out another magic-man instead of going to a hospital, thus dangerously delaying treatment. The first to extract Papuan black snake venom for scientific purposes was Australian herpetologist Ken Slater in the mid-1950s. He sent it to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne for antivenom research.Mirtschin, P. (2006); \\"The pioneers of venom production for Australian antivenoms\\", in: Toxicon, Vol. 48, p. 899-918. Slater is in pages 911 and 912. Retrieved online, 13 July 2017.

He was born in Phoenix, Arizona to John A. and Lizzie Christina (N√©e Miller). As a student at the University of Kansas, he studied Astronomy and Physics, and was awarded a B.A. in 1921 then a Masters in 1923. His doctoral work in astrophysics was performed at the University of Chicago, where he was granted a Ph.D. in 1930 with a thesis concerning \\"the Relations Between the Observed Contours of Spectral Lines and the Physical Properties of the Stars\\". Elvey worked at the Yerkes Observatory and later served as astronomer-in-charge at McDonald Observatory. His research included investigating the spectra of stars, galactic light, aurorae, and the gegenschein. During 1939‚Äì40 he worked with fellow Yerkes Observatory astronomers Otto Struve (his former teacher) and Christine Westgate to study the rate of rotation in higher mass stars via spectroscopy. During World War II, he performed applied research into rocket ballistics at the California Institute of Technology. He then joined the China Lake U. S.

The Northern Territory boundaries are shared with the West Australian border, the South Australian border, and the Queensland border. History Map showing the creation of the colonies/states and mainland territories. 1788-1832 In 1788, Governor Phillip claimed the continent of Australia as far west as the 135th meridian east longitude (135¬∞ east) in accordance with his commission. (26 January 1788 - Map) On 16 July 1825, the western boundary of New South Wales was relocated to the line of 129¬∞ east to take in the new settlement at Melville Island. (16 July 1825 - Map). From 1825 to 1829 129¬∞ east was the NSW border. Following the settlement of the Swan River Colony in 1829 (2 May 1829 - Map), its eastern boundary was declared to be 129¬∞ east, coinciding with the western boundary of New South Wales at the time. The colony of Western Australia (WA) was commissioned in March 1831. From 1829 to 1832, the SRC/NSW border was at 129¬∞ east. 1832-1836 The name of the Swan River Colony was changed to Western Australia in 1832 (6 February 1832 - Map).Territorial evolution of Australia - 6 February 1832 From 1832 to 1846, 129¬∞ east was the WA/NSW border. 1836-1846 South Australia became a colony in 1836 and until 1846 would be surrounded on land by New South Wales (NSW), with South Australia extending west to the 132¬∞ east longitude.

The 127-metre section that runs east‚Äìwest along the 26¬∞ south is part of the border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory.

Over time, a long list of notable people from a range of backgrounds began and continue to lend their support or make reference to the Occupy movement in general. Domestic political responses have been both positive and critical, from the President of the United States to the 2012 presidential candidates. International responses have come from the Egyptian protesters of Tahrir Square, Cardinal Peter Turkson, the Chinese state news agency (Xinhua), Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and many others. Most international responses have been supportive of the movement, while some, such as former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair have criticized it. Public opinion National polls from October to December 2011 were mixed, with agreement/approval ratings for Occupy Wall Street varying from 59% to 22%. On December 19, MSNBC reported a study which showed small-business owners \\"are almost evenly split on whether they support the protest movement.\\"Business Owners Divided on Occupy Wall Street - Business - nbcnews.com November 19, 2011, Retrieved 12/18/11 Among the general public, opinions of OWS have varied over time, and there are contradictions between the data collected by various polling agencies. September-October 2011 An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey released October 12 found that 37 percent of respondents \\"tend to support\\" the occupy movement, while 18 percent \\"tend to oppose\\" it. An October 13 survey by TIME magazine found that 54 percent of Americans have a favorable impression of the protests, while 23 percent have a negative impression. An October 18 Gallup poll found that 22 percent of Americans agree with the protest's goals, while 15 percent disapprove and the remaining 61% say they don't know enough to decide. Gallup found that Democrats, Independents and Republicans all follow the news about OWS in equal numbers, and those who closely followed OWS were also those who were more likely to approve of its goals and methods. An October CBS News/New York Times polls found 43% of Americans agree with Occupy Wall Street while 27% disagree. An October Rasmussen poll found an almost even split, shows that 33 percent of Americans have a favorable view, while 27 percent are unfavorable and 40 percent have no opinion. A Pew poll taken October 20‚Äì23 had similar findings, with 39% supporting \\"the Occupy Wall Street movement,\\" while 35% opposed.Pew Research Center, \\"Public Divided Over Occupy Wall Street Movement,\\" October 24, 2011. An October United Technologies/National Journal Congressional poll found that 59 percent of Americans agree with the movement while 31 percent disagree. An October Quinnipiac University poll of New York City voters found that 67 percent of New Yorkers approved of the movement with 23 percent disapproving. The results also found 87 percent of New Yorkers find it OK that they are protesting. Despite media criticism that the protesters views are incoherent, the poll also found that 72 percent of New York City voters understand their views. November-December 2011 A NY1-Marist Poll released show of November 1ed 44 percent of New York voters supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while only 21 percent supported the Tea Party. A survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted from November 10 to 14 found that majorities of nearly identical size felt that Occupy Wall Street, and the Tea Party, respectively, did not share their values. A November 3 poll done by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 30 percent of American voters have a favorable view of the protests, while 39 percent do not. The same poll found that among independent voters, 29 percent have a favorable view opposed to 42 percent who have an unfavorable view, while 45% of Democrats have a favorable view opposed to 19% who have an unfavorable view. A Pew Research Center poll, released December 15, 2011, found that nearly three months after the start of OWS, 44% support the Occupy Wall Street movement and 35% oppose it. Americans overwhelmingly agree with the concerns raised by the movement, but more disapprove of the tactics used than approve.Pew Research Center, \\"Frustration with Congress Could Hurt Republican Incumbents\\" December 15, 2011. Section Two: \\"Occupy Wall Street and Inequality,\\" page 11 According to a November Wall Street Journal article, the age group that most strongly supported OWS were 50 to 64, and OWS had the strongest support among those making $50,000 to $70,000 a year, rather than under $30,000, with only 27% of people making over $75,000 a year backing the movement. Managers and other professionals supported the movement more than blue-collar workers, and men over 50 showed the strongest support.Populist Movements Rooted in Same Soil The Wall Street Journal By GERALD F. SEIB, November 15, 2011 \\"You know how they have been pigeonholed: The tea-party movement is nothing but a collection of right-wing, under- educated rubes and radicals, while the Occupy Wall Street movement attracts only young, scruffy, unemployed left-wing zealots.\\" These findings were contradicted by a December Pew Poll, which found opposition to OWS \\"higher in the older and affluent\\" while those making under $75,000 a year and those under 29 were the most supportive. The Pew poll (published Dec. 15) also found more support than opposition in Democrats (60/21) and Independents (46/34), and more opposition than support in Republicans (21/59).Pew Research Center, \\"Frustration with Congress Could Hurt Republican Incumbents\\" December 15, 2011. Section Two: \\"Occupy Wall Street and Inequality,\\" page 12 In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, pollster Douglas Schoen wrote that polling of the protesters revealed \\"values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people\\" and have \\"a deep commitment to left-wing policies: opposition to free-market capitalism and support for radical redistribution of wealth, intense regulation of the private sector, and protectionist policies to keep American jobs from going overseas\\", and that politicians who support them will be hurt in the 2012 elections. Journalist David Weigel responded in an opinion piece published on Slate characterizing Schoen's opinion piece as \\"a dishonest column full of claims that couldn't be backed up by his own research\\", while Washington Monthly lead blogger Steve Benen wrote an opinion piece accusing Schoen of political spin in his analysis and referring to Schoen, a frequent contributor to Fox News, as \\"the quintessential 'Fox News Democrat'\\". Political response The White House During an October 6 news conference, President Barack Obama said, \\"I think it expresses the frustrations the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country ... and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on the abusive practices that got us into this in the first place.\\" When Jake Tapper of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, \\"One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless.\\" On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said \\"in some ways, they're not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party. Both on the left and the right, I think people feel separated from their government. They feel that their institutions aren't looking out for them.\\" On November 22, President Barack Obama was interrupted at a speech in New Hampshire by a group of Occupy Wall Street protesters who attempted to chant slogans during the speech; the protesters later delivered a paper message to the press, which read, \\"Mr. President: Over 4,000 peaceful protesters have been arrested while bankers continue to destroy the economy. You must stop the assault on our First Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out.\\" The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of \\"Obama!\\" Obama then responded, \\"I appreciate you guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine.\\" Later in the speech, Obama said, \\"Families like yours, young people like the ones here today ‚Äî including the ones who were just chanting at me ‚Äî you're the reason that I ran for office in the first place.\\" Vice President Joe Biden likened the protest to the Tea Party's similar anger at the banks, saying, \\"Look, guys, the bargain is not on the level anymore in the minds of the vast majority of the American (people). The middle class has been screwed.\\" Congress House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va), at the Values Voter Summit House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi said she supports the growing nationwide Occupy Wall Street movement. Pelosi said she includes herself in the group of Americans dissatisfied with Congress and stated, \\"I support the message to the establishment, whether it's Wall Street or the political establishment and the rest, that change has to happen. We cannot continue in a way (that) is not relevant to their lives.\\" Independent Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democratic Party, appeared on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and supported the protests saying, \\"We desperately need a coming together of working people to stand up to Wall Street. We need to rebuild the middle-class in this country and you guys can't have it all.\\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va), in a speech to a Values Voter Summit, characterized the movement as \\"growing mobs\\" and said that Obama's \\"failed policies\\" and rhetoric \\"condon[ing] the pitting of Americans against Americans\\" were to blame. In response, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney accused Cantor of \\"unbound\\" hypocrisy, given the Majority Leader's support of the Tea Party protests, adding, \\"I don't understand why one man's mob is another man's democracy.\\" Carney characterized both movements as examples of American democratic traditions. The Democratic co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Representatives Ra√∫l Grijalva and Keith Ellison, announced their solidarity with the movement on October 4.\\"CPC Co-Chairs Applaud Occupy Wall Street Movement\\". Congressional Progressive Caucus. October 4, 2011.

Romney later expressed sympathy for the movement, saying, \\"I look at what's happening on Wall Street and my view is, boy, I understand how those people feel.\\" Gary Johnson meeting Occupy Wall Street protesters in Zuccotti Park Former Governor of New Mexico and 2012 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson visited Occupy Wall Street in October 2011 and expressed support, stating \\"This country is not equal. We don't treat everyone equally. I would like to see us focus on the root cause, which is in my estimation politicians that are getting paid off. That's the corporatism and the outrage.\\" Speaking at a rally which had been disrupted by shouting Occupy Wall Street protestors, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum responded, \\"People are allowed to protest and we respect their opinion. We just happen to believe that folks who are at public rallies should let both sides to be heard,\\" and later commented, \\"Something that maybe these folks over here could ... maybe working a little bit instead of coming to these events and screaming at people.\\" Former Speaker of the House of Representatives and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich was quoted as saying at the 2012 Bloomberg/Washington Post Debate, > Let me draw a distinction. Virtually every American has a reason to be > angry. I think virtually [every] American has a reason to be worried. I > think the people who are protesting in Wall Street break into two groups: > one is left-wing agitators who would be happy to show up next week on any > other topic, and the other is sincere middle-class people who frankly are > very close to the Tea Party people who care. And actually ... you can tell > which are which. The people who are decent, responsible citizens pick up > after themselves. The people who are just out there as activists trash the > place and walk off and are proud of having trashed it, so let's draw that > distinction. U.S. Congressman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul (R-TX) stated, \\"If they were demonstrating peacefully, and making a point, and arguing our case, and drawing attention to the Fed‚ÄîI would say, 'good!'\\"\\"Paul supports anti-Wall Street protests\\". TheHill.com. October 3, 2011. In a GOP debate, mentioning the ongoing \\"Occupy Wall Street\\" protesters, he stated that crony capitalists are those \\"that benefit from contract from government, benefit from the Federal Reserve, benefit from all the bailouts. They don't deserve compassion. They deserve taxation or they deserve to have all their benefits removed.\\" When protesters conducted a 'mic check,' at one of Ron Paul's rallies, he replied, \\"If you listen carefully, I'm very much involved with the 99. I've been condemning that 1% because they've been ripping us off. The people on Wall Street got the bailouts and you guys got stuck with the bills and that's where I see the problem is.\\" Jill Stein, a 2012 Green Party (GPUS) presidential candidate, has strongly and consistently voiced support for the Occupy Wall Street movement. On October 9, prior to announcing her candidacy, she visited occupied Dewey Square in Boston, where she thanked the protesters for \\"breaking through the sound barrier,\\" established by the \\"conglomerate media\\" which, according to her, have silenced those who have tried to speak out against injustice. Former 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain accused the movement of being \\"anti-capitalist\\" and argued \\"Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself!\\"\\"Herman Cain Tells Occupy Wall Street Protesters to 'Blame Yourself'\\". ABC News. October 5, 2011. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Cain also expressed his belief that Occupy Wall Street was \\"planned and orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama administration,\\" but admitted that he \\"[didn't] have facts\\" to back up his accusation. Other politicians and political groups Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that the protests \\"aren't productive,\\" although he also expressed sympathy for some of their complaints. On October 8, during his weekly radio show, Bloomberg said that the protesters are trying to \\"take the jobs from the people working in the city,\\" and said that although \\"[t]here are some people with legitimate complaints, there are some people who just like to protest.\\" In an interview with The Washington Post, Former Democratic U.S. Senator Russ Feingold endorsed the movement on October 5 stating, \\"This is like the Tea Party‚Äîonly it's real ... By the time this is over, it will make the Tea Party look like ... a tea party.\\"\\"Russ Feingold endorses Occupy Wall Street: 'This will make the Tea Party look like...a tea party.'\\". The Washington Post. October 5, 2011 Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that the demonstrations of the OWS movement were \\"as American as apple pie,\\" adding \\"\\"This is something that our political leaders need to think about. It isn't enough just to scream at our Occupy Wall Street demonstrators ‚Äî we need our political system to start reflecting this anger back into how do we fix it? How do we get the economy going again?\\" Former President Bill Clinton was quoted in Forbes magazine saying, \\"Occupy Wall Street has done more in the short time they've been out there than I've been able to do in more than the last eleven years trying to draw attention to some of the same problems we have to address.\\" Former Vice President Al Gore offered his support for the Occupy movement in an October 12 blog post, writing: \\"From the economy to the climate crisis our leaders have pursued solutions that are not solving our problems, instead they propose policies that accomplish little. With democracy in crisis a true grassroots movement pointing out the flaws in our system is the first step in the right direction. Count me among those supporting and cheering on the Occupy Wall Street movement.\\" Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura expressed his support for the movement and attended an Occupy protest in Minneapolis. He also stated his belief that the movement should not be dictated by either party, stating > I think that I have to be the face of this movement; it can't be a Democrat > or a Republican because not only do I talk the talk I walk the walk. I never > took one dollar of corporate money. I never took one PAC dollar to become > governor of Minnesota.\\" He also went on saying that both the Democrats and > Republicans, both parties of which Ventura is known for being a staunch > critic of, had \\"sold themselves out to Wall Street. David Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and former one-term Republican Louisiana State Representative showed his support for what he called the \\"Occupy Zionist Wall Street\\" protesters. Duke said that \\"The Zionist media has their paid whores condemning the demonstrations across America against these criminal banks\\" (citing Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly as specific examples), adding that \\"I cheer the men and women in the streets condemning the international banks that hold America hostage.\\" Rocky Suhayda, chairman of the American Nazi Party, also supported protests, saying that: This was repeated by US conservative media (such as The Blaze and Fox Nation) in an attempt to discredit the Occupy movement. Media Matters for America (a US progressive media watchdog) commented that \\"If a Nazi says something nice about you, that doesn't make you a Nazi\\", drawing attention to Suhayda's support for George W. Bush in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and John McCain in 2008. Labor unions On October 5, 2011 members of the National Nurses United labor union march to Foley Square in support of OWS In September, various labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union of America Local 100 and the New York Metro 32BJ Service Employees International Union, pledged their support for demonstrators. Union leaders say that unions and OWS can offer mutual support, with OWS gaining from the union's money, stature, and large membership, and the weakened labor movement absorbing the protesters vitality.Seeking Energy, Unions Join Protest Against Wall Street By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and CARA BUCKLEY, October 5, 2011Times Topics, Occupy Wall Street background, retrieved November 12, 2011 The Industrial Workers of the World announced on September 28, 2011, that its General Executive Board (GEB), and the General Defense Committee (GDC) had issued statements of support for Occupy Wall Street.IWW.org Editor, IWW Endorses Occupy Wall Street retrieved October 22, 2011IWW.org Editor, IWW General Defense Committee Statement in Support of Occupy Wall Street retrieved October 22, 2011 After numerous arrests of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge, police commandeered city buses to pick up detained protesters and union drivers later sued the New York Police Department.

Our bus operators are not going to be pressed into service to arrest protesters anywhere\\". On October 4, representatives from more than 14 of the country's largest labor unions joined the protesters for a mass rally and march. In early November, National Nurses United (NNU), the largest union of registered nurses in the nation, expressed support for OWS and rallied in front of the White House and Department of Treasury. Karen Higgins, co- president of NNU, said, \\"A real finance tax would generate $350 billion a year in the U.S. alone and bring relief to families out of homes, friends out of work, patients out of care, communities running out of time. The tax starts a revenue flow back to the 99 percent.\\" Noting the growing union support, an article in the progressive-leaning Mother Jones magazine said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are \\"a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought.\\" However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that \\"effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics.\\" As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL‚ÄìCIO's policy director, said, \\"We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what's going on in our country right now. The fact that they've figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.\\" The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, \\"We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other. The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.\\" Environmental response Several environmentalist leaders supported Occupy Wall Street. In 2011, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford expressed Occupy Wall Street, stating:: \\"We stand ‚Äì as individuals and an organization ‚Äì with Occupiers of all walks of life who peacefully stand up for a just, democratic, green and peaceful future.\\"Phil Radford, \\"Greenpeace Supports Occupy Wall Street Peaceful Protests\\" Bill McKibben of 350.org stated: \\"The reason that it's so great that we're occupying Wall Street is because Wall Street has been occupying the atmosphere.\\" Sarah Hodgdon of the Sierra Club stated: \\"Many Sierra Club staff and volunteer leaders have participated in and/or lent support to these demonstrations standing up for the end to corporate greed. The demands and values of the protesters are very much in line with Sierra Club's strategic priority of confronting the power of the coal and oil industries.\\" Federal Reserve response During a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, \\"[P]eople are quite unhappy with the state of the economy and what's happening. They blame, with some justification, the problems in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and they're dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington.

That was obviously not the case.\\" Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard W.

Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher.

As a plainclothes officer, he was referred to as the \\"hipster cop\\" for his attire consisting of glasses, cardigan sweaters, skinny ties and skinny trousers. Reaction to his presence was mixed. It was reported that during the park occupation Occupy Wall Street paid the Police Department $17 million in overtime.

An image of Luke Skywalker holding a protest sign was published: \\"It wasn't glamorous but I had a steady living working on my uncle's moisture farm ... my aunt and uncle were unjustly murdered and the farm destroyed. I was forced to leave my home and join an extinct cult just to survive. I am now a member of an upstart movement to take down a greedy corrupt establishment.

Parodies relating to Middle Earth include a woman who had written her complaint in Elvish, allegedly translated: \\"I spend every waking hour fighting Orcs while Elrond and Galadriel eat lembas bread all day. I am the 99%.\\" Other parodies include Occupy Narnia and Occupy Sesame Street. Occupy Sesame Street went viral and, following violent encounters between NYPD and the protesters, Tumblr posted pictures of Elmo arrested, Grover restrained, and Count von Count pepper-sprayed. Occupy Wall Street and its related protests were satirized in the South Park episode \\"1%\\", which aired on November 2, 2011. Remy Munasifi wrote and sang a song called \\"Occupy Wall Street Protest Song\\", which criticized the protestors for not understanding, in his opinion, how well off they are. According to AFP, the song went viral in early October.Remy's Occupy Wall Street Protest Song, Reason magazine, October 10, 2011Occupy Wall Street gets a theme song ... sort of, AFP, October 11, 2011 Popular culture images are also employed by protesters to make statements. For example, Guy Fawkes masks from the graphic novel V for Vendetta (and the feature film of the same name) are worn by protesters in New York and around the world as visual symbols of resistance against corporate greed. Despite Rush Limbaugh's claims about The Dark Knight Rises being a critique of Mitt Romney, the film was also analogous to Occupy Wall Street. The film was inspired by Darth Vader in the characterization of its villain Bane, who had significantly deviated from the source material, similarly to other characters of Christopher Nolan's trilogy about Batman. In addition, the film was released in the same year when Romney was campaigning for the presidential election, with Bain Capital, a company where Romney was extensively involved as a co-founder, had presumably influenced Bane as the film's main antagonist. Batman's consistent comparisons to Darth Vader could connect Bane to Palpatine, who was a politician seeking power like Romney while actor Liam Neeson had portrayed the mentors of both Darth Vader and Batman, specifically Qui-Gon Jinn in The Phantom Menace and Ra's al Ghul in Batman Begins, respectively. Music videos On October 26, 2011, the first video setting footage of Occupy Wall Street to the song Love, That's America by Melvin Van Peebles was uploaded to YouTube. In an interview with Van Peebles several weeks later, he discussed the song going viral. Turkish newspaper Radikal described the song as becoming the surprising unofficial anthem of the movement. On January 17, 2012, Van Peebles performed at the Players' Club to honor the fact that the song has become a theme for the Occupy Wall Street movement.http://www.cliclocwatch.com/2012/01/legendary- musician-and-filmaker-melvin-van-peebles/ On February 22, 2012, Van Peebles commented further, \\"When I found out that the song had been co-opted by Occupy Wall Street, my jaw dropped. It went viral online. People were remixing it and mashing it up with videos from the protests. The time I wrote it was a time of social upheaval ‚Äî the Stonewall Riots had just happened.

Career DeVore began his writing career in the late 1960s on shows like Chuck Barris' The Newlywed Game, The Steve Allen Show, and Tempo.  Personal life and death  DeVore married the singer Maria Cole (1969‚Äì1978) and the actresses Sandie Newton (1981‚Äì1985), Claudia Christian (1988‚Äì1992), and Wendy DeVore (1996‚Äì1997). DeVore disappeared in June 1997, while driving at night from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Santa Barbara, California, prompting an extensive search and media speculation. DeVore was working in his office in Santa Fe, New Mexico trying to finish a script. DeVore had recently complained of writer's block, and so had decided to change his environment. When he finally finished the script, DeVore decided to drive home through the Mojave Desert. His wife Wendy DeVore was waiting for him at their beachfront house in Carpinteria, California. When she didn't hear from him she decided to call around 1 am, a call which it was later discovered to have not been recorded by the telephone company. He answered, but was not very specific on his location. This was the last time Wendy spoke with him. A year later, he and his car were discovered submerged below a bridge over the Aqueduct in Palmdale, California. Once the police had retrieved the vehicle from the water, it was found that his laptop containing the script (entitled \\"The Big Steal\\"), his hands, and his gun were missing. This was considered very suspicious, as the aqueduct was searched when the disappearance was initially reported, and it had showed no signs of impact at the time. Police concluded that for DeVore to crash his vehicle in this location meant that he would have had to have driven three miles against traffic without being seen. This would have been doubly difficult as the vehicle's lights were not switched on. Gary DeVore's murder has not been solved to date. A multimedia project, The Writer with No Hands, posited that DeVore's death was the result of a US government conspiracy.

Born in Auckland, Stott volunteered for the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War. Serving with an artillery unit, Stott took part in the Battle of Greece, and the subsequent Battle of Crete. Captured by the Germans on Crete, he successfully escaped from a prisoner of war camp after several months of internment. Making his way back to Egypt, he joined the Special Operations Executive in 1942 and was dispatched to Greece to support the local resistance efforts against the Germans. In 1944, he transferred to the Z Special Unit, which was based in Melbourne, Australia as part of the Services Reconnaissance Department. Appointed commander of Robin 1, a small team formed to collect intelligence in the Southwest Pacific, he disappeared, presumed drowned, on 20 March 1945 while leading his team on a reconnaissance mission to Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia. Early life Born on 23 October 1914, Stott was the son of a butcher in Birkenhead in Auckland. Educated at Northcote Primary School and then at Takapuna Grammar School, Stott was a keen sportsman. Upon finishing his education, he was employed at the New Zealand Herald as a rotary machinist.McDonald 1991, p. 6 Second World War Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Stott enlisted in the New Zealand Military Forces in December 1939 and volunteered for the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). Posted to 5th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, he was quickly promoted to sergeant. In 1940, he embarked with the 2nd Echelon of the 2nd Division,McDonald 1991, p. 6 which had been formed from the personnel of the 2NZEF, for Egypt. However, during transit the ship on which he was traveling, the Aquitania, was diverted to England.Bates 1955, pp. 23‚Äì24 In March 1941, Stott was shipped with the 2nd Echelon to Egypt to join up with the 1st Echelon of the 2nd Division, which had been in the country since February 1940,Bates 1955, pp. 8‚Äì10 and then onto Greece to take part in the defence of Greece. The New Zealanders, together with other Allied forces, were forced to retreat to the island of Crete following the German intervention in Greece. He was wounded and captured during the subsequent Battle of Crete. Stott described the wound in a letter home as being '\\"not at all severe. I was hit by a bullet just above the knee (right) on the inside of the leg and it did not strike a bone so I was lucky\\", and it was not so serious as to prevent him escaping a prisoner of war camp in Greece. Together with another New Zealander, Bob Morton, Stott vaulted the fence of the camp in broad daylight and successfully evaded the German guards with the help of Greek police who led the pursuing Germans astray. After spending several months in and around Athens,McDonald 1991, p. 8 Stott and Morton were eventually able to get to Egypt, crossing the Mediterranean by sailboat.McDonald 1991, p. 9 Special Operations Executive Following recuperation from his adventures in Greece, Stott was posted to Officer Training School (OTC). It was during his time at OTC that he was asked to conduct sabotage missions in Greece for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a request he gladly accepted.McDonald 1991, p. 10 However, Stott, by now commissioned as an officer, initially began working for SOE at Bardia in Egypt, dealing with POWs who had escaped from Crete. In July 1942, he was part of the Post Occupational Force and, as the Allied situation in Egypt deteriorated, was tasked with the destruction of key facilities in the event German forces advance further.McDonald 1991, pp. 11‚Äì12 Greece Stott, increasingly frustrated that he had yet to reach Greece, sought a new role at SOE and was give charge of the Greek Section in the organisation.McDonald 1991, p. 13 With his fellow escapee, Bob Morton, he carried out some reconnaissance missions in North Africa and some islands off the coast of Greece, returning to Egypt each time. In March 1943, he, along with another SOE operative, Geoffrey Gordon-Creed, were parachuted into Greece. They were to join the British Military Mission that was then based in Greece and co-ordinate the Greek resistance efforts.McDonald 1991, pp. 15‚Äì19Field & Gordon-Creed 2011, p. 109 In June 1943, Stott, together with Gordon-Creed, destroyed the Asopos Viaduct.McDonald 1991, pp. 32‚Äì34 This was an important operation, as it resulted in the diversion of German troops destined for the frontlines to occupation duties in Greece. For his exploits, Stott was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO),Field & Gordon-Creed 2011, p. 143 after the commander of the British Military Mission in Greece, Brigadier Eddie Myers originally recommended Stott for a Victoria Cross (VC). Myers considered that the VC would have been awarded had a shot been fired during the Asopos mission.McDonald 1991, p. vii Remaining in Greece and continuing his sabotage operations, Stott received a head wound when blowing up a bridge and was forced seek medical help from acquaintances in Athens.McDonald 1991, pp. 36‚Äì37 Now based in Athens and tasked with the sabotage of aerodromes around the capital, Stott was able to get the various factions of the Greek resistance to work together. The main resistance groups in Greece were the EDES, a rightist resistance group and the communist controlled Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS), the military wing of the National Liberation Front (Ethnik√≥ Apeleftherotik√≥ M√©topo or EAM).Clogg 2006, pp. 149‚Äì156 However, his relations with EAM became very difficult as he accused the group of seeking to hinder his work, describing his EAM liaison as \\"violently Bolshevistic and anti-British\\".Clogg 2006, p. 149 Stott pressured all of the non-communist resistance groups to work together to prevent EAM from coming to power after the war, promising them arms and money. The planned sabotage operations came to nothing as it was realised the targeted aerodromes were too well defended. His efforts to co-ordinate the Greek resistance meant that Stott became embroiled in the internal power struggle between the various Greek resistance groups. Reputedly a staunch anti-communist, Stott favoured working with the EDES rather than ELAS. Greek SOE operatives became concerned that Stott was being manipulated by his EDES contacts, some of whom were of questionable character. Many of the Greek officers Stott met were ethnikophron (\\"nationally-minded\\"), a Greek expression meaning someone with ultra- nationalist views. One of Stott's principle contacts was Colonel Georgios Grivas of Organization X, a Cypriot-born Greek army officer of extreme right- wing views. Many of the ethnikophron officers Stott met, such as Grivas, had links with both the puppet Hellenic State governed by Ioannis Rallis and the Germans. Moreover, in the Athens, among the ethnikophron officers, there was what the British historian Mark Mazower called a \\"murky\\" world where those who professed to be engaged in resistance could just as easily be engaged in collaboration with the Germans under the grounds that EAM constituted a greater threat. Many members of the Athens branch of EDES joined the Security Battalions, which supported the German occupation.Mazower 1993, p. 329 Matters came to a head in November 1943, when the mayor of Athens contacted Stott with back channel peace overtures from the Germans. While the approach was initially dismissed, Stott decided to explore the opportunity in order to collect useful intelligence on Germany's position in Greece. Stott met with key representatives of the Gestapo and, as negotiations became more protracted, Stott began to take them seriously. Stott's initial contacts were with Roman Loos, the Austrian policeman in charge of the Geheime Feldpolizei (Secret Field Police) operations in the Balkans, who passed on the message that Germany wanted to end the war with Britain to focus on the Soviet Union, which Loos argued was the common enemy of both Britain and the Reich.Clogg 2006, p. 151 On the night of 4 November 1943, Stott, dressed in the uniform of a British Army officer, met with Loos and the diplomat Dr. Rudi St√§rker on a deserted street in Athens that was screened by gunmen from one of the right- wing Greek groups backed by the Germans whom Stott had talking to.Clogg 2006, pp. 151‚Äì152 St√§rker was a deputy of Hermann Neubacher of the Ausw√§rtiges Amt, who played a key role in governing the Balkans. St√§rker asserted to Stott that the Soviet Union was the enemy of \\"Western civilization\\", and therefore Britain should join forces with Germany to save the West. The meeting went well, and afterwards Loos declared that Stott could travel around Greece dressed in his officer's uniform.Clogg 2006, p. 152 In message to the SOE headquarters in Cairo on 7 November 1943, Stott described meeting Loos, whom he called \\"Loss\\" and mistakenly called him \\"the Gestapo chief of the Balkans\\", saying that Loos had direct contact with his fellow Austrian Adolf Hitler.Clogg 2006, p. 153 Stott asked the Germans to arrange for the Security Battalions to switch over to serving the Greek government-in-exile when it returned to Greece as Stott asserted to his German hosts that his government did not want EAM to come to power under any conditions. As the talks progressed, Neubacher met with Stott to discuss possible Anglo-German co- operation in the Balkans, which might led to Britain switching sides to ally herself with Germany against the Soviet Union. Stott told Neubacher: \\"This war should end in the common struggle by the Allies and German forces against Bolshevism\\". Stott apologised to Nuebacher for Britain supplying EAM with arms, and stated his belief that: \\"communist infiltration is already a serious threat in the Mediterranean\\".Eudes 1973, p. 108 Stott repeatedly stressed to his German hosts that he regarded the Soviet Union as the real enemy, and felt that Britain was fighting on the wrong side. One of Stott's Greek contacts denounced him to the SOE headquarters in Cairo, charging that he was engaged in treasonous talks. Stott's talks with the Germans had a disastrous impact on Britain's relations with EAM, who believed that he was acting under orders of London.Mazower 1993, pp. 328‚Äì329 It was widely believed in Greece that when the unpopular King George II returned from exile, he would pardon all of the members of the Security Battalions to use them to fight against EAM. Stott's talks in Athens had also led to much hope in Germany that the alliance of the \\"Big Three\\" powers was falling apart and that soon Britain would be switching sides.Mazower 1993, p. 328 In a speech on 20 April 1944 to mark Hitler's birthday, Walter Schimana, the Higher SS Police Chief of Greece, referred to the Stott mission as a sign that Germany would win the war against the Soviet Union allied with Britain. The British historian Mark Mazower wrote in 1993 that the official line of the British government is that Stott was a \\"rouge agent\\" acting without orders, but he also noted that Stott remained in radio contact with the SOE headquarters in Cairo during his talks with the Germans and that the unpopular commander of SOE in Cairo, Brigadier Keble, encouraged Stott in his negotiations.McDonald 1991, p. 43 However, on 8 November 1943, SOE headquarters in Cairo sent Stott a message stating under no conditions were SOE agents to negotiate with the Germans, and ordering him to break off his talks immediately. The Germans allowed Stott to leave Athens for Cairo in late November 1943 with a message from Loos indicating a desire to explore the possibility of peace in Greece but this was promptly dismissed.McDonald 1991, p. 44 Following a debriefing held in Cairo, Stott was awarded a bar to his DSO as a result of the useful intelligence he collected during the negotiations.Clogg 2006, pp. 149‚Äì156 Sir Reginald Leeper, an Australian who served as the British ambassador to the Greek government-in-exile and whose relations with the SOE had long been very difficult, demanded that Stott be banned from Greece permanently.Clogg 2006, p. 155 Z Special Unit The USS Perch, from which Stott launched his final mission Stott was not allowed to return to Greece following his recent exploits in the country. Instead, after being offered a staff job which was declined, he opted to be seconded to the Australian equivalent of the SOE, the Services Reconnaissance Department, to undertake operations in the Far East. Stott briefly returned to New Zealand where he married Mary Snow in June 1944.McDonald 1991, pp. 46‚Äì47 The following month, Stott commenced intensive training at various bases around Australia, including receiving instructions in small boat handling and submarine insertion. In 1945, and by now promoted to major, he was appointed commander of Operation Robin 1 and tasked with conducting sabotage and intelligence missions in Southeast Borneo. A submarine, the USS Perch, transported Stott and his twelve-man team to Japanese occupied Balikpapan Bay. Arriving in the bay on 20 March 1945, Stott was to lead an initial party of four ashore in a pair of two-man folboats.Wigzell 2001, pp. 111‚Äì130 This was to be followed by the remainder of his team two days later.Wigzell 2001, pp. 111‚Äì130 Launching at night in heavy swells, Stott had trouble with the motor of his folboat, and he and his companion were forced to use paddles to try to get to shore. En route, the party was detected by the Japanese and were ordered by Stott to seek an alternative landing site. While the second folboat successfully made it to shore, Stott and his companion were never seen again, and were presumed to have drowned.Wigzell 2001, pp. 111‚Äì130 Notes References    * Category:1914 births Category:1945 deaths Category:People from Auckland Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:New Zealand prisoners of war in World War II Category:Special Operations Executive personnel Category:Z Special Unit personnel Category:New Zealand military personnel killed in World War II Category:New Zealand Companions of the Distinguished Service Order ","title":"Donald Stott"},{"id":"34385258","text":"John Both Puok (c. 1963 ‚Äì January 9, 2012) was a South Sudanese politician.

Whalebone and his full-brother Whisker were produced by the prolific and important broodmare Penelope, and they contributed to the perpetuation of the genetic line (tail-male) of their sire Waxy and grandsire Eclipse into the 20th century. Whalebone raced until he was six years old and was retired to stud at Petworth in 1815. Whalebone sired the Derby winners Lap-dog, Spaniel and may have been the sire of Moses. Other notable sons are Sir Hercules and Camel, the sire of Touchstone. Whalebone died in 1831 at the age of 24 of hemorrhage after covering a mare. Background Whalebone was bred by the Duke of Grafton in 1807 at his Euston Hall stud farm near Newmarket. He was sired by the 1793 Epsom Derby winner Waxy out of the mare Penelope (foaled in 1798), both owned by the Duke. As a racehorse, Penelope was a contemporary of the 1801 Derby-winning filly Eleanor, beating her several times, and was half-sister to 1809 Derby winner Pope and the mares Pope Joan (both sired by Waxy), Parasol (Partisan's dam) and Prudence. Penelope was a prolific and influential broodmare, producing eight full- siblings to Whalebone that achieved success on the turf. She produced 13 foals between 1806 and 1823, all with names beginning with the letter W. Whalebone was her second foal and his full-siblings include Web, Woful, Wilful, Wire, Whisker, Wildfire and Windfall. Penelope died in 1824. Whalebone was a mottled bay or brown colt that stood 15.2 hands high with \\"short legs, high-bred nostrils and very prominent eyes.\\" He was a \\"plainish looking\\" horse with a \\"Turkish-pony look\\" and thick neck and body that were not as well-proportioned as those of his full-brother Whisker. Whalebone was reportedly one of the smallest horses Waxy ever produced. In the words of his groom, Dryman, \\"he was the lowest and longest, and most-double jointed horse, with the best legs‚Äîeight and a half below the knee‚Äîand worst feet I ever saw in my life.\\" Racing career 1810: three-year-old season Whalebone's first career start occurred on 9 May at Newmarket where Whalebone ran a dead heat and won the 50-guinea Newmarket Stakes, beating the colts Brother to Burleigh (Treasurer) and Eccleston while carrying 119 pounds. On 7 June at Epsom, Whalebone won the Derby Stakes, beating The Dandy, Eccleston and a field of eight other horses after leading from the start in a race where he \\"was never headed.\\" He was the race favorite at 5 to 2, and his Derby win was a consecutive victory for the Duke of Grafton who had won the race the previous year with his colt Pope. Pope was also sired by Waxy and was out of Whalebone's maternal grandam Prunella. At the First October Meeting at Newmarket, Whalebone received a forfeiture of 60 guineas from Mr. Shakespear's colt Nuncio and walked over for a 25-guinea subscription stakes. On 29 October at Houghton, Whalebone was beaten in a match race by the colt Treasurer while carrying seven more pounds than his opponent. A few days later at the same meeting Whalebone secured two wins in match races, beating Major Wheatley's colt Sir Marrinel while carrying eight pounds more than his opponent and beating the colt Thorn a day later. He also received forfeitures of 100 guineas from Mr. Shakespear's Knave of Clubs and an unspecified amount from G. H. Cavendish's colt Florival. 1811: four-year-old season Earl of Egremont after his racing career and stood his entire breeding career at Petworth House. The horse statue on the table to the right of Egremont depicts Whalebone. In May, Whalebone received 60 guineas forfeiture from Mr. Henry Vansittart's colt Gloster. On 6 August at Huntingdon, Whalebone was third in the Portholme Stakes to the filly Barrosa and the colt Bolter. For the Newmarket Trial Stakes on 30 September, Whalebone was third to the colt Florival and the filly Sprightly. Whalebone won the 100-guinea King's Plate a few days later, and at the Second October Meeting, received a forfeit from major Wilson's colt Erebus and was unplaced for the Cheveley Stakes. In November he received 140 guineas forfeit from Mr. Shakespear's colt Tumbler. 1812‚Äì1813: five and six-year-old seasons At the Newmarket-Craven Meeting, Whalebone was beaten in a match race by Major Wilson's colt Bolter. In April at Newmarket, Whalebone won the 100-guinea King's Plate and was third in a 300-guinea sweepstakes race to the colts Trophonius (not the 2000 Guineas winner) and Invalid. In July at Newmarket, he won a ¬£50 race and paid a 10-guinea forfeit for a handicap sweepstakes. On 9 September at Northampton, Whalebone won a 100-guinea gold cup race against four other horses. Whalebone was sold by the Duke of Grafton in October 1812 to Mr. Ladbroke for 700 guineas. Whalebone's first start under Ladbroke's ownership was on 26 October at the Houghton meeting where he won a match race against Mr. Lake's two-year- old colt Turner. Whalebone won an additional match race against the Lord Sackville's horse Pan at the same meeting. Whalebone ran three times in 1813, winning the 100-guinea His Majesty's Plate on 8 June at Guildford against three other horses and the Lewes His Majesty's Plate on 5 August. On 7 August, in what was ultimately the last start of Whalebone's racing career, he won the 60-guinea Ladies' Plate against Lord Somerset's colt Offa's Dyke. Interim Ladbroke reportedly \\"took a dislike to Whalebone\\" and sold him in 1814 for 510 guineas to Lord Egremont. Whalebone was initially thought to be a poor stud prospect due to his small stature and Lord Egremont put him back into training. However, the seven-year-old horse had become \\"dangerous to ride,\\" having \\"acquired the habit of rearing to an alarming extent\\" and would frequently \\"knock his hooves together like a pair of castanettes.\\" Consequently, he was permanently retired from racing and became a breeding stallion for Lord Egremont in 1815. Stud career Whalebone began his stud career at Petworth in Sussex in 1815 for a fee of 10 guineas per mare and one guinea for the groom alongside the stallions Octavius and Canopus. His fee was 20 guineas per mare in 1830, the year preceding his death, and he stood at Petworth for the entirety of his 16-year stud career. Whalebone sired The Derby winners Lap-dog, Spaniel and may have been the sire of Moses. Other notable sons are Sir Hercules and Camel, the sire of Touchstone. In his later years, Whalebone developed chronic foot problems due to his poor hoof conformation. His groom, Dryman, commented on his condition, \\"His feet were so contracted and high on the heel, and became so Chinese boot-like and full of fever at last, that he never moved out of his box.\\" Whalebone \\"broke a blood vessel\\" on 5 February 1831 while breeding the mare Ogress. He died of this injury the following day on 6 February 1831. Ogress foaled a bay filly by Whalebone in 1832, later named Eleanor, the last foal sired by Whalebone.

The beginning of the trail is located in the Craft Centre, which in itself brings 90,000 visitors each year. The trail consists of ten spy holes, with 22 figures on buildings and roofs throughout the town to give a flavour of the history and folklore of Ruthin. These \\"spy holes\\" include various portrayals of Ruthin's history, from an illustration of the old livestock market, to the myth of a wild dog. Small metal figures have also been devised. The trail is designed to tour people around Ruthin, set out with oak benches and freshly planted trees which are designed to encourage people to explore the town further. The tourists would be led up Market Street, across St. Peter's square, down Clwyd Street which leads to the Old Gaol, and through a series of other streets that will take them back to Market Street. The art trail was designed by Lucy Strachan, who wanted to encourage people to discover the town of Ruthin. The artists and designers took advice from a former secondary school head teacher and local historian regarding Ruthin's heritage and legends.

It is largely based on the photoelectric effect. Free molecules from a gas-phase sample are ionized by incident vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. In the ensuing photoionization, a cation and a photoelectron are formed for each sample molecule. The mass of the photoion is determined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas, in current setups, photoelectrons are typically detected by velocity map imaging. Electron times-of-flight are three orders of magnitude smaller than ion ones, which means that the electron detection can be used as a time stamp for the ionization event, starting the clock for the ion time-of-flight analysis. In contrast with pulsed experiments, such as REMPI, in which the light pulse must act as the time stamp, this allows to use continuous light sources, e.g. a discharge lamp or a synchrotron light source. No more than several ion‚Äìelectron pairs are present simultaneously in the instrument, and the electron‚Äìion pairs belonging to a single photoionization event can be identified and detected in delayed coincidence.  History  A painting featuring the PEPICO endstation at the Swiss Light Source. Brehm and von Puttkammer published the first PEPICO study on methane in 1967. In the early works, a fixed energy light source was used, and the electron detection was carried out using retarding grids or hemispherical analyzers: the mass spectra were recorded as a function of electron energy. Tunable vacuum ultraviolet light sources have been used in later setups, in which fixed, mostly zero kinetic energy electrons are detected, and the mass spectra are recorded as a function of photon energy. Detecting zero kinetic energy or threshold electrons in threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy, TPEPICO, has two major advantages. Firstly, no kinetic energy electrons are produced in energy ranges with poor Franck‚ÄìCondon factors in the photoelectron spectrum, but threshold electrons can still be emitted via other ionization mechanisms. Second, threshold electrons are stationary and can be detected with higher collection efficiencies, thereby increasing signal levels. Threshold electron detection was first based line-of-sight, i.e. a small positive field is applied towards the electron detector, and kinetic energy electrons with perpendicular velocities are stopped by small apertures. The inherent compromise between resolution and collection efficiency was resolved by applying velocity map imaging conditions. Most recent setups offer meV or better (0.1 kJ mol‚àí1) resolution both in terms of photon energy and electron kinetic energy. The 5‚Äì20 eV (500‚Äì2000 kJ mol‚àí1, Œª = 250‚Äì60 nm) energy range is of prime interest in valence photoionization. Widely tunable light sources are few and far between in this energy range. The only laboratory based one is the H2 discharge lamp, which delivers quasi-continuous radiation up to 14 eV. The few high resolution laser setups for this energy range are not easily tunable over several eV. Currently, VUV beamlines at third generation synchrotron light sources are the brightest and most tunable photon sources for valence ionization. The first high energy resolution PEPICO experiment at a synchrotron was the pulsed-field ionization setup at the Chemical Dynamics Beamline of the Advanced Light Source.  Overview  Velocity map imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence apparatus. Electrons with different kinetic energies are shown as well as ions with a room temperature kinetic energy distribution. The primary application of TPEPICO is the production of internal energy selected ions to study their unimolecular dissociation dynamics as a function of internal energy. The electrons are extracted by a continuous electric field and are e.g. velocity map imaged depending on their initial kinetic energy. Ions are accelerated in the opposite direction and their mass is determined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The data analysis yields dissociation thresholds, which can be used to derive new thermochemistry for the sample. The electron imager side can also be used to record photoionization cross sections, photoelectron energy and angular distributions. With the help of circularly polarized light, photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) can be studied. A thorough understanding of PECD effects could help explain the homochirality of life. Flash pyrolysis can also be used to produce free radicals or intermediates, which are then characterized to complement e.g. combustion studies. In such cases, the photoion mass analysis is used to confirm the identity of the radical produced. Photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy can be used to shed light on reaction mechanisms, and can also be generalized to study double ionization in (photoelectron) photoion photoion coincidence ((PE)PIPICO), fluorescence using photoelectron photon coincidence (PEFCO), or photoelectron photoelectron coincidence (PEPECO). Time of flights of photoelectrons and photoions can be combined in a form of a map, which visualises the dynamics of the dissociative ionisation process.L J Frasinski, M Stankiewicz, K J Randall, P A Hatherly and K Codling \\"Dissociative photoionisation of molecules probed by triple coincidence; double time-of- flight techniques\\" J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Phys. 19 L819‚ÄìL824 (1986) open access Ion‚Äìelectron velocity vector correlation functions can be obtained in double imaging setups, in which the ion detector also delivers position information.  Energy selection  Potential energy diagram for dissociative photoionization. When only zero kinetic energy electrons are detected, the photon energy above the adiabatic ionization energy is converted into the internal energy of the photoion AB+ The relatively low intensity of the ionizing VUV radiation guarantees one-photon processes, in other words only one, fixed energy photon will be responsible for photoionization. The energy balance of photoionization comprises the internal energy and the adiabatic ionization energy of the neutral as well as the photon energy, the kinetic energy of the photoelectron and of the photoion. Because only threshold electrons are considered and the conservation of momentum holds, the last two terms vanish, and the internal energy of the photoion is known: :E_{\\\\text{int}}^{\\\\text{ion}} = E_{\\\\text{int}}^{\\\\text{neutral}} + h u - IE_{\\\\text{ad}} Scanning the photon energy corresponds to shifting the internal energy distribution of the parent ion. The parent ion sits in a potential energy well, in which the lowest energy exit channel often corresponds to the breaking of the weakest chemical bond, resulting in the formation of a fragment or daughter ion. A mass spectrum is recorded at every photon energy, and the fractional ion abundances are plotted to obtain the breakdown diagram. At low energies no parent ion is energetic enough to dissociate, and the parent ion corresponds to 100% of the ion signal. As the photon energy is increased, a certain fraction of the parent ions (in fact according to the cumulative distribution function of the neutral internal energy distribution) still has too little energy to dissociate, but some do. The parent ion fractional abundances decrease, and the daughter ion signal increases. At the dissociative photoionization threshold, E0, all parent ions, even the ones with initially 0 internal energy, can dissociate, and the daughter ion abundance reaches 100% in the breakdown diagram. If the potential energy well of the parent ion is shallow and the complete initial thermal energy distribution is broader than the depth of the well, the breakdown diagram can also be used to determine adiabatic ionization energies.  Data analysis  The data analysis becomes more demanding if there are competing parallel dissociation channels or if the dissociation at threshold is too slow to be observed on the time scale (several Œºs) of the experiment. In the first case, the slower dissociation channel will appear only at higher energies, an effect called competitive shift, whereas in the second, the resulting kinetic shift means that the fragmentation will only be observed at some excess energy, i.e. only when it is fast enough to take place on the experimental time scale. When several dissociation steps follow sequentially, the second step typically occurs at high excess energies: the system has much more internal energy than needed for breaking the weakest bond in the parent ion. Some of this excess energy is retained as internal energy of the fragment ion, some may be converted into the internal energy of the leaving neutral fragment (invisible to mass spectrometry) and the rest is released as kinetic energy, in that the fragments fly apart at some non-zero velocity. More often than not, dissociative photoionization processes can be described within a statistical framework, similarly to the approach used in collision-induced dissociation experiments. If the ergodic hypothesis holds, the system will explore each region of the phase space with a probability according to its volume. A transition state (TS) can then be defined in the phase space, which connects the dissociating ion with the dissociation products, and the dissociation rates for the slow or competing dissociations can be expressed in terms of the TS phase space volume vs. the total phase space volume. The total phase space volume is calculated in a microcanonical ensemble using the known energy and the density of states of the dissociating ion. There are several approaches how to define the transition state, the most widely used being RRKM theory. The unimolecular dissociation rate curve as a function of energy, k(E), vanishes below the dissociative photoionization energy, E0. Statistical theory can also be used in the microcanonical formalism to describe the excess energy partitioning in sequential dissociation steps, as proposed by Klots for a canonical ensemble. Such a statistical approach was used for more than a hundred systems to determine accurate dissociative photoionization onsets, and derive thermochemical information from them.  Thermochemical applications  Dissociative photoionization processes can be generalized as: : If the enthalpies of formation of two of the three species are known, the third can be calculated with the help of the dissociative photoionization energy, E0, using Hess's law. This approach was used, for instance, to determine the enthalpy of formation of the methyl ion, , which in turn was used to obtain the enthalpy of formation of iodomethane, as 15.23 kJ mol‚àí1, with an uncertainty of only 0.3 kJ mol‚àí1. If different sample molecules produce shared fragment ions, a complete thermochemical chain can be constructed, as was shown for some methyl trihalides, where the uncertainty in e.g. the , (Halon-1021) heat of formation was reduced from 20 to 2 kJ mol‚àí1. Furthermore, dissociative photoionization energies can be combined with calculated isodesmic reaction energies to build thermochemical networks. Such an approach was used to revise primary alkylamine enthalpies of formation.

He turned himself in to the police in 1973 after throwing a hand grenade into a bus transporting Catholic workmen in East Belfast, Northern Ireland, which killed one man. He admitted to this killing and those of three other Catholics the previous year, as well as 11 armed robberies. He was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for the four murders. Baker claimed he was a British intelligence agent and member of the Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF). He gave evidence against his former UDA associates, including Ned McCreery, in the murder trial of the \\"romper room\\" torture and killing of James McCartan on 3 October 1972. This made him Northern Ireland's first loyalist supergrass. Although McCreery had assisted in the torture of McCartan, Baker had actually carried out the shooting. Baker's testimony, however, proved inconsistent and was given with the aim of minimising his own role in the killing, so the judge dropped the charges against McCreery and the others. McCreery was also involved in the grenade attack. Baker contacted the Stevens Inquiry team in 1989 and alleged that the security forces assisted in the majority of loyalist paramilitary attacks in the 1970s by providing the UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) with the necessary intelligence to facilitate them. He confirmed that loyalist paramilitaries had perpetrated the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings and stated that \\"half the assassinations in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s would not have been committed without RUC backing\\".\\"Family push for inquiry into loyalist collusion\\".

British Army Albert Wallace Baker, known as \\"Ginger\\" after the drummer in the British rock group Cream, was born into a Protestant family in East Belfast, Northern Ireland. In 1970, at the age of 19, he joined the 2nd Battalion of the British Army's Royal Irish Rangers (R Irish) regiment.Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin Bombings of 1972 and 1973, November 2004. p.79 (The Barron Report 2004) Retrieved 19 January 2012 He trained with the US Special Forces and was a member of the Special Air Service's (SAS) 22nd Battalion. He served briefly in Oman, where he was involved in suppressing the Dhofar Rebellion.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p.71 Baker deserted in July 1972 and returned to Belfast.McKittrick, David (1999). Lost Lives. UK: Mainstream Publications. p.249 He had acquired an English accent during his time in the British Army.Dillon, Martin (1991). The Dirty War. Random House. p.256 Ulster Defence Association Upon his return to Belfast, Baker joined the UDA, which was the largest loyalist paramilitary organisation in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He joined the organisation long before it was proscribed in 1992. Baker was accepted into the movement and quickly became prominent as he possessed his own military firearm and had the ability to train other young members.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p.72 According to journalist Martin Dillon, Baker \\"strutted around the streets of his native east Belfast with a swagger and assuredness lacking in other paramilitary men who did not have an army training\\". As a leading member of the UDA, Baker participated in a total of 11 armed robberies and four sectarian killings; the first robbery taking place just a month after his return. Along with three other UDA accomplices, he held up the Vulcan Bar on the Newtownards Road, brandishing a .45 pistol and stealing the sum of ¬£821 which Baker regarded as \\"pocket money\\". He quickly acquired a reputation for brutality.Wood, p.106 Rated highly by the local UDA leader Tommy Herron, he served as Herron's personal bodyguard for a time.Dillon, The Trigger Men p. 73 He also acted as bodyguard for members of the UDA's ruling body, the Inner Council. Whenever it held meetings, usually inside an East Belfast hotel, Baker would patrol the premises carrying a firearm. Killings He was the ringleader of a UDA unit in his native east Belfast known as the \\"Romper Room Gang\\" which included Ned McCreery, who held the rank of Colonel within the UDA.Houses of the Ooreachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin Bombings of 1972 and 1973, November 2004. p.80. (The Barron Report 2004).Retrieved 19 January 2012 This unit was described by journalist Maeve Connolly as having been as \\"repugnant as the Shankill Butchers\\". On 18 August 1972, the unit carried out the first of four sectarian killings. Baker shot 21-year-old barman Philip Fay five times in the head on the doorstep of his home in Island Street. Fay, who was a native of County Cavan and who had a limited understanding of the sectarian divide in Belfast, answered the door to Baker and confirmed his religion when asked if he was a Catholic. Baker then opened fire.McDonald & Cusack, p. 41 Fay had worked at the Girton Lodge Hotel, one of the locations used for UDA Inner Council meetings and as part of his job he had served drinks to the UDA leaders whilst they met. Herron had ordered Fay's killing when he found out he was a Catholic, fearing that he might have heard sensitive information at the meetings, although in fact Fay had no links whatsoever to republicans.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 74 This was followed a month later by the killing of another Catholic barman, Paul McCartan (52), who was abducted by the unit and brought to a UDA \\"romper room\\" for a \\"rompering\\". These notorious UDA \\"romper rooms\\" had been invented by UDA brigadier Davy Payne in the early 1970s. They were located inside disused buildings, lock-up garages or rooms above pubs and drinking clubs. Once inside, a victim would be \\"rompered\\" (brutally beaten and tortured), and then killed.Nelson, Sarah (1984). Ulster's Uncertain Defenders: Protestant Political, Paramilitary, and Community Groups and the Northern Ireland Conflict. Belfast: Appletree Press. pp.126, 146 After other members of the unit savagely beat McCartan, Baker then shot him to death. According to a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) report, members of a foot patrol had stopped a drunk McCartan as he walked along the Newtownards Road shortly before his abduction but had let him pass after he refused a lift home. However, Baker would later claim that the police had picked him up and had left him off just fifty yards away from where they knew the UDA gang was waiting.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 75 In early October, James McCartan, a 21-year-old forklift driver from The Markets (no relation to Paul), was abducted from the lobby of the Park Avenue Hotel on the Holywood Road after a party. McCartan's friend John Jamison, a Protestant, had attempted to get him away from the gang but he was beaten as was McCartan's girlfriend and as Baker bundled him into the vehicle he yelled at Jamison \\"he's a Fenian bastard\\".Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 77 He was brought to several UDA \\"romper rooms\\" located in UDA clubs in the Newtownards Road area - specifically in Finmore Street and Clermont Lane. McCartan was then stripped naked, hung up by the ankles and subjected to lengthy torture sessions at each club which included being beaten with a pickaxe handle, stabbed 200 times, and his head dropped down onto the concrete floor. The romperings were allegedly presided over by McCreery, and when they had concluded, McCartan was hooded, bundled in a car and taken to waste ground beside the Connswater River off Mersey Street where Baker shot him three times, killing him.McDonald & Cusack, p.56 Tim Pat Coogan alleged that Baker was an active participant in the brutal torture.Coogan, Tim Pat (1995). The Troubles: Ireland's ordeal 1966-1995 and the Search for Peace. New York: Palgrave. p.338 According to testimony at the subsequent trial, the UDA drinking club in Clermont Lane opened during the rompering with several UDA members and their girlfriends arriving to drink and watch. McCartan's body, which was unrecognisable, was found on 3 October on the waste ground where he had been killed. Baker would later claim that McCartan was a wanted republican although, again, he had no paramilitary connections.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 78 On 1 February 1973, Baker and McCreery mounted an attack on a bus which was transporting Catholic workmen in Kingsway Park, Dundonald, East Belfast. After Baker got the bus to slow down when he affected a limp crossing the street, he lobbed a hand grenade inside the vehicle, mortally wounding Patrick Eugene Heenan (47), a married man from Andersonstown with five children. Heenan had been a foreman on the construction site of a Catholic school in East Belfast. He died after receiving a fatal gash to an artery in his leg. Several of his co-workers on the bus gave statements to the RUC. Prison and collusion claims During the spring of 1973, a series of street battles between members of the UDA and the British Army occurred in east Belfast. Herron had expected Baker to assume a leading role in these conflicts but the former soldier maintained a conspicuously low profile, a fact which led some of his fellow UDA members to hint that Baker might be an informer.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 79 Not long after this (again, the exact date is unknown) Baker became \\"sickened and disgusted\\" by the UDA's activities and returned to his former regiment in England. Upon his return, he was court-martialled and discharged; then on 31 May 1973 he turned up at Warminster police station where he told police that he wished to confess his role in the UDA.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 80 He told Sergeant Anthony Godley that he had been involved in four murders and 11 robberies and wished to make a statement to that effect, although he cautioned initially that he would not reveal the names of any of his accomplices and was only interested in his own role in the attacks. He was subsequently questioned in Salisbury and Belfast before being charged and remanded in custody at Crumlin Road gaol.Dillon, The Trigger Men, pp. 80-81 Baker was the first person to be tried in a non-jury Diplock Court. He pleaded guilty to four murders and on 15 October 1973 was sentenced to twenty five years imprisonment, with his sentence to be served outside Northern Ireland. In the course of the trial it emerged that Baker had joined the UDA for the money that was available in UDA circles. In the James McCartan murder trial held in February 1974, Baker agreed to testify against McCreery and six other UDA members, making him Northern Ireland's first loyalist supergrass. He claimed the RUC had offered him Special Category Status in exchange for his testimony. However, the evidence Baker provided was tailored with the aim of minimising his own role in the killing, and therefore was inconsistent and often incoherent. He had claimed that McCreery and the six other accused men had tortured McCartan inside the club and one of them had then ordered Baker to shoot him dead.Murray, Raymond (1990). The SAS in Ireland. Ireland: Mercier Press. p.101 The trial judge, Sir Robert Lowry deemed Baker's evidence as \\"manifestly unreliable\\",Bruce, Steve (1992). The Red Hand: Protestant Paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. UK: Oxford University Press. p.210 and as a result, the judge dropped charges against McCreery and the other six men. Baker spent ten years of his sentence in solitary confinement. In the late 1980s he was on the same cell block as the Birmingham Six.Holroyd & Burbridge, p. 87 Whilst in prison, Baker began a letter writing campaign to the press making a series of allegations about collusion between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries. He alleged that, far from being a deserter, his UDA activity had actually been sanctioned by the British Army and he added that the deputy commander of his UDA unit was also a member of the RUC. He was questioned by detectives regarding his allegations, although no further action was taken.McDonald & Cusack, p. 131 Father Denis Faul, one of those Baker had written to, visited Baker in Frankland Prison to hear the details of his claims to having been a British Intelligence agent involved in collusion, as did the Daily Mirror journalist Paul Foot.Dillon, The Trigger Men, p. 82 He was also alleged to have worked for the Military Reconnaissance Force (MRF).Nugent, Brian (2008). Orwellian Ireland. p.118 According to Baker, his MRF handler was an officer in the Parachute Regiment and that during his time in the UDA, Baker lived at the officer's home in Holywood, outside Belfast.Holroyd & Burbirdge, p. 86 He also claimed that one of the RUC men who escorted him out of the court after he was given his twenty-five year sentence had been one of the same policemen who had previously supplied him with guns. Ken Livingstone, at the time a Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), conducted some of the most in-depth published interviews with Baker in July 1988. Amongst the claims Baker made in these interviews was that RUC officers had given weapons directly to Baker and members of his gang and that he regularly visited Mountpottinger RUC station in the Short Strand to collect guns. He also alleged that the group had planned to attack the Red Lion bar near the Albert Clock, where their target was to be a leading republican but that a police Land Rover had chanced by. The hit was abandoned but the guns were given to a police detective who was waiting in a civilian car in a nearby carpark. From here, Baker claimed, the detective drove the weapons back to East Belfast where he returned them to Baker and his men.Dillon, The Trigger Men, pp. 82-83 Baker stated that \\"half the assassinations in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s would not have been committed without RUC backing\\". An edited transcript of Livingstone's meeting with Baker was published in his book Livingstone's Labours. In 1989, Baker contacted the John Stevens Inquiry team with his allegations. He claimed that the 1972 and 1973 Dublin bombings were carried out by the UDA, and that one of the bombers was a member of the UDA's Inner Council.Houses of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin Bombings of 1972 and 1973, November 2004. pp.81-82 (The Barron Report 2004). Retrieved 19 January 2012 His brother told journalist Frank Doherty of the Sunday World that Baker had delivered the explosives used in the 1 December 1972 Eden Quay and Sackville Place bombings from Eglington, County Londonderry to a unit of the Belfast UDA, which had then driven the cars down to Dublin. Two men were killed and 131 people injured in these two city centre explosions. Journalist Joe Tiernan contradicted Baker's claims, however, and instead alleged that the attacks were executed by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).\\"Dublin and Monaghan bombings: Cover-up and incompetence\\". Politico. Joe Tiernan. 3 May 2007. p.1 Retrieved 19 January 2012 According to Baker's brother, Baker had taken part in another cross-border bombing in Donegal. Baker also confirmed that the May 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, which killed 33 civilians, were perpetrated by loyalist paramilitaries. Two units from the UVF's Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades had in fact carried out the three Dublin carbombings whilst another unit from the Mid-Ulster Brigade executed the Monaghan attack. The UVF Mid- Ulster Brigade was commanded at the time by Billy Hanna, a sergeant in the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) who also allegedly organised the four attacks and had links to British intelligence.Houses of the Oireachtas Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights Interim Report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings (The Barron Report) December 2003. pp.145-146, 239-240 Retrieved 16 January 2012 On 15 July 1993, the UVF released a statement in which it admitted to having carried out the 1974 bombings.CAIN: UVF: Statement by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), 15 July 1993. Retrieved 16 January 2012 According to the Irish News, the Irish Government had requested the British Government for permission to speak with Baker in prison about the attacks, for which nobody has ever been charged. At the time the carbombings took place on 17 May 1974, Baker was already serving his prison sentence. After serving 18 years of his sentence, Baker was released from prison in 1992.McDonald & Cusack, p. 42 That same year, his former associate Ned McCreery was shot dead by the UDA for being an alleged infomer. Since his release from prison, Baker has made no further allegations against the Northern Ireland security forces. Bibliography *Dillon, Martin (1991). The Dirty War.

The consulate reports to the ambassador at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. The current Consul General is Judith Ravin, incumbent since September 2020. She was preceded by Robert G. Burgess. Ranked one of America's biggest adjudication posts in the world, the Chennai Consulate also ranks first globally in processing employment-based visas, ranks among the top globally in issuing 'L' and 'H' category visas, and ranks eighth globally in terms of all category of visas being issued. As of 2009, about 20,000 visitors enter the consulate every month to obtain a range of services, including the American Library and cultural and educational programs conducted by the Consulate General. Location The Consulate General building is located at 220 Anna Salai, and abuts the Oxford University Press building. The building stands at the intersection of Anna Salai and Cathedral Road on the Gemini Circle facing the Anna Flyover on a land leased for long-term from St. George's Cathedral and has entrance on both roads. Both the Consulate General and the American Library Center are located in the same building. History Trading links between the United States and the East India Company's territories began when the American ship Chesapeake sailed up the Hooghly to anchor in Calcutta in 1786, just ten years after the United States Declaration of Independence. On 19 November 1792, the then American President George Washington appointed Benjamin Joy, a businessman from Newburyport, Massachusetts, as the first American Consul to India. With the advice of the then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and consent of the Senate, President Washington commissioned Joy to that office on 21 November 1792. When Joy reached Calcutta in April 1794, the colonial government repudiated his commission. However, he was permitted to 'reside here as a Commercial Agent subject to the Civil and Criminal Jurisdiction of this Country ... ', and he stayed in Calcutta and served as the commercial agent of the American government. Dare House at Parry's Corner, where the Consulate General was located from 1940 till the 1950s To manage U.S. maritime interests in South India, Joy appointed William Abbott, a British-born American merchant, as the first American consular agent of the Madras Presidency on 24 November 1794, who served for more than a decade. Abbott was actively engaged in politics and even served as the mayor of Madras for a brief period in 1797. The trade between the United States and the city involved cotton, tea, spices, and leather from South India and \\"blocks of ice hewn from the frozen lakes of Massachusetts.\\" The Indo-American trade experienced a hiatus for several decades that followed, and, when it revived, a separate U.S. consular agency was established in Madras on 24 May 1867 with Joseph L. Thompson, of Massachusetts, serving as the consular agent to Madras. He served till October 1872. The consular agents in Madras were expected to report directly to the State Department of the U.S. government. The post continued as a consular agency under the Consulate General at Calcutta until 1908. The main role of the consular agents during those times was to promote trade and business interests of the United States, and most consular agents between 1867 until 1908 were selected from the ranks of expatriate businessmen. The Reorganization Act of 5 April 1906 regularized consular service with fixed tenures of office, fixed salaries, a system of promotion, and seven position classes including consuls general and consuls. This changed the prevailing trend, and in June 1908, the post of consular agency was raised to the rank of a consulate. In December 1908, with the recommendation by the U.S. Department of State, Nathaniel B. Stewart was appointed as the first representative of the American government with the title of Consul in Madras, who served the next two years. An office was established with the official status as a consulate on the third floor of a building owned by Parrys and Company, located on No. 1 China Bazaar Road, now known as Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Road, at Parry's Corner. Later, the office moved to a building between Rajaji Salai and Moore Street. When the building was demolished and built as a modern six-storied building, now known as Dare House, the U.S. Consulate continued its tenancy by occupying the fourth floor of the building in October 1940. With India gaining independence, the American diplomatic post in Madras was officially raised to a Consulate General on 15 August 1947, marking a milestone in the bilateral relationship between the two countries. On the same day, Roy E. B. Bower became the last consul and the first consul general in Madras in independent India. With Parry's Company wanting the whole building in 1952, the Consulate had to look for new premises. Five years later, in the 1950s, the Consulate General moved to a building on Mount Road (the present- day Anna Salai), currently occupied by the Bank of America. With the expansion of the Indo-U.S. relations after Independence, the Consulate General required a purpose-built structure to accommodate a diversity of activities such as library services, cultural programming, educational exchange, visas, American citizen services and development assistance, along with the ancient standby, trade promotion. For this purpose, the Consulate General leased out a parcel of land on the Gemini Circle from the Church of South India to build its own building. On 3 January 1969, the Consulate General moved to its present location at the Gemini Circle, which was inaugurated by Ambassador Chester Bowles. Architecture The Chennai Consulate General Building in 1969 The American consulate building was designed by Burk, Lebreton and Lamantia of New Orleans, combining the American architecture of the 1960s and features of traditional South Indian architecture. The architecture of the consulate building was inspired from the traditional houses of Thanjavur and Karaikudi. The American architect hired to design the building traveled around South India in search of inspiration before zeroing in on the final theme. As quoted by S. Krishnan, who accompanied Lamantia on his architectural quest in Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Lamantia, whose roots were in Don Quixote's village, chose the architecture of the traditional houses of Thanjavur and Chettinad to blend with the American style in his design plan. Thus, the rectangular Consulate General building was built around a roofless central courtyard, with verandahs running around it and rooms opening out of them. In addition, inspired by the South Indian temple architecture, the four exterior walls were studded with chips of Pallavaram granite. The building has a library space in the second floor. It also has a large auditorium. A new office building of the Consulate General was planned in 2008 to be built in about five years. It still has not been built, but plans still remain. Consular District The Chennai consular district, covering three states and three union territories of the country, serves a population of about 160 million and includes seven official languages used daily in the post's visa operations. An increasing middle-class population in the region who intend to travel abroad, increase in demand for skilled workforce in the United States, and the transformation of the Indo‚ÄìU.S. relationship led to an increase in visa demand in the Chennai consular district in recent years. The demand for non-immigrant visas in Chennai increased by more than 80 percent between 2004 and 2007, peaking at around 280,000 in 2007. In response, the post added staff and interview windows and improved its training, fraud prevention, and workload management, making the wait times for non-immigrant visas stable at less than a week. Owing to the drastic increase in visa demand from the Chennai district in the recent years, the embassy at New Delhi designated all of India as one consular district. This enabled people seeking visa appointments in New Delhi and Calcutta even if they traditionally live in the Chennai consular district. Functions The Chennai Consulate serves the Chennai consular district, which includes the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and the union territories of Lakshadweep, Puducherry, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Consulate processes applications for both immigrant and non-immigrant visas to the United States. The Consulate provides U.S. citizens with assistance and support in aspects such as passport replacement, CRBA, notarials, registration in embassy ward system, renewal of passport, and so forth. The consulate reports through the Embassy of the United States in New Delhi. The country-level coordination office for Fraud Prevention Programme is located in the Chennai consulate. The Chennai Consulate General has a virtual consulate at Bangalore, which does not process visa applications. The consular section at the Chennai Consulate has been expanded eight times since 1988 and was designed to process 2,500 visa applications annually. In 2004‚Äì2005, the Chennai Consulate General processed approximately 8,600 immigrant visa cases, issuing 5,300. The consulate no longer processes immigrant visas. From 1 December 2011, the Chennai Consulate General became the only center in the country to receive and process blanket L category visas meant for managers, executives, or specialized knowledge professionals transferring within their company. From 1 January 2012, the center stopped processing immigrant visa petitions. The Chennai Consulate is one of America's biggest adjudication posts in the world and the number one globally in processing employment-based visas. It is ranked among the top globally in issuing 'L' and 'H' category visas for workers and professionals and is ranked eighth globally in terms of all category of visas being issued, along with the ones in Mumbai and New Delhi coming within the top 10 globally in the volume of visas. The number of visa applications processed at the Consulate increased threefold between 1998 and 2008. In 1998, almost 79,000 people applied for visas at the Consulate, which increased to 237,306 applications in 2007. The Chennai Consulate issued 142,565 non-immigrant visas in 2010 ‚Äî the most among Mission India's five consular sections, up from 7,500 non-immigrant visa applications in 1992. The Consulate conducts an average of 1,200 to 1,400 interviews every day, which has gone up to 1,800 in a day, with an average refusal rate of 20 percent. In 2017, the Consulate General adjudicated more than 305,000 visa applications. With more than 300 employees, the Chennai Consulate processes 900 applications a day of which around 500 to 600 are 'B1' and 'B2' visas for temporary stay in the United States. Over 20,000 people visit the Chennai Consulate every month to obtain services ranging from visits to the American Library to visa services. Till 2005, the fraud prevention unit (FPU) of the Chennai Consulate General was home base for the India country coordinator for consular fraud-prevention programs, a position later transferred to the embassy in New Delhi. The Chennai Consulate General's quarterly India Fraud Bulletin has been reviewed by the Department of State. The community liaison office at the Chennai Consulate General publishes a newsletter Chennai Masala. Staff As of 2005, there were 20 foreign service officers in the Chennai Consulate General, up from five officers in 1999. Despite this increase in staff, the Chennai Consulate General cannot cope with the NIV demand due to heavy workload. List of Consul Generals * 1. Roy E. B. Bower (1947‚Äì) * 20. Richard D.

Later, the library along with the United States Information Service (USIS) moved to the Vummudiar building at 162 Mount Road, with a small reading room with attached library. In 1951, the library was again shifted to the Addison Building on Mount Road. Libraries in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Trivandrum and Guntur were organized under USIS Madras in the 1950s, and after the closure of all the regional libraries in 1969, the Chennai American Library started serving patrons throughout South India. Since 1969, the current American Consulate General building became the permanent home for the library. Ambassador Chester Bowles, who formally opened the new building, called it the 'highest point in the deep friendship and close relations between India and the U.S.' In 2000s, the library began taking materials to people by organizing road shows and traveling exhibitions in several South Indian cities. In September 2004, the Chennai American Library established an American Corner in Bangalore in partnership with the Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan. In January 2008, the library participated in the annual Chennai Book Fair. Of the 700,000 visitors who attended the book fair, over 8,000 people visited the American Library stall and 438 signed up for new library memberships. Presently, the library has a collection of over 14,000 books, 140 journals, U.S. Government publications, reports, newspapers and others, in addition to access to more than 10,000 full-texts of journals and 30,000 other electronic documents. The collection is particularly strong in the areas of American studies, American literature, management, law, international relations, environmental studies, and English as a second language. The collection can be accessed through the computerized Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), which contains the complete holdings of all the four American Libraries in India in Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and New Delhi, available on the World Wide Web. The library functions from 9:30 am to 5:00 pm on all days except Sundays. The library also has an office of the U.S.‚ÄìIndia Educational Foundation functioning on second and fourth Saturdays of the month. Since 11 April 2009, the library is open to public on Saturdays, after nearly a decade. On 31 May 2012, Consul General Jennifer McIntyre launched a new, bi-monthly e-newsletter at the American Library, which aimed to provide updates on new books, articles, and documentaries, as well as list additions to the library's electronic collection of books and articles. Events The American Center and the American Library together host several cultural events. The library also hosts Saturday Matinee, a popular event on Saturday mornings in which American movies are shown for the public and members of library inside the center. Programs U.S. Secretary Hillary Clinton delivers remarks to staff and family members of the Chennai Consulate General during her visit in 2011 In 2001, the Global AIDS Program (GAP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, opened its office in Chennai to prevent the HIV epidemic in India in partnership with National AIDS Control Program. Incidents In January 1998, a small bomb was detonated under the Gemini Flyover near the Consulate building. In 2011, U.S. Vice-Consul Maureen Chao was criticised for her controversial remark on the complexion of the local people. On 14 September 2012, the Consulate was attacked by a group of protesters, when a protest by Islamic organisations against controversial American film Innocence of Muslims turned violent, following which the Consulate shut down its visa section for two days on 17 and 18 September. In November 2014, a terror plot allegedly by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to execute terror strikes in the Chennai Consulate General was foiled by the Indian authorities. The plot was code named \\"wedding hall\\" which was to be executed by two terrorists called \\"cooks\\" who were to gain entry into India from Maldives. The bomb devices that were to be planted at the Consulate General were code named \\"Spice\\". In December 2015, floods covered the city, including the consulate, which reportedly had up to 4 feet of water in the lower floors. Pictures on the walls of the consulate depict this event.

He was born in Nairn, Scotland in 1882, emigrating to New Zealand in 1914. For 34 years he ran Rawene Hospital, campaigned for state funding of health and created a health service for the Hokianga area.  Early life  View of Rawene township in 1918 George McCall Smith was born in Nairn, Scotland on 13 November 1882. He completed his medical degree at the University of Edinburgh, and then went into general practice in Strathmiglo, Fife and Perth. In 1907 he married Barbara Grieve with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He emigrated to Rawene in New Zealand in 1914 with one of his patients, Lucy Scott.  Career  Smith and Lucy Scott arrived in Rawene in September 1914. It was a remote community in the Hokianga, the population was impoverished and 60% MƒÅori. Smith was appointed Surgeon Superintendent at Rawene Hospital for which he was paid ¬£300 a year. He trained Lucy to be his anaesthetist. Some years later Lucy's qualifications and ability to be an anaesthetist were questioned but the local Hospital Board considered that she was qualified by her experience. In 1921 the Hokianga County Council, which ran the Hospital Board, introduced cost-cutting measures which included terminating Smith and Lucy's employment and readvertising Smith's job at ¬£100 a year. The Council's decision may have been related to some Council members finding Smith troublesome or his personal affairs. Smith's divorce was widely reported in British and New Zealand newspapers. Some of the community were shocked by the fact that Smith and Lucy were unmarried when they arrived in Rawene, though they were subsequently married. The community rallied in support of Smith, presenting a 750 signature petition to the Board, and he was reappointed at his original salary.  Rawene Hospital and Hokianga Special Area  The Health Department required all hospitals to have special isolation beds for infectious diseases cases, in particular tuberculosis (TB). Smith raised money from the community and in 1915 he closed in the hospital verandah and increased the number of hospital beds, even though he had no intention of treating infectious diseases patients in his hospital. By the following year it was clear that the hospital resources were inadequate and in 1920, although some facilities had been improved, he began lobbying for a better water supply. After the divorce matter and local body elections Smith set about planning a new hospital. In 1925 the Health Department approved the plans for a new hospital and Smith raised money from the community to furnish and equip it. To raise funds he implemented an unofficial 'hut tax' over every dwelling in the county, ran an illegal casino in Rawene and an illegal raffle. The new hospital was built on time and within budget and was opened by the Minister of Health in March 1928. In the 1930s Smith was advocating for state funded medical care. The election of the Labour government in 1935 with its policy of a state medical service was an opportunity for Smith to promote his views. He saw that doctors had financial objectives, many patients were unable to pay for treatment and that a solution was for all doctors to be on salaries. He outlined his views in his first book Notes from a backblock hospital in 1938. In 1939 Smith lobbied the government for the Hokianga to be given a special area status. Under this scheme all doctors, in the hospital and community, would be paid salaries by the Hospital Board. Consultations, pharmaceuticals, investigations and hospital admissions would be free. Hospital and domiciliary services would be combined, nurses would be employed by the Health Department, and clinics established in the various districts. After delays, partly due to the war, opposition from the medical profession and protracted negotiations with the government, the Hokianga Special Area was set up in September 1941.  Medical practice  In the early 1930s Smith began to practice twilight sleep for women in childbirth using Nembutal and hyoscine (Scopolamine). A government Commission of Inquiry into Maternity Services in 1937 included an investigation of anaesthetic practices. The Commission examined Smith's practice, noting Smith had made a special study of painless childbirth, and found his results could not be bettered. The Commission recorded 108 maternity cases at Rawene in the year (including 36 MƒÅori), but only seven maternity beds. Most MƒÅori women gave birth at home and the hospital was unable to cater for more women wanting to give birth there. The Commission recommended an increase in maternity beds, staff and equipment to cater for more MƒÅori cases. In 1948 a newspaper reported that women were flocking to Rawene Hospital to give birth because it offered painless childbirth. Smith practised some unconventional cures: using cod liver oil and vaseline on dressings to give a non-stick covering, wrapping simple fractures in newspaper casts which could be easily removed, inventing a 'black box' which was placed over the head of anaesthetised patients to raise , refuting the need to eat green vegetables, rejection of circumcision, and encouraging schools to serve sheep-head broth to the children. During World War 2, with the threat of a Japanese invasion, Smith stockpiled medical supplies, seriously depleting the nation's supplies. During the 1918 flu epidemic Smith ordered the police to prevent visitors from entering the area, in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease. In 1933 an epidemic of a febrile illness broke out in Rawene and Smith ordered all shops and schools to be closed, assisted by the police. The Medical Officer of Health for Northland was unwilling to set in place similar restrictions in nearby Kaikohe. However, in order to prevent the spread of the disease Smith succeeded in stopping a visit of the spiritual leader Ratana and his followers. Smith's management of TB cases was called into question in 1946 when patients died in their own homes, putting other family members at risk. Smith always maintained that treating TB cases in sanatoria was ineffective and that the incidence of TB would be reduced by improving living standards, particularly diet and housing, and using effective drug treatment. In 1948 during the polio epidemic Smith demanded that the Northland Medical Officer of Health, James Newman, use his authority to close schools and shops to prevent the disease from spreading. Newman refused on the grounds that widespread closure of schools was not effective in dealing with the epidemic, and school teachers and shopkeepers also refused to take orders from Smith. In 1948 following a committee of inquiry into the death of a child in his care, Smith and Lucy resigned even though the committee's report cleared Smith of wrongdoing. They moved to Waikanae, near their daughter Janet, where Smith set up in private practice.  Other activities  Smith and Lucy purchased land for a farm near Horeke in 1920. He organised, and was chair of, a local branch of the Farmer's Union. The farming venture was unsuccessful and the land was later leased and then sold to the government. He recognised the need for local people to have an income and promoted growing tobacco as a cash crop, however the scheme was a failure. Smith was a convert to Social Credit policies and began a Hokianga party branch, later becoming president of New Zealand Social Credit. He advocated for a special currency as a solution to unemployment.  Personal life  Alexander McCall Smith, George McCall Smith's grandson, 2018 Smith and Lucy had two children, Jock and Janet. Jock died in 1932. Janet completed five years at Otago Medical School in Dunedin but left to get married, much to her father's displeasure. He did not attend her wedding to Peter Irwin, an Air Force officer, and she was given away by Sir Douglas Robb. She later completed her medical degree in 1963 and practised in New Zealand and Australia in the area of child, student and women's health. She was a health and social activist and died in 2009. The writer Alexander McCall Smith, Smith's grandson, visited Rawene Hospital in 2014.  Legacy  George McCall Smith \\"began ahead of his time yet ended up overtaken by new developments. Eventually he paid the price of professional isolation. His single-mindedness gave him the strength to succeed, yet in the end ironically, it contributed to his eventual loss of self-confidence and consequent resignation\\". Smith was not only a doctor but also a campaigner. He promoted the need for adequate income, diet and housing, and campaigned for a health service which was free at the point of need. He was responsible for creating a co-operative medical service and the Hokianga Special Area integrating medical and nursing services as well as hospital and community services, laying the foundation for the health service in the Hokianga.

He was an All Black captain, and despite only playing nine matches (including four tests) is recognised as a great. His 26 appearances for the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force rugby team (known as the Kiwis), which toured the UK in 1946‚Äì47, earned him high praise. He also played for the New Zealand MƒÅori, being of NgƒÅpuhi descent. All Black career Smith only played nine matches for the All Blacks, including four tests. His entire All Black career consists of series in or against Australia in 1946, 1947, and 1949. There were no All Black tests in 1948, and the only other opponent New Zealand faced during Smith's time in the All Blacks was South Africa, in a series from which MƒÅori players were excluded. 1946 Australia tour of New Zealand Smith played the Australians twice during this tour‚Äîfirst as captain of a victorious North Auckland side (32‚Äì19), then as a member of the first All Black side since 1938. At Carisbrook in Dunedin, Smith scored a try in a 31‚Äì8 test victory. He did not play in the second test two weeks later. 1947 New Zealand tour of Australia This nine-match tour was Smith's only trip away with the All Blacks. He made another single test appearance in a two-match test series. 1949 Australia tour of New Zealand The All Blacks toured apartheid South Africa in 1949 but Smith, being MƒÅori, was excluded from the squad. His official All Black profile now attributes his non-selection to \\"the unforgivable weakness shown by New Zealand rugby in meeting South Africa's apartheid conditions\\". While that team was away, Australia toured New Zealand, leading to the unusual situation of simultaneous All Black series in different countries. \\"The New Zealand Rugby Union ... decided that the 1949 matches against Australia would have full test status, even though the country's top 30 players were in South Africa. One of the reasons for the decision was to not deprive test caps to three of the All Blacks, Johnny Smith, Ben Couch and Vince Bevan who were not considered for the South African tour because they were Maori. All three would surely have otherwise gone to South Africa.\\" Smith captained the All Black sides that faced Australia. Both tests were lost (including one on 3 September‚Äîthe same day that the Springboks beat New Zealand in Durban). They were the last All Black matches that Smith played. He was selected to play Australia again in 1952, but withdrew through injury. North Auckland Smith played 41 matches for North Auckland, his last in 1954. He captained the province regularly, including against Australia (1946) and the British Lions (1950). Against the Lions he nearly scored a try that would have won the game, but was controversially ruled to have knocked the ball on. He was captain later in 1950 when North Auckland won the Ranfurly Shield for the first time, defeating South Canterbury. In 1956, Smith coached North Auckland, and also served as a selector. Recognition In 1949 Smith was the first recipient of the Tom French Cup, awarded to the MƒÅori player of the year. The official All Blacks profile published for Smith states that \\"there is little argument that Smith rates among the greatest midfield players ever produced in New Zealand\\". Posthumous recognition In 2014, rugby writer Wynne Gray included Smith in his '100 Greatest All Blacks'. Smith was recognised as Northland Legend of Sport at the Northland Sports Awards in 2005. Other sports Smith's wide-ranging sporting ability led to a national junior tennis title in the 1938-39 doubles (with Allan Burns), appearances for the Northland cricket team, and success as an amateur golfer. Personal and family life He was born in Kaikohe, New Zealand in 1922. He attended Kaikohe Primary and then Kaikohe District High School. He was one of three children. His father Leslie was a baker who had served in World War I and played rugby for both South Auckland and North Island Country. His mother, Niria Takiwira, belonged to the Te Uri-o-Hua hap≈´ of NgƒÅpuhi. His brother Peter was also an All Black. In 1946 he married Dorothy Robinson. They had four children, three of whom survived him (along with Dorothy) when he died in 1974. His son Glen won a national swimming title.

A single specimen was found off the Pacific coast of Colombia in 1888; the species has since been found in the Galapagos Islands. It is endemic to this area and has not been recorded elsewhere. Description A typical Luidia superba has five long, tapering arms with pointed tips. The holotype, the first specimen to be observed and described, had six arms, which was unfortunate as that led to the belief for many years that the normal number of limbs was six. As in other members of the genus, the upper surface of the disc and the arms is covered with paxillae, pillar-like spines with truncated ends. On the underside there are multiple rows of tube feet running down each arm.Family Luidiidae Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-01-14.

Luidia superba is probably the largest five-armed starfish in the world. The largest specimen from Tagus Cove in the Galapagos Islands had a radius, measured from the centre of the disc to the tip of the arms, of . Its other dimensions were a disc radius of , a maximum arm width of and a longest spine of . By comparison, a specimen of the ten-armed Luidia magnifica from Hawaii had a radius of and the nine-armed Luidia savignyi at was the largest known starfish at the time at which it was measured. The site at Tagus Cove is species rich because of the upwelling of the nutrient-laden, cool water Equatorial Undercurrent nearby, providing an optimum environment for growth which may encourage gigantism. Distribution and habitat The holotype was collected off the coast of Colombia by researchers in the vessel R. V. Albatross in 1888 at a depth of . This specimen was described by A. H. Clark in 1917 and for a long time was the only known example of the species. Other specimens were later recorded during the Cortez 1, 2 and 3 cruises undertaken to research Asterozoa in these waters in 1982 and 1985. In 1977, following reports of a similar starfish in the Galapagos Islands, several specimens were observed at night on the seabed of Tagus Cove, Isabela Island, at depths of to . During the day, the starfish bury themselves under about of sand, the only clue to their presence being a depression in the sand surface. In that location, these starfish were quite common in 1977, there being about one individual per 10 square metres (yards) of seabed. More recently, the El Nino event of 1982‚Äì3 was particularly severe and afterwards, Luidia superba was no longer to be found in its previous location in Tagus Cove. Its fate in the Galapagos Islands remains unclear. Biology The stomachs of the three specimens taken from Tagus Cove were examined to determine their diet. Unfortunately they were empty except for a few sea urchin spines, but like other members of its genus, Luidia superba is likely to be an opportunistic predator of large benthic fauna and a scavenger. Related species feed mainly on bivalve molluscs, brittle stars and sea urchins.

Development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. The 1923 D-7 monoplane was their first two- seat design and one of the first of its kind, though the Fokker FG-2 two seat biplane glider flew the previous year; the D-7 was named after the wife of an Akaflieg Darmstadt student killed at the first Rh√∂n (Wasserkuppe) glider meeting in 1920. The Margarete was a wood framed aircraft with a high, braced, two spar wing with ply covering from the front spar to the leading edge and fabric covered aft. The wing had a thick and cambered profile inboard of the tips, which had a thinner and more symmetric profile. Initially the wing plan was rectangular, with triangular ailerons mounted on straight hinges which were attached to the front spar at the tips, reaching the trailing edge inboard. Later, the aileron area was reduced, partly by cropping them inboard and also by tapering their trailing edges and rounding their tips. Each wing was braced from the lower fuselage with an asymmetric, V-form, streamlined strut to the two spars at about one-third span. The fuselage was plywood covered with a flat top, deep, slightly curved sides and a V-shaped bottom. The nose was blunt and the open, unscreened cockpit used for solo flying was well forward of the wing leading edge. The separate second cockpit was under the wing, close to the centre of gravity so that its occupation did not seriously affect the trim. The wing centre section was supported above this cockpit on an extension of the upper rear fuselage, which dropped away aft to become slender at the tail. There was a short undercarriage skid attached directly to the fuselage underside, aided by a small tailskid. A narrow, triangular, ply covered fin carried a fabric covered, trapezoidal rudder which extended to the bottom of the fuselage. The fabric covered tailplane was mounted on the top of the fuselage; in plan, tailplane and elevators were straight edged, only slightly tapered and with angled tips. A small elevator cut-out allowed rudder movement. Operational history The D-7 Margarete first flew in 1923 and took part in both the 1923 and 1924 Rh√∂n events, setting an unofficial record at the latter with a passenger-carrying flight of 21 minutes. It was later used for passenger flights, though not for basic training, until it was written off in 1927 when an aileron cable broke during landing.

It grows in alpine and subalpine areas with moist soils and is a part of the Gleichrniaceae family. The species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in 1810.  Description  Gleichenia alpina is a common native ground-fern that grows in boggy alpine and subalpine vegetation. It has the typical Gleichenia foliage, which is repeatedly dichotomously divided before ending in pinnate laminas. The distinctive feature is deep pouches densely covered with hairs on the underside of the pinnules. Gleichenia alpina is characterised by comparatively short frond axes and the dense orange-brown (becoming pale) scales that obscure the abaxial surface of the lamina. Its strongly pouched ultimate segments mean it can be confused only with G. dicarpa. From that species, G. alpina can be distinguished by: the absence of stellate scales with patent branches on the Œ≤ costae; the strongly convex adaxial surface of the ultimate segments; only 0‚Äì1 (rarely 2) pseudodichotomous forks in the pinnae (excluding growth from pinna buds); the absence of accessory leaflets around the rachis bud; and pinna buds that usually extend, often more than once. In contrast, G. dicarpa has: stellate scales with patent branches (curled in Chatham Islands‚Äô plants) on the abaxial and/or adaxial surfaces of the Œ≤ costae; complanate or weakly convex adaxial surface of the ultimate segments; 1‚Äì4 (rarely 0 or 5) pseudodichotomous forks in the pinnae (excluding growth from pinna buds); usually accessory leaflets around the rachis bud; and pinna buds that extend only occasionally and rarely more than once.  Habitat  Gleichenia alpina occurs in subalpine bogs and scrub, and other cold, open habitats. It usually grows in the open, often growing through other vegetation, and rarely extends into forest. It favours wet ground, and is often found with Empodisma.  Distribution  Gleichenia alpina typical form Tasmania: Found throughout Tasmania's alpine areas above 700m, some distributions include the Central Plateau, Walls of Jerusalem, Cradle Valley and Mt Field National Park. New Zealand: North and South Islands. Exact distribution still unclear but plants matching G. alpina are known from the Central Volcanic Plateau, Takaka, and Denniston Plateau, and plants sharing the same haplotype as limited sampling of Tasmanian G. alpina are known from Mt Somers (Perrie et al. 2007). Currently the status of G. alpina in New Zealand requires further study as some reduced forms of G. dicarpa can be easily confused with it.

John Hamilton Cowper Johnson, and thus began a correspondence that lasted until her death. The historian C V Wedgwood wrote the preface to a 1960 edition of the book, in which she reveals that the novel was written partly at the instigation of Macaulay's publisher, John Murray, who had asked for something to shed light on the background to her first novel, Abbots Verney (1906). They Were Defeated is set in the 17th century, and the poets Robert Herrick, Sir John Suckling and John Cleveland are major characters. Other real historical characters who feature prominently are Abraham Cowley, Andrew Marvell and Henry More. Plot The first part of the novel is set in Devon, where Dr Conybeare, a progressive-minded physician, resides in the parish of Rev. Robert Herrick. The widowed doctor lives alone with the youngest of his four children, his fifteen-year-old daughter Julian. Conybeare himself is an atheist, but the studious Julian attends church with her friend Meg Yarde, granddaughter of the local squire. Meg's brother Giles is a student at the University of Cambridge, along with Julian's brother Kit. Dr Conybeare deplores the lack of educational opportunities for women, and has Julian privately tutored in the classics by Herrick, who also instils in her a love for literature, particularly poetry. When an elderly local woman is accused of witchcraft, Conybeare and his daughter hide her in their home, but she is discovered and sentenced to be burned at the stake. The doctor administers a fast-acting poison to save her from suffering, and thus incurs the anger of the local population. Deciding to take Julian away from the hostile atmosphere of the village, Dr Conybeare arranges a visit to his son in Cambridge, and a party is made up, consisting of the Conybeares, Herrick and Meg Yarde. The second part of the novel takes place mainly in Cambridge, where Julian is thrilled to find herself in the company of many prominent poets and philosophers, and begins attending classes given by Henry More to selected young ladies. She is largely unaware of the political upheavals that threaten to escalate into war, but is concerned when her brother Kit converts to Catholicism without their father's knowledge. She also falls in love with Kit's urbane tutor, John Cleveland, even though Cleveland has no sympathy with the idea of female education and belittles Julian's interest in the classics and philosophy. Banned by his college fellowship from marrying, he has no fear of permanent entanglement, but does not seek to draw Julian into a sexual relationship. Their friendship is resented by Giles Yarde, who is himself in love with Julian. After a few weeks, Squire Yarde summons Herrick and Meg back to Devon, but the Conybeares stay on. When the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Dr John Cosin, is threatened with the loss of his position because of his supposed Catholic leanings (early 1641), the authorities begin to crack down on recusants, and three Catholic priests are arrested while giving mass. Several students found attending the service, including Kit, are reported to their colleges. Because of his burgeoning romance with Julian, Cleveland agrees to keep quiet about Kit's involvement, on condition that he abandon his Catholicism. Kit refuses to do so, and goes to London. His father pursues him there, leaving Cleveland to take advantage of his time alone with Julian. Kit is found in the entourage of the prominent Catholic courtier, Sir Kenelm Digby. Conybeare decides to leave Kit to make his own way in the world, and returns to Cambridge. Cleveland, realising that his affair with Julian must now come to an end, breaks off their relationship. Dr Conybeare's elder son, Francis, arrives with news that Kit is back in the country and the doctor goes once more to London in the hope of persuading Kit to return to Cambridge, leaving Julian in the care of Francis. Very soon, Francis hears rumours of Julian's involvement with Cleveland, whom he hates as a result of their previous acquaintance. He confronts Cleveland and a brawl begins. When Julian attempts to intervene, Francis pushes her out of the way and she hits her head on a corner of the table and is killed outright. Her death coincides with the execution of the king's favourite, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, an alumnus of Cleveland's college, to whom she had been in the process of writing an epitaph. In an epilogue, set in 1647, Herrick is about to be turned out of his church to make way for a Puritan incumbent. We learn that Giles and Meg Yarde have both been killed in the war, and that Dr Conybeare is in exile in Holland and Kit in France. John Cleveland has taken Julian's last poem and published it under his own name.

He was until September 2012 the world record holder in the F57 javelin throw. Life and sports Stephens was born in Kenfig Hill in Bridgend, South Wales. At the age of nine an accident on a railway line resulted in the loss of both of his legs. He started swimming for the Dragons Disabled Swimming Club before moving on to other sports. As a youth he joined the Cardiff Huskies ice sledge hockey team, which led to an interest in sport. He began competing in athletic competitions in 2003 at the age of 15, winning the gold in discus, javelin and shot put at the Junior British Championship. He continued his success into the senior field and at the age of 16 he broke the British senior record in all three throwing events. In 2006 he took part in his first Paralympics when he represented the Great Britain ice sledge hockey team at the 2006 Winter Paralympics, having represented the team at both the 2004 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey World Championships and the 2005 IPC Ice Sledge Hockey European Championships. Stephens competed in three events in the 2008 Summer Paralympics, finishing 11th in discus, 8th in shot put and 4th in the javelin. In 2011, Stephens won the gold at the Paralympic Athletics World Championships in New Zealand, recording a lifetime best of 39.11 metres in the javelin. He followed this up by recording a world record, at the Czech Athletics Open in Olomouc, in the men's F57 javelin with a distance of 41.37 metres. In April 2012 he qualified in the javelin for the 2012 Summer Paralympics and was selected by sponsors as an ambassador for the British team. Expectations were high for Stephens going into the games as World champion, but his throwing style was judged illegal and he was red flagged on his first two throws. His final throw was poor and he finished 10th in his event, failing to qualify for the final round. Stephens later complained that in the previous 2011 World Championships his action was deemed legal, and was deeply unhappy at the official's decision. The London games also saw him lose his world record to Brazilian athlete Claudiney Batista dos Santos, who recorded a distance of 45.38 metres. Personal life In 2012 he married Charlene Stephens, using prosthetics to dance with her and walk down the aisle.

Maharaj Prithiwipati, being very old began to consider as to the selection of a successor. He reflected that his eldest son had been taken away by God, and had left no heir. He could not give the gaddi to his second son, Dal Shah, as he was excluded by having only one eye. If he gave it to the third, Udyot Shah, it would appear unjust to put a younger son on the gaddi to the prejudice of an elder claimant. His council was divided in its choice. Some were in favor of the second, and others of the third son, and they could not determine to whom to give gaddi. Chandrarup Shah now presented himself to the Raja at a private audience, and said that all the sons of raja could not succeed their father, and the practice heretofore, observed, should still be followed. Prithwipati hereupon asked him to explain himself, and he then related all the particulars as to the rani of Birbhadra Shah having been pregnant, and having given birth to Nara Bhupal Shah. The Raja was glad to hear this, but was still full of doubt. Chandrarup Shah sent a messenger to fetch Narbhupal Shah, but the Raja of Tanhun, thinking that, by mean of this child, the sovereignty of Gorkha might fall into his own hands, refused to send him. Chandrarup Shah then bribed the nurse and attendants of Narbhupal Shah, and by their help he succeeded in having him brought to his own house in Gorkha, where he kept him carefully for three years. In the beginning of the fourth year, he one day sent him on the back of a slave into the presence of the Raja, who inquired who the boy was, but on being told by the slave that it was the Sahib ji (heir apparent), he said nothing. One day Nara Bhupal Shah was swimming naked and his whole body being exposed to the Raja's view, he exclaimed that he was an incarnation of Birbhadra Shah, and carrying him off to the Durbar, he seated himself on the gaddi with his grandson on his lap. He then called Chandrarup Shah, and praised him for his endeavours to restore his lost descendant. Giving him a pat on the back, he exclaimed : Syabas! You have done your duty to the utmost. My descendants will hereforth regards yours as their own brothers. Your jagirs and birtas will descent to your posterity rent free\\" After the death of Prithwi-pati, for the succession of Narbhupal Shah, there was much intrigue but because of the loyalty of Chandra Rup Shah and courtiers, he became the king without bloodshed. To him was born Prithvi Narayan Shah. Prithvi Narayan Shah took his seat on the gaddi, at the age of twelve, in Saka 1644 (1742 A.D.) Descendants Chandrarup Shah had two sons: Vishnurup Shah and Birbaha Shah. Vishburup Shah had only one son: Jiv Shah. Jiv Shah had three sons: Sri Chautaria Prana Shah (Granted the title of Sri Chautaria 1803), Shamsher Shah, and General H.E. Sri Chautariya Pushkar Shah.Chautariya Puskhar Shah General H.E. Sri Chautaria Pushkar Shah was born in 1784, educated privately. He served as the Governor of Doti 1831-1837, as a Special Ambassador to China 1837-1838, as Mukhtiyar (Prime Minister) 1838-1839, and as Councilor of State 1840-1843. He died in 1841. He has four sons: Sri Chautaria Bhim Bikram Shah, Rana Bikram Shah, Colonel Sri Chautaria Bir Bikram Shah, and Colonel Ambar Bikram Shah. Colonel Ambar Bikram Shah was killed by the Ranas for his part in the attempted coup d'√©tat, at Teku, January 1882. His son Jabber Jung escaped from Kathmandu disguised as a Jogi with his son Amar Jung Shah Shah to a village. Jabbar Jung's mission was to organize an army to topple the regime of Ranodeep Singh Kunwar. Jabbar's daughter was married to Maharaj Bhim Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana. She gave birth to Maharaj Padma Shumsher.

He is best known for his starring role in the film Dekalog: One directed by Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski, and also appeared as Rosa's brother Josef in Rosa Luxemburg directed by Margarethe von Trotta and as Napoleon in Pan Tadeusz directed by Andrzej Wajda. He directed over 60 theater and opera productions in Europe, Russia and the US and was the Artistic Director of the Teatr ≈ölƒÖski (Silesian Theatre) in Katowice in the mid 2000s. He also directed four \\"television theatre\\" productions: ...yes I will Yes (1992, adapted from Ulysses by James Joyce), For Phaedra (1998), Saint Witch (2003), and Night is the Mother of Day (2004). Early life Baranowski‚Äôs father Stanis≈Çaw Baranowski was a well-known conductor and violinist in the Lviv Philharmonic, and his mother Irena (n√©e Filbert) was the daughter of a Tsarist army officer in Kharkov. They met during the Second World War after the father had been transferred to the Kharkov opera following the Battle of Lw√≥w in 1939. In 1942, the couple attempted to move away from the war torn region to Crakow, but only got as far as Tarnopol. That fall, the father was killed while searching for food by members of the Banderites. Henryk was born in Tarnopol on 9 February 1943, four months after his father's death. In 1944, the Baranowski family was deported to Germany to work in a labor camp near Bremen, where they remained for the last year of the war. They stayed in the American Zone of Occupation for three years, then moved first to Kliczk√≥w in Lower Silesia then to Boles≈Çawiec. Baranowski studied mathematics at the University of Wroc≈Çaw and was a graduate of Philosophy at the University of Warsaw (1968) and the Director's Department at the State Theater School in Warsaw (1973). Theatre Baranowski made his directorial debut in 1973 at the Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw with The Maids by Jean Genet, and went on to direct several productions in theatres in Poland, including Man and Wife by Aleksander Fredro at the Teatr im. W. Bogus≈Çawski in Kalisz; Four of Them by Gabriela Zapolska at the Baltic Drama Theatre in Koszalin; Ghosts by Henrik Ibsen and Offending the Audience by Peter Handke at Teatr Polski in Bydgoszcz; Hello and Goodbye by Athol Fugard, The Castle by Franz Kafka, Princess Ivona by Witold Gombrowicz and Forefather's Eve by Adam Mickiewicz at the Theatre Jaracza in Olsztyn; School for Wives by Moli√®re at the Teatr Polski in Pozna≈Ñ; and Long Day‚Äôs Journey into Night by Eugene O‚ÄôNeill and Totenhorn by Kazimierz Truchanowski at the Teatr ≈ölƒÖski (Silesian Theatre) in Katowice. On the opening night of Totenhorn, Communist Party officials in attendance walked out, and the government shut down the production the next day. A literary conference was taking place nearby, and the writers organized a petition that reversed the decision. Baranowski staged one final production in Poland ‚Äì Kafka's The Trial at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw ‚Äì before leaving the country. Baranowski emigrated to West Berlin in 1980 and rose to prominence in the city's Freie Theater scene, co-founding the company and theatre school TransformTheater Berlin and the International Directing Seminar at the K√ºnstlerhaus Bethanien with Swiss filmmaker Bettina Wilhelm. Baranowski's stage adaptations of works by Joyce, Kafka and Dostoyevsky formed the core of TransformTheater Berlin's repertoire. In the early years, he mounted his productions in Berlin, but once the greater openness that followed the founding of Solidarity had been institutionalized, he renewed his work in Poland. Concurrently, he began working in regional theaters in Germany and internationally. His productions were presented at Berlin‚Äôs Hebbel am Ufer, the Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, the Mittelfest in Italy, the European Theatre Festival in Cracow, and numerous other festivals and venues in Poland, Germany, Russia, Italy, Norway and the USA. In the mid-1990s, he moved to a house in Brwin√≥w, a suburb of Warsaw. Baranowski made his English language debut with George Tabori's Peepshow in Chicago in 1991, which won a Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Ensemble. He went on to direct a number of other productions in the US in New York, Las Vegas, and Knoxville, Tennessee. In May 2001, he made his UK directing debut with an adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot, produced by The Playground at the Riverside Studios in London. Baranowski's 2009 production of Loneliness on the Net, adapted from the novel by Janusz Leon Wi≈õniewski, has remained in the repertoire of the 837-seat Main Stage of the Baltic House in Saint Petersburg, Russia through the 2017/18 season, almost a decade after its premiere.http://baltic- house.ru/en/theatre/repertoire/390/ Opera Later in his career, Baranowski‚Äôs attention turned increasing to opera. His production of Philip Glass‚Äô Akhnaten for the Teatr Wielki in ≈Åodzi won a Silver Boat for Best Production and a Golden Mask for Best Director. His staging of Alfred Schnittke's Life with an Idiot in a co-production by the Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre and Hahn Produktion in Berlin won three Russian Golden Mask Awards, including Best Production.

After three previews it premiered on Broadway November 6, 1899, at the Garrick Theatre in New York City. Background Recognizing the success of his character Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle decided to pen a play based on him. American theatrical producer Charles Frohman approached Conan Doyle and requested the rights to Holmes. While nothing came of their association at that time, it did inspire Conan Doyle to pen a five-act play featuring Holmes and Professor Moriarty. Upon reading the play, Frohman felt that it was unfit for production and instead persuaded Conan Doyle that actor William Gillette would be an ideal Holmes and would also be the perfect person to rewrite the play. Gillette, a successful playwright, donned a deerstalker and cape to visit Conan Doyle and request permission not only to perform the part but to rewrite it himself. Creation William Gillette as Holmes and Katherine Florence as Alice Faulkner in the 1899 Broadway production of Sherlock Holmes The play itself drew material from Conan Doyle's published stories \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Final Problem\\" and A Study in Scarlet, while adding much that was new as well. As the plot was largely taken from Doyle's canon, with some dialogue directly lifted from his original stories, Doyle was credited as a co-author, even though Gillette wrote the play. George Wessells as Moriarty in the 1899 Broadway production of Sherlock Holmes Gillette took great liberties with the character, such as giving Holmes a love interest. While Conan Doyle was initially uncomfortable with these additions, the success of the play softened his views; he said, \\"I was charmed both with the play, the acting, and the pecuniary result.\\" Doyle later recounted how he had received a cable from Gillette inquiring, \\"May I marry Holmes?\\", to which Conan Doyle replied, \\"You may marry him, murder him, or do anything you like to him.\\" The love interest was modelled on Irene Adler's role in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", with Gillette reinventing the character and renaming her \\"Alice Faulkner\\". Gillette's play features Professor Moriarty as the villain, but Gillette names him \\"Robert Moriarty\\". At this point no forename had been given for Moriarty in Conan Doyle's stories. Holmes (William Gillette) and his hypodermic, with Dr. Watson (Bruce McRae, left), in the 1899 Broadway production of Sherlock Holmes Conan Doyle had mentioned an unnamed pageboy in \\"A Case of Identity\\", and Gillette utilized the character and christened him \\"Billy\\". Conan Doyle himself would later reintroduce the character into some Holmes stories and continue using the name Billy.  Revisions  The text of the play was revised numerous times during its long series of runs. The original text of 1899 was revised with corrections in 1901. There was a further \\"corrected and expurgated text\\" of approximately 1923, and a final revision for the \\"farewell revival\\" of 1929‚Äì1930. When the play was published in book form (as opposed to a play script) by Doubleday, Doran & Company in 1935, further corrections were made, as described by Vincent Starrett in his introduction: > These have been carefully collated and separate scenes and situations of > still other corrected versions also have been examined. Finally, Mr. > Gillette has been frequently consulted. ... As made by Mr. Gillette, between > seasons or between revivals, the changes were intended to lend speed or > effectiveness to the drama as seen and heard by a theatre audience. Long > speeches were made into short ones, and some were dropped entirely; > references that had little or no bearing on the swift and chronological > development of the narrative were eliminated. Now that the play is intended > to be read, it has seemed well to replace some of the lines earlier removed, > and to eliminate certain later substitutions. In short, the play as now > published is believed to be an intelligent blend or fusion of all previous > texts, containing the best of each. Stage > directions‚Äîlights‚Äîposition‚Äîbusiness‚Äîwith which all existing manuscripts are > bursting, have been held to a minimum. Production Holmes (William Gillette, right) gets the drop on Moriarty (George Wessells) in the original Broadway production of Sherlock Holmes (1899) Sherlock Holmes was first seen at the Star Theatre in Buffalo, New York, October 23, 1899. After three previews it opened November 6, 1899, at the Garrick Theatre in New York City. The four-act drama was produced by Charles Frohman, with incidental music by William Furst and scenic design by Ernest Gros. Novel for its time, the production made scene changes with lighting alone.

Sherlock Holmes moved on to London's Lyceum Theatre in September 1901. During the London leg of the tour, a 13-year-old Charlie Chaplin played Billy the pageboy. The play finally closed after 200 performances. In 1903, H. A. Saintsbury took over the role from Gillette for a tour of Great Britain. Between this play and Conan Doyle's own stage adaptation of \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\", Saintsbury portrayed Holmes over 1,000 times. A burlesque of the play, Sheerluck Jones, or Why D‚ÄôGillette Him Off opened at Terry's Theatre in 1901 with Clarence Blakiston in the title role and ran for 138 performances.Marvin Lachman, The Villainous Stage: Crime Plays on Broadway and in the West End, MacFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers (2014) - Google Books pg. 30]Clarence Blakiston on Historical & Fictional Characters in Sherlockian Pastiches - Sherlockian Theatre Revivals Gillette revived Sherlock Holmes in 1905, 1906, 1910, and 1915. Gillette returned for a 45-performance run in 1929. In 1928 there was another brief Broadway revival with Robert Warwick as Holmes, Stanley Logan as Watson and Frank Keenan as Moriarty. The production opened February 20, 1928, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in New York City, and ran for 16 performances. The Royal Shakespeare Company revived the play in 1973. Directed by Frank Dunlop and starring John Wood as Holmes, the play was a huge success, which led to a move to Broadway in November 1974 and a subsequent tour. By the end of its Broadway run, the play had been performed 471 times. Wood was succeeded as Holmes by John Neville, Robert Stephens, and Leonard Nimoy; the first two had both played the detective before (Neville in A Study in Terror and Stephens in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.) Dunlop was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play. Frank Langella first performed the part in 1977 at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. He took on the role once more for a production taped for HBO's Standing Room Only program in 1981. This would be only the second theater production to be undertaken by HBO.  Adaptations  William Gillette (center) in the Essanay Studios film adaptation of the play, Sherlock Holmes (1916) In 1916, a silent film of the play also entitled Sherlock Holmes featured William Gillette in the role of Holmes and has been called \\"the most elaborate of the early movies\\".Phil Hardy, The BFI companion to crime (British Film Institute, 1997), p. 168 It is one of the earliest American film adaptations of the Holmes character. Long thought to be a lost film, a print of the film was found in the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise's collection in October 2014. It was restored and screened in 2015. The play was once again filmed in 1922, this time with John Barrymore donning the deerstalker.Joseph W. Garton, The film acting of John Barrymore (1980), p. 85 1932 brought another adaptation of Gillette's play, with Clive Brook taking over the role in Sherlock Holmes.Robert W. Pohle, Douglas C. Hart, Sherlock Holmes on the Screen: The Motion Picture Adventures of the World's Most Popular Detective (A. S. Barnes, 1977), pp. 100, 111, 113 On September 25, 1938, Orson Welles starred in his own radio adaption of Sherlock Holmes for The Mercury Theatre on the Air. The cast included Ray Collins as Dr. Watson, Mary Taylor as Alice Faulkner, Brenda Forbes as Madge Larrabee, Edgar Barrier as James Larrabee, Morgan Farley as Inspector Forman, Richard Wilson as Craigin, Alfred Shirley as Bassick, William Alland as Leary, Arthur Anderson as Billy, and Eustace Wyatt as Professor Moriarty. Music was conducted by Bernard Herrmann. The 1939 film The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, the second film to star Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, is credited as an adaptation of the play, though they bear little resemblance. In 1953, BBC Home Service dramatized the play with Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. In 1979 composer Raimonds Pauls and songwriter, poet JƒÅnis Peters wrote a musical ≈†erloks Holmss. It premiered in Dailes Theatre with Valentƒ´ns Skulme as Holmes and GunƒÅrs Placƒìns as Watson. There was a 2006 revival, again in Dailes Theatre. Cultural impact Gillette's Holmes is widely credited with being the first to utter \\"Elementary, my dear Watson\\"‚Äîa phrase that never appears in Conan Doyle's stories. It was also Gillette who introduced the famous curved pipe as a trademark Holmes prop.

Chhattiana known as \\"Greater Chhattiana\\" in area. History The tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Sahib came to this place after the Battle of Muktsar (then Khidrane Dee DhƒÅb, now Sri Muktsar Sahib) in 1705. His soldiers asked Him for their salary as they were not paid for some time. In the meantime, one Sikh presented before the Guru with the Daswandh (1/10th or 10% of one's income) that was the gold coins. The tenth Master started distributing these coins in His soldiers as salary. The soldiers were very happy but one of the Sikh-soldiers, Bhai Daan Singh, refused to take anything. When the Guru asked him that what he wants then, he replied that he wants the Sikhi, the baptism. The Guru pleased with the answer and remarked, \\"You have saved the honour of the faith for Malwa as Bhai Mahan Singh saved it for Majha\\". And then Bhai Daan Singh received the rites of the Khalsa. Peer/Pir Sayyad Ibrahim, popularly known as Peer Brahmi or Vehmi Peer, was a Muslim recluse of the place. He was greatly influenced by the personality of the tenth Master and His Sikhs and requested the Guru to make him a part of the Khalsa. He received the rites of the Khalsa in the hand of Bhai Maan Singh and got the name Ajmer Singh. Later he fought many battles from the Guru's side. After paying the Sikh-army the Guru buried the extra coins in the ground and named the place as Guptsar. After the Guru the villagers tried to get the coins but nothing found.History board at the Gurudwara Sahib (nowadays) Today, a beautiful Gurudwara Sahib, known as Gurudwara Guptsar Sahib, located outside (2 km) of the village, marks the site (see picture above).

If it was a genuine Demosthenic speech, it is likely that it was issued in pamphlet form rather than actually delivered as a speech. Historical background In 341 BC, when the embassy for which Demosthenes is calling in his fourth Philippic is sent to the Persians, Philip of Macedon is angry. Yet, the Persians reject the embassy. Content of the speech In the Fourth Philippic, Demosthenes asks that money be sent because of an upcoming war with Macedon. He calls for Athens to send an embassy to the Persians.

Nora Gilpin (Young), a prim and proper nurse, is engaged to the stuffy Tim (John Ridgely). Unknown to both, Nora is a sleepwalker; during her nocturnal forays, the less-inhibited side of her personality takes over. Plot No-nonsense nurse Nora Gilpin (Young) does not care much for John Raymond Jr. (Cotten), a famous, rich lawyer. Her immediate plans are to marry Tim McCarey (Ridgely), a building contractor, and settle down to a nice, normal life. That night, a sleepwalking Nora slips into a provocative dress and goes to the home of a startled John, behaving seductively. She does not reveal her name and he cannot figure out where they have met. They spend several hours together, but she then gets away before John notices. John spots her on the street one day and excitedly brings up their evening together, but Nora has no idea what he is talking about and is greatly embarrassed, because this happens in front of Tim. She tells John he has misidentified her, and they rush away, leaving John confused. Later, as John is leaving by train on a business trip, Nora pops up again, playfully enticing him and then cavorting with him for hours at an amusement park, until the wee hours of the morning. Dr. Jackson (Basil Ruysdael) is consulted about sleepwalking and thinks Nora's behavior must stem from something in her past. John realizes that he knew her many years ago as the gardener's daughter, but Nora adamantly denies it, continuing to prepare for her wedding day. She packs a suitcase for her honeymoon, but that night, while John waits outside, sure enough, Nora appears again. He rushes her to a justice of the peace and they are married. She wakes up the next morning (with John in the adjoining bed) in a motel. Surprised, embarrassed, and unnerved, she hurries to her wedding (with Tim), only to have John interrupt the ceremony by claiming she is already married. Nora faints, but comes to and finally realizes whom she truly loves.

His rise to power was linked to his World War I experience of knowing both Hermann G√∂ring and Bruno Loerzer. He began his military career prior to World War I, becoming an officer candidate in October 1913. He first met G√∂ring during 1914. Dahlmann served with ground forces until 25 July 1915, when he transferred to aviation for aerial observer training. He would serve in aviation until war's end, being entrusted by Loerzer with the adjutant's duties for one of the world's first fighter wings, Jagdgeschwader III. Through Loerzer, Dahlmann would come to better know G√∂ring, who was Loerzer's friend. Dahlmann ended World War I as a decorated fighter ace credited with seven aerial victories. Nevertheless, he did not remain in German military aviation, which had been greatly restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. The decades between the World Wars were spent serving first in police duties, then as a civil servant. By 1 August 1939, when Dahlmann transferred back to aviation by joining the Luftwaffe, he was the civil service equivalent of a colonel. The transfer back to aviation placed Dahlmann under G√∂ring's command, despite the former's private reservations about the latter. Dahlmann would serve in training and personnel management positions until 8 July 1942. He then became a special assistant to Generalfeldmarshall Erhard Milch. On 1 December 1943, Dahlmann was promoted to generalleutnant and placed in charge of the Luftwaffe's flight security, flight operations, and ground organization. He would serve in this role right through to war's end. He was then imprisoned until August 1947. Early life Theodor Hermann Dahlmann was born on 19 November 1892 in Wanfried, Eschwege District, Germany. In later years, he would be known as simply Hermann Dahlmann.Above the Lines, p. 95. Hermannn Dahlmann joined the German Army by becoming an officer candidate, being appointed as a Fahnrich and platoon leader in the 82nd Infantry Regiment on 15 October 1913. He was detached to the War School at Anklam on 1 November 1913. World War I Dahlmann returned to the 82nd Regiment and was promoted to Leutnant on 1 August 1914. He went on convalescent leave on 25 September 1914. On 28 October 1914, he began service with the Fortress Machine Gun Battalion Borkum. Dahlmann first met Hermann G√∂ring, under whom he would serve in the Third Reich, sometime in 1914.G√∂ring: The Rise and Fall of the Notorious Nazi Leader, Note 4 to Chapter 1. On 21 May 1915, Dahlmann moved to the Replacement Machine Gun Battalion of the XI Armee Corps Kassel. From there, he was detached to aviation training with Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 3 at Gotha on 25 July 1915. He then moved to Cologne to take aerial observer training with the Fliegerersatz-Abteilung 7, beginning 15 August 1915. Rather unusually, he returned to Gotha for pilot's training on 20 September 1915. On 10 May 1916, he was assigned to Bialystok. On 15 June 1916, he was assigned to Feldflieger Abteilung 63 to fly reconnaissance duty in two-seater airplanes. On 15 November 1916 he transferred to Flieger- Abteilung (Artillerie) 252; this unit's duties included artillery fire direction as well as reconnaissance. He then moved up to flying single-seater scouts; from 15 March to 19 October 1917, he was posted to a fighter squadron, Jagdstaffel 29. On 1 June 1917, he became a balloon buster by downing an enemy observation balloon for his first aerial victory.Above the Lines, p. 95. On 20 October 1917, he was removed from combat and stationed at the Armee Flight Park in Wilna. On 15 November he began leadership duties in training new aviators, first at Bromberg, then at Graudenz. He was promoted to oberleutnant on 27 January 1918. Dahlmann returned to front line duty on 25 May 1918, being assigned to Jagdgeschwader III to serve under Bruno Loerzer; on 15 August, he became JG III's adjutant. He scored his second aerial victory on 14 August while flying with Jagdstaffel 26. After becoming adjutant, he continued to fly with Jasta 26 and scored five more victories, which were credited to the wing.Above the Lines, p. 95. Loerzer followed a similar pattern, having been Jasta 26's Staffelf√ºhrer before succeeding to command of JG III.Above the Lines, p.156. The Fokker D.VIIs in use by both Dahlmann and Loerzer during September 1918 bore similar striking white and black patterns. In Dahlmann's case, that meant a black cowling leading the way, with wide black and white bands alternating around the fuselage. An abstract diving hawk was emblazoned in black on the white band circling the fuselage just behind the cockpit. The more usual Iron Cross national marking had been stylized into a + sign cross in black on the next white band aft of the hawk, as well as painted black on white on the Fokker's vertical stabilizer.Fokker D.VII Aces of World War I, Part I, p. 41. Dahlmann served as the wing's adjutant until the end of the war, not giving up the position until 19 November 1918. The experience left him with definite opinions about Hermann G√∂ring, although Dahlmann would express those opinions only in later years. According to Dahlmann, Goering received the Pour le Merite on 2 June 1918 with only 18 victories because Loerzer lobbied the high command on G√∂ring's behalf.Goering: The Rise and Fall of the Notorious Nazi Leader, Note 4 to Chapter 1. It seems that Loerzer and G√∂ring were old friends, having served together in the same infantry regiment, and as a reconnaissance air crew from October 1914 to June 1915,Above the Lines, p.156. as well as serving together in Jasta 26 from February through May 1917.Above the Lines, p.117. According to Dahlmann, the premature award, as well as G√∂ring's arrogance, made him an unpopular commander with his men.G√∂ring: The Rise and Fall of the Notorious Nazi Leader, Note 4 to Chapter 1. Between the World Wars After Dahlmann's duties as adjutant of JG III ended 19 November 1918, he was assigned back to FEA 3 at Gotha for demobilization. On 1 February 1919 he became adjutant of the aerodrome there. He transitioned to police service in Berlin on 15 July 1919, serving in various command positions, including that of the air police, until transferring into civil service. During this time, he became a police oberleutnant on 2 April 1920 and was promoted to hauptmann on 20 May 1921. His civil service employment saw him increasingly involved in aviation administration until the beginning of World War II. He was promoted thrice, becoming the civil service equivalent of a colonel on 28 July 1934. He transferred to the Luftwaffe as the Department Chief of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (Air Ministry) on 1 August 1939, thus placing himself under G√∂ring's command. World War II and beyond On 3 November 1939, his responsibilities changed, as he became responsible for both pilot training and the air base at Danzig. From this personnel management position, he would transfer into four different commandant slots for commanding airports or regions of airports. On 1 December 1941, during the last of these commandant positions, he was promoted to Generalmajor. From 8 July 1942 through 30 November 1943, he served as a special assistant to Generalfeldmarshall Erhard Milch. On 1 December 1943 Dahlmann was promoted to generalleutnant and entrusted with the flight security, flight operations, and ground organization of the Luftwaffe. He served in that capacity until 8 May 1945, VE Day, when he was captured. He would not be released until August 1947. Dahlmann died on 21 January 1978, in Rimsteig, Germany aged 85.

First published by Odhams in 1944, History of the World ran to three editions, the second edition in 1959, and the third in 1965. The editor, W.N. Weech, wrote in the Preface: > \\"This book is designed for the ordinary man or woman, who should have no > difficulty in getting through it in a month, though many may prefer to > compress their first reading of it into a fortnight.\\" W.N. Weech's History of the World is notable for bearing comparison with Ernst Gombrich's best-selling Little History of the World, a book that is shorter and is addressed to younger readers. (Gombrich, a Jewish √©migr√© from Vienna, was an art historian better known for his classic work, The Story of Art.) Weech's book is noteworthy, not only for being both thorough and accessible, but also (not unlike Gombrich's) for maintaining a tolerant and measured style, despite being written during the dark days of Nazism. A contributor at the 2011 Hay Festival cited Weech's book as a remarkable discovery. Each chapter has a separate author, as follows: There are many authors that have their own ideas  Chapter Titles (of the first edition) #Civilizations of the Near East - E.H. Weech (aka \\"Bubbles\\"), the editor's daughter #The Glory of Greece - Roger Roberts (Headmaster of Blundell's School) #The Roman World - Basil Garnon Williams (Classics Master, Marlborough College) #The Story of Persia - W.N. Weech & G.P. Churchill (Teheran Legation & Algiers Consulate) # Mongols, Tartars and Turks - Sir E.

MacLaughlin (History Tutor at Stowe School) #The Latest Age - Lt-Colonel David Ayerst (Headmaster of King Edward VII School, Lytham) #Epilogue - W.N. Weech Curiously, the 1944 first edition does not state its publication date. The latest event it records is the Japanese expansion into the Pacific zone after their bombing of Pearl Harbour in December, 1941. The book is printed on poor- quality wartime paper, which is all that was available at that stage of the Second World War. In the Preface, W.N. Weech adds, \\"I owe a debt of gratitude to my publishers for producing this History of the World in spite of all the present difficulties ...\\", \\"present difficulties\\" presumably being an understatement for the War. The dust jacket of the first edition has two illustrations on the front and back, with numerous notable names from history. On the front cover are Wellington, Nelson, Lincoln, Napoleon, King William, Henry VIII, Custer, Bismarck, Charlemagne, and unidentified fighters of the RAF, the British Army and Royal Navy and the Afrika Korps. On the back we find Jesus Christ, an Arab (who may be Mohammed), Julius Caesar, Tutankhamen and others, including a Viking, a Mongol, an Assyrian and a Greek.

After being planned in the early 1970s, construction on the plant began in June 1977 and commercial operations began on 30 June 1984. It has an installed capacity of 1,212 MW and is owned by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Design and operation The power plant operates by moving water between an upper and lower reservoir. When energy demand is high, water is released from the upper reservoir to the generating plant and the water is discharged into the lower reservoir. When demand is low (such as at night), water is pumped into the upper reservoir to be used as stored energy at a later time. This is accomplished by pump-generators which serve a dual role: the pumps can reverse for use as generators. The plant can go from a stand still to operational in eight minutes which allows it to meet peak energy demand. It consumes more electricity pumping than generating electricity but pumping occurs during periods of low demand with unused surplus energy available at lower costs from the electric grid. The upper reservoir, Courtright Reservoir, has a storage capacity of is at altitude of . Wishon Reservoir, the lower reservoir, has a storage capacity of . It is at an altitude of . Connecting the reservoirs, from upper to lower, is first a long head-race tunnel which turns into a long steel penstock which drops in elevation and splits into three individual penstocks which feed a separate pump-generator. After the water has passed through the generating turbines, it is discharged into the lower reservoir via a long tail-race tunnel. The difference in elevation between the reservoirs has an effective hydraulic head (drop of the water) of .

The club participates in South Lancs/Cheshire 1. Club FormationSouthport Rugby Football Club website \\"Club History\\" Southport Football Club was founded on 29 November 1872 and is one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world. The first president of the club was Samuel Swire, the Mayor of Southport. In line with the origins of the modern game, the club was originally composed of old public school boys, and was formed with the intention of improving the physical development of our young townsmen. The driving force behind the formation of the club was Dr George Coombe (later Sir George Augustus Pilkington) of Southport Infirmary. The first ground is recorded as being a large field next to the Alexandra Cricket Club in Manchester Road, which from an ordnance survey map at the time appears behind Hartwood Road area with access off Roe Lane. The club was one of several playing the handling code in the town, and other teams under the titles Southport Olympic, Southport Wasps, Southport Hornets and The Grasshoppers are recorded. The fixture list included Birkenhead Park FC away, a drawn game, no score, with teams twenty a side. History The Early Years (1872-1918) The 'List of Matches' for 1879 records the club's colours as being blue, white and red, and the ground as Roe Lane, Southport. In 1881, after some heavy defeats, Southport Football Club switched to association football. Most of the rugby players made the switch to the round ball game, and with a lack of new recruits, the original club faded out. There was a merger with Southport Olympic and Southport Wasps, and games were played at a ground at the corner of Scarisbrick New Road and Ash Street, backing onto Southbank Road. Records show that Southport Olympic drew one game with Liverpool Old Boys. The Lancashire County Rugby Football Union was formed in Manchester in the same year, but Southport was not represented. The club's familiar red, black and amber colours were first mentioned in a game with New Brighton in February 1888. After a number of years of little or no rugby due to inter-club conflicts over professional versus amateur status (which led to a number of clubs breaking away to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (the Rugby Football League), Southport Olympic completely reformed at Victoria Park, Southport and rejoined the Lancashire County Rugby Football Union in 1906. In April 1913, a proposal to drop the Olympic name in favour of Southport Rugby Union Football Club was carried at a general meeting. When Britain joined the First World War in September 1914, an extraordinary meeting of the club cancelled all fixtures and recommended that all members 'join some military organisation'. Fourteen club members lost their lives in the war, including the 1914 club captain J.E. Grimshaw, who was killed in the Gallipoli Campaign while serving with the Lancashire Fusiliers. Between The Wars (1919-1945) The club returned to playing fixtures in 1919, and by 1922 it had regained some of its former strength with 75 players and 176 patrons. The year 1926 saw the start of the last season at Victoria Park, and on 26 March 1927 the club celebrated the opening of the new ground at Waterloo Road with a victory over Preston Grasshoppers. During World War II, the government requisitioned the ground and the pavilion, and there is no record of the club playing rugby during this period. Twenty seven members lost their lives in the war, including six first XV players. Modern Club Southport RFC's first XV currently plays in South Lancashire & Cheshire 1 in the Rugby Football Union Northern Division, and the club fields many sides at all age levels. *Senior: First XV, Second XV, Third XV, Ladies, U18 Colts *Junior: U13s to U17 Colts *Mini: U6s to U12s Club Honours Senior: *South Lancs/Cheshire 2 champions: 1996‚Äì97 *North West 3 champions: 1997‚Äì98 *South Lancs/Cheshire 3 champions: 2006‚Äì07 *Merseyside (West) champions: 2015‚Äì16 Junior: * Lancashire Colts Cup champions (2): 1972‚Äì73, 2018‚Äì19 U18 RFU Northern Plate champions: 2017‚Äì18 Lancashire under 16s cup champions: 2016‚Äì17 References   External links *Southport Rugby Football Club website Category:English rugby union teams Category:Rugby clubs established in 1872 ","title":"Southport Rugby Football Club"},{"id":"34387013","text":"Francis Augustus Ligonier (1693 - 25 January 1746) was a French-born officer of the British Army.

The previous colonel of the 13th, James Gardiner, had been killed at the Battle of Prestonpans after being deserted by his men, and George II gave the regiment to Ligonier saying he \\"would give them an officer who should show them how to fight\\". Ligonier held both colonelcies simultaneously, a rare occurrence. Though previously confined to bed with a chest infection, Ligonier took over command of a brigade of Henry Hawley's dragoons for the Battle of Falkirk Muir on 16 January 1746. He contracted pleurisy and died at Edinburgh on 25 January, where he was buried five days later. John Ligonier erected a monument to his brother in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey. The sculptor was Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac and the inscription reads: Ligonier left two illegitimate children from a relationship with a widow named Anne Murray (n√©e Freeman): Edward and Frances. Care of the children was given to their uncle John Ligonier, and Edward was made heir- apparent to the title of Viscount Ligonier of Clonmell created in 1762, succeeding on his uncle's death in 1770. Frances married Colonel Thomas Balfour (1752‚Äì1799) and was the mother of the novelist Mary Brunton.Isabelle Bour, \\"Brunton, Mary (1778‚Äì1818)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2005 accessed 15 Jan 2012 References Category:1693 births Category:1746 deaths Category:Suffolk Regiment officers Category:Royal Horse Guards officers Category:9th Queen's Royal Lancers officers Category:7th Dragoon Guards officers Category:48th Regiment of Foot officers Category:13th Hussars officers Category:British Army personnel of the War of the Austrian Succession Category:British Army personnel of the Jacobite rising of 1745 ","title":"Francis Ligonier"},{"id":"34387020","text":"Vrankoviƒá is a mostly Croatian, and sometimes Serbian and Slovak surname, derived from the male given name Vranko. It is one of the more common Croatian surnames. About 470 individuals have it as their surname, chiefly Croats, and in lesser numbers Serbs (around Koprivnica) and Slovaks (around Ilok). Etymology In the opinion of priest Dr. Karl Juri≈°iƒá, the surname Vrankoviƒá probably comes from a wide range of patronymic surnames derived from the ancestor's name, which in this case bore the name \\"Vranko\\", ie \\"Franko\\" (= Franjo), and the possessive supplement \\"-ov\\" and suffix ie \\"-iƒá\\". A similar view is taken by academic Petar Simunoviƒá. Origin According to the Encyclopedia of Croatian Surnames (in Croatian, Enciklopediji hrvatskih prezimena), the Vrankoviƒá family name first appeared in Blato na Cetina. The surname extremely similar origin and meaning to the almost identical surname Frankoviƒá (also the Franiƒá family name) in use today, from which Vrankoviƒá seems to have spread over all parts of Croatia over the centuries, and during the 19th and 20th centuries the world. On the island of Hvar, on which they are most numerous today, the Vrankoviƒás are first mentioned in the mid-15th century, in the village of Dol, from where they moved to Stari Grad, and towards the end of the 18th century to the village of Svirƒçe. It is interesting to mention that the Vrankovic family from the Old Town, just before the collapse of Austria-Hungary empire, received Hungarian nobility status. Prevalence According to the Encyclopedia of Croatian Surnames, published by the National Genealogy Center in 2008, a relatively large number of Vrankoviƒá's have been born in Svirƒçe, on the island of Hvar in the past 100 years, where one in every seventh person has the surname Vrankovic.

A survey conducted in the reign of Edward II of England listed it as being Gordale in Appletreewick. Speight suggests that this is of Danish influence from the word geir; a triangular piece of land that ends in a chasm. Skyreholme Beck flows through the gorge, but for most of the year the stream bed is dry with the water flowing underground. The Gill is also the location of an old lead and later fluorspar mine which was last worked in the 1960s. Legends Legend has it that the Gill is the home of the mythical monstrous black dog Barghest who can turn one to stone with a look. It has also been suggested by some that the Barghest story was a major influence on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when he was penning The Hound of the Baskervilles. Local folklore declared that trolls lived in the gorge (hence its name) and would push stones down from the deep sides to people travelling up and down the gorge.

Produced by Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra under their banners of Annapurna Studios and SS Creations, Siva starred Nagarjuna, Amala, and Raghuvaran. The film's basic plot, adapted from The Way of the Dragon (1972), revolves around the conflict between college student-turned-gangster Siva and Bhavani, a reputed crime boss mentored by the politician Machiraju. Siva explores the concepts of student exploitation by anti-social elements and the impact of crowd psychology. Varma's script was based on his experiences as a student at Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada. Tanikella Bharani wrote the dialogue. Ilaiyaraaja composed Siva soundtrack and score, and S. Gopala Reddy was its cinematographer. Thota Tharani and Sattibabu were the film's art director and editor, respectively. Its principal photography began on 16 February 1989, and was completed in 55 working days. Except for three days of shooting in Madras (now Chennai), Siva was filmed in Andhra Pradesh. Produced on a budget of 7.5 million, Siva was released on 5 October 1989 to critical acclaim, primarily for its technology and sound design. Although Venkat and Surendra expected the film to have average earnings, it was commercially successful; Siva completed a 100-day run in 22 centres and a 175-day run in five centres. It was screened in the mainstream section of the International Film Festival of India, held on 19 January 1990. In addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Telugu, Siva won three Nandi Awards: Best Director (Varma), Best First Film of a Director, and Best Dialogue Writer (Bharani). A documentary titled Exploring Shiva after 25 Years was released on the film's silver anniversary; it is the first documentary about a Telugu film. Siva, which attained cult status, is considered Nagarjuna's breakthrough film. It is credited with the introduction of steadicam and new sound recording techniques in Telugu cinema, encouraging filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental films. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included Siva on its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time. Its Tamil-dubbed version, Udhayam, was also successful. Varma remade the film twice in Hindi with the same title. The first, featuring Nagarjuna and Amala reprising their roles, performed well at the box office, but the second did not.  Plot  Siva, a student, comes to Vijayawada from a nearby town to pursue his education. He lives with his brother Sharath's family, and enrolls in the VAS College of Arts and Sciences. Although Sharath and his daughter Keerthi get along well with Siva, his wife considers him a financial burden. Siva befriends a group of students and falls in love with Asha, sister of the honest police inspector Venkat. The college's (unopposed) student-union president, J. Durga Rao (known as J. D.) is the lowest rung in a gang ladder reaching through the gangster Ganesh to Bhavani, a crime boss. Bhavani uses the network to support his mentor Machiraju, a politician. Although J. D. is arrested many times, Bhavani continues to bail him out. When J. D. teases Asha on campus, Siva attacks him with a bicycle chain; a rivalry then develops between him and Ganesh. The incident encourages Siva's friends to ask him to stand for the student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh's attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him. Naresh is fatally assaulted by J. D. and Bhavani's henchmen, and is taken to hospital. Siva retaliates, infuriating Bhavani. When Siva's friends attend a wedding, they are attacked by Ganesh and others. One of Siva's friends, Malli, is murdered and Siva swears revenge. Sensing a risk to Sharath's family after an attempt on Keerthi's life, Siva leaves their house and moves into his friend Chinna's hostel. He agrees to contest the student-union presidential election. Bhavani cheats labour-union leader Krishna Reddy, who changes his allegiance to Siva. Around this time, Asha and Siva marry. Bhavani begins attacking and murdering Siva's close aides, and Siva ensures that Sharath relocates to Visakhapatnam as a part of his job. Siva attacks Bhavani's henchmen, and helps Venkat arrest Ganesh. Machiraju sees Siva as a potential replacement for Bhavani, and stops supporting the latter. Bhavani learns about Siva's relationship to Sharath, and kidnaps Keerthi. Ganesh appears in court, and an arrest warrant is issued for Bhavani. Insulted and humiliated, Bhavani kills Keerthi and Machiraju. Siva and Bhavani later duel on a shopping-complex terrace. Bhavani commits suicide, and Siva walks out as Asha and Venkat watch in dismay.

Noting his son's interest in films, Penmatsa Krishnamraju (a former sound recordist for Annapurna Studios) helped Varma join the teams of Collector Gari Abbai (1987) and Rao Gari Illu (1988) as an assistant director. Varma befriended actor Nagarjuna, and filmmakers Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra. He presented his script for Raathri to them. When Nagarjuna rejected it, Varma presented another script based on his life as a student in Vijayawada. He earlier narrated this script to filmmaker K. Raghavendra Rao who suggested few changes because of its serious tone. Varma watched Rao's Kaliyuga Pandavulu (1986) and backed out after understanding Rao's point of view. When Rao Gari Illu was nearly completed, Varma asked co- director Siva Nageswara Rao to join him. He approached Tanikella Bharani to write the dialogue after observing his work in Ladies Tailor (1985) and Sri Kanaka Mahalakshmi Recording Dance Troupe (1987). Bharani found the plot (as described by Varma) similar to those of K. S. R. Das' films. Varma rejected Bharani's comic version, and asked to rewrite it as a crime drama. Although Bharani's usual fee was 25,000, he received 35,000 for Siva. Gunasekhar and Teja, who later pursued career as filmmakers, joined the film's crew as assistant directors. Venkat and Surendra produced Siva under their banners of Annapurna Studios and SS Creations, respectively. The production began in February 1989. Varma wanted M. M. Keeravani to compose the film's soundtrack and score, since Keeravani had assisted K. Chakravarthy on Rao Gari Illu. As both were inexperienced, Keeravani suggested that Varma choose a more seasoned technician and Ilaiyaraaja was signed instead. S. Gopala Reddy, Thota Tharani and Sattibabu were the film's director of photography, art director and editor, respectively. Gopala Reddy was inspired by Gordon Willis' work in the crime film, The Godfather (1972).  Casting  Siva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma found him the only actor who could understand his perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma had discussed astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna to work with him. Amala, who worked with Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), was chosen as the female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, she agreed to dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage. Varma chose Raghuvaran to play the local crime boss, Bhavani. Varma wanted him to underplay the character, which was based on real life. Before accepting the role, Raghuvaran studied the mannerisms and lifestyles of mob leaders and criminals in Mumbai for 20 days. Varma wanted to name the characters played by Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran as Bhavani and Siva respectively. At Nagarjuna's request, he reversed the names. Varma chose newcomers Chakravarthy, Jithendra, and Ramjagan to play J. D., Chinna, and Naresh after auditioning them at Annapurna Studios. Uttej, one of Varma's assistant directors, played a comic role of a server in the college canteen. He recommended Varma to cast Sushma for Keerthi's role. P. Sai Kumar was initially supposed to play J. D., but the role went to Chakravarthy. Varma met the latter on the film's sets and asked him to perform a scene of his choice. Despite an unsuccessful screen test, Varma selected Chakravarthy after a meeting on the next day after observing the depth in his expression. Seasoned actors such as Murali Mohan, Gollapudi Maruti Rao, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Subhalekha Sudhakar, and Saichand played supporting roles. Bharani agreed to play Bhavani's assistant, Nanaji, at Varma's insistence. Producer Akkineni Venkat made a cameo appearance as one of Bhavani's clients, and Siva Nageswara Rao dubbed his portion. Brahmaji was cast as Bhavani's henchman.  Filming  Varma read about steadicam in American Cinematographer, and enquired about the possibility of a similar camera in India. After learning that steadicam was available in Chennai for four years and was already obsolete, Varma decided to use it despite Gopala Reddy's apprehension. Varma chose Rasool Ellore over Rajiv Menon and Deenpal to assist Gopala Reddy with the steadicam. Principal photography began on 16 February 1989, and wrapped in 55 working days. Except for three days in Chennai, the film was shot in Andhra Pradesh. The scenes of the protagonist's college life were filmed at Keyes High school, near Secunderabad Junction railway station. A school wall was demolished and a gate was repaired for the film's opening scene. Raghuvaran was carried away during the shoot of few action sequences and slapped Brahmaji for nearly six times in a row. To avoid such issues in the case of murder scenes, Varma decided to complete few of them by using plain close-ups of the victims. Sudhakar's murder scene was filmed near Keesara in Ranga Reddy district. Gopala Reddy and Ellore placed a camera in a bag and ran behind him for a shaky effect. In the cycle-chain scene in which Siva uses a cycle chain to fight with J. D., the hand pulling the chain was Ellore's; in the next shot, Nagarjuna is shown holding the chain. The scene in which Naresh is killed near his home was filmed in the streets of Vengala Rao Nagar. The cycle chase scenes were filmed in Somajiguda and the slums behind Yashoda Hospitals. The bus chase scene was shot in Yusufguda. The film's climax was filmed at the Swapnalok complex in Secunderabad, and Bhavani's suicide was filmed on a set at Venus Studios in Chennai. Several romantic scenes with Nagarjuna and Amala were initially filmed at Ushakiron Movies in Secunderabad. Dissatisfied with the results, Varma reshot them at the Osman Ali House. Mugur Sundar choreographed the songs, and \\"Anando Brahma\\" was filmed at the Borra Caves in Visakhapatnam. The film crew had to crawl into the caves, making Siva the first Telugu film shot in its interiors. The remaining songs were filmed on sets at Annapurna Studios. Srinivasa Rao filmed his scenes in one day. The fights, choreographed by Varma, featured hand-to-hand combat and attacks with hooks as he was trained in kickboxing.  Themes and influences  Siva plot was adapted from The Way of the Dragon (1972), produced and directed by and starring Bruce Lee. Siva explores the exploitation of students by anti-social elements against a mafia backdrop and the impact on them of crowd psychology. It also focuses on politics and betrayal in the scene where Bhavani murders Machiraju and his enemy Viswanadham. As a student, Varma observed and participated in gang wars and student politics besides analysing the impact of a gangster's lifestyle and body language on students. Those experiences inspired him to begin writing Siva. Most of the characters, including Bhavani, were inspired by real life. Bhavani was based on Radha, an actual crime boss with a reputation for violence in Vijayawada; Bhavani, like Radha, is also a woman's name. Siva's character was comparatively fictitious whom Varma considered an \\"ideal person\\" making the society \\"too dramatic\\". Siva was partially based on Varma's friend, Golla Ravi, who lived in Punjagutta. Assistant director Krishna Vamsi found the film's story similar to Arjun (1985). Varma said that Arjun was an inspiration for Siva, since Sunny Deol title character in Arjun was a hero who \\"does not bend to forces larger than himself\\". Apart from Arjun, Varma was also inspired by Ardh Satya (1983) and Kaal Chakra (1988). The basic plot of The Way of the Dragon (1972) was adapted by Varma for Siva. In The Way of the Dragon, Tang Lung (Bruce Lee) comes from Hong Kong to work in a Chinese restaurant in Rome and fights local gangsters who try to intimidate the owners; this leads to a rivalry with a crime boss (Chuck Norris). In Siva, Nagarjuna comes from a nearby town to Vijayawada to further his education, fights gangsters and develops a rivalry with Raghuvaran. While Lee and Norris fight at the Colosseum at the climax of The Way of the Dragon, Nagarjuna and Raghuvaran duel on a building terrace in Siva. In addition to The Way of the Dragon, Varma adapted scenes from a number of other films. Malli's mother slapping a police inspector for failing to save him was inspired by Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975), and the cycle chase scene was based on a similar scene in Arjun. A scene in which goons demand donations to build a temple for Ganesha was from Kaal Chakra. Although Varma wanted to film a fight between Nagarjuna and Chakravarthy during a football match (based on a similar scene in 1978's Damien: Omen II), Venkat was indifferent to the idea.  Music  The five-song soundtrack album and background score of Siva were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with Veturi writing the lyrics of \\"Anando Brahma\\", \\"Enniyallo\\", and \\"Kiss Me Hello\\". Sirivennela Sitaramasastri wrote the lyrics for the remaining two songs: \\"Botany\\" and \\"Sarasalu\\". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, S. Janaki, K. S. Chithra, and Mano were the singers. Due to a strike in Madras, Ilaiyaraaja and Varma completed the background score in Mumbai. The producers suggested Varma to use stock tunes instead for the score. Nagarjuna noticed this and asked them to provide what Varma asked for, and offered to pay the additional expenses incurred if any. For an action scene, Ilaiyaraaja used moving string music; when Varma asked why, he answered: \\"They have come here to study and they are fighting. So I just felt sad for them\\". Varma was impressed with Deepan Chatterjee's work in Sindhoora Puvvu (1988) and recruited him as Siva sound designer. Ismail Darbar, who later composed the music for Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (1999) and Devdas (2002), worked with Ilaiyaraaja on Siva as a violinist. The soundtrack was successful, and Chatterjee's sound design was critically acclaimed. Varma dedicated the background score of his Rowdy (2014), composed by Sai Karthik, to Ilaiyaraaja. Adapting the background score of the cycle-chase scene in Rowdy, Varma said that his main interest was \\"to bring back this composition to express the great idea of the genius [Ilaiyaraaja's] 1989 soundtrack (of Siva) to 2014\\".  Release  Siva was produced on a budget of 7.5 million. Venkat and Surendra retained the distribution rights for Nizam, Vishakhapatnam and the East and West Godavari regions. The film was released on 5 October 1989, It was screened in the mainstream section of the International Film Festival of India, held on 19 January 1990 at the Empire Theatre in Kolkata. The Tamil remake rights to Siva were initially sold for 100,000. After the film's release, Venkat and Surendra dubbed it into Tamil as Udhayam and sold its distribution rights for 8.5 million. It was released on 12 January 1990 in 24 centres.  Reception  The film received was praised for its usage of technology and sound design. The distributors were concerned about the film's violence, saying that it would alienate women and families, whom the film industry believed were the majority of the audience. Although Venkat and Surendra expected that the film would have average earnings, Siva was a commercial success and earned 10 million in the Nizam region alone (a first in Telugu cinema). In addition to 50,000, Varma received five percent of Siva profits. The film had a 100-day run in 22 centres and a 175-day run in five centres. The Tamil version Udhayam was commercially successful and earned more than 20 million. Nagarjuna's father Akkineni Nageswara Rao advised Varma to place an advertisement thanking the audience for the film's success. Varma opposed it, believing that a film's success should be credited to the production team and its failure attributed to the director. When Varma's second film, Kshana Kshanam (1991) under-performed at the box office, Siva success was considered accidental. For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema CNN-News18 included Siva on its list of 100 greatest Indian films of all time, calling it a \\"completely new take on student politics and the ideologies driving it\\" and saying that the film's ideas \\"found a reflection in many university elections during a later stage\\".  Awards  In addition to the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Telugu, Siva won three Nandi Awards: Best Director (Varma), Best First Film of a Director, and Best Dialogue Writer (Bharani).  Remakes  Siva was remade by Varma in Hindi as Shiva in 1990, and was Nagarjuna's acting debut in Hindi cinema. It was the last Hindi film with Amala in a lead role. Minor changes were made to the remake's cast and crew. All the songs in the Telugu version were used unchanged except for \\"Botany\\", which was reshot at Acharya N. G. Ranga Agricultural University in Rajendranagar. Telugu filmmaker Puri Jagannadh was cast as one of Nagarjuna's friends in the remake. Jagannadh wanted to assist Varma and approached him for an opportunity. Varma insisted Jagannadh to act and he obliged, feeling that this experience would teach him something. Produced in association with Atluri Purnachandra Rao on a budget of 11.5 million, Shiva was released on 7 December 1990 and was successful in Mumbai and Kolkata. During the production of James (2005), Varma planned to remake Siva. The second remake, also entitled Shiva, featured Mohit Ahlawat and Priyanka Kothari as the characters played by Nagarjuna and Amala in the original. Unlike Siva, the protagonist in the second remake is an honest man who joins the Mumbai Police as a new recruit; the cycle-chain scene and Raghuvaran's character were omitted. Shiva received negative reviews; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com wrote that the film \\"dare[d] to ridiculously rest on the incapable shoulders of a non-acting cast\\", and nastiness was \\"defined as a scowling ogre\\". Director Riingo Banerjee acknowledged Siva as a source of inspiration for his 2006 Bengali film Kranti.  Sequel  In September Nagarjuna said that a sequel to Siva would be a viable alternative to a digitised version, and proposed a film about Siva, Asha, and their two sons. Advising Varma to develop a script, he asked the director to cast Amala, Naga Chaitanya and Akhil Akkineni. The sequel would reportedly be produced by Annapurna Studios.  Aftermath   Digitisation  In September 2014, Siva was digitally remastered for theatrical release. Supriya Yarlagadda of Annapurna Studios said that the decision to remaster and digitise was made after observing the challenges in storing and preserving old film prints. The process (carried out in Mumbai) took a year, and the film's colour and sound quality were enhanced to meet current standards. A silver jubilee event was held on 7 October 2014 in Hyderabad, where Nagarjuna announced that Siva digitised version would be released on 17 October 2014 on nearly 100 screens. In April 2015, Varma told Indo-Asian News Service that the digitised release was postponed until 15 May because of restoration delays.  Documentary  During the digitisation of Shiva, Varma said that he would release a documentary on the making of the film entitled Exploring Shiva after 25 Years. The first documentary based on a Telugu film, it provided a \\"holistic view of the film\\" and featured interviews with the cast and crew and segments on its sound and filming locations. The documentary was released on 5 October 2014, coinciding with Siva silver anniversary.  Legacy   Influence on film personalities  Siva, which attained cult status in Telugu cinema, is one of the first Telugu films produced after the migration of Telugu film industry from Madras to Hyderabad to feature characters speaking the Telangana dialect. The film made Nagarjuna a superstar in Telugu cinema; it changed his career, and earned him a reputation for encouraging new directors. Nagarjuna considered Siva a milestone in his personal life as well since he and Amala, who were in a relationship during the film's shoot, decided to marry after its completion. According to filmmaker V. V. Vinayak and writer Pulagam Chinnarayana, Siva divided Telugu cinema into two eras: before and after the film. With Siva, Varma was credited with the introduction of steadicams and new sound recording techniques in Telugu films. Within a year of the film's release, more than ten steadicams were imported into India. Siva attracted the young audience during its theatrical run, and its success encouraged filmmakers to explore a variety of themes and make experimental Telugu films. Bharani broke through as an actor and dialogue writer with the film. Chakravarthy, Jithendra and Ramjagan achieved success with Siva, and the former two adapted J. D. and Chinna as screen names. Kannada actor and filmmaker Upendra reworked the narrative of Om (1995) when he found the previous version similar to Siva. Telugu filmmaker S. S. Rajamouli understood the importance of heightening tension in action sequences, and the impact created by proper use of sound after watching Siva. Srinu Vaitla, Sudheer Varma, and Praveen Sri were inspired by Siva to pursue careers as directors; Sri assisted Ram Gopal Varma before he made his directorial debut with Gaayam 2 (2010). Music director Munna Kasi was inspired by Ilaiyaraaja's work in Siva, and wanted to work with Varma after he graduated. On the rise of antisocial-element-based scripts in Tamil cinema, trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai said in May 2002 that Siva Tamil-dubbed version (Udhayam) was the \\"forerunner\\" of city-based crime films. Tamil actor Ganesh Venkatraman was \\"mesmerised\\" as a child by Siva, admiring Nagarjuna and carrying a cycle chain in his schoolbag. About the impact of Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) on Indian cinema, Rana Daggubati said that regional films can gain national acceptance for their content and cited the success of Siva and Roja (1992) as examples. In March 2016, Karthi said that he admired Nagarjuna after seeing Siva and Idhayathai Thirudathe (1989) and found working with him in Oopiri (2016) \\"a great chance to know him.\\"  In popular culture  The cycle- chain scene became popular, with people telling Varma that they broke a cycle chain after seeing Siva; the director called them the \\"ultimate example of how imagination can take over and become a reality in time\\". As of 2014, the chain used in the film is owned by Chakravarthy. Film-poster designers Anil and Bhanu said that posters should be designed to make a subconscious impact on the viewer, citing the title logo of Siva (with Nagarjuna and the cycle chain) as an example. Inspired by Varma's work in Siva, Rajamouli composed the action sequence during the intermission of his directorial debut Student No. 1 (2002), and followed the shot division of the cycle-chain scene for the same. Chakravarthy agreed to play the antagonist in Naga Chaitanya's acting debut, Josh (2009), and said that its makers are \\"trying to get JD of Shiva who actually ran away mid way from college\\". Bangalore Mirror and other reviewers noted similarities between Josh and Siva, which Chaitanya called a \\"coincidence\\". Chaitanya's films, Bezawada (2011)‚Äîproduced by Varma‚Äîand Autonagar Surya (2014), were noted for similarities to Siva. Siva was parodied in several films such as Lakshmi (2006), Oosaravelli (2011), Katha Screenplay Darsakatvam Appalaraju (2011) (also directed by Varma), and Sudigadu (2012). Amala listed Siva with Pushpaka Vimana (1987), Vedham Pudhithu (1987), Agni Natchathiram (1988), and Karpoora Mullai (1991) as her most memorable films. Geethika Chandrahasan Sudip of The Hindu listed Siva for the letter S in the July 2015 \\"ABCD of Telugu cinema\\". In August 2015, Pooja Darade of The Times of India included the film on her list of \\"Telugu movies one must watch before dying\\". Fahad Usmani of The Hindu compared Siva to Mother India (1957), Sholay (1975), Mr. India (1987), Agneepath (1990), and Ghayal (1990), noting that their antagonists became more popular than their heroes.

He is then thrown into the conflict between a quasi-governmental organization known as the GHQ and a resistance group called Funeral Parlor which aims to restore Japan's independence from the GHQ. In the process, Shu has to deal with the burden his ability puts on his shoulders and the horrific mystery of his past. Main Shu Ouma : is the 17-year-old protagonist of Guilty Crown. A socially inept person, Shu is a second year high school student and a member of the school's modern image and video research club. His stepmother, Haruka, works for Sephirah Genomics, while his father, Kurosu, an expert on the Apocalypse Virus, is killed during the \\"Lost Christmas\\" incident. Shu's involvement in the series begins when he meets Inori Yuzuriha. After Inori is apprehended by the GHQ Anti-Bodies, Shu decides to make amends for not helping her earlier by delivering an item called \\"Void Genome\\" she was transporting to the leader of Funeral Parlor, Gai Tsutsugami. However upon arrival, a battle between the GHQ and Funeral Parlor has begun, forcing Shu to escape while protecting the Void Genome. It is then when he rescues Inori and protects her from a GHQ Endlave that the \\"Void Genome\\" fuses onto his right arm, granting him the \\"Power of the King\\", which allows him to extract items from a person's heart. After that incident, Gai suggests that Shu join Funeral Parlor, but Shu turns down the offer. However, when his classmate, Yahiro Samukawa, sells him out to the GHQ, Shu joins the organization. Despite joining them, Shu stays with Funeral Parlor due to Inori, who he has feelings for, but he resents Gai, who he at first believe was Inori's lover, due to the fact Gai used his feelings for Inori to make him join Funeral Parlor and Gai is everything that he is not; smart, popular and well respected. But upon seeing the real Gai; a man conflicted to play a ruthless tactical genius and leader, earning Shu's respect for Gai and Funeral Parlor. After getting his name clear from the GHQ, Shu returns to school with a more open, sociable attitude much to his friends' notice. At the same time, Inori begins living with him and their feelings for each other grow as he starts getting flashback of forgotten memories. While still attending school, he continues helping Funeral Parlor in their missions. But his new attitude doesn't last long after Shu fails to save Yahiro's brother Jun as he was forced to kill him to save Yahiro's life. Traumatized on what he has done, Shu refuses to join Gai in an important mission to retrieve the meteorite where the Apocalypse Virus originated before it is transported out of Japan. When his friend Hare slaps some sense into him and learns the Anti-Bodies have launched a coup d'√©tat against the GHQ upper echelons by starting a second Apocalypse outbreak in Tokyo, stole the meteorite and decimate Funeral Parlor, Shu breaks out of his self-pity and decides to rescue Inori and his Funeral Parlor allies. With the help of his friends from school, Shu goes to rescue Inori and Gai from the GHQ and Anti-Bodies and faces the leader of the Anti-Bodies, Shuichiro Keido. Encountering Yu, a boy working with Keido who also possess \\"Power of the King\\", Shu finally remembers his forgotten memories. It is revealed Gai was Shu's childhood friend, nicknamed Triton whom his older sister Mana rescued ten years ago. Gai looked up to Shu as he was a brave boy back then. Unknown to Shu or Gai, his sister was the first person to be infected by the Apocalypse Virus, which slowly drives her insane, even causing her to develop feelings for her brother. Gai, who knew the truth, tried to reveal this to Shu on the Christmas Eve of 2029. However, Mana found out about it and tricked Gai into shooting himself. Shu then stumbles upon the scene and is asked by Mana to marry her so that they 'can start a new race together.' Shu, disturbed and shocked, rejects her offer, calling her a 'monster.' Hurt at his remark Mana went berserk, causing the virus to take over her body and spread it all over Tokyo, thus beginning the \\"Lost Christmas\\" incident. Traumatized, Shu repressed these memories. With his memories regained, Shu rescues Inori from Keido's clutches in his plans to transplant Mana's soul into her body so he and Mana will spread the outbreak worldwide and start a new race. However, he is forced to kill Gai so that his weapon could break the pod containing his sister's soul, freeing her and ending the outbreak. After the outbreak, Shu, Inori and their Funeral Parlor friends Ayase and Tsugumi stays at Tennouzu High after the school is converted into a refugee center. However, the area their school is located is barricaded and lock downed by the Anti-Bodies who proceed to exterminate the civilians inside. Due to uncertainty and despair, Shu replaces Arisa Kuhouin as the student council president after regaining control of a chaotic school assembly. After becoming student council president, he rules the school with dignity and respect and refuses Yahiro's suggestion to implement a Void- ranking system which determines how much vaccine and care someone receives, believing that it will lead to discrimination between the students. However, when Hare is killed during an attempt by Souta to find vaccines from a nearby hospital, Shu falls into despair and implements the ranking system. After the successful take down of the Tokyo Tower and the Ghost Team, Shu was betrayed by Arisa Kuhouin and his fellow students. The resurrected Gai then appears and slices off Shu's right arm, transferring the \\"Power of the King\\" from Shu to Gai. Subsequently, Shu slipped into a bout of extreme depression, horrified at his own actions. When Inori sacrificed herself to protect Shu, he came to terms with his actions, and became determined to save her. He then took Arisa hostage in order to have her lead him to Inori. While driving, he gets news that Haruka is on the run, and possesses the third Void Genome. Arisa takes him to the building where she, the remaining members of Funeral Parlor, and Shu's friends are hiding. Shu arrives shortly after Segai begins an assault to take the Void Genome for himself. Before Ayase attempts to use the Void Genome on herself at great risk, Shu finds it and injects himself with it. With Power of King returned to him, Shu pulls out his own Void, which manifests as a new right arm made entirely of Apocalypse crystal, replacing the one Gai severed. With their permission, he uses Ayase's, Souta's, and Yahiro's Voids, now memorized by his Void, to save them from Segai. The battle culminates in him using Yahiro's Void shears to sever Segai's life. Despite his new-found abilities, as a side-effect, Shu is infected with the Apocalypse virus while retrieving Souta's Void - immediately curing the terminal Souta. Shu makes the decision to use Power of the King to save Inori and stop Gai. Shu acquired his powers from the \\"Void Genome\\". His power is to extract \\"Voids\\", genetic physical objects formed of the personality of anyone younger than 17. After regaining his lost memories, his powers evolved, allowing him to extract Voids from people while they still retained consciousness. He briefly lost his powers when Gai stole it, but regained them upon injecting himself with another \\"Void Genome\\". His Void can absorb other Voids into his own, allowing him to use its powers indefinitely. It manifests itself as an arm made entirely of Apocalypse Crystal, replacing the arm Gai severed off when he stole his powers. His void is a double-edged sword, however, as he also takes any adverse effects that the Void user has, such as the Apocalypse Cancer, and if by any reason Shu dies, all owners of the voids he obtained should perish as well. After defeating Gai, Shu tries to take all the Apocalypse Virus into himself, but Inori takes it instead, sacrificing herself. Sometime later, Shu is seen celebrating Hare's birthday with the others, and is presumably blind (he uses a white cane). He has a prosthetic limb and no longer has the Apocalypse Virus. Inori Yuzuriha : is the main heroine of Guilty Crown, and the stoic 17-year-old vocalist of the group Egoist. She is also a member of the \\"Funeral Parlor\\" resistance group and her Void is a sword. She becomes Shu's partner and as the series progresses, begins to show different types of emotions, eventually falling in love with him. She's later revealed to be created by Da'ath to become the vessel of Mana, and in episode 12, she was captured to complete Mana's rebirth, but was then saved by Shu. Afterwards, however, she starts expressing more erratic behavior, cumulating with her killing two other students and stabbing Arisa through the hand. She is later captured by the resurrected Gai and Da'ath as she tries to protect Shu. Inori's Void is a heavy sword that resembles a bisento, which can be combined with other Voids for different effects. When extracted by Yu, it takes a more wing-like shape. In Episode 18, she also demonstrates the ability to turn into a \\"monster\\" mode, where a pair of blades extend from her arms and she gains increased strength and speed. In episode 21 Inori is consumed and reborn as Mana. In the final episode, when Shu tries to take in all of the Apocalypse Virus into himself, Inori takes it instead, sacrificing herself so that Shu can live on, even so her soul lives within Shu as observed when both embrace at the end of the episode. Gai Tsutsugami : is the 23-year-old resourceful and charismatic leader of the \\"Funeral Parlor\\" resistance group. He hopes to push the revolution to success with the help of Shu's \\"Power of the King\\". A charming and yet manipulative man, he leads Funeral Parlor as a fearless leader who expects the best, without disappointment, from his subordinates. At the beginning of the series, he tasks Inori to steal the Void Genome so he can use its power. However, a battle between the Anti-Bodies and Funeral Parlor leads to Shu gaining that power instead. Nevertheless, he tries to make Shu join his organization, and succeeds after using his feelings for Inori, and after he was arrested by the GHQ. Shu at first holds animosity toward Gai for manipulating him into joining Funeral Parlor (not making things any better is that Inori is rumored to be Gai's lover as well) and he is everything Shu is not; smart, popular and well respected. But upon seeing the real Gai; a man conflicted to play a ruthless tactical genius and leader, Shu gains a new respect for Gai and helps him in their missions. But after Shu refuses to join them for an important mission after being traumatized over killing Yahiro's brother, Gai abandons him to continue the mission; steal the meteorite that originated the Apocalypse Virus from the GHQ. However, the mission fails when Keido and the Anti-Bodies start a second Apocalypse outbreak over Tokyo and proceeds to eliminate both the upper echelons of GHQ and Funeral Parlor. While Gai and several members survive, Gai's Apocalypse infection starts to reemerge. A determined Shu arrives to save him from the Anti-Bodies, and he joins Shu to rescue Inori from the clutches of Keido. Gai later reveals to Shu that he is in fact his childhood friend \\"Triton\\". Ten years ago, he was saved by Shu and Mana from drowning at a shore. Nicknamed \\"Triton\\" by Mana, Gai and the Ouma siblings became close friends and spent a summer together. During this time, he admired Shu for his confidence, and fell in love with Mana for saving him. He eventually discovers Mana's insanity and tries to warn Shu about it, but is tricked by Mana into shooting himself in a church. After the Lost Christmas incident, he leaves to make himself stronger, eventually becoming the leader of Funeral Parlor. After helping Shu rescue Inori, Gai goes to free Mana's soul from the pod containing it. However, the crystals protecting the pod stab him. Close to death and pinned to Mana's pod, Gai requests that Shu stab him through the heart in order to break the pod and free Mana's soul. He seemingly dies embracing Mana, finally reunited with his lost love. At the end of episode 16, Gai is resurrected by Shuichiro Keido and Haruka Ouma. He then reappears in episode 17, cutting off Shu's right arm with Inori's void, transferring the \\"Power of the King\\" from Shu's severed arm to himself. He becomes one of the story's main antagonists as he proceeds to aid Da'ath's plans to resurrect Mana, showing utter disregard for human lives in the process. However, after being defeated by Shu in the series' climactic final battle, he reveals his true goal was to free Mana from her cursed role as Eve so she could finally rest in peace. While admitting he also accepted the role of \\"the King\\" out of fear of being excluded from Da'ath's new humanity, he reveals he always secretly believed Shu would stop them in the end. He is last seen - presumably in Shu's mind - embracing Mana and dying with her, this time for good. Gai has the ability to see people's Voids due to being infected with the Apocalypse Virus. To prevent the virus from crystallizing his body, he undergoes blood transfusions with Inori, as her blood can fight off the infection. To prevent anyone in Funeral Parlor from knowing, he has Inori visit his room during their blood transfusions, fooling everyone into believing that he and Inori are lovers. His Void is a gun that forces out other people's Voids, though it can also be used as a regular gun. Funeral Parlor Ayase Shinomiya : is a paraplegic Endlave pilot who uses a wheelchair. She had feelings for Gai and was very loyal to him before returning as an antagonist in episode 17. Finally, she develops feelings for Shu from episode 12. Previously, she piloted an older Endlave Jumeau model before it was destroyed by Daryl but later gains Daryl's Endlave Steiner model. Her Void is a special pair of leg braces that allow her to rapidly skate over ground, jump with immense power and even fly. In the epilogue, it seems like she is the one looking after Shu and in daily contact with him. Tsugumi : is a 14-year-old hacker who is in charge of information warfare. Her codename is \\"Black Swan\\" and her main site of operations is a holographic sphere where she uses her whole body as interface thanks to a special sensor suit. She also controls Funell when doing tasks Shu and Inori cannot do. Her Void is a Hand Scanner, a magical girl wand that can create holographic projections of people. Argo Tsukishima : is a 17-year-old member who is skilled in hand-to-hand combat and the use of knives. His Void is a torchlight that temporarily blinds its target in a sphere of complete darkness. He is a second-year student at Ryusen High School. Oogumo : is a large, quiet man who specializes in firearms and explosives. He was injured while protecting Haruka, and later killed by Segai. Shibungi : is a 27-year-old man who is Gai's second-in-command. He is known for saying: \\"As expected of Gai\\". Kenji Kido : is a mass murderer and infamous terrorist responsible for the \\"Sky Tree Bombing\\". He was previously held at GHQ Isolation Facility Four before being rescued by Shu and the Funeral Parlor. His Void is a Gravity gun. He is a skilled hacker much like Tsugumi. He is shot by Shinbungi during the final battle when he figures out that Kenji is aligned with Gai and is preventing Tsugumi from hacking into the GHQ headquarters (as only Kenji is capable of hacking as well as Tsugumi). Funell is Inori's pet robot who also acts as her guardian. It expresses a lot of emotions even though it is mechanical. Funell is capable of shooting out strings very much like a Tachikoma. Its name is a play on the English word \\"Funeral\\". Tennouzu High School ; : :Shu's classmate and member of the motion picture research club. Yahiro is one of Shu's close friends who bothers to socialize with him. Despite being seen as nice person, secretly he is a drug dealer by the name of \\"Sugar\\" and his image at school is actually a facade to hide his real anger. The reason he deals drugs is to pay for his little brother's medical bills. His Void is a pair of large shears that are said to sever life, this is because deep down he feels his ill brother burdens him. After the school is quarantined and Shu becomes president of the student council, Yahiro becomes his right hand man. He does several things to \\"ensure the school's safety,\\" such as hide the fact that the destruction of a Void causes its owner to die. When Hare dies due to her Void being destroyed, he tells Shu it was because she was killed by a new genomic weapon, so that Shu wouldn't be afraid to utilize the power of the students' Voids to ensure their safety. ; : :Shu's classmate and another member of the motion picture research club. He is a big fan of Inori. His Void is a camera-like gun capable of opening anything from doors to electronic safes. His void is among the weakest in the school, which leads him to carelessly embark on a mission to retrieve vaccines with other low-ranking students drawing attention to the GHQ and resulting in Hare's death, and Shu becoming a ruthless leader. Infected with the Apocalipse Virus, Souta is forced to work on hazardous condition according to Yahiro's plan, and ends up against Shu when he was betrayed by the other students. However, he entered the terminal stage of the disease until Shu made use of his void to absorb his power as well as the virus in his body, curing Souta by infecting himself in the process. Before the final battle, he and Shu make up, promising they'll always be friends, and is seen in the epilogue celebrating Hare's birthday. ; : :Shu's classmate and close friend who has a crush on him. Her void is a bandage roll that can heal injuries and instantly repair damaged objects. Drawn into an attack in the fifteenth episode, she is ordered by Souta to repair a car - which explodes, mortally injuring her and Shu. Waking up, Hare uses her Void to heal Shu, but her Void is shot and destroyed, essentially killing Hare. Shu wakes up and hold her in his arms, only for her body to start crystallizing, and she shatters before his eyes. ; : :The chairman of Class 2-A and Hare's friend who knows about her feelings for Shu and usually helps her to get close to him. Her void is a visor that can see and locate things from afar. She has feelings for Yahiro. She joins the others and helps Shu when they decide to stop Gai. ; : :The student council president. Her grandfather is the head of the Kuhouin Group which is at odds with the GHQ, and Arisa is his heir. She however doesn't want the responsibilities associated with it, but is unable to face it, resulting in her Void being named \\"The Coward's Shield\\", which is a disc-shaped shield controlled by a ball-shaped device. The shield can divide itself in 6 parts, and even grow in size. Arisa developed a crush on Gai when they met while he was asking her grandfather to help fund Funeral Parlor. :After the 2nd Apocalypse Outbreak, she takes leadership of Tennouzu High after the school is turn in a refugee center for teenagers. But after the government seals off the area where Tennouzu High is also located, the students begin to lose confidence in her despite assuring them her grandfather's men will rescue them. She loses her position of student council president after the students vote Shu as their new president but still continues to help the student council. :Arisa learns to truth that people die when their voids are destroyed but is attacked by Inori to keep her silent. Traumatized from the attack, Arisa receives a phone call from Gai who encourages her to attempt a coup d'√©tat to overthrow Shu. To achieve this she seduces Hirohide Nanba to spread rumors about the truth of voids in order to further destroy their faith in him. Once Shu successfully leads the students out of quarantine zone, she and the students turn on him. :Arisa follows Gai when he takes control, despite initially having some doubts. When her grandfather, Okina, decides to kill her for shaming the Kuhouin family, she shoots and kills him. She follows Gai to the final battle, holding back the UN forces with her shield, and is alive seen being outside of the falling GHQ. GHQ ; : :The former Commander-in- Chief of the GHQ. General Yan is in charge of the GHQ forces in Japan, except for the Anti-Bodies, led by Keido. He is the father of Daryl Yan, but does not like his son, believing Daryl may not be his biological son.

He is also the estranged older brother of Shu's stepmother, Haruka Ouma. As GHQ's leading scientific expert on the Apocalypse Virus, Keido's purported goal is to eradicate the epidemic by systematically isolating and exterminating infected members of the Japanese population. This proves to be a pretext for his true goal of causing a worldwide outbreak and lay the foundation for a new human race. Towards the middle of the series, Keido puts his plans into motion by launching a coup against GHQ's commanding officer, Major General Yan, and unleashing the Virus across Japan once again. :In his past, Shuichiro Keido was an academic colleague and friend of Shu's late father, Kurosu Ohma. However, his respect towards Kurosu increasingly morphed into hatred as he witnessed the latter's success eclipse his own. During the events of Lost Christmas, Keido murdered his erstwhile friend in a fit of rage upon realizing his brilliance had risen to a level he could never hope to reach. From that moment forward, Keido became a man consumed by hatred and vengeance. Towards that end, he cooperates with the secret society, Da'ath, to unleash the Apocalypse Virus and destroy the world Kurosu tried to save. After his plans are ultimately foiled by Shu and Funeral Parlor, he commits suicide by injecting himself with the Virus, cryptically noting neither he nor Kurosu \\"won\\" in the end. ; : :A 2nd Lieutenant Juvenile Officer and General Yan's son.

He's for the most part calm, and remains like that even if he's in dangerous situations. He seems to enjoy his work like a game, although he does take his job seriously. As Keido's second-in-command, he and the Anti-Bodies free Keido from his house arrest by causing another Apocalypse Virus outbreak. After Keido gave Major Segai the information he wanted, and declared his role in the coup d'√©tat over, Major Segai helps Gai, Ayase and Haruka locate where Keido was. After the events of the 2nd Apocalypse Virus outbreak, Major Sagai becomes the new leader of the Anti-Bodies. Major Sagai also becomes interested in the Void Genome and decides to gain it for himself to embrace the Void's light.

A former football coach, he is an upbeat man who gives pep talks to his subordinates and uses the word \\"Guts\\" a lot. He is also very irresponsible and tends to work with low, if any, efficiency, using a vast amount of resources for rather simple tasks, or use resources in the most absurd way possible, such as turning Anti-Air Missile Vehicles sideways so they can be launched straight rather than upwards. He was killed by Major Segai during Keido's coup d'√©tat while saving Haruka. ; : :A mysterious blond boy who is an acquaintance of Keido. During Keido's coup d'√©tat and the second Apocalypse Virus outbreak, Yu is revealed to also possess \\"Power of the King\\" when he kidnaps Inori and uses her Void to kill Shu, only for Gai to save him. Gai recognizes him by the title \\"Grave Keeper of Da'ath\\". Yu eventually reveals himself as a member of Da'ath, a powerful secret society strongly implied to be the prime mover behind the Apocalypse Virus outbreak. Others ; : :Yahiro's younger brother. He had been affected with the Apocalypse Virus, which led Yahiro to become a drug dealer so that he could get treatment for the virus from the GHQ. Jun is killed by Yahiro's Void after begging Shu to kill him, as he does not want to die hating Yahiro or to burden his elder brother any longer. ; : :Arisa's grandfather and head of the Kuhouin Group, the richest and most powerful conglomerate in Japan. Okina despises the GHQ for not only taking away Japan's independence but also their restrictive policies affecting his various businesses. Sharing a common enemy, Okina agrees to supply Gai and Funeral Parlor with funds and weapons. After the 2nd Apocalypse outbreak, he rescues Argo and Ogumo and tasks them to rescue his granddaughter after Loop 7 is quarantined by the GHQ. However, the mission fails and much to his dismay, Arisa joins the GHQ Anti-Bodies due to her unrequited love for Gai. For dishonoring their family name, he and his men ambushed her convoy where he plans to kill her himself. However, he is hesitant to kill her, and Arisa kills her grandfather in self-defense. ; : :Okina's secretary. Kurachi is well informed on the events on what's happening between the GHQ and its enemies. After Okina death, she leads on what's left of the Kuhouin Group. She is also an old friend of Haruka. ; : :Shu's late father. He was an expert on the Apocalypse Virus who died during Lost Christmas. It was later revealed that Keido killed him out of hatred. ; : :A pink-haired girl who has a mysterious connection with Shu, Gai, and Inori. She is ultimately revealed to be Shu's older sister. Ten years prior to the start of the series, Shu and Mana rescued a young Gai, whom Mana nicknamed Triton. The three of them became close friends, spending the summer together. However, unknown to anyone else, Mana was the first person to become infected with the Apocalypse Virus, which gradually caused her to become mentally unstable, even causing her to have feelings for Shu, unaware that she was his sister. Gai discovered this and tried to warn Shu, but Mana showed up at their meeting and tricked Gai into shooting himself. When Shu arrived, Mana proposed to Shu, stating that they could \\"start a new race together\\". Shocked and disturbed at the scene, Shu rejected her offer, calling her \\"a monster\\". Heartbroken, Mana went berserk, causing the virus to mutate and spread all over Tokyo, causing the Lost Christmas. Mana's body was eventually destroyed by the virus. This event affected Shu and Gai deeply, and the two split just after the incident, with Gai vowing to 'become stronger.' It is also at that time that Shu, traumatized, repressed his memories of Gai and Mana. :During the second Apocalypse outbreak and Keido's coup d'√©tat, Keido manages to capture Mana's soul, still under the influence of the virus, and tries to resurrect her using Inori's body. However, his attempts are foiled by Shu and Gai. To free Mana's soul and be with her in her last moments, a dying Gai sacrifices himself to allow Shu to stab the crystal pod containing Mana's soul through his body, finally freeing Mana's soul from the virus. However, this is revealed to be false, as Mana's soul has already entered Inori's body and begins to take over, as seen by Inori's psychotic behaviour. In episode 21, Mana fully takes control of Inori's body and begin to spread the Apocalypse virus throughout the world. However, a fragment of Inori's soul remains and helps Shu and his friends stop the spread of the Apocalypse virus. She's last seen, presumably in Shu's mind, embraced by Gai, finally able to be free from her role as Eve and dies with him. Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas ; : :The protagonist.

Two .50 caliber machine guns were fitted, along with two rigid hull Customs Rescue Tenders.  Operational history  The ship was laid down at the Aker Yards ASA in Tulcea, Romania on 25 August 2006 as a ROV support vessel for Norwegian shipping company DOF Subsea. Based on the Aker ROV 06 DE design, it was named Geo Bergen during construction and launched on 28 January 2007. The ship was renamed to Skandi Bergen on 19 July 2007 prior to its completion on 3 August 2007. In mid-2010, the Australian government chartered the ship for the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, as a replacement for MV Oceanic Viking. The ship was chartered to Customs through DMAA Seaforce. Modifications for Customs service were made by Forgacs Engineering in Newcastle, New South Wales, including the installation of the austere accommodation and medical deckhouse (the latter staffed by a doctor drawn from the Australian Antarctic Division), fitting of weapons and davits for the two Customs tenders, modification and expansion of crew recreation facilities, and sealing of the ship's moon pools. On completion, the ship was renamed and redesignated \\"Australian Customs Vessel (ACV) Ocean Protector\\". Ocean Protector entered Customs Service in October 2010. During November 2010, the vessel intercepted suspected drug smugglers off Queensland, and intercepted two asylum seeker boats off Christmas Island in November 2010. In January 2012, Ocean Protector retrieved three Australian anti-whaling activists who had boarded MV Sh≈çnan Maru 2. In November 2015, DOF announced the sale of the vessel to the Australian government for NOK 300 million, with the ship to be handed over in early 2016.

RS 44) was a manual cipher system, used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. The cipher was designed by the astronomer and sometime cryptographer Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Walter Fricke while working as a conscript in Section IIb, of Group 2 of OKW/Chi and introduced in March 1944 and the Allied forces codebreakers had considerable difficulties in breaking it. Cryptanalysis, if successful, generally required a 40 letter crib (known plaintext) and some two weeks, making the tactical information outdated before it could be exploited. The combination of strength and ease of use made RS 44 an ideal hand cipher.  Design  The cipher is a transposition based grille cipher, consisting of a grid with 25 columns and 24 rows. Each row contains 10 randomly placed white cells (to be filled with text) and 15 black cells. The columns are labeled with shuffled digraphs and numbers and the rows with digraphs. The key sheet also contains two letter substitution alphabets to encode place names, prior to encryption, and a letter conversion alphabet to encode digraphs. The text is written in the grid, starting from a randomly chosen position, row by row, from left to right. The ciphertext is taken column by column, following the numbering of the columns. The first column to be taken is calculated from the minutes of the message time, the letter count of the message text and the randomly chosen column of the start cell. The message key contains the start position of the text in the grid, designated by the column and header digraphs. The digraphs for the message key are encoded with the letter conversion table and then included in the message header. The secret variable start cell and first column ensure a unique transposition for each message, making multiple anagramming very difficult.

It is regarded by many as the second unofficial anthem of Tyneside after Blaydon Races. This now famous local piece pokes fun at one of the many (at the time) whitening-stone sellers. The stone, made of baked clay (or \\"yella clay\\") was used to clean and decorate the stone steps leading up to the front door of the many terrace houses in the area (The material, or similar, was in common use throughout the country). Ridley had to leave the area for a while when the song initially caused consternation with the real live stone sellers. It is apparently the last song written by him. The song was featured, along with a number of other Geordie folk songs of yesteryear, in \\"Geordie The Musical\\" which premiered at the Customs House in North Shields in 2015 and was recommissioned in 2017 at the Tyne Theatre & Opera House as part of their 150-year anniversary celebrations.  Lyrics  The song was first published in 1862 by Thomas Allan in his book of a collection of Tyneside songs. The music was by Harry Clifton (1832‚Äì1872) originally composed and performed by him as \\"Pretty Polly Perkins of Paddington Green\\", though possibly not published in the original version until a year or two after the words to \\"Cushey Butterfield\\" had appeared in print.

He was the captain of the convoy ships Leopold I and Wapen von Hamburg, which defended merchant ships from the pirates of the North African Barbary Coast. Career Stained glass window, destroyed in WWII, from the Hamburg town hall featuring Karpfanger Karpfanger was born in Hamburg in 1623 into a seafaring family with Dutch roots. He inherited a fleet of ships from his father, captaining these and scoring significant successes in fighting piracy. His fleet of ships expanded as he commandeered the ships he captured. In 1674, he rose to the rank of admiral, becoming a Convoykapit√§n. This title was given to those captains of warships who escorted merchant ships along the traderoutes of the Hanseatic League. Karpfanger first took command of the ship Leopoldus Primus, later called Leopold I, and later on Wapen von Hamburg, which launched in 1669. Commissioned in 1668 to protect the merchant ships from the Barbary corsairs, the Wapen was a long warship with a total of 54 cannons, ranging from four to 18 pounds. Karpfanger took command of this ship in 1683, when Leopold I was being repaired. Karfanger was with the ship on 10 October 1683. On that day, while the ship was in the port of Cadiz, a fire started in the bow of the frigate that spread quickly throughout the rest of the ship. The crew tried desperately to fight the fire and when they could not contain it attempted to abandon ship on sloops. Karpfanger himself refused to abandon the ship while efforts continued to save it and commanded the crew to return to further fight the fire. Around midnight, the fire reached the ship's gunpowder magazine, causing the ship to explode. Admiral Karfanger was among the dead, alongside 22 soldiers and 42 crewmen. His body was found floating on the mooring line of an English ship in the harbour the next morning. The cause of the fire was never discovered. Legacy Karpfanger was buried with honor at the cemetery in Cadiz, with a monument ordered at his tomb in his honor by Charles II of Spain. In 1808 the French moved the cemetery to make room to expand the fortress. In 1897 Hamburg honoured Karpfanger with a monument designed by R Okelmann. In 1937 the Hamburg America Line bought the barque l'Avenir and renamed it Admiral Karpfanger in his honour. Notes Additional sources * Ernst Baasch: Hamburgs Convoyschiffahrt und Convoywesen.

It was launched as a clandestine weekly newspaper in July 1974, as the Central Committee of the Ethiopian People's Liberation Organization (as the EPRP was known at the time) returned to Ethiopia from exile.Tiruneh, Andargachew.

Ethiopia: The Political Economy of Transition. Lanham, Md. [u.a.]: Univ. Press of America, 1995. p. 120 Overview Democracia quickly acquired a significant readership in the student and trade union movements. Along with its sister publication Abyot (which had become associated with EPRP), Democracia played an important role in defining the Ethiopian revolution;Uhlig, Siegbert. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica 2 D- Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2005. pp. 432‚Äì433 at one point Democracia had a larger readership than the government publications.Selassie, Bereket Habte.

New York [u.a.]: Monthly Review Press, 1980. p. 44 According to Markakis and Waller, Democracia \\"became the most avidly read publication in Ethiopia's history\\".Markakis, John, and Michael Waller. Military Marxist Regimes in Africa. London, England: F. Cass, 1986. p. 32 But the publication was also subjected to repression. During the early phase of the revolution, possession of a copy of Democracia could lead to imprisonment, torture or execution.Taye Assefa. Academic Freedom in Ethiopia: Perspectives of Teaching Personnel. Addis Ababa: Forum for Social Studies, 2008. p. 41 On the other hand, the fact that EPRP was able to print Democracia in the capital Addis Ababa in spite of tight control by the security forces has led to speculations that the party might have had sympathizers within the police ranks.Legum, Colin. Africa Contemporary Record: Annual Survey and Documents. New York: Africana Pub. Co, 1979. p. B-219 Democracia labelled the political rhetoric of the Derg military junta as vague, in reference to its discourses of hibretesebawenet (egalitarian socialism) and itiyopia tikdem (\\"Ethiopia First\\").Mammo, Tirfe. The Paradox of Africa's Poverty: The Role of Indigenous Knowledge, Traditional Practices and Local Institutions: the Case of Ethiopia. Lawrenceville, NJ [u.a.]: Red Sea Press, 1999. pp. 114, 136 Key demands raised in Democracia included democratic rights for the masses, freedom to organize associations, and the transfer of power from the Derg to a provisional popular government. Democracia pressured the Derg to suspend the imperial constitution, depose the Emperor, nationalize industries and banks, disband the old spying networks and imprison aristocrats of the old imperial regime. Democracia labelled the moves taken by the Derg in this direction to be insufficient and superficial. The only positive commentaries raised by Democracia towards the Derg junta concerned its land reform programme. However, Democracia considered that the Derg reform did not enable people to take direct control under a worker's government, but allowed the transfer of lands to bureaucratic capitalists.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution 1974‚Äì1987 : a Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian. Cambridge: University of Cambridge, 1995. p. 101 By late 1975, the feud between the EPRP and its main adversary on the left (the All- Ethiopian Socialist Movement or Meison) became public, and attacks on Meison frequently appeared in Democracia.Tiruneh, Andargachew. The Ethiopian Revolution 1974‚Äì1987 : a Transformation from an Aristocratic to a Totalitarian.

It was built in the late thirteenth century by the Bagod (later called Baggot) family, for whom it was named. During the English Civil War, possession of the castle, which was described as \\"the strongest fortress near Dublin\\", was a matter of great importance to both sides in the conflict, and it was largely destroyed during the Siege of Dublin in 1649, on the eve of the Battle of Rathmines. The ruins of the castle remained on the site until the early nineteenth century when Dublin Corporation demolished what was left of it. No trace of it survives today, but it probably stood at the present-day 44-46 Upper Baggot Street, facing Waterloo Road.Ball, F. Elrington History of Dublin 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2 p.42 Baggotsrath Castle in 1792 Early history The castle and the surrounding district took their name fro the Bagod family, founded by Sir Robert Bagod, the Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, who purchased the lands about 1280 and built the castle. From the Bagods, ownership of the castle passed to the Fitzwilliam family, who later held the title Viscount Fitzwilliam. It came into the possession of the influential English-born soldier and statesman Sir Edward Perrers in the early 15th century but later reverted to the Fitzwilliam family.Ball pp.43-45 The castle was the scene of violent conflict in 1441. Sir Edward Perrers' widow Joanna, to whom the castle had passed on their only son's death in 1428, died having appointed James Cornwalsh, the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, as her executor. Cornwalsh took possession of the castle, a move which was greatly resented by Sir Edward Perrers' daughter Ismay who had married into the Fitzwilliam family. Her husband raised a substantial troop of soldiers, attacked the castle, and according to the charges \\"feloniously murdered\\" the judge.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 The charge of murder makes it difficult to explain why Fitzwilliam and Ismay were soon pardoned, although the Government of Henry VI was notoriously willing to issue pardons, even for the most serious of crimes.Ross, Charles Edward IV Eyre Methuen Ltd. 1974 The castle was described as being in a ruinous condition in 1489 but was later rebuilt, and by the 1640s was said to be the strongest fortress near Dublin,Ball History of Dublin p.47 although the owners complained of substantial damage to their property in 1642.Ball History of Dublin p.46 Battle of Rathmines In July 1649 the Irish Royalist leader, James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde advanced on Dublin, which was held by Parliamentary forces under Colonel Michael Jones. Anticipating that Ormonde would try to seize Baggotrath Castle, Jones took the precaution of partly destroying it. Nonetheless, Ormonde was determined that the castle should be fortified if possible. On 1 August a troop of 1500 men was sent to secure it but, for reasons which have never been clear,They may have been given false intelligence about the route, or simply lost their way. they took the whole night to travel a distance of about a mile.A pedestrian nowadays can walk the distance in half an hour, although admittedly on properly paved streets. When Ormonde himself arrived he found that nothing had been done to fortify the castle. Meanwhile, Jones had been alerted to Ormonde's arrival and attacked the castle with some 5000 men. The Royalist cavalry deserted and most of the foot soldiers were killed or captured, allowing Jones to move on to his decisive victory at Rathmines.Ball History of Dublin pp.47-48 Decay and ruin No effort seems to have been made by the Fitzwilliams (who owned another substantial Dublin property, Merrion Castle) to restore Baggotrath, whose ruins were described in detail by Austin Cooper in 1778, and drawn by Francis Grose in 1791, some years before what remained of the castle was demolished to allow for the extension of Baggot Street.Ball History of Dublin p.48 The name is preserved in Baggotrath Lane, a narrow side street which connects Lower Baggot Street with Merrion Street.

He wrote that the plays had \\"all the shocking trappings...is by turn thoughtful and dazzling, witty, provocative and, in the final play, even poetic...The whole program...is something of an exercise in skim-skating over the thin ice of good taste...
