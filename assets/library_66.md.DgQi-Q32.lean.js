Daeam is a wetland in Korea. Like the meaning of its name 'dragon swamp of big rocky mountain', the summit of Mt. Daeam (1340 m high above sea level) is formed of giant rocks. Near the peak of the mountain (1280 m above sea level), there is a natural wetland called Yongneup. Its coastal length is 210 m and its width is 275 m. It is the first Korean wetland to be registered on the list of the Ramsar Convention of Wetlands in 1997.  Characteristics  The name Yongneup signifies that it is a place where dragons rest when they fly up to the sky (Yong means dragon in Korean and neup means wetland). It is the highest moor with peat deposits in South Korea. It is foggy for more than 170 days a year and has a high level of precipitation. The average annual temperature is 12.2 degree Celsius and it has sub-zero temperature for more than 5 months per year. Due to its climate, Yongneup has peat deposits composed of undecomposed plants and this shows how plants have transformed for a few thousand years. On average, peat deposits accumulate at a rate of 0.5‚Äì1 mm per year; Yongneup's deepest peat deposits is 1.5 m deep.

He performed on rare occasions with a \\"backup band\\", claiming that a fictitious robot band had malfunctioned. Shows incorporated puppetry, multimedia and performances by female members (\\"Nurses\\" and \\"Scouts\\") of his street team, The Army of Toy Soldiers. Steel made a brief appearance on The Tonight Show and has had numerous interviews. Other interviews with Dr. Steel:        He was the subject of an article in Wired magazine regarding allegations that Dr. Horrible had copied his style. Steel has frequently been cited as an example of steampunk music. Musical career Steel began publicly performing in 1999, essentially busking on the streets of Los Angeles. A few years later, he began performing at venues like The Key Club and the California Institute of Abnormalarts. His live shows combined music with puppetry and video projection that reflect the stories and meanings of the songs. The albums Dr. Steel and Dr. Steel II: Eclectic Boogaloo were released digitally in 2001, followed by People of Earth in 2002. The Dr. Steel Collection (2004) was Steel's first CD release, featuring several previously released tracks, some slightly altered. The Dr. Steel Collection also features the track \\"Land of the Lost,\\" about the 1970s version of the show by the same name. Some attempts were made to get the song into the soundtrack of 2009 movie version of Land of the Lost, but they were unsuccessful. Steel's second CD release was The Dr. Steel Read-A-Long Album (2006). It was a limited distribution and quickly sold out. The album art included a recreation of the sleeve of read-along records, and the disc design resembled that of a vinyl record. In 2007, Steel re-released the first three albums, once again in digital format. Steel's music can often be heard on a number of steampunk radio broadcasts that stream worldwide, such as The Clockwork Cabaret. His song \\"Boogieman Boogie\\" was also included in a compilation of steampunk music released by Gilded Age Records. Musical style Steel's music is eclectic in genre, often combining the noise and distortion of industrial with aspects of European folk, classical, and even jazz, as well as hip-hop, opera and swing. Many songs feature samples from vintage public service announcements and educational films, such as Duck and Cover. Rue Morgue Magazine described the sound as \\"Industrial Hip-Hop Opera\\". Doctor Steel's 'mad scientist' personaSteel cited, as some of his musical influences, Igor Stravinsky, Tom Waits, Pink Floyd, Queen, Mike Patton, Nine Inch Nails, Danny Elfman, Beck, and John Zorn. Stage persona On stage, and in all public performances and interviews, Steel maintained the appearance of a mad scientist bent on conquering the world and becoming the future World Emperor. He claimed to be a former toymaker who, in a fit of rage over being fired for creating drastic designs such as babies with buzzsaws for hands, burned down the factory he worked at and was committed to a psychiatric institution. This back-story relates that Steel escaped the sanitarium and retreated to a deserted island laboratory, where he became bent on world conquest in order to create a \\"Utopian Playland\\" where his toy designs could be enjoyed. As a mad scientist, Steel is obsessed with conspiracy theories, giant robots, baking cupcakes and \\"mind control cookies\\", and experimenting with hamsters. In appearance, Steel drew on the mad scientist archetype, dressing in a white PVC lab coat (with comically large black buttons), black PVC gloves, black boots, shaved head, sinister goatee, and antique welder's goggles. When not in his \\"mad scientist\\" costume, Steel typically dressed in a very aristocratic neo-Victorian steampunk style, while still retaining his goggles. He was never seen without the goggles. Retirement In 2010, Dr. Steel announced plans to begin work on a new album, entitled \\"Toymonger.\\" However, in July 2011, after a long period of silence from him, it was announced that Doctor Steel had retired from the music industry, and a personal letter from Steel to the current head of the Army of Toy Soldiers in January 2012 confirmed this. (However, there was no other \\"official\\" or public announcement.) The Army of Toy Soldiers have decided to continue on as an organization, switching their focus from promoting the entertainer to promoting the philosophy he presented, such as the importance of creativity and building one's own Utopian Playland. Promotional videos and web videos Screencap from Building a Utopian Playland, showing a faux news conference.Doctor Steel appeared in numerous short videos released on his website and on his YouTube channel. One such is a six-minute \\"propaganda\\" film called Building a Utopian Playland, which ostensibly outlined his plans for world domination. Another is a series called The Dr. Steel Show, set in his fictitious lab on his fictitious private island. Episode 3, which is the official music video for his song, \\"Back and Forth\\", and featured video clips sent in by Toy Soldiers, was showcased on MTV's website as a part of their online video series, Steampunk Infiltrates The Mainstream. Steel also appeared in a video with fellow internet personality Agamemnon Tiberius Vacuum. Steel also released what he called \\"public service announcements\\" covering philosophical subjects such as transhumanism, freedom of thought, and subjective reality. (As a transhumanist, Dr. Steel has also been interviewed on his views by the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and has even published a paper on the subject.) Finally, the Toy Soldiers Unite website features a series of videos called Ask Dr. Steel, in which Steel himself answered questions asked by Toy Soldiers. In May 2010, Doctor Steel's videos were featured in one of Veronique Chevalier's Red Velvet Variety Shows. In May 2010, Dr. Steel released a music video to his song, \\"Childhood Don't a-Go-Go\\", directed by Tony Leonardi III. Dr. Horrible controversy In 2008, Joss Whedon released a short musical film online entitled Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Fans of Steel, and Steel himself, noted the similarities between Dr. Steel and Dr. Horrible: *both featured singing mad scientists who produced web videos; *both had an \\"Ask Dr. ___\\" segment; *the name of the production was similar to the title of one of Steel's albums, Dr. Steel Read-A-Long. This attracted the attention of national media and was reported in Coilhouse and also Wired magazine, in which Dr. Horrible co-writer Maurissa Tancharoen responded, \\"All we have to say on the subject is we've never heard of Dr. Steel before.\\" \\"There's room for everyone in this party,\\" she added. Discography * Dr. Steel (2001) * Dr. Steel II: Eclectic Boogaloo (2001) * People of Earth (2002) * The Dr. Steel Collection (2004) * Dr. Steel Read-A-Long (2006) Army of Toy Soldiers The Army of Toy Soldiers (formerly Dr. Steel's Army of Toy Soldiers; also known as Toy Soldiers Unite after the name of their website) was originally Dr. Steel's fan club and street team, and played into the Dr. Steel fiction, in that it was allegedly a tool in his plan for global domination. The Army considers itself a movement for social change, and since Steel's retirement it has begun to distance itself from Steel, but continue as an organization dedicated to promoting fun and its members' creative endeavors. The website for the organization, referred to playfully as the \\"digital bunker\\", was created by the then head of Dr. Steel's fan club, steampunk model and fashion designer Kate Lambert, aka \\"Sergeant Kato\\", in 2006. After Steel's retirement, Kato turned over the site to its current administrators, and most information regarding Steel was moved to an archive site.  Structure  The Toy Soldier Army has four main regiments: Toy Soldiers, Nurses, Toy Scouts and Engineers. (Originally, the Nurse and Scout regiments were reserved for females within the Army, whereas people of any gender could belong to the Toy Soldier regiment, but after Dr. Steel's retirement this was changed, and Nurses and Scouts became open to anyone.) The Army is further divided into divisions based upon geographical location as well as divisions based on creative interests (\\"Special Ops\\"). The Army is currently led by the admin of the website. There are no ranks ‚Äì all Toy Soldiers are considered equal ‚Äì although Toy Soldiers often give themselves fanciful \\"ranks\\" as part of the fun. However, Toy Soldiers who go \\"above and beyond\\" may be awarded the honorary title of \\"Yellow Jacket\\". Originally this title was given personally by Doctor Steel, but since Dr. Steel's retirement this award has been given out by the admins of the official website. To date, only 51 have achieved the status of Yellow Jacket. Example of a dieselpunk- inspired Toy Soldier uniform (although the Dr. Steel logo patch is no longer used.)  Uniforms  Toy Soldiers wear paramilitary \\"uniforms\\" with patches and color schemes, but are encouraged to design their own uniform so long as the required patches and colors are used. The basic color scheme for soldiers is black with yellow trim, although red trim may also be used sparingly. Female nurses generally wear white nurse uniforms with red trim, although a brown military uniform with garrison cap is also worn (see inset image). Scouts generally wear beige tops and black skirts or slacks. Engineers generally wear black overalls or coveralls, or black or white lab coats. The original \\"traditional\\" uniforms designed by Kato were dieselpunk inspired. A new set of uniform concepts released on the Army's website in 2013, designed by Sgt. Grinner, have a decidedly more cyberpunk appearance.  Operations  Toy Soldiers continue to promote Dr. Steel's philosophy, individually through \\"missions\\", while larger group events are known as \\"operations\\" or \\"invasions\\". Some Soldiers use their connections and access to the media for promotion, while others may choose to \\"propagandize\\" their school or workplace. Toy Soldiers frequently do charity and volunteer work in uniform, such as starting local clothing or toy drives and even donating to drives such as Toys for Tots, Light the Night Walk and Adopt a Highway. The Toy Soldiers have their own holiday, \\"Toy Soldier Day,\\" which is observed every year on March 4 (a play on \\"march forth\\"), and simultaneous invasions of Disney theme parks worldwide take place on the nearest Saturday to this day. (Without directly naming TSU, Disney‚Ä¢Pixar referenced the TSU-created holiday on March 4, 2015 in a tweet on their official Twitter page.) = Promotional material (\\"Propaganda\\") = Promotional material for the Toy Soldiers is referred to as \\"propaganda\\". The decision to use a term with such charged connotations was a deliberate satirical allusion to famous groups in the past who had plans for world domination, in order to spotlight or \\"hang a lampshade\\" on the tricks of mass manipulation. Some of the material was designed and created by Steel himself (such as the \\"propaganda posters\\", designed to resemble WWII propaganda posters), but Steel encouraged his fans to design their own propaganda as well. = Motto and Philosophy = The Army's motto, \\"Building a Utopian Playland\\", comes from the title of Dr. Steel's \\"Propaganda Video\\" of the same name, and expresses the group's core philosophy. Originally, it related to Steel's alleged plans to \\"take over the world\\", but also meant a metaphorical altering of one's own worldview through making having fun one's first priority and realizing one's creative potential, and the belief that if everyone did this, the world could be transformed. Steel called this concept a \\"world makeover\\".  Current activities  Since the announcement of Dr. Steel's retirement, the Army of Toy Soldiers have continued on as an organization dedicated to spreading the philosophy Dr. Steel presented. The Dr. Steel \\"angry face\\" logo (and uniform patch) has been dropped, having been replaced with Steel's grinning robot head logo. As an artistic network, the Army strongly encourages and supports independent artists and entertainers. The Army also continues to \\"invade\\" comic and steampunk conventions; they have had a regular fan tables at San Diego Comic Con and MCM Expo in London for several years now. Since 2010, the Toy Soldiers have participated yearly in the Doo Dah Parade in Pasadena, CA and have become \\"veteran crowd favorites.\\" (In 2016, Route 66 Magazine ran a story on the Doo Dah parade, featuring a member of the Toy Soldiers on the front cover.) And in 2012, several members of the UK division were invited to participate in the filming of Professor Elemental's music video, \\"I'm British.\\" The Army also has several semi-regular podcasts, which are released under the umbrella of the Toy Soldiers' YouTube channel, \\"TSU-TV\\", and its own recording label, \\"TSU Audio Labs\\". In keeping with its nonprofit status in the UK, in 2013 the Army donated its surplus budget over operating expenses to the children's charity Child's Play. In 2014, the Army teamed with MPserv.net to run a 48-hour livestreamed Minecraft marathon called \\"Operation: Dig Deep\\", raising over $1000 for Child's Play. In 2015 they repeated their gaming marathon, raising over $1500 for the Alzheimer's Society, and in 2016 the marathon raised over $2000 for e-NABLE, a grassroots community that creates 3-D printed prosthetics for children.

Ichthyosaurus integer Bronn 1844 was also reassigned to the genus by Maisch to create the new combination Suevoleviathan integer. Based on the relocation of the holotype of Suevoleviathan integer and an updated description of the specimen, Maxwell (2018) concluded that the two Suevoleviathan species are growth stages of the same species, meaning that S. integer has priority and becomes the epithet of the Suevoleviathan type species.Maxwell, E.

It remained in operation to the mid-twentieth century. History Small-scale gold mining is said to have started at Toi around 1370 during the period of the Ashikaga shogunate.Toi Gold Museum The gold mine was operated on a large scale from the time of Tokugawa Ieyasu in the late 16th century. Several mines were open in 1577, but Tokugawa Ieyasu endeavored to their development from 1601. He put the exploitation of the mine under the responsibility of a Kinzan Bugy≈ç selected from the ≈åkubo clan. Toi was one of around 60 goldmines located in the Izu Peninsula, including Yugashima or Nawaji, The gold and silver produced by these mines permitted the production of Tokugawa coinage, and allowed for the prosperity of the Tokugawa. The village of Toi itself became highly prosperous, with numerous trades flooding in to service the workers and the administration at the gold mine, so that Toi became known as \\"Toi Sengen\\" (ÂúüËÇ•ÂçÉËªí, \\"Toi of the 1,000 shops\\"). The mine became less productive as it became flooded. Workers were killed because of the exhausting conditions due to seeping hot springs, and poor oxygen content of air, leading to the installation of water pumps and ventilators at numerous intervals.Toi gold museum In 1917, gold was again discovered at the mine, and exploitation continued under the company Toi Kinzan KK. In 1931, the mine entered Sumitomo Group, and passed under Toi K≈çgy≈ç KK in 1942. The mine was ultimately closed in 1965 and then reopened for tourism. Characteristics Toi was the second most productive gold mine in Japan, after the gold mine of Sado in Niigata Prefecture. During its period of exploitation, it produced in total 40 tons of gold and 400 tons of silver, whereas Sado produced as much as 80 tons of gold. One ton of rock would produce in average 5 to 10 grams of gold, although 30 grams ore was common, and some rock has yielded as much as 600 g of gold per ton. Galleries The galleries of the mine total about 100 kilometers in length, over a surface of 37 hectares, and go as deep as 180 meters below sea level. The area visible for tourism is about 350m long, and goes about 150 meters deep into mountain rock. Legacy The mine is now partially open for visits, and has become a tourist attraction. A \\"Shrine of the mine gods\\" (Â±±Á•ûÁ§æ) is visible inside the galleries. The Toi Gold Museum (ÂúüËÇ•ÈªÑÈáëÈ§®) built nearby, describes the history of the mine and gold mining in Japan.

He was a balloon buster, as he destroyed two enemy observation balloons. This made him the fourth highest scoring South African. Military service Harrison originally served with an artillery regiment in German East Africa. He then joined the Royal Flying Corps in April 1917. From cadet he was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August 1917, and was confirmed in his rank and appointed a flying officer on 12 March 1918. In May he was assigned to No. 29 Squadron RAF. His timing was impeccable; the squadron was newly equipped with brand new RAF SE.5as. Beginning his victories the following month, he became the squadron's leading ace out of 26. While his 22 triumphs did not make up an overpowering part of the squadron's 385 victories, he was a steady scorer. A surviving SE5a, such as Harrison flew, in flight. His first victory was on 27 June 1918, when he flamed a Halberstadt C, using RAF SE.5a serial 8859 to deadly effect. He destroyed a Hannover C on 1 July. On 4 July, he was flying a signals intelligence sortie of \\"wireless interception duty,\\" in SE.5a serial 3915. He destroyed the LVG carrying the airborne radio, and burned one of its pair of escort Pfalz D.IIIs. He was awarded his Distinguished Flying Cross for this mission. On 8 July, he became an ace. By the middle of August, he was a double ace, scoring his tenth win on 13 August 1918. Two of these victories were over balloons. He ended August at an even dozen. By now, he had a favourite plane, serial number E5947. He would run off a series of seven victories in it, with the last being his 13th win on 6 September 1918. A squadron-mate then ruined it with a fast hard landing. In four different aircraft, Harrison scored six times in October, before being appointed a flight commander with the acting-rank of captain on the 29th, and three more times in November, his last on the 10th, the day before the armistice. His 22 victories tallied 13 enemy aircraft destroyed single-handed, four of which burned; two destroyed in conjunction with another pilot; four planes driven down out of control; two balloons destroyed single-handed. Harrison was awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre in July 1919. World War II service Harrison returned to military service during World War II as an intelligence officer in the South African Air Force, serving in Air Headquarters East Africa during the East African Campaign in 1941. Honours and awards ;Distinguished Flying Cross :Lieutenant Thomas Sinclair Harrison. ::When on wireless interception duty this officer engaged three enemy machines, shooting down one in flames. He was then attacked by three scouts and a two-seater; the latter he shot down. During the last few weeks he has further accounted for three hostile aeroplanes and a balloon, displaying vigour and gallantry in attack. ;Bar to the Distinguished Flying Cross :Lieutenant Thomas Sinclair Harrison, DFC. ::Bold in attack, skilful in manoeuvre, this officer never hesitates to engage the enemy, however superior in numbers. On 2 October he, with three other machines, took part in an engagement with eight Fokkers; four of these were destroyed, Lieut. Harrison accounting for one.

Its remains have been found in California, United States, in Triassic layers of the Carnian Hosselkus Limestone. Toretocnemus was named in 1902 by John Campbell Merriam.Merriam, J.C., 1902, \\"Triassic Ichthyopterygia from California and Nevada\\", Bulletin of the Department of Geology of the University of California, 3 (4): 63‚Äì108 The generic name is derived from Greek toretos, \\"perforated\\" and kneme, \\"shinbone\\". The type species is Toretocnemus californicus. Its holotype is UCMP 8100, a skeleton lacking the skull. Merriamia zitteli (Merriam 1903) Boulenger 1904, previously Leptocherius zitteli,Merriam, J.C., 1903, \\"New ichthyosaurs from the Upper Triassic of California\\", Bulletin of the Department of Geology of the University of California, 3 (12): 249‚Äì263 was renamed Toretocnemus zitteli in 1999. Its holotype is UCMP 8099, a skull, lower jaws and front of the torso. Toretocnemus is about two metres long. In 2001, Toretocnemus vertebrae were found in Sonora, Mexico, near the mining town of El Antimonio. Although ichthyosaur vertebrae are quite commonly found here, most of these were shonisaurid or shastasaurid vertebrae. These ones were noticeable for being much smaller than the usual finds, and were identified as Toretocnemus. The vertebrae ranged in diameter from 13 to 28 mm, were all taller than they were wide, and amphicoelous. Neural spines were not present, but there were clear grooves for their articulation. The processes for rib articulation were small and well-separated, with two on each vertebra - a diapophysis and a parapophysis. This is diagnostic of Toretocnemus. The vertebrae being found here suggest an unconventional origin for the Antimonio Formation, which is that it was separated from the East Klamath Terrane rather than from similar formations in Nevada, as Toretocnemus has been found in the East Klamath Terrane but never in Nevada. This is at odds with the established theory. However, as Toretocnemus was a small ichthyosaur and probably not a very strong open-ocean swimmer, it could be that these were from a different population which were geographically isolated and speciating.

The bathhouse is named after Imamzadeh Sultan Amir Ahmad, whose mausoleum is nearby. Sultan Amir Ahmad Bathhouse, with an area of around 1000 square meters, consists of two main parts: the sarbineh (dressing hall) and garmkhaneh (hot bathing hall). The sarbineh is a large octagonal hall and has an octagonal pool in the middle, separated by 8 pillars from the outer section. There are four pillars in the garmkhaneh, which make smaller bathing rooms all around as well as the entrance section to the khazineh (final bathing room) in the middle. The interior of the bathhouse is decorated with turquoise and gold tilework, plasterwork, brickwork, as well as artistic paintings. The roof of the bathhouse is made of multiple domes that contain convex glasses to provide sufficient lighting to the bathhouse while concealing it from the outside.

Adapted by Belgian writer Stanislas-Andr√© Steeman and Clouzot from Steeman's 1939 book of the same title, it was Clouzot's debut feature film. The film is about the hunt by detective Wens (Pierre Fresnay) for the murderer Monsieur Durand, who leaves calling cards and manages to be everywhere at once. With the aspiring actress Mila Malou (Suzy Delair), Wens follows clues to a seedy boarding house where he hopes to find the murderer. The Murderer Lives at Number 21 was the fourth film written by Clouzot for the Nazi run film company Continental Films who made films to take the place of banned American films. Clouzot made several changes from the script including the characters Mila and Wens from his previous screenplay for Le dernier des six (1941). The film was released in France to critical acclaim. Plot Inspector Wenceslas (referred to as \\"Wens\\" for short) VorobeychikIn Russian this name means \\"Sparrow\\". is assigned the case of a serial killer who leaves a calling card with the name 'Monsieur Durand' on his victims. Wens' mistress is the ditsy struggling actress Mila Malou who is determined to get noticed, and attempts to help Wens find the criminal. Wens discovers that Durand is a tenant at a boarding house at No. 21 Avenue Junot. Wens takes a room at the house in disguise as a Protestant minister. Suspects are arrested, but while each is in jail another Durand murder occurs. Both Mila and Wens discover who is responsible for the murders. Wens is captured, and as he is about to be killed when Mila and the police arrive and rescue him.

The budget for the film was considered to be quite generous and included materials that were extravagant by pre-war standards.Mayne, French Film Guide, 29. As American films were banned during the German occupation of France during World War II, Continental Films aimed at quality and commercial success in their pictures and produced films that were to take the place of the American films.Lloyd, Henri-Georges Clouzot, 30. The Murderer Lives at Number 21 is a thriller with light comedic elements, which was the style of most mystery films during the occupation.Williams, Republic of Images, 260. Henri-Georges Clouzot was assisted by the story's original author Stanislas-Andr√© Steeman in writing the film.Lloyd, Henri-Georges Clouzot, 31.Lloyd, Henri-Georges Clouzot, 32. The film marked the second collaboration between the two, who both collaborated on Le Dernier des six (1941) which was a previous screenplay by Clouzot and Steeman. Steeman was not happy with how Clouzot had handled either of the films.Mayne, French Film Guide, 25. Clouzot made changes from the original story including changing the setting of the story from London to Paris.Lloyd, Henri-Georges Clouzot, 35. Clouzot also wrote in Wens and Mila Malou from Le Dernier des six to the script. Both Pierre Fresnay and Suzy Delair found Clouzot to be a demanding and even violent director. Delair recalled how Clouzot got his performance out of the actors, by stating that \\"He slapped me. So what? He slapped others as well...He was tough but I'm not about to complain\\". Fresnay recalled that Clouzot \\"worked relentlessly, which made for a juicy spectacle...That's to say nothing for his taste of violence, which he never tried with me\\". Release The Murderer Lives at Number 21 was released in France on . It was released in the United States in 1947. On its initial release in France, The Murderer Lives at Number 21 was popular with critics and audiences.Mayne, French Film Guide, 28. A reviewer from Le Miroir de l'Ecran noted the delighted reaction of the audience at the film's premier, noting how \\"amusing and witty scenes alternate judiciously with more severe and dramatic ones\\" and that the film created a \\"clever cocktail of humor and drama\\". A reviewer from Cin√©-mondial praised the directing of Clouzot, stating that he \\"has put the finishing touches on a production that is dense, concise, mobile, varied, all in the service of a rich imagination\\". In the United States, a reviewer for The New York Times wrote that \\"The Murderer Lives at Number 21, despite a wandering script that fails to tie up many loose ends, is good fun for whodunnit fans\\".New York Times, Film Reviews, 2199. In 2013 the film received a DVD re-release from Eureka Entertainment as part of their Masters of Cinema series. Providing a 21st-century analysis, Bring The Noise UK reviewer Michael Dodd noted the \\"numerous brave little digs at the occupying Germans\\" present in the story. He particularly singled out a scene in which a criminal has his hands raised, only to have one arm lowered by Inspector Wens so that he may light a match on the man's neck, thus rendering the villain into performing a Nazi salute. \\"It is hard to believe that the strict German authorities missed the subtext of such a shot\\", he concluded \\"and the fact that he even dared to place it in the film at all is a testament to the character of Clouzot\\".http://www.bringthenoiseuk.com/201305/films/film- review-the-murderer-lives-at-21-lassassin-habite-au-21 References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Lloyd, Christopher.

The graphic novel's film rights were acquired by producer Lawrence Gordon in 1986. Many problems halted the adaptation's development, with four different studios and various directors and screenwriters being attached to the project through twenty years. In 2006, Zack Snyder, who at the time was filming 'another comic book adaptation', was hired by Warner Bros. to helm Watchmen. Filming started in 2007, and following deals with two of the previous companies involved in the development‚ÄîParamount Pictures was responsible for international distribution rights after budgetary issues in 2004, resulting in a lawsuit by 20th Century Fox. Fox, which was already contacted by Gordon in 1987, received $1 million of the gross‚Äîthe Watchmen adaptation was finally released in March 2009. Pre-production Failed projects In August 1986, producer Lawrence Gordon acquired the film rights to Watchmen for 20th Century Fox, with producer Joel Silver working on the film. Fox asked author Alan Moore to write a screenplay based on his story, but when Moore declined the studio enlisted screenwriter Sam Hamm. On September 9, 1988, Hamm turned in his first draft, but said that condensing a 338-page, nine-panel-a-page comic book into a 128-page script was arduous. He took the liberty of re-writing Watchmens complicated ending into a \\"more manageable\\" conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox. Fox put the film into turnaround in 1991, and Gordon set up the project at a new company, Largo International, with Fox distributing the film. Although Largo closed three years later, Fox was promised that they would be involved if the project was revived. Gordon and Silver moved the project to Warner Bros., where Terry Gilliam was attached to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in Charles McKeown to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, Warren Skaaren, and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character Rorschach's journal as a voice-over, and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed. According to Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons, filming was to take place at Pinewood Studios. Silver wanted to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Manhattan. Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and Die Hard 2 respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film‚Äîa quarter of the necessary budget. As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that Watchmen was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, \\"Reducing [the story] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me to take away the essence of what Watchmen is about.\\" When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently. The director again declined, believing that the comic book would be better directed as a five- hour miniseries. In October 2001, Gordon and Universal Studios signed screenwriter David Hayter to write and direct Watchmen in a \\"seven-figure deal\\". Hayter hoped to begin filming in early 2002, but did not turn in his first draft until July 2002. In May 2003, Hayter said he had Alan Moore's blessing on the film, despite Moore's disagreement with the project since its first incarnation. In July 2003, Watchmen producer Lloyd Levin announced the completion of Hayter's script, which he called \\"a great adaptation [...] that absolutely celebrates the book\\". Ultimately, Hayter and the producers left Universal over creative differences, and in October 2003, Gordon and Levin expressed interest in setting up Watchmen at Revolution Studios. The pair intended to shoot the film in Prague, but the project fell apart at Revolution Studios. In July 2004, it was announced Paramount Pictures would produce Watchmen, and they hired Darren Aronofsky to direct Hayter's script. Gordon and Levin remained attached, collaborating with Aronofsky's producing partner, Eric Watson. Eventually, Aronofsky left to focus on The Fountain, and Paramount replaced him with Paul Greengrass, with a target release date of summer 2006. At this time, Paddy Considine was involved in negotiations for Rorschach. Jude Law (a fan of the comic) and Tom Cruise both lobbied for Ozymandias. Greengrass wanted Joaquin Phoenix for Dan Dreiberg and Hilary Swank as Laurie. To publicize the film, Paramount launched a now-defunct Watchmen teaser website that had a message board as well as computer wallpaper available to download. Graphic artist Tristan Schane drew designs of Dr. Manhattan for the film, which depicted him with visible intestines. Gilliam read Greengrass's revision of Hayter's script and liked it, but told the director he did not think the studio would greenlight such a dark film. In March 2005, with rumors that high-profile projects, including Watchmen, were in danger of being cut, Paramount's CEO Donald De Line began urging a reduction in Watchmens budget so the film could get the greenlight. When Brad Grey took over as Paramount's CEO, Levin feared potential budget cuts, so he made plans to move the project outside the UK in an effort to save money. Before he could, Paramount placed Watchmen in turnaround, again. In March 2019, concept footage from David Hayter's project was released on YouTube featuring Iain Glen in the role of Nite-Owl and Ray Stevenson in the role of Rorschach. In October 2005, Gordon and Levin began talks with Warner Bros., originally the second studio to be attached to Watchmen, and confirmed in December 2005 that Warner Bros. had picked up the film, but that Greengrass was no longer attached to direct. In addition, the film was marked as an \\"open writing assignment\\", which meant David Hayter's script would be put aside. Despite this change, Hayter expressed his hope that his script would be used by Warner Bros. and that he would be attached to direct his \\"dream project\\". Successful development After Warner Bros. officially became involved, the studio claimed that because Paramount had not fully reimbursed Universal for its development costs, Paramount had no legal claim over the film rights. Therefore, it would not be entitled to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. After negotiations between the studios, they agreed that Paramount would own 25% of the film and would distribute it outside North America. Impressed with Zack Snyder's work on the film 300, an adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book of the same name, Warner Bros. approached him to direct an adaptation of Watchmen. After spending a couple of weeks deciding whether he wanted to direct the film or not, Warner Bros. officially announced Snyder‚Äôs hiring on June 23, 2006, with Alex Tse attached to write the script. Drawing from \\"the best elements\\" from two of Hayter‚Äôs drafts, Tse‚Äôs script returned to the original Cold War setting of the Watchmen comic. Warner Bros. was open to keeping the 1980s setting, although less so to the R-rating that Snyder wanted; Snyder also decided to add a title montage sequence to introduce the audience to the alternate history of the United States that the film presented. Snyder kept the ending from one of Hayter's drafts, which simplified details of the conspiracy within the story, because he felt it would allow more screen time to explore characters' backstories. Snyder said that he wanted the film to hold the same level of detail that was contained within the comic, with all of the easter eggs that were hidden within each frame of the comic's panels. As such, Snyder used the comic book as his storyboard, travelling with a copy and making notes on its pages. Next to the novel, Snyder cited Taxi Driver and Seven as visual influences. To make the film more topical, Snyder emphasized the existing subplot concerning energy resources. Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman met with Snyder twice during the later stages of pre-production to further revise the script, although Snyder explained the script was merely a document for the studio, and it was his storyboards that were his true guide while making the movie. James Kakalios, author of The Physics of Superheroes, was also hired as a scientific consultant. Production Snyder hoped to have principal photography take place from June-September 2007, but filming was delayed until September 17, 2007. Snyder wanted a $150 million budget, but Warner Bros. preferred the budget remain under $100 million; the film ultimately finished with a budget of approximately $120 million. The production took place in Vancouver, where a New York City back lot was built. Sound stages were used for apartments and offices, while sequences on Mars and Antarctica were shot against green screens. Ten visual effects companies, Sony Pictures Imageworks and Intelligent Creatures among them, came on board to work on the film, which ended up having 1,100 shots featuring effects, a quarter of them being computer-generated imagery. alt=A case with two handguns, both with a stamped Smiley Face - one of the guns has \\"To Edward Blake, With Gratitude\\" around the Smiley, while the other has \\"Richard Nixon - 1976\\" -, dogtags, and a circular plaque, written by Richard Nixon, stating they are a gift to the Comedian in recognition for his services. Comic book artists Adam Hughes and John Cassaday were hired to work on character and costume designs for the film. Costume tests were being done by March 2007. 300 associate producer Wesley Coller portrayed Rorschach in a costume test, which Snyder inserted into a trailer that accompanied the release of 300. Although he intended to stay faithful to the look of the characters in the comic, Snyder wanted Nite Owl to look scarier and Ozymandias to possess authentic Egyptian attire and artifacts. Ultimately, Oyzmandias, Nite Owl and Silk Spectre changed most from the comic, as Snyder felt \\"audiences might not appreciate the naivet√© of the original costumes. So, there has been some effort to give them a [...] modern look‚Äîand not modern in the sense of 2007, but modern in terms of the superhero aesthetic\\". Costume designer Michael Wilkinson added that the costumes had to look realistic and protective, and that the Nite Owl costume should reflect Dan's interest in aerodynamics. The chain mail in his costume resemble a bird's feathers. Snyder also wanted the costumes to \\"comment directly on many of today‚Äôs modern masked vigilantes\\": The Ozymandias costume, with its molded muscles and nipples, parodies the costumes in Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Throughout filming, Snyder also kept adding in dialogue to mention more of the characters' backstories so the film would be as faithful as possible. Production designer Alex McDowell intended Nixon's war room to pay tribute to the war room in the film Dr. Strangelove. He also wanted Dr. Manhattan's apartment, which is inside his laboratory, to look like the work of Maison Jansen, explaining that \\"the powers that be, who know nothing about design, but needed [Manhattan] to feel like he was the most important guy in America\\". The apartment also echoes the film The Man Who Fell to Earth, with a book prop named Masterpieces in Paint and Poetry and a tennis courtroom with similar wallpaper. Set designers selected four Kansas City sculptors' works for use on the set of Dr. Manhattan's apartment, after discovering their works on the Internet. Filming ended on February 19, 2008. Post-production Music Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He planned to visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view assembly cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live and Die in L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building to have a more traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes. The film uses some of the songs mentioned in the comic. Bates said the challenge was composing music that would transition effectively into these famous songs. One of the songs is \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" by Bob Dylan from whom Snyder and Bates received permission to use the stems so the three-minute song could play over the six-minute opening montage. Now-defunct punk-rock band My Chemical Romance, whose former members are fans of the comic, covered Dylan's \\"Desolation Row\\" for the first half of the closing credits. The film also features two pieces from Philip Glass' score to 1982 film Koyaanisqatsi accompanying the birth of Dr. Manhattan. Two albums, Watchmen: Music from the Motion Picture and Watchmen: Original Motion Picture Score were released on February 24, 2009 by Warner Sunset and Reprise Records. Additionally, a 12\\" vinyl picture disc was released on January 27, 2009. The A-side features My Chemical Romance's cover version of \\"Desolation Row\\", and the B-side features \\"Prison Fight\\" composed by Tyler Bates for the film's score. Both songs will also be featured on the Music From the Motion Picture and Original Motion Picture Soundtrack albums, respectively. A box set consisting of seven 7\\" picture disks was released on March 24, 2009. This set will also include My Chemical Romance performing \\"Desolation Row\\", as well as thirteen tracks from the Tyler Bates score. Editing Snyder's first cut of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself \\"the gatekeeper\\" of the comic's easter eggs, \\"while [the studio] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost perspective on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me.\\" Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized there was a way to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which \\"was easy without destroying the movie\\". Moore and Gibbons' involvement When 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to Watchmen, the comic's writer Alan Moore was initially excited about the film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of Comics Interview, he revealed Sam Hamm, who was attached to write, visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported to the real world created as a result of time travel. In an interview with Varietys Danny Graydon, during Warner Bros.'s first possession of feature film rights for Watchmen, Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others' opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he \\"didn't think it was filmable\\". Moore clarified for Graydon, \\"I didn't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which are there, but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn't.\\" In December 2001, Moore further explained his opposition, citing how a reader can take the time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intended to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore‚Äôs opinion, Hayter's script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added that he would not be going to see the film when completed. Moore said, \\"My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee.\\" In November 2006, Zack Snyder said that he hoped to speak to Moore before filming, though the writer had sworn off involvement with film or television productions after his disagreement over the V for Vendetta film adaptation. Moore signed a deal to go uncredited on the film, and for his share of the income be given to Gibbons, as he had done on V for Vendetta. Before filming began, Snyder said, \\"[I] totally respect his wishes to not be involved in the movie.\\" Moore expressed discontent over the choice of the director, saying that he \\"had a lot of problems\\" with the comic book 300 and that, while he had not seen it, he had heard that Snyder's film adaptation was racist, homophobic, and \\"sublimely stupid\\". In an early interview with Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker, Watchmen artist Dave Gibbons said that he thought the time had passed to make a Watchmen movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a Watchmen movie was during the success of the 1989 Batman film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told Neon magazine that he was \\"[‚Ä¶] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book\\". Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like The Prisoner. When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse. Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted. He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicized the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled Watching the Watchmen. Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship. Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist John Higgins also returned to work on. Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping through the book, with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details. Litigation On February 14, 2008, 20th Century Fox brought a lawsuit against Warner Bros. that alleged copyright infringement on the Watchmen film property. The studio believed it held the rights to produce the film, or at least distribute it, no matter how many studios Watchmen passed through, and sought to block its release. Warner Bros. said that Fox repeatedly failed to exercise its rights over various incarnations of the production. Through producer Lawrence Gordon, Fox had bought the rights to the comic book in 1986. Fox alleges that when it put the project into turnaround in 1994, a separate 1991 deal that transferred some of the rights to Gordon still gave them the option of distribution, sequel rights, and a share of the profits should it be made by any other studio. Fox's interpretation of the 1994 turnaround deal also meant that Gordon would not fully control the rights until the studio's development costs‚Äîestimated by Fox at $1 million‚Äîhad been reimbursed. Despite originally passing on the project, Fox also alleged that its agreement with Gordon contained a \\"changed elements\\" clause, meaning that if Gordon changed any of the key creative personnel on the film, Fox would have first option on participation, claiming that Gordon did not inform them of Snyder's joining the production in 2005. Fox alleged that it contacted Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, and told the studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay that formed the basis of the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge. On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's claim to a copyright interest in the film. An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of Watchmen. Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered the chance to make Watchmen. Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development. An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was \\"one of the most unintelligible pieces of shit they had read in years\\". On January 15, 2009, the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement. Fox would receive a share of the box office, but no future ownership of the film. The settlement awarded Fox up to $10 million in development costs and legal fees, plus worldwide gross participation scaling from 5 to 8.5 percent.

Its historic centre, centred around the ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov Castle, has been a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992 and was given this status along with the historic Prague castle district. Etymology Krumlov has its origin in Middle High German Krumme Aue, which can be translated as crooked meadow, after a bend of the Vltava. The town's name begins with ƒåesk√Ω (\\"Bohemian\\") to differentiate it from Moravsk√Ω Krumlov in south Moravia. History The settlement arose beneath the castle, which was built from about 1240 onwards by a local branch of the noble V√≠tkovci family, descendants of Witiko of Prƒçice. The fortress was first mentioned in a 1253 deed as Chrumbenowe. It was also mentioned in the 1255 Frauendienst poem by minnesinger Ulrich von Liechtenstein. Located at a ford of an important trade route in the Kingdom of Bohemia, a settlement arose soon afterwards below the castle. The Czech name Krumlov is documented as early as in 1259. In 1302 the V√≠tkovci line became extinct and King Wenceslaus II ceded the town and castle to the Rosenberg family. Peter I of Rosenberg (d. 1347), the Lord Chamberlain of King John of Bohemia, resided here and had the present upper castle erected in the early 14th century. The majority of inhabitants were German-speaking at that time, having migrated from neighbouring Austria and Bavaria in the course of the Ostsiedlung. A Jewish community is documented since 1334. By 1336, Czechs may have formed a small minority, which had its own priest.Walter Kuhn, Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung in der Neuzeit, Vol. 1 (Cologne 1955), p. 85. The Rosenbergs strongly promoted trade and crafts within the town walls. In the late 15th century, when gold was found next to the town, German miners came to settle, which shifted the ethnic balance even more. In one of the churches the sermons were preached in Czech until 1788, when St. Jo≈°t Church was closed.Ecclesiastical History of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov William of Rosenberg (1535‚Äì1592), High Treasurer and High Burgrave of Bohemia, had the castle rebuilt in a Renaissance style. In 1602 William's brother Peter Vok of Rosenberg (1539‚Äì1611) sold Krumlov to the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II, who gave it to his natural son Julius d'Austria. After the Bohemian Revolt and the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, Emperor Ferdinand II gave Krumlov to the noble House of Eggenberg and the town became seat of the mediate Duchy of Krumlov. From 1719 until 1947 the castle belonged to the House of Schwarzenberg. There were 8,662 inhabitants in Krummau an der Moldau in 1910, including 7,367 Germans and 1,295 Czechs. After the World War I, the town was a part of the Bohemian Forest Region which was initially declared to be part of German-Austria. By the end of 1918 the Czechoslovak army had occupied the region, which became part of Czechoslovakia. In 1938 it was annexed by Nazi Germany, as part of the Reichsgau Oberdonau unit of Sudetenland under the Munich Agreement. After World War II the town's long- standing German-speaking population was expelled and the town was returned to Czechoslovakia.History of the town of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov During the Communist era of Czechoslovakia, historic Krumlov fell into disrepair, but since the Velvet Revolution of 1989 much of the town's former beauty has been restored, and it is now a popular holiday destination, with large numbers of tourists from Europe and from Asian countries such as China and Japan. In August 2002, the town was damaged in a great flood of the Vltava River. Economy ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov is home to the Pivovar Eggenberg brewery. Transport ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov has a railway station served by GW Train Regio and ƒåesk√© dr√°hy situated on a line between ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice and ƒåern√Ω K≈ô√≠≈æ (a railway junction near the village of Sto≈æec). There has been a direct train to Prague since 2016, with a traveling time of 2h 48m. Several bus companies operate direct bus services to Prague. There are also direct shuttle minibus services to several cities including Prague, Munich and Vienna. Sights Most of the architecture of the old town and castle dates from the 14th through 17th centuries; the town's structures are mostly in Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles. The core of the old town is within a horseshoe bend of the river, with the old Latr√°n neighborhood and castle on the other side of the Vltava. Castle Krumlov Castle ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov Castle is unusually large for a town of its size; within the Czech Republic it is second in extent only to the Hradƒçany castle complex of Prague. The castle was first mentioned in written sources in 1240. Inside its grounds are a large rococo garden, an extensive bridge over a deep gap in the rock upon which the castle is built, and the castle itself, which in turn consists of many defined parts dating from different periods. After the garden had been inadequately maintained in the second half of the 20th century, the site was included in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. With financial support from American Express the garden's central fountain was documented and reconstructed, and remains functional today.World Monuments Fund ‚Äì ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov Garden It is relatively unique in that it is surrounded by a moat filled not with water, but with bears. This was an attempt the erstwhile rulers of the castle to associate themselves with the powerful Orsini family ‚Äì whose name is a pun on the Italian word for bear; orso. Castle theatre The stage of the castle theatre ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov Castle preserves its Baroque theatre, built in 1680‚Äì82 under Prince Johann Christian I von Eggenberg and renovated with up-to-date stage equipment under Josef Adam zu Schwarzenberg from 1765 to 1766. It is one of few such court theaters to retain its original stage machinery, scenery and props.There are others at Drottningholm and Gripsholm in Sweden. Much Baroque theater equipment is on display at the Royal Palace of G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, near Budapest. Due to its age, the theater is only used three times a year (only twice open to the public), when a Baroque opera is performed in simulated candlelight. Visitors can take a guided tour beneath the stage to catch a glimpse of the wood-and- rope apparatus that allowed stage settings to be moved in and out at the same time as the audience was diverted with fireworks and smoke. The castle's last private owner was Adolph Schwarzenberg. It was here that he received President Edvard Bene≈° and gave him a large contribution for the defence of Czechoslovakia against the growing threat of Nazi Germany. His property was seized by the Gestapo in 1940 and then confiscated by the Czechoslovak government in 1947. Since 1959 the revolving auditorium is located in the gardens. Museums ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov has a museum dedicated to the painter Egon Schiele, who lived in the town. In the town center there is also a museum dedicated to the semi-precious gemstone Moldavite. View of ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov from a hill Culture ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov hosts a number of festivals and other events each year including the Five-Petaled Rose Festival (a reference to the rose of the Ro≈æmberk crest), which is held on the summer solstice weekend. The downtown area is turned into a medieval town with craftsmen, artists, musicians, and local people in medieval costume. Activities include jousting, fencing, historical dance performances, and folk theater, in the Castle precincts and along the river. It concludes with a fireworks display. The International Music Festival ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov begins in July and ends in August, and features international music of various genres. Other such events are held throughout the year. The summer music festivals include the blues, rock, and soul festival Open Air Krumlov, held in late June at Eggenberg Brewery Garden. Since the Velvet Revolution in 1989, over eighty restaurants have been established in the area. Many restaurants are located along the river and near the castle. In popular culture ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov has been used for locations in movies such as The Illusionist (2006) and Hostel (2005), as well as the 1973 German movie ' (Dream City).IMDb Retrieved 28 March 2017.

The first major air raid occurred on the night of July 16, 1945.Carter.

A year after the war, the United States Army Air Forces's Strategic Bombing Survey (Pacific War) reported that 44.8 percent of the city had been totally destroyed.Wainstock. The Decision to Drop the Atomic Bomb. p. 9. Following the July 16 air raid, the United States Navy launched another attack with 16 SB2C Helldivers and 24 F4U Corsairs launched from the USS Wasp, USS Shangri La and USS Yorktown on July 30, 1945. This attack was directed specifically at the production facilities of Nissan aircraft. Eighteen 500 lb bombs were dropped on Buildings 2, 6 and 7 of the plant, killing 25 workers, mostly schoolchildren who had been conscripted as labor. This raid was followed on August 13 by another attack involving 61 aircraft launched from USS Hancock, USS Belleau Wood, USS Bennington, USS Lexington and USS San Jacinto. The primary target was again the Nissan aircraft production facilities, by this time virtually abandoned due to lack of materials and damage in the previous air raid.

History The Hiratsuka Naval Ammunitions Arsenal was initially established as a private joint venture enterprise by the foreign firms of Armstrong Whitworth, Nobel, and Vickers in September 1905. All three companies were very active in the supply of weaponry for warships to the early Imperial Japanese Navy. The plant was purchased by the Navy in April 1919, and came under the operational control of the Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department. Its facilities were greatly expanded from 1939-1941 due to the military buildup prior to the start of the Pacific War. The facilities consisted of seven plants: # Smokeless powder for rockets and artillery # Nitrocellulose and mixed acids production # Various acids and hydrogen production # Design and Engineering, prototype development # Machine gun ammunition production, solvent recovery # Naval artillery shells # Nitroglycerin production On the night of July 16, 1945 the facilities were attacked by 138 B-29 Superfortress bombers of the USAAF 20th Air Force, 314th Bombardment Wing which dropped a total of 1163 tons of incendiary bombs on the city, destroying most of the city center.

Early life and education Born in the Bronx on March 18, 1941, Black graduated from the Bronx High School of Science. He majored in Philosophy at Columbia University and received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1965.Pearce, Jeremy. \\"Dr. Ira B.

Professional career He was on the faculty of the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University from 1975 to 1990, serving as the Chief of its Laboratory of Developmental Neurology as the Nathan Cummings Professor of Neurology. In 1990 he became the Chair of the Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology at the UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Black was an advocate for research using stem cells to repair damage from such conditions as cancer and Alzheimer's disease and his own research showed that the technique could be used to encourage the body's own stem cells to create needed new cells and as a form of gene therapy. Studies he performed in 2000 that were published in the Journal of Neuroscience Research showed that when an antioxidant was added to stem cells extracted from bone marrow, the undifferentiated stem cells transformed into cells with the characteristics of neurons within minutes and were successfully transplanted into the brains and spinal cords of rats. The results were called \\"an incredible achievement\\" in opening the path to creating treatments for conditions that had been previously untreatable by using stem cells to create needed cells of different forms. Black's approach was to use neurons developed from the individual's own adult stem cells to avoid issues of transplant rejection without requiring modifications to the genome, while avoiding the ethical concerns raised with the use of embryonic stem cells.Research Summary , University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

As director of the Stem Cell Institute, he expressed his frustration with federal opposition to embryonic stem cell research, stating that the therapies that could result from such studies had the potential to \\"get patients out of bed and out of wheelchairs\\" and that the researchers in the U.S. were trailing those elsewhere who were able to make further progress in their studies.Kelley, Tina. \\"In Race Toward First Stem Cell Research Institute, New Jersey Stalls\\", The New York Times, July 31, 2005.

The festival is held on the islands of Hus√∏ya and Sanna. The islands are only accessible by ferry boat from the mainland in Lur√∏y. Venues have included an ancient cave, a church with blacked-out windows (to block out the Midnight sun which shines for 23 hours a day), and tents. The festival attracts many people from neighbouring communities who visit the camp to enjoy the music and unique nature of the festival. History Nine thousand years ago, some pioneers migrated to these islands out in the Norwegian Sea. There was not much land that could be farmed nor many trees that could be felled, but the richness of the surrounding ocean made it possible for people to settle. Even today, this is one of the richest fishing grounds in Norway. Over the centuries that followed the ocean richness has supported the small population of 400 people who became important trading partners in the international fish market. Most of what comes out of the ocean is exported. This also means that this isolated island always has been a highly international place. This international music festival celebrates the history and culture of Tr√¶na by bringing new Norwegian \\"fresh\\" musical expression into the open in different genres.

Development  DWL studied a small twin-engined STOL utility aircraft as a private venture due to the lack of official support, hoping to kindle new markets in multi-engined, utility and business aircraft. The RWD 18s safe handling characteristics and STOL capability were derived from the full span leading edge slats, which were operated by servo suction from a leading edge mounted venturi tube, and the fixed tri-cycle undercarriage. Construction was to have been mixed with wooden cantilever high wings having anhedral on the inner sections, fitted with full span powered leading edge slats and trailing edge flaps. The fuselage was a welded steel tube framework faired with wooden formers, covered with plywood and fabric, fitted out with a dual control cockpit and a bench seat in the cabin for two or three. At the rear of the fuselage a cantilever twin finned wooden tail unit was fitted to improve low-speed yaw control and stability. The spatted undercarriage legs were cantilevered from the engine nacelles and the fuselage under the nose with the main wheels fitted with 'Bendix' pneumatic brake units and the nosewheel steerable from the rudder bar. Any engine of around 150 hp could be fitted, but the prototype was fitted with 150 hp Cirrus Major four-cylinder inverted in-line engines fitted in nacelles at the junctions of the inner and outer wings. An RWD 9 was converted to the RWD 20, by fitting a tri-cycle undercarriage, to speed the development of the RWD 18s, with extensive trials carried out including rough and ploughed field landings, take-offs and taxiing. Flight trials were scheduled to be carried out in December 1939 but the incomplete prototype was destroyed in an air raid during the German invasion of 1939.

He is sometimes called William I to distinguish him from William of Agen, second patriarch of that name, but he was the second William to serve as prior of the Holy Sepulchre after William the Englishman.The first William who was prior of the Holy Sepulchre was William the Englishman who went on to become Archbishop of Tyre. In his history, William II of Tyre, the historian, wrote, ‚Äúin the fourth year after Tyre had been [captured] (that is, in 1127/28), the king, patriarch, and other leading men elected (as archbishop of Tyre) William, the venerable prior of the church of the Sepulchre of the Lord‚Äù, adding that this William was ‚Äúan Englishman by birth, and a man of most exemplary life and character‚Äù. A few chapters later, William of Tyre reports that when the Patriarch Stephen died (in 1130), ‚Äúhe was succeeded by William, prior of the church of the Sepulchre of the Lord‚Ä¶He was Flemish by birth, a native of Mesines.‚Äù Two Williams were prior of the Holy Sepulchre at an early time then, with William of Mesines (Flanders) probably directly succeeding William the Englishman as Prior of the Holy Sepulchre. This also means that William of Mesines could only have been prior from 1127 (the year of the election of William the Englishman to the archbishopric of Tyre) to 1130, the year of his own election as Patriarch. See William of Tyre, \\"A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea\\", Vol. 1, trans. Emily Babcock and A.C. Krey, Bk. XIII, Ch. 23 and Bk. XIII, Ch. 26. William of Tyre described William of Mesines as a man of \\"praiseworthy habits\\".Christopher Tyerman, England and the Crusades, 1095‚Äì1588 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 29. As Patriarch, he was an important supporter of Melisende during her regency and is described as a man capable yet pliable.Nicholson, 444. He received a letter from Bernard of Clairvaux urging him to support the Knights Templar, who had received their papal privileges at the same time as William's embassy to Rome.Malcolm Barber, The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 59. William took the initiative in constructing a castle, the \\"Castrum Arnaldi\\" (or Chastel Arnoul) at Yalo, to guard the road between Jerusalem and Jaffa in 1132‚Äì33, along with some citizens. It was later a Templar stronghold.Marianne Ailes and Malcolm Barber, The History of the Holy War: Ambroise's Estoire de la Guerre Sainte, II. Translation (Boydell Press, 2003), 125. In 1139 Patriarch William was displeased by the actions of Archbishop Fulcher of Tyre (of Angoul√™me), who travelled to Rome to receive his pallium from the Pope and protest the division of his archdiocese into two ecclesiastical territories: the northern suffragans were under the authority of the Patriarch and only the southern sees remained under Fulcher's control. Perhaps fearing that Fulcher would try to remove his entire archdiocese to the Principality of Antioch (so that he might exercise control over it all as Archbishop), William took direct control over the southern sees of Tyre in Fulcher's absence,William of Tyre, \\"A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea\\", Vol. I, Bk. 14, Ch. 11-13 for William would not allow the archbishop of Tyre, whose archdiocese lay within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and his patriarchate, to become the subject of another.Jean Richard, \\"The Political and Ecclesiastical Organization of the Crusader States\\", A History of the Crusades, V: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985), 240‚Äì41.

The son of Ernest and Felicia Puente, native Puerto Ricans living in New York City's Spanish Harlem, Puente is often credited as \\"The Musical Pope\\", \\"El Rey de los Timbales\\" (The King of the Timbales) and \\"The King of Latin Music\\". He is best known for dance-oriented mambo and Latin jazz compositions that endured over a 50-year career. He and his music appear in many films such as The Mambo Kings and Fernando Trueba's Calle 54. He guest-starred on several television shows, including Sesame Street and The Simpsons two-part episode \\"Who Shot Mr. Burns?\\". His most famous song is \\"Oye Como Va\\". Early life Tito Puente was born on April 20, 1923, at Harlem Hospital Center in the New York borough of Manhattan. His family moved frequently, but he spent the majority of his childhood in the Spanish Harlem area of the city. Puente's father was the foreman at a razorblade factory. As a child, he was described as hyperactive, and after neighbors complained of hearing seven-year-old Puente beating on pots and window frames, his mother sent him to 25-cent piano lessons. He switched to percussion by the age of 10, drawing influence from jazz drummer Gene Krupa. He later created a song-and-dance duo with his sister Anna in the 1930s and intended to become a dancer, but an ankle tendon injury prevented him pursuing dance as a career. When the drummer in Machito's band was drafted to the army, Puente subsequently took his place. Career Puente served in the Navy for three years during World War II after being drafted in 1942. He was discharged with a Presidential Unit Citation for serving in nine battles on the escort carrier USS Santee (CVE-29). The GI Bill allowed him to study music at Juilliard School of Music, where he completed a formal education in conducting, orchestration and theory. During the 1950s, Puente was at the height of his popularity, and helped to bring Afro-Cuban and Caribbean sounds like mambo, son, and cha-cha-ch√°, to mainstream audiences. Puente was so successful playing popular Afro-Cuban rhythms that many people mistakenly identify him as Cuban. Dance Mania, possibly Puente's most well known album, was released in 1958. Among his most famous compositions are mambo \\"Oye como va\\" (1963), popularized by Latin rock musician Carlos Santana and later interpreted, among others, by Julio Iglesias, Irakere and Celia Cruz. In 1969, he received the key to the City of New York from former Mayor John Lindsay. In 1992, he was inducted into the National Congressional Record, and in 1993 he received the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal from the Smithsonian. Puente's timbales in the Tito Puente exhibit in the Artist Gallery of the Musical Instrument Museum of Phoenix In early 2000, Tito Puente appeared in the music documentary Calle 54.Calle 54; Video Commentary After a show in Puerto Rico on May 31, 2000, he suffered a massive heart attack and was flown to New York City for surgery to repair a heart valve, but complications developed and he died on June 1, 2000 at 2:27am. He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003. Tito Puente's name is often mentioned in a television production called La Epoca, a film about the Palladium era in New York, Afro-Cuban music and rhythms, mambo and salsa as dances and music and much more. The film discusses many of Puente's, as well as Arsenio Rodr√≠guez's, contributions, and features interviews with some of the musicians Puente recorded with Alfonso \\"El Panameno\\" Joseph. Puente's son Richard \\"Richie\\" Puente was the percussionist in the 1970s funk band Foxy. Puente's youngest son, Tito Puente Jr., has continued his father's legacy by presenting many of the same songs in his performances and recordings, while daughter Audrey Puente is a television meteorologist for WNYW and WWOR-TV in New York City.

In the shows, Puente joins Springfield Elementary School as a music teacher after the school discovers it is located over an oil well. However, Mr. Burns manages to pump the oil first which makes him the legal owner of the well. This causes the school to fall into debt with budget cuts required to the music and maintenance departments, causing Puente to lose his job. When Burns is later shot, Puente becomes one of the prime suspects but manages to clear himself by performing one of his songs for Chief Wiggum. Seven alternative endings were filmed of various characters shooting Burns; Puente is one of the alternates. Although all endings were filmed, the ending of Maggie Simpson shooting Burns was the ending chosen to air. The Emmy-nominated song \\"Se√±or Burns\\" from the episode is featured on the 1999 album, Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons.

They make a distinctive hissing sound when calling. Adult members of the genus usually face downwards on tree branches, and lay their eggs in living tissue. The genus was originally described by Carl St√•l. The type species is Abricta brunnea from Mauritius and Reunion. However, recent review of the genus has shown it to be a disparate group of species, and the Australian members moved to other genera. S.M. Moulds conducted a morphological analysis of the genus and found the cicadas split naturally into clades according to biogeographical region. Of the 15 Australian species, the floury baker was the earliest offshoot. Unpublished data confirmed it was quite genetically distant from the other 14 species and so it was classified in a new monotypic genus Aleeta, while the others were placed in the genus Tryella. The genus has now been restricted to two species found in the region of Mauritius and surrounds.

They were formed as a result of local government reforms in 1989. There are 53 districts in New Zealand, and they do not include the 12 city councils, Auckland Council, or Chatham Islands Council. District councils serve a combination of rural and urban communities, while city councils administer the larger urban areas. Three districts (Gisborne, Tasman and Marlborough) are unitary authorities also performing the functions of a regional council. Districts are not subdivisions of regions, and some of them fall within more than one region. Taupo District has the distinction of straddling the boundaries of four different regions. Regional council areas are based on water catchment areas, whereas district council areas are based on community of interest and road access. Regional councils are responsible for the administration of many environmental and public transport matters, while the district councils administer local roads and reserves, sewerage, building consents, the land use and subdivision aspects of resource management, and other local matters.

It is being set up jointly by TIDCO and Larsen & Toubro (L&T;) in two phases. L&T; shipbuilding Kattupalli is a minor port. Adani ports and special economic zone (APSEZ) acquired kattupalli port from L&T; in June 2018 and renamed it as Adani Katupalli Port Private Limited (AKPPL). In terms of cargo generation, the terminal is located close to the majority of Container Freight stations in Chennai. The Kattupalli development also includes a shipyard being developed by L&T;, a private sector‚Äìbacked development. It is planning to compete with Japanese and Korean shipyards in building \\"specialised ships,\\" such as large-size warships, car carriers, submarines, naval offshore patrol vessels, fast patrol vessels and corvettes. After Colombo and Singapore, Kattupalli will be the third major international destination for ship repairs in the region.L&T; not to compete with Chinese shipyards The shipyard-cum- minor port complex was officially inaugurated on 30 January 2013. Structure The first development phase, which aims to be operational by January 2012, will have a 1.2 million TEU capacity through two 350-metre-long L-shaped berths and a total terminal area of around 20 hectares. The berths would be operated by the Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services Inc for 28 years. The terminal has an option to rise to 1.8 million TEU capacity during the second phase of development. Six ZPMC super-post- panamax, twin-lift, gantries are to be installed and 15 Noell one over five, 6+1 width RTGs supported by a state-of the-art terminal management system. All the equipment is of a higher-end specification. Mobile equipment will include two reach stackers and one empty handler. The yard will offer 5,000 ground slots and a CFS is also planned as part of the service package. Access to the terminal on the marine side is via a 3.5 km-long channel and port basin offering a draft of 14 m‚Äîthe draft capability is such that it provides for projected increases in southern Asian container trade. It also provides for the future possibility of mainline Asia‚ÄìEurope vessels making a stop in southern India, which has been mooted as a distinct possibility by certain analysts. Kattupalli's North and South breakwaters, which together total 3.35 km, ensure a safe harbour and uninterrupted terminal operations. The yard has 3 rail-mounted quayside cranes (RMQCs) (arrived at the port in December 2011 from China), 15 rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGCs), two reach stackers and 420 reefer plug points. On 12 April 2012, the yard received Zhen Hua 20, a heavy lift vessel, with three more RMQCs to be installed at the second berth. Engineering components hub When fully completed, it will be the largest shipyard in Asia. Once operational, the shipyard will become a nucleus for heavy engineering industry (fabrications and components manufacturing). This would make Chennai a hub for engineering components. The project is being implemented in two phases with a total investment of about 46,750 million. 30,500 million will be invested in Phase I (2009‚Äì11), and the rest in Phase II (2012‚Äì15). MoU has been signed and the project has commenced.http://www.tidco.com/images/shipyard.pdf Rail corridor As of October 2019, a 6.08-km rail corridor to ferry cargo to the port is being built at a cost of 518 million on a 31.175 hectare area. Proposed facilities The Kattupalli yard is mainly built for making warships and to augment the existing capacity at Hazira in Gujarat for sub-marines. A draft of up to 14 m and a waterfront exceeding 2.2 km makes the facility well suited to building large defence ships.L&T;'s shipyard in TN near ready; waits for Defence orders The Integrated shipyard complex will have the following facilities: #Commercial ship building including very large cargo carriers; specialized cargo ships for liquid/gas transportation and cruise vessels #Building of defense ships including submarines # Off-shore platforms and floating production-cum-storage facility for oil and gas sector #Refitting and re-engineering of commercial and defence ships #Heavy engineering fabrication and components production for ship building. At the yard, encompassing 1,250 acres,L&T; set to partner Hindustan Shipyard L&T; has also commissioned facilities to build offshore platforms, drilling rigs and FPSOs (floating production, storage and offloading unit), besides a minor port which can handle container ships.

Early life Born in the Polish region of Galicia in 1912, immigrated to the United States in 1929. He worked a range of temporary jobs during the Great Depression, became committed to Communist Party activism. His serious efforts at artistic painting had already begun during this time. Talented as a draftsman despite the fact that he had not yet enjoyed any formal training in the painter's craft, he would eventually receive informal art training from the urban scene printmaker Philip Reismana relationship which would continue until after the close of World War II.Hapke, Laura. Sweatshop: The History of an American Idea. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 2004. , . Pp. 83-88. Reismann (1904-1992) was a Polish-born American Jewish who studied at the Art Students League of New York and later participated at the Federal Art Project. Salamin's artistic leanings during the Depression era also permitted some work as an artist for the Works Progress Administration. Its end during the war years meant that social realism was now officially disfavored: canvases were thrown away and even burned according to the dictates of the United States government. Among socially minded artists, self-censorship emerged as a response to the \\"patriotic\\" requirements as a compromise during the period of World War II. A leftist who supported the war as a struggle against fascism in Europe, Salamin would return to his politically minded art following the war, only to be caught up in an unprecedented wave of anti- communism during the Second Red Scare period.  Controversies  Still obscure, Salamin was faced with political persecution against himself as a communist after the passage of the anti-communist provisions of the 1947 Taft- Hartley Act and his efforts at organizing machinists in the Brooklyn Navy Yard during the 1940s invited political persecution from the American government. Salamin's work in the garment industry, immune to some of the attacks against communist activists in various other spheres of American industry, afforded a measure of protection from the country's creeping McCarthyism.Keeran, Roger. \\"Marxist Center Art Sale to Feature Work of Eugene Salamin\\". People's Weekly World. April 2000. Retrieved 12 August 2009. As a mode of political expression, his art conflicted with American mores of the 1950s, and he would become an \\"underground artist\\" while working a day job at a clothing store sweatshop in New York City's Brooklyn borough and the Upper West Side neighborhood, depicting the \\"dystopian sweatshop\\" works for which his career has been most recognized. Retiring from manual work in New York in 1973, he described the \\"wonderful feeling\\" of being able to emerge as an artist working full-time. Salamin continued working into the 2000s (decade) and donated 25 of his works to the Communist Party's reference center in the 1990s. He settled in California during his last years.  Personal life  Salamin died on April 1, 2009, nearly 97 years of age.

Plot In late 1944, as the end of World War II approaches, the Wehrmacht's high command determines to pull out General Alexander L√∂hr's Army Group E from the Balkans back to Germany. They plan to supply the tank columns with fuel from a depot in Sarajevo. The Yugoslav partisans' leader in the city, a mysterious man known as Walter, presents a grave danger to the operation's success, and the Germans dispatch Standartenf√ºhrer von Dietrich of the SD to deal with him. As no one in the city seems to know what Walter even looks like, Dietrich manages to have an operative infiltrate the resistance under the guise of Walter himself. The partisans are caught in a deadly game of betrayal, fraud and imposture while trying to frustrate the Germans' plans. Iconic ending At the end of the movie, von Dietrich muses that he has finally realised why he never managed to defeat his nemesis Walter; standing on a hill he points at Sarajevo below and remarks in German: Sehen Sie diese Stadt? Das ist Walter! (\\"You see that city? That's Walter!\\") This was intended to send a message of unity consistent with the official politics of the multi-ethnic state of Yugoslavia.

Harkins (November 17, 1845 - May 25, 1921) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the second Bishop of Providence from 1887 until his death in 1921. Biography Matthew A. Harkins was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Patrick Harkins, an Irish immigrant, and his wife, Margaret. He received his early education at a primary school on Tremont Street and a grammar school in Quincy. He attended Boston Latin School from 1859‚Äì62, when he entered Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts. After a year at Holy Cross, he went abroad to France and furthered his studies at the English College, Douai and at √âglise Saint-Sulpice, Paris. While in Paris, Harkins was ordained to the priesthood on May 22, 1869.\\"Rt. Rev. Matthew Harkins, D.D.\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence After studying theology and canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, he returned to Massachusetts in 1870 and was named curate at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Salem (now part of the parish of Mary, Queen of apostles).Mary, Queen of Apostles He served as pastor of St. Malachi Church, Arlington, MassachusettsCutter, Benjamin and Cutter, William Richard. History of the Town of Arlington, Massachusetts, D. Clapp & Son, 1880, p. 179 from 1876‚Äì84, and then as pastor of St. James Church in Boston (then the largest parish in New England) from 1884-87. In 1884 he accompanied Archbishop John Joseph Williams to the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore as a theologian. On February 11, 1887, Harkins was appointed the second Bishop of Providence, Rhode Island, by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following April 14 from Archbishop Williams, with Bishops Patrick O'Reilly and Lawrence McMahon serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of SS Peter and Paul. During his tenure, the diocese grew to be among the largest in the country and to have one of the highest percentage of Catholics. In 1904 the Holy See formed the Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, out of Providence, which was then left 190,000 Catholics and which later increased to 275,180 by 1920. He increased the number of parishes from 39 to 95; most of these new parishes were erected in the cities and growing suburbs, and designated for various ethnic groups. He established numerous charitable organizations and parochial schools as well. He was responsible for creating the first Roman Catholic college in the diocese, Providence College, in 1917. Its main building, Bishop Harkins Hall, is named for him. Last years Due to his advancing age and declining health, Harkins received two auxiliary bishops between May 1914 and October 1917, and a coadjutor bishop in April 1919. He later died at age 75.

Dominant chords  In music theory, the dominant triad is a major chord, symbolized by the Roman numeral \\"V\\" in the major scale. In the natural minor scale, the triad is a minor chord, denoted by \\"v\\". However, in a minor key, the seventh scale degree is often raised by a half step ( to ), creating a major chord.

The dominant key is the key whose tonic is a perfect fifth above (or a perfect fourth below) the tonic of the main key of the piece. Put another way, it is the key whose tonic is the dominant scale degree in the main key. If, for example, a piece is written in the key of C major, then the tonic key is C major and the dominant key is G major since G is the dominant note in C major.

In non-Western music  The dominant is an important concept in Middle Eastern music. In the Persian Dastgah, Arabic maqam and the Turkish makam, scales are made up of trichords, tetrachords, and pentachords (each called a jins in Arabic) with the tonic of a maqam being the lowest note of the lower jins and the dominant being that of the upper jins. The dominant of a maqam is not always the fifth, however; for example, in Kurdish music and Bayati, the dominant is the fourth, and in maqam Saba, the dominant is the minor third.

First published in 1841, it forms part of his Sc√®nes de la vie de province. The action of the novel takes place in Nemours, though with flashbacks to Paris. It is set in the years 1829‚Äì1837.  Plot summary  Ursule is the legitimate daughter of the widower Dr Denis Minoret‚Äôs deceased illegitimate brother-in-law by marriage, Joseph Mirou√´t; not only is she the doctor‚Äôs niece, she is also his goddaughter and ward. Fifteen years old when the novel begins, she has been brought up by the doctor. Dr Minoret, an atheist rather than an agnostic, and a devoted student of the Encyclop√©die, has persisted in his rationalistic atheism for most of his eighty-three years. At the beginning of the novel he is, however, converted to Christianity ‚Äì emotionally by the example of Ursule‚Äôs piety, and intellectually by his experience of animal magnetism, or the paranormal, and by his longstanding friendship with Abb√© Chaperon. Dr Minoret is determined that Ursule shall inherit all the savings he has accumulated during his lifetime. He intends, on the other hand, to bequeath the remainder (approximately half) of his total fortune of about 1,500,000 francs to his ‚Äúh√©ritiers‚Äù, nephews and cousins of his own bloodline who are members of the Minoret, Cr√©mi√®re and Massin families. Discontented with their inheritance prospects, the ‚Äúheirs‚Äù seek to grab the whole of their wealthy relative's fortune, enlisting the help of the notary's clerk Goupil. The doctor conceals a letter of testamentary intention in a legal volume in his library. This, together with three bearer bonds, is stolen by one of the doctor's nephews, the postmaster Fran√ßois Minoret-Levrault, who, in the era before railways, owns and manages the carriage and postchaise services in and out of Nemours. The doctor dies, leaving Ursule much poorer than he had intended, for her inheritance would have become her dowry. Despite their best efforts ‚Äì ransacking all the books in his library ‚Äì the ‚Äúheirs‚Äù (or ‚Äúfamily‚Äù) cannot find the clue to the money. But remorse strikes Minoret-Levrault, and the doctor, appearing to him in a vision, instructs him to make good his theft. By an act of poetic justice the postmaster's dandyish son D√©sir√© Minoret-Levrault is killed in a stagecoach accident. Ursule marries the man of her dreams, the young Army officer Viscount Savinien de Portendu√®re.  Fundamental themes of the work  Virtue Ursule is conspicuously virtuous, and Balzac was acutely aware of the difficulty of presenting a virtuous heroine in a novel. ‚ÄúGoodness has just one form, evil has a thousand‚Äù, he believed:Honor√© de Balzac, Trait√© de la Vie √©l√©gante [Treatise on Fashionable Life, 1830], La Com√©die humaine, vol. XII, 1981, p. 237. ‚Äúto be able to portray many virgins, you need to be like Raphael‚ÄùHonor√© de Balzac, Avant-Propos [Foreword, 1842], La Com√©die humaine, vol. I, 1976, p. 17. He hoped that Ursule Mirou√´t would win the annual Prix Montyon for the book which had rendered the greatest service to mankind; but in this he was disappointed. According to Balzac in his Avant-propos (Foreword) to La Com√©die humaine, it is in capital cities that ‚Äúthe extremes of good and evil are to be found‚Äù.Honor√© de Balzac, Avant-Propos [Foreword, 1842], La Com√©die humaine, vol. I, 1976, p. 18. However, the extreme polarization of good and evil in this novel is to be found in the provinces. Inheritance and the Law Ursule Mirou√´t is the second of Balzac's four inheritance novels (i.e., Eug√©nie Grandet, Ursule Mirou√´t, La Rabouilleuse and Le Cousin Pons). As in all of the first three of these novels, the struggle for the inheritance is played out in a provincial town. In no other inheritance novel of La Com√©die humaine are the complexities of French inheritance law so coolly and analytically explored, and never more so than when the notary's clerk Goupil explains the inheritance situation to the ‚Äúheirs‚Äù. Legally speaking, Ursule Mirou√´t is no relation whatever of Dr Minoret: this is in stark contrast to the emotional situation, where she is everything to him! There is therefore no possibility that Ursule could obtain the whole of Dr Minoret's wealth ‚Äì unless, at nineteen years of age, she were to marry the eighty-seven-year-old doctor, which, as he is neither a blood relation of hers nor any sort of relation in law, he could legally do: and this is what the ‚Äúheirs‚Äù fear. Dr Minoret is moved by a profound sense of natural justice. For this reason he rules out any thought of a marriage of convenience with Ursule. And it is implied by Balzac that this sense of natural justice was just as strong within him in the days when he was an atheist. Furthermore, though the law can be manipulated by calculating people for their own self-advancement, it does roughly approximate to justice. D√©sir√© Minoret-Levrault, a lawyer himself, realizes this. Balzac, in Ursule Mirou√´t,Honor√© de Balzac, La Com√©die humaine, vol. III, 1976, p. 948. seems to be of the opinion that justice ‚Äúhas a power of omniscience, a collective memory and a capacity for eventual action which far transcend the law‚Äôs imperfect machinery‚ÄùDonald Adamson, Ursule Mirou√´t, Penguin Classics (Harmondsworth: 1976), p. 10. ‚Äì though allowance should be made for free indirect discourse. Nowhere else in La Com√©die humaine is this opinion so categorically stated. The Supernatural Ursule Mirou√´t embodies important philosophical statements of Balzac's view of life, in particular his belief in Mesmer‚Äôs theory of animal magnetism. Through Dr Minoret's experience of the occult, his s√©ance with the mysterious hypnotist and the elderly female medium, he becomes a Christian believer: here in La Com√©die humaine the finite is seen as being embedded within the infinite; animal magnetism underpins a belief in God. Balzac views Dr Minoret's rejection of religious indifference as the necessary accompaniment of his rejection of his earlier denial of animal magnetism.Honor√© de Balzac, La Com√©die humaine, vol. III, 1976, p. 837. Not only is Dr Minoret converted to Christianity by a s√©ance, he also makes five dream-like appearances from the dead; and the supernatural also seems to intervene in the fatal accident that befalls D√©sir√© Minoret-Levrault. It is because of this supernatural, cosmic dimension that ‚Äì very unusually for Balzac's novels ‚Äì Ursule Mirou√´t has a happy ending. It is one of the most joyful of his novels.  Narrative strategies  (1) The novel is notable for its use of the in medias res technique. Opening with Fran√ßois Minoret-Levrault anxiously awaiting his son D√©sir√©'s return home, it then turns to the circumstances leading up to that moment. (2) There is in fact a double employment of this flashback technique as shortly afterwards, to the town's amazement, Dr Minoret is shown walking to church with Ursule. The novel then proceeds to outline Dr Minoret's life up to that point. (3) The influence of the roman-feuilleton (serial (literature)) is very noticeable. Leading feuilletonistes were Eug√®ne Sue, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Paul F√©val, p√®re, Fr√©d√©ric Souli√© and Eug√®ne Scribe. Balzac became increasingly preoccupied by their popularity in the 1840s and tried to emulate them. This involved incorporating many features of melodrama; thus, for example, the s√©ance is high melodrama. Serialization also encouraged the ending of each serialized extract on a note of high suspense. (4) There is a strong ludic element in Ursule Mirou√´t. For Goupil the law is nothing but a game the aim of which is to outwit and defeat one's opponents. Melodrama also has a ludic dimension as Balzac conjures into and out of existence the visionary beings who assist the progress of the plot. He thus juggles with the different levels of reality ‚Äì the normal and the paranormal ‚Äì as if he were playing with a kaleidoscope. At the level of language this juggling is mirrored in Goupil's puns and Mme Cr√©mi√®re's slips of the tongue. (5) The narrative of Ursule Mirou√´t is essentially simple in conception. It is, according to Donald Adamson, ‚Äúa story in which no violent collision between the characters [arises]‚Äù.Donald Adamson, Ursule Mirou√´t, Penguin Classics (Harmondsworth: 1976), p. 11. Flashbacks apart, Ursule Mirou√´t has a straightforward storyline, with no sub-plots. Nevertheless, because of the flashbacks, it is a work of great narrative intricacy. Thus, with its stagecoach element, D√©sir√© Minoret-Levrault's death strikingly parallels the opening scene of the novel.  Conclusion  Although Andr√© Gide regarded Ursule Mirou√´t as a fairly minor work by Balzac's standards,Andr√© Gide, Journal, 1889‚Äì1939, 1951, p. 714. Balzac himself described it as the masterpiece of all the studies of human society he had written up to that date.Honor√© de Balzac, Lettres √† Madame Hanska, vol. II, 1968, pp. 76‚Äì77; 1 May 1842. There is an air of serenity about this novel which La Com√©die humaine seldom achieves; and this despite the elements of melodrama and class conflict. The skirmishings to obtain the inheritance are admirably represented, as in a tableau, by the scene at the auction of Dr Minoret's belongings, where the ‚Äúheirs‚Äù tip upside down and shake every volume in his library in their efforts to find the missing fortune. This turmoil is in a sense the Romantic dimension of the novel. Yet the dominant tone of Ursule Mirou√´t is projected at the very outset of the work, when Balzac compares its Nemours setting to the beauty and simplicity of a seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting. Ursule Mirou√´t has that ‚Äúnoble simplicity, and ... tranquil greatness‚ÄùJohann Joachim Winckelmann, Gedanken √ºber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, Friedrichstadt: 1755, p. 24. which, in Winckelmann‚Äôs words, were the defining characteristics of Classicism.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 31, 1993. In the episode, the homicide squad works the night shift on a summer evening, but no calls come in, leaving the detectives to brood over their personal matters. The teleplay was written by Frank Pugliese based on a story he wrote along with executive producer Tom Fontana. It was directed by Michael Lehmann. \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" was originally intended to be the third episode of the season, but NBC programmers moved it to the end of the season because they felt its slow pace and lack of traditional action was inappropriate early in the series, when the show was trying to woo viewers. The broadcast schedule change led to some consistency and time-line errors, which Homicide producers addressed by adding the words \\"One hot night, last September...\\" to the beginning of the episode. Actress N'Bushe Wright makes a guest appearance as a cleaning woman who loses her baby in the police station. Since ratings for Homicide had gradually declined throughout the season, NBC announced a decision about whether the series would be renewed would depend on the Nielsen ratings of the final four episodes, including \\"Night of the Dead Living\\". Nevertheless, it was seen by 6.7 million household viewers, marking one of the lowest viewerships of the season. It received generally positive reviews upon its original broadcast, although some mainstream television audiences were turned off by its minimalist approach. It marked the last original episode of Homicide for nine months until the second season premiere, \\"Bop Gun\\". The episode's teleplay won a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Television Writing for Episodic Drama. Plot summary The episode begins with an unknown person lighting a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance to complain about the non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who turns out to be a 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives. The detectives are shocked at the lack of homicide-related calls they are receiving throughout the night. Bolander (Ned Beatty) tries several times throughout the night to call Medical Examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes) and ask her out on a date, but he cannot build up the courage. With encouragement from Howard (Melissa Leo), he finally asks Blythe out and is shocked when she accepts. Crosetti (Jon Polito) gets agitated when his daughter calls and wants her boyfriend to sleep over. Gee comforts Crosetti and lets him go home to take care of her. Gee finds a baby boy in a small animal carrier-like cage on the bottom floor of the police department. The baby is very popular with the detectives, who take care of him while they wait for social services to arrive. After the social services worker takes the baby, the cleaning lady Loretta Kenyatta (N'Bushe Wright) hysterically screams somebody kidnapped her baby. The detectives get the baby back for her while Bayliss, infatuated with Loretta, listens to her talk about her life. Howard gets a call from her sister, who has recently found a tumor on her breast. The sister has just learned her husband has been having an affair. Although Howard is initially hesitant to confide in Felton, he eventually surprises her by offering genuine words of comfort. A drunken man dressed as Santa Claus (Cleve Wall) is arrested for threatening his wife and a crowd of people with a water pistol. Later, the detectives get a call that Santa Claus has escaped from custody in the department, and he is found after falling through the ceiling and landing on Munch's desk. Meanwhile, Pembleton and Bayliss discuss the Watson murder scene. Bayliss insists he has already gone over the information repeatedly, but Pembleton tells him he needs to think outside the box and approach it with from the mind-frame of a criminal. Later, Bayliss reexamines the information and realizes the killer brought Watson down a fire escape, offering a new lead in the case. As the new day dawns, Gee has the detectives assemble on the roof so he can spray them with a garden hose to cool them off. The episode ends with Munch revealing to Thormann that he lights the candle each night \\"for all the ones who have been killed,\\" while Thormann admits that he re-lit it in Munch's absence because he knew it meant something to him. Production \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" was directed by Michael Lehmann. The teleplay was written by Frank Pugliese based on a story he wrote along with executive director Tom Fontana. It was originally intended to be the third episode of the first season, but NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run so early in the season. The episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacks the traditional action of a typical police series, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series was still trying to woo viewers. The programmers also preferred to end the series on the upbeat note of the final scenes in \\"Night of the Dead Living\\", which includes the detectives happily smiling and laughing on the roof of the police department building as Gee sprays them with a hose to relieve the summer heat. In contrast, the originally-planned season finale, \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", which Homicide producers felt had a sense of resolving season storylines, was a somber episode which ended with a sad image of Bolander quietly singing to himself at a bar over a beer.Kalat, p. 121 Running the episode out of sequence produced several notable continuity errors. For example, Bayliss and Pembleton are still working on the Adena Watson murder, which they had stopped investigating in the earlier episode \\"Three Men and Adena\\". Additionally, Officer Thormann is seen onscreen working and healthy, although he was blinded in the earlier episode \\"Son of a Gun\\" as a result of a gunshot wound to the head that forced him to leave the police department. These consistency errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words \\"One hot night, last September...\\" to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order. The Watson case depicted in the episode was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. During \\"Night of the Dead Living\\", Crosetti displays an overriding concern for the safety and welfare of his daughter Beatrice. After Crosetti was revealed to have killed himself in the third season episode \\"Crosetti\\", many viewers claimed suicide was unrealistic for his character based on his feelings about his daughter displayed in this episode. Beatrice is referred to only by name in \\"Night of the Dead Living\\", and would not appear onscreen until she grieved over her father's death in \\"Crosetti\\".Kalat, p. 123 While discussing the mysterious candle with Lewis in the episode, Felton said he generally solves cases with physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives. This insight into detective work is consistent with the conclusions Simon drew in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets, and reviewers have praised Homicide for its realism in portraying detective work from this perspective, which is in stark contrast to other typical police dramas. N'Bushe Wright, best known to this point for playing the student activist Claudia Bishop in the NBC drama series I'll Fly Away, made a guest appearance in \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" as the cleaning woman Loretta Kenyatta. Wright was cast in the role based on her performance in Zebrahead (1992), a drama film about an interracial romance. A number of songs play on radios in the squad room throughout \\"Night of the Dead Living\\". Among the music featured in the episode were the songs \\"Lay Down My Life\\" by Carole King, \\"Texas Slide\\" by Jean-Jacques Milteau, \\"N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)\\" by Charles & Eddie, \\"Little Boy Blues\\" and \\"Break Up\\" by Gary Fitzgerald, and \\"Tropic Call\\" by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer. Ratings Ratings for Homicide: Life on the Street gradually declined since the series first premiered. In response, NBC announced to fans that a decision about whether Homicide would be renewed or canceled would depend on how the last four episodes of the season fared in the ratings, including \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\". In its original American broadcast on March 31, 1993, the episode was watched by 6.7 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode a 7.2 rating. It was one of the lowest ratings of the first season of Homicide: Life on the Street, continuing the downward trend of the season. By comparison, the previous episode, \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", was seen by 7.08 million households, while the season premiere, \\"Gone for Goode\\", was watched by more than 18 million households due to a lead-in from Super Bowl XXVII. Homicide ranked low in the Nielsen ratings compared to other shows the week of \\"Night of the Dead Living\\", while its time-slot competitor, the ABC comedy Home Improvement, ranked second for the week with 20.39 million household viewers. At the time that the season finale aired, Homicide producers still did not know whether their show would be renewed for a second season. After the season finale, Homicide: Life on the Street went on a hiatus while the network decided whether the series would be renewed. That hiatus ultimately lasted nine months until the premiere of the second season premiere, \\"Bop Gun\\". Reception The episode received generally positive reviews from commentators, although David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, said mainstream television audiences were \\"somewhat turned off by the minimalist approach\\". USA Today writer Matt Roush gave the episode four out of four stars, comparing it to David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross and calling it \\"minimalist drama (with) maximum impact\\". Roush wrote, \\"Imagine a crime show during which no crime occurs. Next to nothing happens. Yet every second counts.\\" Lon Grahnke of the Chicago Sun- Times also gave it four out of four stars. He wrote, \\"If Life on the Street winds up dead after tonight's episode - the victim of low Nielsen ratings - at least the nine superb actors in the squad will know they made a grand exit.\\" The Salt Lake Tribune writer Harold Schindler praised the episode, particularly the \\"excellent writing, great acting [and] super atmosphere\\". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders called the series \\"superb\\" and described Night of the Dead Living as \\"fascinating character studies of police officers in the squad room\\". In a 2007 article, Star Tribune writer Neal Justin included \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" in a list of 10 excellent network television episodes dating back 40 years. Justin said the episode proved it was not acting that made for good television, but rather strong writing and acting. Not all reviews were positive. John J. O'Connor of The New York Times praised the series in general, but said the various overlapping subplots in \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" - like the Santa Claus suspect, the pre-teen murder suspect and the cleaning woman's missing baby - felt like gratuitous \\"oddball routines\\". O'Connor added, \\"Too much cleverness can be grating.\\" Frank Pugliese and Tom Fontana won a Writers Guild of America award for Outstanding Achievement in Television Writing for Episodic Drama for the \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" teleplay. The script competed in that category against another Homicide episode, the first season premiere \\"Gone for Goode\\". The \\"Night of the Dead Living\\" teleplay also defeated scripts for the shows I'll Fly Away, Life Goes On, Picket Fences, TriBeCa and Reasonable Doubts. DVD release The first and second season episodes were included in the four-DVD box-set \\"Homicide: Life on the Street: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2\\", which was released by A&E; Home Video on May 27, 2003.

He was also the personal aide and a close friend to Montenegrin statesman Milo ƒêukanoviƒá. Due to his position as the national security adviser to Montenegrin president Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, ≈Ωugiƒá's May 2000 assassination in Podgorica sparked Balkan-wide reaction from political circles. The investigation carried out by the Montenegrin police never produced a suspect. In the years since, a lot of additional information and speculation has surfaced about his role in the Montenegrin state apparatus and alleged involvement in cigarette smuggling. Early life and career Born and raised in the northern Bosnian city of Tuzla to Montenegrin parents (father Vukola from ≈Ωabljak and mother Poleksija ƒêuroviƒá from a village near Danilovgrad) who worked as school teachers, ≈Ωugiƒá graduated from the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Law. In 1988 he found employment at SR Bosnia-Herzegovina's Secretariat of the Interior (SUP), before advancing to the position of sector chief at state security's Tuzla branch in 1991.Saƒçeku≈°a u kampanji bez milosti;Vreme, 10 June 2000 War soon broke out in Bosnia, and the ≈Ωugiƒá family, including 29-year-old Goran and his brother Igor, fled to Montenegro. Goran ≈Ωugiƒá's law enforcement career continued in the coastal town of Herceg Novi where in 1992 he became the assistant chief at the local police branch (Centar za javnu bezbjednost Herceg Novi). He soon got promoted to the main chief role. Following the 1995 turmoil at the Podgorica police branch that prompted removal of Interior Minister Nikola Pejakoviƒá, ≈Ωugiƒá got his next big promotion, moving up to capital Podgorica where he continued in the police chief role at the Centar bezbjednosti Podgorica. In addition to the capital city, the police branch ≈Ωugiƒá was now heading also had jurisdiction over the towns of Cetinje, Danilovgrad, and Kola≈°in. Once there, ≈Ωugiƒá, along with Montenegin police, was loyal to Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and remained so as the power struggle between ƒêukanoviƒá and president Momir Bulatoviƒá began. ≈Ωugiƒá had a key organizational role after ƒêukanoviƒá got inaugurated as the president of Montenegro following the controversial 1997 presidential elections and violent protests by Bulatoviƒá's loyalists in January 1998. For that, as well as for continued loyalty to ƒêukanoviƒá, ≈Ωugiƒá received the biggest career promotion when ƒêukanoviƒá named him as his national security adviser.≈†est hitaca u savetnika Mila ƒêukanoviƒáa, Glas javnosti, June 1, 2000 By now well connected and highly placed within the regime, ≈Ωugiƒá was said to wield a lot of power and influence on various matters going on in Montenegro at the time such as widespread cigarette smuggling. He was also said to be a close friend of controversial businessman and accused smuggler Stanko \\"Cane\\" Subotiƒá. Death On Wednesday night, May 31, 2000, past 23:00 CET, ≈Ωugiƒá parked his Audi A6 close to his apartment building at 7 Save Kovaƒçeviƒáa Boulevard in Podgorica. He got out of the vehicle and walked over towards the building entrance when he got approached from behind by a single person who killed him with a succession of shots to the head from an automatic weapon. ≈Ωugiƒá's assassination happened to occur at an extremely tense time in the relations of Montenegro and Serbia (federal units within FR Yugoslavia) with federal Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá (not supported by the West at the time and accused of war crimes by The Hague tribunal) and Montenegrin president ƒêukanoviƒá (openly supported by the West at the time) locked in an ongoing power struggle. It also came as the latest in a wave of assassinations of prominent mobsters and high political and politically connected figures in FR Yugoslavia (≈Ωugiƒá's was among the first to take place on the territory of Montenegro). It also happened to occur days before the June 11th local municipal elections in Herceg Novi and Podgorica. Reaction Press reaction Due to the tense political circumstances during which the murder occurred, some English-language Western media outlets like The Guardian and the Los Angeles Times were quick to indirectly point out a possible connection to similar events in Serbia at the time (Serbia was going through its own wave of assassinations in the first part of 2000). They went as far as to cautiously suggest ≈Ωugiƒá's assassination was an attempt by Belgrade to destabilize MontenegroKilling of president's aide shakes Montenegro, The Guardian, June 2, 2000 ahead of its first elections after the 78-day 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.Vote tests Milosevic support in Montenegro, The Guardian, June 9, 2000Montenegrin Advisor's Slaying Adds to Tension Ahead of Today's Vote, LA Times, June 11, 2000 Others, like the Italian Corriere della Sera went even further, saying that \\"Montenegro and Serbia have for months been at the edge of separation\\" and that \\"this tragic event brought the possibility of a compromise between them down to a minimum\\" before ominously exclaiming: \\"If another war flares up in the Balkans we will have known its start date in advance as well its detonator\\".‚ÄúKORIJERE DELA SERA‚Äù O UBISTVU ZUGICA, B92, June 2, 2000 Montenegrin official reaction The reaction of certain Montenegrin officials went along the similar dramatic lines. Speaking on the day after the assassination, President of the republic Milo ƒêukanoviƒá said: > \\"Whoever targeted Goran ≈Ωugiƒá committed a terrorist act against democracy in > Montenegro and against the security of Montenegrin citizens. And let me > deliver a message to those who might be happy about this crime that > Montenegro will not become hesitant nor discouraged from continuing with the > state policy that will guide the republic along the path of peace into the > company of developed European countries as a stable, democratic, and open > multiethnic society\\".UBIJEN DJUKANOVICEV SAVETNIK ZA BEZBEDNOST, B92, June > 1, 2000 Montenegirn Minister of Justice Dragan ≈†oƒá from the pro-Serbian People's Party was more restrained: \\"We are dealing with a murder like those we have seen outside Montenegro (namely in Serbia) and that is disturbing. I cannot give you any details because that would be speculating on motives\\". While leading pro-ƒêukanoviƒá regime Podgorica lawyer Ranko Vukotiƒá went the furthest, arguing that the killing was part of a \\"deliberate campaign\\" to destabilize Montenegro, presumably by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and his Montenegrin supporters. EU reaction Even EU foreign policy and security chief Javier Solana felt a need to react, \\"strongly condemning the, it is becoming increasingly obvious, politically motivated murder of high Montenegrin official Goran ≈Ωugiƒá\\". \\"EU condemns any attempt to undermine the reform process in Montenegro and to undermine the preparations for the upcoming local elections\\".SOLANA OSUDIO UBISTVO ZUGICA, B92, June 2, 2000 Belgrade's official reaction Milo≈°eviƒá's regime in Belgrade wasn't without reaction either with controversial Yugoslav federal Minister of Information Goran Matiƒá on June 6, 2000 directly accusing Montenegrin security officials Vuka≈°in Mara≈° and Darko \\"Beli\\" Raspopoviƒá of being involved in ≈Ωugiƒá's murder,Ubistvo na korzou, Vreme, January 11, 2001 which, according to Matiƒá, took place with CIA's organizational and logistical support.U.S. CIA Involved in Montegegrin Official's Murder, Official Says, Xinhua News Agency, June 7, 2000 At the same press-conference, Matiƒá accused CIA of having an \\"organized group for the logistical preparation of terrorist acts on FR Yugoslavia's territory\\". Matiƒá even named names, accusing James Schweigert (State Department's Balkans work group chief answering directly to James F. Dobbins, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs) of being the terrorist group's coordinator with Sean Berns (American office's chief in Dubrovnik) and Paul Davis (USAID worker in Dubrovnik) as his close accomplices.MATIC: CIA IMA GRUPU ZA PRIPREMU \\"TERORISTICKIH AKATA\\" NA TERITORIJI SRJ, B92, June 6, 2000 Funeral ≈Ωugiƒá was buried at Podgorica's ƒåepurci cemetery on Friday, June 2, 2000 with highest Montenegrin regime officials, including Milo ƒêukanoviƒá, Svetozar Maroviƒá, and, Filip Vujanoviƒá in attendance.SAHRANJEN GORAN ZUGIC, B92, June 2, 2000 The task of speaking for the regime went to its officials Miomir Mugo≈°a and Miodrag \\"Mi≈°ko\\" Vukoviƒá. Speaking about ≈Ωugiƒá, Mugo≈°a said: \\"He was brave and decisive when it came to defending Podgorica and the peace of its citizens, but wise when it came to controlling and calming the various divisions, so inherently traditional in our society... Thanks to him, our city had the reputation of being secure, and remained so. Nobody will make us tentative and indecisive, we refuse to become fearful and afraid of the criminal hand that gunned down Goran ≈Ωugiƒá while aiming at Podgorica and Montenegro, or any other such hand for that matter\\". Vukoviƒá added that \\"gunshots at Goran ≈Ωugiƒá are strikes at all of us who see Montenegro the same way he did; gunshots at him are strikes at Montenegrin democracy, at our future, at our joint living, humanly, and stately ideal\\".NIJE SE MIRIO SA NAMJERAMA BEZUMNIH DA CRNU GORU PONIZE Aftermath, speculation, and accusations Since the Montenegrin police never even produced a suspect, let alone arrest anyone in connection with ≈Ωugiƒá's assassination, the crime became a subject of rife public debate in the years since, especially in light of the fact that it turned out to be only the first in a series of assassinations of prominent individuals in Montenegro and those with ties to the tiny republic. Less than five months after ≈Ωugiƒá, Vanja Bokan, prominent alleged cigarette smuggler with connections to Montenegrin regime, was killed in Athens, Greece. In January 2001, ≈Ωugiƒá's police colleague Beli Raspopoviƒá was gunned down in broad daylight on a Podgorica street. Couple of months after that, Blagota \\"Baja\\" Sekuliƒá, another operative with ties to Montenegrin regime, was murdered in Budva. In another similarity to ≈Ωugiƒá's murder no suspects were produced for these murders nor was anyone arrested. 2001 Nacional affair In May 2001, ≈Ωugiƒá's name featured prominently in the series of articles on Stanko Subotiƒá and cigarette smuggling through Montenegro in Croatian weekly news magazine Nacional, all of which soon became known as the 'tobacco affair' or 'Nacional affair'.KAKO JE NACIONAL RAZOTKRIO SUBOTIƒÜA - Dossier: Duhanska mafija na Balkanu In the series' very first article written by journalist Jasna Babiƒá it was explicitly mentioned that ≈Ωugiƒá was murdered by Beli Raspopoviƒá.DUHANSKA MAFIJA - Glavni mafija≈°ki boss Balkana, Nacional, May 15, 2001 In the interview for the magazine couple of issues later, Sreƒáko Kestner, former Subotiƒá's aide who got into the cigarette smuggling business through Vanja Bokan, named ≈Ωugiƒá as an important cog in 'tobacco mafia': > \\"I met ≈Ωugiƒá not too long after Subotiƒá got into the business. At the time > ≈Ωugiƒá just got named to the post of Podgorica police chief. His units were > under direct orders from ƒêukanoviƒá, providing secure escort for trucks full > of cigarettes to make sure they safely leave Montenegro before entering > Serbia.

When his > political opponent Momir Bulatoviƒá called ƒêukanoviƒá out publicly on > television for having his campaign financed by a 'cigarette smuggler > Kestner', ƒêukanoviƒá responded that he never even met me, which was actually > true\\".Nacional razotkriva kako je djelovala najveƒáa balkanska mafija≈°ka > organizacija - Ispovijest Sreƒáka Kestnera, glavnog partnera Stanka Subotiƒáa > Caneta, Nacional, May 31, 2001 Ratko Kne≈æeviƒá's accusations in 2009 On August 12, 2009, in a lengthy letter to Belgrade high circulation daily Blic, former Montenegrin regime insider Ratko Kne≈æeviƒá who was the chief of Montenegrin trade mission in Washington, D.C. during the mid-1990s as well as another one of Milo ƒêukanoviƒá's close friends, gave a detailed account of the information he claims to know about the various assassinations in Montenegro in terms of who planned, ordered and committed them. It's been speculated before that Kne≈æeviƒá was the unnamed source for many of the claims in Nacional, however this was the first time he personally named names and talked directly about alleged crimes. Writing in response to Stanko Subotiƒá's denials of smuggling (that which Kne≈æeviƒá accused him of in July 2009 interviews to Blic, Vijesti, and NIN), Kne≈æeviƒá now wrote a letter to Blic accusing Subotiƒá, Jovica Stani≈°iƒá and ƒêukanoviƒá of ordering the murder of smuggler Vanja Bokan as far back as 1997 and originally getting Serbian mobster and state security operative ≈Ωeljko \\"Arkan\\" Ra≈ænatoviƒá to organize it. He also accused them of ordering and signing off on Radovan \\"Bad≈æa\\" Stojiƒçiƒá's assassination in April 1997, which according to Kne≈æeviƒá was organized and carried out by Beli Raspopoviƒá and his unit.Odgovor Ratka Kne≈æeviƒáa Stanku Subotiƒáu - Cane i Milo uklonili sve protivnike, Blic, August 12, 2009 Meanwhile, according to Kne≈æeviƒá, the preparations for Bokan's murder stalled because Arkan had more pressing concerns at the time so the logistical part of the job went to Goran ≈Ωugiƒá who in the meantime rose to be one of ƒêukanoviƒá's most trusted confidants and partners in cigarette smuggling while the immediate assassin job went to Baja Sekuliƒá - thus by 1999/2000, the Bokan murder was logistically planned out and prepared. However, according to Kne≈æeviƒá, this didn't sit well with Beli Raspopoviƒá who was by this time completely squeezed out of the cigarette smuggling profit sharing and furthermore saw ≈Ωugiƒá rise to the role he once occupied - regime's top security operative. Raspopovic thus, according to Kne≈æeviƒá, decided to strike and take out both ≈Ωugiƒá and Sekuliƒá. According to Kne≈æeviƒá, Raspopoviƒá managed to kill ≈Ωugiƒá but couldn't pull off the same with Sekuliƒá who in the meantime killed Bokan in Greece in October 2000 and later managed to eliminate Raspopoviƒá in Podgorica through a paid assassin brought in from Republika Srpska. Personal ≈Ωugiƒá was married to Nata≈°a who worked in the pharmaceutical industry. They have two children: son Andrej who was three years old at the time of his father's assassination and daughter Tara who was 11 months old.

The spring- and stream-fed lake is named for the long- billed curlew, Numenius americanus, that once frequented the area. The lake reaches a maximum of miles wide and includes four small islands. The average depth of the lake is deep with a maximum depth of reached in the northern area. Curlew Lake provides visitors and residents with opportunities for kayaking, boating, fishing, swimming, water skiing, canoeing, and sailing. Public access is available at Curlew Lake State Park at the lake's south end. The first elevation determinations for Ferry County establishing the water level of Curlew Lake were made from 1901 to 1903 by E. M. Fry and F.E. Fellows. The official elevation of the surface of Curlew Lake was recorded on May 13, 1901, as . In 1917 the Washington State legislature granted the Curlew Irrigation District the right to overflow the shore lands bordering the lake up to and including the high-water mark.Session Laws of the State of Washington, Fifteenth session 1917 Two years later a recommendation was made by the state game warden in 1919 that Curlew Lake be made into a reservoir for storing irrigation water. In 1926, with the construction of a dam at the north end of the lake, the water level was stabilized at an elevation , lower than the original 1901 determination. The lake hosts a number of native and introduced fish including Salvelinus fontinalis (brook trout), Salmo trutta (brown trout), Micropterus salmoides (largemouth bass), Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), Esox masquinongy X Esox lucius (tiger muskellunge), and Ptychocheilus oregonensis (squawfish). The tiger muskellunge, raised at the Columbia Basin Fish Hatchery in Moses Lake, were initially released into the lake in 1997 to control populations of squawfish. Several of the native mollusks found in the lake are now listed as species of concern. Anodonta californiensis commonly called the California floater is a species of mussel which was formerly found throughout Washington and in disjunct populations across the Western United States. The current Washington range is limited to Curlew Lake and three other locations. The severe reduction in range has resulted in the species' listing as a federal and state species of concern. The masked duskysnail (Lyogyrus) and Washington duskysnail (Amnicola), both undescribed species, are found in only two glacial kettle lakes in Washington, Fish Lake in Okanogan County and Curlew Lake. Believed to have formerly ranged in glacial lakes from the Cascades to the Rockies, the Washington duskysnail is now only found in one location outside of Washington, and both snails are limited to the two lakes in Washington. This isolated range has placed them on state and federal watchlists as critically imperiled species. Curlew Lake is one of several lakes in Eastern Washington to host a population of Euhrychiopsis lecontei (milfoil weevil) subsisting on the native milfoil species Myriophyllum sibiricum (northern milfoil).

Described as \\"a modest and unassuming youngster\\", he was selected to join Southampton's professional staff after a successful trial in August 1908.

Although he was a \\"solid, reliable performer at full back with a good turn of speed\\", he found first-team chances hard to come by, making only six appearances in his four years with the \\"Saints\\". The return of Dan Gordon in 1911 reduced his chances of regular football even further and in July 1912, the Saints accepted an offer of ¬£100 from Liverpool of the Football League First Division. On Merseyside, he again found few opportunities of first-team football and in three seasons at Anfield, his only Football League appearance came on 15 April 1914 when he replaced regular right-back Ephraim Longworth in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Manchester United.

So it was necessary to build a new mainline station to serve Casino. The new Casino railway station opened on 22 September 1930.North Coast Line NSWrail.net The station originally was an island platform. In October 1990, the eastern platform was decommissioned, later being filled in and redeveloped as a coach stop.\\"Signalling & Safeworking\\" Railway Digest December 1990 page 447 The Murwillumbah line branches off immediately North of the station, although it has not been used since 2004, the track is still in place and a short distance at Casino is used for occasional shunting movements. Casino had a locomotive depot with a roundhouse until it closed on 25 July 1986.\\"North Coast Report\\" Railway Digest October 1986 page 322 It reopened in 1996 when it was leased to Northern Rivers Railroad.\\"The Northern Rivers Railroad\\" Railway Digest December 1996 page 28 Platforms & services Casino has one platform with a passing loop. Each day the station is served by a northbound XPT service to Brisbane and a southbound service to Sydney. In addition a daily XPT to/from Sydney terminates at Casino. NSW TrainLink also operate coach services from the station to Tweed Heads, Robina, Surfers Paradise and Brisbane.

The label includes adult and children's wear, shoes, handbags, jewellery, beauty products, and bath items. Joe Fresh is available at over 300 Canadian supermarkets and superstores, in addition to standalone locations. Joe Fresh entered the U.S. market with permanent and pop-up stores in New York City and the surrounding region, with an international flagship store located at 510 Fifth Avenue. In 2012, the brand also appeared in approximately 680 J.C.Penney stores throughout the United States. The J.C.Penney agreement was dismantled in 2015, with the companies making the decision not to renew their existing distribution agreement, which expired on January 30, 2016. The Fifth Avenue store closed in 2015. History Inside a Joe Fresh store.  Concept  In 2004, Loblaw approached Joe Mimran, a co-founder of the Club Monaco retail chain and the name behind the Alfred Sung brand, with the idea of creating a new fashion line. Mimran had previously worked with Loblaw in developing its President's Choice Home Collection of merchandise. While the company had offered children's clothing in its superstores, it had never participated into the adult market. Mimran and Loblaw soon identified a market niche, namely fashionable-but-highly-affordable clothing. \\"Out of our discussion came the idea of style at an incredible price.\\" Much, though, was left to Mimran's intuitive sense of what would sell: > ... we had no idea what the consumer would want from a food store; we had no > idea whether the prices would resonate, whether they wanted casual dress > versus something dressier. Everything that was done at that time, we did it > really without very much research. We just said let's build a line, let's > design the stores, the marketing, the [rounded dollar] price points. We went > with bright colours and tasty colours because it was a food store, and all > of these things were all done intuitively, and it worked. Mimran noted that both \\"integrity of product design\\" and a \\"killer price point\\" were key, along with the practical considerations associated with selling a clothing line in a supermarket, since both the retail environment and merchandise \\"had to stand up to the wear and tear of shopping carts and the traffic flow.\\" Launch In March 2006, Joe Fresh Style debuted at forty Real Canadian Superstore and Atlantic Superstore locations. With \\"fresh classics and colours,\\" Joe took the \\"legwork out of everyday clothes shopping\\" by putting it in one convenient location. News reports described the launch as \\"a big gamble\\" for both the food retailer and designer. In fact, the branding represented the first time Mimran's name appeared on one of his labels. \\"Now, Mr. Mimran is finally being thrust into the public spotlight, becoming a brand in his own right.\\" The use of \\"Joe,\\" according to Mimran, was a very deliberate decision that gave the private label \\"instant credibility.\\" Meanwhile, \\"Fresh\\" not only drew an association with the supermarkets where the clothes would be sold but also the line's simple, clean aesthetic. Dubbed \\"cheap chic\\" by the media, Mimran insisted that, while chic, Joe Fresh was anything but cheap. \\"There is no doubt that we are offering superb quality for the price,\\" noting that \\"the clothes can be washed, they can be worn.\\" News reports also took note of the brand's philosophy of making things not only affordable but anything other than complex, whether in terms of coordinating individual items or the line's overall pricing strategy: > Joe Fresh is all about co-ordinated pieces, aimed at making it easy for > shoppers to mix and match a blazer, pants and top. The signs display the > prices in round numbers, shunning the strategy of knocking a penny off the > price to make it seem cheaper. One retail analyst expressed the view that consumers would be more likely to buy based on the line's style and in-store retail convenience rather than price point. Sales Seven months after the brand's launch, Loblaw reported that sales had exceeded the company's own projections. \\"Every one of our sales objectives that we have set, we have surpassed\\", noted Louise Drouin, senior vice president of general merchandise. Mimran also expressed his personal satisfaction with the brand's acceptance among consumers. \\"I've been involved with many projects over the years, and I can tell you the response to this has been overwhelming.\\" But retail consultant, Dalan Bronson of the J.C. Williams Group, while impressed with the Joe Fresh line, was more cautious, contending that the jury was still out on the brand's long-term prospects, given the fickle nature of the fashion trade. Product line In 2007, Loblaw began expanding the line to include sleepwear, lingerie, and children's wear, \\"and quickly became the top seller of kid's clothing in the country.\\" Swimwear and sunglasses were added in 2008, and in 2009 Joe Fresh Beauty debuted with an array of reasonably priced cosmetics, at $8 or less. By then, the brand had become the second-biggest-selling clothing label in the country, according to market research. A Maclean's magazine article noted Joe's appeal amongst a wide range of consumers: > Since its inception, Joe Fresh has been a smash hit with suburban soccer > moms. But experts have been a little surprised by how many young urbanites, > regulars at Holt Renfrew and other high-priced boutiques, are willing to > snap up $29 cable-knit sweaters and $49 skirts without the slightest hint of > shame. Many, in fact, openly boast to friends about their great finds. Within its first year and a half, Joe Fresh had chalked up $400 million in retail sales. As a believer in \\"vertical retailing,\\" Mimran typically oversees every stage in the Joe Fresh design, production, sales and marketing process ‚Äì in contrast to the traditional retailer, who buys wholesale and marks-up in order to make a profit. The end result is a product line branded under its own label, sold in its own retail outlets, and priced without reference to wholesale margins. Managing all aspects of the process not only allows Mimran to be competitive on pricing but also innovative in terms of design and manufacture: > In addition to peppy, nicely made, current-but-not-runway-slavish > sportswear, there are avant-garde signature pieces. The jewel of the fall > collection is a bell-shaped neoprene coat‚Äîin orange, naturally‚Äîinspired by a > vintage Balenciaga, which will retail for $99. Balenciaga, he explains, was > able to achieve antigravity shapes through the use of expensive, double- > weave fabrics that aren‚Äôt available anymore. \\"We first showed it in wool, > but the wool wasn't really capturing the shape. So I thought, why don't we > try neoprene?\\" he says. \\"It's like an art piece and sculptural and at the > same time, it's so brand correct.\\" According to Mimran, it's not only a matter of bringing more value to the end product, \\"you're also bringing an idea, a thumbprint to the consumer.\\" Expansion In 2010, Joe Fresh moved beyond the supermarket aisle with the opening of its first stand-alone store, located in downtown Vancouver. Months later, Loblaw announced its intent to open twenty dedicated outlets across Canada, six to be completed by year's end. Although media reports speculated that the brand would remain strictly a Canadian phenomenon, in 2011, Loblaw announced its most ambitious plans yet for Joe Freshfour retail outlets slated for metropolitan New York City with \\"an international flagship store\\" on Fifth Avenue. Mimran declared it the right move at the right time. \\"We felt it was time to make the first step into the international market with a store in the American fashion capital, and one of the most exciting cities in the world, New York.\\" But in confirming the brand's entry into the American market, Loblaw president Allan Leighton pointed out that it was \\"very much a pilot project.\\" One retail analyst, Kaileen Millard-Ruff of market researcher Synovate Canada, referred to the opportunities and pitfalls faced by Canadian retailers who head south of the border in hopes of staking a claim: > \\"Joe Fresh definitely has an opportunity there, and the U.S. is looking for > more cheap chic,\\" she said. \\"And the designs don't look cheap, they look > more sophisticated. It all comes down to whether Loblaw will put in the cash > to do it properly, because in New York you have to look like a big thing to > be a big thing ... that's everything on execution from the space, to > product, to fixtures, to lighting. Fifth Avenue is not the cheapest real > estate around.\\" But while Loblaw management was cautious in tone regarding Joe's entry into the American market, Mimran spoke ambitiously, envisioning as many as 800 stores across the U.S. in five years, with the possibility of taking the label beyond North America, into Europe and Asia. He noted that Joe Fresh already competes successfully with international brands at home in Canada. \\"Today, if you have a proposition that resonates, it can work across cultures and borders.\\" Mimran also expressed the view that considering the enormous sales volume of the brand in Canada, to not attempt an entry into the U.S. market and beyond would be a matter of \\"shortchanging ourselves.\\" New York In July 2011, New Yorkers were given a sneak preview of Joe Fresh fashion with the opening of a 600-square-foot pop-up summer store, replete with a wall display of brightly coloured flip-flops, at the Long Island resort of East Hampton Village. New York City's first glimpse of Joe followed in the fall with the October opening of a temporary \\"holiday store\\" on Madison Avenue. But it was with the unveiling of stores at Bridgewater New Jersey, and Garden City, New York, that Joe began ringing in sales at its first permanent U.S. outlets. New York City's first permanent Joe Fresh store, located in Manhattan's Flatiron District, opened in November 2011. Mimran, present for the grand opening of a new Joe Fresh boutique at 110 Fifth Avenue, acknowledged the crowded nature of the New York's low-price high fashion market, but contended there's always a place for a new player with integrity: > The fashion industry allows newcomers. This is not an exclusionary industry. > I think if you get beat it's not because of the competition, it's because > you are not good enough. Women do love to shop around and they like to have > a handful of brands that they like to frequent. It's not about one single > brand. This is not the computer business, it's the fashion game. There isn't > one department store, there isn't one specialty store. And what we've shown, > especially in Canada, is we can play with international competition. So why > can't we do it here? Joe's new international flagship headquarters, located on Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street, opened in the spring of 2012. The New York ad campaign featured the slogan, \\"Irresistible fashion for Everyone. Affordable fashion for Anyone.\\" In July 2012, it was announced that Joe Fresh and J.C. Penney were teaming up to open close to 700 Joe stores in the retailer's outlets throughout the United States. Mimran described the move as \\"akin to a roll-out but done very quickly\\" and noted that it would give Joe Fresh national exposure. March 2013 saw the launch of 681 Joe Fresh stores throughout J.C. Penney locations. The brand also became available online, featured on the J.C. Penney website. Issues On 24 April 2013, an eight-story commercial building called Rana Plaza collapsed in Savar, a sub-district near Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. At least 1,127 people died and over 2,438 were injured. The building housed a number of separate garment factories employing around 5,000 people, several shops, and a bank and manufactured apparel for brands including the Benetton Group, Joe Fresh,'Extreme Pricing' At What Cost?

The parent company of Joe Fresh, Loblaws, offered compensation to the victims of three months pay, totalling about $150 plus undisclosed long term compensation. It has established a $3 million trust to compensate victims of the accident. Joe Fresh continues to manufacture its garments in Bangladesh, with one source stating that as of 2014 it has doubled production in the country. In 2014, Loblaws finally hired an employee to oversee its Bangladeshi operations and monitor working conditions. In 2015, a class action lawsuit asking for $1.85 billon in damages was filed against Loblaws alleging Loblaws was aware of the poor safety standards of Rana Plaza.

This is particularly associated with residential and commercial mortgages, in which case it usually occurs after a substantial drop in the house's price such that the debt owed is (considerably) greater than the value of the property ‚Äî the property has negative equity or is underwater ‚Äî and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, such as following the bursting of a real estate bubble. Such borrowers are called walkaways. The process of strategically defaulting on a home mortgage has been colloquially called \\"jingle mail\\" ‚Äî metaphorically, one mails the keys to the bank.  Prevalence post-housing bubble  Economists Paul Krugman and Hal Varian argued that strategic default would be an inevitable result of the collapse of the finance and property bubble of the era following 2006. They also noted that this is one of the few ways of freeing people from the burden of mortgage debt. Once free of the mortgage, debtors are free to use their income for other expenditures. A study in September 2009 from the credit reporting agency Experian and consulting outfit Oliver Wyman estimated that close to a fifth of troubled mortgages in the U.S. involved borrowers who were strategically defaulting.  Effects  Effects vary by jurisdiction; different countries and different states in the United States treat default on mortgage debt differently, notably distinguishing whether it is recourse debt and non- recourse debt, meaning whether the mortgage lender can pursue claims against the defaulted debtor. Further, mortgage refinancing may be treated differently from an original, un-refinanced mortgage, and mortgages on second homes may be treated differently from mortgages on primary residences. The borrower after deciding to not make payments any more can live free of the costs of payment or rent until the lender forecloses, which may take from several months to years. A borrower may use this time to extinguish or negotiate other debt. Mortgage lenders may negotiate with defaulting borrowers to assure maintenance and occupancy of the property until the lender can take title and market the house, and may provide the defaulting borrower with greater than the minimum legal notice to quit (which can be as little as three days) and may even agree to pay a fee to leave the home in pristine condition. Foreclosure of the borrower's house will result in a negative entry on the borrower's credit rating, possibly making obtaining loans in the future more difficult or more expensive for the borrower. With otherwise good credit a new mortgage from US government agencies will be denied until 3 (FHA) to 7 years (FNMA) have passed since the actual date of foreclosure. The difference between the value of the property at the time of foreclosure and the amount of the note (assuming the note is larger) is considered by the IRS as \\"debt forgiven\\" and may be considered \\"income\\" subject to federal income tax. For a short period ending at the end of December 2012 due to the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, this \\"phantom income\\" was not subject to tax on primary residences. Ethical issues Some ethicists have questioned the morality of strategic default, arguing that one has a duty to make payments on debt if one is able. Others argue that there is no such moral duty, a loan being a contract between consenting adults, and noting that financial investors routinely default on non-recourse loans that have negative equity. Some argue further that there is a moral duty to strategically default, and that one should make such decisions based on one's financial interest \\"unclouded by unnecessary guilt or shame\\", as lenders who do not modify mortgages do the same, \\"seek[ing] to maximize profits or minimize losses irrespective of concerns of morality or social responsibility,\\" or more bluntly stating that \\"The economy is fundamentally amoral.\\" Further, obligations to honor a contract are balanced by obligations to oneself and one's family, the latter speaking in favor of strategic default, some arguing \\"You need to put yourself and your family's finances first,\\" while one also has obligations to a community, which may be damaged by default. Other jurisdictions In Europe, there are generally no pure nonrecourse debts for private persons. Therefore, they need to pay remaining debts even if leaving their houses. Because having a home to sleep in is prioritized, the house mortgage is usually prioritized, while other debts might be abandoned if they cannot be paid. Strategic bankruptcy of companies is however common in Europe.

It was first introduced in 1941 aboard their s, replacing the originally intended 14\\"/50 caliber Mark B guns and was also used for the follow-up South Dakota class. These battleships carried nine guns in three three-gun turrets. The gun was an improvement to the 16\\"/45 caliber guns used aboard the , and the predecessor to the 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun used aboard the . Description The 16 in/45 were improved versions of the Mark 5 guns mounted on the s, with their limit of a shell with a maximum range at their turret limit of 30-degree elevation. A major alteration from the older guns was the Mark 6's ability to fire a new armor-piercing (AP) shell developed by the Bureau of Ordnance. At full charge with a brand-new gun, the heavy shell would be expelled at a muzzle velocity of 2,300 feet per second (700 m/s); at a reduced charge, the same shell would be fired at 1,800 f/s (550 m/s). Barrel life‚Äîthe approximate number of rounds a gun could fire before needing to be relined or replaced‚Äîwas 395 shells when using AP, increasing to 2,860 for practice rounds. By comparison, the 12\\"/50 caliber Mark 8 gun of the large cruisers had a barrel life of 344 shots, while the 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun fitted in the s had a barrel life of 290 rounds.DiGiulian, Tony. \\"United States of America 16\\"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 7\\". Navweaps.com. 11 June 2017. Web. 14 June 2017. Turning at 4 degrees a second, each turret could train to 150 degrees on either side of the ship. The guns could be elevated to a maximum elevation of 45 degrees; turrets one and three could depress to ‚àí2 degrees, but due to its superfiring position, the guns on turret two could only depress to 0 degrees.DiGiulian, Tony. \\"United States of America 16\\"/45 (40.6 cm) Mark 6\\".

Maximum range was obtained at an elevation of 45 degrees. With the heavy AP shell the maximum range was , and with the lighter high capacity (HC) shell, . The guns weighed 192,310 lb (87,230 kg; 86 long tons) not including the breech; the turrets weighed slightly over 3,100,000 lb (1,410,000 kg; 1400 long tons). When firing the same shell, the 16 in/45 Mark 6 had a slight advantage over the 16 in/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor‚Äîa shell from a 45 cal gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45 cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2 degrees, as opposed to 36 degrees with the 50 cal. alt=The turret held three guns; below the gun deck were the turret floor, the machinery floor, and two levels of magazines for the shells and propellant charges. Two centrally located ammunition hoists carried the ordnance from the magazines to the gun deck. Shell The Mark 6 and 7 guns were originally intended to fire the relatively light (1.00 long ton) Mark 5 armor-piercing shell. However, the shell-handling system for these guns was redesigned to use the \\"super-heavy\\" APCBC (armor-piercing, capped, ballistic capped) Mark 8 shell before any of the s were laid down. The large- caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16-inch (406 mm) shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work, and a high- explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. The Mark 8 shells gave the North Carolina, South Dakota, and Iowa classes the second heaviest broadside of all battleship classes, despite the fact that the North Carolina and South Dakota ships were treaty battleships. Only the super dreadnoughts could throw more weight. The Mark 6's disadvantage relative to other contemporary battleship classes was its comparatively shorter range.\\"Battleship comparison\\".

Accessed July 12, 2009. Service history The Mark 6 16-inch gun holds several distinctions relating to the United States' World War II combat history. In the first instance, the battleship employed these 16\\"/45 caliber guns as her primary armament, and she is believed to have fired the United States' first and last 16-inch shells of World War II; the first use occurring on 8 November 1942 during the Naval Battle of Casablanca (shortly before the Naval battle of Guadalcanal), the last on 9 August 1945 off the coast of Hamamatsu, Japan. Furthermore, their use at Casablanca was the only time that a fast battleship of the US Navy fired its guns in anger in the European theater. In the second instance, as the primary armament of these guns were employed against the Imperial Japanese Navy's (a much older and less powerful ship, armed with 8 √ó 14-inch guns and originally built as a battlecruiser during World War I) during the Naval battle of Guadalcanal; this has been cited by historians as the only instance in World War II in which one American battleship actually sank an enemy battleship.. (While there was a battleship- versus-battleship engagement at Leyte Gulf, torpedoes rather than gunfire were largely regarded as being responsible for sinking the enemy battleships.) The Washington had the aid of a naval fire control computer‚Äîin this case the Ford Instrument Company Mark 8 Range Keeper analog computer used to direct the fire from the battleship's guns, taking into account several factors such as the speed of the targeted ship, the time it takes for a projectile to travel, and air resistance to the shells fired at a target. This gave the US Navy a major advantage in the Pacific War, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to a comparable level (although they did have complex mechanical ballistics computers, which had been in use since World War I). Washington was able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy, as was demonstrated in November 1942, when she engaged Kirishima at a range of at night. Using her nine 16\\"/45 caliber Mark 6 guns, Washington fired 75 rounds of 16-inch AP shells and scored an incredible twenty heavy-caliber hits that critically damaged the Kirishima, which eventually sank.Kirishima Damage Analysis by Robert Lundgren During the same battle, South Dakota also fired off several salvos from her 16\\"/45 guns before she had to withdraw for repairs to a faulty circuit breaker. Successor The next US Navy battleship class, the , did not fall under Treaty weight restrictions and allowed for additional displacement. However, in their original design, the General Board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of would only allow the addition of s over the South Dakotas. Rather than retaining the 16\\"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun used in the South Dakotas, they ordered that future studies would have to include the more powerful (but heavier) 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 2 guns left over from the canceled s and battleships of the early 1920s. It also allowed the draft of the ships to be increased, meaning that the ships could be shortened (lowering weight) and the power reduced (since a narrower beam reduces drag).Friedman, pp. 310‚Äì311. The Mark 2 50-caliber gun turret weighed some more than the Mark 6 45 caliber did; the barbette size also had to be increased so the total weight gain was about , putting the ship at a total of ‚Äîwell over the 45,000 long ton limit. An apparent savior appeared in a Bureau of Ordnance preliminary design for a turret that could carry the 50 caliber guns in a smaller barbette. This breakthrough was shown to the General Board as part of a series of designs on 2 June 1938.Friedman, p. 311. Nonetheless, the Mark 7 gun still weighed about 239,000 pounds (108 000 kg) without the breech, or 267,900 pounds with the breech, considerably heavier than the Mark 6. The Mark 7 had a greater maximum range over the Mark 6: vs . When firing the same conventional shell, the 16\\"/45 caliber Mark 6 gun used by the treaty battleships of the and es had a slight advantage over the 16\\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun on the , when hitting deck armor‚Äîa shell from a 45 cal gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45 cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2 degrees, as opposed to 36 degrees with the 50 cal.

During World War II, the Mark 7 guns were only used for shore bombardment in the Pacific, while the Mark 6 guns also saw ship-to-ship combat in both the Pacific and European theaters. This was attributed to the fact that ships mounting the Mark 7 batteries, the , were commissioned later than the Mark 6-equipped and es, so they missed the Naval Battles of Casablanca and the Guadalcanal, one of the few instances where the US Navy's fast battleships were deployed for ship-to-ship combat. Most large scale naval battles involving the US Navy were fought by carrier- based aircraft in the Pacific.

The battle began when the two torpedo boats were sent on a rescue mission and ran into a British patrol. The Germans fought with the patrolling trawlers until British destroyers from Harwich Force came to their aid and sank the vessels. The battle greatly demoralized the German flotilla at Flanders, as the boats that were sunk had been launched shortly before the battle. The action off Noordhinder Bank helped bring to the attention of the German high command that the Flanders Flotilla was inadequately armed to protect the coast it was assigned to defend, let alone harass British shipping in the English Channel. After similar defeats, the small torpedo boats such as those used off Noordhinder Bank were relegated to coastal patrol and heavier units were transferred to even the balance of power in the channel. Background After the 7th Torpedo Boat Half Flotilla was lost during the Battle off Texel, German naval authorities were reluctant to commit any further forces for offensive operations off the coast of Flanders. Despite this, the commander of Marine Corps Flanders‚ÄîAdmiral Ludwig von Schr√∂der‚Äîkept pressure on the German naval command for a transfer of a force of submarines and torpedo boats to his command. After several months, the (Imperial German Navy) relented and decided to send him a force of light torpedo boats and submarines. Although these forces were greatly inferior in armament and displacement to those he had requested, Admiral Schroeder put his new ships to use as soon as he received them. He formed the Flanders Torpedo Boat Flotilla made up of 15 \\"A\\"-class torpedo boats under the command of Hermann Schoemann. Three days later on 1 May 1915, two German seaplanes reported a squadron of four trawlers off Noordhinder Bank. One of the seaplanes was forced to make an emergency landing and Schoeman was dispatched with boats and to rescue the seaplane's crew and destroy the trawlers. While patrolling off the Galloper lightship near Goodwin Sands, was sunk by the German submarine UB-6. , Recruits consort as well as the four trawlers the German seaplanes had spotted, began searching for Recruits attacker. A2 and A6 caught the trawlers off the Noordhinder Bank at 15:00. The trawlers Columbia, Barbados, Chirsit and Miura were under the command of Lieutenant Sir James Domville on Barbados. Armed with a 3-pounder gun each, the trawlers were out-gunned by the German torpedo boats, both being armed with two torpedo tubes as well as a 4-pounder gun. Battle As soon as the trawlers were spotted by Schoeman's boats, they were engaged. Rather than flee, Domville tried to fight his way out. A2 and A6 both made torpedo runs against the trawlers but of the four torpedoes launched, only one hit its target, sinking Columbia and killing Domville. Barbados rammed A6, damaging it enough that the Germans decided to withdraw from the action. Before withdrawing, the Germans managed to rescue a lieutenant and two deckhands from Columbia making them prisoners of war. The trawlers had alerted Harwich Force and a squadron of four Laforey-class destroyers were dispatched to rescue the trawlers. , , and from Harwich Force sailed and managed to gain sight of the German boats soon after arriving on the scene. Equally out-gunned as the trawlers previous, the German boats attempted to make for the safety of the Flanders coast, pursued by the British destroyers. Once the British managed to catch up with the torpedo boats, they were engaged in a running fight that lasted nearly an hour. By the end, both torpedo boats were destroyed with many of the Germans, including the new commander of the Flanders Flotilla, going down with their ships, while the British destroyers had no casualties. Aftermath When the battle ended, British losses included Columbia sunk, Barbados damaged. Columbia suffered 16 dead, with only a deckhand being recovered after the action. The Germans lost A2 and A6 along with 13 men killed (including Schoemann) and 46 rescued and taken prisoner. Controversy erupted after it was discovered from the captured Germans that the three men taken from the sinking Columbia had been locked away below decks on one of the torpedo boats and left to die when the German vessel started to sink. The Germans reported that they did not have enough time to get to the British prisoners and barely were able to escape themselves. The battle showed Schroeder the severe limitations of the \\"A\\"-class torpedo boats; they were too poorly armed for raiding and the boats were relegated to coastal patrols. The defeat at Noordhinder allowed Schroeder's pleas for reinforcements finally to be heard by the German Admiralty and he was reinforced by heavier vessels. The next engagement involving an \\"A\\"-class torpedo boat reinforced the perception that the class was too weak for service and several new boats were put in reserve when larger and more capable boats were transferred to the Flanders Flotilla.

Peter Millward wrote their original material, and was guitarist, vocalist and all-round front-man. Martin Pavey played bass guitar, Tiffer Breakey, drums, and Gary Bryson tenor sax, harmonica and occasional vocals. HFD were formed in the crucible of a student musical appreciation society, set up originally to squeeze beer money out of the Student Union. However, the band quickly realised there was more money to be made taking their brand of anarchic indie rock to the masses. This proved to be a shrewd move, and the resulting 1 pound 75 pence was put towards a recording session which produced their first EP in the summer of 1980, Indian Summer.

Its chief engineer from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's controlling body, the Air Board, for a record seventeen years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of airworthiness. Commencing his service career as a Royal Australian Navy cadet during World War I, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to Papua New Guinea. Wackett became the RAAF's senior engineer with his appointment as Director of Technical Services in 1935. A wing commander at the outbreak of World War II, he rose to air commodore by 1942 and assumed the role of Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance. He established the Technical Branch as a separate department of the RAAF in 1948, and was promoted to air vice marshal the same year. Wackett served as Air Member for Technical Services until leaving the military in 1959, having been appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Companion of the Order of the Bath. From 1960 to 1968, he was a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission, parent of Trans Australia Airlines. Generally known as \\"Wack\\", or \\"EC\\" (to distinguish him from his elder brother, aircraft designer Lawrence James Wackett or \\"LJ\\"), his prominent chin and nose also earned him the nickname \\"Punch\\".Stephens and Isaacs, High Fliers, pp. 97‚Äì99 He died in 1984, aged 83. Early career Born on 13 August 1901 in Townsville, Queensland, Ellis Wackett was the third and youngest child of James, an English-born storekeeper, and Alice Wackett (n√©e Lawrence). Following schooling in Townsville, he entered the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay, New South Wales, in 1914, aged thirteen. Graduating in 1918, he served as a midshipman aboard the Royal Navy battleship HMS Monarch and battlecruiser , and later the RAN light cruiser HMAS Brisbane and battlecruiser HMAS Australia.Personnel file: Wackett, Ellis Charles at National Archives of Australia. Retrieved on 28 August 2009. He was commissioned a sub-lieutenant in January 1921, and posted to England for study in July.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 337‚Äì338 Wackett was at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham, when he applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1922.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 90‚Äì91 Accepted by the Air Force the following year, he finished at Keyham in August and trained as a pilot on Salisbury Plain.Wackett, Ellis Charles at World War 2 Nominal Roll. Retrieved on 4 August 2009. He then took a one-year post-graduate course in aeronautics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London, before returning to Australia to take up his service as a flying officer with the RAAF. Wackett's first role was to establish parachute instruction within the Air Force. His trip home from England had been postponed at the last minute to enable him to be trained; he began instructing volunteers in 1926 at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and made Australia's first freefall descent from a military aircraft‚Äîan Airco DH.9‚Äîon 26 May. The Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, himself made a successful jump on 5 August, to set \\"a good example\\" prior to making the wearing of parachutes compulsory for all aircrew. On 21 August, Wackett piloted the DH.9 from which Flying Officer Frederick Scherger made the first public display of parachuting in Australia, at Essendon, Victoria. The Supermarine Seagull III, serial A9‚Äì5, that Wackett flew on his Papuan Survey Flight in 1927 By August 1927, Wackett had been promoted flight lieutenant and given command of the Papuan Survey Flight formed at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria. Consisting of two Supermarine Seagull III single-engined amphibious biplanes and six aircrew, the flight was to examine and photograph the Papuan and New Guinean coasts as far north as Aitape and, if possible, Bougainville. Stripped of all equipment considered non-essential‚Äîincluding radio sets‚Äîto increase range, the aircraft departed on 27 September and journeyed some , covering almost of country and taking 350 photos. Wackett's machine (serial A9-5) returned to Melbourne on 26 December and the other (A9‚Äì6) on 19 January 1928.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 412‚Äì413 Inclement weather prevented the expedition from reaching Bougainville, and thick jungle cover limited the usefulness of its photographic record. Nevertheless, the Air Force learned valuable lessons concerning the Seagull's capabilities in a potential wartime role, as it was found to be unsuited to operations in the tropics.Wilson, The Eagle and the Albatross, pp. 26‚Äì27 On 14 August 1928, Wackett married Doreen Dove; they had two sons and a daughter.Legge, Who's Who in Australia 1977, p. 1058 In 1933, Wackett was posted to England to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. Returning to Australia, he was promoted to squadron leader and became Director of Technical Services, an organisation within the RAAF's Supply Branch, in May 1935; the appointment made Wackett the Air Force's senior engineer.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 70 The same year, he took charge of the Resources Committee for Electrical Equipment, Scientific and Optical Instruments, one of several subcommittees on the federal government's Defence Resources Board set up to investigate and report on the readiness of Australian industry to provide munitions for defence in the event of international conflict.Mellor, The Role of Science and Industry, p. 28 World War II George Jones, Director of Training (seated, second left), and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, Chief of the Air Staff (seated, far right), c. 1941 Ranked wing commander at the outbreak of World War II, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges in his role as Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British- built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 94 He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, motion sickness, decompression and hypoxia.Walker, Medical Services of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, p. 325 Wackett was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1941 New Year Honours. In June, he became the RAAF's representative on the federal Aircraft Advisory Committee, set up to assist the Director-General of Aircraft Production. As well as members from governmental and scientific bodies, the committee included delegates from aircraft manufacturers such as de Havilland Australia and CAC, with Lawrence Wackett acting as Chief Technical Advisor.Mellor, The Role of Science and Industry, p. 388 Later that year, the two brothers joined various academics on the newly formed Australian Council for Aeronautics, established by Prime Minister John Curtin to advise government, educational and scientific organisations on technical developments in the aircraft industry.Mellor, The Role of Science and Industry, p. 405 Raised to air commodore, Wackett was appointed Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AME) on 4 June 1942.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 450 As AME, he sat on the Air Board, the RAAF's controlling body, which consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 112 His new position had been created to replace that of the Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian post.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 479 Wackett would serve on the Air Board for the next seventeen years, a record tenure for the RAAF, his experience and intellect making him, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, \\"singularly adept at bringing a committee around to his point of view\\".Stephens, Going Solo, p. 81 During the war, the Air Board oversaw expansion from a complement in 1939 of 246 obsolescent machines such as CAC Wirraways, Avro Ansons and Lockheed Hudsons, to a strength in 1945 of 5,620 sophisticated aircraft including Supermarine Spitfires, P-51 Mustangs, de Havilland Mosquitoes and B-24 Liberators; to support this force, the RAAF had provided all-through training for 18,000 technical staff, and further education for 35,000 more schooled initially outside the service.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 152‚Äì154, 170‚Äì173 Post-war career Following the end of the war, Wackett contributed to \\"Plan D\\", the blueprint for restructuring the RAAF sponsored by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones. A major facet of Plan D, adopted in June 1947, was its encouragement of local industry to design and build military trainers and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This policy eventually led to the CAC Winjeel basic trainer and Australian co-partnership in production of the CAC Sabre jet fighter and GAF Canberra jet bomber.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 188Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 221‚Äì222 Wackett also supported Air Vice Marshal Joe Hewitt, the Air Member for Personnel, in fostering apprenticeships as part of what Stephens considered the \\"education revolution\\" that took place in the RAAF during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Apprentice Training Scheme, designed to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, opened early in 1948 at the Ground Training School in RAAF Station Wagga, New South Wales, to provide education and technical training for youths aged fifteen to seventeen. By 1952, it had been renamed the RAAF School of Technical Training.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 185‚Äì189 No. 91 (Composite) Wing RAAF, Iwakuni, Japan, April 1953 Wackett played a key role in establishing technical services as a distinct department within the RAAF, rather than forming part of the Supply Branch as in previous years. Mindful of the increasing responsibility that was being placed on scientific and technical resources in the modern Air Force, he had raised the question of a specialist engineering branch immediately after the war, and in March 1946 gained broad approval for its establishment. After eighteen months of work defining its scope and responsibilities, the Technical Branch was formed under Wackett's leadership on 23 September 1948, his goals being \\"to support the operational power of the RAAF by providing the most efficient technical organisation possible\\" and \\"to increase the effectiveness of air power through technical development\\". This in turn led to a separate \\"list\\" of engineering personnel, as opposed to the earlier Technical List subgroup under the General Duties Branch.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 171‚Äì173 For flexibility, and to ensure that the flying and engineering branches had a better appreciation of their respective operations, Wackett supported the practice of some general duties officers continuing to perform engineering work, and as many technical officers as possible receiving secondary training as aircrew. He was disappointed, however, by the limits imposed by the Air Board on career advancement for his personnel. While the General Duties Branch in the late 1940s was permitted to maintain thirty-seven officer positions of group captain and above, the Technical Branch was allowed only fourteen such slots, though both departments had an almost identical overall strength of just under 400 staff. This anomaly led Wackett to submit a dissenting report on the subject to the Air Board, one of the few occasions a board member exercised his right to such a protest. His new organisation caused some other tensions in the RAAF: new airworthiness considerations frustrated pilots who found their flying time restricted by the introduction of more rigorous maintenance procedures; supply officers feared being \\"outshone\\" by the new status accorded to engineers; and so-called \\"black handers\\"‚Äîold-school technical officers who had risen through the ranks‚Äîregarded with disdain the prospect of an influx of \\"silly young blokes with degrees\\". No. 77 Squadron RAAF, here inspecting a USAF F-86 Sabre at Kimpo in April 1953 Wackett had been promoted temporary air vice marshal on 1 January 1947; this rank was made substantive following the formation of the Technical Branch. On 31 October 1949, his title was changed from Air Member for Equipment and Maintenance to Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), in which capacity he would serve until his retirement from the RAAF in 1959. Appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1951 King's Birthday Honours, Wackett again worked closely with Air Vice Marshal Hewitt, now the Air Member for Supply and Equipment, to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on \\"life- of-type\\", whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed, to reduce costs and delivery time.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 182 In 1953, Wackett established advanced diploma training for twenty-five airmen annually at Melbourne Technical College, the graduates receiving commissions as pilot officers.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 137 He also began recruiting university- qualified engineers to the Technical Branch, and put in place formal relationships with such bodies as CSIRO, the Council of Aeronautics (of which he was a member), Aeronautical Research Laboratories, and local aircraft manufacturers de Havilland Australia, Government Aircraft Factories, and CAC. He further initiated RAAF sponsorship of a chair of aeronautics at the University of Sydney.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 440 Wackett was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1957 New Years Honours. Two years later, his wife Doreen was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her service as Vice President and, from 1948, President of the RAAF Women's Association. Later life and legacy When Wackett left the Air Force on 31 December 1959, he was its longest-serving officer. The next year he joined the Australian National Airlines Commission (ANAC), the controlling body of the federal government's domestic carrier, Trans Australia Airlines (TAA). He rose to the Vice Chairmanship of ANAC before retiring in 1968.Coulthard-Clark, Air Marshals of the RAAF, p. 34Gunn, Contested Skies, p. 246 During his term on the commission, Wackett witnessed the arrival of the Jet Age on domestic air routes; TAA took delivery of its first Boeing 727 in 1964, and its first Douglas DC-9 in 1967.Gunn, Contested Skies, pp. 199, 221 He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.Alexander, Who's Who in Australia 1962, p. 869 Like his brother Lawrence, who wrote two books on the subject, Ellis Wackett's chief hobby was angling. He died in Warracknabeal, Victoria, on 3 August 1984; his wife predeceased him in 1975. For his commitment to the concept of airworthiness, as an attitude to quality and professionalism that went beyond simply whether aircraft were fit to fly or not, Wackett was described in the official history of the post-war Air Force as among the \\"outstanding officers of the post-war era\\". The establishment of a dedicated Technical Branch, which he founded in 1948, was a key factor in the RAAF developing the ability to successfully manage the maintenance and upgrade of such highly sophisticated aircraft as the General Dynamics F-111.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 196, 290 Wackett's 17-year tenure on the Air Board, which was dissolved in 1976, remained the longest of any officer in the RAAF.Odgers, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 188 He was followed by a series of leaders of the Technical Branch (renamed Engineering Branch in 1966) who shared his vision, including Air Vice Marshals Ernie Hey (1960‚Äì1972) and James Rowland (1972‚Äì75).Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 178‚Äì179 Wackett was among those considered as possible successors to Air Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) when the latter was retired in 1952, but Prime Minister Robert Menzies' federal government chose an RAF officer for the role, Air Marshal Sir Donald Hardman.Rayner, The Commanders, p. 314 In any case, Air Force regulations at that time stipulated that appointees had to belong to the RAAF's General Duties (Aircrew) Branch. In 1975, Air Marshal Rowland was appointed as CAS, though he had to transfer from Engineering to General Duties before this could be formalised. The following year, the requirement for CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 296‚Äì297 Notes References        Category:1901 births Category:1984 deaths Category:Australian aviators Category:Australian aerospace engineers Category:Australian Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Australian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal Aeronautical Society Category:Graduates of the Royal Australian Naval College Category:People from Townsville Category:Royal Australian Air Force air marshals Category:Royal Australian Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Royal Australian Navy officers ","title":"Ellis Wackett"},{"id":"23977997","text":"Pholela High School, otherwise known as Pholela Institute or Pholela Public and at times called P.I. is a former self (and Dinaledi) proclaimed school of excellence. It used to be a boarding school run as an institution until it was made a public school in the year 2000. History Pholela High School is a school previously run by the Presbyterian Church. The school buildings were built in the old Dutch style, on the main road in Bulwer, directly facing the Amahwaqa Mountain. The school was well known before the 2000s as one of the few black schools that consistently produced good matric results. Unfortunately, due to mismanagement and other issues, the 2000s saw the fall of this once giant in the education scene. The issue started with the government taking over the school due to some issues in 1999, after this the situation would get worse every year leading eventually to the closure of the boarding facility in 2008. Efforts by the members of the church to renovate the school buildings did not yield any fruit and renovations were stopped with the view that it was not helping. Students were too negligent and vandalism of the new property was high. The faith of the founders had been justified and a coat of arms was adopted including the motto: \\"In hoc signo vinces\\" meaning \\"In this sign (the cross) you will conquer.\\" (Their motto has two crosses on either end). Academic, sporting cultural spiritual needs of school life were catered for. The school also has a large chapel at the centre as evidence of the church and religious influences Fund raising began for a chapel. Pholela High retained its Christian ethos for a long time of its history. There was a compulsory church service every Sunday and there were prayers held every night organised by the SCM (Student Christian Movement) and occasionally, this organisation organised late night Sunday services that gave the students much entertainment through different performances. Further classrooms were built including a Computer Room. On the sports front, provincial and, on occasion, national honours, have been earned in for example volleyball, soccer and netball. The school has a soccer/athletics field,a tennis court, volleyball court, a basketball field and 2 netball fields scattered over the large school premises.

About 685 students, mostly from the local areas of Bulwer, attend the school. Previously, the school attracted students from all over the country from as far afield as the Cape, Gauteng, etc. It is a Zulu-medium school and offers English as second languages (or first additional languages in the new FET curriculum). The school consists only of the black population from the local areas.

(, Jawi: ) are a native Malay ethnic group that lives in Brunei, the federal territory of Labuan, the southwestern coast of Sabah and the northern parts of Sarawak. The Bruneian Malays are a subgroup of the larger Ethnic Malays population found in the other parts of the Malay World, namely Peninsular Malaysia and the central and southern areas of Sarawak including neighbouring lands such as Singapore, Indonesia and Southern Thailand, having visible differences especially in language and culture, even though they are ethnically related to each other and follow the teachings of Islam. All Bruneian Malays who are born or domiciled in East Malaysia even for generations before or after the independence of the states of Sabah and Sarawak from the British Empire through the formation of Malaysia in 1963 are also considered Malaysian Malays in the national census and were in the same status like the Malaysian Malays domiciled in Peninsular Malaysian states and the central and southern parts of Sarawak. They are also defined as a part of the Bumiputera racial classification together as a subgroup within the Malaysian Malay ethnic population along with the Kadazan-Dusuns, Ibans, Malaccan Portuguese and the Malaysian Siamese. Etymology The northwest coast of Borneo, areas with large concentration of Bruneian Malays in Brunei and East Malaysia. As per an official statistics, the \\"Bruneian Malays\\" term only became official after the 1921 Brunei Ethnic Categories Census, which is different from the 1906 and 1911 census which only mentioned \\"Barunays\\" (Brunei's or Bruneian). It is possibly indicated a shift on the self- perception by the Bruneians about their Malay identity. The earliest recorded documentation by the West about Brunei is by an Italian known as Ludovico di Varthema, who also said the \\"Bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the peoples he met in Maluku Islands\\". On his documentation back to 1550; > We arrived at the island of Bornei (Brunei or Borneo), which is distant from > the Maluch about two hundred miles, and we found that it was somewhat larger > than the aforesaid and much lower. The people are pagans and are men of > goodwill. Their colour is whiter than that of the other sort....in this > island justice is well administered... Some historians have suggested that Bruneian Malay have been linked with the Chinese mainland due to its historical sources dependent on Chinese support. History Origin It is widely believed that the Brunei Kingdom was founded in 14th century by the first Sultan, Alak Batatar. However, from the Chinese records, an older Brunei was in existence as far back as 800 years before the founding of Brunei by Sultan Muhammad Shah, the first Sultan of Brunei. Even though some sources stated that the Malays of Brunei came from Yunnan and the Formosa Island (now Taiwan) through to the Philippines and settled on the coastal Borneo before expanding into Sumatra and Indochina countries like Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam as a result of their trading and seafaring way of life, researchers still unable to traced the origin of the old Brunei. Cultures Ambuyat, a quintessentially Bruneian Malay cuisine, it is considered as the national dish of the country. Cuisine As the official Brunei national dish, the Ambuyat is the main dish of the Bruneian Malays together with a number of types of snack such as lamban, punjung and many more. Music The main song and dance performed by this ethnic both in Brunei and Malaysia is the Adai-adai, which was traditionally sung by the Bruneian fishermens.

A street circuit is a motorsport racing circuit composed of temporarily closed-off public roads of a city, town or village, used in motor races. Facilities such as the paddock, pit boxes, fences and grandstands are usually placed temporarily and removed soon after the race is over but in modern times the pits, race control and main grandstands are sometimes permanently constructed in the area. Since the track surface is originally planned for normal speeds, race drivers often find street circuits bumpy and lacking grip. Run-off areas may be non-existent, which makes driving mistakes more expensive than in purpose-built circuits with wider run-off areas. Racing on a street circuit is also called \\"legal street racing\\". Local governments sometimes support races held in street circuits to promote tourism.

Written by Charles K. Pitts and Anne Wheeler the film is based on the life of a young women (Annie) who confesses to the murder of her husband. Annie is selected out of an orphanage to be a part of an arranged marriage and to be a house wife at a homestead. After countless rapes and times of abuse, George the brother of Simon (Annie's husband), murders Simon. As the story progresses, Annie confesses to this murder and her life and liberty are put into question. The movie has not received any specific awards, but Anne Wheeler was awarded the DGC Lifetime Award at the 2016 Directors Guild Canada Awards. Her awards stemmed from her achievements from films such as Better Than Chocolate, Edge of Madness, and Chi. Plot Annie Herron is abused by her husband, Simon, whilst his brother, George, was seemingly helpless to intervene. The film hits an interesting twist when Simon is murdered. Annie is convinced that she is the murderer, even as she gets herself admitted to the gaol in the Fort. In 1851, Annie is living in an orphanage and is put into an arranged marriage to Simon, who takes her to a homestead which is still being built. He puts her to work cooking and cleaning for him and his brother, George. At night, Simon expects Annie to submit to his rough sexual advances, even raping her several times. George tries to talk to Simon about treating Annie better, but his pleas fall on deaf ears. Simon becomes ever more brutal towards Annie, even beating her while he's in a drunken rage. Meanwhile, George himself is interested in pursuing Annie, which puts her into emotional turmoil. Simon's murder culminates these events, with Annie being locked up in the gaol, while a Detective, Henry Mullen, investigates. Through flashbacks, we learn that George, distraught from witnessing how his brother treated Annie, kills Simon by hitting him in the back with an axe. He brings Simon's body back to the homestead, telling Annie that a tree branch had fallen on him. Annie, by this time, had been driven mad from the beatings and rapes Simon had forced upon her. She hits Simon posthumously on the head with a rock. She and George consummate their feelings. Days later, she admits herself to the gaol, while George has fled the homestead to stay with a neighboring family. Annie finds out while in the gaol that she is pregnant, but is not certain whether the father is Simon or George. She declares the baby girl as being Simon's child, so that the child will always be welcome and cared for in later life. George marries the neighboring family's daughter, Jenny.

Anne Wheeler described her displeasure for the small release, but attributed it partly to having no major stars in the film  Response  The film \\"Edge of Madness\\" has a limited amount of critical reviews and responses, but enough to form an opinion as well as an overall consensus. The movie received a 45% on Rotten Tomatoes, and a 6.3/10 of IMDb. Through IMDb there is handful of viewer responses, many of which state it is a relatively good film for low budget. Many of the critical responses have also claimed the same thing as viewers saying it was intriguing for a small-budget film, but some parts were rather dull References External links  Category:Canadian films Category:2002 films Category:English-language films Category:Films about rape Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films about domestic violence Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films based on works by Alice Munro ","title":"Edge of Madness"},{"id":"23978415","text":"Linaria bipartita is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family known by the common name clovenlip toadflax.

Background Gray studied painting and design at Goldsmiths College School of Art, London University, where he was a fellow student and friend of the artist-designer Graham Sutherland. During the First World War he served in the Royal Engineers where, like other celebrated artists and designers in both World Wars, he was involved in camouflage work. In 1930 he became a founder member of the Society of Industrial Artists (SIA, see Chartered Society of Designers), which sought to gain professional recognition for the designer in industry. By this time multidisciplinary design consultancies had begun to emerge in the United States. Almost by way of response Gray established the Bassett-Gray Group of Artists and Writers in 1934 which became the Industrial Design Partnership (1935‚Äì40), dealing mainly with graphics and product design. One of the cofounders of the latter, Misha Black, joined with Gray and Herbert Read to establish the Design Research Unit (DRU) in 1943, a consultancy which sought to provide design expertise for post-war industry, commerce, and the state. It became widely recognized for corporate identity design for many leading companies and organizations, such as Courage Breweries, ICI, and the British Aluminium Company. During the Second World War Gray was employed on the recommendation of Frank Pick at the Ministry of Information, initially as head of its newly formed exhibitions division then as an adviser on exhibition design, a field of expertise which he subsequently applied successfully in the Design at Home exhibition of 1945, the Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946, and the Festival of Britain of 1951. Roles and recognitions Gray was also involved in design education, with numerous teaching appointments at leading art schools, including the Royal College of Art and the Sir John Cass school, where he was principal from 1937 to 1940. He also advised the BBC on its series Looking at Things, which was broadcast between 1949 and 1955. He was active as a lecturer and writer on many aspects of design, including Package Design (1955) and Lettering for Architects and Designers (1962). Through the DRU he also played a significant role as a consultant to industry. One of his most ambitious projects was the framing, in 1964, of the British Railways corporate identity programme, the working party for which he had chaired. He also received official recognition: in 1938 he was elected Royal Designer for Industry, was appointed Master of the Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry in 1955, and was awarded the SIA's first Gold Medal for outstanding design achievement. He was awarded CBE in the 1963 Birthday Honours.

Route description At its western end, Shippen Street begins at Palisade Avenue, where over the city line in Union City it is now known as 24th Street, and creates the northern border for Elsworth Park, a city square from the 19th century. The two-way street gradually descends as it is intersected first by northbound Hudson Avenue and then southbound Gregory Avenue. At its eastern end, the street provides a view of the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix and, directly across the North River, of the Empire State Building and New York Skyline. Shippen Street then becomes an eastbound one- way street that ends at Hackensack Plank Road. In its entirety, the street is about 1690 feet. History Hoboken Land and Improvement Company holdings. Weehawken Heights was the site of Mountain Pavilion (center) Shippen Street was named after William W. Shippen, who owned large properties in Weehawken Heights next to those in West Hoboken belonging to the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, of which he was the president for 21 years.Obituary: William W.

September 3, 1885 A prominent German immigrant population in the area during the late 19th century included large groups of anarchists; several saloons could be found in the Union Hill area. The largest assembly hall, The New Casino, was on Shippen Street.Tom Goyens Beer and revolution: the German anarchist movement in New York City, 1880-1914, University of Illinois Press, 2007 Although it now ends at Palisades, in the past the name Shippen Street was used at least as far as Central Avenue,Annual report of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of the State New Jersey. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, Issue 7, p. 75, 2008 where it was once proposed by the city government and townspeople to repurpose a 200-foot shaft used to build the railroad tunnels as a station stop that would provide North Hudson's then-130,000 residents within a 1-mile radius of the shaft with transportation to the Pennsylvania Station being constructed in Manhattan. In 1904, the Geological Society surveyed the area,Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, Volume 16: Projected Hudson River tunnels of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 1905 but ultimately no stop was made on Shippen Street. A few years later in 1907, 125 men working in the North River Tunnels were forced to evacuate through the Shippen Street opening when tar paper used for waterproofing caught fire. Eleven men were unaccounted for upon the initial count; they were found 500 feet from the shaft at Shippen alive but unconscious, and had apparently survived by inhaling oxygen through a compressed air pipe which they hacked through. Although some were hospitalized with serious injury, none were reported dead.\\"11 Overcome in Tube\\". The New York Times.

It was placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on December 8, 1997 under its list of historic preservation sites.DEP - Historic Preservation Office: New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places NJ Register of Historic Places Entering the turns first require a 90¬∞ turn where the road remains paved with concrete. The road becomes cobblestone after the second turn, a 180¬∞ turn. The third turn, also a 180¬∞ turn, is housed completely by the original stone wall. Finally, the last turn is out onto Hackensack Plank Road which if going southbound, requires another 180¬∞ turn and ends the cobblestone portion of the street. The one-way hairpin road is about 440 ft. when traveled along the centerline path. At the north side is a staircase connecting the upper and lower ends of the hairpins, which allows pedestrians to avoid the walk where there are no sidewalks. Both sets of stairs accommodated many workers commuting to the factories on Gregory Avenue. The buildings overlooking the Horseshoe, as it has always been known by the locals, was the factory of S. Blickman & Co. which operated a stainless steel fabricating plant at the site for about 70 years. The plant produced stainless steel for many industrial and commercial purposes and was oriented to outfitting the many ships built along the Hoboken waterfront in Todd Shipyards (the family of former Governor Christy Todd Whitman) and Bethlehem Steel Shipyards. It produced most of the stainless steel equipment used to outfit Naval vessels constructed on the East coast during the Second World War. Blickman outgrew the factory and eventually the disused building was converted to condominiums in the 1980s. Further down the street on the corner of Gregory and Hackensack Plank Road was the factory of Robert Reiner & Co. which imported and customized Swiss embroidery machines when Hudson County was the center of the embroidery industry in the US in the first half of the 20th Century. During the time of their operation Shippen Street was the only local street capable of accommodating the turn of many large tractor trailer trucks which serviced these two large and active factories. Delivering truck size rolls of stainless steel and carrying away the often huge finished products fit for outfitting large ships. No parking was permitted on Gregory Avenue until the factories both ceased operation. Shippen Steps left At the end of Shippen Street, directly across from the double hairpin curve are the Shippen Steps, an outdoor public staircase down the Palisades Cliffs which continues in the same direction as Shippen Street. They begin on Hackensack Plank road and end at Park Avenue. There are 96 steps, with a diagonal span in length of about 250 feet. In the past, the steps provided townspeople with access to Weehawken's original town hall, as well as the old police station, which is at 309 Park Avenue. It was built in 1890, and the first floor features a jail cell where police operations occurred. The building was last used as the VFW post 1923 meeting place.\\"Shippen Street and Park Avenue\\".

Nathan Rabin of The A. V.

It is, instead, a laughless, irritatingly earnest comedy-drama about ...\\" the characters played by Mihok and Facinelli. Rabin said Hewitt and Lillard have little more than cameos but credits Lillard for giving the film what little spark it has.

This applies to all forms of sexual activity. In May 2008, the Canadian government passed a bill to raise the age of consent from 14 to 16, while creating a close-in-age exemption for sex between 14‚Äì15 year olds and partners less than 5 years older, and keeping an existing close- in-age clause for sex between 12‚Äì13 year olds and partners less than 2 years older.http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html The initiative also maintains a temporary exception for already existing marriages of 14 and 15 year olds, but forbids new marriages like these in the future. In June 2019, C-75 passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received royal assent; it repealed Section 159 effective immediately and made the age of consent equal at 16 for all individuals. Previous 1890 law In 1890, the age of consent was raised from 12 to 14. Battle against Internet predators Former Toronto police officer Paul Gillespie said the bill would give police \\"more tools\\" in the battle against Internet predators. The intention of the bill is to target \\"sexual predators\\" and pimps. Other groups that supported the increase in the age of consent were the National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC), the Canada Family Action Coalition (CFAC), Canadian Crime Victim Foundation (CCVF), Beyond Borders Inc. and Canadians Addressing Sexual Exploitation (CASE). Case of Dale Eric Beckham One of the motivators for the reform of these laws in Canada was the case of Dale Eric Beckham. In March 2005, Beckham, then 31 years old, travelled from his home in Woodlands, Texas to Ottawa, Ontario to meet with a 14-year-old boy he had met over the internet. The boy's parents, after observing him sneaking away in the middle of the night into a taxi, alerted the police who tracked the cab to a downtown hotel. Police found Beckham and the boy unclothed in a hotel room, where they were engaged in sexual activity; it was later determined that the two had also engaged in sexual intercourse the previous night. Police also discovered hundreds of pornographic images of children on a laptop computer that Beckham had brought with him from Texas. Beckham was arrested and held without bail. In Beckham's home state of Texas, the age of consent is 17 and violators can face prison terms of up to 10‚Äì20 years. In Canada, sexual activity with children as young as 16 is legal (was 14 until and prior to May 2008) as long as it was consensual and the adult is not in a position of authority or dependency. The boy, who reportedly suffered from social anxiety disorder and had shown signs of being suicidal, insisted during interviews with the police that the sex with Beckham was consensual. Consequently, the only crime Beckham could be prosecuted for in Canada was a relatively minor offense of possession of child pornography. In November 2005, Beckham pleaded guilty and was sentenced to the time already served. He was then ordered deported back to the United States.Woodlands man admits he seduced teen online , KHOU.com, July 10, 2006Man gets 17 years in child porn case by Jamie Nash, Houston Community Newspapers, November 14, 2007.Woodlands man accused of luring boy online By Renee C. Lee, Houston Chronicle, March 9, 2005.Woodlands man sent to prison in child sex case by Cindy George, Houston Chronicle, November 7, 2007. After being notified of his arrest in Canada, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents searched Beckham's home in Woodlands, Texas where they discovered a massive quantity of child pornography on his computer, with some depicting children less than 12 years old engaged in sexual acts with adults. After returning to the United States, Beckham was immediately arrested and held without bond. In July 2007, Beckham pleaded guilty to a federal charge of transporting child pornography to Canada,United States Code: Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 110, ¬ß 2252A(a)(1), available online at Cornell University Law School.Under the plea agreement, the prosecution agreed to dismiss a second charge of possession of child pornography involving the sexual exploitation of minors. The prosecution also agreed not to prosecute Beckham for charges relating to the online enticement of a minor and travel in interstate and foreign commerce for illicit sex. (see: United States of America v. Dale Eric Beckham, Page 5.) although his lawyer argued (unsuccessfully) that Beckham's behaviour was the result of diminished capacity. In November 2007, Beckham was sentenced to 17 years in prison, to be followed by lifetime supervision.The Woodlands Man Sentenced to Prison for Child Pornography , United States Attorney's Office (USAO) ‚Äì Southern District of Texas, November 7, 2007.United States of America v.

This case raised concerns that child molesters, not just in Canada but also from abroad, were taking advantage of Canada's low age of consent to sexually exploit vulnerable children while escaping criminal prosecution.Web luring case raises age-of-consent issue, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), March 11, 2005 Criticisms LGBT rights activists These activists also criticized the bill, because it does not address the issue of equality, maintaining the present Canadian age of consent for anal sex outside of marriage at 18. Hillary Cook, spokeswoman for gay rights group Egale Canada believes the bill is \\"an attempt to score partisan points\\". In June 2019, C-75 passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received royal assent repealed section 159 - effective immediately and made the age of consent equal at 16 for all individuals. Attorney General suit In March 2009 a lawsuit was brought against the Attorney General of Canada alleging the Age of Sexual Consent increase was a direct violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms within the Constitution of Canada. Standing on behalf of public interest was denied and the matter remains unresolved through the Canadian Courts. Organizations Canadian AIDS Society The Canadian AIDS Society has stated that \\"increasing the age of consent could result in young people being more secretive about their sexual practices and not seeking out the information they need. This will place youth at an increased risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\\" Canadian Children's Rights Council They referenced an article in The Globe and Mail which highlighted the opinions of Martha Mackinnon (Justice for Children and Youth, executive director) who had expressed concern this would decrease the pursuit of condoms. Canadian Federation for Sexual Health This proposal has received criticism from different organizations and individuals. Andrea Cohen of the pro-choice Canadian Federation for Sexual Health (formerly International Planned Parenthood Federation) said the organization believes the legislation does nothing to keep youth from harm. She talked on CTV News Channel's \\"Mike Duffy Live\\" where she stated: \\"What it will do is infringe upon the rights of youth in terms of their ability to make decisions on their own sexuality\\". Later (in 2007) her organization issued an official position statement. Child Welfare League of Canada Peter Dudding, Executive Director of the Child Welfare League of Canada, criticized the bill's effect of removing judicial discretion in cases involving 14- and 15-year-olds: \\"When we deal with arbitrary cut-offs, we lose the flexibility to apply the law in a much more specific and individualized kind of way.\\" References See also * Age of consent * Age of consent reform Category:Canadian law Reform in Canada Category:Adolescent sexuality in Canada ","title":"Age of consent reform in Canada"},{"id":"23978713","text":"Hans √òrsted may refer to: * Hans Christian √òrsted (1777‚Äì1851), Danish chemist and physicist * Hans-Henrik √òrsted (born 1954), Danish track cyclist See also * √òrsted (disambiguation) ","title":"Hans √òrsted"},{"id":"23978761","text":"Siege Julien Hequembourg Bryan (23 May 1899 in Titusville, Pennsylvania ‚Äì 20 October 1974) was an American photographer, filmmaker, and documentarian.

At seventeen after graduating from high school, he volunteered to serve American Field Service for the French Army in World War I, driving an ambulance in Verdun and the Argonne, and wrote a book Ambulance 464 about this experience illustrated by his photographs He graduated from Princeton University in 1921 and finished Union Theological Seminary, though he chose not to be ordained as a minister. Afterwards he directed YMCA in Brooklyn, NY At this time Bryan started traveling abroad taking photographs, making films and writing travelogues along the way. He funded his travels by giving slideshow lectures about countries he visited and by selling his films to various companies including ERPI. Many of the films from those travels can be found in United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive. Those human-interest movies chronicle travels through China, Caucasus and Georgia (1933), Soviet Union (1930 and 1935), Poland (1936), Germany (1937), Switzerland and the Netherlands (1939). His films and photographs from Nazi Germany chronicled party rallies, daily life on the streets, anti-Jewish propaganda and Nazi leaders. They were incorporated into two ‚Äô‚ÄôMarch of Time‚Äô‚Äô films. His slide lectures were held in concert halls including Carnegie Hall. World War II Bryan found Polish girl Kazimiera (12) and her dead sister Anna (14), just shot by a German plane in September 1939 He continued to photograph the girl as she tried to understand what had just happened Bryan comforted and cried with the girl after photographing her. They met again 20 years later Bryan learned about the German invasion of Poland on September 3 while traveling by train to Warsaw. He arrived in Warsaw on September 7 carrying his Leica still camera, Bell & Howell movie camera and 6000 feet of film, just as all foreigners, diplomats and government official were fleeing the capital. He contacted mayor of Warsaw Stefan Starzynski who provided him with a car, guide and interpreter Stefan Radlinski and permit to travel and photograph across Warsaw. In two weeks between September 7 and September 21, he managed to take hundreds of still photographs including color Kodachromes and 5000 feet of motion picture film documenting the Siege of Warsaw and the terror bombing of the city by German Luftwaffe. He recalled: In 2009, the grown-up girl, Kazimiera Mika, spoke about the event and said she was 12 at the time.http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,54420,6986800,Bohaterowie_zdjec_sprzed_70_lat.html They had first reunited in 1958, when Bryan returned to Warsaw.https://www.thenation.com/article/witness-total-war/ Bryan is credited as the only foreign journalist in Warsaw at that time. Through Polish Radio he also made an appeal to the American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help civilians targeted by enemy bombers. During his stay in Warsaw he lived in the abandoned Consulate of the United States. He left Warsaw on September 21 after Germans declared a cease-fire to allow citizens of neutral countries to depart by train through East Prussia. In K√∂nigsberg fearing confiscation of his material he decided to smuggle out his already developed films. He managed to hide some of his films in souvenir gas mask containers collected by fellow traveler from US, by one account he hid some movies by wrapping them around his torso. After arriving in New York in the fall of 1939 Bryan published some of his photographs. Life magazine printed 15 of his images in the October 23 issue and Look Magazine published another 26 in the December 5 issue. Bryan produced in 1940 as a short documentary film Siege, released by RKO Radio Pictures. and wrote a book with the same title. The film was nominated for an Academy Award the following year for Best Short Subject, One-reel. Although film Siege is only 10 minutes long, Julien Bryan presented Franklin Delano Roosevelt his 80 minutes long film from fighting Warsaw.http://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,95190,8695244,Robil_zdjecia_w_stolicy__Mialy_pokazac_okrucienstwo.html In 1940 Bryan was hired by the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) to make a series of 23 educational movies on Latin American culture and customs. Afterwards State Department hired him to create another five movies about US.

As part of an official UNRRA delegation he revisited Gda≈Ñsk and Warsaw. His Kodachrome footage of recently destroyed Gda≈Ñsk is probably the first post-war film shot in that city. In 1958 Bryan revisited Poland and published one hundred of his 1939 photographs from Warsaw. Working with daily newspaper Express Wieczorny they launched a big campaign, with a page of the 1939 pictures in each issue, and the words: \\"Do you recognize yourself, your relatives, your house and street? The Express is helping American photographer Julien Bryan to find the heroes of his film from besieged Warsaw in 1939.\\" Readers who recognized anything in his pictures were asked to come to the newspaper's offices with that information. That way he met and recorded stories of many people in his photographs. He wrote about his experiences in Warsaw: 1939 siege, 1959 Warsaw Revisited published in 1959 in Poland. Siege by Julien Bryan In 1945, Bryan started the International Film Foundation (IFF) and for the remainder of his career he made short documentary films for the school market. Son Sam Bryan joined IFF in 1960. Bryan died in 1974, just two months after receiving a medal from the Polish government for his still photography. After his death IFF was operated by Sam.

In Banaras he worked for Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha Political career The Indian people were trying to free India from the British rule. He was impressed by the freedom movement of India and involved in that movement. At the same time he remembered the miserable condition of the general public of Nepal. The public were suffering from poverty, illiteracy and ignorance. They were being exploited by the ruling class who had no law to obey and who lived in luxury. Tyranny, debauchery, economic exploitation and religious persecution characterized Rana rule. This 104-years of Rana regime has been called as one of the darkest periods of Nepalese history. Dasharath Chand could not resist protesting the rulers. He was determined to end the Rana rule. He began to write articles against the Ranas in the Janata published from Patna in India, under the pseudonym of Sewasingh. Dasharath Chand met Tanka Prasad Acharya and Dharma Bhakta Mathema who were active in starting a political revolution in Nepal. A Political party called the Nepal Praja Parishad was organized in the presidency of Tanka Prasad Acharya in Nepal with the active participation of Dasharath Chand. It became active and started distributing pamphlets explaining the arbitrary Rana rule. For about 4 months, the government did not know who were doing it. At last, a reward of Rs. 5000 was announced for the revelation of the secret. The reward tempted Ramji Joshi, a member of Praja Parishad and he disclosed the secret.

At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a moderately large bore (up to five feet (1.5m) high). It is said to take its name from √Ügir, the Norse god of the ocean,Richard Stone, The River Trent, (2005), p9, p124, Phillimore & Co Ltd, although this is disputed. A more likely derivation is from Old English ƒìagor (‚Äúflood, stream, water‚Äù).Indirectly attested in the poetic kennings ƒìgorhere, \\"water-host,\\" deluge, and ƒìgorstrƒìam, \\"flood-stream.\\"https://www.thefreedictionary.com/eagre The Aegir occurs when a high spring tide meets the downstream flow of the river. The funnel shape of the river mouth exaggerates this effect, causing a large wave to travel upstream as far as Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, and sometimes beyond. The Aegir cannot travel much beyond Gainsborough as the shape of the river reduces the Aegir to little more than a ripple, and weirs north of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire stop its path completely. The Aegir can be seen at Gainsborough, Morton, East Stockwith, West Stockwith and Owston Ferry. The Environment Agency used to publish predictions for the occurrence of the bore, but now no longer provide these. Predictions for the Aegir in 2019 can be found on the Crowle.org website.https://crowle.org/?p=4724 The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO) provides a lot of useful tidal prediction information. The UKHO have a free tidal prediction service which provides tidal times for the forthcoming week.http://www.ukho.gov.uk/easytide/EasyTide/index.aspx It is alleged that King Cnut performed his purposely unsuccessful attempt to turn the tide back in the River Trent at Gainsborough.

The Petrodvorets Watch Factory is Russia's oldest factory, founded by Peter the Great in 1721. Raketa watches have been produced for the Red Army, the Soviet Navy, and for North Pole expeditions, as well as for civilians. Today, Raketa is one of a handful of global watch brands that produces its own movements from start to finish. Origin  On 13 April 1961, Yuri Gagarin made the first manned flight in outer space on the rocket, Vostok 1. In honour of this achievement, the Petrodvorets Watch Factory named its watches \\"Rocket\\"; Raketa in Russian. However, at the height of the Cold War the name \\"Raketa\\" was perceived negatively in the West, as the word was associated with the latest generation of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles, the R-16. During Soviet times it became one of the most produced watch brands in the world. In the 1970s, the factory produced about five million mechanical watches per year.coolbrandspeople.com Meeting Jacques Graf von Polier in Moskow reuters.com Astrid Wendlandt, Watchmaker to the Tsars on European comeback trail. 4 November 2011. In 2014, a high-end Raketa collection based on the new in-house Raketa-Avtomat movement was released including the following models: *\\"Petrodvorets Classic Avtomat\\"; *\\"Amphibia\\"; *\\"Polar\\"; *\\"Zvezda\\"; *\\"Pilot\\"; *\\"Balerina\\" With prices similar to Swiss luxury brands, the quality, fit and finish of Raketa timepieces have improved markedly since the 1960s. Since \\"Raketa\\" is one of the rare manufacturers capable of fully producing its watches, including movements, hairsprings and escapements in-house, its parent firm, Petrodvorets Watch Factory, is beginning to supply some Swiss watch brands having difficulty acquiring Swiss ETA movements. Raketa Mechanical Movements Over the years, the Petrodvorets Watch Factory has produced more than two dozen versions of Raketa movements. Some have been equipped with features such as automatic winding, calendars, 24-hour models for polar explorers, anti-magnetic watches (for use in case of a nuclear attack), as well as watches for the military. Mechanical Raketa watches were exported to many Eastern Bloc and communist countries and are considered one of the most durable and reliable movements in the world. By the 1980s, Raketa was producing five million watches a year. The Petrodvorets Watchmaking School Being one of the few watch brands in the world producing its own movements, the factory has created its own watchmaking school, the Petrodvorets Watchmaking School, to ensure the transmission of watchmaking expertise to future generations. The only one left in the schooling program has been established in collaboration with the Saint Petersburg Technical institute. Hairsprings and Escapements The Petrodvorets Watch Factory Raketa is one of only five watch brands in the world producing their movements in-house from start to finish, including hairsprings and escapements. Most watch brands globally do not produce their own hairsprings, they generally order them from Nivarox, a subsidiary of Swatch Group. This enables the Russian military industry to be independent of western suppliers, especially for producing hairsprings needed in the military aviation industry. Raketa Monumental Clock Built in 2014 on Moscow's Lubyanka Square in the main atrium of the Central Children's Store on Lubyanka, the Raketa Monumental Clock is the world's largest clock movement. It weighs 5 tons and measures 13 metres high by 8 metres wide. Built and assembled in a record six months, it has rapidly become a major tourist attraction in Moscow. The Mayor of Moscow, Sergey Sobyanin inaugurated the clock in January 2015. The Petrodvorets Watch Factory Raketa is only one of the brands produced by the Petrodvorets Watch Factory, albeit probably its most famous brand. Other Petrodvorets brands include Pobeda and Talberg among others. Before the Russian Revolution (1917), the factory also produced objects made of precious and semi-precious stones for the Tsar and his family. Later, it began to produce goods for military manufacturers as well as \\"jewels\\" for the watch industry. In 1949, the factory released the first wristwatches under the names Zvezda (\\"–ó–≤–µ–∑–¥–∞\\", star) and Pobeda (\\"–ü–æ–±–µ–¥–∞\\", victory). The factory's own watches, sold under the brand name Raketa, first appeared in 1961.

Ambassadors and Swiss specialists In 2009, the Petrodvorets Watch Factory employed three highly ranked Swiss watchmakers to help the factory adapt its production to modern standards. These watchmakers had previously worked for Rolex, Breguet and Hautlence. In 2011, the Petrodvorets Watch Factory announced that the super-model Natalia Vodianova offered to design a new watch model. Vodianova's model is based on a vintage Raketa design from 1974. A portion of the sales of this \\"Raketa by Vodianova\\" will be contributed to Vodianova's Naked Heart Foundation. In 2012, Jean-Claude Quenet, former director of Rolex's escapement department and of production at Franck Muller, joined the Russian factory. Also, in 2013 Prince Rostislav Rostislavovich Romanov became advisor to the creative department of the factory and a member of its board of directors. He created a special new design of watches commemorating the 400-year jubilee of the Romanov Dynasty. in 2014, a Swiss mechanical engineer, Florian Schlumpf, was appointed head of engineering and construction of monumental clocks.

She was hit in her \\"Q\\" turret by a salvo from SMS Derfflinger, which blew the roof off the turret over the side. It was either this shell hit which caused a flash down the magazine or a second shell in the same salvo that penetrated the armour and exploded in the magazine, causing a massive explosion.

Life Adam Newton's Charlton House He spent part of his early life in France, passing himself off as a priest and teaching at the college of St. Maixant in Poitou. There, for some time between 1580 and 1590, he instructed the future theologian Andr√© Rivet in Greek. After his return to Scotland he was, about 1600, appointed tutor to Prince Henry, and filled that post until 1610, when, upon the formation of a separate household for his pupil, now created Prince of Wales, he was appointed his secretary. He was naturalized as an English citizen in James's first English parliament. In 1605 he obtained the deanery of Durham through royal influence, although he was not in orders, and was installed by proxy. The duties of the office must also have been done by proxy, if at all. In 1606 he acquired the manor of Charlton, Kent, where he built Charlton House. Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury wrote humourous letters to Newton. Apologising for a breach of manners, he compared himself to the court jester Tom Durie.Henry Ellis, Original Letters Illustrative of English History, 3rd Series, vol. 4 (London, 1846), p. 163. In another letter to Newton he wrote that if a certain man failed to gain a place in Prince Henry's household, he should be sent to \\"Tom Dyrry or to me\\". The applicant was poor but could become rich by charging a fee to all the girls in England who wished to meet the Prince.Thomas Birch, Life of Henry Prince of Wales (London, 1760), p. 138 After the death of Prince Henry, in 1612, Newton became receiver-general, or treasurer in the household of Prince Charles, relinquishing to Thomas Murray his claim to the secretaryship. He retained his post until his death. In 1620 he was made a baronet, first selling the deanery of Durham to Dr. Richard Hunt, and presumably paying for his new honour with the proceeds. After Charles's accession Newton became secretary to the council, and in 1628 secretary to the marches of Wales, the reversion of which office had been granted to him as early as 1611; it was worth ¬£2,000 year. He died 13 January 1630. His executors David Cunningham of Auchenharvie and Peter Newton were instructed to use a legacy to rebuild the nearby St Luke's Church, Charlton.John Burke, A genealogical and heraldic history of the extinct and dormant baronetcies of England (London, 1838), p. 385: Henry Vane, 'Historical Memoir on Charlton', Gentleman's Magazine (May 1865), pp. 576, 580. Works Newton translated into Latin King James's Discourse against Vorstius and books i-vi. of Paolo Sarpi's History of the Council of Trent, which had been published in 1620 in London in an English version made from the Italian original by Sir Nathaniel Brent. Newton's translation was published anonymously in London in 1620. Thomas Smith complimented the work and man in his Vita quorumdam Eruditissimorum Virorum. Family In 1605 Newton married Katherine, youngest daughter of Sir John Puckering, lord-keeper of the great seal in the reign of Elizabeth, whose son Thomas Puckering shared the prince's studies under Newton's guidance. She died in 1618. Their son Henry adopted his mother's surname, and became Sir Henry Puckering, 3rd Baronet, after inheriting his uncle Thomas Puckering's estates and titles in 1654.

It is the highest of a group of domed hills which lie in remote land between the head of Glen Tilt and Glen Shee to the east.Glas Tulaichean at Visit Scotland It is most commonly climbed from the Spittal of Glenshee via Glen Lochsie to the south.  Geography  At Glas Tulaichean is a Munro and is ranked as the 79th highest mountain in Scotland. The mountain is bounded by Gleann M√≤r to the North, Glen Lochsie to the South and Gleann Taitneach to the East. On the east and south side a series of ridges radiate out from the summit, whilst the north western side drops steeply down into Gleann M√≤r. On the east side three pronounced ridges enclose two corries, Glas Choire Bheag and Glas Choire Mhor, which drop into Gleann Taitneach. The southern slopes are less steep with grassy ridges descending into Glen Lochsie.  Ascent  The most common route of ascent is from the south where a landrover track ascends gentle slopes from Glen Lochsie almost to the summit cairn. A dismantled railway line runs from the Dalmunzie Hotel close to the Spittal of Glenshee and this forms a good path through Glen Lochsie to the ruin of the Glenlochsie Lodge. From here the landrover track continues up Breac-reidh, the southern ridge of Glas Tulaichean, to reach the summit cairn. The remoteness of the area means that the neighbouring Munros of C√†rn an R√¨gh and Beinn Iutharn Mh√≤r are often combined with Glas Tulaichean. Natural heritage Glas Tulaichean is a site of special scientific interest - protected for its outstanding representation of upland flowering plants. Scottish Natural Heritage's site management statement for the site reads - \\"The geology consists of acid rocks with limestone outcropping in the northernmost extremity of Glas Choire Bheag, and underlying the southern side of Gleann Mor. With the exception of the ridges, the SSSI boundary follows the 800m contour in Gleann Mor, the 760m contour in Glas Choire Bheag and Glas Choire Mhor, and the 840m contour on the south and west sides of the site. The high altitude areas support habitats and species which are particularly well adapted to this hostile environment. The site is notified as an SSSI because of the number of rare arctic-alpine vascular plant species. The outcrops of limestone in Glas Choire Bheag are rich in plants. Until the population was recently increased by planting, there was only a single female bush of the woolly willow, one of only 11 known sites in the UK - the nearest population elsewhere is within Caenlochan Glen. There are a number of other rare plants, including the rare downy willow, as well as mosses and liverworts. These are mostly associated with rock outcrops and limestone soils but springs and flushes where lime-rich and snowbed vegetation occurs also hold more notable species. Although not part of the notified features, there are extensive montane heaths which support breeding dotterel. The SSSI lies within the Cairngorms Massif Special Protection Area (SPA) which is designated for its breeding population of golden eagles.\\" References * The Munros, Donald Bennet (Editor) Category:Munros Category:Mountains and hills of the Eastern Highlands Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of Perth and Kinross Category:One-thousanders of the British Isles ","title":"Glas Tulaichean"},{"id":"23978965","text":"John Reeve Lavell (December 11, 1857 - January 10, 1925) was a lawyer and political figure in Ontario, Canada.

By the time of the 1891 Census, his father had died, and the family were living in Preston, Lancashire, where his mother was landlady of the Cross Keys pub. Aspden was on the books of Preston North End by November 1899. He played for their Lancashire Combination team, but did not always impress, but none for the first team, and joined Southern League club Kettering in June 1902. He played for Kettering for a season and then, amid interest from other Southern League clubs, returned to Lancashire to sign for Football League Second Division club Burnley in August 1903. He made his Burnley debut in the opening game of the 1903‚Äì04 season, a goalless draw with Chesterfield on 5 September 1903, appeared in each of the first eight matches of the season, and scored his first goal for the club on 3 October in a 2‚Äì0 win over Grimsby Town. He then spent the next four matches out of the Burnley side, his place in the starting line-up taken by Jimmy Hogan. He returned to the team for the 3‚Äì1 loss to Lincoln City on 19 December and from then on missed only one game in the remainder of the season. On 23 January 1904, Aspden scored both goals in the 2‚Äì1 win against Preston North End at Turf Moor. He ended the season with four goals in 29 league appearances but left Burnley in the summer of 1904 to join Brighton & Hove Albion of the Southern League. Aspden played seven Southern League matches for Brighton before damaging a knee during a match in October. After specialist surgery to repair a displaced cartilage, he was able to resume playing reserve-team football by the following March. He returned north, and in October 1905 joined Oldham Athletic of the Lancashire Combination, with whom he ended his career. The 1911 Census finds Aspden, his wife, Emily n√©e Cookson, their two young children and a boarder living in Accrington, where Aspden worked as a billiard manager. He was resident in Lytham St Annes at the time of his death in Rossall Hospital, Fleetwood, in 1959 at the age of 78.

He is today best known for his work on Nathaniel Hawthorne, especially Hawthorne's Selected Tales and Sketches (1950), Hawthorne: A Critical Study (1956) and The Presence of Hawthorne (1979), and in 1978 played a pivotal role in the authentication of the novelist's \\"lost notebook\\".Mitchell 1993. In the year of Waggoner's death, he was honoured with the House of Seven Gables Hawthorne Award. He did not, however, confine his output to one author: \\"I've moved around the field\\", he declared, \\"at the risk of being superficial.\\"Quoted in Mitchell 1993. Among the other literary figures who incurred his attention were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Robert Frost, Walt Whitman and William Faulkner. Biography Waggoner was born in Pleasant Valley, New York, on November 19, 1913. In his youth he attended a single-room school in upstate New York, and later Middlebury College, where out of the science-religion conflict he found fully his Christian faith, writing to his Presbyterian pastor that he could not go on as merely a \\"nominal Christian\\". The year after his 1935 graduation from Middlebury, he received his master's degree from the University of Chicago, and in 1939 began teaching at the University of Omaha. He left Omaha in 1942 when he took his Ph.D from Ohio State University. From 1942 to 1956, he was a professor at the University of Kansas City, whose English department he headed from 1952 to the end of his tenure, when he transferred to Brown University. John Shroeder, one of his students at Kansas, who later became a Brown English professor himself, recalled of Waggoner's lectures: > Hyatt had small classes. He taught in his office, sitting behind his desk. > There were no pyrotechnics, but he was inspiring. He had new and startling > ideas about literary matters [...]. He set people up well enough to continue > for themselves. And he was what students are always hoping for in a > professor. I always felt free to drop in on him and talk about literary > matters for two hours. He was always available. He gave exams on the porch > of his house and served beer. I make him sound sugary and sweet. He is > really a cranky Yankee. Waggoner went to a Unitarian Church in the 1940s but in the 1950s was Episcopalian. In 1943, he wrote a paper in the journal American Literature, exploring (without reference to its relevance in his own life) the effect of the incompatibility of science and theology on T. S. Eliot.Waggoner 1943, p. 101. A lover of nature, with a fondness for camping and hiking, he finally found a permanent home for his religious bent at a small federated church near his farmhouse in Rochester, Vermont. Here he wrote his books during summer holidays and sabbaticals, devoting all his time during the school year to his courses and students. His first authorial foray, The Heel of Elohim: Science and Values in Modern American Poetry, much along the same lines as the Eliot paper, was published in 1950, and William Faulkner: From Jefferson to the World followed in 1959, along with American Poets: From the Puritans to the Present (1968, a tome of 740 pages which emerged from one of his courses), Emerson as Poet (1974) and American Visionary Poetry (1982). He directed the American Civilization program all through the 1960s and retired from teaching in 1979. Bibliography * Waggoner, Hyatt Howe. \\"T. S.

The company was acquired by Maxim Integrated in 2011 for $164 million. SensorDynamics developed and produced custom-made designs and standard components for use in vehicle stabilization, occupant protection, navigation systems, keyless go systems and autonomous energy generators for wireless and battery free controllers for industrial, automotive and high-end consumer application. With its headquarters in Graz, Austria, SensorDynamics had offices in Italy and Germany and a worldwide sales and distribution network. The company employed about 130 people in 2011. History SensorDynamics was founded in 2003 by Herbert Gartner, Hubertus Christ, J√ºrgen Tittel and Volker Kempe. Financed by national and international Venture Capital investors the company successfully closed four equity rounds in 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In 2005 SensorDynamics was ranked under the top 100 European high tech companies by Tornado Insider and awarded the Fast Forward Award 2005 in Austria. From the beginning the Company strongly cooperated with the Institute of Silicon Technology Fraunhofer Society in Itzehoe and expanded this cooperation with long term agreements in 2007. In October 2007 SensorDynamics started a deep cooperation with US consumer electronics supplier Kionix. In August 2008 EnOcean and SensorDynamics announced the launch world's first energy harvesting system on chip SOC product. In March 2009 SensorDynamics launched MEMS gyroscopes for industrial, medical and consumer applications. In November 2009 Chipworks selected SensorDynamics' MEMS product SD755 as product of the year 2009. In November 2010 SensorDynamics announced XY angular rate and an XYZ angular rate devices in 6x6x1.8 mm3 QFN40-packages. In December 2010 SensorDynamics announced worldwide's first fully characterized and specified 6 x 6 x 1.2 mm 6DoF IMU (six degrees of freedom inertial measurement unit) including evaluation boards.

Maxim Integrated, headquartered in San Jose, California, is in Fortune 1000, and is included in the NASDAQ-100, the Russell 1000, and MSCI USA indices. Maxim was paying $164 million to acquire SensorDynamics. Product Portfolio SensorDynamics focused on three product groups, for each of which the company had created a development platform to guarantee a maximum re-use of silicon proven analogue and digital IPs. This was the basis for both application- specific developments and adaptations of existing products. Inertial microsensor systems SensorDynamics had developed and produced world's first MEMS combo sensors in combining MEMS motion sensors (angular rate and/or acceleration) with sophisticated analogue-digital electronics (ASIC) in micro packages to form a large-scale of integrated micro sensor system. Applications included electronic stabilization systems, rollover detection and navigation sets for ‚Äôblind reckoning‚Äô without GPS support. Intelligent sensor interface circuits SensorDynamics had a wealth of expertise in the development and manufacturing of intelligent electronic signal conditioning circuitry of macro sensors such as core and planar coils, resistors, capacitive and magneto resistive sensors. Cooperation with the customer produces application-specific sensor systems that combined macro sensors and electronic signal conditioning at module level. Wireless sensors Examples of wireless sensors were to be found in ‚ÄòKeyless go‚Äô or tyre pressure systems. However, wireless and battery-less sensor systems are increasingly adopted in industrial applications; especially automation such as smart LF/RF applications. Energy harvesting, in other words powering devices from the energy produced by movement, heat or light, was enabled by SensorDynamics' system on chip SOC products.

Paynter was a senior member of the team that ran Bomber Command under its formidable commander-in-chief, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, throughout the last three years of the Second World War. His reports, as head of intelligence, lay behind many of the raids on German cities, which remain the subject of controversy. Paynter insisted to the end that reliable sources had led them to believe that the Nazis had hidden large munitions stores in such historic towns as Dresden; Hitler thought that the Allies would not attack them. Family Noel Stephen Paynter had been born in Essex where his father, Canon F S Paynter, was rector of Springfield. But the family has a long history in West Cornwall, with a coat of arms dating from the 16th century and a place in Burke's Landed Gentry.Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of the landed gentry by Bernard Burke ‚Äì Heraldry ‚Äì 1965 (Page 706) He married Barbara Grace, daughter of artist Fredereick Hans Haagensen of London. They had two children, Francis and Rosemary. His brother Charles Theodore Paynter (Lieutenant, R.N.) was killed in when it was sunk in 1918 by coastal artillery near Zeebrugge.http://users.qld.chariot.net.au/~caffin_da/paynter/theop01.htm Military career Paynter had been carefully chosen for the post in 1942 after spending the previous three years as head of RAF Intelligence in the Middle East ‚Äì for which he had been mentioned in dispatches. He was to establish a close working relationship with his new chief, reflected in a painting by Herbert Arnould Olivier, now hanging in the office of the C-in-C RAF Strike Command, which shows Harris sitting at his desk with Paynter leaning across it at a briefing session. His loyalty to Bomber Harris, however, was evidenced more dramatically after the war, when Paynter was director of intelligence at the Air Ministry. Incensed by the Attlee Government's refusal to give Harris a place in the victory celebrations, he resigned his commission in protest. His decision meant losing ¬£100 from his annual pension ‚Äì a more significant sacrifice then than it sounds today. He was soon found a new job, however, as a director of MI5, and remained a senior officer with the Security Service until retiring at the age of 62 in the early 1960s. Paynter acquired the nickname 'Peter' while at Haileybury ‚Äî and was never known by any other name thereafter. He went from school to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned briefly into the Essex Regiment before being transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. Paynter served as a young pilot on the Western front in the later stages of the First World War, then took part in the expedition to Russia in the turmoil following the Bolshevik Revolution. He never forgot the atrocities which were being committed by both the Red and White Russian armies on hapless civilians. But he brought back a White Russian decoration: the Order of Saint Anna, awarded following a plane crash in which he dragged his co-pilot to safety. The First World War also left him with the legacy of two chunks of shrapnel, which remained in his body until he died. Paynter spent much of the 1920s as a pilot in the North-West Frontier Province of India. Then after four years at RAF Halton, he switched to air intelligence, a transfer of interest which was to shape the rest of his career. He went to Malta in 1934, returned to the Directorate of Intelligence at the Air Ministry, then left for Cairo in 1939. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath after the war. On retiring from MI5 to his home in rural Buckinghamshire, Peter Paynter entered the public life of his adopted county. He became at various times chairman.

He was ordained a priest 1947 and then taught for more than a decade in the seminary in Bari while earning doctorates in theology and canon law. He served in the office of the Holy See's Secretariat of State beginning in 1958 and then in the Vatican diplomatic corps. After working in the United States from 1962 to 1967 and then in India and Republic of China (also known as Taiwan nowadays), his assignments included apostolic delegate to Mozambique from 1974 to 1981; pro-nuncio to Zimbabwe from 1981 to 1985; pro-nuncio to Yugoslavia from 1985 to 1986; papal envoy for Eastern Europe from 1986 to 1990; nuncio to the Soviet Union (and its successor, the Russian Federation) from 1990 to 1994, and nuncio to Italy from 1994 to 1998.He was the first Apostolic Delegate to Mozambique and the first papal nuncio to the Soviet Union. His work in Eastern Europe coincided with the special interest the Vatican took in the region under John Paul II and the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Much of his work involved locating communities of Catholics that had survived under communism and in persuading governments to permit the Vatican to reestablish churches and especially to appoint bishops. After years of negotiation, he consecrated three bishops in Czechoslovakia in 1988. To locate Catholics in Vladivostok, he walked around the city in his cassock to make himself known. He was named Titular Archbishop of Truentum in 1975 and consecrated in February. Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal at a consistory on 21 February 1998. He retired that year. He died in his birthplace, Grumo Appula, on 31 May 2003. He was entombed in the Church of Santa Maria Assunta in Bari.

The blast dampers normally protect air inlets and exhaust penetrations in an otherwise hardened structure. Blast dampers are related or identical to blast valves, the latter name is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices as they relate to nuclear explosions. Operation Blast dampers usually employ some type of blade held open with tension from a spring. The damper blades close automatically when pressure overcomes the resistance offered by the spring. Various models differ in the amount of blast protection (e.g. 1bar/14.5psi or lower amounts of protection) and whether they stay closed after the blast or remain functional. Design Typical blast dampers are sized to match HVAC ductwork and provide proper airflow with low pressure drop. Common applications include protecting equipment and personnel of control rooms and accommodation modules in petrochemical and industrial process facilities onshore and offshore. Acid- and corrosion-resistant versions are often requested in these instances.

Bamford (1887 ‚Äì 9 August 1944) was an English professional footballer who played as a full back. Born in Horwich, he began his career in non-league football with Darwen before joining Burnley in 1909. He was part of the Burnley side that won the FA Cup in 1914, but then missed five years of his career due to the outbreak of the First World War. By the time league football resumed, Bamford was over 30 years of age, and found it difficult to regain his place in the team. After more than 150 first-team appearances for the club, Bamford left Burnley in 1920 to sign for Rochdale, where he ended his career. Biography Thomas Bamford was born in the town of Horwich, Lancashire in 1887 and spent the whole of his life living in the county of his birth. He died on 9 August 1944, aged 57. Career Bamford started his career playing as an amateur for Darwen in the Lancashire Combination. His performances attracted the attention of professional Football League Second Division club Burnley, who he joined on a free transfer in April 1909.Simpson, p. 485 He was originally signed as cover for the veteran fullback Fred Barron, and made his league debut for Burnley in the 3‚Äì2 victory over Blackpool on 25 March 1910.Simpson, p. 117 He played in the remaining eight matches of the season, but at the start of the 1910‚Äì11 campaign he found himself out of the side again thanks to the emergence of Scottish defender Thomas Splitt. Bamford made his first appearance of the season on 27 December 1910 in the defeat to Hull City, and went on to play 15 league matches in the remainder of the campaign.Simpson, p. 121 Bamford was John Haworth's first choice left-back for the first 13 matches of the 1911‚Äì12 season, but again found himself left out of the team in December 1911 following the signing of David Taylor, who had been a part of Bradford City's FA Cup winning side in that year.Simpson, p. 122 Bamford did not appear again for Burnley until 9 September 1912 when he played left-back against Hull City at Turf Moor. Following the departure of Splitt in October 1912, Bamford found himself reinstated into the team, but at the unfamiliar right-back position. He went on to enjoy his longest run in the Burnley side, playing 24 matches in the 1912‚Äì13 season as the team achieved promotion to the Football League First Division after securing a second-placed finish in the league. Bamford also played in six FA Cup ties during the campaign as Burnley reached the semi-finals before being knocked out by Sunderland following a replay.Simpson, p. 129 Following promotion to the top flight, Bamford played all 46 first-team matches in the 1913‚Äì14 as the side attained a respectable 12th-placed finish in the league. Despite starting his career as a left-back, Bamford became an established right-sided defender as Burnley built on their cup success of the previous campaign, beating South Shields, Derby County and Bolton Wanderers in the early rounds before atoning for their defeat to Sunderland in the fourth round. Bamford was selected in the starting line-up as Burnley defeated Liverpool 1‚Äì0 to win their first (and as of 2010, only) FA Cup title.Simpson, p. 131 The eleven players selected for that match had only ever previously played four first-team matches together and in fact never again lined up together after the Final. Bamford carried his first-place berth into the next season, again playing in every league and cup fixture in 1914‚Äì15 as Burnley finished fourth in the division, their highest league finish since 1899.Simpson, p. 72Simpson, p. 136 On 24 April 1915, Bamford played what turned out to be his final game in a Burnley shirt, a 0‚Äì0 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. From the summer of 1915 onwards, the First World War brought competitive football to a halt in England just when Bamford was in his late twenties and at the peak of his career. He continued to play for Burnley part-time in the Wartime Football League, making 34 appearances in 1915‚Äì16 and a playing a further three matches between 1917 and 1919.Simpson, p. 489 He served in the Army Service Corps during the war. When league football eventually resumed in August 1919, Bamford was 32 years old and could not regain his place in the Burnley team thanks to the emergence of young fullback Len Smelt.

Torrefaction of biomass, e.g., wood or grain, is a mild form of pyrolysis at temperatures typically between 200 and 320 ¬∞C. Torrefaction changes biomass properties to provide a better fuel quality for combustion and gasification applications. Torrefaction produces a relatively dry product, which reduces or eliminates its potential for organic decomposition. Torrefaction combined with densification creates an energy-dense fuel carrier of 20 to 21 GJ/ton lower heating value (LHV). Torrefaction makes the material undergo Maillard reactions. Biomass can be an important energy source. However, there exists a large diversity of potential biomass sources, each with its own unique characteristics. To create efficient biomass-to-energy chains, torrefaction of biomass, combined with densification (pelletisation or briquetting), is a promising step towards overcoming the logistical challenges in developing large-scale sustainable energy solutions, by making it easier to transport and store. Pellets or briquettes have higher density, contain less moisture, and are more stable in storage than the biomass they are derived from.  Process  Torrefaction is a thermochemical treatment of biomass at 200 to 320 ¬∞C (392 to 608¬∫F). It is carried out under atmospheric pressure and in the absence of oxygen, i.e. with no air. During the torrefaction process, the water contained in the biomass as well as superfluous volatiles are released, and the biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) partly decompose, giving off various types of volatiles. The final product is the remaining solid, dry, blackened material that is referred to as torrefied biomass or bio-coal. During the process, the biomass typically loses 20% of its mass (bone dry basis) and 10% of its heating value, with no appreciable change in volume. This energy (the volatiles) can be used as a heating fuel for the torrefaction process. After the biomass is torrefied it can be densified, usually into briquettes or pellets using conventional densification equipment, to increase its mass and energy density and to improve its hydrophobic properties. The final product may repel water and thus can be stored in moist air or rain without appreciable change in moisture content or heating value, unlike the original biomass. The history of torrefaction dates to the beginning of the 19th century, and gasifiers were used on a large scale during the Second World War.  Added value of torrefied biomass  Torrefied and densified biomass has several advantages in different markets, which makes it a competitive option compared to conventional biomass wood pellets. Higher energy density: :An energy density of 18‚Äì20 GJ/m¬≥ ‚Äî compared to the 26 to 33 gigajoules per tonne heat content of natural anthracite coal ‚Äî can be achieved when combined with densification (pelletizing or briquetting) compared to values of 10‚Äì11 GJ/m¬≥ for raw biomass, driving a 40‚Äì50% reduction in transportation costs. Importantly, pelletizing or briquetting primarily increases energy density. Torrefaction alone typically decreases energy density, though it makes the material easier to make into pellets or briquettes. More homogeneous composition: :Torrefied biomass can be produced from a wide variety of raw biomass feedstocks that yield similar product properties. Most woody and herbaceous biomass consists of three main polymeric structures: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Together these are called lignocellulose. Torrefaction primarily drives moisture and oxygen-rich and hydrogen-rich functional groups from these structures, producing similar char-like structures in all three cases. Therefore, most biomass fuels, regardless of origin, produce torrefied products with similar properties‚Äîwith the exception of ash properties, which largely reflect the original fuel ash content and composition. Hydrophobic behavior: :Torrefied biomass has hydrophobic properties, i.e., repels water, and when combined with densification make bulk storage in open air feasible. Elimination of biological activity: :All biological activity is stopped, reducing the risk of fire and stopping biological decomposition like rotting. Improved grindability: :Torrefaction of biomass leads to improved grindability of biomass. This leads to more efficient co-firing in existing coal-fired power stations or entrained-flow gasification for the production of chemicals and transportation fuels.  Markets for torrefied biomass  Torrefied biomass has added value for different markets. Biomass in general provides a low-cost, low-risk route to lower CO2-emissions. When high volumes are needed, torrefaction can make biomass from distant sources price competitive because the denser material is easier to store and transport. Wood powder fuel: * Torrefied wood powder can be ground into a fine powder and when compressed, mimics liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Large-scale co-firing in coal-fired power plants: * Torrefied biomass results in lower handling costs; * Torrefied biomass enables higher co-firing rates; * Product can be delivered in a range of LHVs (20‚Äì25 GJ/ton) and sizes (briquette, pellet). * Co-firing torrefied biomass with coal leads to reduction in net power plant emissions. Steel production: * Fibrous biomass is very difficult to deploy in furnaces; * To replace injection coal, biomass product needs to have LHV of more than 25 GJ/ton. Residential/decentralized heating: * Relatively high percentage of transport on wheels in the supply chain makes biomass expensive. Increasing volumetric energy density does decrease costs; * Limited storage space increases need for increased volumetric density; * Moisture content important as moisture leads to smoke and smell. Biomass-to-Liquids: * Torrefied biomass results in lower handling costs. * Torrefied biomass serves as a ‚Äòclean‚Äô feedstock for production of transportation fuels (Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process), which saves on production costs. Miscellaneous uses: * Several guitar builders have used torrefaction to obtain more dimensionally stable wood for guitar parts than traditional kiln- drying or air-drying provides, including Yamaha, Martin, Gibson, and luthier Dana Bourgeois.

Life Baptised at St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, London, on 13 April 1618, he was a younger son of Sir Adam Newton of Charlton, Kent, by Katharine, daughter of Lord-keeper Sir John Puckering. On the death of his elder brother, Sir William Newton, he succeeded to the title of baronet and estates. He was admitted at the Inner Temple in 1631, and received an MA from Cambridge on the King's visit there in early 1632. At the outbreak of the First English Civil War he raised a troop of horse for the king, and was present at the battle of Edgehill. After the king's defeat at the battle of Naseby, however he sought to make terms with the parliament, and in 1646 his fine was fixed (at ¬£1,273); the Commons on 13 July 1647 ordered his fine to be accepted, and pardoned his delinquency. He was about to join the king's forces in Essex in June 1648, when he was seized by order of the parliament, and only released on promising to live quietly in the country. In 1654 Newton inherited by deed of settlement the estates of his maternal uncle, Sir Thomas Puckering, on the death of the latter's only surviving daughter, Anne, wife of Sir John Bale of Carlton Curlieu, Leicestershire. He then assumed the surname of Puckering, and moved to Sir Thomas's residence, the Priory, Warwick, where in August he received a visit from John Evelyn. Both Puckering and his wife supported distressed cavaliers. At the Restoration Puckering was appointed paymaster-general of the forces. In 1661 he was elected as a Member of Parliament MP for Warwickshire. He held that seat throughout the Cavalier Parliament, and on 6 February 1679 he was elected as an MP for the borough of Warwick. His activity as a justice of the peace, together with his leniency towards the Roman Catholics, made him unpopular. In 1691 he gave the bulk of his library to Trinity College, Cambridge, and afterwards for a period was in residence there; this donation included the Milton manuscripts now in Trinity College Library. He died intestate on 22 January 1701, and was buried in the choir of St. Mary, Warwick. Family Lady Puckering, who died in 1689, was Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Murray, and sister to Lady Anne Halkett. Puckering proved a great friend to Lady Halkett, lending her money before her marriage, and fighting a duel in Flanders with Colonel Joseph Bampfield, one of her suitors, who was suspected of having a wife still living (he was wounded in the hand). After Lady Puckering's death, Puckering forgave Lady Halkett all her debts to him. Thomas Fuller dedicated a section of his Church History to Henry, eldest son of Puckering, who died before his father. As he left no issue the baronetcy became extinct, while the estate devolved by his own settlement upon his wife's niece Jane, daughter and coheiress of Henry Murray, groom of the bed-chamber to Charles II, and widow of Sir John Sir John Bowyer, 2nd Baronet of Knypersley, Staffordshire, for her life, with remainder to Vincent Grantham of Goltho, Lincolnshire.

Early life Shields was born north of the Missouri River in Kansas City, attended Park Hill High School and graduated from North Kansas City High School in 1964. At the University of Missouri - Kansas City, she received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1968, a master's degree in 1971, and a law degree in 1978.http://www.softrakdata.com/shields/about/About-Shields.pdf After serving as an assistant Jackson County prosecutor in 1978 and 1979 she went into private practice. Political offices She served on the Kansas City, Missouri City Council from 1987 until 1994, when she was elected county executive. While on the Council, she championed the 1% for Art Program and an ordinance to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. During her watch as Jackson County Executive, the county launched a $20 million renovation of county buildings, including the Jackson County Courthouse and construction of a visitor center at Fort Osage, and negotiated an extension that will keep the Kansas City Royals and Kansas City Chiefs at a renovated Truman Sports Complex through at least 2031. She instituted \\"green\\" policies that earned the county over two dozen environmental awards. Shields was the area's highest ranking Democratic elected local official, and a prominent supporter of John Kerry in 2004. As 2006 ended, Shields opted not to seek a fourth term as County Executive, but to run for Mayor of Kansas City in the 2007 Kansas City mayoral election. 2007 court case On January 6, 2007, the day before she was scheduled to file for Mayor of Kansas City (a race in which she was a frontrunner in the polls), she and her husband Phil Cardarella were indicted on federal charges of wire fraud in connection with the sale of their Sunset Hills house; prosecutors said the sale was at an inflated price. According to the alleged scheme Shields and her husband would receive $707,000 if they agreed to let an appraiser appraise it at $1.2 million with the appraiser and cohorts collecting the difference (the house had been on the market for $700,000) She claimed the charges were politically motivated by federal prosecutor Bradley Schlozman, who had been appointed by George W. Bush. At trial, it came to light that neither Shields nor her husband had signed any documents that were not entirely truthful, that crucial documents had been forged, and that the FBI had instructed one appraiser to perform a false appraisal and told the loan company to approve a loan without verifying values on the false appraisal. Shields and Cardarella were found not guilty of all charges, although co-defendant appraiser and co-horts were convicted. Thereafter, Shields‚Äîwho had lost the race for Mayor‚Äîbecame Executive Director of Westside Housing Organization, a non-profit organization that built and ran low-income housing. In 2015, she ran for City Council and was narrowly elected over an incumbent councilmember. She was re-elected in 2019 and currently serves as Chair of the Finance Committee.

This was followed by two years of diplomatic exchanges, starting with an instruction form Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione to Benedetto Aloisi Masella, the nuncio in Rio de Janeiro, to request the visas from President Get√∫lio Vargas. The visas were formally conceded by Vargas, through Brazil's Conselho de Imigra√ß√£o e Coloniza√ß√£o (CIC), on June 20, 1939. Strict conditions From the very beginning, the visas came with strict conditions, \\"some necessary, others obstructionist\\", which grew stricter over time.Morley, 1980, pp. 18-19. The visas were available to baptized Jews in Germany and other countries, but were required to submit a recommendation from the nunciature of their respective country.Morley, 1980, p. 19. The emigrants were further required to prove that their baptism had occurred before 1933. Protestant Jews were denied visas. Later conditions included a substantial monetary transfer to the Bank of Brazil and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. Role of Cardinal Innitzer In the face of these many hurdles, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna wrote to Pope Pius XII on February 4, 1941, asking for his immediate aid in granting the visas, in light of the beginning of deportation of 60,000 Jews of Vienna, at least 11,000 of whom had been baptized. A reply from Maglione outlined the various difficulties associated with such a step. Innitzer was not satisfied, and complained again later that month. Suspension of the program The visa program was suspended on September 3, 1940 and officially ended on November 20, 1941.Morley, 1980, p. 20. The fascist Spanish and Portuguese governments had already refused to issue travel visas for those using the immigration visas to Brazil. Innitzer updated the Holy See again on the increased pace of the deportations on May 20, 1942 and the Vatican tried for the last time to appeal to the Brazilian government in July 1942. Maglione wrote in December 1941 to the bishop whose request had initiated the project that: \\"as you have certainly been informed [...] many emigrants have departed and--I regret to say--from what I have been told, a good many of them, both by their improper conduct and alleged demands, have not corresponded to the concern which the Holy See has shown in their behalf\\". Lack of gratitude from visa recipients The emphasis of Maglione's letter was not on the failure of a diplomatic effort, but chagrin at the alleged conduct and lack of gratitude of the recipients of the visas. According to the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, by \\"improper conduct\\", Maglione could only have meant that the recipients had continued to practice Judaism.Gutman, 1990, p. 1136.Lesser, 1995, p. 151‚Äì168. Number of visas It is difficult to verify the exact number of visas that were issued. Only 1,000 visas were actually allocated to the Brazilian embassy in the Vatican, and most--although not all --were probably used. The remaining 2,000 in control of the Brazilian officials in Germany were never used, not even in the early months of the project. Maglione was \\"remarkably acquiescent\\" to the cancellation of the program and his response to the Brazilian ambassador about the possibility of reinstating the program in the future was \\"agonizingly impersonal and diplomatic\\".Morley, 1980, p. 21. Attitude adopted by Pius XII Morley views the importance of the Brazilian visa project as fourfold: first, in demonstrating the concern of Pius XII \\"primarily, almost exclusively\\" with baptized rather than unconverted Jews, and viewing their persecution primarily as an infringement on the rights of the Church; second, in exemplifying the reliance on diplomacy, even as \\"an end in itself\\"; and third, in showing the reluctance of the pope to disturb the status quo, \\"even when a staunchly Catholic country reneged on its promise to the Pope\\"; and finally, the use of prior failure as an \\"apologia\\" against later proposals to aid Jews.

This enzyme catalyses the phosphorylation of cone (color) photopsins in retinal cones during high acuity color vision primarily in the fovea.  More on GRK7  GRK7 is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases, and is officially named G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7. GRK7 is found primarily in mammalian retinal cone cells, where it phosphorylates light-activated photopsins, members of the family of G protein- coupled receptors that recognize light of various wavelengths (red, green, blue). Phosphorylated, light-activated photopsin binds to the cone arrestin protein arrestin-4 to terminate the light-activated signaling cascade. The related GRK1, also known as rhodopsin kinase, serves a similar function in retinal rod cells subserving dim light black-and-white peripheral vision outside the fovea. The post-translational modification of GRK7 by geranylgeranylation and Œ±-carboxyl methylation is important for regulating the ability of the enzyme to recognize color opsins in cone outer segment disk membranes. Arrestin-1 bound to rhodopsin in retinal rods prevents rhodopsin activation of the transducin protein to turn off photo-transduction completely. While cone visual transduction is much less well characterized, it is expected that arrestin-4 bound to GRK7-phosphorylated color photopsin prevents opsin activation of the transducin protein to turn off photo- transduction completely.

A new Primark store has opened adjacent to the Exchange. Other major stores within The Mall Ilford include WH Smith, New Look, Sports Direct, Clinton Cards, Burger King, Ryman, Poundland, Peacocks, 99p Stores, The Body Shop, Thorntons and GAME. More stores are located just outside the Exchange, including an Argos, Waterstones and the recently opened Primark. Structure It trades from three levels of retail, though its architectural design layout has resulted in the lower floor of retail being separated into two parts, meaning customers wishing to access both parts of the lower level have to travel between the sections via the middle level. There is also an upper level of retail and food court facilities accessed from the middle level. Transit between levels is via a series of lifts, stairs and escalators within the Mall; in addition, some stores trade from two or more levels of the mall. The design and layout of some of the stores is notable: the Marks & Spencer store is bisected by the Mall site: at ground level it is accessible from the High Road by its external doors either side of the Mall entrance, whilst on the middle level of the mall it is accessible from two entrances facing opposite each other (as in The Mall Bexleyheath). One of the two sides of M&S; is also publicly accessible from the Upper level of the Mall. However, one side closed in July 2015. TK Maxx was initially two separate stores facing each other on opposite sides of the Mall, but this has more recently been changed, with the extension of TK Maxx across the mall area to create a single unified store, in effect splitting the lower mall into three segments, with a third section around the Cranbrook Road entrance (by Wilko) which is now separated from the other main part of the lower mall by TK Maxx. Past architectural features of the mall were a, now defunct, granite floating sphere and a wishing fountain.

Currently, Carissa Karakaedos holds the position of the school's principal; Emily Spinucci and Fred Gallo share the vice principal position. History In 1948, Lynn's newly designated third secondary school, at the time referred to as the Lynn Vocational High School, held its first graduation ceremony, at which a class of 70 seniors were awarded diplomas by Mayor Stuart A. Tarr. Ralph W. Babb was the school's first principal, and he would remain principal until his retirement in 1950. Michael C. O'Donnell would then hold the principal/director spot until 1971, when he retired as well. In 1953, during that year's graduation ceremony, it was announced that the school would rename itself to \\"Lynn Trade High\\". This rename would be effective immediately upon its announcement, and the 37-member graduating class of '53 would be its first under the new name. In 1971, Lynn Trade High relocated to 80 Neptune Boulevard, hired James A. Pelley as its new principal, and renamed itself once again, this time to its current name.

Known primarily for her studio portrait photography, Edis‚Äô sitters ranged from royalty to politicians, to influential women, and local Norfolk fisherfolk. Edis was one of the first women to adopt the autochrome process professionally and became Britain‚Äôs first official female war photographer in 1919. Life Edis, born at 22 Wimpole Street, London, was the eldest daughter of Mary n√©e Murray (1853‚Äì1931) and Arthur Wellesley Edis, FRCP (1840-1893), a gynaecologist and senior physician to the Chelsea Hospital for Women. She grew up with her parents and younger, twin-sisters, Katharine and Emmeline until the sudden death of their father, aged 53, when Edis was 17 years old. Caroline ‚ÄòCarrie‚Äô Murray, daughter to Surgeon General John Murray, a well-known photographer in India, gave Edis her first camera and became the subject of Edis‚Äô first attempt at a photographic portrait in 1900. By 1905, Edis and her sister, Katherine, had opened a professional studio on Church Street, in Sheringham, North Norfolk. Katherine left the studio in 1907 when she married local doctor Robert Legat. Edis, however, continued to build the businesses and divided her time between studios in Sheringham and Notting Hill, London. Meanwhile Katherine pursued her photography privately and continued to show considerable skill in both black and white and autochrome photography. Edis married Edwin Galsworthy, a solicitor and director of Barclay‚Äôs Bank, in 1928 at the age of 52, and became stepmother to his two adult children Margaret Eleanor and Gerald Galsworthy.  Career  Edis's first studio on Church Street, Sheringham was purpose built for the Edis sisters by their uncle the architect Robert William Edis. It had a glass roof to allow in natural daylight which became an important aspect of her trademark style. In the 1930s her London studio was relocated to Ladbroke Square and a new studio was built in Sheringham on South Street. During her career she also opened smaller, temporary studios in Cromer and Farnham. Edis employed several assistants at her Sheringham Studio, the longest serving of whom was Lillian Page who did most of the Studio‚Äôs printing. Edis produced postcards of her work, featuring fisher folk, famous sitters and the photographer herself. Clients who ordered photographs would receive them mounted on branded card which was embossed with her logo. Edis took her first autochrome portrait in 1912 and became known for her colour photography. Edis patented her own diascope, a device for viewing autochromes which allowed them to be backlit. Edis won a medal with her autochrome, Portrait Study, at the Royal Photographic Society's 1913 exhibition, and became a fellow of the Society the next year. Edis was appointed an official war artist and photographed British Women's Services and the battlefields of France and Flanders between 1918 and 1919 for the Imperial War Museum. In 1920 she was commissioned to create advertising photographs for the Canadian Pacific Railway and her autochromes of this trip to Canada are believed to be some of the earliest colour photographs of that country. Throughout her career Edis photographed many influential figures of early 20th century society. Notable examples include authors Thomas Hardy (1914) and George Bernard Shaw (1936); prime ministers H. H. Asquith (1917‚Äì18) and David Lloyd George (1917) and the future King George VI (c.1920s). Edis photographed many prominent women at a time of great change for the role of women in British society including Elizabeth Garrett Anderson (1909), Nancy Astor (1920) and Emmeline Pankhurst (1920). As well as famous sitters, Edis produced many portraits of local working fisherman their families at her studios in North Norfolk. Working in fashionable seaside towns of Sheringham and Cromer, these fishermen became minor local celebrities in their own right.  Legacy  Edis died on 28 December 1955, and her ashes were interred at Sheringham Cemetery. Following her husband's death in 1948, Edis presented some of her portraits to the National Portrait Gallery, and many of her war photographs remain in the collection of the Imperial War Museum. In 2008 Cromer Museum acquired a collection of over 2,000 images which had been left by Edis to her assistant, Cyril Nunn, and now holds the largest collection of her work in the world. The first, solo, retrospective exhibition of her work was held at Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery in 2016-17.

While the country was never occupied by Nazi Germany, the regime of Marshall Ion Antonescu aligned itself with Hitler, and assisted the Nazi Holocaust.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.206-207 Efforts of behalf of Jews For his efforts to protect Romanian Jews, Cassulo was accorded the title of \\"Righteous among the nations by Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. In 1944, the Chief Rabbi of Bucharest praised the work of Cassulo on behalf of Romania's Jews: \\"the generous assistance of the Holy See‚Ä¶ was decisive and salutary. It is not easy for us to find the right words to express the warmth and consolation we experienced because of the concern of the supreme Pontiff, who offered a large sum to relieve the sufferings of deported Jews ‚Äî sufferings which had been pointed out to him by you after your visit to Transnistria. The Jews of Romania will never forget these facts of historic importance.\\" Cassulo is recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Israel's Yad Vashem memorial. According to Morely, as nuncio to Bucharest, Cassulo's \\"early efforts on behalf of Jews concerned almost exclusively those who had been baptized Catholic\\".John Morley (1980) Vatican diplomacy and the Jews during the Holocaust, 1939-1943. New York. p. 25. He passed on to the Vatican in 1939, but did not pursue, a project to emigrate the 150,000 converted Jews of Romania to Spain. From 1940 to 1941, his primary diplomatic responsibility was to protest various pieces of legislation insofar as they infringed on the rights of baptized Jews, particularly with respect to intermarriage and attendance of baptized Jews to Catholic schools, which were protected by the Romanian concordat. Overall, Cassulo was \\"reluctant to intervene, except for the baptized Jews\\". Morley argues that \\"his Jewish contemporaries might have exaggerated, in those years of crisis, his influence and efforts on their behalf\\" based on the difference between Jewish sources and the ADSS.Morely, 1980, p. 47. Diplomatic protests In his study of the rescue of Jews during the Holocaust, Jewish historian Martin Gilbert wrote that, Cassulo \\"appealed directly to Marshall Antonescu to limit the deportations [of Jews to Nazi concentration camps] planned for the summer of 1942. His appeal was ignored; hundreds of thousands of Romanian Jews were transported to Transnistria.\\"Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.207 Cassulo made three protests to Antonescu: on 20 November 1940, 2 December 1940 and 14 February 1941.Morley, 1980, p. 26. Jewish converts Five days after the last of Cassulo's 1941 diplomatic protests, Antonescu informed the nuncio of his signing a decree allowing students of any ethnic origin to attend their own religious schools. Morely wrote that \\"much more worrisome to the Vatican\\" was a March 18, 1941, decree forbidding the conversion of Jews to Christianity, with severe penalties for Jews attempting to convert and cooperating priests.Morley, 1980, p. 27. Again, Cassulo protested that this violated the concordat, but the Romanian government replied that the decree did not because it would only affect the \\"civil status\\" of baptized Jews. It became obvious to Cassulo that the motivations of converts were not solely religious, and he wrote to Rome: \\"it is clear that human motives cannot be denied, but it is likewise true that Providence also uses human means to arrive at salvation\\".Morley, 1980, p. 30. Nationwide statistics on Jewish baptisms are unclear, but they certainly rose to the level that the Romanian government became concerned. According to Morley, although Cassulo was \\"possibly the most active of the Vatican diplomats in matters concerning the Jews\\", his protests were limited to violations of the concordat, and thus to the rights of converted Jews.Morley, 1980, pp. 45-46. Morley judges him sincere in his belief that it was \\"God's plan\\" that the Holocaust increase the number of converts.Morley, 1980, p. 46. Last years Cassulo was named Apostolic Nuncio to Turkey on 3 June 1947.

S. Lewis. Plot When four children Lucy, Susan, Edmund and Peter stumble into an old Wardrobe they find themselves in a magical land called Narnia with talking animals, fauns, hags, the Wicked White Witch and the great lion Aslan. There they meet the friendly Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them on their quest to find Aslan the great lion. Only he can help save Lucy's friend Mr. Tumnus (the faun) from the White Witch. They have a fun mysterious time there, and ultimately end up ruling as kings and queens, until they end up back home. The Professor tells the children that they will return to Narnia one day. Production notes The rights to produce the television program were given to the Episcopal Radio TV Foundation in the mid-1950s when C.S. Lewis was recording the Episcopal Series of the Protestant Hour radio programs. Dr. Ted Baehr was elected President of the Episcopal Radio TV Foundation as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was preparing to be broadcast by CBS, and supervised the distribution of the subsequent video.

The name 'Khushpur' has two root words: 'khush' meaning 'happiness' and 'pur' meaning land. Father Felix, a European missionary founded this village in 1901. (Fr. Felix also founded other villages like Mariamabad in Shekhupura district, Francisabad in Shorkot, Jhang district in Pakistan.) ‚ÄúFelix‚Äù is the Latin word for \\"happy\\".

Life He was the son of Murray of Woodend, and uncle of William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart. He was early attached to the court of James VI of Scotland, and soon after James's accession to the English throne was appointed tutor to Prince Charles, then duke of York. On 26 June 1605 he was granted a pension of two hundred marks for life, and in July was presented, through the intervention of the Bishop of Durham, to the mastership of Christ's Hospital, Sherburn, near Durham. From that time he received numerous grants, and was in constant communication with Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Sir Albertus Morton, Sir Dudley Carleton, and others, many of his letters being preserved. Andrew Melville, when he sought his liberty in November 1610, placed the management of his case in the hands of Murray, to whom he refers as his special friend. In 1615 George Gladstanes, Archbishop of St. Andrews, made an unsuccessful attempt to get Murray removed from the tutorship of Prince Charles as for his religious views. On 13 March 1617 Murray was appointed a collector of the reimposed duty on 'northern cloth,' and allowed one-third of the profits. In August of the same year the king promised him the provostship of Eton, but his appointment was opposed on suspicion of his puritanism, and he received the post of secretary to Prince Charles instead. In October 1621 he was confined to his house for opposing the Spanish match. In February 1622 he was elected provost of Eton, but fell seriously ill in February 1622-3, and died on 9 April, aged 59. He left behind him five sons and two daughters, one the writer Anne Halkett. His widow, Jean, and a son received a pension for their lives. Murray was author of some Latin poems, printed in Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum, ed. 1637. He was eulogised by John Leech in his Epigrammata, ed. 1623, and by Arthur Johnston in his Poemata, ed. 1642. Family Secretary Murray married Jean Drummond, a daughter of George Drummond of Blair and Grissel Cargill, who had joined her cousin Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe at the court of Anne of Denmark. The Countess of Roxburghe was later the governess of the children of Charles I of England. Her cousins, another Jean Drummond, the eldest daughter of the Earl of Perth and later Countess of Wigtown, and her sister Lilias Drummond, later Countess of Tullibardine, assisted Roxburghe as royal nurse.William Drummond, The genealogy of the most noble and ancient House of Drummond (Glasgow, 1879), pp. 116, 196, 209-210, 212: Joseph Foster, London marriage licences, 1521-1869 (London, 1887), p. 954. Anne Murray, Lady Halkett wrote that her mother was \\"entrusted twice with the charge and honor of beeing Governese to the Duke of Glocester and the Princese Elizabeth; the first during the time that the Countese of Roxbery (who owned my mother for her cousin) went and continued in Holland with the Princese Royall; and then again when my Lady Roxbery died\\".John Gough Nichols, The Autobiography of Anne Murray, Lady Halkett (London, 1875), p. 1.

It is found in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, from Maine and Quebec south to northern Florida and west to South Dakota, New Mexico, and into Arizona and Texas. Its westernmost population from the semiarid Colorado Plateau region is rather distinct and was once considered a separate species, but is now regarded as a well-marked subspecies C. n. euphemia. Description and ecology Lectotype specimen of C. n. euphemia from above The wingspan is 70‚Äì85 mm; C. n. euphemia is distinctly larger (around 90 mm). The forewings are brownish gray above, evenly dark from base to tip or with the center somewhat darker, and varying geographically between somewhat paler and browner in the aridland population and darker gray marked with brown in the eastern individuals (see Gloger's rule). The hindwings are conspicuously colored in various hues of orange with roughly concentric black markings above. Their basal area carries a dense covering of thin dark hairs which stretches along the dorsum, making this area appear more brownish or reddish. Through the hindwing center runs a black band from the leading almost to the trailing edge; a similar but wider band runs close to and parallel with the termen from apex to tornus. The border of the black bands with the fairly narrow area of orange between them is not even, but has some deep and irregular scallops. The outer rim of the hindwing is lighter yellow than the rest; along the wing veins the outer black band extends to the termen as faint blackish stripes. The undersides are pale yellowish orange with black bands. As is typical for the hickory/walnut-feeding Catocala of North America, both foreleg and hindleg tibiae of this species are spiny, and the tarsi carry four rows of irregular rows of spines each.Nelson & Loy (1983) The old wife underwing (C. palaeogama, see below) is most easily distinguished by the thickly hairy hindwing bases - below as well as above, forming a fuzzy black patch on the upperwings - and the less scalloped, more angular orange/black border on the hindwing upperside. It is also distinctly smaller, with little or no overlap in wingspan. Adults of the nominate subspecies are found from June to October; C. n. euphemia adults are on the wing from July to August. The caterpillars feed on Juglandeae trees of the genera Juglans (walnut trees) - such as the butternut tree (J. cinerea) - and Carya (hickories). The westernmost population apparently does not feed on Carya (which is rare or absent in their range), and seems effectively to be limited to Arizona black walnut (J. major), and perhaps Texas black walnut (J. microcarpa) and their hybrids. Classification This moth is placed in the subfamily Catocalinae, either of the owlet moth family, Noctuidae, or - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed more strictly - of family Erebidae. Within the Catocalinae, it belongs to tribe Catocalini and - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed widely - subtribe Catocalina. Imago of C. n. neogama f. loretta from above The supposed C. euphemia was described surprisingly recently, over 100 years after the nominate C. neogama. This population, occurring in Arizona and New Mexico, differs visually from bride moths as originally described, and was for many decades held to be a distinct species. However, its range is altogether parapatric with that of the eastern bride moths, and the ecological differences are slight. Consequently, pending data to the contrary these two are held to be subspecies of one species now, with C. n. euphemia representing a range expansion (and perhaps even a post-Pleistocene one) outside the range of Carya. On the other hand, similar moths from Texas were described as subspecies C. n. loretta. They often are paler than C. n. euphemia if anything; however, except in lightness they resemble C. n. neogama even more strongly, and they do not form a geographically separate and distinct population. They are thus today treated as a pale local form of the nominate subspecies, with no formal taxonomic standing. Finally, some authors include the old wife underwing (C. palaeogama) in C. neogama. These two are recognizably distinct in appearance and widely sympatric however, and there is no good indication that they are just one species. In fact, C. neogama occurs at the type locality of C. palaeogama (the area around Baltimore, Maryland), while the southern limit of C. palaeogama (South Carolina) is around the type locality of the supposed C. communis, which was subsequently identified as specimens of C. neogama.Nelson & Loy (1983), and see references in Savela (2012) Footnotes References *Nelson, John M. & Loy, Peter W.

He was playing open-age football for top Bootle league side Seaforth Fellowship when he was just sixteen years old and signed for Formby United in August 1921, aged 17. After two seasons he moved to Southport for three years before moving to fellow Third Division North side Wrexham in 1927. He scored on his debut for the Welsh club, the only goal in a 1‚Äì0 win at Chesterfield, and became a mainstay of the team's defence. Bellis graduated to the Second Division to play with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1929, and was part of the championship-winning side of 1931‚Äì32. Bellis's stay in the top flight lasted only a matter of months before he joined Burnley in December 1932. He was soon awarded the captaincy. In the close season of 1935 Bellis joined his final league club, Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic in Division Three South. In 1937, aged 33, he left to join Wellington Town.

Stileman was the son of Major-General William Stileman of the Indian Army and the brother of Charles Stileman, later Bishop in Persia, and Leonard Stileman, a first-class cricketer. He joined the Royal Navy as a Naval Cadet in January 1874 and was promoted Midshipman in March 1876, being appointed to the screw sloop HMS Dryad on the North American Station. In 1877 he joined the ironclad screw frigate HMS Shannon on the China Station. He was commissioned Sub-Lieutenant in 1880. In July 1882 he joined the paddle-wheel despatch vessel HMS Salamis and served in the 1882 Egyptian Campaign. Until 1888 he successively served in the despatch vessel HMS Lively, the battleship HMS Temeraire and the gunboat HMS Condor with the Mediterranean Fleet, and then the cruiser HMS Rover in the Training Squadron. From 1888 to 1898 he was first lieutenant of successively the screw sloop HMS Mariner on the East Indies Station, the corvette HMS Hyacinth in the Pacific, the battleship HMS Collingwood with the Home Fleet, and the battleship HMS Royal Oak in the Mediterranean. In December 1898 he was promoted Commander and became executive officer of the battleship HMS Mars in the Channel Squadron. On 12 June 1902 he took command of the stoker training ship HMS Nelson at Portsmouth. He then commanded Portsmouth Naval Depot and was promoted Captain at the end of 1903 at a relatively young age. He commanded the cruisers HMS Vindictive and HMS Andromeda in the Reserve Fleet at Chatham, the battleship in the Home Fleet, and the armoured cruiser HMS Duke of Edinburgh in the Channel Fleet. He retired in September 1909 and was appointed Captain- Superintendent of the Watts Naval School at Elmham, Norfolk, which was owned by Dr Barnardo's Homes. He returned to service at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 as Senior Naval Officer at Liverpool. Shortly afterwards he was promoted Rear-Admiral. He held the Liverpool appointment throughout the war and was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours. After the war he returned to Watts Naval School and in 1920 succeeded William Baker as Director of Dr Barnardo's Homes, the third since Thomas Barnardo himself, holding the post until his final retirement in 1923. An enthusiastic Evangelical Christian like his father and brother, he later became Lay Deputation Secretary with the Bible Churchmen's Missionary Society. He died from a fall at his home at Upper Norwood in 1938.

It is loosely based on the Korean comic of the same name by Hyung Min-woo. In an alternate universe, humanity and vampires have warred for centuries. After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest lives in obscurity until his niece (Lily Collins) is kidnapped by vampires. The film was released on , 2011. The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who praised the film's visual style and art direction while criticising the movie's use of genre clich√©s, writing, acting, editing and action scenes ‚Äî although, some of its action scenes were praised. Plot A centuries-long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church. Despite the vampires' vulnerability to sunlight, and all of mankind's technological advances, the vampires' greater strength and speed made them impossible to defeat, until humanity sheltered in giant walled cities and trained a group of elite warriors, the Priests, which turned the tide. In the opening scene, a group of Priests enters the Sola Mira Hive but are ambushed by the vampires. As they attempt to retreat, one of their number is seized from behind, and their leader tries to pull him to safety, but is forced to let go and watch him dragged, screaming, back into the hive. Years later, the majority of the vampires have been killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of The Church. Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the sheriff of a free town, Augustine. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon‚ÄîPriest's girlfriend before he was recruited by the clergy‚Äîwere mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Church to reinstate his authority, but leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, insisting on maintaining the common belief that the vampires have been completely defeated, for fear of compromising the Church's authority. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess (Maggie Q) to bring him back. Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, which was thought to have been abandoned after the war. Priestess, one of Priest's team during the failed attack on the Hive, joins them at Sola Mira. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat (Karl Urban). When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all. The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment when she confesses her feelings for him, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes the cities are likewise protected by the sun, but Priest explains that the cities' massive clouds of smoke and ash have permanently deprived them of sunlight. If the train reaches one of the cities, the attack will be a slaughter. Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, threatens Priest, believing that Priest intends to kill her if she has been infected by the vampires. Priestess explains that he cannot do so, because Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen, stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by the Church. Lucy was never told the truth about her parentage. While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as the priest who was lost in the attack on Sola Mira. After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. On the tracks ahead of the train, Priestess battles several Familiars, but one of them destroys the detonator for the explosives. Instead, she mounts the explosives on her motor bike and drives it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in flames, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape. Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.

The film is based on the supernatural horror and action Korean comics Priest by Min-Woo Hyung. The project was first announced in March 2005 when the studio Screen Gems bought Goodman's spec script. In January 2006, Andrew Douglas, who directed The Amityville Horror, was attached to direct Priest. In June 2006, actor Gerard Butler entered negotiations to star as the title character, and filming was scheduled to start in Mexico on , 2006. Filming did not proceed and, by three years later, director Douglas had been replaced by Stewart, while Butler had been replaced in the starring role by Paul Bettany. Stewart and Bettany had previously worked together in the Screen Gems film Legion. With a budget of $60 million, filming began in August 2009 in Los Angeles, California, and it concluded in November 2009. The film was the most expensive production from Screen Gems, to that date, and as of 2018 is still tied for third-most expensive, behind only Underworld: Awakening and Resident Evil: Retribution. Tokyopop flew Min-Woo Hyung to where production was taking place so the comics' creator could visit the art department and discuss the film with Stewart. The film diverges from the comics in following a different timeline of events and adding elements of the sci-fi western, cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic science-fiction genres. The director described Priests vampires as not being human in origin, and humans bitten by vampires became familiars instead. There are different forms of vampires, such as hive drones, guardians, and a queen. Since the vampires were intended to move quickly, they were fully computer-generated for the film. While vampires are harmed by sunlight in most lore, the film's vampires are instead photosensitive, being albino cave-dwellers. Stewart said, \\"They are the enemy we don't really understand, but we fought them for centuries. They are mysterious and alien, with their own culture. You sense that they think and communicate, but you don't really understand what they are saying.\\" The director also called Priest a homage to The Searchers with the title character being similar to John Wayne's character and the vampires being similar to the Comanche. The animated prologue for the film was created by American animator and director Genndy Tartakovsky. The production team includes: * Michael De Luca * Josh Bratman * Shareena Carlson * Joshua Donen * Glenn S. Gainor * Steve Galloway *Stuart J. Levy * Mitchell Peck * Nicola Stern Theatrical release Priest was released in the United States and Canada on , 2011. The film's release date changed numerous times in 2010 and 2011. It was originally scheduled for , 2010, but it moved earlier to , 2010, to fill a weekend slot when another Screen Gems film, Resident Evil: Afterlife, was postponed. When the filmmakers wanted to convert Priest from 2D to 3D, the film was newly scheduled for release on , 2011. It was delayed again to , 2011, so the film could attract summertime audiences. Priest was released outside the United States and Canada on , 2011, in four markets. It grossed an estimated over the weekend, with \\"decent debuts\\" of in Russia and in Spain.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on reviews from 92 critics and reports a rating average of 3.9 out of 10 with a consensus that \\"Priest is admittedly sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror clich√©s\\". At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41 based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

Aired on Sunday evenings at 10pm, it featured big band music from the late 1930s and early 1940s through to the present day. Presented by jazz singer Clare Teal it regularly drew a weekly listening audience of 360,000. The programme was subsumed into a two- hour show after its content was merged with that of Big Band Special in September 2013. Show format The programme began shortly after the conclusion of the news at 10:00pm. Clare Teal outlined some of the artists who would be featured on that particular evening. The show often had a theme running through it by which many of the songs played were connected. The details of each song, such as composer, album on which it was available, etc., were given after it had been played and the information placed on the show's website after Sunday Night at 10 had finished. The show generally ended with the presenter reading out a list of big band concerts which would be held at venues around the United Kingdom during the coming week, after which the show concluded and handed over for the 11:00pm news. The edition was then available on the BBC website to be listened to again for the following seven days. History The programme began in 1998 and based its format on the long- running Dance Band Days presented by Alan Dell. Following Dell's death Malcolm Laycock began to present the show on Sunday evenings, and for many years it featured a mixture of music from British dance bands of the 20s and 30s and from the big band era. The first half of the show was usually dedicated to the British dance bands of artists such as Jack Hylton and Geraldo, while the second half would feature the music of bandleaders such as Glenn Miller and Tommy Dorsey. In addition, the show would feature interviews with occasional guests from the big band genre and a \\"Mystery Disc\\" where a piece of music would be played and listeners would be asked to guess the identity of a mystery artist. It would conclude with Laycock reading out a list of big band concerts taking place around the United Kingdom. In November 2008 the show's format was altered, switching the focus to mostly big band music, though it continued to close with the concert announcements. The decision to alter the show led to complaints from some listeners who believed Radio 2 was turning its back on its older audience. In July 2009 Laycock announced his departure from the station. He had been due to take a four-week holiday, but instead took the impromptu decision to leave after failing to negotiate a new contract. His announcement took his bosses by surprise. He presented his final edition of Sunday Night At 10 on 26 July 2009. His sudden departure prompted outraged listeners to write to Radio 2 controller Bob Shennan and even their local MPs in an attempt to bring him back. Shennan later said that he had tried to persuade Laycock not to resign, but without success. Laycock went on to claim in a newspaper interview that he had been constructively dismissed by Radio 2. The BBC denied this and said his departure had occurred because they were unable to meet his demand for a 60 percent pay rise. Clare Teal took over the show from the following Sunday, 2 August. The BBC said that the programme would continue, while Bob Shennan said that it would not be scrapped. Teal presented the programme until September 2013, after which it was merged with Big Band Special (also presented by Teal), creating a two-hour show airing on Sunday evenings from 9‚Äì11pm. This programme is also fronted by Teal. British dance band music made a return to the show from November 2009, albeit not to the same extent as previously. An entire show was also dedicated to the genre in December 2009.

The Aryan Circle is a white supremacist, Neo-Nazi prison gang spread throughout many U.S. correctional facilities. The Aryan Circle was founded by Mark \\"Cowboy\\" Gaspard in 1985 in the Texas Department of Corrections as a splinter group of the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas (ABT). During the 1980s the ABT had shifted focus away from overt crime towards religion. The Aryan Circle split from the Aryan Brotherhood to maintain criminal gang status and white supremacist beliefs, and to oppose black and Hispanic prison gangs. The gang began growing during the 1990s, becoming the second largest prison gang in Texas by 2008, with 730 confirmed members in state prisons. The gang also had operational presence in neighboring states and isolated members throughout the country. The Anti-Defamation League estimated their 2009 nationwide membership to be approximately 1,400, including 150 confirmed members in federal prisons.  Membership and identifiers Membership into the group usually requires an assault on an enemy of the organization. The Aryan Circle touts four tenets: brotherhood, solidarity, loyalty, and dedication; these beliefs are represented on each side of a diamond patch. Aryan Circle members sport common white supremacist/separatist tattoos such as swastikas, SS lightning bolts, and Celtic or Germanic symbols. The main patch of the Aryan Circle is a diamond with wood ingrade under the heart with a swastika and the letters \\"AC\\" in the center of a circle. However, due to the group being classified as a Security Threat Group, many of its members no longer have the patch tattooed. Older members will have a small circle just below their left pectoral. They also acknowledge each other with patch numbers.  Criminal activities  Aryan Circle members have been convicted of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute large amounts of methamphetamine.

It was designed by Captain D.R. Williams, of Covington, Kentucky, who later served as an artillery captain with a battery of his design. It was a breech- loading, rapid-fire cannon that was operated by a hand-crank. The barrel was four feet long and a 1.57-inch caliber. The hand crank opened the sliding breech which allowed the crew to load a round and cap the primer. As the crank was continued, it closed the breech and automatically released the hammer. The effective range was 800 yards but the maximum range was 2000 yards. Approximately 40 were made, to supply seven different Confederate batteries. These were made at F. B. Deane Jr. & Son, Lynchburg, Virginia, Tredegar Iron Works, Richmond, Virginia, and Skates & Co, Mobile, Alabama. At the end of the war, four examples of this gun were captured to send to West Point. The West Point Museum retained one gun. Other examples are now located at the Kentucky Military History Museum the Virginia Museum of the Civil War at the New Market Battlefield State Historical Park, and the Watervliet Arsenal Museum. During the early trials of the gun, the Richmond Daily Exchange dated May 20, 1862, reported that: \\"General Floyd attended a trial of the Williams' mounted breech-loading rifle, which is claimed will throw twenty balls a minute a distance of fifteen hundred yards\\". Some sources say it could fire 65 rounds per minute but accuracy was greatly reduced due to the manual loading. The Union troops did not know what the gun was. Some describe it as a rifled cannon. Others reported that it fired nails, probably on account of the noise the projectile made as it tumbled.

It dances; it snaps gracefully back and forth; the touches related.\\"  Biography   Early life and education  One of three children, Flowers was born in 1908 in Custer City, Oklahoma, to Mabel Flowers and photographer W.A. Flowers. He dropped out of school at age 16 and spent five years working at The Kansas City Star as a staff artist and photo retoucher. Pigs and pin-ups After a brief job with the Chicago American, Flowers moved to New York where he was a staff artist at the Associated Press. He created his first syndicated feature, Puffy the Pig, for AP Newsfeatures in 1930. The following year, he began drawing Oh, Diana! and introduced a pinup-style with Modest Maidens, both for AP Newsfeatures. Modest Maidens brought him a weekly salary of $25, which tripled the following year. During World War II, the gals of Modest Maidens learned first aid, dug in victory gardens, entertained GIs and served as wardens and lookouts. From AP to King Features Modest Maidens became so successful that William Randolph Hearst of King Features Syndicate wanted the feature and offered Flowers double what he earned at AP. However, AP held the rights, so Flowers simply renamed his panel Glamor Girls and signed on with King Features. Oh, Diana! was continued by Bill Champs and Phil Berube after Flowers left AP for King Features in 1945. Virginia Clark was drawing Oh, Diana! in 1947. Modest Maidens, was taken over by AP staff artist Jay Alan.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. Macmillan, 1947. At its peak, Glamor Girls ran in 300 newspapers. Flowers continued to draw the Glamor Girls daily and Sunday panels until his 1968 death from emphysema. Books During the late 1940s, some 200 Flowers cartoons were published in an Avon paperback. The initial print run of 200,000 copies immediately sold out, followed by a second printing of 215,000 copies.

He was one of several AIADMK figures to do so and soon after his move he was appointed as a state-level BJP vice-president. As an AIADMK candidate, Nagendran was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Tirunelveli constituency in the 20012001 Tamil Nadu Election Results, Election Commission of India and 2011 state assembly elections.

It is a development of the traditional overcoat of the Afghans, called the Pashtuns, which could be anywhere from jacket- to ankle-length, with full or partial sleeves. Modern Afghan coats originate from Ghazni province, situated between Kabul and Kandahar. The coats were made from sheepskins that were fully cured and tanned, colourful and finely embroidered with silk thread. They were first imported to the United Kingdom in 1966 by Craig Sams, who sold them through hippie boutiques including Granny Takes a Trip on London's King's Road. The Beatles visited the shop and emerged wearing the coats. Photographs of them in Afghan coats appeared in print media. They also wore them, inside out, for the cover picture of the Magical Mystery Tour LP. Demand took off and the artisanal makers of Ghazni could not keep up. Crude imitations from Iran and Turkey flooded the market. These coarsely embroidered and poorly cured imitations gave the 'Afghan Coat' its undeserved reputation for smelliness.

Kantor Prize for Secure Tolerance In 2018 the ECTR has announced the establishment of the Kantor Prize for Secure Tolerance and ECTR Research Grants. ECTR Announces Research Grants and Kantor Prize for Secure Tolerance A European Model Law for the Promotion of Tolerance and the Suppression of Intolerance The Model National Statute for the Promotion of Tolerance is a document prepared by a group of experts of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation (ECTR), which regulates the legal relationship in the sphere of tolerance. The Model Statute is designed for adoption by the respective national legislatures of European States, in order to confirm and clarify their adherence to the principle of tolerance. The purpose of the Model Statute is to fill a vacuum: although all European States are committed to the principle of tolerance, nowhere is this principle defined in binding legal terms. The principal challenge in preparing the Model Statute was to go beyond rhetoric and generalities, spelling out concrete and enforceable obligations that ensure tolerance and stamp out intolerance. The ECTR has presented this document in a series of meetings and seminars with international organizations, including the Council of Europe and the OSCE. As a result, there is currently a joint ECTR-European Council task force which is working on its implementation. In 2012 Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor introduced ECTR's proposals for a general law of tolerance, which was presented at an official ceremony in the presence of European Parliament President Martin Schulz, as well as the two recipients of the European Medal of Tolerance.

Its work is underpinned by economic research, statistics collection and policy analysis carried out by its in-house Research Centre, often in collaboration with researchers from academia, business and government. The Research Centre's programme of work focuses on environmental sustainability, road safety, efficiency, logistics, traffic congestion and infrastructure, among other themes. The Research Centre is headed by Mr Stephen Perkins (United Kingdom).. The ITF maintains the International Road Traffic and Accident Database (IRTAD), a comprehensive database of statistics related to road safety. IRTAD also acts as a permanent working group of the ITF. The ITF has adopted Resolution no. 97/4 on Reciprocal Recognition of Parking Badges for Persons with Mobility Handicaps, facilitating reciprocity when it comes to Disabled parking permits between its member states. In 2013, the ITF set up a Corporate Partnership Board (CPB) as a mechanism for engaging with the private sector and bringing a business perspective to the policy discussions.https://www.itf-oecd.org/corporate-partnership-board-members  Member states  { width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\"           width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\"           * width=\\"25%\\" valign=\\"top\\"           * |} Annual Summit Every year, the Annual Summit of the International Transport Forum brings together ministers from member countries and invited countries in Leipzig, Germany, to debate a specific, transport-related theme with leaders from industry, civil society and the research community. The 2018 Summit attracted 1300 participants from 74 countries, including 40 Ministers. At their Annual Summit, transport ministers of ITF member countries adopt an official Ministerial Declaration on policies relating to the Summit theme. Past Summits have focused on: * Climate Change (2008, Presidency Finland) * Globalisation (2009, Presidency Turkey) * Innovation (2010, Presidency Canada) * Transport for Society (2011, Presidency Spain) * Seamless Transport (2012, Presidency Japan) * Funding Transport (2013, Presidency Norway) * Changing World (2014, Presidency France) * Transport, Trade and Tourism (2015, Presidency New Zealand) * Green and Inclusive Transport (2016, Presidency Denmark) see Declaration by Ministers on Green and Inclusive Transport, 19 May 2016 * Governance of Transport (2017, Presidency Mexico)http://2017.itf- oecd.org/ * Transport Safety and Security (2018, Presidency Latvia)http://2018.itf-oecd.org/ * Transport Connectivity and Regional integration (2019, Presidency Korea) The 2020 Summit was postponed by one year due to Covid-19. The 2021 Summit on \\"Transport Innovation for Sustainable Development\\" will be held from 26‚Äì28 May 2021 in Leipzig, Germany, under the Presidency of Ireland.http://www.itf-oecd.org/summit Governance The International Transport Forum is administratively integrated into the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), but is politically autonomous and has its own governance structure. The ITF‚Äôs highest decision- making organ is the Council of Ministers of Transport (CMT). The CMT unites the Ministers of member countries with responsibility for transport at the Ministerial Session held during the Annual Summit in May of each year. The CMT is chaired by the Presidency country. The Presidency of ITF revolves annually among members, alternating between a European and a non-European country. The Presidency has a leading role in organising the Annual Summit taking place during its tenure. The Presidency is supported by two countries as the First and Second Vice-Presidency. The Vice-Presidency countries traditionally assume the Presidency in the following years. The direction of the work of the ITF is steered by the Transport Management Board (TMB). The TMB consists of representatives of ITF member countries and meets at least twice per year. The TMB is chaired by the Presidency country. Task Forces formed from TMB members assists the Presidency in preparing the Annual Summits. The Transport Research Committee (TRC) organizes and overseas longer-term research projects. The TRC consists of representatives of transport ministries (which are sometimes also the TMB representative) and in other instances of delegates from transport- related research agencies of ITF member countries. The Road Transport Group is a subgroup of European TMB representatives that oversees the distribution of European road freight transport licences under the so-called Multilateral Quota system and monitors compliance with the rules of the Quota system. The Secretariat is the executive organ of the ITF. It is based at the OECD's headquarters in Paris, France. The Secretariat is led by ITF Secretary-General Young Tae Kim (Korea). Kim was elected by the Council of Ministers of Transport of the International Transport Forum on 1 June 2017 and took office on 21 August 2017. He succeeded Jos√© Viegas (Portugal), who had led the ITF's Secretariat from 2012 to 2017.https://www.itf-oecd.org/korea%E2%80%99s-young- tae-kim-elected-new-secretary-general-itf Kim took office on 21 August 2017.https://www.itf-oecd.org/young-tae-kim-takes-office-itf-secretary-general . The Secretariat consists of five units: Research and Policy Analysis (RPA), Institutional Relations and Summit (IRS), Statistics and Modelling (STM), Communications (COM), and the Central Management Unit (CMU). It has around 60 staff members. History The International Transport Forum was created by the \\"Declaration on the Development of the ECMT\\" (\\"Dublin Declaration\\") agreed by Minister of Transport on 31 May 2006 in Dublin, Ireland.https://www.itf- oecd.org/node/18937 The Dublin Declaration evolved the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) into a global organisation, with associate member counties of the ECMT (Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, United States) accepting an invitation to become full members. A history page on the ITF website provides a timeline of the ECMT and ITF. The European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT; , ). was established by protocol on 17 October 1953 in Brussels, Belgium.https://www.itf- oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/protocole.pdf The ECMT remains the legal core of today's International Transport Forum.

It is found from southern Canada (Ontario and Quebec) through the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, ranging westward to Oklahoma and Arizona, northward to Minnesota and southwestward to Texas. Description and ecology The wingspan of adults is 35‚Äì40 mm. They are generally easy to recognize by the cryptically patterned forewings, the yellow background color of their hindwings, and the black pattern on the latter. This consists of a black band along the outer edge, save for the hindmost part where a separate black dot is found. Forewing hue varies a lot, but similar sympatric species usually have an additional black band running across the central hindwings. Unlike in many (but not all) other underwing moths, their tibiae are all spineless.Nelson & Loy (1983) Adults are on the wing from June to September depending on the location; they are often attracted to UV light at night. The caterpillars feed on oak (Quercus) species, including. Of section Quercus * Bur oak (Q. macrocarpa) * Chestnut oak (Q. prinus) * Dwarf chinkapin oak (Q. prinoides) * Post oak (Q. stellata) * Swamp white oak (Q. bicolor) * White oak (Q. alba) Of section Lobatae * Bear oak (Q. ilicifolia) * Eastern black oak (Q. velutina) * Northern red oak (Q. rubra) * Scarlet oak (Q. coccinea) Classification This moth is placed in the subfamily Catocalinae, either of the owlet moth family, Noctuidae, or - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed more strictly - of family Erebidae. Within the Catocalinae, it belongs to tribe Catocalini and - if the Noctuidae are circumscribed widely - subtribe Catocalina. The former subspecies C. a. lineella, which occurs to the north and east of the girlfriend underwing, is now again considered to be a valid species Catocala lineella (Little lined underwing or steely underwing). C. amica is the type species of Corisce, initially proposed to be a distinct genus. Given that phylogeny and monophyly of Catocala in its present circumscription are unresolved, and that the girlfriend underwing and its closest relatives look quite different from their supposed congeners, Corisce might ultimately be revalidated. However, C. amica closely resembles other more usually-colored Catocala in possessing no spines at all on the tibiae.Nelson & Loy (1983), Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) Footnotes References * (1983): The Underwing Moths (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) of Oklahoma.

The Commando was formed in June 1940 primarily from members of the Brigade of Guards. It was one of the units selected to be sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce. On arrival they became known as 'B' Battalion in an attempt at deception, not wanting the Axis forces to know there was a commando formation in the theatre of war. The commando participated in the Battle of Crete and around Tobruk before being disbanded in late 1941. After this, many of its personnel went on to serve in other commando units formed in the area, including the Special Air Service. History Formation Raised in June 1940 by Robert Laycock it was formed mainly from volunteers in the London district and included men from the Household Cavalry, Foot Guards, Somerset Light Infantry, Royal Engineers, Royal Artillery and the Royal Marines.Saunders 1959, p. 23.Moreman 2006, p. 12. In October 1940, as part of a reorganisation of the Commando formations, the unit was amalgamated with No. 3 Commando into a single special service battalion known as the 4th Special Service Battalion, under Laycock's command.Durnford-Slater 2002, pp. ix‚Äìx.Moreman 2006, p. 15. As a part of this organisation, the unit‚Äôs name was changed to 'B' Special Service Company.No. 3 Commando formed 'A' Special Service Company in this organisation. Durnford- Slater 2002, p. ix. In January 1941 the special service battalion organisation was disbanded and the commando designation was readopted.Durnford-Slater 2002, p. x. As a result, No. 8 (Guards) Commando were split from No. 3 Commando and raised back up to battalion strength. Initially, training was fairly rudimentary and consisted mainly of \\"forced marches and heavy pressure\\";Parker 200, p. 31. however, more evolved training in operating with assault landing craft was undertaken later on and No. 8 Commando moved up to the small seaside town of Largs, on the coast in Ayrshire, Scotland where they were billeted by the townspeople and remained for about a month.Parker 2000, pp. 31‚Äì32. The next move was to the town of Lamlash, on the island of Arran. Shortly after arriving there, though, Laycock had to disband an entire troop‚ÄîNo. 8 Troop‚Äîand most of the men were \\"returned to unit\\" as he felt that their training had not been up to standard.Parker 2000, p. 32. Nevertheless, the unit continued to train and at this time No. 8 Commando formed an experimental section, known as the Folboat Section, under Lieutenant Roger Courtney, who had convinced Laycock of the usefulness of the two-seat collapsible canoes by carrying out a mock raid on the Glengyle.The Folboat Section was later designated the Special Boat Section, a forerunner to the Special Boat Service that currently exists. Parker 2000, p. 32. Crete and Tobruk In February 1941, with an establishment of 38 officers and 502 other ranks, they embarked for the Middle East. Along with No. 7, No. 11 (Scottish), No. 50 and No. 52 Commandos they became part of Layforce and were redesignated 'B' Battalion of Laycock's brigade-sized force.Chappell 1996, pp. 15‚Äì16.Saunders 1959, p. 52. They did not take part in the unsuccessful raid on Bardia, but on 27 May 1941, after a previously unsuccessful landing attempt two days earlier, a detachment landed on Crete with 'A' Battalion (No. 7 Commando) and 'D' Battalion (Nos. 50 and 52 Commandos) in an effort to stem the tide of the German attack on the island long enough for the garrison to be evacuated.Saunders 1959, p. 55.Chappell 1996, p. 16.Parker 2000, pp. 50‚Äì52. Throughout a period of five days from 27‚Äì31 May they fought a series of rearguard (following behind the main retreating friendly force in order to prevent an advancing enemy force taking the retreating force from behind) actions around Sphakia, before they too were evacuated. By that time, however, there were few vessels left and as a consequence many of the unit's men were left behind and subsequently captured.Saunders 1959, p. 57. Of the 800 men from Layforce that were sent to Crete, only about 200 escaped. Following the evacuation from Crete, a detachment from No. 8 (Guards) Commando consisting of five officers and 70 other ranks was sent to Tobruk, which was at the time was under siege. In June the Allies launched Operation Battleaxe, an attempt to relieve the garrison. Within this situation it was decided that the commandos in Tobruk could be used to carry out raids against the positions facing them. In the middle of the month the detachment from No. 8 (Guards) Commando began carrying out patrols in an effort to become familiar with the terrain and to practice moving at night. It was then decided that they would carry out the a raid on an Italian position that was dominating the forward areas of the Indian 18th Cavalry. The position, which was known as the Twin Pimples, consisted of two small hills that sat close together and from where the Italians were able to observe the Allied lines.Saunders 1959, p. 59. It was to be a raid that was typical of what the men had been trained for, but which they had rarely been able to conduct since arriving in the Middle East. On the night of 17/18 July the detachment attacked the Italian position. It proved to be highly successful, being well-planned and executed. Using the cover of darkness and a carefully laid deception plan, the commandos managed to sneak up behind the Italians position on the hills, and move thorough the forward defensive pits unchallenged. In the end they advanced to within 30 yards of the headquarters before they were challenged, and when they finally were, the force rushed the Italian defenders with sub machine guns and grenades and quickly overwhelmed them.Saunders 1959, p. 60. They then withdrew from the position just before the Italians could call down an artillery barrage and returned to the garrison holding Tobruk. They suffered five casualties in the raid, one of whom later died of his wounds. Disbandment Soon afterwards the Tobruk raid No. 8 (Guards) Commando was disbanded.Chappell 1996, p. 17. Its parent formation, Layforce, suffering from the losses suffered in the early raids and the evacuation from Crete, and stymied by lack of resources, changing strategic needs and a lack of enthusiasm for their employment by parts of the British high command, became ineffective and was itself disbanded in August.Parker 2000, p. 53. Shortly after this, though, upon the insistence of Sir Winston Churchill, the Middle East Commando was raised from the remnants of LayforceParker 2000, p. 54. and some of No. 8 (Guards) Commando's personnel transferred this unit, while others, including David Stirling, Randolph Churchill, George Jellicoe and Roger Courtney went on to become part of other special forces units such as the Special Air Service, the Special Boat Section or the Long Range Desert Group.Shortt and McBride 1981, p. 6 & 9.

It was located at the junction of Liverpool Road and Brook Lane in Chester. History The station was opened on 31 March 1890 by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (which was renamed Great Central Railway in 1897). The station had an island with two adjacent side platforms because it served two routes. Services from North Wales or Seacombe with its ferry connection to Liverpool (using the Great Central Railway) could either terminate at Chester Northgate Station, the Chester terminus of the Cheshire Lines Committee, or continue on the through line to Manchester Central. The through lines, which linked Dee Marsh junction to the CLC route to Manchester, passed to the north of the island platform, whereas the branch lines that ran to Chester Northgate went to the south of the island platform. The station's four platforms were used as follows: # for westbound trains leaving Chester Northgate for North Wales or Seacombe (side) # for eastbound trains terminating at Chester Northgate (island). # for westbound through trains for North Wales or Seacombe (island). # for eastbound through trains bound for Manchester (side). Chester Liverpool Road also had a goods yard with sidings. Passenger services ceased on 3 December 1951. The station was completely closed . Even though steelmaking operations at the Corus plant at Shotton ceased in March 1980, freight continued to pass the former station on a double-tracked line until 20 April 1984. Goods services resumed on a single-track line on 31 August 1986 before final closure in the early 1990s. The trackbed is now a cycle way. The station was demolished in the 1970s. The site then became a coal yard. In the 2000s the area was completely redeveloped for a fitness centre.
