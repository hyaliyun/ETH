DVC is one of three publicly supported community colleges in the Contra Costa Community College District (along with Contra Costa College and Los Medanos College). It opened in 1949. DVC has more than 22,000 students and 300 full-time and 370 part-time instructors. History Diablo Valley College was founded in 1949 as East Contra Costa Junior College. The college enrolls over 22,000 students on two sites. =Grade-fixing scandal= In 2007, a six-year grade fixing scheme came to light with allegations that over 70 students used sex or cash as payment to student employees in the admissions and records office in exchange for over 400 grade changes. Many of these students have transferred to universities and in some cases may have already graduated. By November 2007, 49 students had been charged with misdemeanors or felonies over the incident, and at least one had accepted a no contest plea. A spokesperson for the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges said that although the scandal was a negative factor it would be unlikely to lead to the school's loss of accreditation. In the first trial resulting from the grade changes, former student employee Erick Martinez was acquitted of all criminal charges on September 5, 2008. Jurors reached that decision after concluding that prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable double that there was a definite link between Martinez and grade changes. Academics DVC is a ‚Äúfeeder‚Äù college to the University of California, Berkeley; California State University, East Bay; and St. Mary‚Äôs College. It ranks among the top five transfer colleges in California. In 2004, the top four transfer destinations were California State University, East Bay, San Francisco State University, UC Berkeley and UC Davis. DVC also offers a variety of occupational specialties, including hotel/restaurant management, culinary arts, dental technology and real estate. It has an active speech and debating team. Athletics DVC offers sports including men's and women's basketball, cross country, swimming and diving, tennis, water polo, baseball, football, lacrosse, track and field (men) and soccer, softball, and volleyball (women). Willie McGee played baseball for DVC in 1977, and would later win a National League MVP award in 1985. Pitcher Doug Davis also played in the majors from 1999 to 2011. Demarshay Johnson, a former DVC basketball star who went on to play for the University of Nevada, was named CCCAA 1st team All-State after the 2004-05 season. That season he led the CCCAA in blocks, averaging 5.2 per game, and was named Bay Valley Conference MVP. The DVC Viking men's lacrosse program was the first junior college club in California, forming in 2008. In 2013 DVC won the California Junior College Lacrosse Association (CJCLA) championship. College newspaper The Inquirer, the college's student-run newspaper, is produced on campus by the Journalism 126 class. The newspaper was forced to produce its paper off-site at the Contra Costa Times newsroom when a bomb- threat on October 24, 2006 closed the campus and access to the newsroom was restricted. The Inquirer won General Excellence awards from the Journalism Association of Community Colleges in 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The newspaper also won a Pacesetter award from JACC in 1999.

She was the first woman from Quebec and the second woman appointed to this position, after Bertha Wilson. Previously, she had been one of the first woman lawyers to handle divorce cases, and was the first woman appointed as a judge to the Quebec Superior Court and the Quebec Court of Appeal. During L'Heureux-Dub√©'s time on the country's top court, she earned a reputation as a steadfast feminist and supporter of minority rights. Because roughly 40 percent of the 254 judgements that she wrote were dissents, she became known as the court's \\"great dissenter\\".  Early life and career  L'Heureux-Dub√© was born Claire L'Heureux in Quebec City in 1927. She was one of four girls raised by a mother who spent fifty years as a quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis which developed when L'Heureux-Dub√© was only nine. L'Heureux-Dub√© attended the Ursuline Monastery of Quebec City and worked at a cod liver oil plant in Rimouski, Quebec, but quit when she was nineteen to continue her education. In 1951, she graduated cum laude from the law faculty of Universit√© Laval, despite facing gender discrimination such as not being given scholarships that were awarded to men of similar financial means. She then entered private practice in Quebec. From 1952 until 1973, she worked at L'Heureux, Philippon, Garneau, Tourigny, St-Arnaud & Associates, and was one of the first woman lawyers to work with divorce cases in the province. In February 1973, L'Heureux-Dub√© was appointed as a judge to the Quebec Superior Court, becoming its first woman jurist. From 1973 to 1976, she led a federal commission studying immigration problems in the province of Quebec. In October 1979, she was elevated to the Quebec Court of Appeal and was its first female jurist. In 1981, she, along with future colleague Rosalie Abella, published Family Law: Dimensions of Justice, about Canadian family law. After eight years and writing 1,200 judgements for the Quebec Court of Appeal, L'Heureux-Dub√© was elevated to the Supreme Court of Canada by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in April 1987.  Supreme Court  L'Heureux-Dub√©'s elevation to the Supreme Court in 1987 made her the second woman to sit on the country's highest court, after Bertha Wilson. According to L'Heureux-Dub√©, a fellow judge on the Supreme Court refused to speak to her for the first three months after her appointment before passing her a note saying he considered her to have passed her probationary period. L'Heureux-Dub√© is typically remembered as one of the most prolific dissenters of the Court. Her judicial view was atypical for her time and often clashed with the majority of the Court. Her writing style and her tendency to use social science research in her reasons made for opinions that were often notable for their sheer length. Among her more controversial decisions include her reasons in Moge v Moge,[1992] 3 SCR 813. where she took a major departure from the practised standard of judicial notice by allowing for a broad range of social studies data to be given judicial notice as a legislative fact. Another famous dissent was in Canada (AG) v Mossop,[1993] 1 SCR 554. where she alone acknowledged that the meaning of \\"family\\" is not fixed and should be read purposively to adapt to the changing times and it should include same-sex couples. In a style reminiscent of Lord Denning MR, in the case of Willick v Willick,[1994] 3 SCR 670. she quoted a dictum she made in an earlier judgment, with which she \\"most heartily\\" agreed. In the 1994 case Dagenais v Canadian Broadcasting Corp, L'Heureux-Dub√© disagreed with the majority opinion written by Chief Justice Lamer that there was no hierarchy of rights in Canada because Charter rights ‚Äì freedom of speech and the right to a fair trial in this case ‚Äì had to be balanced against each other. L'Heureux- Dub√© dissented, saying that in addition to CBC lacking a valid right to appeal to the Supreme Court, when freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial cannot be simultaneously fully respected, the latter should temporarily prevail. In 1998, L'Heureux-Dub√© was named president of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists. Her concurring opinion, endorsed by Charles Gonthier in the 1999 decision R v Ewanchuk,[1999] 1 SCR 330. became the focus of a very public debate with John McClung, an Alberta Court of Appeal justice who wrote the decision upholding the acquittal of the accused, which was then overturned by the Supreme Court ruling. Justice L'Heureux- Dub√©'s opinion described his ruling as showing outdated and stereotypical thinking. In response, McClung wrote a letter to the National Post attacking L'Heureux-Dub√©, describing her writing as overly personal and blaming her attitude for the rise in the suicide rate of Quebec men. This letter drew even more furor when it was pointed out that L'Heureux-Dub√©'s husband had committed suicide in 1978. A few months after the debate, L'Heureux-Dub√© heard McClung had fallen ill, and wrote him a supportive letter, for which he thanked her and which she considered to be the end of the debate. Later in 1999, L'Heureux-Dub√© wrote the majority decision in Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), holding that international law, even when its provisions were unincorporated into Canadian law, could still be a source from which judges could find the values and principles behind Canadian legislation. L'Heureux-Dub√© followed the decision in Baker with her majority decision in the 2001 case of Hudson v Spraytech & ChemLawn, holding that the precautionary principle should be seen as part of international customary law. She then ruled that the municipal government of Hudson, Quebec, was justified in banning Spraytech's pesticides and was not acting ultra vires the \\"general welfare\\" powers delegated to it by the Quebec provincial government. At the time of her retirement on July 1, 2002, L'Heureux-Dub√© was the most senior judge on the court in terms of time served. During her tenure on the court, she was regarded as perhaps its most controversial member, and as someone who usually only slept four hours a day so she could focus on her work. Critics labelled her a feminist, equal-rights ideologue because of her support for the battered woman defense, tax deductions for mothers in the workforce, expansive provisions for spousal support, and the protection of sexual-assault complainants' privacy. During her time on the court, she was a proponent of equality rights of women, immigrants, LGBT people, and other minority groups. L'Heureux-Dub√© heard more than 1200 Supreme Court cases, wrote 254 judgments, dissenting from the majority in about 40 percent of them, which earned her the label of the \\"great dissenter\\".  Post-Supreme Court activities  Shortly after L'Heureux-Dub√©'s July 2002 retirement from the Supreme Court at the age of 74, she took a Judge in Residence position with Laval University in Quebec City. L'Heureux-Dub√© also served as the president of La Maison de justice de Qu√©bec, a pilot project to improve access to justice in Quebec City which operated from 2004 until its 2006 closure after it failed to become financially self-sufficient. It sought to serve people who made too much to qualify for legal aid, but not enough to afford a lawyer by offering free services provided by mostly retired legal professionals. L'Heureux-Dub√© had been chosen to run the pilot project's administrative aspects and recruitment effort because of her devotion to social justice and her legal connections. In a 2013 report for the National Assembly of Quebec, L'Heureux-Dub√© led a committee that recommended that Members of the National Assembly should give up benefits such as a golden parachute severance package in exchange for a pay raise from $88,000 to $136,000. The report proposed that this exchange of benefits for a payroll increase would be \\"cost neutral\\". L'Heureux-Dub√©'s report also proposed that transparency in expenditures be increased by forcing all members of the assembly to disclose their benefits, allowances, and indemnities to the public. As of December 2015, the pay raise was still not implemented, though the transition bonus given to MNAs who leave their office mid-term for any reason had been removed. In February 2014, L'Heureux-Dub√© spoke in support of the proposed Quebec Charter of Values during public hearings in the National Assembly. She argued that it did not infringe on human rights and was an opportunity to make Quebec a secular society. She also believed that it would withstand a constitutional challenge, saying that women's right to equality trumped the right to wear religious clothing, which was not the same right as freedom of religion. She had earlier indicated in a 2013 Radio Canada interview that fundamental rights such as the right to life and equality should not be abrogated by other civil liberties which could be \\"reduced\\" in a \\"free and democratic society\\". In response to email questions from The Globe and Mail, L'Heureux-Dub√© also cited the thesis in Israeli judge and legal theorist Aharon Barak's book Proportionality that rights have to be given importance based on society's values.  Personal life and honours  L'Heureux-Dub√© married Arthur Dub√© in 1957 and gave birth to a son and a daughter. Her husband died of suicide in 1978. Her son Pierre died in 1994, and her other child, Louise, became a practicing lawyer. L'Heureux-Dub√© considered her judicial work as a refuge for the pain in her personal life by allowing her to compartmentalize her life. L'Heureux-Dub√© was appointed Queen's Counsel by the Province of Quebec in 1969. She was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003. In 2004, she was made a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec, in recognition of her legal career and her contributions to equality for marginalized communities in both Quebec and Canada.

Barnum's circus in the 19th century. A bearded lady (or bearded woman) is a term historically used to advertise female sideshow performers with naturally occurring beards, however, the term is often generically applied to any woman with substantial facial hair growth. Women who exhibit this facial hair trait have a condition known as hirsutism, or alternately, hypertrichosis. Hypertrichosis causes people of either sex to develop excess hair over their entire body (including the face), while hirsutism is restricted to females and only causes excessive hair growth in the 9 body areas mentioned by Ferriman and Gallwey.  Background  A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. The condition is called hirsutism. It is usually the result of polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess testosterone and an over- sensitivity to testosterone, thus (to a greater or lesser extent) results in male pattern hair growth, among other symptoms. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually androgen excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as hypertrichosis. In some cases a woman‚Äôs ability to grow a beard can be due to hereditary reasons without anything medically being wrong. There are numerous references to bearded women throughout the centuries, and Shakespeare also mentioned them in Macbeth: However, no known productions of Macbeth included bearded witches.Shopland, Norena 'A wonder of nature' from Forbidden Lives: LGBT stories from Wales, Seren Books, 2017 Sometimes it is caused by use of anabolic steroids. Cultural pressure leads most to remove it, as it may be viewed as a social stigma. The \\"bearded lady\\" is a clich√©‚Äîa staple of a carnival sideshow.  Race  Darwin‚Äôs ideas on sexual selection that influenced the perception of women with excess facial hair were applied differently across race. Black women who had excess facial hair were actually perceived as evidence of human‚Äôs evolution from apes, whereas white women with excess facial hair were perceived as diseased. A beard on a white woman only challenged her sex, whereas a beard on a black woman challenged her species. Some famous bearded women were Krao Farini and Julia Pastrana. Entertainment  Notable examples were the famous bearded ladies of the circus sideshows of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Barnum's Josephine Clofullia and Ringling Bros.' Jane Barnell, whose anomalies were celebrated. Sometimes circus and carnival freak shows presented bearded ladies who were actually women with facial hairpieces or bearded men dressed as women, both practices being lampooned by comedian and former circus performer W.C. Fields in the 1939 film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man.

She was built in Glasgow by Alexander Stephen and Sons. Her keel was laid down on 10 August 1936. She was launched on 23 September 1937 and commissioned on 7 September 1938. She was sunk by German or Italian aircraft on 14 September 1942, off Tobruk. Some sources credit Junkers Ju 87 \\"Stuka\\" dive bombers from StG 3 with her sinking. The ship's commanding officer testified that the ship was sunk by a combination of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s.

The ships' complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men for the Captain (D) and his staff.Whitley, p. 99 The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four twin-gun mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II \\"pom-pom\\" AA gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun.Hodges, pp. 13‚Äì25 The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self- defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships;Hodges, pp. 30‚Äì31, 40 Twenty depth charges were the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.English, p. 15 =Wartime modifications= Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals' anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace 'X' mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later.Friedman, p. 34; Hodges, pp. 41‚Äì42 To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.Whitley, p. 116  Construction and career On 4 August 1942, Zulu ‚Äî together with , and ‚Äî sank the German submarine off Haifa. Zulus commanding officer ‚Äî Commander R.T. White, D.S.O.* ‚Äî was Mentioned in Despatches for his efforts in sinking U-372. In September 1942, Zulu participated in Operation Agreement, a commando raid at Tobruk, together with cruiser and destroyer Sikh. She had the task of scuttling Coventry after she was damaged in an air raid. Zulu was sunk by enemy aircraft on 14 September 1942, after bombarding Tobruk, following the rescue of Sikh. Shore batteries hit Sikh which began to sink. White manoeuvred his ship to try to rescue Sikh and her crew, attaching lines to her to drag her out of danger, having laid a smokescreen. Sikh eventually sank but Zulu succeeded in saving the lives of a number of her crew. Aircraft continued to attack Zulu and she finally succumbed, sinking the following day. Zulu took forty casualties from these attacks: twelve killed, twenty-seven missing, and one member of the crew was wounded. The attack, according to her commanding officer, was carried out by Ju 88s and Ju 87s‚Äî12 Ju 87s belonging to III./Sturzkampfgeschwader 3 formed part of the attack.

Her first term began October 4, 1996, and her last term ended on November 3, 2008. Early life Spencer has been a resident of Huntsville since age 7. She graduated from Huntsville High School, and holds a bachelor of science degree from the University of Alabama. Spencer was the first woman mayor of Huntsville, and the first woman mayor of one of Alabama's \\"four main cities,\\" which also include Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery. When Spencer was first elected mayor in 1996, she was the co-owner of a local funeral home. Spencer is a former teacher in the Huntsville City School System. Spencer, who is divorced, has two children and four grandchildren. Mayoral career Spencer first ran for mayor in 1996, after then-mayor Steve Hettinger announced he would not seek another term. Spencer was supported by Hettinger, leading her runoff opponent, Larry Mullins, to attack both as agents of the status quo. Facing a field of ten opponents, Spencer made the runoff, which she won by a convincing 66%‚Äì34% majority. During her first term, Spencer garnered editorial praise for rejuvenating Huntsville's economic development. The Huntsville Times stated that her \\"string of recent successes is a whiff of the famous optimism and spirit that characterized the city for decades.\\" At the end of her first term, Spencer was re-elected without a runoff, taking 58% of the vote. In 2004, Spencer won a third term. During the 2004 campaign, Spencer came under attack on several issues. First, she was criticized for the state of Huntsville schools. She was also criticized for allegedly favoring the wealthier southern areas of Huntsville over the northern neighborhoods with larger minority populations. This criticism may have been reflected in voting results, in which Spencer failed to carry precincts in north Huntsville. Although forced into a runoff, she won that runoff with 55% of the vote. In January 2007, Spencer was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Huntsville/Madison County Chamber of Commerce. Later that year Spencer was embroiled in controversy when the fire chief she had appointed resigned after only 18 months on the job. It emerged that he resigned after Spencer confronted him over alleged sexual harassment for his conduct toward a city employee, for which the city was later sued. In 2008, this suit was settled, and the city reportedly was not required to make any payment to the plaintiff. Among the accomplishments for which Spencer claims credit are a Target Distribution Center, and the construction of Toyota's V-8 engine plant in Huntsville. She points to the opening of two new schools, and in her third term, the rebuilding of one high school, with others in the planning stages. Spencer‚Äôs plan for tax incentive districts, she asserts, have provided $75,000,000 for capital improvements to Huntsville City Schools. Spencer advocates volunteer involvement, and points to her own work in volunteer efforts such as the United Way, Community Free Clinic, Huntsville/Madison Co. Botanical Garden, and the Boys & Girls Club. In early 2008, Spencer found herself in election- year controversy when questions were raised about her conduct in the city‚Äôs role in relocating a homeless shelter from downtown Huntsville to a residential district several miles away. Residents near the proposed new location complained that Spencer committed the city to the move without notice to them, and homeless advocates complained that the new location was too distant from other services used by the homeless. Return to private life Former Huntsville city councilman Tommy Battle announced that he would challenge Spencer in the 2008 mayoral election. Spencer announced that she would seek a fourth term in 2008. In the municipal election on August 26, 2008, Spencer led Battle by 14,871 votes to 14,486. However, two minor candidates received 673 votes, preventing Spencer from attaining a majority, forcing a runoff with Battle. In that runoff, on October 7, 2008, Battle decisively defeated Spencer, by a vote of 21,123 votes or 56 percent for Battle, to 16,821 or 44 percent for Spencer. In her concession speech, Spencer said, \\"You have set the bar high with me. You bought into what we wanted to do, and I am so proud of you for it, because you don't do it alone.\\" References External links *The Official Re-Election Site for Huntsville Mayor Loretta Spencer 1937 births Living people Mayors of Huntsville, Alabama Women in Alabama politics Women mayors of places in the United States ","title":"Loretta Spencer"},{"id":"986940","text":"The Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, known today as the Chinese Exclusion Act (the duration of which has been dubbed the Exclusion Era), was an act passed by the Parliament of Canada, banning most forms of Chinese immigration to Canada. Immigration from most countries was controlled or restricted in some way, but only the Chinese were so completely prohibited from immigrating. History Before 1923, Chinese immigration was heavily controlled by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, which imposed a hefty head tax on all immigrants from China. After various members of the federal and some provincial governments (especially British Columbia) put pressure on the federal government to discourage Chinese immigration, the Chinese Immigration Act was passed. It went into effect on 1 July 1923. The Act banned Chinese immigrants from entering Canada except those under the following titles: * Diplomat * Foreign student * \\"Special circumstance\\" granted by the Minister of Immigration under Article 9 of the Act (This is the class that former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson's family fell under.) * Merchant The Act did not only apply to Chinese from China, but to ethnic Chinese with British nationality as well. Since Dominion Day coincided with the enforcement of the Chinese Immigration Act, Chinese-Canadians at the time referred to the anniversary of Confederation as \\"Humiliation Day\\" and refused to take any part in the celebration. Because Canada became a signatory following World War II of the United Nations' Charter of Human Rights, which the Chinese Immigration Act was evidently inconsistent with, the Canadian Parliament repealed the act on 14 May 1947 (following the proclamation of the Canadian Citizenship Act 1946 on 1 January 1947). However, independent Chinese immigration to Canada came only after the liberalization of Canadian immigration policy under the governments of John Diefenbaker and Lester Pearson, first by the elimination of restrictions based on nation origins in 1962, followed by the establishment of the world's first points-based immigration system in 1967. Redress and legacy On 22 June 2006, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper apologized in the House of Commons. The first phrase of the apology was spoken in Cantonese Chinese, the most frequently spoken Chinese language among Chinese immigrants. He announced that the survivors or their spouses will be paid approximately in compensation for the head tax. On 15 May 2014, then-Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark apologized in the Legislative Assembly. The apology motion was unanimously passed and aims to make amends for historic wrongs. Unlike the federal apology, no individual compensation was provided. However, was promised to be put into a legacy fund which would help legacy initiatives. The formal apology went through a three-month consultation period with various parties to help ensure that the apology was done properly. On 22 April 2018, then-Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia Gregor Robertson issued a formal public apology. The Act and its legacy have been the subject of at least three documentary films: * Lost Years: A People's Struggle for Justice (2011) by Kenda Gee and Tom Radford * In the Shadow of Gold Mountain (2004) by Karen Cho;Cho, Karen, writer/director. 2004.

The third named storm of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Carla developed from an area of squally weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward, and by September 5, the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla. About 24 hours later, Carla was upgraded to a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucat√°n Channel. Late on September 7, Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. By early on the following day, the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category 3 intensity. Resuming its northwestward course, Carla continued intensification and on September 11, it was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, Carla weakened slightly, but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O'Connor, Texas. It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12\\\\. Heading generally northward, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13, while centered over southern Oklahoma. Rapidly moving northeastward, Carla's remnants reached the Labrador Sea, Canada and dissipated on September 17, 1961\\\\. While crossing the Yucat√°n Channel, the outer bands of Carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western Cuba and the Yucat√°n Peninsula, though no damage or fatalities were reported. Although initially considered a significant threat to Florida, the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation, reaching no more than . In Texas, wind gusts as high as 170 mph (280 km/h) were observed in Port Lavaca. Additionally, several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts, with the most destructive twister, an F4 near Galveston, Texas, resulting in 200 buildings severely damaged, of which at least 60 were destroyed, and 8 deaths and 200 injuries. The aforementioned tornado is one of only two violent tornadoes ever recorded in a hurricane, with wind speeds in the tornado nearly 50% greater than Carla's peak intensity. Throughout the state, Carla destroyed 1,915 homes, 568 farm buildings, and 415 other buildings. Additionally, 50,723 homes, 5,620 farm buildings, and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage. There were 34 fatalities and at least $300 million (1961 USD) in losses in Texas alone. Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana, causing the destruction of 140 homes and 11 farms and other buildings, and major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings. Minor to moderate damage was also reported to 748 homes and 75 farm and other buildings. Six deaths and $25 million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla. Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states, especially in Kansas, where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned 5 people. Overall, Carla resulted in $325.74 million in losses and 43 fatalities. Meteorological history As early as September 1, a tropical disturbance - an area of convective activity - was observed tracking westward across the Caribbean Sea within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, an anticyclone was situated over the western Caribbean Sea at the upper-tropospheric levels. Surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on September 3. Thus, it is estimated that a tropical depression - a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than - developed about northwest of Barranquilla, Colombia at 1200 UTC. Initially, the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data. At San Andr√©s, winds shifted west at about , while barometric pressures dropped to . The Weather Bureau Office in Miami, Florida issued its first bulletin at 1600 UTC on September 4, while the depression was centered about east-southeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua. It is estimated that sustained winds reached 45 mph (75 km/h) at 1200 UTC on September 5, thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Carla, while located just northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios. A reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that Carla was continuing to intensify, with surface winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Radars reported an unusually large tropical cyclone, with convective bands extending about outward from the center. Around 0000 UTC on September 6, Carla passed near Swan Island, which reported a barometric pressure of about and wind gusts of 60 mph (95 km/h) from the southwest. Based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100 UTC on September 6 - namely a barometric pressure of - a bulletin issued by the Weather Bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had \\"probably reached hurricane intensity\\". According to post- season analysis, Carla reached hurricane status at that time. Radar image of Carla from WSR-57 in Galveston, Texas Shortly after becoming a hurricane on September 6, Carla curved northward in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. At 1200 UTC on September 7, the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane while located east-northeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico (actual use of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which was developed in 1971, was not in effect). Shortly thereafter, Carla crossed the Yucat√°n Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico. A strong high pressure area forced Carla to resume its original northwesterly course. Early on September 8, the storm strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane while located just north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Thus, Carla was the third major hurricane of the season. Carla was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 10, while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. Operationally, at 0000 UTC on September 11, Carla strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane while located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Six hours later, the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175 mph (280 km/h). However, a 2018 reanalysis concluded that Carla did not reach Category 5 intensity, and in fact only had maximum sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h), and this has been officially incorporated into HURDAT.https://ams.confex.com/ams/33HURRICANE/webprogram/Paper339830.html Late on September 11, Carla reached its minimum barometric pressure of . Later that day, the storm struck Matagorda Island, Texas (seven miles south of Port O'Connor) with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h). Carla rapidly weakened inland, and degenerated to a Category 2 hurricane on September 12, while passing just east of Port Lavaca. Six hours later, the storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane near Shiner, shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm between Taylor and Coupland. Beginning late on September 12, the storm curved just east of due north. After reaching Oklahoma early on September 13, Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located over rural Johnston County. The extratropical remnants of Carla moved rapidly northeastward and brought heavy rainfall to some areas of the Great Plains and Midwestern United States. By September 14, it entered Canada near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. It then continued swiftly northeastward across Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador, before the remnants dissipated over the Labrador Sea on September 17\\\\. Preparations Occurring a year after Hurricane Donna, officials in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September 7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September 8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600 UTC on September 9. An estimated 500,000 people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation in the history of the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90-100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall. Impact Carla spawned 21 tornadoes, the largest hurricane-related tornado outbreak on record at the time. However, it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, which spawned at least 120 tornadoes. Throughout its path, 43 fatalities and about $325.74 million in damage were attributed to Carla. Most of the impact occurred in Texas, where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category 4 hurricane. =United States= Texas A house destroyed by Hurricane Carla in Port O'Connor, Texas Abnormally high tides and storm surge was reported along the coast of Texas, reaching at least above mean sea level at many coastal areas between Sabine Pass and Port Aransas. The highest tide reported was at Port Lavaca, with large wave heights including in Matagorda, in Port Aransas, in Freeport, in Texas City, and in Galveston and Sabine. Because the storm was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall, Carla produced strong winds, especially near its path. The strongest sustained winds include in Matagorda, in Victoria, and . Additionally, the highest wind gust observations include in Port Lavaca, in Matagorda, and in Aransas Pass, Austwell, Edna, Port Aransas, and Victoria. Carla produced heavy rainfall in Texas, peaking at in Bay City. Other significant precipitation totals include at Scholes International Airport at Galveston, in Downtown Galveston, in Wharton, in Liberty, in Dickinson, in Flatonia, in Columbus, in Hallettsville, and in Smithville. Tidal flooding caused by Hurricane Carla The most significant damage to property occurred between Port Arthur and Corpus Christi. Port O'Connor, lying nearest to the location of Carla's landfall, was virtually destroyed. In Columbus, the \\"Ranch Drive-In\\" theater is destroyed by the storm and was never reopened after 6 years of operation. In Victoria, the highest sustained wind speed was , while gusts reached . About 4,260 homes were damaged, with around 500 severely damaged or destroyed. 43 businesses and 26 public buildings were also significantly impacted. Damage in the city of Victoria reached $10 million. Of the 21 tornadoes spawned by Carla, eight of them in Texas caused significant impact. On September 11, an F2 tornado near Bay City destroyed two radio towers and damaged several buildings. An F3 tornado injured three people and caused the destruction of one house and impacted three others in Jacksonville, resulting in $25,000 in damage. Another F3 tornado in Channelview, located east of Houston, injured 22 people, destroyed 18 homes and six commercial buildings, damaged 40 additional homes, and caused $200,000 in damage. In the early morning hours of September 12, a violent F4 tornado moved across Galveston Island along a 1-mile long, 100-yard-wide path (it crossed into Galveston Bay as well), severely damaging 200 buildings, of which 60-75 were destroyed, and causing eight deaths and 200 injuries. This was the first of only two known violent tornadoes ever spawned by a hurricane with the other one happening during Hurricane Hilda in 1964. A few hours later, an F3 tornado in the area resulted in the destruction of six houses and extensive, but lesser, damage. In Hardin, another F3 tornado damaged six homes. Several structures sustained impact during yet another F3 tornado in Fulbright. The final tornado occurred during the late afternoon hours of September 13 in Latex. It caused F2 damage, two injuries, and resulted in $2,500 in losses after damaging two houses and three garages. Sign showing the highest water level of Hurricane Carla in Galveston Then little- known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the weather bureau building in Galveston during the storm, live on-site storm coverage that would be imitated by later reporters. This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane. Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that \\"literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes\\", according to a fellow reporter. Broadcasting live at the Weather Bureau Office in Galveston, Rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic. He then held the map over the black and white radar screen, which put the size of Carla into perspective, saying that Carla was the size of the Gulf of Mexico. CBS was so impressed with Rather's work that he was offered the position of correspondent. Throughout Texas, Carla destroyed 1,915 homes, 568 farm buildings, and 415 other buildings. Additionally, 50,723 homes, 5,620 farm buildings, and 10,487 other buildings suffered damage. There were 460 injuries according to the American Red Cross, though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number, 465. The storm caused 34 fatalities in Texas. Causes of death include 20 people drowning, eight from tornadoes, four electrocutions, and one heart attack. Overall, damage in the state was \\"conservatively\\" estimated at $300 million. A breakdown of damage indicates $200 million incurred to property and $100 million to crops, mostly from unharvested rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus. Louisiana In southeastern Louisiana, abnormally high tides lashed the coast, though no beach erosion was reported. Rainfall was heavy, peaking at in Many. Other observed precipitation totals include in Baton Rouge, in Morgan City, in Shreveport, in New Orleans, in Lafayette, in Alexandria, in Jonesboro and West Monroe, and in Lake Charles. In the western portions of Louisiana, sustained winds peaked at and gusts reached . Only minor damage occurred, limited to roofs, glass, and downed tree limbs. Winds caused a local river to reach above flood stage. The 11 tornadoes spawned by Carla in Louisiana destroyed 140 homes and 11 farm and other buildings, while causing major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings. Additionally, 748 homes and 75 farm and other buildings suffered minor to moderate damage. Six fatalities and 199 injuries occurred, mostly related to the tornadoes. Damage in Louisiana totaled to about $25 million. A breakdown of losses include $6 million to agriculture, $5 million to buildings, $4 million to boats and beach property, $3 million to roads and bridges, $5 million to oil platforms just offshore, and $2 million in miscellaneous damage. Oklahoma Rainfall from Carla in the United States Carla and its remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to portions of Oklahoma. About of rain fell in Grant, Tillman, Washita Counties. Heavier amounts of at least fell in Atoka and Pushmataha County. Precipitation in the state peaked at in Kingfisher. More than 140 city blocks were flooded with up to in residential areas of Kingfisher and up to in business areas. 225 homes and buildings in the city suffered water damage. Throughout the state, damage in other areas included 90 homes and buildings in Tulsa, 50 homes each in El Reno and Oklahoma City, and 10 homes in Pawnee. Additionally, water inundation washed out several bridges and highways in northeastern parts of the state, leaving roads impassable. Sustained winds between and gusts up to were recorded in Oklahoma. Winds injured two people due to airborne debris. Winds and rain combined severely disrupted electrical and telephone services and caused $670,000 in damage, with $600,000 to property and $70,000 to crops. Illinois The storm dropped precipitation amounts of throughout northwestern Illinois, with a peak of in Mount Carroll. Thus, Carla is the second-wettest tropical cyclone in Illinois, behind only Hurricane Audrey in 1957. Additionally, up to fell in 24 hours. Severe local flooding occurred, especially in the northern portions of the state. Heavy property and agricultural damage occurred. Streets and basements were reported to have flooded, while bridge approaches and a few small bridges were washed out. Precipitation of in Chicago flooded about 60 viaducts and 1,000 basements. After the Chicago River rose , the lock gate to Lake Michigan was opened to release excess water. However, the abrupt onrush of water resulted in about $75,000 in damage to boats at Wilmette Harbor. Elsewhere in the United States Winds in Key West reached , while much of Florida reported rainfall from the outer bands of Carla. In Kansas, of rain in only 6 hours caused flash flooding. With a peak amount of in Haddam, Carla was the rainiest tropical cyclone in Kansas, until being surpassed by Hurricane Paine in 1986 as well as Tropical Storm Frances in 1998. Severe crop damage occurred, especially in areas of Chautauqua and Shawnee Counties and to the south of the Kansas River. Many highways were left impassable due to water inundation. A family of 4 drowned after their car was swept off a road near Waverly. A fifth fatality occurred after a car with one occupant was swept into a tributary of the Marmaton River near Fort Scott. The storm persistently produced winds of , causing further agricultural damage. In Nebraska, rainfall peaked at in Hubbrell, making Carla the rainiest tropical cyclone in the state. Heavy precipitation also fell in Missouri, especially in Brookfield, Lee's Summit, and Pleasant Hill. The maximum rainfall total in Missouri was in Concordia. One fatality was reported in Missouri, though the cause of death is unknown. Rainfall in Iowa peaked at near Chariton, making Carla the rainiest tropical cyclone in the state. Up to of rain fell in a 12-hour period in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, mostly between Cheboygan and Grand Rapids. However, the Weather Prediction Center indicated precipitation amounts of in Boyne Falls. Regardless, Carla is the wettest tropical cyclone in the history of Michigan. Despite, the rainfall, flooding in Michigan was relatively minimal, limited to an washed out dam in Traverse City. Precipitation in Wisconsin reached in Brodhead, causing Carla to rank as the wettest tropical cyclone in the state. Precipitation peaks in other states include in Alabama, in Arkansas, in Mississippi, and in Indiana. =Elsewhere= In Cuba, broadcasts reported severe flooding near Pinar del R√≠o, and in Los Colomas and Punta de Cartas. Offshore Honduras on Swan Island, a rainfall amount of was reported along with wind gusts up to 60 mph (95 km/h). The remnants of Carla brought tropical storm force winds to some areas of Canada. In Ontario, gusty winds caused power outages in the Clarkson-Port Credit area. Electrical services were are disrupted in New Brunswick, due to winds up to in Saint John. Winds of lashed Halifax in Nova Scotia, thus the Halifax Public Gardens closed for threat of falling trees and branches. Aftermath Shortly after the storm, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, a lifelong resident of Texas, toured the devastation in the state and met with officials from 18 different counties, remarking that \\"as always, Texans are arising to a challenge... We have suffered hurricane, tornado, and floods, but we in Texas are a bold and brave people.\\" After his report to President John F. Kennedy and Congress, $55 million was approved in aid for Texas, though Kennedy later requested an additional $65 million. President Kennedy issued a disaster declaration for Texas, allowing all jurisdictions in the state to apply for public assistance. The president also declared 6 parishes in Louisiana a disaster area. Helicopters deployed 88 United States Marines to Galveston to patrol devastated areas. A United States Navy task force composed of medical and construction work teams was also sent to the area. Members of the United States National Guard assisted refugees in returning to their homes and worked to prevent looting. Owing to the hurricane's intensity and destruction, the name Carla was retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced by Carol in the 1965 season.

She falls in love with a \\"gay√≥\\" (a non-gypsy man), Sebasti√°n - played by Colombian actor Manolo Cardona. From the moment they meet in the fishing village of Topolobampo (Sinaloa), it is love at first sight. However, their love is forbidden by the gypsy code and judged because of the racism that exists against Maria's culture. Other important characters include Salom√©'s grandfather (El Patriarca) and her mother Jovanka (Dolores Heredia), Rafael Dom√≠nguez (Carlos Torres Torrija), Padre Juan Dom√≠nguez (Sa√∫l Lisazo), Do√±a Victoria Dom√≠nguez (Saby Kamalich), Mam√° Pasca, Jon√°s (Erick El√≠as) and his father Drago, and Salom√©'s sisters Maria Sashenka and Mar√≠a Magdalena, as well as the iconic image of Santa Sara (Saint Sarah).

Kinds of prepositions  Though the prototypical preposition is a single word that precedes a noun phrase complement and expresses spatial relations, the category of preposition includes more than this limited notion. Prepositions can be categorized according to whether the preposition takes a complement, what kind of complement the preposition takes, on what side of the preposition the complement occurs, and whether the preposition consists of one word or multiple words. A preposition that takes a complement is called a transitive preposition, and one that does not is called an intransitive preposition. Traditional grammars, based on the work of classical Greek and Latin philologists, consider only transitive prepositions to be true prepositions and label intransitive prepositions adverbs instead. Since the twentieth century, linguists have begun arguing against the analysis of intransitive prepositions as adverbs. Otto Jespersen argues that just as verbs can be either transitive or intransitive (he sings, he sings a song), prepositions can be either transitive or intransitive (he was in, he was in the house). Linguists have also noted that phrases headed by intransitive prepositions have the same distribution (that is, occur in the same places) as prepositional phrases headed by transitive prepositions and that they do not have the same distributions as prototypical adverb phrases.Jackendoff, Ray. \\"The Base Rules for Prepositional Phrases.\\" A Festschrift for Morris Halle, edited by Stephen R. Anderson and Paul Kiparsky, Holt Rinehart and Winston, 1973, pp. 345-356.Jaworska, Ewa. \\"Intransitive Prepositions in Polish.\\" Papers and Studies in Contrastive Linguistics, edited by Jacek Fisiak, ERIC Clearinghouse, 1988, pp. 171-82. The prototypical preposition takes a noun phrase complement, but prepositions can also take clauses, adjective phrases, adverb phrases, and other prepositional phrases as complements. A preposition that takes a clause as a complement is called a conjunctive preposition.Aarts, Bas. Oxford Modern English Grammar. Oxford UP, 2011. pp. 154-158. Traditional grammars typically group conjunctive prepositions with subordinating conjunctions, but these words seem to have more in common with prepositions than subordinating conjunctions. Prototypical subordinating conjunctions, such as that, are meaningless on their own, tend to introduce clauses that function as complements, and can often be omitted (compare Ted says that the world is flat and Ted says the world is flat). On the other hand, conjunctive prepositions, such as because, contribute meaning, tend to introduce clauses that function as adjuncts, and cannot be omitted. A preposition whose complement precedes it may be called a postposition to distinguish it from more prototypical prepositions, whose complements follow them. Some grammars classify prepositions and postpositions as different kinds of adpositions while other grammars categorize both under the heading of the more common variety in the language. Thus, in the latter categorization method, postpositions may be considered a variety of preposition in English. Finally, a preposition that consists of two or more words is called a complex preposition. It is a matter of debate as to whether these groups of words each function as a single preposition (the complex preposition analysis) or the initial preposition simply takes a complement that contains another preposition. Traditional grammars and some dictionaries take this complex preposition approach, but grammars informed by work in linguistics vary in how they address these groups of words. While Bas Aarts, for instance, takes the complex preposition approach, Randolph Quirk and his colleagues suggest that there is ‚Äúa scale of cohesiveness‚Äù that ranges from sequences of words which behave very much like simple prepositions to sequences of words that behave like syntactically separate units. On the other hand, Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum explicitly reject the complex preposition analysis. They argue that though the close semantic relationship between behind and in front of may make an analysis in which in front of is a single preposition seem appealing, there is syntactic evidence against this approach. Consider the following: # It is behind the car. # It is behind. # It is in front of the car. # *It is in front of. If in front of were a single preposition in the same way as behind is, we would expect the fourth clause to be grammatical in the same way that the second is. The fact that the fourth clause is not grammatical suggests that in front of is not a constituent.Huddleston, Rodney, and Geoffrey K. Pullum. The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge UP, 2002. pp. 620‚Äì623. . Given the lack of consensus on the status of complex prepositions, they appear below in their own separate section. Prototypical prepositions The following are single-word prepositions that can take a noun phrase complement following the preposition. Prepositions in this section may also take other kinds of complements in addition to noun phrase complements. Prepositions marked with an asterisk can be used transitively or intransitively. * a\\"a 3.\\" American Heritage Dictionary, 5th ed., Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing, 2020, ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=a+3.

Written by Julio Jim√©nez, it was produced by RTI Colombia in conjunction with the Telemundo network and with the participation of Caracol TV company. In Colombia, it was broadcast by Caracol TV. It is based on the 1994 telenovela Las aguas mansas, also written by Jim√©nez and produced by RTI. Plot Bernardo Elizondo is the owner of a hacienda, where he lives with his wife, Do√±a Gabriela, and their daughters; Norma, Jimena and Sara (affectionately nicknamed Sarita), the husband of their daughter Norma; Fernando Escand√≥n, and his father-in-law, Don Mart√≠n Acevedo, a retired military man who is paralyzed. Norma and Fernando's marriage was arranged by Do√±a Gabriela to hide that Norma had been the victim of a rape, but the marriage is in name only and has not been consummated, due to her trauma. Apart from that, Gabriela is in love with Fernando, so she forces her daughter to marry him to keep him close. Although Bernardo is in love with Libya Reyes, a humble young woman, he knows that he could not marry her, since Gabriela, a very despotic woman and very old-fashioned, would never give him a divorce. In any case, he is determined to break with everything in order to live out his love for Libya, and he decides to formally appear before the young woman's brothers; Juan, √ìscar and Franco Reyes, who did not support the relationship but approve it, since the happiness of their sister depends on it. Unfortunately, Bernardo has a horse accident and dies. At the same time, Libya discovers that she is pregnant and finds out that Bernardo has died, so she decides to go to the Elizondo house after being convinced by her neighbor, the fruit maker Hortensia and her children, who take her to the hacienda to claim the money, although she is scared and not convinced if she should go. When she arrives at the Elizondo house, Do√±a Gabriela humiliates and despises her family. Libya flees desperate and commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. When the Reyes brothers find out everything, they swear to avenge the death of their sister and go to the Elizondo estate, but they do not find Do√±a Gabriela, so they decide to stay at the hacienda, posing as some bricklayers that Do√±a Gabriela has contracted to build a cabin for Norma and Fernando. This is achieved thanks to the Elizondo housekeeper, Eva Rodr√≠guez, who also wants revenge on Gabriela for having forced her to give up her only daughter, Ruth, for having kept her single and having no resources to support her. Meanwhile, Ruth grew up as the daughter of Raquel and Calixto Uribe, who could not conceive a child due to their advanced age; Raquel is a wealthy old woman and is Gabriela's best friend. By meeting the Elizondo sisters, √ìscar Reyes intends to convince his brothers to change their revenge plans and seduce the Elizondo sisters, to pay them with the same currency, although what he really intends is to get the Elizondo money to improve their situation. His brother Juan does not agree with their plans, but when he meets Norma Elizondo he changes his mind because they are instantly attracted to each other. This attraction makes Juan completely forget his revenge plans, but the couple will find many obstacles in the way that they must overcome. Eventually, Norma becomes pregnant with Juan and decides to hide her son's true father, since Fernando and Sarita, who totally hate Juan, know the whole truth, and they have no choice but to keep quiet. Franco has a relationship with a beautiful woman named Rosario Montes, who is a singer at Bar Alcal√° and is exploited and mistreated by his representative and lover, Armando Navarro. Instead, √ìscar is wrapped in the web of his revenge when he falls in love with Jimena Elizondo. Both are attracted and one day, by the decision of the two, they marry in secret, which causes a great stir to the Elizondo family. After they both start living together in his and his brothers' house, Gabriela discovers that Juan is the true father of the son Norma is expecting, and later both sisters discover that the Reyes are actually brothers from Libya, and they fell in love for revenge on their sister's death, so they decide to leave them forever and return to their family. On the other hand, Franco is hurt, since Rosario cheats on him and marries Armando Navarro. Without caring about his life, he marries Eduvina Trueba, an elderly lady who owns a hacienda, many companies, and a lot of money. On the same day of the wedding, she dies, leaving Franco as the owner of all his property. Months later, Franco meets Sara Elizondo, a woman who hates him to the core (at least that's what she says); after so many fights little by little he falls in love with her, although she was already in love with him. They all have their history, and each couple will fight for the same goal: to be together; but first, they have to face the opposition of their enemies, starting with Do√±a Gabriela who hates them; There is also Fernando, who also hates the Reyes, especially Juan, because he took his wife Norma, causing their divorce; D√≠nora Rosales, a woman obsessed with Juan and who becomes Norma's rival; Armando, who vows to take revenge on Franco for being with Rosario, and also Rosario, since his obsession with Franco does whatever it takes to separate him from Sara. After many fights and disappointments, the three couples decide to be happy and live their idyll. On the other hand, the Reyes forge a strong friendship with Ruth, who bears a striking resemblance to their deceased sister Libya (later it is discovered that such similarity is due to the fact that they were cousins, and therefore, Ruth is also related to the Reyes brothers ). Evidence of this friendship is presented when Ruth discovers her origins and runs away from home, being welcomed by the Reyes on their estate. D√≠nora goes crazy due to her obsession with Juan and kidnaps him, while Ruth decides to save him and both return to the Hacienda de Los Reyes. Later she finds out that Eva is her real mother and they decide to start a mother-daughter relationship. Gabriela, after being disappointed in Sarita, who had been her last hope for an exemplary daughter, decides to marry Fernando, despite the opposition of her daughters and Don Mart√≠n. Little by little, Fernando is gaining ground on the hacienda, destroying it, and begins to manipulate Gabriela at his whim. So much so, that in a strong discussion of Fernando with Jimena, he tries to rape her, but her mother does not believe her accusations and forces her to leave the hacienda. √ìscar finds out about everything and decides to give Fernando a beating, which further increases the tension between Gabriela and Fernando, with the Reyes brothers. Meanwhile, Norma discovers that Fernando is cheating on her mother, but she does not believe the accusations again. Fernando has a strong fight with Norma on the balcony of the hacienda, and when she tries to defend herself against him, she pushes him, which forces her to leave with her son from the hacienda and go live with Juan, whom she later marries in a small chapel. 'Final stage' One night, Sara decides to follow Fernando to demonstrate to her mother that she is not the type she thinks, and discovers that Fernando has a mistress living in a small cabin on the outskirts of the region. In that, Gabriela decides to accompany her another night and they discover that the woman with whom Fernando is cheating on her, is D√≠nora Rosales, but she decides to confront him on her own and denounces D√≠nora to the police. Fernando and D√≠nora, obsessed with money and having failed their plan to separate Juan and Norma, kidnap Gabriela in their own estate and force her to take Sarita out of it, then lock her (Gabriela) in the basement, and confine Don Mart√≠n in a psychiatric hospital without imagining what is coming. Raquel, after not knowing anything about Gabriela for several days, decides to go to the hacienda and discovers that she was kidnapped in the basement, and when trying to escape from the hacienda to go and tell the police about what happened, Fernando and D√≠nora send the henchmen of Armando Navarro, who is also complicit in everything, to be caught and, in the chase, Raquel takes the wheel and decides to crash her car with that of Armando's bodyguards, causing an explosion in which Raquel, her husband Calixto, his driver Guadalupe and Armando's two bodyguards die. Over the days, Raquel's lawyer reads his will, in which he says that his properties, his actions, his other accounts, and all his fortune pass into the hands of Eva Rodr√≠guez, Ruth's true mother. Mart√≠n meets Mrs. Hortensia, who was confined in the sanatorium and they escape to notify the others about what is happening at the hacienda. Juan, upon learning that Gabriela was kidnapped, decides to go save her without telling anyone but ends up being kidnapped along with Gabriela. In that, the police arrive and surround the house, but Fernando and D√≠nora use Juan and Gabriela as hostages so that they are not arrested. Armando, who was also at the hacienda at the time of the operation, decides to go out and negotiate with the authorities, but he goes crazy and decides to assassinate Franco Reyes. Rosario intervenes and is shot, while the police kill Armando. Meanwhile, Rosario manages to survive in the hospital and apologizes to Franco and Sara for all the damage caused. After Franco paid the sum that Fernando and D√≠nora had asked for the rescue of Juan and Gabriela, they decided to escape in the middle of shooting with the hostages and on the way D√≠nora decided to seek refuge in the swampy jungle. In the jungle, Gabriela apologizes to Juan for all the damage she has caused him and his brothers. When the police and the Reyes learn that Juan and Gabriela are in the swampy jungle, they decide to contact the Reyes' uncle, An√≠bal Guerrero, who when he arrives meets Eva, with whom he had a relationship, and turns out to be the father of Ruth. D√≠nora decides to seduce Juan, but he drives her away causing a fight which causes the two to wallow in the mud, causing D√≠nora to be bitten by a poisonous snake. Later, Fernando assassinates D√≠nora, since she is thrown on top of him, delirious with the poison, and her body falls into the swamp. At that moment, Juan and Gabriela separate from Fernando and find the exit, but at this point, he arrives and shoots Gabriela. When he wants to shoot Juan, Fernando falls into the quicksand; Then he uselessly asks Juan for help and dies. Later they are all rescued, and Gabriela accepts the relationship of her daughters with the Reyes and decides to put down the fence that divides both estates. Franco and Sara, finally at peace, marry through the church in the presence of all their loved ones. In the final scenes, you can see how Rosario sings in the Bar Alcal√°, and the three brothers and three sisters riding together in the field. And finally, everyone was able to live happily without worries.

The ninth tropical storm and seventh hurricane and major hurricane of the season, Hattie originated from an area of low pressure that strengthened into a tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 27. Moving generally northward, the storm quickly became a hurricane and later major hurricane the following day. Hattie then turned westward west of Jamaica and strengthened into a Category5 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of . It weakened to Category4 before making landfall south of Belize City on October 31. The storm turned southwestward and weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Central America, dissipating on November1. Hattie first affected the southwestern Caribbean, where it produced hurricane-force winds and caused one death on San Andres Island. It was initially forecast to continue north and strike Cuba, prompting evacuations on the island. While turning west, Hattie dropped heavy rainfall of up to on Grand Cayman. The country of Belize, at the time known as British Honduras, sustained the worst damage from the hurricane. The former capital, Belize City, was buffeted by strong winds and flooded by a powerful storm surge. The territory governor estimated that 70% of the buildings in the city had been damaged, leaving more than 10,000 people homeless. The destruction was so severe that it prompted the government to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. Overall, Hattie caused about $60 million in losses and 307 deaths in the territory. Although damage was heavier in Hattie than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people, the death toll from Hattie was less due to warnings. Elsewhere in Central America, Hattie killed 11 people. Meteorological history For a few days toward the end of October 1961, a low-pressure area persisted in the western Caribbean Sea, north of the Panama Canal Zone. On October 25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low; the next day, a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance. At 0000 UTC on October 27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46 mph (74 km/h). Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70 miles (110 km) southeast of San Andres, or 155 mi (250 km) east of the Nicaraguan coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie. After being classified, Hattie moved steadily northward, passing very near or over San Andres Island. A station on the island recorded a pressure of and sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), which indicated that Hattie had reached hurricane status. Late on October 28, a Hurricane Hunters flight encountered a much stronger hurricane, with winds of 125 mph (200 km/h) in a small area near the center. At the time, gale-force winds extended outward 140 mi (225 km) to the northeast and 70 miles (115 km) to the southwest. Early on October 29, a trough extending from Nicaragua to Florida was expected to allow Hattie to continue northward, based on climatology for similar hurricanes. Later that day, Hattie was forecast to be an imminent threat to the Cayman Islands and western Cuba. Around that time, a strengthening ridge to the north turned the hurricane northwestward, which spared the Greater Antilles but increased the threat to Central America. With the strengthening ridge to its north, Hattie began restrengthening after retaining the same intensity for about 24 hours. Initially, forecasters at the Miami Weather Bureau predicted the storm to turn northward again. Late on October 29, the center of the hurricane passed about 90 miles (145 km) southwest of Grand Cayman, at which time the interaction between Hattie and the ridge to its north produced squally winds of around 30 mph (50 km/h) across Florida. Early on October 30, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the increase in intensity, reporting winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The storm's minimum central pressure continued to drop throughout the day, reaching by 1300 UTC; a lower pressure of was computed at 1700 UTC that day, based on a flight-level reading from the Hurricane Hunters. Hattie later curved toward the west-southwest, passing between the Cayman Islands and the Swan Islands. Late on October 30, Hattie attained peak winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) about 190 mi (310 km) east of the border of Mexico and British Honduras. This made Hattie a Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, making it the latest hurricane on record to reach the status until a reanalysis of the 1932 season revealed that Hurricane Fourteen had a similar intensity on November 5, six days after Hattie. Additionally, Hattie was the strongest October hurricane in the northwest Caribbean until Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Hattie maintained much of its intensity as it continued toward the coast of British Honduras. After moving through several small islands offshore, the hurricane made landfall a short distance south of Belize City on October 31, with an eyewall of about 25 miles (40 km) in diameter. Based on a post-season analysis, it was determined that Hattie had weakened to winds of 140 mph (225 km/h) before moving ashore. The hurricane deteriorated rapidly over land, dissipating on November1 as it moved into the mountains of Guatemala. During its dissipation, Tropical Storm Simone was developing off the Pacific coast of Guatemala, however, later analysis concluded that Simone was not a tropical cyclone at all. Later, Tropical Storm Inga formed from a complex interaction with the remnants of Hattie and nearby disturbed weather. Preparations Upon initiating advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau noted the potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small vessels to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near or through the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate. Hurricane Hattie first posed a threat to the Yucat√°n Peninsula and British Honduras on October 30 when it turned toward the area. Officials at the Miami Weather Bureau warned of the potential for high tides, strong winds, and torrential rainfall. The warnings allowed for extensive evacuations in high-risk areas. Most people in the capital, Belize City, were evacuated or moved to shelters, and a school was operated as a refuge. A hospital in the city was evacuated, and over 75% of the population of Stann Creek fled to safer locations. After Hattie made landfall, officials in Mexico ordered the closure of ports along the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Impact alt=Black-and-white map of then-British Honduras showing hurricane damage. Despite predictions for heavy rainfall in the southwestern Caribbean, the hurricane's movement was more northerly than expected, resulting in less precipitation along the Central American coast than anticipated. In its early developmental stages, Hattie struck San Andr√©s Island, located offshore eastern Nicaragua, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and gusts of 104 mph (167 km/h). As the hurricane neared the island, the airport was closed due to tropical-storm-force winds. Rough seas and winds damaged private property and two hotels. Many palm tree plantations were devastated. The schooner Admirar, anchored in one of the island's bays, capsized during the storm. Overall, Hattie resulted in one death, fifteen injuries, and $300,000 in damage (1961 USD) in San Andr√©s. The hurricane was the fourth on record to strike the island, and of the four was the only to approach from the south. In the northwestern Caribbean, Hattie passed close to Grand Cayman with heavy rainfall. At least 11.5 inches (292 mm) of rain were reported on the island, including 7.8 inches (198 mm) in six hours. Winds on Grand Cayman were below hurricane force, and only minor damage occurred due to the rain. The interaction between Hattie and the ridge of high pressure to its north produced sustained winds of 20 mph (35 km/h) across most of Florida, with a gust of 72 mph (116 km/h) reported at Hillsboro Inlet Light; the winds caused some beach erosion in the state. The U.S. Weather Bureau issued a small craft warning for the west and east Florida coastlines, as well as northward to Brunswick, Georgia. Later, Hattie impacted various countries in Central America with flash floods, causing 11 deaths in Guatemala and one fatality in Honduras. The Swan Islands reported wind gusts just below hurricane force, resulting in minor damage and one injury. =British Honduras= Hurricane Hattie moved ashore in British Honduras with a storm tide of up to 14 feet (4.3m) near Belize City, a city of 31,000 people located at sea level; its only defenses against the storm tide were a small seawall and a strip of swamp lands. The capital experienced high waves and a 10 ft (3m) storm tide along its waterfront that reached the third story of some buildings. A trained observer estimated winds of over 150 mph (240 km/h), and winds in the territory were unofficially estimated as strong as 200 mph (325 km/h). When Hattie affected the area, most buildings in Belize City were wooden, and most of this type were destroyed. Offshore, the hurricane heavily damaged 80% of the Belize Barrier Reef, although the reef recovered after the storm. High winds caused a power outage, downed trees across the region, and destroyed the roofs of many buildings. Governor Colin Thornley estimated that more than 70% of the buildings in the territory were damaged, and more than 10,000 people were left homeless. Some shelters set up before the storm were destroyed in the hurricane. The hurricane destroyed the wall at an insane asylum, which allowed the residents to escape. High waves damaged a prison, prompting officials to institute a \\"daily parole\\" program for the inmates. Hattie also flooded the Government House, washing away all records. All of Belize City was coated in a layer of mud and debris, and majority of the city was destroyed or severely damaged, as was nearby Stann Creek. The hurricane left significant crop damage across the region, including $2million in citrus fruits and similar losses to timber, cocoa, and bananas. The year's production of sugar cane was also heavily damaged. About 70% of the territory's mahogany trees were downed, as were most citrus and grapefruit trees. The hurricane damaged several factories and oil rigs in the region. Damage throughout the territory totaled $60 million (1961 USD), and a total of 307 deaths were reported; more than 100 of the fatalities were in Belize City, including 36 who evacuated to a British administration building that was later destroyed in the storm. The government of British Honduras considered Hurricane Hattie more damaging than a hurricane in 1931 that killed 2,000 people; the lower death toll of Hattie was due to advance warning. Aftermath A British Honduras postage stamp alt=A rectangular postage stamp, denoting that the stamp is of the British Honduras and costs ten cents. In the center there is a picture of the terminal to Stanley Field Airport, with the words 'HURRICANE HATTIE' printed over it. At the bottom of the stamp reads 'Postage & Revenue'. After Hattie struck, officials in Belize City declared martial law. A manager of United Press International described Belize City as \\"nothing but a huge pile of matchsticks,\\" and many roads were either flooded for days or covered with mud. Doctors provided typhoid vaccinations to 12,000 residents in two days to prevent the spread of the disease. Due to the high death toll, officials ordered mass cremations to stop additional disease from spreading. At the city's police station, workers provided fresh water and rice to storm victims. Many residents throughout British Honduras donated supplies to the storm victims, such that an airlines manager described it as \\"taxing... manpower and facilities.\\" One airline allowed donations to be flown to Belize City at no cost. The city's three newspapers were unable to operate due to lack of power after the storm. By November5, Belize City's post office reopened on a limited basis, and all business initially remained closed. About 4,000 homeless residents from Stann Creek were moved by boat to the northern portion of the territory. Many homeless people from the Belize City area set up a tent city on bushland about inland, which was initially intended to be temporary. In December 1961, barracks were erected near a Red Cross Hospital to house the homeless in the camp. The site was named Hattieville and became a proper city, with utilities installed in the subsequent decade. About 200 British soldiers arrived from Jamaica to quell looting and maintain order. At least 20 people were arrested in the day after Hattie struck. The British government sent flights of aid to the territory containing food, clothing, and medical supplies. The House of Commons quickly passed a bill to provide ¬£10,000 in aid. The Save the Children fund sent ¬£1,000 to British Honduras, and the Mexican government sent three flights with food and medicine to the territory. Two American destroyers arrived in the country by November2, reporting the need for assistance. The USS Antietam remained at port for weeks after the storm with six medical officers and six Marine helicopters. Four other ships sailed to the territory to provide 458,000 lb (208,000 kg) of food. The United States government allocated about $300,000 in assistance through the International Development Association. The Canadian government provided C$75,000 worth of aid, including food, blankets, and medical supplies. In 1962, Jimmy Cliff released his breakthrough single, \\"Hurricane Hattie\\". By Hattie's one year anniversary, private and public workers repaired and rebuilt buildings affected by the storm. New hotels were constructed, and many stores were reopened. Prime Minister George Cadle Price successfully appealed for assistance from the British government, which ultimately provided ¬£20 million in loans. In the days after the storm, the government announced plans to relocate the capital of British Honduras farther inland on higher ground. Work on the new capital, Belmopan, was completed in 1970. On the 44th anniversary of the hurricane in 2005, the government of Belize unveiled a monument in Belize City to recognize the victims of the hurricane. Due to the destruction and loss of life attributed to the hurricane, the name Hattie was retired by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

Pepper alongside Roger Moore in the James Bond films Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), the sheriff in Silver Streak (1976), a Texas tycoon in The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (1977), the owner of the scandalous 1919 Chicago White Sox baseball team in Eight Men Out (1988), and, earlier in his acting career, a prison floorwalker in Cool Hand Luke (1967). Early life James was born in Spokane, Washington, the son of Grace (n√©e Dean), a teacher, and Harry James, a journalist. He grew up in Oregon in the Gladstone area of Clackamas County. James was a decorated World War II United States Army veteran. He served as an infantry platoon sergeant with Co. \\"A\\" 163rd Inf., 41st Div. He served forty-two months in the South Pacific from January 1942 until August 1945. His decorations include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts. Career James became well known for playing the comic- relief role of Louisiana Sheriff J.W. Pepper in the James Bond films Live and Let Die (1973) and The Man With The Golden Gun (1974). He played very similar characters in both Silver Streak (1976) and Superman II (1980). Years earlier he portrayed a serious character in The Reivers (1969), opposite Steve McQueen, playing a mean, corrupt country sheriff. Two years earlier he'd portrayed a hard-nosed Southern prison floor-walker in Cool Hand Luke (1967). In Juggernaut (1974) he portrayed one of the first passengers aboard the luxury liner to realize there was a serious problem with the ship. James was the district attorney who prosecuted Al Capone in the film The Untouchables (1987). He played a Navy master-at-arms in The Last Detail (1973), starring Jack Nicholson, and Chicago White Sox baseball team owner Charles Comiskey in the true story Eight Men Out (1988), a drama about the corrupt 1919 Chicago White Sox. Despite being born in the Northwest and spending much of his life in New York (where he was an Actors Studio member of long standing),Actors Studio Recordings, 1956-1969, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison James was cast as a Southerner in many of his screen roles, such as his appearances in the James Bond films, and as powerful Houston lawyer Striker Bellman in the daytime soap opera Texas from 1981 to 1982. James again portrayed a Southern character when he played Sheriff Lester Crabb, a temporary one-off replacement for regular Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) in the second season Dukes of Hazzard episode \\"Treasure of Hazzard\\" (1980). He appeared on 13 episodes of the sitcom Lewis & Clark in 1981‚Äì1982. Other television credits include the 1976 private-eye drama City of Angels and the miniseries Captains and the Kings (1976). He appeared in two episodes of The A-Team: as murderous prison warden Beale in the first-season episode \\"Pros and Cons\\" (1983) and as corrupt Sheriff Jake Dawson in the second season's \\"The White Ballot\\" (1983). In 1996, he played the role of Red Kilgreen on All My Children. James appeared in the 1979 pilot episode of Hart to Hart playing the part of a highway cop. James also played the train passenger Wilkes on the Gunsmoke episode \\"Snow Train\\" (1970). His other film roles include those of a wealthy Montana land baron whose cattle are being rustled in Rancho Deluxe (1975) and as the source who tips off a newspaperman to a potentially explosive story in The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). James was featured a number of times by writer-director John Sayles, including Eight Men Out (1988), Lone Star (1996) and Sunshine State (2002). James' last known film appearance was in Raising Flagg (2006), although he had been cast in a starring role to appear in the feature film Old Soldiers, playing a true-to-life elderly veteran of World War II.http://www.old-soldiers-movie.com/ Production on that film was halted in 2016. Personal life James married twice: to Donna Lea Beach from 1948 to 1950, with whom he had one child, and to Laurie Harper, from 1951 until her death in 2015, with whom he had five children. He resided in Gladstone, Oregon, and died from complications of diabetes on April 15, 2017, aged 96.Clifton James, Sheriff in James Bond Films, Dies at 96 Variety, April 15, 2017 Selected filmography  *The Strange One (1957) as Colonel Ramsey *The Last Mile (1959) as Harris *Something Wild (1961) as Detective Bogart *Experiment in Terror (1962) as Capt.

The former Netherlands Antilles islands of Cura√ßao and Aruba are known for their typical waltzes, danzas, mazurkas and a kind of music called tumba, which is named after the conga drums that accompany it. The remaining islands are much smaller than Aruba, Bonaire, and Cura√ßao. They are Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Saba. Sint Eustatius has little nightlife, with only one nightclub (the zouk Largo Height Disco)Entertainment, CaribTourism.net as of 1996. The inhabitants, \\"Statians\\", hold impromptu street dances called \\"road blocks\\", using booming car stereos. Saba has a number of dances at various restaurants, including a wide variety of hip hop, calypso, soca, kompa, zouk, bouyon, reggae and merengue. Sint Maarten has a well-known Carnival tradition featuring music and dance, held in mid-April and culminating in the traditional burning of King Moui-Moui, as well as a number of nightclubs and casinos featuring music; popular \\"spots\\" where locals go to dance include Boo Boo Jam and Lago Height, both located on the northern (French) part of Sint Maarten; the most popular recent casino band is King Bo-Bo, known as the \\"King of Calypso\\".Cameron, pp. 549 - 582.  Modern Aruban music  Music is very closely connected to the Aruban culture, and plays a major role in holidays, carnivals and informal celebrations. Carnival music originated in Trinidad in the late 18th century, and combines romantic themes, calypso-inspired tunes, and drums from tumba. Other Aruban celebrations that are based around music include Dera Gai, Dande, Gaita and Aguinaldo.  Music of Cura√ßao   Traditional music on Bonaire  The island of Bonaire is known for an array of dances, including the Bari and Simadan. Imported polka, carioca, rumba, merengue, danza, joropo, jazz waltz and mazurka are also popular. The Baile di Sinta is a popular fertility dance, performed around a maypole. Traditional African work songs on Bonaire evolved over time into ritual songs with complex dances, instrumentation and polyphony.Bonaire Culture The Bari, performed during the festival of the same name, as well as at other times, is led by a single singer who improvises lyrics commenting on local events and figures (such a singer is similar to a calypsonian). Confusingly, the Bari dance, which is performed during the Bari festival, is accompanied by a bongo-like drum called a Bari. The first part of the dance features men competing in a stylized, ritual dance for women, followed by a part where the couples dance, though they don't touch (it is similar to tumba). After the sorghum harvest in February through April, the Simadan festival is held to celebrate, with the wapa, a rhythmic, shuffling dance, accompanying the celebration. Simadan's traditional songs include three call-and-response forms, the Dan Simadan, Belua and Remailo. These use instruments including the bari, wiri, karko, quarta, guitar, triangle and clapping.

Counting sequences and isomorphism The counting sequence of a combinatorial class is the sequence of the numbers of elements of size i for i = 0, 1, 2, ...; it may also be described as a generating function that has these numbers as its coefficients. The counting sequences of combinatorial classes are the main subject of study of enumerative combinatorics. Two combinatorial classes are said to be isomorphic if they have the same numbers of objects of each size, or equivalently, if their counting sequences are the same.. Frequently, once two combinatorial classes are known to be isomorphic, a bijective proof of this equivalence is sought; such a proof may be interpreted as showing that the objects in the two isomorphic classes are cryptomorphic to each other. For instance, the triangulations of regular polygons (with size given by the number of sides of the polygon, and a fixed choice of polygon to triangulate for each size) and the set of unrooted binary plane trees (up to graph isomorphism, with a fixed ordering of the leaves, and with size given by the number of leaves) are both counted by the Catalan numbers, so they form isomorphic combinatorial classes. A bijective isomorphism in this case is given by planar graph duality: a triangulation can be transformed bijectively into a tree with a leaf for each polygon edge, an internal node for each triangle, and an edge for each two polygon edges or triangles that are adjacent to each other.. Analytic combinatorics The theory of combinatorial species and its extension to analytic combinatorics provide a language for describing many important combinatorial classes, constructing new classes from combinations of previously defined ones, and automatically deriving their counting sequences. For example, two combinatorial classes may be combined by disjoint union, or by a Cartesian product construction in which the objects are ordered pairs of one object from each of two classes, and the size function is the sum of the sizes of each object in the pair. These operations respectively form the addition and multiplication operations of a semiring on the family of (isomorphism equivalence classes of) combinatorial classes, in which the zero object is the empty combinatorial class, and the unit is the class whose only object is the empty set.. Permutation patterns In the study of permutation patterns, a combinatorial class of permutation classes, enumerated by permutation length, is called a Wilf class. The study of enumerations of specific permutation classes has turned up unexpected equivalences in counting sequences of seemingly unrelated permutation classes.

Classical and traditional music of Cura√ßao  The tumba is the most internationally renowned kind of Cura√ßao music. Tumba is the name of an African-derived rhythm, as are se√∫ and tamb√∫. The Cura√ßao-born composer Jan Gerard Palm (1831‚Äì1906) was the first composer to write music for the lyrics of tumba's. There are traditional lyrics associated with different tumba songs, but they are sometimes scandalous and accusatory, and are thus not always sung. Tumba was known as early as the 19th century, and it is now a popular part of the Carnival Road March.Ledesma and Scaramuzzo, p. 301. Besides tumbas, there is a very rich tradition of Antillean waltzes, mazurkas, danzas and pasillos that are popular in Cura√ßao, Bonaire and Aruba. This music is often referred to as the Classical Music from Cura√ßao and Aruba. Well known composers of the Netherlands Antilles are Jan Gerard Palm (1831‚Äì1906), Chris Ulder (1843‚Äì1895), Joseph Sickman Corsen (1853‚Äì1911), Paul de Lima (1861‚Äì1926), Jacobo Conrad (1879‚Äì1918), Rudolph Palm (1880‚Äì1950), Charles Maduro (1883‚Äì1947), John Palm (1885‚Äì1925), Toni Palm (1885‚Äì1963), Jacobo Palm (1887‚Äì1982) Albert Palm (1903‚Äì1958), Edgar Palm (1905‚Äì1998), Wim Statius Muller (1930), Robert Rojer (1939) and Randal Corsen (b. 1972). Aruba is well known by its composers Rufo Wever (1917‚Äì1977) and Padu Lampe (b. 1925). Traditional work songs were very diverse on Cura√ßao, where they were sung in seshi (semi-Papiamento) or Guene. Lyrics were apentatonic. Tumba is the name of an African-derived rhythm, as are se√∫ and tamb√∫. Traditionally, Afro- Cura√ßaoan rhythms were often played in the muzik di zumbi style, which included instruments such as the benta (bow harp), gogorobi (rattlers) and flute, which created an ethereal sound. Tamb√∫ (sometimes called the Cura√ßao blues) was first sung by slaves (mostly women) expressing pain and sadness, usually accompanied by the tamb√∫ drum and the agan (a piece of iron or ploughshare) or chapi (a hoe), along with clapping (usually only by the women in the audience). Previously, drums were outlawed for slaves, and the bast√®l, a large calabash in a water barrel, was used instead. It is accompanied by an erotic dance that involves no physical touching. The dance was so racy that the government and the Roman Catholic Church sought to end the practice.Curacao Culture The se√∫ was performed during the harvest festival during traditional times, but is now continued during annual parades in the city of Willemstad. Formerly the se√∫ was a march through the fields, during which the workers brought the crops to the warehouses, the men playing drums, kachu and chapi, while the women carried produce on their heads. It was accompanied by a dance called wapa, which gracefully re-enacted the movements associated with planting and harvesting, often including work songs in Guene, the old slave language. As traditional agriculture began dying out with modern industrialization, the se√∫ too began to fade away. The Cura√ßao Department of Culture now organizes an annual parade in Willemstad on Easter Monday, which sees as many as 2500 people or more participate.  Modern music on Cura√ßao  The indigenous Papiamento (Papiamento Song) record industry emerged after the 1950s. Three men were instrumental in this renaissance: Jules de Palm, Rene de Rooy and Pierre Lauffer. They published under the pseudonym Julio Perennal, including a cancionero and a manifesto that called for more Papiamento songs to be written. Many did so, recording throughout the '50s in a mixture of styles, including Cuban and Dominican genres including son montuno, bolero, pambiche, merengue and guaracha. Nowadays the Tumba is especially popular particularly in the Carnival period. Also Ritmo Kombina (literally meaning \\"combined rhythm\\") is a combination of different types of music. It is very popular among the young crowd in Cura√ßao and is played throughout the year.

One affiliate organization is the Southern Association of Community, Junior, and Technical Colleges. Commission on Colleges The first SACS was founded in 1895 and is currently made up of Council on Accreditation and School Improvement and the Commission on Colleges which existed since 1912. It also works with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and the Association of Specialized and Professional Accreditors. The SACS Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) accredits universities and colleges in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Latin America (Extraterritorial). Every six months, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges publishes an online report on its accreditation actions, including reaffirmations of accreditation and public sanctions of institutions of higher learning. The reports include specific public sanctions of schools and statements disclosing why those institutions have been placed on sanction. The Commission on Colleges accredits both public and private institutions of higher education in the United States, including some community colleges as well as four-year institutions. As a regional accreditor, SACSCOC accreditation extends to all of the educational programs offered at the accredited institution. Institutions in Latin America accredited by SACSCOC include the Mexican universities of Fundaci√≥n Universidad de las Am√©ricas, Puebla; Universidad de las Americas, A.C.; Universidad de Monterrey; Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey; Instituto Centroamericano de Administraci√≥n de Empresas (INCAE or the Central American Institute of Business Administration) in Costa Rica and Nicaragua; and Keiser University Latin American Campus in Nicaragua. The SACSCOC has also accredited the American University in Dubai. Council on Accreditation and School Improvement SACS CASI accredits over 13,000 primary, middle, and secondary schools, as well as school systems located in the SACS region. In 2006, AdvancED was established with the unification of SACS CASI, NCA CASI, and NSSE creating the world's largest education community. Today, SACS CASI acts as an accreditation division of AdvancED. On December 9, 2018, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools had excluded Bennett College from its membership due to failure of completion of the chapter 13, section 1 of the Principles of Accreditation. During the same year, they have suspended membership of the Loyola University New Orleans for the same reason and set up special committees to Johnson University and Prairie View A&M; University for the full year. Due to this process, Memphis Theological Seminary was denied reaffirmation and was put on warning for a year, citing the lack of financial responsibilities and institutional planning. The SACS had also put full year and half year warnings on the Denmark Technical and Roanoke‚ÄìChowan Community Colleges, citing lack of governing board characteristics, as well as financial federal and state responsibilities and conflict of interest, among others. The SACS also had denied faculty change to Ferrum College and a change from private to public to the Florida National University.

The massive eruptive event that formed the traps is one of the largest known volcanic events in the last years. The eruptions continued for roughly two million years and spanned the Permian‚ÄìTriassic boundary, or P‚ÄìT boundary, which occurred between .\\"New Studies of Permian Extinction Shed Light On the Great Dying\\", New York Times, April 30, 2012. Retrieved on May 2, 2012. Large volumes of basaltic lava covered a large expanse of Siberia in a flood basalt event. Today, the area is covered by about of basaltic rock, with a volume of around . Etymology The term \\"trap\\" has been used in geology since 1785‚Äì1795 for such rock formations. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs (\\"trappa\\") and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.Trap at dictionary.reference.com Formation The source of the Siberian Traps basaltic rock has been attributed to a mantle plume, which rose until it impacted against the bottom of the Earth's crust, producing volcanic eruptions through the Siberian Craton. It has been suggested that, as the Earth's lithospheric plates moved over the mantle plume (the Iceland plume), the plume produced the Siberian Traps in the Permian and Triassic periods, later going on to produce volcanic activity on the floor of the Arctic Ocean in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and then generating volcanic activity in Iceland. Other plate tectonic causes have also been suggested. Another possible cause may be the impact that formed the Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica, which is estimated to have occurred around the same time and been nearly antipodal to the traps. The main source of rock in this formation is basalt, but both mafic and felsic rocks are present, so this formation is officially called a Flood Basalt Province. The inclusion of mafic and felsic rock indicates multiple other eruptions that occurred and coincided with the one-million-year-long eruption that created the majority of the basaltic layers. The traps are divided into sections based on their chemical, stratigraphical, and petrographical composition. One of the World Heritage Sites, the Putorana Plateau, is composed of Siberian Traps. Impact on prehistoric life One of the major questions is whether the Siberian Traps were directly responsible for the Permian‚ÄìTriassic mass extinction event that occurred 250 million years ago, or if they were themselves caused by some other, larger event, such as an asteroid impact. A recent hypothesis put forward is that the volcanism triggered the growth of Methanosarcina, a microbe that then spewed enormous amounts of methane into Earth's atmosphere, ultimately altering the Earth's carbon cycle based on observations such as a significant increase of inorganic carbon reservoirs in marine environments. This extinction event, also colloquially called the Great Dying, affected all life on Earth, and is estimated to have killed about 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species living at the time. Some of the disastrous events that impacted the Earth continued to repeat themselves on Earth five to six million years after the initial extinction occurred. Over time a small portion of the life that survived the extinction was able to repopulate and expand starting with low trophic levels (local communities) until the higher trophic levels (large habitats) were able to be re-established. Calculations of sea water temperature from Œ¥18O measurements indicate that at the peak of the extinction, the Earth underwent lethally hot global warming, in which equatorial ocean temperatures exceeded . It took roughly eight to nine million years for any diverse ecosystem to be re-established; however, new classes of animals were established after the extinction that did not exist beforehand. Palaeontological evidence further indicates that the global distribution of tetrapods vanished, with very rare exceptions in the region of Pangaea that is today Utah, between latitudes bounded by approximately 40¬∞S to 30¬∞N. The tetrapod gap of equatorial Pangaea coincides with an end-Permian to Middle Triassic global \\"coal gap\\" that indicates the loss of peat swamps. Peat formation, a product of high plant productivity, was reestablished only in the Anisian stage of the Triassic, and even then only in high southern latitudes, although gymnosperm forests appeared earlier (in the Early Spathian), but again only in northern and southern higher latitudes.\\"Could Siberian volcanism have caused the Earth's largest extinction event?\\", Eurekalert!, 9 January 2012. Retrieved on 12 January 2012. In equatorial Pangaea, the establishment of conifer-dominated forests was not until the end of the Spathian, and the first coals at these latitudes did not appear until the Carnian, around 15 million years after their end-Permian disappearance. These signals suggest equatorial temperatures exceeded their thermal tolerance for many marine vertebrates at least during two thermal maxima, whereas terrestrial equatorial temperatures were sufficiently severe to suppress plant and animal abundance during most of the Early Triassic. Dating The volcanism that occurred in the Siberian Traps resulted in copious amounts of magma being ejected from the Earth's crust‚Äîleaving permanent traces of rock from the same time period of the mass extinction that is able to be examined today. More specifically, zircon is found in some of the volcanic rocks. To further the accuracy of the age of the zircon, several varying aged pieces of zircon were organized into a timeline based on when they crystallized. The CA-TIMS technique, a chemical abrasion age-dating technique that eliminates variability in accuracy due to lead depletion in zircon over time, was then used to accurately determine the age of the zircons found in the Siberian Traps. Eliminating the variability due to lead, the CA-TIMS age-dating technique allowed uranium within the zircon to be the centre focus in linking the volcanism in the Siberian Traps that resulted in high amounts of magmatic material with the Permian‚ÄìTriassic mass extinction. To further the connection between the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, other disastrous events occurred around the same time period, such as sea level changes, meteor impacts and volcanism. Specifically focusing on volcanism, rock samples from the Siberian Traps and other southern regions were obtained and compared. Basalts and gabbro samples from several southern regions close to and from the Siberian Traps were dated based on argon isotope 40 and argon isotope 39 age-dating methods. Feldspar and biotite was specifically used to focus on the samples age and duration of the presence magma from the volcanic event in the Siberian Traps. The majority of the basalt and gabbro samples dated to 250 million years ago, covered a surface area of five million square kilometres on the Siberian Traps and occurred within a short period of time with rapid rock solidification/cooling. Studies confirmed that samples of gabbro and basalt from the same time period of the Permian‚ÄìTriassic event from the other southern regions also matched the age of samples within the Siberian Traps. This confirms the assumption of the linkage between the age of volcanic rocks within the Siberian Traps, along with rock samples from other southern regions to the Permian‚ÄìTriassic mass extinction event. Mineral deposits native iron The giant Norilsk-Talnakh nickel‚Äìcopper‚Äìpalladium deposit formed within the magma conduits in the most complete part of the Siberian Traps. It has been linked to the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, which occurred approximately 251.4 million years ago, based on large amounts of nickel and other elements found in rock beds that were laid down after the extinction occurred. The method used to correlate the extinction event with the surplus amount of nickel located in the Siberian Traps, is by comparing the timeline of the magmatism within the traps and the timeline of the extinction itself. Before the linkage between magmatism and the extinction event was discovered, it was hypothesized that the mass extinction and volcanism occurred at the same time due to the linkages in rock composition.

Its musical output includes pop singer Heather Nova, and her brother Mishka. Collie Buddz has also gained international success with reggae hits in the US and the UK. The island's musical traditions also include steelpan, calypso, choral music, as well as an array of bagpipe music played by descendants of Irish and Scottish settlers; the biggest bagpipe band on modern Bermuda is the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band. Bermuda is also the home of one of the most popular Caribbean music groups in the United States, the Bermuda Strollers.Bermuda Online The islands are also home to gombey dancers, reggae, gospel music, drum majorette bands, jazz and other styles.  Folk music  Bermuda is home to several folk traditions, including pipe bands, the gombey dance and a ballad song. = Gombey = The Gombey dance is an iconic symbol of Bermudan culture. It mixes elements of British, West African and indigenous New World cultures. Traditionally in Gombey, dancers are black and male (though in modern times, female groups have emerged) and their father has to have been a Gombey dancer. They perform in groups of 10-30Roots of an African American Christmas in wild masquerade costumes with brilliant colors and odd angles, meant to evoke the plumage of tropical birds; they are sometimes based on Bible verses. Gombey dances are taught orally, through family members. The dances are energetic, and grow swifter gradually, while the spectators become more wild and energetic. The gombey tradition is at its liveliest during the Christmas season, and is also performed during Boxing Day, Easter, New Year's Day, football and cricket matches and other festivals and celebrations.Frommers The word \\"Gombey\\" is related to the Bahamian \\"Goombay\\", a similar dance tradition. It also refers to a specific drum of African origin (see List of Caribbean drums). In addition to the Bahamian Goombay tradition, Gombey is similar to some other Afro-Caribbean styles and celebrations (such as the Mummers). Afro- Caribbeans brought to Bermuda as slaves or convicts during colonial times introduced other Caribbean traditions. -Read full Wiki on Gombey. = Ballad = Bermuda's ballad tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, though it remains popular among a devoted subculture on the island. The Bermudan ballad is characterized by \\"wry, self-deprecating humor\\", often improvised, and concerned with the rapid change of Bermudan culture. The most famous Bermudan balladeer is Hubert Smith, a popular local composer who performed for many visiting royalty and foreign heads of state. He is also the composer of \\"Bermuda Is Another World\\", an unofficial anthem for the island. = Bagpipe music = Bermuda has a strong Scottish and Irish cultural presence, and is home to well-known bagpipe bands that draw on those traditions, especially the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band. The bagpipe tradition was brought to Bermuda by Scottish and Irish soldiers from the 18th to the 20th centuries. There were, until relatively recently, two major bagpipe bands in Bermuda, the Bermuda Cadets Pipe Band and the Bermuda Police Pipe Band. Both bands formed in 1955 and disbanded in 1992, the same year the Bermuda Islands Pipe Band was formed. Other historically important bagpipe bands include the Salvation Army Young People's Band, which dates back to the 1930s.  Choirs  Religious choir singing is also popular on Bermuda. Well-known choirs include the Roman Catholic Diocesan Choir, the Mt. Zion Male Voice Choir, as well as the non-church choirs Philharmonic Choir and Post Office Choir.  Calypso  Calypso first became a part of Bermuda music in the 1940s and 50s. It was imported from Trinidad and Tobago. The Talbot Brothers were the island's first major calypsonians; they organized as a group in 1942, and began touring the United States by the early 1950s. Norman Luboff followed in the footsteps of Jamaican-American calypso singer Harry Belafonte in popularizing Trinidadian calypso. Luboff de-emphasized the saucy, ribald side of calypso and created a popular form that appealed to the masses. His signature song is \\"Yellow Bird\\" which became very popular in the 1960s. Genuine Bermudian calypso can only be found on the fine Bermuda Gombey & Calypso 1953-1960.See the Bermuda Gombey & Calypso 1953-1960 A detailed history of Bermuda calypso and gombey written by Bruno Blum can be read in the CD booklet (available online in both French and English).Read the Bermuda Gombey & Calypso 1953-1960 CD booklet (online in both French and English): Artists include Sidney Bean, The Talbot Brothers, Reuben McCoy, Hubert Smith, The Four Deuces, Al Harris, Erskine Zuill and jazzman Lance Hayward, the first musician ever produced by Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records.  Steelpan  Steelpan music was invented in the late 1930s Trinidad, and was brought to Bermuda by a number of groups, including the Esso Steel Band, who moved to Bermuda in the 1950s. Esso became known for arranging Western classical music for the steelpan. In the 1960s, local choral traditions were merged with calypso and steelpan to create a distinctively Bermudian style. Paul A.W. Smith and De Onion Patch Crew are a new steelpan group who perform newer hits like soca and R&B; music on steelpan.http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140123/ISLAND/140129902  Music institutions  Bermuda is home to the Bermuda Ballet Association, which was founded by Patricia Gray in 1962, with support from Ana Roje. Other music institutions include the Bermuda National Youth Jazz Ensemble and the Bermuda Philharmonic Orchestra. There is also a Bermuda Folk Club. There is a Portuguese Cultural Association which promotes the culture of the large Portuguese population on Bermuda, especially tradition folk dances of the Azores. The Bermuda Philharmonic conductor is Gary Burgess, a former opera singer. Bermuda has also produced notable classical musicians in Marcelle Clamens, an opera singer, mezzo-soprano Jane Farge, pianists Peter Carpenter and Karol Sue Reddington, and Joyce Mary Helen DeShield.

For his 21st birthday, he threw a \\"lavish\\" party at Luggala, the Gothic family seat in the Wicklow Mountains, where \\"two private jets flew the 200 or so guests to Ireland, including John Paul Getty, Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Jones' then girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, and Paul McCartney.\\" His life is captured by Paul Howard in the biography I Read the News Today, Oh Boy published in 2016. Death On 17 December 1966, Browne was driving with his girlfriend, model Suki Potier, in his Lotus Elan through South Kensington at high speed (some reports suggesting in excess of 106 mph/170 km/h). He was under the influence of alcohol and other drugs at the time. Browne failed to see a traffic light and proceeded through the junction of Redcliffe Square and Redcliffe Gardens, colliding with a parked lorry. He died of his injuries the following day. Potier claimed that Browne swerved the car to absorb the impact of the crash to save her life. Following his death, his estranged wife Nicky launched a public legal battle for custody of their two young children; Browne's mother, Lady Oranmore and Browne, also sought custody. A judge eventually ruled that the boys should live with their grandmother.

Due to the tight confinement of charge carriers in quantum dots, they exhibit an electronic structure similar to atoms. Lasers fabricated from such an active media exhibit device performance that is closer to gas lasers, and avoid some of the negative aspects of device performance associated with traditional semiconductor lasers based on bulk or quantum well active media. Improvements in modulation bandwidth, lasing threshold, relative intensity noise, linewidth enhancement factor and temperature insensitivity have all been observed. The quantum dot active region may also be engineered to operate at different wavelengths by varying dot size and composition. This allows quantum dot lasers to be fabricated to operate at wavelengths previously not possible using semiconductor laser technology. Recently, devices based on quantum dot active media are finding commercial application in medicine (laser scalpel, optical coherence tomography), display technologies (projection, laser TV), spectroscopy and telecommunications. A 10 Gbit/s quantum dot laser that is insensitive to temperature fluctuation for use in optical data communications and optical networks has been developed using this technology. The laser is capable of high-speed operation at 1.3 Œºm wavelengths, at temperatures from 20 ¬∞C to 70 ¬∞C. It works in optical data transmission systems, optical LANs and metro-access systems.

The third named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1970 Atlantic hurricane season, Celia developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on July 31\\\\. Initially, the depression tracked north-northwestward without significantly strengthening, and crossed over western Cuba on August 1\\\\. Heavy rains on the island caused severe flooding, leading to five fatalities. The depression entered the Gulf of Mexico and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Celia later on August 1\\\\. Due to warm sea surface temperatures, Celia rapidly intensified into a major hurricane on August 1 and after the creation of the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale in 1971 she was estimated to have been a Category 3 storm. Storm surge and swells lashed the west coast of Florida, especially the Panhandle, causing eight people to drown. Early on August 2, Celia began to weaken. However, the storm underwent rapid deepening again and peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on August 3\\\\. In Louisiana, tides caused minor coastal flooding. Minor erosion damage was reported along Highway 82 in Cameron Parish. Late on August 3, Celia made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Impact was the worst in Nueces County, which observed gusts as high as . In Corpus Christi, about one-third of houses suffered severe damage or were destroyed. Additionally, about 90% of the buildings in downtown were damaged to some degree. Celia weakened as it continued further inland and dissipated over New Mexico on August 6\\\\. The remnants of Celia brought up to of rainfall to the state. Overall, this storm caused 28 deaths and $930 million (1970 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa in late July; a weather station in Dakar, Senegal observed a wind shift on July 23\\\\. The system moved quickly across the Atlantic at and reached the Lesser Antilles by July 28. The wave then continued moving rapidly westward across the Caribbean Sea. However, falling atmospheric pressures over the Southern United States eroded a subtropical ridge, causing the system to decelerate by July 30\\\\. Around that time, a closed circulation began to organize in the northwestern Caribbean between the Cayman Islands and Swan Island. At 0000 UTC on July 31, a tropical depression developed about 90 mi (145 km) west-southwest of Grand Cayman. The depression strengthened while heading north-northwestward, though a reconnaissance aircraft could not complete its mission on July 31 due to the depression's proximity to Cuba. Early on August 1, the depression made landfall in western Pinar del R√≠o Province, Cuba. A weather station in Cape San Antonio recorded a minimum barometric pressure of . After reaching the southeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 1, warm sea surface temperatures caused the depression to undergo rapid deepening. Later that day, the depression reached tropical storm intensity and was named \\"Celia\\", based on a reconnaissance flight observing tropical storm force winds. Satellite imagery indicated that Celia was becoming significantly more organized. At 0000 UTC on August 2, reconnaissance aircraft data indicated that Celia suddenly strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, the storm weakened to a Category 2 hurricane about six hours later. Due to Celia's steady west- northwestward motion across the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center marked that the storm \\"aimed at the Corpus Christi area like a wild beast stalking its prey.\\" Early on August 3, it weakened further to a Category 1 hurricane. Unexpectedly, Celia underwent rapid deepening once again while nearing the coast of Texas later on August 3, including a decrease in pressure in only 15 hours. At 1800 UTC on August 3, Celia attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas at the same intensity. Celia \\"maintained strength for an unusually long time\\" after moving inland, weakening to a tropical storm at 0600 UTC on August 4\\\\. Early on the following day, the storm further weakened to a tropical depression. Celia dissipated over western Texas at 1800 UTC on August 5, though the remnants persisted until reaching New Mexico. Preparations In the Gulf of Mexico, oil rig crew workers began leaving and headed for land. Residents of Texas coastal towns of High Island, Port Bolivar, and Gilchrist were evacuated further inland. The National Hurricane Center also issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the coast of Texas in anticipation of the storm. At 1600 UTC on August 2, a hurricane warning was posted from Palacios to Port Arthur. About six hours later, the warning was extended southward to Rockport. The hurricane warning was expanded further southward to Corpus Christi at 1000 UTC on August 3. Impact Celia caused 27 fatalities, four in Cuba, eight in Florida and 15 in Texas and left $930 million in damages. Corpus Christi, Texas suffered the worst impact, with at least 85% of all the structures in the city damaged, with 90% of downtown buildings were damaged or destroyed. Additionally, about one-third of houses were severely damaged or flattened. =Cuba and Florida= As a tropical depression, Celia dropped heavy rains over western Cuba, resulting in major flooding. Four people drowned and another man was electrocuted in the water when he tried to retrieve a downed power line. While over the central Gulf of Mexico, strong rip currents and large swells affected Florida, measuring up to in the Panhandle. In Escambia County alone, at least 12 lifeguard rescues occurred. Pensacola Beach was closed to the public on September 3, after several rescues on the previous day. Eight people drowned due to adverse water conditions in the Florida Panhandle. =Texas= Aransas Pass The most severe damage was in Corpus Christi and Aransas Pass. Throughout the state, 8,950 homes were destroyed and it damaged about 55,650 others. About 252 small businesses, 331 boats, and 310 farm buildings were either damaged or destroyed. Initially, losses were estimated to have reached $434 million. However, due to lower insurance rate of coverage, the original insured losses, $310 million, were tripled, rather than doubled. Thus, the damage toll was revised upward to $930 million in 2011. Damage to crops was slightly more than $8.8 million. In addition, Celia caused 15 fatalities and injured 466 others. The most severe damage occurred in the streaks of damage, not by tornadoes, but a series microbursts and downbursts, most of which occurred in a 15-minute span. Survivors of the storm described the downbursts as \\"rocket shells\\" exploding. However, areas between the streaks suffered surprisingly little damage, mainly ornamental due to debris from the homes nearby. Celia dropped heavy rains as it made landfall. However, due to the small size and fast movement of the storm, precipitation was not widespread. At the time of landfall, much of Texas was suffering from a drought. Most areas received . In Alvin, a small tornado caused the destruction of a few fences and moved a pickup truck. Downed trees caused slight property damage in Amistad Dam, a municipality in Val Verde County. Gusts between were reported within the Aransas County portion of Aransas Pass. In Artesia Wells, minimal damage occurred to property, reaching only $5,000. The storm damage some homes and 15% of crops in Austwell. Losses in that section of the city reached an estimated $20 million. Minor damage was inflicted on weak structures and shingle or metal roofs in Crystal City. Impact on trees and crops were minimal. Thus, the reported wind speeds of were considered \\"doubtful\\". Property damage in Del Rio was about $1 million, with wind impacts mostly to roofs, mobile homes, signs, boats, windows, trees, and homes under construction, while some businesses and homes were flooded. In Frio County, a tornado spawned in the Dilley area toppled utility poles, destroyed several chicken houses, and blew the roof of a house away. In addition, two farm houses were deroofed and several outhouses were damaged. Another tornado spawned nearby caused \\"considerable\\" damage to the Dilley Civic Center, destroyed machine sheds, unroofed outbuildings, and felled many electrical poles. Throughout Dilley, there was $250,000 in property damage and $350,000 in crop losses. An estimated $50,000 was inflected to property in Eagle Pass. Strong winds in George West caused damage to 90% of trees, some houses, and cotton crops. Damage estimates in the city range from $250,000‚Äì$500,000. In Gregory, property losses was about $1 million, while there was about $25,000 in damage to crops. Near Lake Corpus Christi, a man died after he was struck by debris from his house, which was hit by a tornado. Two other people were injured by that tornado and several homes were destroyed. The storm spawned at least 2 other tornadoes, those neither caused any known damage. Damage in Langtry was very minor, reaching only $600. A tornado in Port O'Connor, destroyed a boat storage shed, which was owned by Cooperative Weather Observed Bill H. Young. In Refugio, a rancher observed wind gusts up to . About $707,500 in damage occurred to property, while crop losses reached $425,000. One injury was reported after a person was struck by flying glass. Wind gusts up to in Sandia damaged every house, 90% of cotton crops, and caused 1 fatality. Although wind gusts of were observed in Taft, only $5 million in property and $500,000 in crop damages were reported. In Tilden, the storm brought maximum sustained winds up to . As a result, the entire city lost telephone and electrical services and there was \\"lots of damage\\" to trees, 80% of houses, and roofs. Property damage reached about $3.4 million, while there was also $25,000 in crop losses. Property losses in Uvalde reached $100,000, while damage to crops was estimated at $250,000. Additionally, a tornado was spawned in Yoakum, though it apparently caused negligible impact. Nueces County Damaged building in Corpus Christi The highest tides produced by the storm lashed Nueces County. Tides were and mean sea level at Port Aransas Beach and the Port Aransas Jetty, respectively. The heaviest rainfall totals observed from the storm also fell in Nueces County, with of precipitation reported in Robstown. Because rainfall was relatively light, minor, if any flood damage occurred. Strong winds were reported, with winds gusts measuring as high as and at the Corpus Christi Weather Bureau Office and Aransas Pass, respectively. Further inland, wind gusts were estimated to have reached at Robstown High School, as the oil derricks on the property, built to withstand winds of , were knocked down. Due to high winds, 85% of the total property damage caused by the storm occurred in Corpus Christi, with 90% of the buildings in downtown either damaged or destroyed. About a third of the houses in the city had serious damage or were destroyed. The University of Corpus Christi, a private institution located on Ward Island, suffered so much damage that it could not afford to rebuild, and it was sold to the State in 1973. Just northeast of the Corpus Christi International Airport, several hundred mobile homes were ripped into small fragments, and the remains were scattered for hundreds of yards. Facilities owned by the Southwestern Bell Corporation (which later became AT&T;) suffered $10 million in losses. Another telephone company in the area, General Telephone Company, estimated $700,000 in damage occurred to its business. At the United States Army helicopter repair center in Corpus Christi, there were about $5 million in damage. Around 800‚Äì900 family housing units at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi were considered uninhabitable, indicating $35 million in losses at that location. Two large Sunoco oil tanks and another owned by Humble Oil burned after possibly being struck by lightning. Approximately $17 million in losses occurred to both companies. Heavy property damage was also reported in rural areas, totaling slightly more than $20 million. At least 75% of the buildings in Port Aransas were damaged. Overall, 74% of property losses associated with Celia were in Nueces County. =Elsewhere= While crossing the Gulf of Mexico, Celia produced tides above normal on the southwestern coast of Louisiana. As a result, slight erosion of Louisiana Highway 82 occurred in Cameron Parish between Johnson Bayou and Holly Beach. No damage or fatalities were reported in that state. After dissipating, the remnants of Celia produced up to of rain in New Mexico, though no other impacts in the state are known. Aftermath Following the storm, then-President of the United States Richard Nixon declared seven counties in Texas as disaster areas ‚Äì Aransas, Bee, Jim Wells, Live Oak, Nueces, Refugio, and San Patricio ‚Äì allowing affected residents to be eligible for federal relief. Immediately, then-Governor of Texas Preston Smith sent National Guardsmen to the area to patrol and assist with recovery. About a week after the storm, Governor Smith stated that the most urgent need was financial assistance, and designated the American Red Cross as the official relief agency. The American Red Cross chapters in Colbert and Lauderdale counties in Alabama announced that they were accepting donations to send to southern Texas. In Corpus Christi, officials applied to pollution control officers for permission to burn of debris. The University of Corpus Christi (UCC) suffered so much damage that repairs were not affordable. In May 1971, the Texas Legislature passed a bill to establish a Texas A&I; campus in Corpus Christi. Two years later, after local residents raised approximately $1.8 million to support the school, the UCC transferred its properties to Texas A&I; University (now known as Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi). In addition, most homeowners insurance policies refused to write insurance for areas considered to be \\"high risk\\" along the Texas coast, prompting the state government to form the Texas Catastrophe Property Insurance Association, now known as the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. Today, TWIA offers coverage to the 14 coastal counties of Texas and a small portion of Harris County near Houston, Texas. =Retirement= Due to the severity of damage caused by the hurricane, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Celia the following year. The name was then replaced by Carmen which was retired upon its first use in 1974. However, the name Celia is still used for Eastern Pacific name lists and was most recently used in 2016.

Its president is Barbara Paron. History The province of Ferrara is believed to have been first settled in by the Romans at the site \\"Forum Alieni\\", although remains of the coastal port of Spina have been unearthed near Comacchio by archaeologists. Ferrara was first mentioned when it was conquered by Germanic tribe the Lombards in 753 CE, and the Byzantine Empire lost its rule over the city. It was gifted to the Holy See by the Franks in either 754 or 756 CE, and was led by the Bishops of Ravenna. Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries started reclaiming Podeltan lands in the 9th century. In 1055, the partially independent town of Fererra was given imperial powers, but was led by Matilda of Tuscany from 1101 and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor from 1158. Members of the House of Este took control of the city during the 13th century, and formed a university in Ferrara in 1391. Walls were built around the perimeter of Ferrara in the 15th and 16th centuries. It joined the Papal States in 1598. Its citadel was occupied by the Austrians in 1831 after the Italian United Provinces was formed, and the Austrians occupied the city in 1847. On 21 June 1859 the Austrians left the city of Ferrara and it was able to join the Kingdom of Italy. In 1921, Italo Balbo joined the newly created National Fascist Party and soon became a secretary of the Ferrara fascist organization. He began to organize Fascist gangs and formed his own group. They broke strikes for local landowners and attacked communists and socialists in the region. His success in Ferrara set in motion the rapid rise of Fascism in northern Italy and played an important role in the transformation of Fascism into a major political movement. Geography The province of Ferarra is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. It is the most northerly province in the region to abut onto the Adriatic Sea. The Province of Rovigo in the Veneto region lies immediately to the north and the Province of Mantua in Lombardy to the northwest.

The province of Forl√¨-Cesena () is a province in the Emilia‚ÄìRomagna region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Forl√¨. The province has a population of 394,273 as of 2016 over an area of . It contains 30 comuni and the provincial president is Davide Drei. Although located close to the independent Republic of San Marino, Forl√¨-Cesena does not share a land border with the sovereign state. History Forl√¨ was founded by the Roman consul Marcus Livius Salinator, and it was connected to the Via Aemilia in 188 BCE. By the 12th century CE, it had become a Ghibelline commune and military garrison. The Holy See initiated a small attempt to rule Forl√¨ in 1278, but the family of Ordelaffi led the city from 1315 until 1480. The city was later governed by Girolamo Riario and his wife, Caterina Sforza; during this period, the Holy See attempted to regain control but was unsuccessful. Spanish Pope Alexander VI ordered his son Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois, to Forl√¨ and other communes in the region; Borgia successfully gained control of Forl√¨ in 1500, but lost it in 1503, after the death of Alexander VI. Until the formation of the Kingdom of Italy, it remained under the rule of the Holy See. Cesena was first owned by the Romans until the fall of Rome, when it was taken by the Byzantine Empire. Following this, it was owned by archbishops of Ravenna. During the period of issues between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Holy See took over Cesena from the Ordelaffis. Antipope Clement VII's troops almost completely destroyed Cesena in 1377, and the Pope gave the city to the House of Malatesta. After the House of Malatesta controlled the city from 1378 to 1465, the Holy See regained control of Cesena. Leonardo da Vinci designed the port Cesenatico. It remained under papal rule until Italy was unified. In 1921, there was a rapid advance of the Fascist movement in the region triggered by issues connected with agrarian reform. Buildings belonging to the republicans and socialists were seized or burnt down by Italo Balbo, and on July 29, he and his men moved throughout the provinces of Ravenna and Forl√¨, burning every socialist organisation headquarters in a night of terror which was later called the \\"column of fire\\". This was a pivotal moment in the advance of Fascism in northern Italy. Geography The province of Forl√¨- Cesena is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. Along with that of Rimini, it is the most southerly of the provinces in the region and it abuts onto the Adriatic Sea for a short distance.

The river was chronologically the last of several imagined incarnations of an imagined Great River of the West which would be for North America west of the Rockies what the Mississippi River was east of the Rockies. The hopes were to find a waterway from coast to coast, sparing the traveling around Cape Horn at the tip of South America.Miles Harvey, The Island of Lost Maps: A True Story of Cartographic Crime, p. 208-215\\\\. New York : Random House, 2000. (, ) Dominguez, V√©lez de Escalante and Miera In 1776, two Franciscan missionaries Atanasio Dom√≠nguez and Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante sought to find a land route between Santa Fe in Nuevo M√©xico to Monterey in Alta California. They were part of what has become known as the Dominguez‚ÄìEscalante Expedition, a ten-man expedition including Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco (Miera) acting as the cartographer. On September 13, they encountered what is now called the Green River, a southward-flowing tributary of the Colorado and named it San Buenaventura after the catholic saint Bonaventure. Map by Barnardo de Miera, 1778, depicting the Buenaventura River as a faulty combination of Green River and Sevier River. The depiction of \\"Lake Timpanogos\\" with a narrow strait in the middle is probably a misunderstanding of the indigenes' description of the large lake to the north (the Great Salt Lake) as directly connected to Utah Lake rather than connected by the 50 mile long Jordan River. \\"Laguna de Miera\\" is the Sevier Lake, again drawn from descriptions by the indigenes. At that point in time, there was nothing mythical about the Buenaventura River. Dominguez and V√©lez de Escalante's journal correctly notes that above their crossing, the river flowed toward the west. It flowed generally southwest where they crossed it and continued southwest as they traveled in its vicinity. Escalante also correctly recorded that after its junction with the Rio San Clemente (today's White River? ‚Äì which he also named) the Buenaventura River turned to the south.Escalante Journal, September 17 So, the original Buenaventura River is real and exists today under a different name. Sevier and Beaver Rivers, showing the Sevier's correct placement relative to the Green River. The lake to the north, just west of the city of Provo, is Utah Lake. The south tip of the Great Salt Lake can be seen at the top of the map. After establishing contact with a branch of the Ute (Yutahs) Tribe on the south shore of what they called Lake Timpanogos (various spellings), now called \\"Utah Lake,\\" the expedition turned south-southwest. On September 29, they were surprised to come upon a river (the Sevier River) flowing from the south-southeast, and turned toward the west at the point where they encountered it. Dominguez and V√©lez de Escalante noted in their journal that the Native American name for this river suggested it was the same river they had named Buenaventura. They expressed doubts it was the same river because had it been so, it was substantially smaller downstream than it had been upstream--the opposite of the normal pattern. They named this river the Rio San Ysabel. The Native Americans told them it flowed west from there into a lake (Sevier Lake) and beyond. The Sevier Lake has no outlet, so the indigenes may have been referring to the west-flowing Humboldt River, which originates over 150 miles northwest, and were misinterpreted by the explorers. Despite Dominguez and V√©lez de Escalante's doubts that the Green and Sevier Rivers were one and the same, the maps Miera produced do not include the Rio San Ysabel and depict the Buenaventura flowing southwest from where they encountered it in northeastern Utah, to the Sevier Lake in west-central Utah. In an accompanying note to king Charles III of Spain, Miera recommended building several missions in the area and mentioned the possibility of a water way to the Pacific Ocean, via the Buenaventura or the Timpanogos River: the river Miera depicts on his map as flowing west from the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Although Miera documented a correct description of the GSL given to them by the indigenes the Spanish assumed that what they thought had been described was incorrect and interpreted their description of the \\"extremely salty\\" lake as the ocean and assumed that the description of the river flowing from \\"Lake Timpanogos\\", which is the Jordan River flowing between Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, was of a waterway to the Pacific. The error of depicting the Buenaventura as flowing southwest to a lake was perpetuated by early explorers and cartographers such as Alexander von Humboldt, who used a map from the Dominguez and Escalant√© expedition to prepare his maps in 1804 and 1809. Zebulon Pike used Humboldt's maps to prepare his map for his book from 1810. Aaron Arrowsmith in 1814 published a map depicting the Buenaventura flowing to \\"Lac Sale\\". These cartographers conservatively did not try to chart the area west of that explored by Dominguez and Escalante. Extending the Buenaventura West to the Pacific Watershed map of the San Joaquin River, depicting its head in the Sierra Nevada There had long been a hope that a river flowing west from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean would provide an easy route for travel and trade. This dream was the descendant of the long sought Northwest Passage. When Francisco Garc√©s drew his maps of Alta California, he did not understand the nature of the Sierra Nevada, and he drew the \\"San Felipe\\" or San Joaquin River originating beyond the Sierras in the Great Basin and flowing to the Pacific Ocean, in or near San Francisco Bay. Then, when Manuel Augustin Mascaro and Miguel Constanso made the first map of the whole Viceroyalty of New Spain (1784), they extended the \\"San Felipe\\" almost to the Sevier Lake.Cline, op. cit. pp. 52-3 A similar map was published in 1820 by Sidney E. Morse showing the Rio de San Buenaventura flowing into a lake, the western limits of which are unknown. This map shows the \\"Supposed river between the Buenaventura and the Bay of Francisco, which will probably be the communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific\\" toward this lake, but quite not connecting with it. A map by J. Finlayson (1822) shows a Rio de S. Buenaventura originating near the \\" source of the Rio Colorado\\" and emptying into a salt lake the western limits of which \\"are unknown\\". This same map indicates that an uncharted Rio de San Filipe crosses a range of mountains at 122 degrees west longitude. Other cartographers began to boldly assert that rivers flowed from Lake Timpanogos and \\"Lac Salado\\" to the Pacific Ocean. Henry S. Tanner's influential map of 1822 shows the Buenaventura River flowing from the north central Rockies through the Sevier Lake to the Pacific Ocean south of Monterey Bay. This map also shows two rivers flowing from Lake Timpanogos, (Utah Lake) one to San Francisco Bay (the R. Timpanogos), the other to Port Orford, Oregon (the Los Mongos R.) where the Rogue River enters the Pacific. A similar map by Anthony Finley was published in 1826 A map by Thomas Bradford (1835) shows a river flowing to San Francisco Bay (labeled as \\"Port Sir Francis Drake\\" in a region Bradford called \\"New Albion\\") from the south end of Lake Timpanogos. There is no reference to Rio de San Buenaventura. An 1844 map by James Bowden shows a landlocked Buenaventura wrapping around the southeast side of a \\"doubtful\\" Lake Timpanogos. Explorations to find the Buenaventura Section depicting the Pacific Coast with fictive Rivers from the Wasatch Range to the Pacific Ocean. The Great Salt Lake (GSL) was first seen and reported as very saline by white North Americans in 1824, apparently independently by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost.Morgan, op. cit. pp. 182-83 Upon learning of the GSL, explorers began equating Lake Timpanogos on the maps with it, and apparently unaware of the fact that saline lakes such as the Great Salt and Sevier Lakes have no outlets; began efforts to find the rivers flowing from them west to the Pacific as promised by maps such as Tanner's. In 1825, William H. Ashley attempted to float the Green (Buenaventura) River to either what was called \\"Salt Lake\\" (actually Sevier Lake) on Tanner's map, or the Colorado River, to which the fur traders suspected it flowed.Morgan, op. cit. p. 164 He started in present-day Wyoming, and after passing through the treacherous Gates of Lodore, aborted the trip prior to entering Desolation Canyon. Despite not having gotten close to the Colorado River, he concluded that the Green did empty into it, and continued his exploration by engaging Provost to lead him on an overland excursion to observe the GSL. The next spring his partner, Jedediah Smith, explored areas the north and west of the GSL, but found no rivers flowing from it. He sent more men to float around the shoreline to the west and south, and they were also unsuccessful in finding the \\"Los Mongos R.\\" and \\"R. Timpanogos\\". However, this information was delayed in reaching cartographers, and in 1836 Tanner repeated the depictions of the three rivers, except he identified the \\"R. Timpanogos\\" as \\"R. S. Sacramento ou (or) Timpanogos\\". So, when, in 1841, John Bidwell embarked over the Rocky Mountains to California, he was advised to take carpenters tools with them, to build canoes and sail from the GSL to the Pacific. from A German map from 1829, very similar to the Tanner maps, showing the Buenaventura River running from Sierra Verde (part of the Rocky Mountains) though the Sevier lake (Teguayo). The route between the Sevier Lake and the Pacific Ocean is represented as uncertain After Ashley retired from the fur trade his partnership with Smith was bought out by Smith and two new partners, Smith focused on finding the Buenaventura. In 1826, he led an expedition south from southern Idaho, and upon reaching the mouth of the Jordan River on the southeast end of the GSL, traveled south along to the east side of Utah Lake. Since he identified the Jordan River as the outlet of Utah Lake, he did not explore the lake further. He encountered the Sevier River on its northeast-flowing stretch, and assuming it continued to flow north to Utah Lake, dismissed it as the possible Buenaventura and continued southwest to Southern California.Morgan, op. cit. p. 196 In 1827 and 1828 he tracked the western flank of the Sierra Nevada in its full length, without registering a river that passed through the range, but he heard the Sacramento River referenced as the \\"Buenaventura\\" by Luis Antonio Arg√ºello. A map by Albert Gallatin (1836), based on information from Smith's travels, labels the Sacramento River as the Buenaventura and equated Lake Timpanogos with the GSL, but did not try to connect the two. In the spring of 1827, Daniel Potts, a fur trader in the employ of Smith, encountered the Sevier River downstream from the point Smith had the previous summer. He continued to follow the river downstream to the Sevier Lake, which he confirmed was a saline lake, but did not try to circumvent it to find an outlet. He instead followed the entire course of the river upstream to its head.Morgan, op. cit. pp. 226-27 The Buenaventura River's existence or non- existence was a matter of controversy until 1843, when John Charles Fr√©mont, with Thomas Fitzpatrick and Kit Carson as scouts, led a perilous expedition from the Columbia River to Sacramento, California via the Sierra Nevada. By that time the fact that the Buenaventura River did not flow from the headwaters of the Colorado/Green River was well established among the trappers and guides, but maps continued to show it and other rivers flowing from the region of Great Salt Lake to the sea. On January 27, 1844 at Walker River, he briefly believed himself to have found the mythical river, but it was the result of a faulty measurement. Two days later he discovered his mistake and definitively proved that the Buenaventura did not exist.Excerpts from Fr√©mont's journals. Accessed online 7 November 2006. Upon later finding the Salinas River flowed into the Pacific at about the same point the maps depicted the mouth of the Buenaventura, Fr√©mont concluded that it was the source of the legend and applied the name \\"Rio San Buenaventura\\" to it. After Fr√©mont established that no rivers flowed across the Great Basin region to the Pacific, President Polk was reluctant to accept his conclusion.Fr√©mont, op, cit. However, after the premise was accepted that no east to west waterway flowed across the interior of the western United States, Fr√©mont and his father-in-law and political sponsor, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, directed their ambitions to a transcontinental railway, which was completed in 1869, after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì48 and the American Civil War.

Kaseko The term Kaseko is probably derived from the French expression casser le corps (break the body), which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance. Kaseko is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles derived from Africa, Europe and the Americas. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum) and snare drums, as well as saxophone, trumpet and occasionally trombone. Singing can be both solo and choir. Songs are typically call-and-response, as are Creole folk styles from the area, such as kawina. Kaseko emerged from the traditional Afro-Surinamese kawina music, which was played since the beginning of 1900 by Afro-Surinamese street musicians in Paramaribo. It evolved in the 1930s during festivities that used large bands, especially brass bands, and was called Bigi Pokoe (big drum music). Following World War II, jazz, calypso and other importations became popular, while rock and roll from the United States soon left its own influence in the form of electrified instruments. Hindi-Surinamese music/Baithak Gana Indian music arrived with immigrants from South Asia. This originally included folk music played with dhantal, tabla, sitar, harmonium and dholak, later including tassa drums. Music was mostly Hindu songs called bhajans, as well as filmi. The tan singing style is unique to the Indian community in Suriname and Guyana. Alioko is also a very popular form of religious music that developed through different cultures and made its way to Suriname. Using drums and forms of guitars they communicate with the spirits and gods through this ( al- ee- ock - oh ) music. Recorded Indian music in Suriname began with the release of King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe by Ramdew Chaitoe, in 1958. Chaitoe became very popular, and his music, which was religious in nature, left a lasting influence on future performers. However, no one very successful arose following Chaitoe, until 1968, when Dropati released Let's Sing and Dance, an album of religious songs that remains extremely popular. In 1958, East Indian music finally made its debut on the recording industry with the release of an album of devotional songs, by Ramdew Chaitoe of Suriname. His album titled, King of Suriname and The Star Melodies of Ramdew Chaitoe was quite appropriately named, as it made him a household name with East Indians not just in Suriname, but throughout the Caribbean. Although his songs were religious in nature, the use of the strong beats of the dhantal and dholak, coupled with his own creolised version of Hindi often had many listeners dancing as if it were a pop song. In fact, one song, \\"Raat Ke Sapna,\\" would go on to become a huge dance hit in the decades to follow. Although the release of King of Suriname presented a breakthrough for East Indian music, it was quite short lived, as few artists managed to succeed Ramdew Chaitoe in the years to follow. It was not until the 1960s that another Surinamese would catapult East Indian music onto the scene once again. In 1968, a woman by the name of Dropati debuted with an album of traditional wedding songs, titled, Lets Sing & Dance. Once again, although religious in nature, Dropati's songs, much like those of Ramdew Chaitoe, went on to become huge pop hits within the East Indian community. Dropati's epic songs such as \\"Gowri Pooja\\" and \\"Lawa\\" became such big hits that they firmly secured her name in history as one of the pillars of Indo-Caribbean music (Dropati, 1993). Lets Sing & Dance along with King of Suriname remain two of the best selling East Indian albums of all time, even to this day (Ramdew Chaitoe, 1993). The effects of the release of these two albums were tremendous. Not only did they prove East Indian music as a legitimate art form, but they also united the East Indians of the Caribbean regardless of whether they were Guyanese, Trinidadian, Jamaican or Surinamese. However, these two albums also showed the need for a more popular, non- religious form of East Indian music, one that would combine the high pitched dholak, dhantal & tassa drum beats with the folk and Hindi lyrics that made Lets Sing & Dance and King of Suriname/The Star Melodies Of Ramdew Chaitoe becoming so popular.https://web.archive.org/web/20000823032141/http://saxakali.com/caribbean/Hemchandra1.htm Hindustani Classical music in Suriname With the help of Government of India, the \\"Indiaase cultureel Centrum\\" was established under Embassy of India in Paramaribo.

Its provincial capital is the city Piacenza. As of 2016, it has a total population of 286,572 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 111.38 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city Piacenza has a population of 102,269, as of 2015. The provincial president is Patrizia Barbieri and it contains 48 comuni (singular: comune). The province dates back to its founding by the Romans in 218 BCE. History Piacenza was founded by the Romans for military purposes in 218 BCE. It was conquered by Carthaginian Hasdrubal II in 207 BCE and the city was sacked in 200 BCE by the Gauls. A key city in the region, it was destroyed by barbarians but the town was rebuilt under the rule of bishops in the 10th century. By the 12th century, the city was a free comune and it later fought against Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor as part of the Lombard League. In the Renaissance period it passed from French, to papal, to Viscontis, to Sforzas rule. Pope Paul III formed the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza and Piacenza became part of this duchy. It voted for a union between it and Piedmont in May 1848; this union was enacted in 1859. In October 2012, it was confirmed that the Province of Piacenza would be merged with the Province of Parma in 2014 to become the Province of Piacenza and Parma, despite controversy over the chosen name. However, after the dismissal of premier Mario Monti, the provincial union was cancelled. Geography The province of Piacenza is the westernmost of the nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in northwestern Italy. It is bounded on the east by the Province of Parma, and to the north by the Province of Cremona, the Province of Lodi, and the Province of Pavia in the region of Lombardy. The Province of Alessandria lies to the west in the region of Piedmont, and to the south lies the Province of Genoa in the region of Liguria. The northernmost part of the province is largely flat but the southernmost two thirds are hilly and extend to the Ligurian Apennine Mountains; the highest point in the province is the peak of Monte Bue which is above sea level. The alluvial Po Plain is agricultural land and there are many vineyards growing grapes from which the eighteen wines of the region are made. There is some light industry, mostly in the mechanical sector, and some of this is linked to the agriculture sector.

From 1946 to 1952, in the aftermath of World War II, it acted as an occupation and security force in the U.S. Occupation Zone of West Germany and Austria. Reason The concept of a police-type occupation of Germany arose from the consideration of plans for the most efficient employment of the relatively small forces available. The speed of redeployment in the fall of 1945, and the certainty that the occupational troop basis would have to be reduced speedily, dictated the utmost economy in the use of manpower. The basic principle of the police-type occupation‚Äîthat the lack of strength in the forces of occupation must be made up for by careful selection, rigid training, and high mobility‚Äîcannot be attributed to any single individual, or indeed to any single agency. Before any plans were worked out for the organization of the United States Constabulary, units of the United States Army assigned to occupational duties in Germany had experimented with the organization of parts of their forces into motorized patrols for guarding the borders and maintaining order in the large areas for which they were responsible. In September 1945, the G-2 Division of European Theater Headquarters put forward a plan, which was carried into effect towards the end of the years for the organization of a special security force known as the District Constabulary. In October 1945, the War Department asked European Theater Headquarters to consider the feasibility of organizing the major portion of the occupational forces into an efficient military police force on the model of state police or constabulary in the United States. Ideas crystallized rapidly. At the end of October 1945, General Eisenhower, then Theater Commander, announced to the proper authorities that the population of the United States Zone of Germany would ultimately be controlled by a super-police force or constabulary. In early November, the strength of the proposed constabulary was announced as 38,000. Planning was well advanced by the end of 1945, when the European Theater Headquarters notified the War Department that the constabulary would be organized as an elite force, composed of the highest caliber personnel obtainable under the voluntary re-enlistment program, and that it would be equipped with an efficient communications network, sufficient vehicles and liaison airplanes to make it highly mobile, and the most modern weapons. During the paper stage, the organization was known by a series of names. \\"State Police\\" was discarded for \\"State Constabulary.\\" Then it was thought that \\"State\\" would be confusing, as the main United States Zone of Germany had been divided, for purposes of civil administration, into three states, or L√§nder. Then the organization emerged from the planning stage, it was known as the \\"Zone Constabulary,\\" but before it became operational it was named \\"United States Constabulary.\\" Command and staff On 10 January 1946, Major General Ernest N. Harmon, wartime commander of the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions and the XXII Corps, was appointed Commanding General of the United States Constabulary. At the direction of Lieutenant General Lucian K. Truscott, Commanding General, Third United States Army, a small group was detailed to assist General Harmon in carrying forward the planning for the new force. Its headquarters was established at Bad T√∂lz. Theater Headquarters had already announced the principle that the Constabulary would be organized along geographical lines to coincide as nearly as possible with the major divisions of the German civil administration, in order to facilitate liaison with the German police and United States Offices of Military Government. Thus, there would be one Constabulary Headquarters for the entire United States Zone, a brigade headquarters at each of the capitals of the three German L√§nder, and group, squadron, and troop headquarters established at points selected for ease in performing the mission. Theater Headquarters had also directed that the organization charts of the Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron would be used in planning the organization of the Constabulary. The primary unit of the Constabulary, the troop, was organized on the pattern of the mechanized cavalry troop used in the war. In view of its tasks of road and border patrolling and its police-type jobs, the Constabulary needed a greater number of hand weapons and light vehicles, such as jeeps and armored cars. Each troop was divided for patrolling purposes into sections or teams, each of which was equipped with three jeeps and one armored car serving as a command vehicle and as support in case of emergency. A mobile reserve of one company equipped with light tanks was established in each Constabulary regiment. Horses were provided for patrolling in difficult terrain along the borders and motorcycles for the control of traffic on the super-highways (Autobahnen). Static border control posts were established at the crossing points. Uniforms An M8 in the Patton Museum, Ft. Knox KY The uniform of the Constabulary trooper was designed both to make him easily recognizable and to distinguish him as a member of an elite force. The \\"Lightning Bolt\\" shoulder patch consisting of a circular yellow shoulder patch with the border of the patch and the letter \\"C\\" in the middle being in blue. A red lightning bolt appeared diagonally angled downward from right to left in the center of the \\"C\\". The yellow, blue, and red combined the colors of the cavalry, infantry, and artillery. Their motto was \\"Mobility, Vigilance, Justice.\\" To make the troops more distinctive they were given US Cavalry bright golden yellow scarves, combat boots with a smooth outer surface designed to be spit shined, and helmet liners bearing the Constabulary insignia and yellow and blue stripes. One ex-member of the force remembered being called a \\"circle C cowboy\\" by soldiers from American regular army units. Creation To create a high morale in the Constabulary as quickly as possible, elements of the 1st and 4th Armored Divisions and certain cavalry groups were assigned to form the basis for the new organization. The units converted into Constabulary squadrons and regiments included armored infantry, field artillery, tank, tank destroyer, antiaircraft battalions, and cavalry squadrons. The Constabulary was also called the Circle C Cowboys because they had approximately 300 horses on duty in Berlin, the U.S. Zone of Germany, and Austria, with two veterinarians to treat them. Organization The VI Corps Headquarters became Headquarters, United States Constabulary on 1 May 1946. The 1st Armored Division, activated at Fort Knox, Kentucky, in June 1940 and one of the first American divisions to fight on the other side of the Atlantic, supplied many tank and infantry units. The 4th Armored Division furnished the three brigade headquarters for the Constabulary. These veteran units, seriously depleted by redeployment, now approached a task quite different from that of waging war, but one demanding initiative and high standards in training and discipline. Some of the combat units assigned to the Constabulary were carried temporarily as mere paper organizations, redeployment having taken all their officers and men. Other units had up to 75 percent of their allotted strength, but all the units taken together averaged only 25 percent of their authorized strength. In February 1946, Constabulary Headquarters was established in Bamberg. During the period when tactical units, released from the Third and Seventh Armies, were being redesignated as Constabulary units, the main tasks were training and reorganization. Continuous training was prescribed for the trooper so that he might attain an acceptable standard of discipline and all around efficiency in the use of weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment. Education and training Early in the planning stage the need for a Constabulary School became evident. The Constabulary trooper, it was seen, must know, not only the customary duties of a soldier, but also police methods, how to make arrests, and how to deal with a foreign population. A school was also needed to develop among the members of the Constabulary a spirit which would lift them towards the required high standards of personal appearance, soldierly discipline, and unquestioned personal integrity. The Constabulary School was established at Sonthofen, Germany, in a winter sports area at the foot of the Allgau Alps. This citadel had been formerly used as a Nazi school to train youthful candidates for positions of leadership in the Party. The curriculum for Constabulary officers and noncommissioned officers included instruction in the geography, history, and politics of Germany. The technical and specialist training for the trooper included the theory and practice of criminal investigation, police records, self-defense, and the apprehension of wanted persons. The trooper's indoctrination in the mission of the Constabulary gave him a knowledge of his responsibilities and the functions of the Constabulary. The Constabulary School had standards comparable to those of Army Service Schools in the United States. A graduate of Sonthofen was qualified, not only to perform his duties, but also to serve as an instructor in his unit. By the end of 1946, 5,700 officers and enlisted personnel had been graduated. A Trooper's Handbook was written to cover the basic rules to be followed by him in the execution of his duties. To prepare this manual, the Constabulary obtained the services of Colonel J. H. Harwood, formerly State Police Commissioner of Rhode Island. The training program, as originally planned, aimed at the progressive development of the Constabulary so as to attain a common standard of efficiency throughout the organization. 1 July 1946 was set as the date upon which the Constabulary would become operational and, in preparation for that day, the training program was divided into three phases. During the first phase, prior to 1 April, attention was concentrated on the training of cadre and on the establishment of regimental and squadron headquarters so that the Constabulary would be prepared to receive the approximately 20,000 men expected to fill the ranks. During this phase, the emphasis from the point of view of control by the main headquarters was shifted from the squadron to the regiment, since each of the latter directed three of the former. The second phase, between 1 April and 1 June, was a period of intensive training in the duties of both individuals and units. The final phase was planned as on-the-job training during June. The last phase, however, was not completed because of delay in receiving reinforcements. The Constabulary became operational on 1 July 1946 as scheduled, despite the fact that its training program had not been completed. Changes in the redeployment rules caused the loss within a few weeks of 8,000 troopers, 25 percent of the total strength. During the first two months of operations 14,000 men, or 42.7 percent of the total strength, were lost through redeployment. The replacement and training task at that time were staggering. To make matters worse, there was a critical shortage in the Constabulary of junior officers during the late summer of 1946. This delayed the Constabulary in attaining the desired standards in discipline and operations, and was the cause of many changes in operational techniques. Despite all of these difficulties, the Constabulary attained its goal of selecting high caliber personnel. The main reason for seeking troopers of high caliber and for giving them higher ratings than are available in other military organizations was the realization that the Constabulary was only as good as the individual trooper. Small groups of two or three troopers operated far from their headquarters and were empowered with unusual authority in matters of arrest, search, and seizure. In conducting their daily duties, they faced many temptations, such as those offered by persons willing to pay almost any price for immunity after crossing the border, or for illegal concessions in the black market. Maintaining high standards in the Constabulary was all the more difficult because most of the combat veterans had gone home and had been replaced by men in the age group of 18 to 22 years. Mission Constabulary operation near the Czechoslovak border in July 1946 The mission of the United States Constabulary was to maintain general military and civil security, to assist in the accomplishment of the objectives of the United States government in Germany, and to control the borders of the United States Zone. The Constabulary set up a system of patrols throughout the entire area and along the borders. The territory to be patrolled had an area of over 40,000 square miles (100,000 km2) and included nearly 1,400 miles of international and interzonal boundaries, extending from Austria in the South to the British Zone in the North, and from Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Zone in the East to the Rhine River and the French Zone in the West. Approximately the area of Pennsylvania in size, the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany had similar contours, with flat lands, hills, mountains, and forests, crisscrossed by many rivers and streams. More than sixteen million German people lived in this area, and it included many cities of considerable size. The entire Zone was covered by a network of roads, while here and there were the Autobahnen‚Äîthe four-lane express highways. Operations Constabulary map of U. S. zone of occupation in Germany At first the Constabulary tried to patrol everywhere in the Zone. Troopers traveled on country roads, through small villages, over narrow and rough mountainous roads. They moved up and down the streets of large cities like Munich and Stuttgart, and of the smaller ones like Fritzlar, Weiden, Hof, and Passau‚Äînames which have become as familiar to the Constabulary trooper as Pittsburgh, Akron, Richmond, Clay Center, and Abilene. Wherever patrols operated, they were in constant communication by radio or telephone with their platoon or troop headquarters, which were in turn linked in a chain of communications reaching up to Constabulary Headquarters. The telephone lines used by the Constabulary were, for the most part, those of the German system, although some military lines and equipment were also available. In addition to radio and telephone, the Constabulary was hooked up in a teletype system, which was the most comprehensive and effective communications network operated by the United States Army in Europe. In the performance of their mission, Constabulary patrols visited periodically the German mayors (B√ºrgermeister), German police stations, United States investigating agencies, and other military units in their areas. They were always prepared to assist any one or all of these. Like the State police units in the United States, Constabulary patrols worked closely with the municipal, rural, and border police, even though the German police were part of the administration of an occupied country. The Constabulary troopers became acquainted with the local policemen, received reports from them of what occurred since the last visit, and worked out with them methods of trapping criminals and of forestalling possible disturbances. As they roamed their beat in their yellow and blue striped jeep, each pair of Constabulary troopers was usually accompanied by a German policeman who rode in the back seat. The German policeman knew some English and the troopers were trained at the Constabulary school to understand a number of German phrases useful in police work. If the patrol investigated a disturbance in a German home, the troopers stood by while the German officer made the arrest. If they apprehended suspected displaced persons outside their camp, the troopers again stood by while the German policeman handled the situation. If the offender was an American or Allied soldier or civilian, the troopers made the arrest. This procedure built up the prestige of the new German police in the eyes of their own people. Border control was an important element in the security of the United States Zone. On 1 July 1946, the Constabulary replaced the troopers of the 1st, 3d, and 9th Infantry Divisions at the many static control posts along the borders. At these border posts, often in isolated locations, Allied soldiers met and exchanged greetings across the red and white barricades as they performed their duties of customs inspection, passport control, and law enforcement. During the second half of 1946, 120 border posts employing 2,800 Constabulary troopers turned back from the border over 26,000 undocumented transients. An additional 22,000 illegal crossers were apprehended by patrols within the ten-mile (16 km) border zone and turned over to military government. As the patrols of the Constabulary increased, illegal crossings showed a downward trend because travelers became aware of the regulations and the effectiveness of the Constabulary in their enforcement. Modernization As a result of continuous study of crime statistics, emphasizing the location and time of commission, the patrolling of the interior areas of the American Zone was modified so as to provide for more frequent visits to disorderly areas than to the relatively quiet localities. The potential sources of trouble were judged to be, not in rural areas where peasants gazed in wonder at Constabulary patrols, but in areas where large urban populations scrambled among ruins for food and for jerry-built shelter. Here the patrols, passing every two hours, found that they were missing the real disturbances. Night reports of holidays and weekends told of assaults, robbery, and other serious crimes being perpetrated, but too often the Constabulary was not on the spot to act. Operating procedures were changed to provide for concentration on the high-incident areas at critical times. In large cities, tanks, armored cars, and jeeps of the Constabulary paraded in the streets in considerable numbers to show the Germans that the Americans meant business, and were properly trained and equipped to meet emergencies. Troopers' lives As the Constabulary trooper became accustomed to his duties, he gained more confidence and self-assurance. He possessed a thorough knowledge of police functions; he learned not to abuse his authority. No situation seemed insoluble. Consequently, two or three men could answer a call for assistance where formerly a section or more had gone out. In the Kaserne the trooper had the recreational facilities and comforts which constituted his home life in Germany‚ÄîService Men's Clubs with their snack bars and entertainments, motion pictures, American Red Cross facilities, and trans- Atlantic telephone service. The trooper whose family lived in a military community found living and recreation within his means. All members of the Constabulary and their families had the possibility of interesting and enjoyable travel in Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy. During the first six months of its activities the Constabulary made 168,000 patrols in jeeps, tanks, and armored cars, and on horseback and on foot. Its troopers traveled on these patrols more than five million miles, mostly in jeeps. The mileage covered by the vehicles of the United States Constabulary was equivalent to nine vehicles circling the earth every twenty- four hours. The mileage covered by foot patrols was equivalent to circling the globe once each week. The liaison airplanes of the Constabulary flew more than 14,000 hours on 11,000 missions during the first six months' period. In 1946, the Constabulary made many swoop raids, known officially as \\"check and search operations,\\" against displaced persons' and refugees' camps and the German population. No raids were made unless requested by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, military commanders, military government, or investigative agencies which had reason to suspect black-market or subversive activities. The trooper operating in the municipalities was a deterrent to the individuals and groups who were the mainstay of the black market. In six months, 2,681 black-market transactions and 173 subversive acts were uncovered in Constabulary operations. The Constabulary assisted military government in the reorganization and development of the German police force. The Constabulary realized that its task would be greatly simplified with an increase in the strength and efficiency of the German police, a rise in the self-confidence of German police officers, and a gain in their prestige in the eyes of the civilian population. The ties between the two law-enforcement agencies steadily became stronger. The Constabulary left the less important matters in the hands of the German police and concentrated more and more on the apprehension of major criminals and black marketeers. Eventually, the United States Constabulary played mainly the role of adviser and supporter, ready to assist the German police on call. Equipment From the beginning, the Constabulary set high standards for itself. =Vehicles= The troopers were selected from the best soldiers available, and it was desired that all of them be volunteers. They were to be trained as both soldiers and policemen. They were to operate in an efficient, alert manner calculated to inspire confidence and respect in all persons they met, whether Germans, Allies, or Americans. Next to its need for well-qualified men, the Constabulary depended most, for success in its mission, upon its system of communications and upon vehicles suited to the needs of the job and to the condition of the German roads. Better radio equipment was being furnished at the end of 1946, though it was not yet of the standard of that used by State Police and Highway Patrol forces at home. The German telephone system, hampered by a lack of spare parts, was not in good condition. The jeep, while excellent for combat, did not prove to be the best vehicle for Constabulary patrol work. There were far too many accidents and some of them were undoubtedly due to defects in the design of the jeep with reference to the road conditions encountered. The jeep's best points were that it had the power and the sturdiness to travel German roads, then in a bad state of repair. If the roads were better maintained, the sedan would be a more satisfactory patrol vehicle. The Constabulary also made use of the M8 Greyhound armoured car and M24 Chaffee light tank. To maintain its mobility, the Constabulary waged a constant struggle to overcome deficiencies in its transportation facilities. The vehicles originally issued to the Constabulary, numbering approximately 10,000, were taken from the large concentrations of combat motor vehicles left behind by units returning to the United States for demobilization. Many of these vehicles were already worn out in the campaign and many others had deteriorated in disuse. The original condition of the vehicles placed a severe test upon the Constabulary which, at the time it was inaugurated, had no service elements. =Weaponry= The standard shoulder weapons of the Constabulary included the .30-06 cal M1 Garand rifle, .30-cal M1/M2 carbines, and .45-cal M1/M1A1Thompson submachine gun or M3 grease gun. Additionally, each Constabulary member was issued an M1911A1 .45 pistol. The standard 13-man (reconnaissance) patrol had seven rifle and five sub-machine gun armed men. Strength The US Constabulary consisted of up to 38,000 men organized into: * Headquarters, United States Constabulary, **Located first at Bamberg then moved to Stuttgart. * Three Brigades, **1st, 2nd and 3rd * 10 Regiments, ** 1st through 3rd and 5th through 9th, assigned to the brigades. ** The 4th Regiment, an independent unit with: ***Two squadrons in Austria and ***One squadron in West Berlin. Controlling: ** Thirty Squadrons. ***Each battalion- size squadron had five (at first) and then later on only four company-size troops. Disbanding The Constabulary was disbanded in 1952, after Germany had developed its own police forces. Many of the Constabulary troopers returned home and joined local and state police forces. As the perception of the threat to border security changed from one of criminal activity to a potential invasion by the Soviet Army, the border operations mission along the Soviet zones in Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Austria was taken over by armored cavalry units of the U.S. Army.Kendall Gott document While the Constabulary did not have a direct successor, its duty of close cooperation with German authorities is now maintained by Military and Civilian Police Officers of the U.S. Armed Forces. A strong working relationship continues to exist today between German Police Forces and United States Forces Europe Police who operate out of U.S. military installations throughout Germany. Joint patrols involving U.S. Military Police, U.S. Army Civilian Police, and local German Police are still relatively commonplace throughout towns near U.S. military installations in Germany. These patrols are directed at enhancing the safety and security of military and German communities by instilling a culture of mutual trust and cooperation between U.S. and German Police forces.

The first tropical cyclone of the season, Anita developed from a tropical wave on August 29 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. It tracked westward into an area with conditions favorable for further development, and quickly intensified into a hurricane by late on August 30. Initially, Anita was forecast to strike Texas, though a building ridge turned it to the west-southwest. The hurricane rapidly strengthened to attain peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h), and on September 2 Anita made landfall in eastern Tamaulipas as a Category 5 hurricane. It quickly weakened as it crossed Mexico, and after briefly redeveloping into a tropical depression in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Anita dissipated on September 4 to the south of the Baja California Peninsula. Anita was the first major hurricane to form in The Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Ethel of 1960. The hurricane produced light rainfall and high tides along the Gulf Coast of the United States. Some low- level flooding was reported, but damage was slight. In Mexico, the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall. The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico, with about 25,000 people left homeless. The rainfall, reaching over 17.52 inches (445 mm), caused flooding and mudslides which killed eleven people in Tamaulipas. Overall damage is unknown. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5 mph (7 km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230 miles (370 km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana. With a ridge of high pressure to its north, the depression tracked westward. Favorable conditions persisted for several days prior to the arrival of the depression, and as such the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Anita. The storm tracked slowly over warm water temperatures, and throughout its duration it was embedded within warm, moist tropical air; Anita rapidly organized and attained hurricane status late on August 30; this is the latest date for the first hurricane since 1967. Initially it threatened to strike Texas, though building high pressures to the north of the hurricane turned Anita to the west-southwest. The hurricane developed a well-defined eye, and Anita began to rapidly intensify late on September 1 after attaining major hurricane status. During a two-day period up to its peak intensity, Anita deepened at a rate of 2 mbar per hour, and on September 2 the hurricane reached peak winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) while located just offshore northeastern Mexico, making Anita a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricane Anita maintained its strength as it approached land, and at 1100 UTC on September 2 it made landfall on Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas, about 145 miles (235 km) south of Brownsville, Texas or 80 miles (130 km) north of Tampico, Mexico. Moving ashore with a pressure of 926 mbar, Anita was the third most intense tropical cyclone to strike the nation, and was the most intense hurricane to hit from the Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, and on September 3, about 25 hours after moving ashore, Anita emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression. Reclassified as Tropical Depression Eleven, the system continued to the west, and weakened further after encountering cooler water temperatures. The depression gradually lost its deep convection, and on September 4 it dissipated off of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Preparations Hurricane Anita near its Mexico landfall Shortly after first developing, one oil company evacuated its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, with several other companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat of the developing disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas. Though the National Hurricane Center did not issue hurricane warnings for Mexico, officials warned the Mexican government of the potential danger of the hurricane. Across the northeastern coastline of the country, 35,000 people evacuated prior to the arrival of the hurricane, including all of the residents in the village where the hurricane struck. The Mexican army assisted in evacuations and preparing emergency shelters. Impact Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Anita =United States= As the precursor tropical disturbance crossed southern Florida, it dropped light rainfall of over 1 inch (25 mm) in the Miami area. Later, as a developing tropical depression, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall in southern Louisiana; one station near Galliano reported over 3 inches (76 mm) of precipitation. Hurricane Anita produced a storm tide of 2 feet (0.6 m) above normal in Grand Isle, which resulted in hundreds of families being asked to leave their homes. The hurricane produced above-normal tides along the Texas coastline, which closed several highways including Texas State Highway 87. The northern periphery of Hurricane Anita produced light to moderate rainfall across the southern portion of the state, which peaked at 4.97 inches (126 mm) at Rio Grande City. Damage in the state was minor; on South Padre Island damage was limited to a few broken windows. =Mexico= Hurricane Anita near landfall Hurricane Anita made landfall in a sparsely populated portion of Mexico; as a result, few meteorological statistics exist. A station near where the hurricane moved ashore recorded 17.52 inches (445 mm) of precipitation in six hours, which resulted in severe flooding and mudslides. Winds along the eastern Mexico coastline were estimated at over 100 mph (160 km/h). The hurricane caused extensive damage to fishing and farming communities in northeastern Mexico. Strong winds destroyed thousands of homes and left about 25,000 people homeless, according to newspaper reports from Mexico City. The winds destroyed the roofs of most buildings near where the hurricane moved ashore, and also caused widespread power outages which disrupted communications. Heavy rainfall destroyed or obstructed roadways across the region, with some flooded avenues in Tampico and reports of flooded highways near Ciudad Victoria. Eleven people were killed in floods and mudslides across Tamaulipas. In all, at least 50,000 people were affected by the hurricane in Mexico. Aftermath The name Anita was retired following this storm, and will never be used for an Atlantic hurricane again. Shortly after the hurricane made landfall, the government of Mexico sent two trucks of food to the areas of greatest impact. Additionally, officials permitted full use of the Mexican railway system to facilitate the distribution of aid. Three municipalities were also declared disaster areas following the storm. In Texas, the combination of moderate rainfall and high tides into low-lying marshland led to a mosquito outbreak near Galveston following the storm.

Named after the River Mersey, the ship is the first to be named Mersey in 84 years. Various tenders (predominantly s) were renamed Mersey during their service with Mersey Division Royal Naval Reserve (HMS Eaglet) between the early 1950s and late 1970s. She was built by Vosper Thornycroft in Southampton to serve as a fishery protection vessel within the United Kingdom's waters along with her two sister ships and . All three were commissioned into service in 2003 to replace the five older s. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 28 November 2003. At that time, Mersey was not expected to commence duties until February 2004. Mersey was the last Royal Navy ship to be launched from Vosper Thornycroft at its Woolston shipyard; Jennie Reeve, wife of Rear-Admiral Jonathon Reeve, Chief of Fleet Support, was the ship's sponsor. Operational history Visiting Guyana in March 2016 For the first thirteen years of operation, Mersey operated around the United Kingdom on Fishery Protection duties. In October 2013, Mersey was dry docked in Falmouth. In January 2016, Mersey became the second River-class OPV to be deployed to the Caribbean Sea following on from her sister Severn in 2015. In May 2016, Mersey was dry docked in Martinique as part of her mid-deployment maintenance period. By July, Mersey had been relieved by and was deployed on migrant patrols in the Aegean via a port call in Gibraltar. Mersey returned to Portsmouth on 10 February 2017 after 13 months away to resume her fishery protection duties. On 3 January 2019, Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson confirmed that HMS Mersey has been deployed to assist UK & French authorities with illegal migrant crossings in the English Channel. Future On 24 April 2017, in a written answer to a question raised by Sir Nicholas Soames, Parliamentary Under- Secretary for Defence Harriet Baldwin stated that Mersey would be decommissioned in 2019. In March 2018, Baldwin's successor Guto Bebb revealed that ¬£12.7M had been allocated from the EU Exit Preparedness Fund to preserve the three Batch 1 ships, should they be needed to control and enforce UK waters and fisheries following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. On 22 November 2018, Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, announced that three Batch 1 River-class ships would be retained in service and forward operated from their affiliated ports.

Its capital is the city of Ravenna. As of 2015, it has a population of 391,997 inhabitants over an area of , giving it a population density of 210.81 inhabitants per square kilometre. Its provincial president is Claudio Casadio. History Ravenna was first inhabited by Italic tribes from northern regions, and was conquered in 191 BCE by the Roman Republic. A port was constructed near Classe, and the Adriatic fleet was based in Ravenna. In 402 CE, Ravenna became the capital of the Western Roman Empire, which endured until the collapse of the empire and the fall of Rome in 476. Following this, the Barbarian Kings Odoacer and then Theodoric controlled Ravenna until it was conquered by the Byzantine Empire in 540; the Byzantines announced it to be their Exarchate. It continued to be under Byzantine rule until it was invaded by the Lombards in 751, and it was then annexed by King of the Franks Pippin the Younger. It was placed under papal rule by Pippin the Younger in 756 or 757. Ravenna was subsequently ruled by the Holy See until it was given independence in the 12th century. The papacy gained control again in 1278 and was led by papal vicars until it was invaded by Venice in 1441. The War of the League of Cambrai took place near Ravenna in 1512, in which the papal forces were defeated, but the French forces were almost entirely killed and were driven from Italy. It remained under the rule of the Holy See until it became part of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1921, uprisings in Ravenna triggered a rapid advance of the Fascist movement in the region. Buildings belonging to the Republicans and socialists were seized or burnt down by Italo Balbo, and on July 29, he and his men moved throughout the provinces of Ravenna and Forli, burning every socialist organisation headquarters in a night of terror which was later called the \\"column of fire\\". This was a pivotal moment in the advance of Fascism in northern Italy. Geography The province of Ravenna is one of nine provinces in the region of Emilia-Romagna in the northeast of Italy. It is on the east of the region and abuts onto the Adriatic Sea. The Province of Ferrara lies immediately to the north and the Province of Bologna is to the west. The Metropolitan City of Florence in the region of Tuscany lies to the southwest, and the Province of Forl√¨-Cesena to the south. The provincial capital is the city of Ravenna, which is situated a few miles inland and is connected to the Adriatic Sea by the Candiano Canal.

The fourth named storm and second hurricane of the season, Diana developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on August 4\\\\. Forming as a tropical depression, the system brushed Honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day. Continuing to gradually strengthen, Diana made its first landfall in Mexico's Yucat√°n Peninsula as a strong tropical storm late on August 5\\\\. The cyclone weakened slightly due to land interaction, before emerging into the Bay of Campeche on August 6\\\\. Once over water, warm sea surface temperatures allowed Diana to quickly become a hurricane and later peak as a Category 2 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale on August 7\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, with winds of 100 mph (165 km/h). Rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of Mexico, with Diana diminishing to a tropical depression roughly 24 hours after moving onshore. The cyclone later emerged into the Gulf of California on August 9 shortly before dissipating. The remnant disturbance was monitored until losing its identity over Arizona on August 14\\\\. Diana left relatively minor impacts in the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Some locations observed tropical storm-force sustained winds and gusts, while heavy rains left street flooding in the Chetumal area. Along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, the hurricane produced torrential rains exceeding in some places. The ensuing floods left about 3,500 people homeless and destroyed roughly 155 mi¬≤ (400 km¬≤) of farmland. Numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris, cutting communication with several communities. In all, Diana killed 139 people in Mexico and resulted in approximately $90.7 million (1990 USD) in damage. The remnant disturbance caused street flooding in Arizona. The World Meteorological Organization retired the name Diana following the season due to the extensive loss of life and damage caused by the storm. Meteorological history Hurricane Diana originated from a tropical wave which emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 27\\\\. Unfavorable conditions initially prohibited tropical cyclogenesis, with the wave remaining disorganized until reaching the eastern Caribbean Sea. The system entered the Caribbean Sea through the southern Windward Islands, where barometric pressures fell slightly, decreasing by 3.5 mbar (hPa; 0.1 inHg) in 24 hours. Upper-level air data from the Lesser Antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone. The first reconnaissance aircraft flight into the wave indicated no low-level circulation, but a relatively large and increasing amount of thunderstorm activity. The system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the Netherlands Antilles, as indicated by satellite images and surface observations. After satellite imagery observed a cyclonic rotation in the low-level convection, the fifth tropical depression of the season developed over the Caribbean around 00:00 UTC on August 4, while located about east of Isla de Providencia. However, this was based on surface observations, and the formation of a tropical cyclone operationally remained unconfirmed until another reconnaissance aircraft flight later that day. The depression initially moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough. Around 00:00 UTC on August 5, about 24 hours after developing, the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm while offshore northeastern Honduras; the National Hurricane Center assigned the name Diana to the system. Diana would subsequently strengthen further, with winds reaching 65 mph (105 km/h) before the storm made landfall near Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, around 20:00 UTC later that day. The storm weakened while crossing the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and emerged into the Bay of Campeche early on August 6 with winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). Upon entering the Bay of Campeche, Diana began moving nearly due west as a result of a weakening trough of low pressure. With conditions being more favorable in the Bay of Campeche, Diana quickly intensified, becoming a hurricane around 06:00 UTC on August 7\\\\. Twelve hours later, the cyclone intensified into a Category 2 hurricane and attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). At 19:00 UTC on August 7, just one hour after attaining peak intensity, Diana made landfall in Tamiahua, Tamaulipas, at the same intensity. Moving inland, Diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of Mexico, quickly deteriorating from a low-end Category 2 hurricane to a strong tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on August 8\\\\. The system continued westward and weakened to a tropical depression roughly 12 hours later while centered near Mexico City. The weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central Mexico and emerged into the Pacific Ocean on August 9, before dissipating as a tropical cyclone over the Gulf of California. The remnants of Diana curved northward around the eastern periphery of an upper-cyclone and tracked through the Gulf of California. Convection flared up before the remnant disturbance moved ashore in northwestern Sonora. The remnants of Diana entered Arizona and dissipated by early on August 14. Preparations In anticipation of Diana's first landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued on August 5 for Canc√∫n, Mexico, southward to Belize City, Belize, on August 5, including the offshore islands from both nations; a tropical storm warning indicates that tropical storm force winds, 39 to 73 mph (39 to 118 km/h), are expected within 24 hours. Eleven hours later, the tropical storm warning was extended as far as Carmen, but was discontinued for the entire east coast of Belize. Civil defense officials in Quintana Roo recommended that residents in coastal areas and in homes with weak construction to evacuate. The civil defense also set up emergency shelters in Punta Allen, Punta Herrero, and Xcalak. The Mexican Coast Guard was placed on alert and shipping activity around Quintana Roo ceased during the evening of August 5, as tides were expected to range from above normal. Additionally, officials expressed concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of of rainfall in areas near the storm's path. After Diana made landfall on the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 6, all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinued. Diana then threatened the mainland east coast of Mexico. A hurricane watch was issued for Tuxpan to Boca de Jesus Maria at 21:00 UTC on August 6; a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours, such as winds of at least 74 mph (119 km/h). Early on August 7, the National Hurricane Center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours, and as a result, a hurricane warning was issued for Nautla to Le Pesca. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued for La Pesca to Boca de Jesus Maria. Later that day, a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area, stretching from Nautla to Lerdo de Tejada. The National Hurricane Center also predicted precipitation totals of and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where Diana was projected to make landfall. According to Miguelangel Rebolledo, the captain of the port of Tuxpan, about 300 people fled low-lying areas. State and federal officials prepared 10,000 packages of emergency supplies, food, and medicine and moved them to several locations along the coast. Police and Armed Forces were placed on alert. By 00:00 UTC on August 8, all of the watches and warnings in place were officially discontinued. Impact Rainfall from Diana in Mexico =Mexico= Offshore Quintana Roo, the island of Cozumel reported sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). While crossing over the Yucat√°n Peninsula, sustained winds of 34 mph (54 km/h) and gusts to 40 mph (65 km/h) were observed in M√©rida. In addition, wind gusts of 37 and 45 mph (60 and 73 km/h) were reported in the towns of Felipe Carrillo Puerto and Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, respectively. Diana also caused heavy rain across the area, though damage is unknown. Due to heavy rainfall, minor street flooding occurred in Chetumal, Quintana Roo. Along the Gulf of Mexico, the storm produced storm surge and abnormally high tides, with waves up to 12 ft (3.6 m) in height. Rough seas resulted in the closures of the ports at Coatzacoalcos and Tampico. Diana produced torrential rainfall while crossing the country, which peaked at in Aquism√≥n, San Luis Potos√≠. Heavy rainfall triggered mudslides and flooding, mostly in the east-central portion of Mexico. The Comisi√≥n Nacional del Agua noted that at least seven rivers in the lower P√°nuco River basin threatened to overflow their banks in the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco, San Luis Potos√≠, and Tamaulipas. The rainfall caused extensive property damage, destroying numerous houses and leaving 3,500 homeless. Flooding inundated highways and railways across six states and destroyed about 155 mi¬≤ (400 km¬≤) of farmland. The states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, and Puebla were hardest hit, with over 75,000 people affected by the hurricane. In Poza Rica, high winds toppled trees and electricity poles, which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city. Fallen trees and telephone wires also blocked some streets in the area, but the major roads remained open. Farther south, flooding left Federal Highway 185 impassable near Coatzacoalcos for a few days. Approximately 80% of apple, coffee, peach, and pear crops were lost in the municipality of Huayacocotla. In P√°nuco, flooding forced more than 2,000 families to flee their homes. Diana caused at least 20 deaths and left 18 people missing in the city. Local crops experienced significant damage, especially cotton, rice, and soybeans. Throughout the state of Veracruz, the storm destroyed about of banana, citrus, corn, and cotton crops. In Hidalgo, several miners died after their truck plunged into a ravine. The San Juan River overflowed in the town of Huejutla de Reyes, sweeping away hundreds of homes and some people in one neighborhood. Diana also damaged at least 110 schools and 25 public buildings throughout in Hidalgo. Flooding washed out or damaged four federal highways and six state highways. The agricultural industry in Hidalgo, which had not fully recovered from a severe frost in December 1988, experienced significant effects. About of croplands suffered damage, mainly impacting coffee, rice, and bean crops. Excluding the 56 people still missing by the end of 1990, Diana caused at least 139 deaths and $90.7 million in damage. However, some sources claim that there were as much as 391 fatalities and losses incurred by the storm totaled to $94.5 million. In addition, it is estimated that Diana injured 25,000 people. =Elsewhere= While Diana was crossing the Yucat√°n Peninsula, it dropped light rainfall in Belize, peaking at in an unspecified location. The remnants of Hurricane Diana eventually moved into the Southwestern United States, bringing heavy rainfall to the region. In Imperial County, California, golf-ball sized hail was reported by the residents, along with rain and lightning, causing brief power outages throughout the county. A police dispatch of Imperial County also noted local flooding, which resulted in traffic disruptions. The remnants of Diana also dropped light rainfall in San Diego County, California, with the city of San Diego receiving only a trace of rain, Vista reporting 0.09 in (2 mm), Del Mar had 0.08 in (2 mm), and Oceanside measuring 0.3 in (8 mm). In Arizona, the remnants of Diana contributed to record cold temperatures for August in Phoenix. On August 14, the city had a high temperature of , which was below normal for that date. In Maricopa County, of rain was observed. Heavy precipitation, with in Desert Hills, which fell in less than two hours. Several weather-related car accidents occurred, but none were serious. In Apache Junction, police and city officials rushed to close flooded streets, including portions of state highways and underpasses of Interstate 17. Crews were pumping of water from the underpasses of Interstate 17, but their efforts were futile. A portion of State Route 87 between Gila River Indian Community and the intersection with State Route 187 was shut down due to flooding. In Sacaton, about two-thirds of the city was inundated with at least of water. Aftermath Following the storm, the Mexican Armed Forces delivered food and basic health care supplies to victims. In addition, there was also a mass vaccination against typhoid. Officials delivered about 8,000 boxes of blankets, clothing, and food in total to the 55 worst impacted communities in Veracruz. The Mexican Army and Civil Defense of Veracruz deployed 36 medical brigades to attend to those injured during the storm. By August 11, 120 families in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region of Puebla had received construction materials to rebuild their homes. Due to its impact, the name Diana was retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1991, and will never be used again for another Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with Dolly for the 1996 season. This Hurricane Diana is not to be confused with the 1955 season's Hurricane Diane, which was also retired.

String band music, quadrille, b√©l√© music and traditional storytelling are also popular. Soca Soca is a form of dance music that originated in Trinidad and Tobago from calypso music. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from Trinidad, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, some bands from Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Haiti, Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles. The nickname of the Trinidad and Tobago national football team, the Soca Warriors, refers to this musical genre. Big drum Big drum music is performed throughout the Windward Islands and is especially known in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines. The drums are traditionally made from tree trunks, but are more often made from rum kegs now. The socially aware or satirical lyrics are usually performed by a female singer called a chantwell, and is accompanied by dancers in colorful skirts and headdresses. Big Drum is commonly performed at weddings and other celebrations, especially the launches of boats. Calypso Calypso, with its satirical and socio-political lyrics, was developed in the 18th century as a fusion of African and French music styles. It eventually accompanied the rise of steelpan music. Steelpan were imported to Saint Vincent quickly. Calypso's political lyrics have continued to be an important part of the genre. In 1984, a Vincentian musician named Becket released a song called \\"Horne fuh dem\\", which helped defeat the ruling party in that year's election. Festivals and holidays The Carnival is the biggest holiday in Saint Vincent. It is held in the last week of June and the first of July, and is known on the islands as Vincy mas. Festivities include calypso, soca and steelpan performances, many of them in large, competitive formats.Cultural Profiles Project: Holidays Other holidays with musical components include the Christmas celebrations, which occur beginning on December 15 and include carolling, concerts and bicycle races. In addition St. Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the festival ‚ÄúNine Mornings‚Äù and ‚ÄúNine Nights of Lights‚Äù. Union Island holds an annual calypso competition, as well as the Big Drum Festival. Popular singers The lead singer from the band Mattafix, known for their hit single \\"Big City Life\\", lived in St. Vincent for many years. A multi-platinum popular singer is Kevin Lyttle, whose \\"Turn Me On\\" topped charts across Europe.SVG Tourism Becket Cyrus is also well known within the island, with his hit \\"Teaser\\" earlier on in the country's history. Of the late there have been quite a lot of young and upcoming artists whose music is spreading throughout the Caribbean and the United States. These include Bomani, Skarpyon, and Jamesy P.

The premise of each game in the series is to emulate the sport of basketball, more specifically, the National Basketball Association. The series was originally published by Sega Sports, and is now published by 2K Sports. All of the games in the franchise have been developed by Visual Concepts. The series consists of eighteen main installments and several spinoff-style titles. It has seen releases on eighteen different platforms. The NBA 2K series has also been used in eSports. Their primary rival is NBA Live by EA Sports. Gameplay Each installment in the NBA 2K series emulates the National Basketball Association, and present improvements over the previous installments. As such, gameplay simulates a typical game of basketball, with the player controlling an entire team or a select player; objectives coincide with the rules of basketball and presentation resembles actual televised NBA games. Various game modes have been featured in the series, allowing for gameplay variety. Numerous elements of the games feature customizable options. Each game features the teams and players from the current NBA season; historic NBA teams and players have also been featured, as have EuroLeague teams and (starting with NBA 2K20) WNBA teams.

A staple of the series is its career mode, which has been described as a sports-themed role-playing video game. ESPN NBA Basketball was the first game in the series to feature such a mode, but it wasn't until NBA 2K10 and its successors that the mode became a more integral part of the series. The mode was initially titled 24/7, before being changed to MyPlayer, and settling on MyCareer. The modes center on the basketball career of the player's created player; the player customizes several aspects of their player and plays through their career in the NBA. Key events in the player's career are depicted, such as the draft and their retirement ceremony. A storyline is often present in the modes, and high school and college-level basketball has also been depicted. The player upgrades their player's attributes as they play, and can participate in off-court activities.Mazique, Brian (October 2, 2012). \\"NBA 2K13: Tips for Building a Beastly 'My Player' in My Career Mode\\".

Elements of the series that are frequently praised include its presentation, specifically its commentary, attention to detail, and soundtrack, its abundance of content, its overall gameplay, and its consistency in terms of yearly releases without any drastic dips in quality. Technical issues have plagued many of the releases, however, particularly in regards to the online components. The introduction of microtransactions into the series has also been scrutinized, while the story- focused incarnations of the MyCareer mode have received mixed responses.Wood, Austin (January 9, 2014). \\"2K Sports Needs To Ease Up On All The Microtransactions In NBA 2K14\\".

Legal issues Two separate lawsuits have been filed against Take-Two related to their recreation of tattoos on NBA players recreated in the series. The first suit was filed by Solid Oak Sketches, filed in January 2016, after trying to seek a licensing agreement to use the registered copyrighted tattoos with Take-Two. LeBron James had submitted a statement supporting Take-Two, in that he asserted he has given the company the license use his image in their cases, which included his tattoos from Solid Oak Sketches, but this conclusion was thrown out by the judge. The case currently remains pending as of September 2018. In March 2020, a federal District Court judge ruled that while the tattoos were copyrighted elements their use in the games were small enough to meet de minimis considerations, and that further, due to the nature of tattooing, an implicit license to use the tattoos was granted by the license granted for using the players' likeness. The judge summarily dismissed the case, as well as asserting that broadly, video games using licensed likenesses of players with their tattoos will be using the tattoo art within fair use. A separate lawsuit was filed by tattoo artist James Hayden in December 2017; Hayden asserted that Take-Two's recreation of his tattoos designed for NBA players like LeBron James within NBA 2K16 and onward were copyright infringements. Take-Two sought a summary judgement to close the case, but by March 2019, the preceding judge gave partial summary to Take-Two but left the main question of copyright infringement open. Hayden has failed to register the copyrights until after NBA 2K16 was released, leaving 2K17 and onward potentially liable to be determined in a court trial. One question raised by the judge was whether the NBA 2K series was an ongoing game with annual updates, or if each release was considered a substantial new work, meaning that any copyright violation would apply repeatedly to all three post-2016 games in the series or as a singular violation.

Medieval bestiaries usually depict its fur as reddish-brown or black. Because its horns were useless for self-defense, the bonnacon was said to expel large amounts of caustic feces from its anus at its pursuers, burning them and thereby ensuring its escape. Textual history The first known description of the bonnacon comes from Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia: The popularity of the Naturalis Historia in the Middle Ages led to the bonnacon's inclusion in medieval bestiaries. In the tradition of the Physiologus, bestiaries often ascribed moral and scriptural lessons to the descriptions of animals, but the bonnacon gained no such symbolic meaning. Manuscript illustrations of the creature may have served as a source of humor, deriving as much from the reaction of the hunters as from the act of defecation. The Aberdeen Bestiary describes the creature using similar language to Pliny, though the beast's location is moved from Paeonia to Asia: The bonnacon is also mentioned in the life of Saint Martha in the Golden Legend, a 13th-century hagiographical work by Jacobus de Voragine. In the story, Saint Martha encounters and tames the Tarasque, a dragon-like legendary creature said to be the offspring of the biblical Leviathan and the bonnacon. In this account, the bonnacon (here: bonacho or onacho) is said to originate in Galatia.

The eleventh tropical cyclone and sixth hurricane of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season, Klaus developed from a tropical wave on October 3 a short distance east of Dominica. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on October 5. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12 miles (19 km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong wind shear, which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the Bahamas before dissipating on October 9 under the influence of developing tropical storm, Marco. Heavy rainfall on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties occurred and 1,500 people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was affected with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115 miles (185 km/h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Klaus was located in an area of 29 mph (47 km/h) of wind shear, although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 83.1 ¬∞F (28.4 ¬∞C). Tracking through a highly baroclinic environment, the storm became better organized, and at 1200 UTC on October 5 Klaus attained hurricane status about 30 miles (50 km) east of Antigua; shortly thereafter, it passed 12 miles (19 km) east of Barbuda, its closest point of approach to the Lesser Antilles. Klaus reached peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of , though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear. At the time the hurricane was forecast to continue tracking to the north-northwest. However, after weakening to a tropical storm on October 6, Klaus turned westward. Klaus continued tracking just north of the Lesser Antilles, and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on October 8 to the north of Puerto Rico. Later that day, convection redeveloped over the center, and Klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast Bahamas; it briefly reached winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). A low pressure area to its west over Cuba had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface, and on October 9 it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming Marco, and Klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on October 9. The remnant moisture continued to the northwest, reaching the coast of South Carolina by October 11. Preparations Shortly after Klaus attained tropical storm status early on October 4, a tropical storm warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands from Saint Martin to Antigua, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of France issued a tropical storm warning for Guadeloupe. A hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands, though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken. In Guadeloupe, officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in Martinique, Sint Maarten, and Antigua. The VC Bird International Airport was closed during the passage of the hurricane. Later in its duration, the government of The Bahamas issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern Bahamas, though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated. Due to Hurricane Klaus, Space Shuttle Columbia's launch was delayed. Impact Hurricane Klaus dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the Lesser Antilles, potentially as high as 15 inches (380 mm); the hurricane affected many areas struck by Hurricane Hugo in the previous year. On Barbados, flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few families to move to safer areas; lightning from the outskirts of the storm left a portion of the island without power. High winds and rainfall affected the island of Saint Lucia, which destroyed about 15% of the nation's banana crop for the year; damage totaled about $1 million (1990 USD). The rainfall resulted in severe flooding on Martinique, which accrued to almost 10 feet (3 m) in some locations; two sisters drowned near Saint-Joseph after a bridge was washed away. Several landslides were reported on the island. The passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems. 750 people evacuated their homes in Le Lamentin due to flooding, and a total of 1,500 residents were left homeless on the island. Offshore, rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel, leaving its two passengers drifting on the boat for 25 days before being rescued about 640 miles (1035 km) to the north-northwest of Martinique. In all, seven people were killed on the island. On Dominica, winds from the hurricane damaged power lines and downed trees in the northern portion of the island. High winds on Antigua damaged a few roofs, and also downed communications from two radio networks. The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall on the United States Virgin Islands, reaching about 1.25 inches (32 mm) on Saint Thomas; wind gusts peaked at 33 mph (53 km/h) on Saint Croix. Moderate rainfall continued into the Turks and Caicos Islands, with Grand Turk reporting a total of 4 inches (100 mm) in 36 hours. On the east coast of Florida, Klaus produced 15 foot (4.5 m) waves and tides of 3 feet (1 m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along the east coast, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10‚Äì15 inches (250‚Äì380 mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region. Retirement Due to its impact on Martinique, the government of France requested the retirement of the name Klaus; the World Meteorological Organization retired the name from the list of tropical cyclone names in the following year and replaced it with the name Kyle.

Romaniote, and Yevanitika is a Greek dialect formerly used by the Romaniotes and by the Constantinopolitan Karaites (in whose case the language is called Karaitika or Kar√¶o-Greek).Wexler, P. Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of \\"Jewish\\" Languages, p. 17. 2006Dalven, R. Judeo-Greek. In: Encyclopedia Judaica. 1971:426 The Romaniotes are a group of Greek Jews whose presence in the Levant is documented since the Byzantine period. Its linguistic lineage stems from the Jewish Koine spoken primarily by Hellenistic Jews throughout the region, and includes Hebrew and Aramaic elements. It was mutually intelligible with the Greek dialects of the Christian population. The Romaniotes used the Hebrew alphabet to write Greek and Yevanic texts. Judaeo- Greek has had in its history different spoken variants depending on different eras, geographical and sociocultural backgrounds. The oldest Modern Greek text was found in the Cairo Geniza and is actually a Jewish translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes (Kohelet).Ernst Bremer, Susanne R√∂hl. Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, pp. 30-35, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2006 Origin of name The term Yevanic is an artificial creation from the Biblical word ◊ô◊ï◊ü (YƒÅwƒÅn) referring to the Greeks and the lands that the Greeks inhabited. The term is an overextension of the Greek word ·º∏œâŒΩŒØŒ± (Ionia in English) from the (then) easternmost Greeks to all Greeks. The word for Greece in modern Israeli Hebrew is Yavan; likewise, the word yevanit is used to refer to the modern Greek language in Hebrew. Geographical distribution A small number of Romaniote Jews in the United States, Israel, Greece, and Turkey have some knowledge of the Judaeo-Greek language. The language is highly endangered and could completely die out. There are no preservation programs to promote or to revive the language.Vlachou, Evangelia, Papadopoulou, Chrysoula, Kotzoglou, Georgios. Before the flame goes out: documentation of the Yevanic dialect. 2014. Sponsored by the Latsis Foundation. In 1987, there were 35 speakers left in Israel, the majority located in Jerusalem. This population may have died out. , a few elderly Jews in Ioannina, Greece still speak the language. Historical background Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor, Southern Italy, the Balkans and Eastern Europe had originally a Greek-speaking Jewish community. After the arrival of Jewish refugees into these areas from the Iberian Peninsula, Northern Italy and Western Europe the Greek-speaking Jewish communities began to almost disappear while integrating into the group of the newcomers which did not constituted in every area of their new homeland the majority.Bowman, Steven (1985). \\"Language and Literature\\". The Jews of Byzantium 1204-1453. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press. p. 758.Avigdor Levy; The Jews of the Ottoman Empire, New Jersey, (1994) The immigration of Italian and Spanish-speaking people into Greece in the late 15th century altered the culture and vernacular of the Greek Jews. A lot locales picked up on Judeo-Spanish language and customs, however some communities in Epirus, Thessaly, the Ionian Islands, Crete, Constantinople and Asia Minor kept the old, so-called \\"Romaniote minhag\\" and the Judaeo-Greek language. By the early 20th century, the Jews living in places such as Ioannina, Arta, Preveza, and Chalkida still spoke a form of Greek that slightly differentiated the Greek of their Christian neighbors. These differences, semantically, do not go beyond phonetic, intonational, and lexical phenomena. It is different from other Jewish languages, in that there is no knowledge of any language fragmentation ever taking place. Current status The assimilation of the Romaniote communities by the Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, the emigration of many of the Romaniotes to the United States and Israel, the murder of many of the Romaniotes during the Holocaust have been the main reasons of the decline of Judao-Greek. The survivors were too scant to continue an environment in which this language was dominant and more recent generations of the survivors have moved to new locations such as Greece, Israel, and The United States and now speak the respective languages of those countries; Standard Modern Greek, Hebrew, and English. Bonfil, Robert (2011). Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures. Jerusalem Studies in Religion and Culture. Brill. The Jews have a place of note in the history of Modern Greek. They were unaffected by Atticism and employed the current colloquial vernacular which they then transcribed in Hebrew letters. The Romaniotes were Jews settled in the Eastern Roman Empire long before its division from its Western counterpart, and they were linguistically assimilated long before leaving the Levant after Hadrian's decree against them and their religion. As a consequence, they spoke Greek, the language of the overwhelming majority of the populace in the beginning of the Byzantine era and that of the Greek √©lite thereafter, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Some communities in Northern Greece and Crete maintained their specific Romaniote practices since these communities were either geographically apart from the Sephardim or had different synagogues, and because their liturgies differed greatly.Zunz, Leopold \\"Ritus. 1859. Eine Beschreibung synagogaler Riten\\". Luzzato, S. D. Introduction to the Mahzor Bene Roma, p. 34. 1966 At the end of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika.The Jewish Museum of Greece, The Jewish Community of Ioannina: The Memory of Artefacts, p. 40 (Booklet). 2017 Literature There is a small amount of literature in Yevanic dating from the early part of the modern period, the most extensive document being a translation of the Pentateuch. A polyglot edition of the Bible published in Constantinople in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino (Judaeo- Spanish) translation on one side and a Yevanic translation on the other.Natalio Fernandez Marcos, The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Versions of the Bible (2000) p 180. The Greek text is published in D. C. Hesseling, Les cinq livres de la Loi (1897). In its context, this exceptional cultivation of the vernacular has its analogue in the choice of Hellenistic Greek by the translators of the Septuagint and in the New Testament.Lockwood, W.

It is the only member of the genus Merganetta. It is placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae after the \\"perching duck\\" assemblage where it was formerly assigned to was dissolved because it turned out to be paraphyletic. This long species is a resident breeder in the Andes of South America, nesting in small waterside caves and other sheltered spots. Like the blue duck, it holds territories on fast flowing mountain rivers, usually above . It is a powerful swimmer and diver even in white water, but is reluctant to fly more than short distances. It is not particularly wary when located. Male torrent ducks have a striking black and white head and neck pattern and a red bill. In flight they show dark wings with a green speculum. Females of all subspecies are somewhat smaller than the drakes; they have orange underparts and throat, with the head and upperparts grey and a yellower bill. Juveniles are pale grey above and whitish below. The male's call is a shrill whistle, while the female's is a throatier whistle. This is a declining species due to competition for its invertebrate food from introduced trout, pollution, forest destruction, and damming of mountain rivers for hydroelectric schemes. The Chilean population seems to be relatively stable, while the more northern ones are more seriously affected. However, the overall population is still large enough to warrant classification as a Species of Least Concern in the IUCN Redlist. Subspecies The subspecies taxonomy can be confusing. Males of the southern nominate subspecies M. a. armata, the Chilean torrent duck, have grey back and blackish underparts, with a chestnut belly. Males of the slightly smaller northern subspecies, the Colombian torrent duck, M. a. colombiana, are paler underneath, with streaked grey-brown underparts. Males of a third subspecies, the Peruvian torrent duck, M. a. leucogenis, are intermediate but very variable in plumage; some have entirely black underparts (turneri morph). Only males of the Chilean torrent duck have a black 'teardrop' mark beneath the eye. The Peruvian torrent duck is sometimes split into 4 subspecies (leucogenis, turneri, garleppi and berlepschi), but these are more likely simply color variations, as they are not limited to distinct areas.

The banjo and cuatro are iconic Lucian folk instruments, especially a four- stringed banjo called the bwa poye. Celebratory songs called jw√© show lyricism, and rhythmic complexity. The most important of the Afro-Lucian Creole folk dances is the kwadril. Music is an integral part of Lucian folk holidays and celebrations, as well as the good-natured rivalry between the La Rose and La Marguerite societies. There is little Western classical music on Saint Lucia, and the country's popular music industry is only nascent. There are few recording opportunities, though live music and radio remain a vital part of Lucian culture. Popular music from abroad, especially Trinidadian styles like calypso and soca, is widespread.''' Music education has long been a part of Lucian public education in the primary school age groups. More recently, it has been introduced to older students, many of whom now participate in String Orchestras, wind ensembles, steelpan bands and other musical enrichment opportunities. There is also a well-known government assisted non-profit music school, the Saint Lucia School of Music. The Ministry of Education sponsors a variety of festivals and other special events. The island is also home to the prestigious Saint Lucia Jazz Festival and the Creole celebration Jounen Kw√©y√≤l. Saint Lucia, is an island in the Lesser Antilles of the Caribbean. St.Lucional flower is the rose.  Folk music  A typical Saint Lucian folk band is based around the fiddle, cuatro, banjo, guitar and chak-chak (a rattle). The banjo and cuatro are regarded as particularly important in Saint Lucian culture, especially the small, four- stringed bwa poye, or skroud banjo. Saint Lucian dances include moulala, faci and comette (a derivative of the minuet); however, the kwadril is increasingly viewed as a national symbol. It is a highly stylized and formalized dance that derives from the European quadrille. Jw√© is a more informal form of Lucian folk music, and is performed at dances, wakes and other social events; performers improvise comedic and often biting or lyrics. Music also plays a role in the La Rose and La Marguerite tradition of two rival societies that compete in celebration and form a fundamental part of Lucian culture. Jw√© (play) is a form of rural Lucian folk music associated with beach parties, wakes, d√©b√≤t dances and full moon gatherings. Jw√© is performed as an informal, social event that provide the chance for Lucians to show off their verbal skills, and communicate their comedic, social and political commentaries without offending people. Jw√© includes both songs for men and women, both of which can be singers, though most Lucian folk instrumentalists are male. A jw√© performance is considered good if the audience participates enthusiastically by clapping, responding to the leader and singing and dancing. Some Lucians avoid jw√© altogether because of its sexually raunchy lyricism and atmosphere; nevertheless, elements of jw√© have entered mainstream Lucian culture, such as the use of lang d√©viv√©, or saying the opposite of what is meant. Musical elements of jw√© include g√©m (game song), listwa (storytelling), jw√© chant√© (sung songs) and jw√© dans√© (song-play-dance). These forms are united by their use of the Creole language, their use of call-and-response singing between a leader and a chorus, with the exception of listwa, and the use of improvisation. Jw√© chant√© and listwa are purely vocal styles with no accompaniment, nor any traditional dance; the other two are typically accompanied by a ka drum or sometimes the tibwa percussion sticks, which provides a rhythm for dancers. cited in Guilbault Sung jw√©, jw√© chant√© or chant√© kont, is mostly part of the funeral wake tradition. A jw√© chant√© leader uses pantomime to enact scenes from a story, or sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The g√©m (game song) are based around a leader who uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. Jw√© dans√© includes four traditional dances. The solo is a couple dance, and the d√©b√≤t, yonb√≤t and jw√© p√≤t√© are all circle dances. The bl√≤tj√© is a musical movement found in all jw√© dans√© styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the d√©b√≤t dance. = Kwadril = Quadrille is a Lucian Creole folk dance derived from the European quadrille. It is performed primarily at private parties which are organized by a host in a private home or rented hall, with musicians paid by the host. Kwadrils are held throughout the year, except during Lent. The modern kwadril has declined in popularity; it had come to be seen as a symbol of colonialism around the time of independence, and was shunned as old-fashioned and out-of- date. More recently, some aspects of Lucian society have come to promote the quadrille as a symbol of Lucian culture. Quadrilles are unlike other Lucian dances in that they must be memorized and choreographed, with only slight room for personal interpretation and improvisation. Learners act as a sort of apprentice for more established performers. A successful performance brings respect and prestige for all participants who dance the correct steps which are traditionally said to \\"demonstrate control over behavior, manner, and skills\\" and \\"symbolize... a set of special values linked with a higher social class\\". Kwadril music is provided by an ensemble consisting of a four-stringed instrument, the cuatro (instrument), a rattle, the chakchak, bones called zo, a violin, banjo (skroud, bwa p√≤y√©), mandolin and guitar. A kwadril consists of five separate dances: the pw√©my√© fidji, d√©zy√®m fidji, twazy√®m fidji, katwiy√®m fidji (also avantwa or lanmen dw√®t) and gwan won (also grande rond). The musicians may also use a lakonm√®t (mazurka), schottische or polka; the lakonm√®t, also called the mazouk, is especially popular and is the only closed couple dance which originated in Saint Lucia. = La Rose and La Marguerite = La Rose and La Marguerite are rival societies that commemorate the Anglo- French heritage of the island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies date back to the early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and have a number of positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seated chorus with a leader, the chantw√®l, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper). The celebrations of both groups differ in that La Rose, the \\"English\\" faction, is characterized by noisiness, movement, participation, rhythm and exuberance, while La Marguerite, the \\"French\\" faction, is characterized by melody, discipline and restraint. There is a vibrant tradition of women singing factional songs related to this rivalry. Traditions common to both factions include the Omans, a sort of waltz, Marches and the duple rhythm manpa (or maynan) dance. Kwadril and lakonm√®t are also performed by La Rose. = Other traditional styles = In addition to jw√© and other music performed for entertainment, Saint Lucia is also home to styles used only for specific occasions. These include work songs, drinking songs, funereal music and serenades and masquerades. The latter two traditions are nearly extinct in modern Saint Lucia. The masquerade was a celebration held near holidays like Easter and New Year's Day, which included an orchestra consisting of a tanbou tenbal, chakchak and a bamboo flute. This same ensemble also traditionally performs for cockfights, merry-go-rounds and vocal serenades, called s√©winal in Lucian Creole. The most widespread form of Lucian work song is the chant√© siay, which accompanies the sawing of wood. The vocals are performed by a lead singer and two responding singers, accompanied by a ka and tibwa duo. Both instruments are played in an atypical manner. The ka drum is played on the ground rather than upright, and the tibwa percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than the rim of a drum. Lucian drinking songs are the chant√© abw√®, which are rarely performed in recent years. Their traditional context, however, is the wib√≤t celebration, held during Christmas time. Chant√© abw√® are performed in a game in which the singers, seated at a long table, take turns singing a new song each time their turn comes. Those who lasted the entire evening won prizes, often a bottle of rum. =B√®l√®= The b√©l√® tradition is a form of Creole song and couple dance, performed one couple with a leader and chorus. They are performed in several contexts, most notably in funeral wakes. B√©l√® include the b√©l√® anl√®, b√©l√® matj√©, b√©l√® anlawis and the b√©l√® at√®. The b√©l√® anlawis is the only form which is not responsorial.  Funeral music  On Saint Lucia, wakes are held on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in contrast to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed both inside and outside of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the d√©b√≤t and b√©l√®, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka. Location of Laborie, a village known for the koutoumba tradition The villages of La Grace, Piaye and Laborie in the southwest area of Saint Lucia were known for a unique song-dance called the koutoumba. The koutoumba was only performed for the death of a djin√©, a person descended from Africans who came to the island in the middle of the 19th century. The koutoumba is unique among Lucian folk dance in that it is performed by a sole dancer and using only two to four lines of text, which is evocative of the song's atmosphere rather than narrative. The last drummer who knew this tradition died in 1986.  K√©l√©  K√©l√© is an Afro-Lucian religious tradition from the Djin√© people of the Babonneau region. Only one family, from Resina, in modern Saint Lucia claims to have the religious authority to perform and pass on the k√©l√© rituals. K√©l√© is based around three deities, Eshu, Shango and Ogun, and is similar to the Nigerian Ogun festival. cited in Guilbault, pp 450 K√©l√©'s rituals involve contacting one's ancestors to ask for protection, especially \\"good crops, good health, and good fortune\\". K√©l√© has been underground for much of its history, and was only accepted by the Lucian Roman Catholic Church in the early 1960s. K√©l√© rituals are accompanied by the drumming of the tanbou manman (mother drum) and the tanbou ich (child drum), which play four different rhythms at specified moments; these are the adan, √®r√®, koudou and k√®r√© rhythms. K√©l√© rituals also include singing and dance, as well as feasting, praying to Ogun and the other gods, the smashing of the calabash to appease Eshu at the end of the ceremony, the display of tools made of iron and steel to honor Ogun, and smooth stones to represent Shango, who also receives a ceremonially cleansed sacrificial ram.  Popular music  Lucian popular music can be traced back to the 1940s, when calypso became a part of the island's musical culture. Calypso is a lyrical Trinidadian genre, related to several styles found through the Antillean music area. Music scholar Jocelyne Guilbault has called calypso the primary way modern Lucians \\"express social commentary\\". Along with calypso, Lucia has also imported the Trinidadian steelband and soca traditions. Some Lucian calypsonians recorded in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played an increasing number of programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue. Modern Saint Lucia has produced a few popular musicians in various styles, but is most closely associated with calypso music. Popular Lucian musicians include Tru Tones, Rameau Poleon, Prolifik, Disturbing Joan and Aimran Simmons. Marie Selipha Sesenne Descartes (known simply as \\"Sesenne\\") was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her work as a chantwelle and in the promotion of Saint Lucian traditional culture and music. Saint Lucian folk dance and theater includes flower dances, masquerades and the Papa Djab festival; various kinds of music are associated with these celebrations. = Roots revival = In 1969, three Saint Lucians (Eric Brandford, Primrose Bledman and Charles Cadet) collected numerous folk songs for a presentation at the 1969 Expo in Grenada and then again at Guyana's 1973 Carifesta. Two major folk groups emerged; they were The Helenites (led by Clement Springer) and Joyce Auguste's The Hewanorra Voices. Auguste later introduced folk music into Saint Lucian music education. By the end of the 1980s, music and other aspects of Lucian culture was an integral part of the Lucian education system. In the time leading up to independence from the United Kingdom in 1979, Saint Lucia underwent a profound political and cultural awakening and roots revival which drew on the rise of the black consciousness movement of the United States, the influence of the Caribbean Ecumenical Consultation for Development on local culture and the loosening of restrictions from the powerful Roman Catholic Church on non-Christian cultural elements. Since 1973, the non-government organization Folk Research Centre which seeks to \\"promote research into St. Lucian culture\\" and to \\"explore and clarify the role of culture in the development of our people\\". =Bouyon soca= Bouyon soca typically blends old bouyon music rhythms from the 90s' and soca music. In recent years Bouyon soca has become popular in the island of Saint Lucia. Saint Lucian artist Ricky T released a song \\"Pressure boom\\" in 2007 which blended the two genres and became very popular throughout the English speaking Caribbean. This style of bouyon is mostly, but not exclusively, produced in Saint Lucia.  Government and industry  The government has seen value in promoting a music industry, and has formed the Cultural Development Foundation (CDF) the statutory body given responsibility for preservation and promotion of Saint Lucian culture and arts, to accomplish this goal. In 1979, the first-ever M&C; Fine Arts Awards were given by Minvielle & Chastanet Ltd, to Saint Lucian artists as an Independence Gift to the Nation; in the early 2000s, this event was handed over to the newly formed Cultural Development Foundation and is now run as the National Arts Festival. The Folk Research Centre has been a prominent part of Lucian cultural research since 1973, and has also published the journal Lucian Kaiso, devoted to Lucian calypso, since 1990. The island's calypso traditions are also celebrated at the annual kaiposium (a kaiso symposium), held since 1987. The island's music industry remains little-known internationally and of small economic importance. The government of Saint Lucia has worked with the OECS to promote the regional music industry through intellectual property law and sponsoring festivals and other activities. Saint Lucia Jazz Festival in Castries The most important festival in modern Lucian culture is the Jounen Kw√©y√≤l (International Creole Day) held annually on October 28 since 1983. The Jounen Kw√©y√≤l is sponsored by the Bannzil Kw√©y√≤l, an international organization. Lucian activities are run by the Folk Research Centre in conjunction with the National Research and Development Foundation and the Mouvman Kw√©y√≤l Sent Lisi (St. Lucia Creole Movement). Lucian law protects the owners of intellectual property, such as songwriters, through the Copyright Act of 1995; copyrights are administered by the Hewanorra Musical Society. There is also a Saint Lucia Jazz Festival that is a major attraction, and a well-known part of the local music scene. It has been an annual event for fifteen years, and has hosted a variety of jazz stars, in addition to local talent. The 2005 festival was a boost for the local music industry, netting $46 million. The Festival is sponsored by a number of corporations and groups, perhaps most significantly BET.  Education  Music is a part of the curriculum at public schools in Saint Lucia; it has long been taught in younger grade levels, but was only introduced to secondary education in 1999. Primary education on Saint Lucia, music and other artistic education is commonly used incidentally to teaching other subjects or for special occasions. About 40% of the island's schools engage in general music education, while others spent more time on general group singing or choir, or recorder ensemble performance. In 2003, a string program was instituted for primary students. Location of the Education Centre at Anse La Raye About 70% of schools teach music at the lower secondary level. Many of the schools that do not normally instruct in music may offer volunteer clubs or other more informal opportunities for musical enrichment. Many Lucian schools have formed ensembles, most commonly a wind ensemble (30% of schools), or a steelpan band (20%) or combo group (20%). The public education field has also collaborated with the Saint Lucia School of Music to form the National Youth Choir, String Orchestra and Secondary Schools Wind Ensemble. The governmental Ministry of Education also sponsors a number of festivals and musical special events, both for the benefit of all students and the enrichment of the musically-gifted among them. The Saint Lucia School of Music is an independent institute of music education that has two branches on the island, one in the north and one in the south. It was established in 1987, and has a student body of around four hundred students. The School's professed goal is to provide music education at all levels, to offer community opportunities for musical enrichment, to facilitate the training and professional development of educators, and to establish the school as a musical resource. There is also a notable music Education Centre operated by a vocal group from the fishing village Anse la Raye; this Centre provides music education opportunities for gifted and underprivileged children from across the island.

Work began in 2013 to expand the museum according to international standards, with a large adjoining garden for visitors to relax and walk around. Collections Ivory carving from Kapissa, capital of the Kushan Empire, 1st to 2nd Century AD. Many treasures of ivory are stored there, as are antiquities from Kushan, early Buddhism, and early Islam. One of the most famous pieces in the museum, and known to have survived the turbulent period in the 1990s is the Rabatak Inscription of King Kanishka. =Archaeological Materials= As the National Museum Kabul has been the repository for many of the most spectacular archaeological finds in the country. These include the painted frescos from Dilberjin; inscriptions, fragments of architecture, sculpture, metal objects, and coins rescued from the French excavations at Ai-Khanoum and Surkh Kotal; the spectacular collection of objects found at a merchants warehouse in the city of Bagram, which include ivories from India, mirrors from China, and glassware from the Roman Empire; the stucco heads of Hadda; Buddhist sculpture from Tepe Sardar and other monastic institutions in Afghanistan; and a large collection of Islamic art from the Ghazvanid and Timurid periods found at Ghazni.Tissot, F (2006) Catalogue of the National Museum of Afghanistan 1931-1985, UNESCO Publishing =Numismatic Collection= The National Museum has a large collection of coins, the Austrian numismatist Robert G√∂bl reported it contained 30,000 objects during a UNESCO sponsored audit of the collection. It is unknown how much the collection has grown since or what was lost during the various wars since. The collection contains the bulk of archaeological material recovered in Afghanistan. It has not been published, but individual hoards and archaeological sites have been. The French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA) published the coin finds made at the town of Surkh Kotal. Some of the coins found at the excavation of Begram have been published.Ghrishman, 1946 Part of the Mir Zakah hoard, a very unusual deposit containing enormous numbers of coins from the fourth century BC to third century AD, totalling 11,500 silver and copper coins were kept in the museum.

The last week in June features the St Kitts Music Festival, while the week-long Culturama on Nevis lasts from the end of July into early August.Cameron, pg. 502 In addition, there are other festivals on the island of Saint Kitts. There is Inner City Fest in February in Molineaux Green Valley Festival usually around Whit Monday in the village of Cayon, Easterama around Easter (April) in the village of Sandy Point, Fest-Tab, around July-August in the village of Tabernacle, and La festival de Capisterre, around Independence Day in Saint Kitts and Nevis (19 September), in the Capisterre region. These celebrations typically feature parades, street dances and salsa, jazz, soca, calypso and steelpan music. Traditional music The most well-known kind of traditional music is probably seasonal Christmas songs, though there also chanteys and other songs. Music is also a part of the Tea Meetings which are common on the island, featuring a pair of stentorian male singers in a competitive kind of performance in which hecklers play an important role.Musical Traditions Carnival music Carnival in Saint Kitts and Nevis features music quite prominently. Big Drum and string bands accompany folk performers. Other instruments include shack-shack (a tin can with beads inside), baha (a blown metal pipe), triangle, fife, guitar and quarto. Iron bands were introduced to Saint Kitts and Nevis' Carnival in the 1940s, when bands used makeshift percussion instruments from the likes of car rims. Ensembles of local, collaborative musicians formed during this era, playing drums, saxophones, bass guitars and trumpets; these included the Silver Rhythm Orchestra, Brown Queen, Music Makers, Esperanza and Rhythm Kings. The following decade saw the introduction a Trinidadian style called steelpan, brought by Lloyd Matheson, C.B.E., then an Education Officer. The first steelpan band was Roy Martin's Wilberforce Steel Pan. Other bands included the Eagle Squadron, Boomerang, Casablanca, Boston Tigers and The Invaders. Modern Carnival in Saint Kitts and Nevis did not begin until the late 1950s. In the 1960s, brass bands dominated first Carnival, then much of popular music.SKNVibes Carnival History  Calypso  Calypso is a style of music from Trinidad and Tobago, consisting of highly lyrical songs that frequently makes topical comments on the ruling classes and social issues of the day. During slavery, calypso was used for commentary against the oppression and brutal treatment suffered by the slaves at the hands of their masters. This form was called Caiso (Ka-ee-sow) meaning \\"the town cry\\", while the singer/composer was called the \\"Caisonian\\". This singing was then nicknamed \\"calypso\\" by the European slave masters, who called it after the mythological sea nymph calypso because of its melodic ability to captivate its listeners. The caisonians were then pressured by their masters to sing songs to entertain them in return for certain privileges and an ease of tasks, and for money during the post-emancipation period. Calypso was subsequently commercialized in Trinidad, where it was sung mainly for entertainment in shows called \\"calypso tents\\" during the Trinidad carnival celebrations. (Unreferenced) From Trinidad, calypso spread across the Caribbean, and became a major part of Kittitian (or Kittian) and Nevisian music with the introduction of formal calypso competitions in the 1950s. Prominent early calypsonians from this period included Mighty Kush, Lord Mike, Elmo Osborne, Lord Harmony, King Monow and the Mighty Saint. By the 1980s, calypso had begun to peak in popularity on Saint Kitts and Nevis, while the two dominant performers were the rivals Starshield and Ellie Matt ] ] (King Richie and son King 'Richie Buntin'.who today are one of the most prolific songwriter and composers. .SKNVibes Calypso See also * Culture of St. Kitts and Nevis In Nevis, the emerging calypsonians in the 80's were Mighty Chevi, Bahowlah the Meek, King Meko, Chaplet and Ginger who made professional recordings to boost Nevis Culturama, the local festivel.

An American column marched from Fort George and attempted to surprise a British outpost at Beaver Dams, billeting themselves overnight in the village of Queenston, Ontario. Laura Secord, a resident of Queenston, had earlier learned of the American plans, and had struck out on a long and difficult trek to warn the British at Decou's stone house near present-day Brock University. When the Americans resumed their march, they were ambushed by Native warriors and eventually surrendered to a small British detachment led by Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. About 500 Americans, including their wounded commander, were taken prisoner. Background On 25 May 1813, the Americans had won the Battle of Fort George, capturing the fort. The British fell back to a position at Burlington Heights near the western end of Lake Ontario, briefly abandoning the entire Niagara Peninsula to the Americans. The Americans attempted to pursue the British, but their advance was checked at the Battle of Stoney Creek by a British counter-attack. At the same time, the American flotilla of warships which had been supporting their army on the Niagara Peninsula was hastily withdrawn to face a threat to their own base, and a British flotilla threatened the Americans' line of communications.Hitsman, p.151 The Americans fell back to Fort George. The British followed up and established an outpost at DeCou's house in the present-day city of Thorold, Ontario, from which Natives and militia harassed American outposts.S.A. Curzon, Laura Secord, in Zaslow (ed), p.307 The American commander at Fort George, Brigadier General John Parker Boyd, decided to clear the threat posed by enemy raiders and to restore his men's morale by making a surprise attack on the outpost at DeCou's.Elting, p.132 American plan The American force assigned to the attack was led by the recently promoted Colonel Charles Boerstler of the 14th U.S. Infantry and consisted of Boerstler's own 14th U.S. Regiment of Infantry, with detachments of the 6th, 13th and 23rd U.S. Regiments of Infantry, a company of artillery with one 12-pounder and one 6-pounder field guns, and twenty U.S. Dragoons. An irregular corps of forty mounted volunteers from the New York Militia under Cyrenius Chapin led the way.Michael Betti, Township of Thorold, 1793-1967 : Centennial Project of the Township of Thorold, pg.47 The force was accompanied by two large supply wagons. At dusk on 23 June, Boerstler's force moved in secret from Fort George to the village of Queenston, where they quartered themselves in the houses and other buildings. Laura Secord escorted to the British outpost by Mohawk warriors. Several American officers had earlier billeted themselves in the house of Militia Captain James Secord, who had been severely wounded the previous year at the Battle of Queenston Heights. His wife, Laura Secord, overheard the American officers discussing their scheme. Very early on 22 June,Michael Betti, Township of Thorold, 1793-1967 : Centennial Project of the Township of Thorold, pg.43 she set out to warn the British at DeCou's house, walking about , Laura Secord Trek through the woods until she came upon a Native encampment on the Twelve Mile Creek. The warriors took her to Lieutenant James FitzGibbon, who commanded the British outpost. The information she conveyed to FitzGibbon confirmed what Natives had reported since they first observed the American column near St. David's. Battle The main contingent of Natives were 300 Kahnawake, also referred to as Caughnawaga in contemporary accounts. (The Kahnawake were Mohawks who had earlier been converted to Christianity by Jesuit missionaries.) They were nominally commanded by Captain Dominique Ducharme of the Indian Department, with Lieutenants Isaac LeClair and J.B. de Lorimier. There were also 100 Mohawks under Captain William Johnson Kerr. They set up ambushes in a thickly wooded area east of Beaver Dams. FitzGibbon with 46 men of the 49th Regiment of Foot was in reserve. Lt. James FitzGibbon led 46 regulars of the 49th Regiment of Foot during the battle. Early on 24 June, the Americans set out for DeCou's stone house. At St. David's they proceeded along a trail at the base of the escarpment until they reached another trail leading up the \\"mountain\\". Reaching the top, they became aware of Natives closing in on their flanks and rear. Boerstler did not change his plans. When the Natives opened fire, Boerstler was wounded and placed in one of the wagons. According to American accounts,Elting, p.133 they caused the Mohawks to flee and fought their way out of the woods into open fields where they could use their artillery, and the Natives were not at such an advantage. This account is not supported by other witnesses. At this point, FitzGibbon intervened. Addressing Boerstler under a flag of truce, he claimed that the Americans were outnumbered and surrounded, and that if they did not surrender he would be unable to restrain the natives from slaughtering the entire American force. The wounded Boerstler capitulated to Major de Haren of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry, who had just arrived on the field with another detachment of British regulars (mainly from the 104th Regiment) from Twelve Mile Creek.Hitsman, pp.151, 155 The American force surrendered in a field just south of the Thorold Tunnel, east of the present day Welland Canal. The prisoners were escorted first to DeCou's, then to the British base at Ball's Falls.. Casualties The natives admitted to a total of five chiefs and warriors killed, and 20 wounded, although Ducharme stated that 15 were killed and 25 wounded. The American casualty report stated 25 killed and 50 wounded; all of the wounded being among the prisoners, who numbered 23 officers and 489 enlisted men. It was later claimed that many of the wounded Americans were killed by Mohawks. Results The loss of Boerstler's detachment demoralized the Americans at Fort George. From then until they abandoned the fort on 10 December, they rarely dared send any patrols more than a mile from the fort. To reinforce their fear of the Native people, there was another minor disaster on 8 July when a party from the 8th (King's) Regiment and Merritt's Troop of Provincial Dragoons, accompanied by Ottawas under Captain Matthew Elliott and other Indigenous warriors under Mohawk chief John Norton, went to retrieve a chest of medicines which had been hastily buried at Ball's Farm near Two Mile Creek when the British had evacuated Fort George in May. An American party from the 13th U.S. Infantry under Lieutenant Joseph Eldridge attempted to pursue the British detachment but was ambushed, losing 28 men, several of whom were scalped despite the efforts of officers of the Indian Department to prevent it.Stanley, George F.G. The Indians in the War of 1812, in Zaslow (ed) p. 183 Most of the American regular soldiers and Boyd himself were transferred from Fort George to Sackett's Harbor in September, leaving the fort in the hands of New York Militia. Legends and folk tales Referring to the respective parts played by the various Native Americans and the British, local legend (perhaps started by Mohawk leader John Norton, who was present) had it that, \\"The Caughnawaga got the victory, the Mohawks got the plunder and FitzGibbon got the credit\\".The quote has also been ascribed to William Hamilton Merritt in Hitsman, p.335 endnote In 1818, FitzGibbon made a report to Captain Kerr which read in part: > With respect to the affair with Captain (sic) Boerstler, not a shot was > fired on our side by any but the Indians. They beat the American detachment > into a state of terror, and the only share I claim is taking advantage of a > favorable moment to offer them protection from the tomahawk and scalping > knife. The Indian Department did the rest. Captain Ducharme claimed that he himself did not demand the Americans' surrender because as a French Canadian by birth who had spent most of his life among the Indians, he spoke no English. =Laura Secord= Twelve Mile Creek, in her effort to alert the British detachment on 23 June 1813. Much later, in 1827, FitzGibbon wrote: > I do hereby Certify that on the 22d. day of June 1813, Mrs. Secord, Wife of > James Secord, Esqr. then of St. David's, came to me at the Beaver Dam after > Sun Set, having come from her house at St. David's by a circuitous route a > distance of twelve miles, and informed me that her Husband had learnt from > an American officer the preceding night that a Detachment from the American > Army then in Fort George would be sent out on the following morning (the > 23d.) for the purpose of Surprising and capturing a Detachment of the 49th > Regt. then at Beaver Dam under my Command.

Folk music  Montserrat's folk musical heritage includes a wide array of religious and ritual folk music. There are also folk songs used in spiritual musical traditions, in addition to secular use; indeed, there is little distinction between secular and spiritual aspects of traditional Montserratian culture. Folk songs are generally in the Montserrat Creole language and concern topics ranging from obeah (magic) to agriculture, infidelity and historic occurrences.Montserrat Chamber of Commerce Many songs are widespread and well-known, and occur in numerous variations, including \\"Nincom Riley\\" and \\"All de Relief\\", two of the most famous Montserratian folk songs. The folk repertoire also include calypsos and Irish melodies. The Irish Montserratian tradition has largely died out, with the last performer, George Allen, a fiddler, dying in 1966. = Jumbie = The jumbie dance has been called the \\"purest manifestation of folk religion on Montserrat\\",Chamber of Commerce. and is an iconic part of folk culture, bringing together local folklore, dance, song and music.Messenger, p. 924. It has also been described as a startling and unique hybrid, consisting of \\"Western instruments (that) produce Africanesque music, to which dancers perform Irish steps while moving their upper bodies like Africans\\".Messenger, p. 925. The jumbie dance was probably last performed in 1980. Jumbies are traditionally said to be spirits, one of several kinds that also include the African sukra and jabless, and the Irish mermaid, animal spirit (similar to the P√∫ca) and the Jack Lantern. Jumbies hold a similar place in Montserratian society as fairies does in Irish culture; they are the recipients of many small offerings, such as bits of food or drink, and the subject of numerous daily superstitions and rituals. The jumbie dance is performed by four couples, one man and one woman. They each do a series of sets, consisting of five quadrilles played at successively swifter tempos. The couples will switch out as they get tired, until eventually one becomes possessed by a jumbie. They often move about wildly, fall to the floor and shout in glossolalia. Some Montserratian Irish trace the origins of the jumbie dance to the pre-emancipation period, when slaves attempted to perform the dances performed by white overseers and landowners. Jumbie dances are traditionally performed after a celebration, in the home of a sponsor, and to mark times of individual crisis or major life changes, such as a wedding or christening. The jumbie dance is said to induce spiritual possession and grant divination skills. Often, jumbie dances are intended to cure diseases, remove curses or discover the identity of a guilty party. There are generally three jumbie dancers in a unit, who perform accompanied by the babala (tambourine, or jumbie drum), triangle, fife or pulley (accordion, concertina or melodeon), and most importantly the French reel (also jumbie drum or woowoo), a skin drum that produces an ominous sound which is said to attract the jumbie spirits.The Chamber of Commerce and John Messenger mostly agree; the Chamber of Commerce does not mention the triangle, and refers to the tambourine/bambala as the jumbie drum, while Messenger reserves this for the French reel or woowoo. Both the babala and French reel are similar to the Irish bodhran in construction; all three drums are played with the fingertips, palms and the backs of the hands. = Other folk traditions = The same music used in the jumbie dance also accompanies country dances (also known as goatskin or drum dance). Country dances are strictly recreational, however, and use different songs and dances than the jumbie dance. Rum shops are frequently home to string bands, especially on Boxing Day, and ensembles of guitar, banjo, accordion and cuatro (ukulele). The Montserratian tradition of masquerading is both a ritual and celebratory element of folk music. Groups of dancers (masqueraders) with bright costumes and voluminous adornments, including whips (hunters) that are used for the Masqueraders to move crowds away as they parade the streets, scare away evil spirits and send signals to other dancers. Masqueraders travel door to door and receive small gifts, while dancing a standard set of dances consisting of a heel-and-toe polka and five quadrilles. This celebration begins in mid-December and ends January 1. Montserrat is also home to a string band folk tradition that provides accompaniment to many kinds of songs and dances. These generally include the ukulele (yokolee, imported from Hawaiian music), guitar, triangle, the bass boom pipe, shak-shak, gradge and fife. String bands traditionally performed for weddings; this tradition declined with the rise of stereos and recorded music, as well as the spread of jazz bands, but was revived in the 1970s. String bands now also play at hotels and nightclubs.  Popular music and modern styles  The steel band tradition is common to many Caribbean, and especially Lesser Antillean, islands. The Montserratian tradition began in 1949 in Ryner's Village and Kinsale, and was prominent enough by the following year to be played at the Empire Day celebrations. Despite some criticism that the music was degrading for children, steel bands have become a major part of the island's musical heritage. Calypso is an originally Trinidadian style of music that has since spread across the world. In recent years it has become a major part of Montserratian music, with the rise of Alphonsus \\"Arrow\\" Cassell, a soca artist who is internationally renowned. Calypso in Montserrat dates to the 1950s, and Justin \\"Hero\\" Cassell (Arrow's brother), who won the islands calypso competition thirteen times and became the Calypso King of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States. In 2000, Sylvina \\"Khandie\\" Malone became the first female calypso monarch on Montserrat. A popular song on local radio is \\"Sailing Away Again\\" by local writer and singer Eloise Lynch. Her main focus is Lovers Rock but this song has always been a popular favorite on the island. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z84Zc_YHnps  Holidays and festivals  The Montserrat December Festival (the local Carnival tradition) is the biggest holiday of the year, held all through the month of December concluding on January 1 and ending with a street parade. The Festival is like Carnival on the other Caribbean islands, featuring competitions in various skills, especially the Calypso King competition, street dancing (jamming or jumping up), Soca King, beauty pageants and masquerade performances. There are also Christmas songs and caroling. December Festival parades formerly included music and masqueraders, and dancers in uniforms modeled on the Grenadier Guards. Music is provided by an ensemble of triangle, fife and two goatskin, deep-barreled drums called kettles or booms). This tradition is primarily African in style, with little Irish or British influence, and is very distinct from jumbie dance styles. The traditional music of the December Festival was last performed in 1988, in St. John's Village. Boxing Day is an occasion for music competitions, held in Sturge Park. Steelbands, village groups, masquerade ensembles and mummers all perform. Jump-up Day commemorates and celebrates emancipation from slavery, and is accompanied by steelbands, masquerades and dancing men carrying chains to symbolize the bondage of slavery. Music is also an important part of St Patrick's Day, which is a celebration of Montserrat's Irish heritage and music and has now been transformed into a whole week of activities.  Music for Montserrat  Air Studios, a recording studio operated by George Martin, used to be on the island, and performers like the Rolling Stones, Sting and Elton John traveled there to record. After Hurricane Hugo, however, the studios were closed. Martin organized a fundraiser (Music for Montserrat) for the island in 1997, which included native band Arrow, Mark Knopfler, Jimmy Buffett, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Carl Perkins (who died the next year), Sting and Elton John. Other local bands performed simultaneously at Gerald's Bottom on the island; the occasion also saw the reformation of Climax Blues Band and the appearance of Bankie Banks.

The ship was named after the Tone River, in the Kant≈ç region of Japan and was completed on 20 November 1938 at Mitsubishi's Nagasaki shipyards. Tone was designed for long-range scouting missions and had a large seaplane capacity. She was extensively employed during World War II usually providing scouting services to their aircraft carrier task forces. She almost always operated in this capacity in conjunction with her sister ship . World War II =Early Pacific War= At the end of 1941, Tone was assigned to CruDiv 8 with her sister ship, Chikuma, and was thus present during the attack on Pearl Harbor. That day, 7 December 1941, Tone and Chikuma each launched one Aichi E13A1 \\"Jake\\" floatplane for a final weather reconnaissance over Oahu. At 0630, Tone and Chikuma each launched short-range Nakajima E4N2 Type 90-2 Reconnaissance Seaplane to act as pickets and patrol south of the Striking Force. Tones floatplane flew to Lahaina, but found no American fleet units present. During the subsequent attack, the battleships , , and were sunk and , , , and many smaller ships were damaged. Hiei. On 16 December, CruDiv 8 was ordered to assist in the second attempted invasion of Wake Island. Tone launched two Nakajima E8N \\"Daves\\" for anti-submarine patrols. After the fall of Wake Island, CruDiv 8 returned to Kure, Hiroshima. By 14 January 1942, CruDiv 8 was based out of Truk in the Caroline Islands, and covered the landings of Japanese troops at Rabaul, New Britain as well as attacks on Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea. On 24 January, Tones floatplanes attacked the Admiralty Islands. After 1 February air raid on Kwajalein by Vice Admiral William Halsey, Jr aboard the aircraft carrier , Tone departed Truk with the Carrier Striking Force in an unsuccessful pursuit. Chikuma and Tone later participated in the Raid on Port Darwin, Australia on 19 February, destroying 15 aircraft and sinking 11 ships. Tone launched a floatplane to report in weather conditions prior to the attack, but the plane‚Äôs radio failed and it returned without reporting. Later, another floatplane had greater success, and shot down a PBY Catalina of the RAAF. =Battle of the Java Sea= On 1 March 1942, Tone spotted the old American destroyer , SSE of Christmas Island. Four days later, floatplanes from Tone and Chikuma took part on the strike against Tjilatjap. On 6 March, Tone rescued a British seaman who had been adrift since his ship had been sunk off Java on 27 February. =Indian Ocean Raids= On 5 April 1942, Tone was part of a major task force which launched 315 aircraft against British-held Colombo, Ceylon. The old destroyer , armed merchant cruiser and 27 aircraft were destroyed and over 500 killed in the harbor, while cruisers and were destroyed at sea. Tone and the rest of the task force returned to Japan in mid-April 1942, when it was almost immediately assigned to the unsuccessful pursuit of Admiral Halsey's Task Force 16.2 with the aircraft carrier after the Doolittle Raid. =Battle of Midway= At the crucial Battle of Midway, Tone and CruDiv 8 was part of Vice Admiral Ch≈´ichi Nagumo's Carrier Striking Force. On 4 June, Tone and Chikuma each launched two \\"Jakes\\" to search out for American carriers. Tones floatplane discovered American ships, but owing to internal bureaucracy in their command structure its report was not immediately delivered to Admiral Nagumo. As a result, he had already ordered his aircraft to prepare for another attack on Midway before he received the report. Tone was attacked by enemy carrier aircraft during the battle, but sustained no damage, except the loss of a \\"Dave\\" with its crew. Chikuma and Tone were then detached to support Vice Admiral Boshiro Hosogaya's Aleutian invasion force. However, the anticipated American counter- attack failed to materialize. CruDiv 8 cruised northern waters uneventfully. Rear Admiral Chuichi Hara assumed command of CruDiv 8 from 14 July 1942. With the US invasion of Guadalcanal, Chikuma and Tone were ordered south again on 16 August with the aircraft carriers , , , , and . They were joined by the battleships , , seaplane tender , and cruisers , , , . =Battle of the Eastern Solomons= On 24 August 1942, CruDiv 7's and arrived to join the reinforcement fleet for Guadalcanal. The following morning, a Consolidated PBY Catalina spotted Ry≈´j≈ç, which Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and Grumman TBF Avengers from Enterprise unsuccessfully attacked. Seven floatplanes from Tone and Chikuma were launched to locate the American fleet. One of Chikumas planes spotted the Americans, but was shot down before its report could be relayed. However, a second floatplane was more successful, and the Japanese launched an attack against Enterprise, hitting it with three bombs which set her wooden deck on fire. However, in the meantime, the Americans located the Japanese fleet, and Ry≈´j≈ç was sunk by planes from the carrier . Tone was attacked unsuccessfully by two Avengers whose Mark 13 torpedoes missed, returning to Truk safely. =Battle of Santa Cruz= Through October, Chikuma and Tone patrolled north of the Solomon Islands, awaiting word of recapture of Henderson Field by the Japanese. On 19 October, Tone (with the destroyer ) was detached on an independent mission to scout for American ships. Both ships operated off the Santa Cruz Islands until a Kawanishi H6K \\"Emily\\" from Jaluit Atoll sighted a carrier off the New Hebrides. On 26 October 1942, northeast of Guadalcanal, Rear Admiral Hiroaki Abe's task force launched seven floatplanes to scout south of Guadalcanal. They located the American fleet, and Abe followed with an attack by 13 Nakajima B5N2 \\"Kate\\" torpedo planes which sank the carrier and damaged the battleship and cruiser . However, two of the four aircraft launched by Tone during the attack were shot down. Tone supported Japanese reinforcement efforts at Guadalcanal through mid-November 1942, and was then assigned to patrols from its base in Truk through mid-February 1943. After returning to Maizuru for refit on 21 February, two additional twin-mount Type 96 25-mm AA guns were installed along with a Type 21 air-search radar. On 15 March 1943 Rear Admiral Kishi Fukuji assumed command of CruDiv 8, and Tone was ordered back to Truk. However, on 17 May, Chikuma and Tone were tasked to accompany battleship back to Tokyo for the state funeral of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Tone was back in Truk by 15 July, having avoided numerous submarine attacks along the route. From July to November, Tone was engaged in making troop transport runs to Rabaul, and to patrols of the Marshall Islands in unsuccessful pursuit of the American fleet. While back at Kure on 6 November, Tone gained additional 25-mm AA guns, bringing its total to 20. CruDiv 8 was disbanded on 1 January 1944, and both Tone and Chikuma were reassigned to CruDiv 7 (with Suzuya and Kumano) under Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura. Tone returned to Truk on 2 January. In February, Tone assisted with the evacuation of Japanese forces from Truk to Palau. From 1 March 1944, Tone was assigned to commerce raiding in the Indian Ocean. On 9 March, Tone sank the British freighter SS Behar, taking aboard 108 survivors against orders. Of the survivors, 32 were disembarked as prisoners of war at Batavia. Admiral Naomasa Sakonju aboard the cruiser , ordered that the remaining prisoners be \\"disposed of\\", and they were taken out to sea and beheaded. (Following the war, Sakonju was executed for war crimes, including the murder of these prisoners, while the former commander of Tone, Captain Haruo Mayazumi, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment.) On 20 March 1944, Rear Admiral Kazutaka Shiraishi assumed command of CruDiv 7. =Battle of the Philippine Sea= On 13 June 1944, Admiral Soemu Toyoda activated \\"Operation A-GO\\" for the defense of the Mariana Islands. Tone was assigned to Force \\"C\\" of Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's Mobile Fleet, which proceeded through the Visayan Sea to the Philippine Sea headed towards Saipan. On 20 June, after the battleships , and carrier were attacked by aircraft from the carriers , and and the bulk of the Japanese air cover was destroyed in the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\", Tone retired with the Mobile Fleet to Okinawa, and from there to Kure. While at Kure from 26 June to 8 July 1944, Tone gained additional Type 96 25-mm AA, bringing its total to 57. Two new Type 22 surface-search radars and a Type 13 air-search radar were also fitted. After ferrying army troops to Okinawa, Tone was reassigned back to Singapore in July. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= On 23 October 1944, Tone along with the cruisers Kumano, Suzuya and Chikuma, sortied from Brunei towards the Philippines with Admiral Takeo Kurita's First Mobile Striking Force. The battle group was attacked by submarines while sailing through the Palawan Passage. The cruisers Atago and Maya were sunk, and Takao was damaged. As the force entered the Sibuyan Sea on 24 October, the Center Force suffered eleven raids by aircraft from the carriers of Task Group 38.2. Musashi was sunk and Tone was hit by bombs. The following day during the Battle off Samar, the battleships , , Haruna and the cruiser were damaged. Tone engaged the American destroyer but was driven away by air attack. She escaped back through the San Bernardino Strait without further damage, but Tones sister ship Chikuma was lost, along with the cruisers and Suzuya. =Drydock and use as a training ship= Tone sunk near Kure On 6 November, Tone departed Brunei towards Manila, and onward to Mako in the Pescadores and Kure. Back in dry dock in Maizuru, Tone gained four additional triple-mount 25-mm AA guns aft, bringing its total to 62. The Type 21 radar was replaced with a Type 22. CruDiv 7 was disbanded 21 November and Tone reassigned to CruDiv 5 with Kumano. Once repairs were completed on 18 February 1945, Tone relocated to Etajima, where it was moored for use as a training ship. It was slightly damaged in an air raid on 19 March. =Sinking during the bombing of Kure= On 24 July 1945, Task Force 38 launched a large air raid against Kure aimed at the final destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Nine aircraft from the light carrier Monterey hit Tone with three bombs, causing her to settle to the bottom of the bay. The hulk was attacked again on 28 July by rockets and armor-piercing bombs dropped by planes from the carriers , and . Tone was removed from the Navy List on 20 November 1945. The hulk was raised and scrapped after the war from 1947‚Äì1948.

On the other hand, theories are incommensurable if they are embedded in starkly contrasting conceptual frameworks whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite empirical evidence favoring one theory over the other. Discussed by Ludwik Fleck in the 1930s,Ludwik Fleck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy); Fleck's term for incommensurability was \\"niewsp√≥≈Çmierno≈õƒá\\". and popularized by Thomas Kuhn in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.  Introduction of the term  In 1962, Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases, the concept came from mathematics; in its original sense, it is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two variables, such as the prediction of the diagonal of a square from the relationship of its sides. The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific theories. Its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain theses proposed by followers of the received view of theories. These include the famous thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge, which states that the body of scientific knowledge has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a model that sees both revolutions and periods of normalcy in the history of science. Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a neutral language of comparison which can be used to formulate the empirical consequences of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers‚Äîor the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is Popperian. The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates. Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B ‚Äì and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of rationality. In both cases, the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.  Perspectives  = Feyerabend's perspectives = Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of semantics which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T'. Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of \\"incommensurability,\\"Van Fraassen, Bas. The Empirical Stance. Yale UP: 2002. p. 114.Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene. \\"The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories\\" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. \\"...he had developed his notion of the incommensurability of scientific theories more than ten years prior to the appearance of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)\\" which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to Karl Popper's London School of Economics seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians (Elizabeth Anscombe, Peter Geach, H. L. A. Hart and Georg Henrik von Wright) in Anscombe's Oxford flat. Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus scientific paradigms, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend's notion of incommensurability is as follows: # The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory. # Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge. # Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates. According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in formal logic, because it is a phenomenon outside of logic's domain.  Theories  In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper's critical rationalism whereby \\"investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation.\\" (Feyerabend, 1989; pp. 96). Scientific methodology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T' which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T' answers both questions then T is discarded. That is, a new theory T', in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T, the failures in the old theory, which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F). Given this model it is possible to construct relational statements between certain terms from T and from T', which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T' in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other. However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T' will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of observation will be commensurable. In the same way, if a realist perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given. It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to affirm the relational character of longitude, this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to quantum mechanics (QM) as opposed to classical mechanics (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other. In this same way Feyerabend comments that:  Realist objections  In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an argument elaborated by Carnap and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as \\"...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection.\\" (Feyerabend, pp. 373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term. Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and panrationalism in science. This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared. Feyerabend's answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn't explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial conditions than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks \\"why should it be necessary to have a terminology that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of Aristotle and Newton.\\"  Theory selection  The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position: Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper's arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality \\"a posteriori\\" to the selection. While, Feyerabend's position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper's first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration: Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper's rationality a \\"mere verbal ornament.\\" This does not imply that Feyerabend is an irrationalist but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability. = Kuhn's perspectives = The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is Thomas Kuhn, who introduced it in his 1962 book, The structure of scientific revolutions, in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive paradigms. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn's work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a taxonomic sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world. In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that \\"the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them\\". According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other's point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability: # Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy. # The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network. # The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research. In a postscript (1969) to The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of similarity sets in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one's mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language. Kuhn's thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of Michael Polanyi who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, \\"think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world.\\"  Phases  Given his changing definition of incommensurability P√©rez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn's work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (SSR) and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract: The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies symmetry and transitivity so that if theory T is translatable with theory T', then T' can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T and this can be translated to T', then theories T and T' cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another. Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage: This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn's sense of rationality is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation. In the third stage of Kuhn's work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in taxonomic terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes ‚Äì its intention ‚Äì but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a holistic manner meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.  Taxonomic characterization  Taxonomic characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap principle, since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable ‚Äì they are isomorphic. This characterization was already present in Kuhn's writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.  Reluctance  An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn's writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of philosophy. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn's rejection of his critics, such as Popper and Davidson. However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn's solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn's work suggests four aspects to this question: * Firstly, in order to carry out such an assimilation it is necessary that the complementary vocabulary is easily understood. * Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential. * Thirdly, class concepts cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets. * Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter. = Conclusion = It can be concluded that Kuhn's idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into irrationalism nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as Problems of Empiricism and Against Method that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions. Meta- incommensurability A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways. Eric Oberheim and Paul Hoyningen-Huene argue that realist and anti-realist philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable. Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of meaning. He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend's concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

They had one Top 40 hit, \\"There You Go\\" in 1992, as well as several hits on Canada's modern rock charts, including \\"Trigger\\" and \\"Little Kingdoms\\". The band had a diverse, genre-defying sound, with the songs on their albums crossing from pop to hard rock to something almost akin to punk. History The band was formed in 1982 in Toronto, Ontario by vocalist and guitarist Ian Blurton and bassist Rob Taylor, initially inspired by contemporary punk rock bands such as The Clash, Gang of Four and L'√âtranger. Over the next number of years, Blurton also participated in a number of side projects, working with Jolly Tambourine Man, Cowboy Junkies, Slightly Damaged and A Neon Rome. Original percussionist Mike Armstrong left the band during the recording of their 1987 album Slowdance, and would later join King Cobb Steelie. The band's 1989 album Soapbox featured the song \\"Pat's Decline\\", the band's first single to garner widespread national exposure on MuchMusic and Brave New Waves. Drummer Ron Duffy left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Glenn Milchem for the recording of their 1992 album Smile. Following the recording, Milchem left to join Blue Rodeo, and was replaced by John Richardson. Bernard Maiezza, formerly of A Neon Rome, also joined the band during this era. Smile was produced by Michael-Philip Wojewoda, at the same time as he was juggling two other significant projects, Barenaked Ladies' Gordon and Rheostatics' Whale Music. The album, which was recorded in just four days on a budget of just $5,000,Brendan Kelly, \\"Change of Heart is anything but derivative; We're no Nirvana clone\\". Montreal Gazette, October 21, 1992. spawned the band's only Top 40 charting single, \\"There You Go\\", which took off after a radio program director in Saskatchewan placed the song in rotation on his station. The album, a sprawling 21-song release which the band acknowledged would have been a double album if it had been released prior to the compact disc era, was compared by critics to Sonic Youth's influential Daydream Nation.James Muretich, \\"CD almost drove Change of Heart mad\\". Calgary Herald, November 19, 1992. Fellow musicians also frequently praised the album; Milchem wore a Change of Heart T-shirt in Blue Rodeo's music video for \\"Rain Down on Me\\", Steven Page wore one in Barenaked Ladies' video for \\"Brian Wilson\\", and Andrew Scott wore one in Sloan's original video for \\"Underwhelmed\\". Following a cross-Canada tour with Crash Vegas, Taylor chose to leave the band. He was replaced by John Borra, Maiezza's former bandmate in A Neon Rome who had also previously toured as a solo artist opening for Change of Heart. The band then embarked on tours as an opening act for The Tragically Hip and Blue Rodeo. They also won $100,000 from that year's CFNY-FM \\"Discovery to Disc\\" competition, over Treble Charger and Killjoys.Jennie Punter, \\"12 years along, Change Of Heart comes of age: T.O.'s foremost indie squad primed for major touring\\". Toronto Star, December 29, 1994. Following the tour to support their 1994 album Tummysuckle, Borra left the band and was replaced by Rob Higgins for the band's final album, 1997's Steelteeth. Videos for the singles \\"Little Kingdoms\\" and \\"Grifter's Plow\\" received substantial airplay on MuchMusic's alternative showcase program The Wedge.

Edmonton Journal, July 18, 1999. but broke up soon afterward. Blurton, the band's singer and main songwriter, went on to form the bands Blurtonia and C'mon, as well as becoming a record producer. Maiezza went on to form Cookie Duster with Brendan Canning of hHead; that band released its debut album, produced by Blurton, in 2001.\\"Brendan Canning on Cookie Duster and Life After BSS: 'I Wanted a Fresh Perspective'\\".

The company's intent to develop a high-performance microprocessor implementing the SPARC architecture prompted Fujitsu to fund the company in 1991. $40.2 million was invested in return for a 44% stake. As part of the deal: # Fujitsu agreed to not increase their ownership of HAL. # Fujitsu would fabricate HAL's microprocessor designs. # Fujitsu would make its patents available to HAL. # Fujitsu would manufacture some of the HAL machines, and market them in Asia. In return, HAL gave Fujitsu access to the technology it was developing. By this time, HAL had 140 employees.\\"Fujitsu's $40m Buys 44% Of IBM Refugee's HAL Firm\\" In mid-1993, Heller resigned from his position as chairman and chief executive officer to become a consultant to Fujitsu Ltd. HAL said Heller had been developing roadmaps for Fujitsu and its subsidiaries ICL plc and Amdahl Corporation for the six months prior to his resignation, and had been less involved with HAL's daily operation.Heller Quits Top Job At HAL There were suggestions that Fujitsu was dissatisfied with HAL's progress and their failure to introduce systems with their 64-bit processor, but the company had no comment on the suggestions.Heller Quits HAL Computer To Steer Fujitsu Companies Towards Common UNIX The position of president was taken by Scott Metcalf, who was also the chief operating officer. In November 1993, Fujitsu paid more than $50 million for the remaining 56% of HAL it did not own. HAL became a wholly owned subsidiary of Fujitsu. HAL was very secretive about their product plans during their operation as an independent company. Initial systems were intended for a 1994 launch. The company produced multiple generations of computers based on microprocessors they had designed to the 64-bit SPARC V9 specification. Their processor design, known as SPARC64, combined out-of-order execution with mainframe-style reliability, availability and serviceability features. SPARC64 beat out Sun Microsystems' UltraSPARC I by a few months to be the first SPARC V9 microprocessor produced. Most of the sales of the company went to the Japanese market. Fujitsu closed the subsidiary in mid-2001. HAL later designed the SPARC64 II (previously known as the SPARC64+), SPARC64 III, and SPARC64 IV microprocessors. They also designed a microprocessor that was canceled when the division was closed by Fujitsu, known as the SPARC64 V. Fujitsu would later develop a microprocessor with the same name.  HAL Software Systems  HAL Software Systems was HAL's software division. Their first product was a Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) management tool. Later products, introduced in March 1994, included the Olias Browser, Olias Build Tools, Olias Remote Information Broker, and Olias Filter Development Kit. These products were for browsing and managing Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) and World Wide Web documents and relational databases. In mid-1996, Fujitsu had HAL Computer Systems spin off HAL Software Systems as Chisholm Technologies, Inc., a company financed by Fujitsu that developed Intranet administration tools.

Early life Born in Oviedo in 1883, his father died when he was six years old. His mother moved him to Bilbao in 1891. From a young age, he survived by selling magazines in the street. He eventually obtained work as a stenographer at the daily newspaper La Voz de Vizcaya, which led to a position as a copy editor and later a journalist at the rival daily El Liberal.Thomas, Hugh.

Princeton University Press. 1967. Princeton. p. 91 In 1899, at the age of 16, he had joined the PSOE. As a journalist in the first decade of the 20th century, Prieto became a leading figure of socialism in the Basque Country. Entering politics Spain's neutrality in World War I greatly benefited Spanish industry and commerce, but those benefits were not reflected in the workers' salaries. The period was one of great social unrest, culminating on August 13, 1917 in a revolutionary general strike. The government's fear of unrest like that of the February Revolution that year in Russia (the October Revolution there was still to come) caused it used the military to put down the general strike. Members of the strike committee were arrested in Madrid. Having been involved in organizing the strike, Prieto fled to France before he could be arrested. He did not return until April 1918, when he had been elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War Penguin Books.London. 2003. p. 40 Very critical of the actions of the government and army during the Rif War, or \\"War of Melilla\\" (1919‚Äì1926), Prieto spoke out strongly in the Congress after the Battle of Annual (1921). He also addressed the likely responsibility of the king in the imprudent military actions of General Manuel Fern√°ndez Silvestre in the Melilla command zone. Prieto was opposed to Francisco Largo Caballero's line of partial collaboration with the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939. London: Penguin Books, 2006, p. 17 He had bitter confrontations with both men. In August 1930, despite the opposition of party leader Juli√°n Besteiro Fern√°ndez, Prieto participated in the Pact of San Sebasti√°n. The broad coalition of republican parties proposed doing away with the Spanish monarchy.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939.

Princeton: Princeton University Press. 1967, p. 24 In that matter, Prieto was supported by Largo Caballero's wing of the party, as the latter believed that the fall of the monarchy was necessary so that socialism could rise to power. Second Spanish Republic When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed on April 14, 1931, Prieto was named finance minister in the provisional government, presided by Niceto Alcal√°- Zamora.Beevor, Antony.

The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books.London. 2001. p. 126 Before the republic, Prieto had arguably maintained a morr radical line than Largo Caballero, but he would now be identified as a relative moderate and opposed Largo Caballero's more revolutionary tendency. Prieto gave a thrilling campaign speech in Cuenca on 1 May 1936, prior to the 3 May repetition of the February 1936 election in the district in which the Popular Front would face among the right-wing rival Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera and, after the resignation of General Francisco Franco as candidate, Manuel Casanova. He brought Regenerationist memories and proposed Keynesian measures to develop the domestic market of the country. In words directed towards the firebrand faction of Largo Cabrello, Prieto asked for moderation, discipline and the disregarding of revolutionary excesses that would put the democratic government in peril. The speech in which Prieto also displayed a deep sense of patriotism (he claimed to \\"carry Spain within his heart\\" and \\"in the marrow of his bones\\") was celebrated by the republican press, and it was received well even by Jos√© Antonio, then in prison. However, it was met with hostility among the radicals, deepening the rupture within the party. Largo Caballero (1936). Spanish Civil War After the beginning of the Civil War, when news of the ruthless and systematic executions of Loyalists by the Nationalists, as part of General Mola's policy of instilling terror in their ranks, began to filter to the areas held by the government, Prieto made a fervent plea to Spanish republicans on 8 August in a radiocast: However, a couple of weeks after those words, the Modelo Massacre took place in Madrid, much to the dismay of many Popular Front leaders. Saddened, Prieto is recorded as expressing his pessimism with these words: \\"with this brutality we have lost the war\\". In September 1936, after the fall of Talavera de la Reina, in Toledo Province, to the rebels, Largo Caballero became the head of the government, and Prieto became Minister of Marine and Air.Beevor, Antony.

Positions  Supporting of the notion of further devolution to the Basque Provinces and Navarra, Prieto was greatly opposed to separatism as well as towards the plans of the Basque nationalists in the draft of the Estella Statute, fearing the prospect of the territory becoming a \\"reactionary Gibraltar and a clerical stronghold\\".

Its various communities have their own distinct musical traditions: the Chinese people form the largest ethnic group in Singapore, with Malays, Indians, and smaller number of other peoples of different ethnicity as well as Eurasians. The different people with their traditional forms of music, the various modern musical styles, and the fusion of different forms account for the musical diversity in the country. It has an urban musical scene, and is a center for pop, rock, punk and other genres in the region. The country has produced in the 1960s bands like The Crescendos and The Quests, right up to the new millennium with pop singers such as Stefanie Sun and JJ Lin. Folk music of Singapore includes the ethnic music traditions of the Chinese, Malay and Tamil communities. Singapore also has a lively Western classical music scene. Popular music Singapore has been a regional centre of music industry for a long time. Recordings of Chinese and Malay popular music were done at the EMI studio in Singapore in the colonial period, but until the 1960s, recordings were sent to be pressed in India and the records then sent back for sale. It was a centre of Malay popular culture where Malay stars such as P. Ramlee were based, but after Singapore independence in 1965, the Malay music industry began to shift to Kuala Lumpur. In the 1960s, local bands in Singapore were inspired by Western groups such as Blue Diamonds, Cliff Richard & the Shadows, and The Beatles. Popular groups of the period included The Crescendos who performed in English with hit songs like \\"Mr Twister\\", The Quests who had hits like \\"Shanty\\", \\"Don't Play That Song\\", \\"Jesamine\\" and \\"Mr Rainbow\\", as well as other pop-rock bands including The Thunderbirds, The Trailers, The Crescendos, The Western Union Band, October Cherries and The Silver Strings. A Malay genre influenced by British rock and pop called Pop Yeh-Yeh emerged in the 1960s. The bands performed in the Malay language, although some may also performed in English or were instrumental. Malay pop bands of the 1960s included Naomi & the Boys who produced a household hit song \\"Happy Happy Birthday Baby\\", D'4 Ever, Antarctics, Mike Ibrahim & the Nite Walkers, Swallows, Ismail Haron & the Guys, and Les Kafila's. In the late 1970s and early 1980s saw the rise of rock bands such as Sweet Charity fronted by the vocalist Ramli Sarip. The band had such an influence in the Singapore and Malaysia music scene that it later led to a rock explosion in the mid 1980s. Stefanie Sun, a pop singer from Singapore Singapore also emerged as a centre of local Chinese recording industry in the 1960s, producing Chinese pop music in Mandarin with local singers. From the 60s to the 80s, local stars such as Chang Siao Ying (ÂºµÂ∞èËã±), Sakura Teng (Ê®±Ëä±), Rita Chao (ÂáåÈõ≤), and Lena Lim (ÊûóÁ´πÂêõ) were popular in Singapore and Malaysia. A few, such as Lena Lim, also had some success outside the region. The pop music industry thrived by the 1980s, with several recording companies producing Chinese records by local as well as Taiwanese singers. Starting in the mid 1980s, a genre of Mandarin ballads called xinyao began to emerge with singers and/or songwriters such as Liang Wern Fook, Lee Shih Shiong, and Billy Koh. Local music labels such as Ocean Butterflies International and Hype Records were established. From the 1990s onwards, many Singaporean singers such as Kit Chan, Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Tanya Chua, Corrinne May, Fann Wong, and Mavis Hee had achieved wider success outside of Singapore. There are also a number artists from Singapore who work primarily in the English language, some such as singer-songwriter Sophie Koh are active outside of Singapore. In the 2010s, Singapore has seen a rise in home-grown acts like Charlie Lim, The Sam Willows, Gentle Bones, The Steve McQueens, Pleasantry, MYRNE, HubbaBubbas, Sam Rui, Leon Markcus, Scarlet Avenue and Nathan Hartono. Ethnic traditions =Chinese= Performance of a Teochew opera in Pulau Ubin, Singapore There are speakers of various dialects amongst the Chinese population, such as Hokkien, Hakka, Cantonese, and Teochew, and different dialect speakers may have their own clan associations which support their respective forms of opera. Opera troupes were first formed by amateur music clubs; the earliest amateur music club in Singapore is the Er Woo Amateur Music & Dramatic Association (È¶ÄÂ®±ÂÑí‰πêÁ§æ) set up in 1912 by Teochew businessmen, initially to promote music of the Hakkas (Hanju opera and Handiao music), later also Teochew opera. A number of recordings of Hanju opera performed by Er Woo were made in the 1920s and 1930s. Many professional and amateur opera troupes that performed in various dialects were later established. These opera troupes typically perform during festivals and national events, and may also hold regular small-scale performances, or large- scale ones annually or biannually. The professional troupes may also perform in opera theatres. During Chinese festivities there was also a minstrel tradition called zouchang (walk-sing), which involves walking performance by members of the operatic troupes. In the past, makeshift stages often appeared during festivities along the streets where operas may be performed. However, operas have declined as popular entertainment in the latter half of the 20th century; opera theatres closed, and street opera have mostly been replaced by getai where modern songs and comedy routines are performed, although street opera is still performed by professional and amateur opera troupes. Nanyin performance at Thian Hock Keng temple There are many full-sized Chinese orchestras in Singapore. The first Chinese orchestra was formed in 1959 by the Thau Yong Amateur Musical Association (Èô∂ËûçÂÑí‰πêÁ§æ), which was established in 1931 by former members of Er Woo. The Singapore Chinese Orchestra is the only professional Chinese orchestra in Singapore, however amateur Chinese orchestras formed by clan associations, community centres and schools are common. There are also chamber ensembles such as those of the Nanguan tradition from Siong Leng Musical Association. Drumming performances which accompany the traditional Lion Dance are also popular. =Malay= Music genres popular in neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia, such as Dondang Sayang and Keroncong, were also popular among Malays in Singapore. Vocal performances accompanied by kompang and hadrah drums are among the most popular types of Malay music in Singapore, and may be performed during weddings and official functions. Other vocal genres such as dikir barat and ghazal are also popular. An old tradition of Malay opera called Bangsawan existed since the 19th century but had declined, although there are modern attempts at reviving the genre. =Indian= Hindustani and Karnatic music are two forms of Indian classical music that may be found in Singapore. Other forms of music that are popular are Bhajan and Bhangra music, and professional Bhangra troupes may perform at festivities and special events. =Peranakan= The Peranakans are descendants of early Chinese immigrants who had intermarried with the local Malay population, and had adopted, partly or fully, Malay customs. Their folk music is noted for its fusion of English in Malay-inspired tunes, largely because the Peranakans themselves are often conversant in both languages. Contemporary tunes continue to be composed based on the Peranakan culture, such as \\"Bunga Sayang\\" composed in 1994, a theme song from Dick Lee's musical \\"Kampung Amber\\". The song became an often-sung staple of the National Day Parade, and gained international exposure when it was performed for the opening ceremony of the 117th IOC Session at the Esplanade. Western classical music A concert by National University of Singapore Symphony Orchestra Western classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, and at its center is the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) which was instituted in 1979. The main performance venue for the orchestra is the Esplanade Concert Hall, but it also performs in Victoria Concert Hall and gives the occasional free performances in parks. Other notable orchestras in Singapore include Singapore National Youth Orchestra which is funded by the Ministry of Education, the community-based Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra, The Philharmonic Orchestra, Orchestra of the Music Makers, and National University of Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Many orchestras and ensembles are also found in secondary schools and junior colleges. There are a few opera companies that present Western operas in Singapore: Singapore Lyric Opera which was founded in 1991, and New Opera Singapore established in 2011. There is also a lively local chamber music scene, which took off in 2007. A number of significant changes in the early 2000s boosted the development of the classical music scene in Singapore, in particular the building of the performing arts venue Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, and the establishment of the first conservatory of Singapore, Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music. Well-known classical musicians from Singapore include Lynnette Seah, Lim Soon Lee, Siow Lee Chin, and Abigail Sin. Some, such as conductor Darrell Ang and Vanessa-Mae, are expat working overseas, there are however an increasing number of local musicians who are actively involved in the classical music scene of Singapore. Some of these classical musicians have ventured into other genres and taken their music to public places, such as the Lorong Boys, who sometimes perform in MRT trains. Rock music Alternative and indie rock music influenced bands in the 1990s such as Concave Scream, Humpback Oak, The Padres, Oddfellows, and Livionia. In the Pop/Rock genres were \\"KICK!\\", Lizard's Convention & Radio Active. Recently, alternative, metal, grindcore, punk rock and rock acts from Singapore who gained some profile outside Singapore include Analog Girl, Amateur Takes Control, Cockpit, John Klass, Firebrands, Stompin' Ground, Ling Kai, Inch Chua, Ronin, Anna Judge April, Electrico, Force Vomit, The Observatory, 4-Sides, Vermillion, West Grand Boulevard, Plainsunset, Etc., sub:shaman, Caracal, Popland, The Great Spy Experiment, Sky In Euphoria, Rancour, Saw Loser (formerly known as Pug Jelly), Malex, A Vacant Affair, For Better Endings, Death Metal and Rudra, who are significant for creating the genre \\"Vedic Metal\\". =Metal= Metal has a small but not insignificant presence in Singapore's music scene. Many metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Exodus, Morbid Angel, Slayer, Dream Theater and Helloween made Singapore a stop in their tour, at venues such as Fort Canning Park and Singapore Indoor Stadium. Small to medium scale gigs are held almost weekly at locations such as BlackHole212 or The Substation. Most recently, on 15 February 2011, Iron Maiden played to a crowd of 12,000 at the Singapore Indoor Stadium. There have also been many notable local metal bands from many varying subgenres in the growing underground scene. Special mention includes: * Black metal stalwarts Impiety, * Extreme Metal veterans Rudra who created a new metal genre called Vedic Metal and a cult following worldwide. The band has also attracted the attention of Musicologists. Several papers have been published about Vedic Metal and the band, *Bastardized: Pioneer Doom Melodic Death metal band existing since 1993. \\"With Love, With Hate, With Grief, With Pain.\\" EP released under Valentine Sound Productions 1994. Poetry styled album \\"The Over Burdened\\" expected release in 2016. *Funeral Hearse signed by prominent American Metal Label Redefining Darkness Records, owned by Thomas Haywood of Aborted and Abigail Williams fame. * Wormrot has recently been signed by UK record label, Earache Records. *Local Death Metal \\"Assault\\" band new album \\"The Fallen Reich\\" features current Taiwan member of Parliament & \\"ChthoniC\\" Frontman Freddy Lim and Maldive metal band \\"Nothnegal\\" Guitarist Fufu. There is however little support for metal in Singapore's mainstream media. The heavy metal scene in Singapore therefore has established its own ways of disseminating information by utilizing popular internet based social mediums such as Facebook, Twitter and blogs. Some Metal music of this generation may be featured occasionally on Brader Bo's show, Vicious Volume of RIA 89.7fm. =Experimental/Improvised= Two Singapore rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s, Heritage and Zircon Lounge, showed tendencies to create music beyond conventional rock idioms. In the late 1980s, Corporate Toil baited audiences with noisy electronic performances influenced by industrial/new wave bands like Suicide or Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. In the 1990s, Kelvin Tan produced literally dozens of albums of avant folk and improvised guitar, as well as assembling the short-lived Stigmata featuring bassist Ian Woo and saxophonist Kelvin Guoh. Zai Kuning, largely known as a visual artist and dancer, lived for a period in Japan and collaborated musically with Tetsu Saitoh, a famed Japanese cellist. Zai also created his own form of Malay folk and gypsy blues music, singing incantations in his deep tenor while playing a loose form of open tuning guitar. By the late 1990s and into the 2000s, a group of experimental laptop artists appeared: George Chua, Yuen Chee Wai, Evan Tan, Ang Song Ming, and Chong Li-Chuan, the last having received the bachelor's and master's degrees in music at Goldsmiths College, University of London. Straddling the world of digital effects and acoustic instruments was the duo aspidistrafly, who eventually gained an enormous following in Japan, producing their own music and running their kitchen.label. The Observatory, a supergroup formed from the ashes of Leslie Low's folk rock Humpback Oak trio, have been widely regarded as one of the best bands in Singapore, with Yeow Kai Chai of The Straits Times writing, \\"No other Singapore band, past or present, has captured the imagination quite like The Observatory.\\"Yeow Kai Chai (26 August 2005). \\"Writing's on the Walls\\". The Straits Times. Page 10. Retrieved 18 August 2014. With every album, The Observatory have pushed at the limits of the song form, incorporating prog rock, jazz, avant garde guitar, drones, black metal, and more. Musical outsiders Engineered Beautiful Blood (Shark Fung and Wei Nan) blazed a hot trail of no wave improvised rock, then stopped playing in 2009. However, their members eventually formed a larger improvised rock ensemble, I\\\\D, which itself would splinter off into smaller groups and configurations. Shark Fung himself has been a key figure in the musical margins, with his idiosyncratic solo drums-and-electronics noise outfit Awk Wah, and forming the collective structured improv group BALBALAB with Wu Jun Han, Dennis Tan and Zai Tang in late 2014. Around the middle of the 2000s, another grouping calling themselves Under the Velvet Sky wowed audiences with their performances that evoked prog rock, free jazz, traditional Malay and Chinese music, and more. Again, the loose nature of the collective enabled them to create other projects such as Gulayu Arkestra, Five Leaves Left and Cactus - not to mention the solo efforts of members Jordan Johari Rais and Imran Abdul Rashid. The Flux_Us store at Peninsular Plaza, opened and run by the Singapore Sonic Arts Community, was an important space for a good two to three years around 2005‚Äì2007. Besides stocking local experimental music releases, they also imported CDs and records from international labels like Fonal, Rune Grammofon, Paw Tracks, Sublime Frequencies, Kranky, and more, being practically the only retailer where one could find such music. They also organised in-store gigs featuring local and international artists such as Lucas Abela. Above all the store provided a physical space for like-minded musicians and fans to meet and share ideas. The influence of an expatriate community cannot be ignored. Lindsay Vickery (Aus), Tim O'Dwyer (Aus), Darren Moore (Aus), Brian O'Reilly (US) and Dirk Johan Stromberg (US) all at some point associated with the music programmes at LASALLE College of the Arts, were involved in organising showcases and festivals of experimental and improvised music. Their interaction and collaboration with local players energised the local experimental music community. Since 2010, Ujikaji was established as a do-it-yourself experimental music label, distro and event organiser. It has released albums by Magus, Dream State Vision, and Awk Wah. It has been a partner of The Observatory in the innovative Playfreely series of improvised music events. Music venues Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay The most important venue for concert is the Esplanade, which replaced Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall as the primary concert hall of Singapore. The Singapore Conference Hall is used as a base for the Singapore Chinese Orchestra. There are also many clubs and music bars that offer live music in the city, particularly in the Clarke Quay area. =The Esplanade= In 2002, Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, which is the de facto national performing arts centre of Singapore, was launched. It focuses on the island's multi-genre music making, and is now the venue for the Singapore Symphony Orchestra's subscription and gala concerts. In addition, the arts centre has ensured a representation of classical and traditional music from the four primary cultures in the land. In particular, the regular festivals of Hua Yi, Pesta Raya and Kalaa Utsavam ensure that interpreters of these different repertories are heard on a regular basis. The Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay also presents 3 music festivals, including Baybeats which aims to groom the local alternative music scene and youth culture, providing opportunities for youths and the music community to participate and enjoy their own music at low cost. Many ticketed as well as non-ticketed performances at the Esplanade feature local musicians from Singapore. Music education Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music In Singapore, General Music Programme is offered to all students in primary and secondary schools. The Enhanced Music Programme, started in 2011, is offered as an upper secondary programme in selected schools. Tertiary music education is also available in Singapore ‚Äì the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music, which received its first student intake in 2003, is the first to offer a four-year full-time Bachelor of Music degree programme. The conservatory is part of the National University of Singapore founded in partnership with the Peabody Conservatory, and it serves as a centre of training for young musicians in the Asia Pacific region with full scholarship provided. Music education is also offered at other institutions such as Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, LASALLE College of the Arts, Raffles Music College and the School of the Arts. National Day songs Of particular note to the Singaporean music scene is what are often collectively known as National Day Songs (ÂõΩÂ∫Ü‰∏ªÈ¢òÊ≠å). Written as part of Singapore's nation-building efforts, they either incorporate local folk songs (such as \\"Chan Mali Chan\\"), contemporary songs (\\"The Magic Is You\\"), or are specifically composed around a particular theme for the National Day Parade which is held every year on August 9. The tradition of a National Day Song started in the 1980s, although there may not be a song every year, for example in 2014 when older songs were reprised. In 1984, \\"Stand Up for Singapore\\" was initially created for the sole purpose of celebrating Singapore's achievements in 25 years of self-government. Commissioned by the Ministry of Culture and composed by Hugh Harrison, the song struck a chord with Singaporeans, especially when they heard it performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and so the first 'official' National Day Song was born. The government, realizing just how much the public enjoyed singing as a way of celebrating, commissioned a new song for 1986. As a result, \\"Count On Me, Singapore\\", also composed by Hugh Harrison, arranged by Jeremy Monteiro and performed by Clement Chow, became the 2nd 'official' National Day Song. The trend continued the next year, 1987, with \\"We Are Singapore\\", again composed by Hugh Harrison and arranged by Jeremy Monteiro. \\"We Are Singapore\\" was used again in 2018 with some changes. Then, in 1990 with the addition of \\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\\" composed by Jeremy Monteiro with lyrics by Jim Aitchison for the nation's Silver Jubilee - 25 years of independence, the list of 'official' National Day Songs topped out at four. Since 1998, National Day Songs have become less 'grandiose' and more popular in nature being composed for and sung by selected local artists and sometimes even included in their albums to be marketed overseas. *1998: \\"Home\\" (ÂÆ∂), by Kit Chan *1999: \\"Together\\" (ÂøÉËøûÂøÉ), by Evelyn Tan and Dreamz FM *2000: \\"Shine on Me\\" (ÊòüÊúà), by Jai (English version) and Mavis Hee (Mandarin version) *2001: \\"Where I Belong\\" (Â±û‰∫é), by Tanya Chua *2002: \\"We Will Get There\\" (‰∏ÄËµ∑Ëµ∞Âà∞), by Stefanie Sun *2003: \\"One United People\\" (ÂÖ®ÂøÉÂÖ®ÊÑè), by Stefanie Sun *2004: \\"Home\\" (ÂÆ∂), remixed version by JJ Lin, Kit Chan *2005: \\"Reach Out For The Skies\\" (ÂãáÊï¢ÂêëÂâçÈ£û), a duet by Taufik Batisah and Rui En, composed by Elaine Chan. (The Chinese version is sung by Rui En only). *2006: \\"My Island Home\\" (Âπ∏Á¶èÁöÑÂõæÂΩ¢), by Kaira Gong *2007: \\"There's No Place I'd Rather Be\\", by Kit Chan (ÈôàÊ¥Å‰ª™) and Will you - Various Local Artiste *2008: \\"Shine for Singapore\\" (Êô¥Á©∫‰∏áÈáå), by Hady Mirza (English version) and Joi Chua (Mandarin version) *2009: \\"What Do You See\\" (Â∞±Âú®ËøôÈáå), by Electrico (English version) and Kelvin Tan (Mandarin version) *2010: \\"Song for Singapore\\", by Corrinne May *2011: \\"In a Heartbeat\\", by Sylvia Ratonel *2012: \\"Love At First Light\\", by Olivia Ong & Natanya Tan *2013: \\"One Singapore\\", by Sing A Nation Choir *2014: Reprise of older songs, such as the 2002 song \\"We Will Get There\\" by Farisha Ishak and Tay Ke Wei *2015: \\"Our Singapore\\", by JJ Lin *2016: \\"Tomorrow's Here Today\\" by 53A *2017: \\"Because It's Singapore\\" by Jay Lim *2018: \\"We Are Singapore\\" (revamp of the 1987's NDP song) *2019: \\"Our Singapore\\", by various artists Other community- building songs: *2005: \\"Sing Our Wishes\\" - Also used as official song for Ministry of Education schools for Racial Harmony Day 2005 *2005: \\"We Can\\" An ad-hoc offshoot of these National Day Songs are the songs specially composed for groundbreaking events. A prominent example was the song Moments of Magic, written by Hype Records CEO Ken Lim specially for Singapore's millennium celebrations towards the end of 1999. It was performed by three notable singers - Fann Wong, Tanya Chua and Elsa Lin. The music video was directed by Singapore filmmaker Eric Khoo. * 1999: \\"Moments of Magic\\", by Fann Wong, Tanya Chua and Elsa Lin References External links *MusicSG - digital archive of Singapore music *SOFT - It's Music in Singapore *SingaporeGigs - Live Music Guide to Singapore *Esplanade - Singapore‚Äôs National Performing Arts Centre *Singapore Night Festival *National Day Parade website ","title":"Music of Singapore"},{"id":"987318","text":"Jean-Claude Izzo (Marseille 20 June 1945 ‚Äì Marseille 26 January 2000) was a French poet, playwright, screenwriter, and novelist who achieved sudden fame in the mid-1990s with the publication of his three neo-noir crime novels Total Chaos, Chourmo, and Solea (widely known as the Marseilles Trilogy), featuring as protagonist ex-cop Fabio Montale, and set in the author's native city of Marseille.

Jean-Claude Izzo was born on 20 June 1945 in Marseille, France. His father was an Italian immigrant from Castel San Giorgio (Province of Salerno) and his maternal grandfather was a Spanish immigrant. He excelled in school and spent much of his time at his desk writing stories and poems. But because of his \\"immigrant\\" status, he was forced into a technical school where he was taught how to operate a lathe. In 1963, he began work in a bookstore. He also actively campaigned on behalf of Pax Christi, a Catholic peace movement. In 1964, he was called up for military duty in Toulon and Djibouti. He worked for the military newspaper as a photographer and journalist.  Bibliography  *Po√®mes √† haute voix (P.J. Oswald, 1970) *Terres de feu (P.J. Oswald, 1972) *√âtat de veille (P.J.

It also includes technologies that are designed to improve and repair brain function and allow researchers and clinicians to visualize the brain. Background The field of neurotechnology has been around for nearly half a century but has only reached maturity in the last twenty years. The advent of brain imaging revolutionized the field, allowing researchers to directly monitor the brain's activities during experiments. Neurotechnology has made significant impact on society, though its presence is so commonplace that many do not realize its ubiquity. From pharmaceutical drugs to brain scanning, neurotechnology affects nearly all industrialized people either directly or indirectly, be it from drugs for depression, sleep, ADD, or anti-neurotics to cancer scanning, stroke rehabilitation, and much more. As the field's depth increases it will potentially allow society to control and harness more of what the brain does and how it influences lifestyles and personalities. Commonplace technologies already attempt to do this; games like BrainAge,Nintendo Company of America. BrainAge (2006). Based on the work of Ryuta Kawashima, M.D. and programs like Fast ForWord that aim to improve brain function, are neurotechnologies. Currently, modern science can image nearly all aspects of the brain as well as control a degree of the function of the brain. It can help control depression, over-activation, sleep deprivation, and many other conditions. Therapeutically it can help improve stroke victims' motor coordination, improve brain function, reduce epileptic episodes (see epilepsy), improve patients with degenerative motor diseases (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, ALS), and can even help alleviate phantom pain perception. Advances in the field promise many new enhancements and rehabilitation methods for patients suffering from neurological problems. The neurotechnology revolution has given rise to the Decade of the Mind initiative, which was started in 2007. It also offers the possibility of revealing the mechanisms by which mind and consciousness emerge from the brain. Current technologies =Live Imaging= Magnetoencephalography is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are the most common magnetometer. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.Carlson, Neil R. (2013). Physiology of Behavior. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education Inc. pp 152-153 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used for scanning the brain for topological and landmark structure in the brain, but can also be used for imaging activation in the brain. While detail about how MRI works is reserved for the actual MRI article, the uses of MRI are far reaching in the study of neuroscience. It is a cornerstone technology in studying the mind, especially with the advent of functional MRI (fMRI). Functional MRI measures the oxygen levels in the brain upon activation (higher oxygen content = neural activation) and allows researchers to understand what loci are responsible for activation under a given stimulus. This technology is a large improvement to single cell or loci activation by means of exposing the brain and contact stimulation. Functional MRI allows researchers to draw associative relationships between different loci and regions of the brain and provides a large amount of knowledge in establishing new landmarks and loci in the brain. Computed tomography (CT) is another technology used for scanning the brain. It has been used since the 1970s and is another tool used by neuroscientists to track brain structure and activation. While many of the functions of CT scans are now done using MRI, CT can still be used as the mode by which brain activation and brain injury are detected. Using an X-ray, researchers can detect radioactive markers in the brain that indicate brain activation as a tool to establish relationships in the brain as well as detect many injuries/diseases that can cause lasting damage to the brain such as aneurysms, degeneration, and cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) is another imaging technology that aids researchers. Instead of using magnetic resonance or X-rays, PET scans rely on positron emitting markers that are bound to a biologically relevant marker such as glucose. The more activation in the brain the more that region requires nutrients, so higher activation appears more brightly on an image of the brain. PET scans are becoming more frequently used by researchers because PET scans are activated due to metabolism whereas MRI is activated on a more physiological basis (sugar activation versus oxygen activation). =Transcranial magnetic stimulation= Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is essentially direct magnetic stimulation to the brain. Because electric currents and magnetic fields are intrinsically related, by stimulating the brain with magnetic pulses it is possible to interfere with specific loci in the brain to produce a predictable effect.Wasserman, E.M. (1996) This field of study is currently receiving a large amount of attention due to the potential benefits that could come out of better understanding this technology. Transcranial magnetic movement of particles in the brain shows promise for drug targeting and delivery as studies have demonstrated this to be noninvasive on brain physiology. =Transcranial direct current stimulation= Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of neurostimulation which uses constant, low current delivered via electrodes placed on the scalp. The mechanisms underlying tDCS effects are still incompletely understood, but recent advances in neurotechnology allowing for in vivo assessment of brain electric activity during tDCS promise to advance understanding of these mechanisms. Research into using tDCS on healthy adults have demonstrated that tDCS can increase cognitive performance on a variety of tasks, depending on the area of the brain being stimulated. tDCS has been used to enhance language and mathematical ability (though one form of tDCS was also found to inhibit math learning), attention span, problem solving, memory, and coordination. =Cranial surface measurements= Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method of measuring brainwave activity non-invasively. A number of electrodes are placed around the head and scalp and electrical signals are measured. Typically EEGs are used when dealing with sleep, as there are characteristic wave patterns associated with different stages of sleep. Clinically EEGs are used to study epilepsy as well as stroke and tumor presence in the brain. EEGs are a different method to understand the electrical signaling in the brain during activation. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is another method of measuring activity in the brain by measuring the magnetic fields that arise from electrical currents in the brain. The benefit to using MEG instead of EEG is that these fields are highly localized and give rise to better understanding of how specific loci react to stimulation or if these regions over-activate (as in epileptic seizures). =Implant technologies= Neurodevices are any devices used to monitor or regulate brain activity. Currently there are a few available for clinical use as a treatment for Parkinson's disease. The most common neurodevices are deep brain stimulators (DBS) that are used to give electrical stimulation to areas stricken by inactivity. Parkinson's disease is known to be caused by an inactivation of the basal ganglia (nuclei) and recently DBS has become the more preferred form of treatment for Parkinson's disease, although current research questions the efficiency of DBS for movement disorders. Neuromodulation is a relatively new field that combines the use of neurodevices and neurochemistry. The basis of this field is that the brain can be regulated using a number of different factors (metabolic, electrical stimulation, physiological) and that all these can be modulated by devices implanted in the neural network. While currently this field is still in the researcher phase, it represents a new type of technological integration in the field of neurotechnology. The brain is a very sensitive organ, so in addition to researching the amazing things that neuromodulation and implanted neural devices can produce, it is important to research ways to create devices that elicit as few negative responses from the body as possible. This can be done by modifying the material surface chemistry of neural implants. =Cell therapy= Researchers have begun looking at uses for stem cells in the brain, which recently have been found in a few loci. A large number of studies are being done to determine if this form of therapy could be used in a large scale. Experiments have successfully used stem cells in the brains of children who suffered from injuries in gestation and elderly people with degenerative diseases in order to induce the brain to produce new cells and to make more connections between neurons. =Pharmaceuticals= Pharmaceuticals play a vital role in maintaining stable brain chemistry, and are the most commonly used neurotechnology by the general public and medicine. Drugs like sertraline, methylphenidate, and zolpidem act as chemical modulators in the brain, and they allow for normal activity in many people whose brains cannot act normally under physiological conditions. While pharmaceuticals are usually not mentioned and have their own field, the role of pharmaceuticals is perhaps the most far-reaching and commonplace in modern society (the focus on this article will largely ignore neuropharmaceuticals, for more information, see neuropsychopharmacology). Movement of magnetic particles to targeted brain regions for drug delivery is an emerging field of study and causes no detectable circuit damage. =Low field magnetic stimulation= Stimulation with low-intensity magnetic fields is currently under study for depression at Harvard Medical School, and has previously been explored by Bell. It has FDA approval for treatment of depression. It is also being researched for other applications such as autism. One issue is that no two brains are alike and stimulation can cause either polarization or depolarization. (et al.), Marino (et al.), and others. How these help study the brain Magnetic resonance imaging is a vital tool in neurological research in showing activation in the brain as well as providing a comprehensive image of the brain being studied. While MRIs are used clinically for showing brain size, it still has relevance in the study of brains because it can be used to determine extent of injuries or deformation. These can have a significant effect on personality, sense perception, memory, higher order thinking, movement, and spatial understanding. However, current research tends to focus more so on fMRI or real-time functional MRI (rtfMRI). These two methods allow the scientist or the participant, respectively, to view activation in the brain. This is incredibly vital in understanding how a person thinks and how their brain reacts to a person's environment, as well as understanding how the brain works under various stressors or dysfunctions. Real-time functional MRI is a revolutionary tool available to neurologists and neuroscientists because patients can see how their brain reacts to stressors and can perceive visual feedback. CT scans are very similar to MRI in their academic use because they can be used to image the brain upon injury, but they are more limited in perceptual feedback. CTs are generally used in clinical studies far more than in academic studies, and are found far more often in a hospital than a research facility. PET scans are also finding more relevance in academia because they can be used to observe metabolic uptake of neurons, giving researchers a wider perspective about neural activity in the brain for a given condition. Combinations of these methods can provide researchers with knowledge of both physiological and metabolic behaviors of loci in the brain and can be used to explain activation and deactivation of parts of the brain under specific conditions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a relatively new method of studying how the brain functions and is used in many research labs focused on behavioral disorders and hallucinations. What makes TMS research so interesting in the neuroscience community is that it can target specific regions of the brain and shut them down or activate temporarily; thereby changing the way the brain behaves. Personality disorders can stem from a variety of external factors, but when the disorder stems from the circuitry of the brain TMS can be used to deactivate the circuitry. This can give rise to a number of responses, ranging from ‚Äúnormality‚Äù to something more unexpected, but current research is based on the theory that use of TMS could radically change treatment and perhaps act as a cure for personality disorders and hallucinations. Currently, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is being researched to see if this deactivation effect can be made more permanent in patients suffering from these disorders. Some techniques combine TMS and another scanning method such as EEG to get additional information about brain activity such as cortical response. Both EEG and MEG are currently being used to study the brain's activity under different conditions. Each uses similar principles but allows researchers to examine individual regions of the brain, allowing isolation and potentially specific classification of active regions. As mentioned above, EEG is very useful in analysis of immobile patients, typically during the sleep cycle. While there are other types of research that utilize EEG, EEG has been fundamental in understanding the resting brain during sleep. There are other potential uses for EEG and MEG such as charting rehabilitation and improvement after trauma as well as testing neural conductivity in specific regions of epileptics or patients with personality disorders. Neuromodulation can involve numerous technologies combined or used independently to achieve a desired effect in the brain. Gene and cell therapy are becoming more prevalent in research and clinical trials and these technologies could help stunt or even reverse disease progression in the central nervous system. Deep brain stimulation is currently used in many patients with movement disorders and is used to improve the quality of life in patients. While deep brain stimulation is a method to study how the brain functions per se, it provides both surgeons and neurologists important information about how the brain works when certain small regions of the basal ganglia (nuclei) are stimulated by electrical currents. Future technologies The future of neurotechnologies lies in how they are fundamentally applied, and not so much on what new versions will be developed. Current technologies give a large amount of insight into the mind and how the brain functions, but basic research is still needed to demonstrate the more applied functions of these technologies. Currently, rtfMRI is being researched as a method for pain therapy have shown that there is a significant improvement in the way people perceive pain if they are made aware of how their brain is functioning while in pain. By providing direct and understandable feedback, researchers can help patients with chronic pain decrease their symptoms. This new type of bio/mechanical-feedback is a new development in pain therapy. Functional MRI is also being considered for a number of more applicable uses outside of the clinic. Research has been done on testing the efficiency of mapping the brain in the case when someone lies as a new way to detect lying. Along the same vein, EEG has been considered for use in lie detection as well. TMS is being used in a variety of potential therapies for patients with personality disorders, epilepsy, PTSD, migraine, and other brain-firing disorders, but has been found to have varying clinical success for each condition. The end result of such research would be to develop a method to alter the brain's perception and firing and train patients' brains to rewire permanently under inhibiting conditions (for more information see rTMS). In addition, PET scans have been found to be 93% accurate in detecting Alzheimer's disease nearly 3 years before conventional diagnosis, indicating that PET scanning is becoming more useful in both the laboratory and the clinic.Mosconi, L., et al. (2005) Stem cell technologies are always salient both in the minds of the general public and scientists because of their large potential. Recent advances in stem cell research have allowed researchers to ethically pursue studies in nearly every facet of the body, which includes the brain. Research has shown that while most of the brain does not regenerate and is typically a very difficult environment to foster regeneration, there are portions of the brain with regenerative capabilities (specifically the hippocampus and the olfactory bulbs). Much of the research in central nervous system regeneration is how to overcome this poor regenerative quality of the brain. It is important to note that there are therapies that improve cognition and increase the amount of neural pathways, but this does not mean that there is a proliferation of neural cells in the brain. Rather, it is called a plastic rewiring of the brain (plastic because it indicates malleability) and is considered a vital part of growth. Nevertheless, many problems in patients stem from death of neurons in the brain, and researchers in the field are striving to produce technologies that enable regeneration in patients with stroke, Parkinson's diseases, severe trauma, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as many others. While still in fledgling stages of development, researchers have recently begun making very interesting progress in attempting to treat these diseases. Researchers have recently successfully produced dopaminergic neurons for transplant in patients with Parkinson's diseases with the hopes that they will be able to move again with a more steady supply of dopamine. Many researchers are building scaffolds that could be transplanted into a patient with spinal cord trauma to present an environment that promotes growth of axons (portions of the cell attributed with transmission of electrical signals) so that patients unable to move or feel might be able to do so again. The potentials are wide-ranging, but it is important to note that many of these therapies are still in the laboratory phase and are slowly being adapted in the clinic. Some scientists remain skeptical with the development of the field, and warn that there is a much larger chance that electrical prosthesis will be developed to solve clinical problems such as hearing loss or paralysis before cell therapy is used in a clinic.Personal correspondence with Dr. Robert Gross Novel drug delivery systems are being researched in order to improve the lives of those who struggle with brain disorders that might not be treated with stem cells, modulation, or rehabilitation. Pharmaceuticals play a very important role in society, and the brain has a very selective barrier that prevents some drugs from going from the blood to the brain. There are some diseases of the brain such as meningitis that require doctors to directly inject medicine into the spinal cord because the drug cannot cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Research is being conducted to investigate new methods of targeting the brain using the blood supply, as it is much easier to inject into the blood than the spine. New technologies such as nanotechnology are being researched for selective drug delivery, but these technologies have problems as with any other. One of the major setbacks is that when a particle is too large, the patient's liver will take up the particle and degrade it for excretion, but if the particle is too small there will not be enough drug in the particle to take effect. In addition, the size of the capillary pore is important because too large a particle might not fit or even plug up the hole, preventing adequate supply of the drug to the brain. Other research is involved in integrating a protein device between the layers to create a free-flowing gate that is unimpeded by the limitations of the body. Another direction is receptor-mediated transport, where receptors in the brain used to transport nutrients are manipulated to transport drugs across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Some have even suggested that focused ultrasound opens the blood‚Äìbrain barrier momentarily and allows free passage of chemicals into the brain. Ultimately the goal for drug delivery is to develop a method that maximizes the amount of drug in the loci with as little degraded in the blood stream as possible. Neuromodulation is a technology currently used for patients with movement disorders, although research is currently being done to apply this technology to other disorders. Recently, a study was done on if DBS could improve depression with positive results, indicating that this technology might have potential as a therapy for multiple disorders in the brain. DBS is limited by its high cost however, and in developing countries the availability of DBS is very limited. A new version of DBS is under investigation and has developed into the novel field, optogenetics. Optogenetics is the combination of deep brain stimulation with fiber optics and gene therapy. Essentially, the fiber optic cables are designed to light up under electrical stimulation, and a protein would be added to a neuron via gene therapy to excite it under light stimuli. So by combining these three independent fields, a surgeon could excite a single and specific neuron in order to help treat a patient with some disorder. Neuromodulation offers a wide degree of therapy for many patients, but due to the nature of the disorders it is currently used to treat its effects are often temporary. Future goals in the field hope to alleviate that problem by increasing the years of effect until DBS can be used for the remainder of the patient's life. Another use for neuromodulation would be in building neuro- interface prosthetic devices that would allow quadriplegics the ability to maneuver a cursor on a screen with their thoughts, thereby increasing their ability to interact with others around them. By understanding the motor cortex and understanding how the brain signals motion, it is possible to emulate this response on a computer screen. Ethics =Stem cells= The ethical debate about use of embryonic stem cells has stirred controversy both in the United States and abroad; although more recently these debates have lessened due to modern advances in creating induced pluripotent stem cells from adult cells. The greatest advantage for use of embryonic stem cells is the fact that they can differentiate (become) nearly any type of cell provided the right conditions and signals. However, recent advances by Shinya Yamanaka et al. have found ways to create pluripotent cells without the use of such controversial cell cultures. Using the patient's own cells and re- differentiating them into the desired cell type bypasses both possible patient rejection of the embryonic stem cells and any ethical concerns associated with using them, while also providing researchers a larger supply of available cells. However, induced pluripotent cells have the potential to form benign (though potentially malignant) tumors, and tend to have poor survivability in vivo (in the living body) on damaged tissue. Much of the ethics concerning use of stem cells has subsided from the embryonic/adult stem cell debate due to its rendered moot, but now societies find themselves debating whether or not this technology can be ethically used. Enhancements of traits, use of animals for tissue scaffolding, and even arguments for moral degeneration have been made with the fears that if this technology reaches its full potential a new paradigm shift will occur in human behavior. =Military application= New neurotechnologies have always garnered the appeal of governments, from lie detection technology and virtual reality to rehabilitation and understanding the psyche. Due to the Iraq War and War on Terror, American soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan are reported to have percentages up to 12% with PTSD. There are many researchers hoping to improve these peoples' conditions by implementing new strategies for recovery. By combining pharmaceuticals and neurotechnologies, some researchers have discovered ways of lowering the \\"fear\\" response and theorize that it may be applicable to PTSD. Virtual reality is another technology that has drawn much attention in the military. If improved, it could be possible to train soldiers how to deal with complex situations in times of peace, in order to better prepare and train a modern army. =Privacy= Finally, when these technologies are being developed society must understand that these neurotechnologies could reveal the one thing that people can always keep secret: what they are thinking. While there are large amounts of benefits associated with these technologies, it is necessary for scientists, citizens and policy makers alike to consider implications for privacy. This term is important in many ethical circles concerned with the state and goals of progress in the field of neurotechnology (see Neuroethics). Current improvements such as ‚Äúbrain fingerprinting‚Äù or lie detection using EEG or fMRI could give rise to a set fixture of loci/emotional relationships in the brain, although these technologies are still years away from full application. It is important to consider how all these neurotechnologies might affect the future of society, and it is suggested that political, scientific, and civil debates are heard about the implementation of these newer technologies that potentially offer a new wealth of once-private information. Some ethicists are also concerned with the use of TMS and fear that the technique could be used to alter patients in ways that are undesired by the patient. =Cognitive liberty= Cognitive liberty refers to a suggested right to self-determination of individuals to control their own mental processes, cognition, and consciousness including by the use of various neurotechnologies and psychoactive substances. This perceived right is relevant for reformation and development of associated laws.

The first is Life Lessons, directed by Martin Scorsese, written by Richard Price and starring Nick Nolte. The second is Life Without Zo√´, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and written by Coppola with his daughter, Sofia Coppola. The last is Oedipus Wrecks, directed, written by and starring Woody Allen. In foreign theatrical releases, the order of the three films was altered, Coppola‚Äôs being first, followed by Allen‚Äôs, and finishing with Scorsese‚Äôs. The film was screened out of competition at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. Plot =Life Lessons= Lionel Dobie is an acclaimed abstract artist who finds himself unable to paint during the days before a scheduled gallery exhibition of his new work. Paulette is Lionel's assistant and former lover. Lionel is still infatuated with her, but Paulette wants only his tutelage, which makes things difficult since they live in the same studio-loft. Paulette dates other people, including a performance artist and a painter. These deliberate provocations on Paulette's part make Lionel insanely jealous‚Äîand fuel his creativity. Lionel and Paulette, it becomes clear, have been using each other: Lionel using her sexually, Paulette using him as a means of entry into the higher spheres of the New York social and art scene. Paulette wants to give up and go home to her parents but Lionel persuades her to stay because New York is where a painter needs to be. Lionel pours his anxiety and repressed passion into his work. Paintings around the studio show visual metaphors from relations past: stormy skies, burning bridges, and tormented clowns. Lionel realizes that he needs the emotional turmoil of his destructive relationships in order to fuel his art. At the art exhibit, Lionel meets another attractive young woman, a struggling painter. He persuades her to become his assistant and potentially his lover, beginning the cycle anew. =Life Without Zo√´= Zo√´ is a schoolgirl who lives in a luxury hotel. She helps return to an Arab princess a valuable piece of jewelry that the princess had given to Zo√´'s father and had been subsequently stolen and recovered. Zo√´ tries to reconcile her divorced mother, a photographer, and father, a flautist. =Oedipus Wrecks= New York lawyer Sheldon Mills has problems with his overly critical mother Sadie Millstein. Sheldon complains constantly to his therapist about her, wishing aloud that she would just disappear. Sheldon takes his shiksa fianc√©e, Lisa, to meet his mother, who immediately embarrasses him. The three, as well as Lisa's children from a previous marriage, go to a magic show. His mother is invited on stage to be a part of the magician's act. She is put inside a box that has swords stuck through it and she disappears, just as she is supposed to, but then she never reappears. Although he is furious at first, this development turns out to be great for Sheldon because, with her out of his life, he can finally relax. But soon, to his horror, his mother reappears in the sky over New York City. She begins to annoy Sheldon and Lisa (with the whole city now watching) by constantly talking to strangers about his most embarrassing moments. This puts a strain on his relationship with Lisa, who leaves him. Sheldon is persuaded by his psychiatrist to see a psychic, Treva, to try to get his mother back to reality. Treva's experiments fail, but Sheldon falls for her. When he introduces Treva to his mother, she approves and comes back to Earth.

Allen and Scorsese's segments of the film have generally been praised. However, Hal Hinson, writing in The Washington Post felt that Coppola's segment was \\"by far the director's worst work yet.\\" Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two and a half stars, saying \\"New York Stories consists of three films, one good, one bad, one disappointing.\\" He further explained, \\"Of the three films, the only really successful one is Life Lessons, the Scorsese story of a middle-age painter and his young, discontented girlfriend. The Coppola, an updated version of the story of Eloise, the little girl who lived in the Plaza Hotel, is surprisingly thin and unfocused. And the Allen, about a 50-year-old man still dominated by his mother, starts well but then takes a wrong turn about halfway through.\\" References External links * John Walker. \\"New York Stories: Life Lessons film review\\".

Music is a large part of Botswana culture, and includes popular and folk forms. Botswana church choirs are common nationwide. Tswana people were the earliest inhabitants of the land that is today known as the Botswana and played its first music. Beginning in the 19th century, Immigrants from the United Kingdom began arriving in large numbers and they called the colony Bechuanaland. Popular music Just like other African countries, popular music in Botswana is called \\"jazz\\"; however, it has little resemblance to the African American genre of the same name. There is an initiative to focus on revitalizing the Botswana music industry, instead of relying on foreign releases. Popular music in Botswana still comes from South Africa, the United States, Europe or elsewhere in Africa. Gumba- gumba is a form of modernized Zulu and Tswana music, mixed with traditional jazz. Music of Botswana is minor in world music scene. Music of Botswana is introduced from British music media and French music media. =Botswana hip hop= Hip hop is a cultural movement, of which music is a part. Hip hop music for the most part is itself composed of two parts: rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals; and DJing and/or producing, the production of instrumentation through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism, or beatboxing, the production of musical sounds through vocalized tones.[135] The national hip hop radio show Strictly Hip Hop, hosted by Draztik and Slim (of the Cashless Society Crew and co-founders of Unreleased Records), has done much for the Botswana hip-hop scene. Dagee Records and Phat Boy are a noted hip-hop record labels. Motswako is also a popular genre. ÈùûÊ¥≤Èºì =Folk music= Tswana music is primarily vocal, performed without drums and makes extensive use of string instruments, particularly the guitar. In the absence of drums, a clapping rhythm is used in music with a typical call-and-response vocal style.

It has a slower rhythm than original rhumba (increasing in tempo towards the middle of the song) and is calmer in style than its parent form, Afro-rhumba. Some artists have attempted to speed up kwasa kwasa and make it more danceable. Artist Vee is one; his style is known as kwaito kwasa, a combination of kwaito music and kwasa kwasa rhythms and guitar.Culture and customs of Botswana by James Raymond Denbow and Phenyo C. Thebe.

The music has begun to gain momentum, partly due to mainstream media such as MTV, Channel O and the internet. The native Batswana have demonstrated an appreciation for this genre, and since 2000 many new bands have been formed; most play locally, but a few have toured southern Africa.

Industry and economics  Radio stations in the Botswana often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same as ordinary generic classification. Many radio stations in the Botswana are locally owned media. An independent music industry (indie music) does exist and artists remain at an indie label for their entire careers. Indie music may be in styles generally similar to mainstream music, but is often inaccessible, unusual, or otherwise unappealing to many people. Indie musicians often release some or all of their songs over the Internet for fans and others to download and listen.  Education  Music is an important part of education in Botswana, and is a part of most or all school systems in the country. Music education is generally not mandatory in junior schools, and is an elective in later years. High schools generally offer classes in singing, mostly choral, and instrumentation in the form of a large school band. Large universities account for most of the music degrees in the United States, though there are important small musicacademies and conservatories. University music departments may sponsor bands ranging from marching bands that are an important part of collegiate sporting events, prominently featuring fight songs, to barbershop groups, glee clubs, jazz ensembles and symphonies, and may additionally sponsor musical outreach programs, such as by bringing foreign performers to the area for concerts.  Holidays and festivals  Music is an important part of several Botswana holidays, especially playing a major part in the celebration of Christmas. Botswana is home to numerous music festivals, which showcase styles ranging from house, jazz and hip hop. Some music festivals are opened in local area.

The country is a second home for many of the pan-Caribbean genres of popular music, and has produced stars in calypso, soca, steeldrum, zouk and reggae. Of these, steeldrum and calypso are the most integral parts of modern Antiguan popular music; both styles are imported from the music of Trinidad and Tobago. Little to no musical research has been undertaken on Antigua and Barbuda. As a result, much knowledge on the topic derives from novels, essays and other secondary sources.  History  Documented music in Antigua and Barbuda began only with the discovery of Antigua, then populated by Arawak and Caribs, by Christopher Columbus in 1493. The islands' early music, however, remains little studied. In the 1780s, documentation exists for African workers participating in outdoor dances accompanied by the banjar (later ', perhaps related to the banjo) and toombah (later tum tum), a drum decorated with shell and tin jingles. cited in McDaniel, pp 798-800 By the 1840s, sophisticated subscription balls were common, held biweekly with European-derived quadrilles accompanied by fiddle, tambourine and triangle. cited in McDaniel, pp 798-800 Colonial era churches and missionary activity displaced and otherwise influenced the music of the African slaves, who adopted elements of European-derived religious music. The brass bands of the Salvation Army are an important example. In the mid- to late 19th century, a number of Portuguese indentured workers came to Antigua, bringing with them their styles of music. When most of the Portuguese left in the 1880s, Lebanese music was brought to the island by immigrants from that country.  Folk music  During the period of French colonial rule, African slaves were prohibited from celebrating in Carnival; they continued to do so, secretly, at home. There, an Afro-Caribbean style of percussion, dance and song called benna developed. Later, Antiguan and Barbudan folk music became more dominated by Trinidadian calypso and steelpan. Most forms of modern Antiguan and Barbudan music are not indigenous to the islands, and were imported from France, the United Kingdom, United States, Jamaica and Trinidad. Colonial dance styles like the highland fling and the quadrille remain popular in Africanized form. The loss of Antiguan traditions can be ascribed to the lack of a French colonial past (French islands of the Lesser Antilles retain much African-derived music and dance), the influence of the powerful Codrington family, a relatively unified African ethnic identity, the lack of African immigration after the peak of slavery importation, the British military presence at Shirley Heights and a modern history of unstable economy and government. = Old Time Christmas Festival = The Old Time Christmas Festival was a culturally significant celebration, replaced in 1957 by a Trinidadian-inspired Carnival. The Antiguan Christmas Festival included several elements that have been adopted into the modern Carnival. Christmas Festival traditions include both music and dance, especially related to masquerades and iron bands. The highland fling is a common Christmas Festival dance, also played in the modern Carnival, performed by people wearing Scottish kilts, masks made of wire and bearing whips of cowhide. Dancers wearing banana leaves and animal horns took part in the John Bull, while carolers paraded with long poles covered in lanterns, called carol trees, singing with accompaniment by the concertina. Stilt dancers in robes, called the Moko jumbie, Jumpa-Ben or Long Ghosts, were also common, and were accompanied by kettle and bass drums, fife, triangle (cling-a-ching) and the boompipe, made from a plumbing joint one meter long. = Benna = Benna (or bennah) is an uptempo Antiguan folk song that was introduced following the prohibition of slavery. Songs usually focused on scandalous and bawdy rumors and gossip, and were in a call-and-response form with a leader and an audience. Benna's popularity and similarity to calypso helped make the island receptive to that genre's introduction. The modern performer King Short Shirt has attempted to revive the benna in modern years, with his 1977 album Harambee an influential work that began updating benna with social and political awareness. By the beginning of the 20th century, it had become a method of folk communication, disseminating news and reports from across the island. In the 1940s and 50s, an improvisational benna singer named John \\"Quarkoo\\" Thomas sang up-to-date stories on legal scandals, and the sexual affairs of the upper-class. He was eventually imprisoned because of the lyrics to \\"Cocoatea\\", which was about the daughter of a respected citizen, and her secret pregnancy while in a convent.Antigua and Barbuda's Cultural Heritage and McDaniel, pp 798-800 = Popular music = In other popular genres of music Antigua is best known for oldest and most successful soca band the Burning Flames, who have claimed the road march title for many years, most recently 2005. Another well-known Antiguan musician was Patrick \\"Johnny\\" Gomes, who worked for, among many others, the calypso giant Mighty Swallow. The most famous indigenous musician in Antigua and Barbuda may be Oscar Mason, whose son O'Neill is also a noted trombonist.De Ledesma and Popplewell, pg. 520 The Antigua Community Players have been active for more than 52 years, performing a variety of musical productions in many styles, including the Antiguan folk song, benna. Other famous indigenous musicians from Antigua/Barbuda are Rawden Edwards (keyboards); jazz recording artists Roland Prince (guitarist), Courtney Winter (saxophonist); Wendell Richardson, a former lead vocalist/guitarist, and founder member of Osibisa; and up and coming world jazz vocalist Charmain Bailey. Country recording artists Billy Rose and Wayne Daniel were also born on the island of Antigua. Basil Hill, owner of King Midas Records in New York, built a large international nightclub called the Atmosphere in 1978, creating a direct outlet for Antigua and Barbudan singers and bands. Elements of non-Antiguan and Barbudan music have continued to be imported to the islands in the latter 20th century, including the electronic gospel music of the American Baptist church, and the Afro- Jamaican drumming of Rastafarian music. = Carnival = See full article: Antigua Carnival The Antiguan Carnival is a celebration of music and dance held annually from the end of July to the first Tuesday in August. The most important day is that of the j'ouvert (or juv√©), in which brass and steel bands perform for much of the island's population. Barbuda's Carnival in June, and is known as Caribana.Cameron, pg. 480 The Antiguan and Barbudan Carnivals replaced the Old Time Christmas Festival in 1957, with hopes of inspiring tourism in Antigua and Barbuda. Some elements of the Christmas Festival remain in the modern Carnival celebrations, which are otherwise largely based on the Trinidadian Carnival. The author Frank Manning has argued that this change, from indigenous traditions to tourist-oriented elements, has reduced Antiguans to \\"positions as service personnel and 'mimic men', robbing the culture of its natural integrity and cultural history\\".Quote from McDaniel, pp 798‚Äì800, describing = Music festival = The Antigua and Barbuda international music festival, Romantic Rhythms, is a new addition to the summer line-up that peaks in August at the notorious Carnival celebrations. Geared to becoming a competing counterpart to the Carnival, the festival could eventually become the leading musical event in the entire Caribbean region. In its first year of establishment, the music festival already had some of the world's top artists perform. = Steelpan = The steelpan comes in many different forms, and put together is called a steel orchestra. Steel bands traditionally are made up of old pieces of metal such as old irons, tire rims, or steel pipes. Antigua's steel orchestras and iron bands can be found in churches and in many villages, and have been popular since their introduction. Every Carnival there is a competition to dub the best band of the island. Antigua's largest and oldest steel orchestra that still competes is Hell's Gate. It is said that the Brute Force Steel Band was the first steelpan band to record an album. Steel orchestras have evolved to using highly technical instruments costing up to US$1500 for one instrument. These pans are meticulously honed out of the steel drum, sunken and burned over a hot fire, chromed and tuned. This process was perfected in Trinidad and Tobago and exported to Antigua and Barbuda through various collaborations between several of the bands in both island-nations. = Calypso = Calypso was sung throughout the English-speaking Caribbean, and was used by the poor as a platform for social and political commentary, using complex metaphors and folkloric references to obscure their meaning to outsiders. Later, beginning in the 1960s, a popularized kind of calypso was developed for use in tourist hotels. The first hotel calypsonians were Black Shirt, Skeetch and Dadian, who were accompanied by a string ensemble of two guitars and a bass guitar (created out of an oil drum). The Antigua Carnival, and the Antiguan Calypso King competition, began in 1957; the King that year was Styler. This era also saw a growth in patriotic calypsos, focused on an emerging sense of victorious nationalism in the wake of growing autonomy. By the middle of the 1960s, two rival calypsonians dominated the Antiguan scene, Zemaki and Lord Canary. Their conflict was perpetuated as the King Short Shirt and Swallow rivalry during the 1970s and 1980s. In the middle of the 1980s, the Burning Flames emerged, winning the road march with \\"Styley Tight\\" in 1985. They achieved pan-Caribbean acclaim.Antigua and Barbuda's Cultural Heritage It is clear that the genre of music now called calypso had strong roots in Trinidad and Tobago, but it would be inaccurate to suggest that this music started in any one island. Every island in the Caribbean has a form of music that resembles \\"kaiso\\", more commonly referred to as calypso. It is inaccurate to attribute the origin of calypso to any island. In Belize, they call their variation punta. In Antigua they call theirs benna. Particularly in the English-speaking islands and Belize, African cultural roots have greatly influenced the beats and form of the music. All these musical forms borrow beats from West African highlife music and have fused North American pop and R&B; with the Latin beats of central and South America and Cuba to form distinct musical genres which have significant variations in islands that were influenced by the French. Zouk and cadence are other popular variations.Thompson, Dave (2002). Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , p. 225 Soca The defining staccato bass was the creation of the late Lord Shorty from Barrackpore, Trinidad and Tobago, and rose to fame as Lord Shorty with his 1963 hit \\"Clock and Dagger\\". He started out writing songs and performing in the calypso genre. In the 1970s, he began experimenting with calypso by blending it with the local chutney ‚Äî the music of Trinidad's East Indian population ‚Äî using instruments such as the sitar and tabla. The style was dubbed \\"soca\\".

Initially the monastery was built at the southern shore of a small island. After the artificial draining of Lake Sevan, which started in the era of Joseph Stalin, the water level fell about 20 metres, and the island transformed into a peninsula. At the southern shore of this newly created peninsula, a guesthouse of the Armenian Writers' Union was built. The eastern shore is occupied by the Armenian president's summer residence, while the monastery's still active seminary moved to newly constructed buildings at the northern shore of the peninsula. Due to easier accessibility (once it became a peninsula), good highway and railway connections with the Armenian capital Yerevan, a well-developed tourist industry in the nearby town of Sevan, and its picturesque location (although less picturesque than it was before the lake level drop), Sevanavank is one of the most visited tourism sights in Armenia. History According to an inscription in one of the churches, the monastery of Sevanavank was founded in 874 by Princess Mariam, the daughter of Ashot I Sergio La Porta. Monasticism and the construction of the Armenian intellectual tradition // Monasticism in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Republics / Edited by Ines Angeli Murzaku. ‚Äî Routledge, 2015. ‚Äî P. 332 \\"One of the earliest instances of a princely foundation for a monastic complex was the monastery of Sewan. Its foundation also provides the earliest explicit reference to the use of the Basilian Rule, translated in the sixth century, by an Armenian monasctic community (Garsoian 2005‚Äî7: 183). The monastery was built in 874 on the island of Sewan in Lake Sewan by Princess Mariam, daughter of Prince of Princes A≈°ot Bagratuni and widow of Prince Vasak Gabur Siwni (Pogossian 2012). Mariam's example was followed by her son Grigor Sup'an II as well as by other members of the Bagratuni royal family and princess of Siwnik'.\\" (who became a king a decade later). At the time, Armenia was still struggling to free itself from Arab rule. The monastery was strict as it was mainly intended for those monks from Etchmiadzin who had sinned. Jean-Marie Chopin, a French explorer of the Caucasus, visited there in 1830 and wrote of a regimen restraining from meat, wine, youth or women. Another explorer visited the monastery in 1850 and wrote of how manuscripts were still being copied manually. Architecture The two churches of the complex, Surp Arakelots meaning the \\"Holy Apostles\\" and Surp Astvatsatsin meaning the \\"Holy Mother of God\\", are both cruciform plan structures with octagonal tambours. The two are quite similar to each other in appearance. Adjacent are the ruins of a gavit whose roof was originally supported by six wooden columns. Some of the remains of the gavit and its columns can be seen in the Yerevan Museum of History. Reconstruction and restoration efforts took place from 1956 to 1957.

All monosaccharides are reducing sugars, along with some disaccharides, some oligosaccharides, and some polysaccharides. The monosaccharides can be divided into two groups: the aldoses, which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Ketoses must first tautomerize to aldoses before they can act as reducing sugars. The common dietary monosaccharides galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars. Disaccharides are formed from two monosaccharides and can be classified as either reducing or nonreducing. Nonreducing disaccharides like sucrose and trehalose have glycosidic bonds between their anomeric carbons and thus cannot convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group; they are stuck in the cyclic form. Reducing disaccharides like lactose and maltose have only one of their two anomeric carbons involved in the glycosidic bond, while the other is free and can convert to an open-chain form with an aldehyde group. The aldehyde functional group allows the sugar to act as a reducing agent, for example, in the Tollens' test or Benedict's test. The cyclic hemiacetal forms of aldoses can open to reveal an aldehyde, and certain ketoses can undergo tautomerization to become aldoses. However, acetals, including those found in polysaccharide linkages, cannot easily become free aldehydes. Reducing sugars react with amino acids in the Maillard reaction, a series of reactions that occurs while cooking food at high temperatures and that is important in determining the flavor of food. Also, the levels of reducing sugars in wine, juice, and sugarcane are indicative of the quality of these food products. Terminology =Oxidation-reduction= A reducing sugar is one that reduces another compound and is itself oxidized; that is, the carbonyl carbon of the sugar is oxidized to a carboxyl group. A sugar is classified as a reducing sugar only if it has an open-chain form with an aldehyde group or a free hemiacetal group. =Aldoses and ketoses= Monosaccharides which contain an aldehyde group are known as aldoses, and those with a ketone group are known as ketoses. The aldehyde can be oxidized via a redox reaction in which another compound is reduced. Thus, aldoses are reducing sugars. Sugars with ketone groups in their open chain form are capable of isomerizing via a series of tautomeric shifts to produce an aldehyde group in solution. Therefore, ketones like fructose are considered reducing sugars but it is the isomer containing an aldehyde group which is reducing since ketones cannot be oxidized without decomposition of the sugar. This type of isomerization is catalyzed by the base present in solutions which test for the presence of reducing sugars. =Reducing end= Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharides and may be either reducing or nonreducing. Even a reducing disaccharide will only have one reducing end, as disaccharides are held together by glycosidic bonds, which consist of at least one anomeric carbon. With one anomeric carbon unable to convert to the open-chain form, only the free anomeric carbon is available to reduce another compound, and it is called the reducing end of the disaccharide. A nonreducing disaccharide is that which has both anomeric carbons tied up in the glycosidic bond. Similarly, most polysaccharides have only one reducing end. Examples All monosaccharides are reducing sugars because they either have an aldehyde group (if they are aldoses) or can tautomerize in solution to form an aldehyde group (if they are ketoses). This includes common monosaccharides like galactose, glucose, glyceraldehyde, fructose, ribose, and xylose. Many disaccharides, like cellobiose, lactose, and maltose, also have a reducing form, as one of the two units may have an open-chain form with an aldehyde group. However, sucrose and trehalose, in which the anomeric carbons of the two units are linked together, are nonreducing disaccharides since neither of the rings is capable of opening. Equilibrium between cyclic and open-chain form in one ring of maltose In glucose polymers such as starch and starch-derivatives like glucose syrup, maltodextrin and dextrin the macromolecule begins with a reducing sugar, a free aldehyde. When starch has been partially hydrolyzed the chains have been split and hence it contains more reducing sugars per gram. The percentage of reducing sugars present in these starch derivatives is called dextrose equivalent (DE). Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of glucose that serves as the main form of carbohydrate storage in animals. It is a reducing sugar with only one reducing end, no matter how large the glycogen molecule is or how many branches it has (note, however, that the unique reducing end is usually covalently linked to glycogenin and will therefore not be reducing). Each branch ends in a nonreducing sugar residue. When glycogen is broken down to be used as an energy source, glucose units are removed one at a time from the nonreducing ends by enzymes. Characterization Several qualitative tests are used to detect the presence of reducing sugars. Two of them use solutions of copper(II) ions: Benedict's reagent (Cu2+ in aqueous sodium citrate) and Fehling's solution (Cu2+ in aqueous sodium tartrate). The reducing sugar reduces the copper(II) ions in these test solutions to copper(I), which then forms a brick red copper(I) oxide precipitate. Reducing sugars can also be detected with the addition of Tollen's reagent, which consist of silver ions (Ag+) in aqueous ammonia. When Tollen's reagent is added to an aldehyde, it precipitates silver metal, often forming a silver mirror on clean glassware. 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid is another test reagent, one that allows quantitative detection. It reacts with a reducing sugar to form 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid, which can be measured by spectrophotometry to determine the amount of reducing sugar that was present. Sugars having acetal or ketal linkages are not reducing sugars, as they do not have free aldehyde chains. They therefore do not react with any of the reducing-sugar test solutions. However, a non-reducing sugar can be hydrolyzed using dilute hydrochloric acid. After hydrolysis and neutralization of the acid, the product may be a reducing sugar that gives normal reactions with the test solutions. All carbohydrates respond positively to Molisch's reagent but the test has a faster rate when it comes to monosaccharides. Importance in medicine Fehling's solution was used for many years as a diagnostic test for diabetes, a disease in which blood glucose levels are dangerously elevated by a failure to produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or by an inability to respond to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Measuring the amount of oxidizing agent (in this case, Fehling's solution) reduced by glucose makes it possible to determine the concentration of glucose in the blood or urine. This then enables the right amount of insulin to be injected to bring blood glucose levels back into the normal range. Importance in food chemistry =Maillard reaction= The carbonyl groups of reducing sugars react with the amino groups of amino acids in the Maillard reaction, a complex series of reactions that occurs when cooking food. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are diverse; some are beneficial to human health, while others are toxic. However, the overall effect of the Maillard reaction is to decrease the nutritional value of food. One example of a toxic product of the Mailard reaction is acrylamide, a neurotoxin and possible carcinogen that is formed from free asparagine and reducing sugars when cooking starchy foods at high temperatures (above 120¬∞C). =Food quality= The level of reducing sugars in wine, juice, and sugarcane are indicative of the quality of these food products, and monitoring the levels of reducing sugars during food production has improved market quality. The conventional method for doing so is the Lane-Eynon method, which involves titrating the reducing sugar with copper(II) in Fehling's solution in the presence of methylene blue, a common redox indicator. However, it is inaccurate, expensive, and sensitive to impurities.

It is a part of Wairakei, the largest geothermal field in New Zealand, with a surface area of about 25 km2, which lies in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The name springs from the many hydrothermal eruption craters, which are in part barren and which have bright colours. Combined with the numerous steam vents, constantly shifting, collapsing and reforming giving the whole area desolate appearance, and the sulphur smell, the whole area has an ‚Äúunearthly‚Äù atmosphere. The craters are a relatively recent feature of the area and appeared as a result of human activity in the region. The site is Crown Land, administered by the Department of Conservation, with help from the Craters of the Moon Trust, a volunteer organisation that provides information for visitors and passive vehicle security. Steam vents at Craters of the Moon History In 1859 Ferdinand von Hochstetter, an Austrian geologist who traveled through the area, reported a colossal column of steam from the Karapiti Blowhole (fumarole), observable from about 20 km away. It was difficult to approach because steam vents and springs covered the valley floor and the ground was warm, soft, iron-stained clay for great distances around.Mongillo 2003, p. 2 By the beginning of the 20th century the Blowhole was a tourist attraction, albeit not of the level of the nearby Wairakei Geyser Valley.see for instance the extract from: Grimshaw, Beatrice (1908)‚Äì In the strange South Seas, London (especially pp. 8-10), which gives a detailed account of a visit to the region, and the photo of tourists observing the Blowhole at Alexander Turnbull Library It's worthwhile reading the ‚ÄúImpression of a Trip‚Äù in 1927, in which the Karapiti Blowhole is named ‚Äúthe safety valve of the North Island‚Äù: :‚ÄùAfter dinner (which was served at 6 p.m.) we took our seats in the car which went to Karapeeti (the safety valve of the North Island) and the ‚ÄúHuka‚Äù falls, a little higher up the Waikato. :Karapeeti blow hole is an escaping volume of superheated steam with a pressure of 180 lbs. to the square inch coming through an aperture two feet by one foot. The guide lit a sack sprinkled with kerosene so that the visitors could see the escaping steam in the darkness and after the sack had partly burnt away he picked it up on a stick and shook the burning pieces down into the blow hole. These were immediately carried up in the jet of steam and presented a very weird fireworks effect, the sparks remaining alight, proving that it was super-heated or dry steam. This blow hole, according to Maori tradition, has been constant for the last 200 years and the Maoris of the early days of New Zealand used this column of steam as a beacon to guide them with their canoes across Lake Taupo which is six miles distant.‚ÄùGrapes, W.H.H.

Then the ‚Äújet, filled with smoke and burning shreds becomes a whirling inverted cone flashing with thousands of yellow sparks in a brilliant pyrotechnic display‚Äù.leaflet of the New Zealand Department of Tourist and Health Resorts ‚Äì Hotel Wairakei, ‚Äúthe waters of adorning‚Äù (ca. 1950‚Äì1954). See also: What to see and do at Wairakei - 1953 In 1950 the area was described as being mostly warm clay with small patches of hot ground and mudpools. ‚ÄúThe Karapiti Blowhole was still impressive, though apparently much less intense than when Hochstetter saw it‚Äù. A most important change in the region has been the building of the Wairakei Power Station (150 MW) in the 1950s, about 2 km. north of the field. This reduced the pressure in the hot water systems below the earth surface. Since then much of the geothermal activity in the region has dramatically changed, as did the geothermal activity at Craters of the Moon. The geysers at Wairakei Geyser Valley totally disappeared, but the heat output at Craters of the Moon increased. A lot of hydrothermal eruptions occurred, which formed the craters. In 1950, the total heat output at Craters of the Moon was about 40 MW (megawatts). By 1958, it had increased to about 90 MW. In 1964 it was 420 MW. After 1964 the output declined to about 220 MW in 1979. The most recent estimate being about 200 MW in 2000.Mongillo 2003, p. 3 Heat output from the Karapiti Blowhole followed a similar pattern. In the 1950 it was 12 MW. It increased to a maximum of about 38 MW during the mid 1960s. Then it dropped to about 7 MW in 1978. The blowhole finally ceased altogether in 1987. Features of Craters of the Moon Geothermal eruption crater Colourful border of crater Craters of the Moon is a steamfield with a total of about of heated ground. It has an average altitude of 435 m.Given 1980, p. 2 It has ‚Äì of course ‚Äì craters, but it also has fumaroles (‚Äúblowholes‚Äù) and a mudpool. Vegetation around the area of the Craters of the Moon is quite uncommon. =Craters= All the craters at The Craters of the Moon are the result of hydrothermal eruptions. The pressure of the steam beneath the surface exceeds the pressure exerted by the weight of the overlying ground. This results in an explosion. A mixture of hot water, steam, hot mud and pumice is ejected into the air. Material may be blown up to 100 m, leaving behind holes or craters as deep as 20 m. Hydrothermal eruptions occur about once a year. =Fumaroles= The openings in the earth surface, where geothermal steam and gases are emitted, are called fumaroles. These vary in size from one centimetre to half a meter in diameter. The most powerful fumarole observed at Craters of the Moon occurred December 1967. It had a heat output of 116 MW.Mongillo 2003, p. 5 =Mudpool= Currently, only one of the craters has a mudpool. Here the gases (mainly H2S) react with water to form sulphuric acid. This reacts with the rocks, turning it to clay. When there is water present, this forms the grey coloured mudpools ‚Äúthat bubble and burp as steam and gas escape through them‚Äù.Mongillo 2003, p. 6 Vegetation Much of the ground at Craters of the Moon is warm or hot. This of course affects the vegetation. Only few species can survive. One is the prostrate kanuka, a variety of kanuka (Kunzea ericoides var. microflora). Other species include ferns and mosses that usually grow only in the tropics or warmer frost-free climates.Given 1980 Visitor access to Craters of the Moon Crater with steaming ground and fumaroles Craters of the Moon is open to visitors all year round. The area is easily reached by car from Taupo, being on the end of Karapiti Road, that branches off State Highway 1/5, 4 km north of Taupo. There is a carpark, and an information kiosk at the entrance. An entrance fee applies. Visitors can walk a main track circuit, suited for people of all ages and fitness levels, which is also wheelchair accessible. This loop takes 45 minutes to walk. A steeper loop, taking an additional 20 minutes, climbs to a viewing point. Due to the somewhat poisonous fumes and the fact that ground temperatures around steam vents can reach dangerous levels, the paths and board walkways that allow access to the field are relaid at irregular intervals to bypass them. Craters of the Moon Trust In 1991 the constant break-ins in cars at the rather isolated car park caused local solicitor Jeremy Nash to seek volunteers to maintain passive security. In that same year a first kiosk was built near the entrance. In 2000 a bigger kiosk was opened. In 2000 the Trust opened a similar kiosk and passive vehicle security at the famous Huka Falls.

Well separated from higher peaks by large, low basins, Charleston Peak is the most topographically prominent peak in Nevada, and the eighth-most-prominent peak in the contiguous United States., It is one of eight ultra-prominent peaks in Nevada. It is located about northwest of Las Vegas within the Mount Charleston Wilderness, which is within the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area of the Humboldt‚ÄìToiyabe National Forest. Overview Mount Charleston is a year- round getaway for Las Vegas's residents and visitors, with a number of hiking trails and a modest ski area. The mountain, which is snow-capped more than half the year, can be seen from parts of the Las Vegas Strip when looking toward the west. Mount Charleston has nearly 200 camp sites and over 150 picnic areas, some of which are RV-accessible. The village of Mount Charleston, Nevada, lies at its base to the east. The state of Nevada issues license plates with the caption \\"Mt. Charleston\\" and an image of the peak in the background. Sales of the plate supports the natural environment of the Mount Charleston area through grants administered by the Nevada Division of State Lands. According to the Federal Writers' Project, Mount Charleston was named for Charleston, South Carolina by Southern sympathizers. Plane crash Near its summit are the remnants of a 1955 plane crash. A CIA C-54 Military Air Transport Service plane crashed near the peak on November 17, 1955 during a blizzard. The plane was on route from Burbank (location of Lockheed‚Äôs Skunkworks), to Groom Lake (or Watertown Strip as it was also known in those days) to work on the secret U-2 plane development. Fourteen men (a mix of military staffers and civilian subcontractors, engineers, and technicians) were on board when it crashed, all of whom perished. There are still remains from the plane that can be hiked to just off the main southern loop trail to the peak. A memorial featuring a propeller from the downed aircraft (which was recovered decades after the crash from the crash site) was installed at the Spring Mountains Visitor Gateway in 2015. It was Nevada's first national memorial and the first on U.S. Forest Service land.  Hiking  The start of the South Loop Trail to Charleston Peak Charleston Peak is a popular destination for hikers. The summit offers panoramic views from the Sierra Nevada, Death Valley, and Las Vegas. There are two well-marked and well- maintained trails to the summit: South Loop Trail and North Loop Trail. The trails can be done on their own as an out-and-back hike, or combined as a loop. Both approaches involve a strenuous 16-mile+ round trip with over 4000 feet of climbing. The hike often takes all day. The hike is most accessible in the snow-free months of summer and fall.

As well as the main characters making clear their thoughts and attitudes towards him, his own colleague PC Terry Hoskins reveals that even his peers in the police service despise him, and Slater admits during the episode to having arrested his own father in the past, alienating him from his family. =\\"To Hull and Back\\"= Slater is the main antagonist in \\"To Hull and Back\\", his involvement in crime is the main focus of the storyline, with the Trotters becoming involved in a diamond smuggling operation part-headed - unbeknownst to them - by Slater. His position of authority within the police has been exploited a number of times to successfully smuggle diamonds into England, and over the course of the episode he almost succeeds again, only to be foiled by Hoskins who drives him into a sting and lands Slater with a five-year prison sentence. =\\"The Class of '62\\"= Slater's final appearance in character was in \\"The Class of '62\\", in which he has been paroled from prison and returns to Peckham, setting up a school reunion to which Del, Boycie, Trigger, and Denzil are invited, with Rodney joining them. Over the course of the episode, it is learnt that Del's partner Raquel is Slater's ex-wife, and the school reunion was merely a set-up to gain contact with her regarding his divorce proceedings, as he knew from the start that she was living with Del. It is also revealed that Slater has returned to the illegal diamond trade, which Del and Rodney use to blackmail Slater into giving Raquel a fair divorce, leaving her alone and leaving Peckham for good, under the threat of them informing the police about Slater's return to crime. This prompts Slater's departure from the series. NB. Slater appears once more in the series but not in a character appearance, in the final episode \\"Sleepless in Peckham\\" when Del and Rodney are given an old photograph of the very first Jolly Boys' outing from 1960, in which Slater is pictured. The first Jolly Boys' Outing forms part of the storyline of the prequel series Rock & Chips, which features a young Slater.  Rock & Chips  A young Slater is shown in the prequel series Rock & Chips, played by Calum MacNab. Slater is initially shown as a prefect at school, attempting to be authoritative against Del and his gang but ultimately being spurned by both the gang and his superiors from whom he attempts to gain acceptance. He is part of the first Jolly Boys' Outing as noted at the end of Sleepless in Peckham, in which he is tricked into taking drugs and passes out before they reach their destination. Over the course of the series he joins the police cadets and attempts to arrest Del and Jumbo Mills in the market for selling illegally imported records. He takes them to the station, only to be denied a bona fide arrest and snubbed by his superior Sgt Foster, who also lets Del and Jumbo off with a warning and seizes their records.

British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL), incorporated on 31 October 1969, was the railway systems engineering subsidiary of British Rail until the design and building of trains in the UK was privatised in 1989. BREL was purchased by the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri (40%), Trafalgar House (40%) and a management-employee buy-out (20%). It has since become part of Bombardier Transportation. Products =Diesels= =Electrics= =Multiple units= BREL also produced some railbuses. =Coaches= =Main products= The InterCity 125 is the world's fastest diesel train The vast majority of BREL's output was rolling stock for British Rail, including Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages, the latter for locomotive haulage and InterCity 125 diesel High Speed Trains. BREL built the NIR 80 Class diesel-electric multiple units for Northern Ireland Railways. Other Mark 3 derived vehicles included Class 150 diesel multiple units in the 1980s and numerous electric multiple units such as Classes 313 and 317. BREL had limited success in the export market, notably with Mark 2 and Mark 3 carriages for Irish Rail and the Taiwan Railway EMU100 series. =Other products= Crewe in October 2006 Class 210 diesel-electric multiple unit at Reading on 30 May 1982 on the type's first passenger service. BREL built prototypes such as the Class 210 DEMU and the experimental high-speed Advanced Passenger Train (APT) tilting train during the 1970s and early 1980s. The Class 210 were externally very similar to the first batch of Class 317 EMUs, but half of the forward carriage was taken up by the engine room, where an above-floor diesel engine drove a generator to power traction motors on the axles. Locations BREL's major production centres were at Crewe (Crewe Works), Derby (Derby Litchurch Lane Works and Derby Works), Doncaster (Doncaster Works), Glasgow (Glasgow (St Rollox) Works), Shildon (Shildon Works) and York (BREL York). The historic site at Wolverton in Milton Keynes was progressively run down until the 1980s before being relegated to maintenance duties. Not all British Rail rolling stock was built in-house: Metro Cammell, Brush Traction and Metropolitan-Vickers amongst others manufactured rolling stock, although in general it was built to BREL specifications. Latterly, BREL often acted as a subcontractor to a main contractor such as GEC, which supplied traction equipment. These contracts required BREL to build the frames, body shells and bogies, and install the traction and ancillary equipment of the primary contractor. Much of the electric locomotive construction programme of the 1980s, such as Classes 87, 90 and 91, was carried out in this way. Privatisation In 1989 BREL was purchased by the Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri (40%), Trafalgar House (40%) and a management-employee buy-out (20%). In 1992 it was bought out by ABB to form ABB Transportation Ltd.Industrial Railway Society Bulletin No 544, January 1993 It has since become part of Bombardier Transportation. In 1996, BREL York closed. In 2005 the Metro-Cammell plant in Washwood Heath, Birmingham closed which meant that for ten years from 2005 to 2015 Bombardier's former BREL site, the Derby Litchurch Lane Works, was the sole plant in the UK actively manufacturing stock. This unique role was ended by Hitachi and John Laing in 2015 when they opened the new Agility Trains factory in County Durham.

It was the first album released by the band's label A-F Records.  Background  It is a reprint of the nine Anti-Flag songs available on their split album North America Sucks, plus 10 unreleased tracks. The first 10 songs were recorded during the Die for the Government sessions in the spring of 1996. Only 1000 copies of the split were released originally, and the band was unable to press anymore. As a result, they decided to rerelease the songs themselves due to the overwhelming requests from fans. As an added bonus for the fans, they decided to include rare songs from the band's first shows at WRUW in Cleveland, OH in 1994 and 1995. These are the last songs to feature Andy Flag on vocals and bass, as he left after the release of the split. By the time the album was released, the band had grown to include Chris Head on guitar and Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns on bass.  Song Info  I Can't Stand Being with You attacks the narrator's former friend who has betrayed their ideals and values to become \\"a pop culture whore\\". The song was influenced by a quote from Jello Biofra, \\"You became the one you set out to destroy\\". The title track is a politically charged track in vein with the band's other works, attacking the people who blindly follow the government and media's rules and advice without being their own person. We've Got His Gun is an anti-gun track written by Andy about a friend who accidently killed himself with his father's gun. Born to Die describes young kids struggling in bad circumstances. It was apparently seen by some right-wing fans as endorsing suicide, which led Justin to include a note in the album booklet disputing that view and explaining \\"This song is a statement about the pressures of society...which push many youth to the point of hopelessness.\\" The Truth attacks the media for their role in the Persian Gulf War, while You'll Scream Tonight additionally attacks the sexism and propaganda on television. The song is one of the more unique songs in Anti-Flag's catalog, being much slower and darker than their other songs during this time. Indie Sux is a joke track that mocks the stereotypes in the Indie, Hardline, and Emo communities. Justin wrote a note explaining that the song \\"was written in good fun\\". He went on to explain that the lines about hardline punks were the only serious part of the song, as he did not support the \\"jock-like\\" attitudes they had towards people who didn't support them. Anti-Violent is about artists who mutilate themselves, use steroids, and hit on young girls. The song 20 Years of Hell was an unreleased track recorded during the same sessions as the other songs. Justin described the song as being about his friends going through rough times and struggling. I'm Having a Good Day is another joke track. Many of the remaining songs were included in two of the band's demos released in 1994 and 1995. I Don't Want to Be Like You is a live version of the same song featured on the band's first split, Rockin With Father Mike. Betty Sue Is Dead was also featured on their first demo, and describes a woman who was killed in 1953 because she was bisexual. A studio version of I'm Feeling Slightly Violent was released on the compilation album, Iron City Punk.  Release  Instead of releasing the album on another label, the band decided to form their own record label to release it, A-F Records.The band would go on to use the label as an opportunity to showcase different Pittsburgh punk bands. The band would also use it to release their next album, A New Kind of Army and various subsequent releases.

The highway links the Pacific Highway (A1/B83) and Pacific Motorway (M1) at Pearces Corner, Wahroonga in the northeast with the Hume Highway (A22/A28) at Liverpool in the southwest. The entire length of Cumberland Highway is designated route A28. The name of the highway is derived from the Cumberland Plain and Cumberland County. The name Cumberland was conferred on the County by Governor Phillip in honour of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland. History The Cumberland Highway and Pennant Hills Road overhead road sign north-eastbound at . The original western Sydney Bypass was Ring Road 5, which ran from the Pacific Highway and the Hume Highway with Parramatta in between. In 1974, Ring Road 5 was superseded by State Route 55. The growth of Sydney's west had instead turned it into a primary arterial with huge increase in freight traffic. =Metroad 7= In August 1988, the highway was finally completed to supersede the Church Street/Woodville Road route as the major connection between the Pacific and Hume Highways. The highway was named \\"Cumberland Highway\\" after completion. State Route 77 was proclaimed and allocated to the entire length of the highway. Metroad 7 replaced State Route 77 in June 1993 and the highway was designated by the Federal Government as an interim National Highway in 1994 until the completion of Westlink M7. When Metroad 7 was introduced, it went along Heathcote Road to the then Metroad 1 (now A1) at . The southern section of Heathcote Road was replaced by the then Metroad 6 (now A6) in 1998, and Metroad 7 was therefore truncated to the end of Cumberland Highway at Liverpool. Since 1994, various parts of the Cumberland Highway were upgraded which included the widening of Pennant Hills Road. With the opening of the Westlink M7 motorway in December 2005, the Metroad 7 route south of M2 Hills Motorway was decommissioned and rerouted onto the Westlink M7, leaving only the section north of the M2 Hills Motorway to retain the Metroad 7 route marker. The Metroad 6 was extended northwards from Carlingford to join M2 Hills Motorway at the same time. This was the condition it had stayed until 2013. With the introduction of alphanumeric routes in New South Wales, the entire Cumberland Highway was allocated the A28 route in May‚ÄìJune 2013 and Metroad 7 was completely decommissioned. =Future developments= The NorthConnex, presently under construction with an expected completion date of 2019, will link the M2 Hills Motorway at with the Pacific Highway and Pacific Motorway at Wahroonga via a motorway tunnel that aims to reduce congestion and improve traffic flow along the Pennant Hills Road section of the Cumberland Highway.

Though geographically Melanesian, the music of Fiji is more Polynesian in character. Nevertheless, Fijian folk styles are distinct in their fusion of Polynesian and Melanesian traditions. Folk music is dominated by vocal church music, as well as dances characterized by rich and dull harmony and complex percussion made from slit drums or natural materials, like drums! Folk music Fijian music band at arrivals hall of Nadi International airport Like their Polynesian neighbours, modern Fijians play guitar, ukulele and mandolin along with a variety of indigenous instruments, most commonly lali drums, which are now used to call the people of an area together. Lali drums were an important part of traditional Fijian culture, used as a form of communication to announce births, deaths and wars. A smaller form of the lali drum (lali ni meke) is used as a form in instrumentation. Meke is a kind of spiritual folk dance, in which dancers bodies are said to be possessed by spirits. Other percussion instruments include the derua, which are tubes made of bamboo which are stamped on mats or on the ground. Other dances included the women's dele, which humiliated enemy prisoners sex, and the men's cibi, which uses spears and clubs . Indo-Fijian music Indian music draws heavily from rural North Indian and some of the Southern states in India. Most popular are Bhajans - a devotional music based accompanied by harmonium and dholak (drums). Many Indians now also export bhajan CDs for large Fiji Indian diaspora in Canada, United States, Australia and New Zealand. Jazz too, has become increasingly popular as cultural horizons have broadened. =Qawaali= According to Qawaali/Ghazal singer Ustad Sheikh Mohyudean (August 1, 1920 ‚Äì January 1, 2015) and Indian Classical musician Cassius Khan, the Qawaali has undergone a major transformation in Fiji. Because of the lack of classically trained tabla players who came to Fiji in the late 1900s, after their demise, some qawaali musicians started playing with dholak players who only knew how to accompany the Bhajan, and therefore incorporated a new style of music. When the trend caught on, some Bhajan singers also tried their voices in qawaali, and brought Bihari elements into the music known as \\"Phagua gayaki\\" an ancient bhajan singing style in Bihar, India. The classical qawaali style slowly took a back seat to this new style of singing, but has been snubbed by purists because of its non connection to qawaali. The word Qawaali means \\"utterance in the name of Allah.\\" Qawaali in Fiji is rhythmically more challenging with a firm emphasis on percussion rather than the more traditional aspect which focuses on lyrics. =Ghazal and Thumri= Mushtari Begum (Dec 25th 1934‚ÄìMarch 14, 2004) was the first Indian Ghazal/Thumri exponent from Lucknow, India who resided in Fiji. She was a disciple of her father Ustad Amjad Ali, a Thumri exponent. She later learned in India from greats such as Ustad Faiyaz Khan and Shamla Bhave of Bangalore, India. Her extraordinary vocal capabilities in her voice ranged close to 4 octaves and in her prime, quickly ruled the charts of Fiji's music industry. In her career she won 36 trophies and numerous recognitions and awards between 1947 and 1973. She was awarded the title \\"Malika-e-Ghazal\\" or Queen of Ghazal by the Indian High Consulate in 1973. Internationally renowned star tabla player and ghazal wizard Cassius Khan ( June 7, 1974- ) born in Lautoka, Fiji has collaborated with some great world musicians and is the only known musician in the world who plays tabla and sings ghazals simultaneously. The senior disciple of the late Mushtari Begum, he is currently based in Vancouver, is recognized as one of the treasures of Canada as he has received the \\"Salute to Excellence\\" Award, and has many albums to his credit. Khan also made history as the first ever Indian Classical Ghazal/Tabla player who performed at the SXSW Festival in Austin Texas in 2008, and again at the Canada Music Week Festival in Toronto, Canada in 2009. One of his collaborations received a Juno Award in 2007. Khan also runs the Mushtari Begum Festival of Indian Classical Music and Dance in his hometown New Westminster, BC, Canada, which debuted in 2012. =Dholak music= Notable Dholak player Sashi Roy is one of the leading exponents of Dholak playing who was born in Nadi, Fiji. He has incorporated a new technique of playing the \\"dholak tarang\\" style- playing multiple dholaks tuned in different notes in unison and is one of the most recognized soloists in this art form. He is currently residing in Edmonton, Canada.In contemporary times, Shailendra Prakash Sharma is particularly acclaimed in this artform. He has performed with a range of artists (local and from Bollywood) during concerts, and also played in a number of locally produced albums especially in fiji bhajan and fiji kirtan. Popular music In the 1980s, Fijian performers like Laisa Vulakoro and Lagani Rabukawaqa became pan-Pacific stars. Vulakoro is especially well known for her part in creating \\"vude\\", a popular style that combines disco, country and island music (especially the meke rhythm) and rock and roll.Fijian Music Other modern performers include the bands Nuku Katudrau, Karuna Gopalan, Rosiloa (Black Rose), Danny Costello,Daniel Rae's Website Michelle Rounds, Seru Serevi The Freelancers.Culture of Music and Emosi Lomata who is well known across Fiji for his ongoing compositions and album releases over 30 years since the age of 11, recently performing in Australia in October 2008 with his band JES4P's.

It is one of the four largest newspapers in Taiwan, along with the Liberty Times, Apple Daily and United Daily News. The paper is also printed in San Gabriel, California. China Television (CTV) and Chung T'ien Television (CtiTV) are both under the ownership of the Want Want China Times Group. History The China Times was founded in February 1950 under the name Credit News (), and focused mainly on price indices. The name changed on January 1, 1960 to Credit Newspaper (), a daily with comprehensive news coverage. Color printing was introduced on March 29, 1968, the first newspaper in Asia to make the move. On September 1, 1968, the name changed once again to China Times, presently based in the Wanhua District, Taipei. The founder, Yu Jizhong (), died in 2002, leaving the presidency of the paper to his second son, Yu Jianxin (). Yu Jizhong's eldest daughter, Yu Fanying, is the vice president. The bureau chief is Lin Shengfen (), the general manager Huang Zhaosong (), and the chief editor Huang Qinglong (). In 2008, the China Times Group was sold to the Want Want Holdings Limited, the largest rice cake manufacturer in Taiwan. The China Times Publishing Company was the first publishing company in Taiwan to publicly issue shares. China Times once managed a Taiwan-based baseball team, the China Times Eagles, but a betting scandal dissolved the team seven years into its operation. The China Times Group has set up several charity organizations (Chinatimes Foundation and China Times Cultural Foundation). In November 2019 William Wang, a Chinese spy who defected to Australia, claimed that Want Want China Times Group channels CTV and CTi-TV had received Chinese funding in return for airing stories unfavorable of the Taiwanese government.

It has since been criticized of being \\"very biased\\" in favor of positive news about China. In a 2020 interview with Stand News, an anonymous Times journalist described the editorial stance of the paper as having changed completely after Tsai's acquisition. The interviewed journalist said the newspaper mandated the use of vocabulary that supports the PRC's positions on Taiwan, and prevented its reporters from covering topics that may be seen as against China, such as issues involving the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Tsai himself has openly admitted to airing commercials from PRC authorities. Before Tsai Eng-Meng bought it, The political position of the China Times had been slanted towards the pan-blue coalition (pro-unification), although it was considered more moderate than the United Daily News. Relations with the Kuomintang nationalist government have in the past been close, but when the China Times U.S. Edition ceased publication after the Chiang Nan Murder Case in October 1984, the China Times broke with then KMT president Chiang Ching-kuo in protest. Since the 1980s, the China Times has developed a more liberal and pro-democratic stance, often concerned with progressive issues such as social justice or environmental concerns. During the 1990s, the China Times was often supportive of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, more on the grounds of liberalism rather than Taiwanese Independence. China Television (CTV) used to be owned by the Kuomintang and was sold to the China Times group in 2006. Controversies =Financial Times lawsuit= In 2019, Want Want China Times Media Group filed defamation claims against the Financial Times and announced the intent to file defamation claims against any news organization that cited the Financial Times report. The Financial Times report claimed that the China Times and fellow Want Want Media Group company CtiTV were taking daily instruction from China‚Äôs Taiwan Affairs Office. Reporters Without Borders called the lawsuit a \\"an abusive libel suit‚Äù and accused Want Want of harassing an experienced journalist.

Gitler first used the term on the liner notes for Soultrane (1958).Porter 1999, p. 319. Style Coltrane, a saxophonist, employed extremely dense improvisational yet patterned lines consisting of high speed arpeggios and scale patterns played in rapid succession: hundreds of notes running from the lowest to highest registers.Porter 1999, p. 111. The lines are often faster than sixteenth notes, consisting of quintuplets, septuplets, etc., and can sound like glissandos. Coltrane invented this style while playing with Thelonious Monk and developed it further when he returned to Miles Davis' group. Both Coltrane and Davis facilitated a free atmosphere whereby Coltrane was able to experiment on the bandstand. Vertical approach Coltrane used the \\"sheets of sound\\" lines to liquidise and loosen the strict chords, modes, and harmonies of Hard Bop, whilst still adhering to them (at this stage in his musical development).Coltrane 1960 Playing with the Miles Davis groups, in particular, gave Coltrane the free musical space in which to apply harmonic ideas to stacked chords and substitutions.Porter 1999, p. 160. Coltrane states; \\"In fact, due to the direct and free-flowing lines of his [Davis's] music, I found it easy to apply the harmonic ideas that I had. I could stack up chords-say, on a C7, I sometimes superimposed an Eb7, up to an F#7, [resolving] down to an F. That way I could play three chords on one...\\" Further, this open approach allowed Coltrane to arpeggiate three chords simultaneously, a style Monk initially taught Coltrane. The \\"three-on-one chord approach\\" gave the music a fluid, sweeping sound that was harmonically vertical. Concepts of vertical (chordal) versus horizontal (melody) are key ideas in the work of George Russell, whom Coltrane had recorded with in September 1958.Porter 1999, p. 160. This approach reflected Coltrane's fascination with third relations. Sometimes he used diminished chords, other times he used augmented chords. At times, Coltrane might use scales or licks in the passing keys instead of arpeggios. Coltrane employed these harmonic ideas during his \\"sheets of sound\\" stage in 1958. At other times, he would simply play rapid patterns of diminished-scales.Porter 1999, p. 161. Usage The \\"sheets of sound\\" approach can be heard as early as the 1957 collaboration with Monk in solos like the one on \\"Trinkle, Tinkle\\" from the album Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane. Coltrane's live performance of \\"If I Were a Bell\\" with the Miles Davis sextet on September 9, 1958, well exemplifies his use of the \\"sheets of sound\\" during this stage of his career. In \\"Trane on the Track\\", an article published on October 16, 1958 in Down Beat magazine, Coltrane spoke to Ira Gitler about the sheets of sound, telling him, \\"Now it is not a thing of beauty, and the only way it would be justified is if it becomes that.

A crash bar (also known as a panic exit device, panic bar, or push bar)American National Standards Institute, ANSI/BHMA A156.3-2001, American National Standard for Exit DevicesCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 24, Part 2, \\"California Building Code.\\" 1008.1.9 is a type of door opening mechanism which allows users to open a door by pushing a bar. While originally conceived as a way to prevent crowd crushing in an emergency, crash bars are now used as the primary door opening mechanism in many commercial buildings. The device consists of a spring-loaded metal bar which is fixed horizontally to a door that swings in the direction of an exit. Depressing the bar unlatches the door, allowing occupants to quickly leave the building. Modern fire standards often mandate that doors be fitted with crash bars in commercial and other occupancies where mass evacuation may be slowed by other types of door openers. They are sometimes intended solely for emergency use and may be fitted with alarms. However, in many buildings the crash bar functions as the primary mechanism for opening a door in normal circumstances as well. They may even be used when not required by code because they are quicker and easier for users compared with a knob or lever handle. Background Crash bar doors in a school, with upper vertical rod latches = History = Following the events of the Victoria Hall disaster in Sunderland, England in 1883 in which 183 children died because a door had been bolted at the bottom of a stairwell, the British government began legal moves to enforce minimum standards for building safety. This slowly led to the legal requirement that venues must have a minimum number of outward opening doors as well as locks which could be opened from the inside. Motivated by the Sunderland disaster, Robert Alexander Briggs (1868‚Äì1963) invented the panic bolt which was granted a UK patent on 13 August 1892. However these moves were not globally copied. For example, in the United States, at least 602 people died in the Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago in December 1903 because iron gates blocked exits. Five years later 174 people in Ohio died in the Collinwood school fire, which led to a national outcry in the U.S. for greater fire safety in buildings. On 31 December 1929, some 37 years after the panic bolt was patented, 71 children died during the Glen Cinema disaster at a Hogmanay film screening in Paisley, Renfrewshire when a smoking film canister sparked panic. Children rushing to escape the cinema became crushed against the padlocked exit doors. Even after a police officer broke a padlock, the inward-opening doors were held shut by the mass of bodies behind them. = Justification for Use = By the end of the 20th century, most countries had building codes (or regulations) which require all public buildings have a minimum number of fire and emergency exits. Crash bars are fitted to these types of doors because they are proven to save lives in the event of human crushes. Panic can often occur during mass building evacuations caused by fires or explosions. In the event emergency exits are required, the crash bar works efficiently to allow people to pass through security doors without a reduction in speed. A crash bar's fast-acting mechanism reduces the risk that a rushing crowd might suddenly become a logjam at the exits. Such a human stampede, which has many historical precedents, can cause falls, crushing, and other injury because the rear of a crowd has no idea that the people at the front of a crowd have come across a door. Crash bars are typically found on doors which are required emergency exits serving a particular type or quantity of occupants. Common locations include doors which provide egress from assembly areas, doors which serve many occupants, or doors serving hazardous areas. For buildings subject to the International Building Code, or a locally adopted variation, they are required for certain healthcare, education, or assembly spaces, generally related to the number of occupants exiting through a given door.  Latching  Vertical rod vs center post latchingMechanical Types Crash bars offer numerous configurations for latching to the door frame. Vertical rods can be affixed to crash bars allowing both doors to be opened with no center clearance obstruction. When the bar is depressed, a chord within the vertical rod gets pulled, which lowers a latch at the top and/or bottom and allows the door to open. The Pullman latch, which attaches to a Pullman keeper, is the locking mechanism usually used at the ends of the vertical rods. More expensive products may feature vertical rods and latches concealed within the door. Diagram of Vertical Rod Latching Elements Some jurisdictions permit doors to latch to each other. For security, additional latching points may be added. For example, upper and lower vertical rods added to one door and connected to the leaf with no rods via a mortice latch. A double door coordinator is used to ensure the active leaf does not close before the inactive leaf. This configuration is not recommended for high traffic locations Center posts are an alternative to vertical rods at double door exits. This offers less clearance because the post remains in the middle when both doors are open. That said, the post can often be removed with a key for occasions when items larger than a single door need to pass through. Center posts may be preferred over vertical rods because they have fewer moving parts, thus they have fewer components that can break. Push bars themselves are some of the most reliable door opening mechanisms. To pass CE certification, bars must function between 100,000 and 500,000 opening cycles depending on the rating the manufacturer is seeking. Some brands have exceeded these requirements and tested their products to over one million opening cycles. = Unlocking and Latch Hold (Dogging) = In some applications, such as storefront entrances, panic bars may be dogged during business hours. Dogging is a common feature on panic bars in which the bar is retracted with a key‚Äîfreeing the door to swing without latching. This allows customers to apply force to any portion of the door, not just the bar, in order to open it. Dogging is distinct from simple unlocking, which permits the user to open the door from both ends but still requires performing an action to release the latches. However, in applications where the exterior side contains an immovable dummy handle, as opposed to a knob or lever handle, it is usually impossible to unlock the crash bar without also dogging it. Dogging can extend the life of the bar. Some bars can be unlocked /dogged electronically, while others take a cylinder lock, hex key, or contain no key functionality at all. Dogging should be avoided in high wind areas where the door is susceptible to blowing open. Doors with Electromagnetic Exit Bars = Electric Strike = Unlike a traditional crash bar, this type contains a horizontal touch sensor and no moving parts. When the sensor is pressed, it releases an electromagnetic lock. It may be used in tandem with a motion sensor which unlocks for anyone who stands in front of the door. This type of release must still unlock in the event of a power failure, and in some jurisdictions the door must automatically unlock for a fire alarm activation. Because these will not function in a long term power outage, they are most commonly used on secondary doors between a vestibule and the secure part of a building. = On Automatic Doors = In some jurisdictions, when automatic doors are used on the primary exit route, these doors are equipped with crash bars. In the event the automatic door does not function, it becomes an outward swinging rather than sliding door. Crash bars are one of many emergency release mechanisms that can be used with automatic doors. Depending on available space, a common alternative is to install an emergency exit door beside the automatic doors. Installation of a secondary crash bar equipped exit is often required in large buildings with revolving doors, since these are too slow for a crowd to move through. Automatic Sliding Doors with Crash Bars Around the world Cross bar style exit doors in Turkey = European Union = In the European Union, panic bars are governed by the standard EN 1125, Panic exit devices operated by a horizontal bar. As with other EN family standards, the English language version is produced by the British Standards Institution and utilizes the call sign BS EN 1125. Panic bars are required to conform to this standard in order to carry CE marking and thus be sold in the European Economic Area. In 2008, the standard was updated to include an alpha- numeric labeling scheme. In this system, products are tested to various benchmarks and assigned a letter or number accordingly. Products must achieve minimum quality scores in order to receive general CE approval. The 9 rating categories are: # Category of Use # Number of Test Cycles # Test Door Mass # Fire Resistance # Safety # Corrosion Resistance # Security # Projection of device # Type of device # EN 1125 is one of two standards which govern exit devices in the EU. The other standard, EN 179, governs door handles, push pads, and other exit devices with emergency release functionality. However, EN 179 devices shall only be used at locations where people \\"are familiar with the emergency exit and its hardware and therefore a panic situation is unlikely to appear\\". Examples of places where EN 179 hardware may be used in place of EN 1125 panic bars include small apartment buildings and offices. =United States= The first panic bar, made by Von Duprin, was available by 1908 in many models and configurations.Sweet's Indexed Catalogue of Building Construction, 1909 In the US, building exit requirements are generally controlled by model codes such as the International Building Code and the NFPA Life Safety Code. Adoption of regulations varies by location and may occur at the city, county, or state level. Model codes are usually supplemented with amendments adopted locally. Additional requirements may be imposed on a site from an Authority Having Jurisdiction such as a local fire marshal. Factors considered when mandating exit devices include the number of occupants who would need to leave in an emergency, the availability of other nearby exits, and proximity to any hazards equipment or chemicals. = Differences between Europe and North America and Emerging Trends = In Europe, most panic bars are of the cross bar type, which are called Type A in the EN 1125 standard. This contrasts strongly with North American architectural design, which years ago switched to using predominantly touch bars (EN 1125 Type B) in new construction. In Europe, the use of panic bars is generally confined to code required applications. In US and Canadian commercial buildings, they are frequently used even where not required by code, because bars are seen as being easier to use than knobs or lever handles. For example, when used on the rear service door of a business, a worker whose hands are being used to carry bulky items can lean against a bar to release the lock. While the public generally prefers automatic doors, they can be costly to install and maintain. Some manufacturers offer crash bars designed to resist microbial growth. This can include coating the bar with silver ions in order to create a chemical environment hostile to unwanted microbes. Antimicrobial surfaces have shown to be effective at inhibiting bacterial, mold, and mildew growth; but may not be effective at stopping viruses such as COVID-19.

The process of browning is one of the chemical reactions that take place in food chemistry and represents an interesting research topic regarding health, nutrition, and food technology. Though there are many different ways food chemically changes over time, browning in particular falls into 2 main categories: enzymatic versus non-enzymatic browning processes. Browning has many important implications on the food industry relating to nutrition, technology, and economic cost. Researchers are especially interested in studying the control (inhibition) of browning and the different methods that can be employed to maximize this inhibition and ultimately prolong the shelf life of food.  Enzymatic browning  Enzymatic browning is one of the most important reactions that takes place in most fruits and vegetables as well as in seafood. These processes affect the taste, color, and value of such foods. Generally, it is a chemical reaction involving polyphenol oxidase, catechol oxidase, and other enzymes that create melanins and benzoquinone from natural phenols. Enzymatic browning (also called oxidation of foods) requires exposure to oxygen. It begins with the oxidation of phenols by polyphenol oxidase into quinones, whose strong electrophilic state causes high susceptibility to a nucleophilic attack from other proteins. These quinones are then polymerized in a series of reactions, eventually resulting in the formation of brown pigments (melanosis) on the surface of the food. The rate of enzymatic browning is reflected by the amount of active polyphenol oxidases present in the food. Hence most research investigating methods to inhibit enzymatic browning has focused on hindering polyphenol oxidase activity. However, not all browning of food produces negative effects. Example of a general reaction of polyphenols by Polyphenol Oxidases that catalyzes enzymatic browning. The production of Quinones undergoes more reactions which eventually form brown pigments on the surface of the food. A desirable enzymatic browning reaction is involved in the process of grapes becoming raisins. Examples of beneficial enzymatic browning: * Developing color and flavor in Coffee, Cocoa beans, and tea. * Developing color and flavor in dried fruit such as figs and raisins. A non-desirable enzymatic browning reaction is involved in the formation of brown spots on the peel of bananas. Examples of non-beneficial enzymatic browning: * Fresh fruit and vegetables, including apples, potatoes, bananas and avocados. * Polyphenols oxidases is the major reaction in the formation of Melanosis in crustaceans such as shrimp.  Control of enzymatic browning  A variety of methods are used to prevent or slow down enzymatic browning of foods, each method aimed at targeting specific steps of the chemical reaction. The control of enzymatic browning has always been a challenge for the food industry. In addition, the use of chemicals to inhibit browning, such as sulfite (a powerful antibrowning chemical) have been reconsidered due to the potential hazards it causes along with its activity. Much research has been conducted regarding the exact types of control mechanisms that take place when confronted with these enzymatic process. The different types of enzymatic browning control can be classified into different groups. * Lemon juice and other acids lower the pH and remove the copper cofactor necessary for the responsible enzymes to function * Blanching or roasting of foods, to denature the enzymes, and to destroy the responsible reactants, as used in the \\"kill green\\" phase of tea processing. * Low temperatures can also prevent enzymatic browning by reducing rate of reaction. * Use of ascorbic acid in certain pH's to control browning of apples under certain conditions by changing their phenolase activity. Different pH values affect phenolase activity of apples differently. * Proteins can exert an inhibitory effect on PPO activity by Chelating the essential copper at the active site of PPO through competitive inhibition, inhibiting its activity * During wine synthesis, the use of Ion- exchange filtration is used to remove the brown color sediments in the solution. * Arctic Apples have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect, and improving apple eating quality.  Non-enzymatic browning  The crust of 225x225px The second type of browning, nonenzymatic browning, is a process that also produces the brown pigmentation in foods, but without the activity of enzymes. The two main forms of non-enzymatic browning are caramelization and the Maillard reaction. Both vary in the reaction rate as a function of water activity (in food chemistry, the standard state of water activity is most often defined as the partial vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature). Caramelization is a process involving the pyrolysis of sugar. It is used extensively in cooking for the desired nutty flavor and brown color. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor. Example caramelization of table sugar (sucrose) caramelizing to a brown nutty flavor substance (furan and maltol)Overview of the mechanism of non-enzymatic Maillard reaction in foods. The schiff base loses a CO2 molecule and adds to water. Notice the interaction between the amine group of the amino acid (asparagine here) and the carbonyl carbon of the sugar (glucose). The end product is acrylamide. For more information, visit Maillard reaction. The other non-enzymatic reaction is the Maillard reaction. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry, since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor. Melanoidins are brown, high molecular weight heterogeneous polymers that are formed when sugars and amino acids combine through the Maillard reaction at high temperatures and low water activity. Melanoidins are commonly present in foods that have undergone some form of non-enzymatic browning, such as barley malts (Vienna and Munich), bread crust, bakery products and coffee. They are also present in the wastewater of sugar refineries, necessitating treatment in order to avoid contamination around the outflow of these refineries.  Browning of grapes during winemaking  Like most fruit, grapes vary in the number of phenolic compounds they have. This characteristic is used as a parameter in judging the quality of the wine. The general process of winemaking is initiated by the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds by polyphenol oxidases. Contact between the phenolic compounds in the Vacuole of the grape cell and the Polyphenol oxidase Enzyme (located in the cytoplasm) triggers the oxidation of the grape. Thus, the initial browning of grapes occurs as a result of \\"compartmentalization modification\\" in the cells of the grape. Aged 216x216px  Implications in food industry and technology  Enzymatic browning affects the color, flavor, and nutritional value of foods, causing huge economic loss when not sold to consumers on time. It is estimated that more than 50% of produce is lost as a result of enzymatic browning. The increase in human population and consequential depletion in our natural resources has prompted many biochemists and Food engineers alike to find new and improved techniques to preserve food longer, by using methods to inhibit the browning reaction, and effectively increase the shelf life of foods. A better understanding of the enzymatic browning mechanisms, specifically, understanding the properties of the enzymes and substrates that are involved in the reaction, may help food technologists to control certain stages in the mechanism and inhibit browning. Apples are fruits commonly studied by researchers due to their high phenolic content, which make them highly susceptible to enzymatic browning. In accordance with other findings regarding apples and browning activity, a correlation has been found between high phenolic amount and enzymatic activity of apples. This provides a hope for food industries in an effort to genetically modify foods to decrease polyphenol oxidase activity and thus decrease browning. An example of such accomplishments in food engineering is in the production of Arctic Apples. These apples, engineered by Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc, are a result of gene splicing, a technique that has allowed for the reduction in polyphenol oxidase. Another type of issue that is closely studied is the browning of seafood. Seafood, in particular shrimp, is a delicacy consumed by people all over the world. The browning of shrimp which is actually referred to as Melanosis, creates a great concern for food handlers and consumers. Melanosis mainly occurs during postmortem handling and refrigerated storage. Recent studies have found a plant extract that acts as an anti melatonin polyphenol oxidase inhibitor and serves the same function as sulfites but without the health risks.

He has been described as \\"the most important mathematician in Germany of the postwar period.\\" Education Hirzebruch was born in Hamm, Westphalia in 1927. His father of the same name was a math teacher. Hirzebruch studied at the University of M√ºnster from 1945‚Äì1950, with one year at ETH Z√ºrich. Career Hirzebruch then held a position at Erlangen, followed by the years 1952‚Äì54 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. After one year at Princeton University 1955‚Äì56, he was made a professor at the University of Bonn, where he remained, becoming director of the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Mathematik in 1981. More than 300 people gathered in celebration of his 80th birthday in Bonn in 2007. The Hirzebruch‚ÄìRiemann‚ÄìRoch theorem (1954) for complex manifolds was a major advance and quickly became part of the mainstream developments around the classical Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem; it was also a precursor of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem. Hirzebruch's book Neue topologische Methoden in der algebraischen Geometrie (1956) was a basic text for the 'new methods' of sheaf theory, in complex algebraic geometry. He went on to write the foundational papers on topological K-theory with Michael Atiyah, and collaborated with Armand Borel on the theory of characteristic classes. In his later work he provided a detailed theory of Hilbert modular surfaces, with Don Zagier. He even found connections between the Dedekind sum in number theory and differential topology, one of the many discoveries found between these different fields. His work influenced a generation of prominent mathematicians like Kunihiko Kodaira, John Milnor, Borel, Atiyah, Raoul Bott and Jean-Pierre Serre. In March 1945, Hirzebruch became a soldier, and in April, in the last weeks of Hitler's rule, he was taken prisoner by the British forces then invading Germany from the west. When a British soldier found that he was studying mathematics, he drove him home and released him, and told him to continue studying. Hirzebruch is famous for organizing the Mathematische Arbeitstagung (\\"working meetings\\" in German) in Bonn University, beginning from 1957, and the first speakers include Atiyah, Jacques Tits, Alexander Grothendieck, Hans Grauert, Nicolaas Kuiper, and Hirzebruch himself. It allowed international cooperation among the mathematical world for the last 60 years and was a major source of developments in topology, geometry, group theory, number theory as well as mathematical physics in a few decades' time. He also established the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics at Bonn in 1980. The institute became the place for the Arbeitstagung and Hirzebruch was its director until 1995. The second Arbeitstagung began in 1993 and continues to this day. From 1970 to 1971 he was the Donegall Lecturer in Mathematics at Trinity College Dublin. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, Hirzebruch has supervised the doctoral studies of 52 mathematicians. Some of them include Egbert Brieskorn, Matthias Kreck, Don Zagier, Detlef Gromoll, Klaus J√§nich, Lothar G√∂ttsche, Dietmar Arlt, Winfried Scharlau, Walter Neumann, Wolfgang Meyer, Kang Zuo, Hans Scheerer, Erich Ossa, Klaus Lamotke, Eduardo Mendoza, Dimitrios Dais and Friedhelm Waldhausen. Hirzebruch died at the age of 84 on 27 May 2012.Max Planck Institute Announcement, Max Planck Institute for Mathematics. Retrieved on 29 May 2012. Honours and awards Amongst many other honours, Hirzebruch was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 1988 and a Lobachevsky Medal in 1989. The government of Japan awarded him the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1996 and he Seki-Takakazu prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan (MSJ) in 1997.L'Harmattan web site (in French), Order with gold and silver rays Hirzebruch won an Einstein Medal of the Albert Einstein society in Bern in 1999, and received the Cantor medal in 2004. Hirzebruch was a foreign member of numerous academies and societies, including the United States National Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Royal Society and the French Academy of Sciences. In 1980‚Äì81 he delivered the first Sackler Distinguished Lecture in Israel. He was also a member of academies of Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Israel, Finland, Hungary, Netherlands, G√∂ttingen, Austria, Ireland as well as the Academia Europaea and the European Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hirzebruch was the president of the German Mathematical Society in 1962 and 1990, first after the foundation of a separate Eastern German mathematical due to the German division, and then again after the collapse of the wall which led to the unification of the East and West German Mathematical societies. He was also the first President of the European Mathematical Society from 1990 to 1994. In this way, he rebuilt the mathematical life in both Germany and Europe after the war.

She released three albums in the pop and pop/rock genre in her late teens, from 1977 through 1981 under her full name. In 1984, she re-emerged as Dalbello, with an edgier brand of alternative rock. Early life Born to Italian and British parents, Dalbello grew up in Weston, Toronto, and then with her family moved to Vaughan. At age 11, she began playing guitar and writing her own songs, performing at the Mariposa Folk Festival and the Fiddlers' Green club in Toronto. The first song she wrote was reportedly a protest song called \\"Oh, Why?\\" Lying about her age, at 13 she joined a government-sponsored educational music program, Summer Sounds '71, which auditioned students at various southern Ontario middle and high schools, with the objective of selecting 30 singers, songwriters, musicians and performers who would receive the opportunity to spend the first month north of the city of Toronto at a summer camp. The students would collaborate creatively, forming small music groups and bands for which they rehearsed and built a full show that toured and performed at various events throughout Ontario for the second month. Recording career In her early teens Dal Bello was featured on a record by St. Margaret Mary Church Singers, where she performed two covers of traditional church songs - \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\". At the age of 14, Dal Bello made her 1974 recording debut with a 4-song EP that was recorded for CBC Radio, Canada's national broadcaster. The record was produced by Jack Budgell. The EP featured four songs written and composed by Dal Bello - \\"Mourning In The Morning\\", \\"The Old Man\\", \\"Come Sun Days\\" and \\"Human\\". In 1975 Dal Bello was featured on a Christmas compilation by the CBC Radio, where she performs the traditional Christmas carols \\"Deck The Halls\\" and \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" and a medley together with Dianne Brooks and Roy Kenner. These records were not commercially available, and airplay was legally restricted to the CBC only. Signing with MCA Records out of L.A. when she was 17, Dalbello's self-titled debut album in 1977 was produced by David Foster and featured the then-unknown Toto members Mike Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, Steve Lukather, David Paich and David Hungate. She also collaborated with Jay Graydon, who is featured on guitar. The album won a 1978 Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year. Despite her win, however, MCA dropped her from the label because the album's production had been too expensive.\\"The Many Faces of Lisa Dal Bello\\". Music Express, 22 May 2014. During these sessions Dal Bello recorded a song for Jay Graydon called \\"You're My Day\\". Written by Graydon and Harry Garfield, the song is not featured on the album. The song was later released on a 2006 compilation album by Graydon, titled \\"Past To Present - The 70s\\". Mike Porcaro played bass on her next album Pretty Girls released independently via Talisman Records. Pretty Girls received her second Juno nomination in 1979 in the category of Female Vocalist of the Year. The album was later reissued by Capitol Records. Dal Bello, signed to Capitol Records, released her third album Drastic Measures in 1981. Dal Bello collaborated with Bryan Adams and Tim Thorney on the album. After Drastic Measures, she took a break from recording to re-evaluate her creative and personal priorities and to work on her poetry.. Dalbello received a Juno nomination in 1980 for Female Vocalist of The Year and in 1983 was again nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year. She told Billboard, \\"I felt there was no point in making records if I hadn't found a sense of how I fitted in musically, and how to express myself. I hadn't yet learned how to convey my musical ideas to the people I was working with.\\" During this time, David Bowie's former Ziggy Stardust guitarist Mick Ronson saw her in a CBC Television documentary on Canadian music while working at Phase One recording studio in Toronto and convinced her to record another album. That album, whomanfoursays (a homophone for \\"human forces\\"), was co-produced by Dalbello and Ronson. It was also her first album recorded as Dalbello, and marked her transformation into an edgy rock artist.\\"Toronto singer back on the scene\\". Toronto Star, 15 June 1984. The transformation worked ‚Äì the album was even more successful on the Canadian pop charts than her earlier albums had been. The album spawned the hit singles \\"Gonna Get Close to You\\", later covered by Queensr√øche, and \\"Animal\\" that was covered by Heavens Gate. whomanfoursays garnered four Juno nominations: two for Dalbello herself as Producer of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year, one for Lenny De Rose for Recording Engineer of the Year and one for art director Heather Brown and photographer Deborah Samuels for Best Album Graphic.\\"The Juno nominees are...\\" Toronto Star, 5 December 1984. In 1985, Dalbello was nominated for a seventh Juno in the category of Female Vocalist of the Year. In 1986, Dalbello wrote and recorded the songs \\"Black on Black\\" and \\"I Do What I Do\\" for the 9 1/2 Weeks soundtrack. Although included in the film, Dalbello's recording of \\"I Do What I Do\\" was not on the soundtrack album, which instead featured a recording by John Taylor of Duran Duran; her recording of \\"Black on Black\\" did, however, appear in both the film and the soundtrack album. Dalbello also worked with other artists including Duran Duran's John Taylor, Heart, the band Nena, Glass Tiger and their producer Jim Vallance. Ronson and Dalbello planned to record a second album, however, Ronson was passed over by both her record label and her manager at that time, Roger Davies, over Dalbello's strong objections. Dalbello then submitted four self-produced song demos to her U.S. label and manager, only to have them rejected because they wanted a real producer. Accordingly, in 1986, it was reported that Rupert Hine had finished producing a new album for Dalbello.\\"'Renaissance' rock star puts on his thinking cap\\". Toronto Star, 5 September 1986. However, regardless of the status of the Hine-produced album, partly out of frustration and partly as a practical joke, Dalbello re- submitted her self-produced song demos‚Äîcrediting the producer as \\"Bill Da Salleo\\", which was nothing more than a simple anagram of her name. To her surprise, her label and manager excitedly called her up saying that they loved the new demos and believed \\"Bill\\" was the perfect producer for the project. The Hine-produced album was subsequently scrapped, and remains unissued. However, Dalbello would contribute guest vocals to Hine's \\"virtual band\\" project Thinkman, appearing on the title track of their 1986 debut album, The Formula. Dalbello continued to produce her new album under the \\"Da Salleo\\" pseudonym, managing to keep both her label and manager from visiting the sessions by booking the studio time late at night. She broke the \\"news\\" of \\"Bill's premature death\\" to her Canadian A&R; person Deane Cameron just prior to delivering the album to the label, and shortly after Cameron called her out of concern that the label had no signed production agreement between Bill Da Salleo and themselves. When the ruse was revealed, Cameron, a maverick in Canadian music circles who was the first record label A&R; person to have signing autonomy from his U.S. label counterpart out of L.A., reportedly laughed out loud, proclaiming that Dalbello had \\"truly kicked the L.A. A&R; offices' asses.\\" However, with the knowledge that Bill Da Salleo was actually Dalbello, her manager began to question the strength of the album's production and commercial viability. It was suggested that half the album be scrapped and new songs be recorded with a new producer and other songwriters. The album was delayed 18 months as a result. EMI released the album she in 1987. The album's singles, \\"Tango\\" and \\"Black on Black\\", were Dalbello's biggest hits. The success of she allowed her to tour extensively, particularly through Europe. After the album's release, Dalbello ended her contract with Capitol Records and decided to relocate to Los Angeles in 1990. During her time in L.A., Dalbello spent the next four years expanding her musical contacts and writing songs for other artists such as Branford Marsalis and Julian Lennon, and co- writing with successful songwriters Carole Bayer Sager, Frannie Golde, Bruce Roberts, Holly Knight and Gerald O'Brien. In 1991 Ronson and Dalbello discussed collaborating again. However, everything was put on hold because of a downturn in Ronson's health. Ronson died of liver failure in 1993. In 1994 Dalbello's former manager, Roger Davies, asked her if she wanted to record another album. Through Davies' efforts, a recording deal with EMI Electrola, which is based in Germany, was forthcoming. Dalbello moved back to Toronto to complete work on her new album. She released whore in 1996,\\"Earth moves for singer Dalbello\\". The Globe and Mail, 30 August 1996. which received favorable reviews from critics upon its release. After the album's release she returned to Europe to tour for the rest of that year. Recording guest appearances In addition to having appeared on Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson's solo album Victor, contributing the lead vocal to the song \\"Start Today\\", and having recorded duets with Duran Duran's John Taylor and Boz Scaggs (\\"Miss Sun\\" from his 1980 album \\"Hits\\"), her vocals have appeared on records for Cher, Richard Marx, Heart, Alice Cooper, Patti LaBelle, Toto, Nena (for whom she wrote an entire translation album It's All in the Game) and Canadian artists Rough Trade, Kim Mitchell, Alex Lifeson and Glass Tiger. Cover versions of her music Melissa Manchester successfully took \\"Pretty Girls\\" into the US and Canadian Top 40 in 1979. Heart covered \\"Wait for an Answer\\" and did a version of \\"Black on Black\\" called \\"Black on Black II\\". Queensr√øche covered \\"Gonna Get Close to You\\". Both Hauteville and Meliesa McDonell covered \\"Immaculate Eyes\\". Julie Masse covered \\"Devious Nature\\". Heavens Gate covered \\"Animal\\". Her song \\"Don't Get Mad Get Even\\" was recorded in 1983 by the Canadian heavy metal band Helix for their third album No Rest for the Wicked, and by The Lydia Taylor Band for their EP Bitch.  Influence  Because of her powerful voice and aggressive persona, as well as her career path of starting out as a conventional mainstream dance-pop singer before reinventing herself as an idiosyncratic alternative rock artist, comparisons have been drawn between Dalbello and Alanis Morissette. However, she refused to take credit for paving the way for other female rockers like Morissette. As she explained to Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun, \\"someone like Alanis has a sense of angst, a sense of unrest within herself and that's coming from her personal experiences which are different from mine.\\" Dalbello credited women rockers such as Chrissie Hynde (of the Pretenders), Annie Lennox (of Eurythmics) and Patti Smith as paving the way for her and others. Songwriter and producer for other artists Dalbello has not released another album since 1996 and has primarily focused on producing and writing for other artists such as Heart, Julian Lennon, Nena, and Patti LaBelle, whom she also produced. Some of the artists and writers she has co-written with are her friends Bryan Adams, Julian Lennon and Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, as well as David Foster, Carole Bayer-Sager, Holly Knight, Chaka Khan, Branford Marsalis, Damhnait Doyle and Dan Hill. Television commercials and documentary voice work Throughout her recording career, Dalbello has been a session vocalist and voiceover artist on TV and radio commercials in North America, for which she now also writes and arranges music. In 1982 she sang the theme to the ABC TV movie The Sins of Dorian Gray. Her voice work also expanded into areas of documentary work, as well as character voices for the TV anime series Sailor Moon, her most known role as Queen Nehelenia. She performed the song \\"Always\\" for the Cheer detergent commercial \\"Coming Home\\" that aired in 2003, which was so popular and garnered so many inquires, that Cheer commissioned her to do a full length version which they made available for download from their website. Also in 2003, she performed the corporate \\"Built for Life in Canada\\" song for Ford of Canada; the song was a downloadable MP3 from the Canadian Ford website and was available to download until early 2004. Her song \\"Faith in You (With All Your Heart)\\" was used to promote the launch of the Ford Focus automobile in North America; commercials featuring it played in movie theatres and on television. From 2002 to 2008, she was the brand announcer voice for the Canadian cable news network CBC Newsworld, and her voice was heard introducing CBC News anchor Peter Mansbridge on the network's flagship nightly news and current affairs program, The National. She also was featured on Degrassi: The Next Generation Theme, the theme song for the first three seasons of the television series Degrassi: The Next Generation. In late 2011 Dalbello recorded three 30-second songs, \\"Every Moment\\", \\"Lift You Up\\", and \\"Something Good\\", for The Keg chain of steakhouse restaurants in Canada and the United States. In late 2012, the Juno Awards' online series, Juno TV, interviewed Dalbello, who shared her thoughts on her early career. The interview aired in June 2013, and was also one of her first recorded appearances in over 15 years. Personal life Dalbello currently resides in Toronto, Ontario.

Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent ignition of an uncontrolled fire, and those that are used to limit the development and effects of a fire after it starts. Fire safety measures include those that are planned during the construction of a building or implemented in structures that are already standing, and those that are taught to occupants of the building. Threats to fire safety are commonly referred to as fire hazards. A fire hazard may include a situation that increases the likelihood of a fire or may impede escape in the event a fire occurs. Fire safety is often a component of building safety. Those who inspect buildings for violations of the Fire Code and go into schools to educate children on Fire Safety topics are fire department members known as Fire Prevention Officers. The Chief Fire Prevention Officer or Chief of Fire Prevention will normally train newcomers to the Fire Prevention Division and may also conduct inspections or make presentations. Elements of a fire safety policy Fire safety policies apply at the construction of a building and throughout its operating life. Building codes are enacted by local, sub-national, or national governments to ensure such features as adequate fire exits, signage, and construction details such as fire stops and fire rated doors, windows, and walls. Fire safety is also an objective of electrical codes to prevent overheating of wiring or equipment, and to protect from ignition by electrical faults. Fire codes regulate such requirements as the maximum occupancy for buildings such as theatres or restaurants, for example. Fire codes may require portable fire extinguishers within a building, or may require permanently installed fire detection and suppression equipment such as a fire sprinkler system and a fire alarm system. Local authorities charged with fire safety may conduct regular inspections for such items as usable fire exits and proper exit signage, functional fire extinguishers of the correct type in accessible places, and proper storage and handling of flammable materials. Depending on local regulations, a fire inspection may result in a notice of required action, or closing of a building until it can be put into compliance with fire code requirements. Owners and managers of a building may implement additional fire policies. For example, an industrial site may designate and train particular employees as a fire fighting force. Managers must ensure buildings comply with fire evacuation regulations, and that building features such as spray fireproofing remains undamaged. Fire policies may be in place to dictate training and awareness of occupants and users of the building to avoid obvious mistakes, such as the propping open of fire doors. Buildings, especially institutions such as schools, may conduct fire drills at regular intervals throughout the year. Common fire hazards Improper use and poor maintenance of gas stoves often create fire hazards. Some common fire hazards are: *Kitchen fires from unattended cooking, grease fires/chip pan fires *Electrical systems that are overloaded, poorly maintained or defective *Combustible storage areas with insufficient protection *Combustibles near equipment that generates heat, flame, or sparks *Candles and other open flames *Smoking (Cigarettes, cigars, pipes, lighters, etc.) *Equipment that generates heat and utilizes combustible materials *Flammable liquids and aerosols *Flammable solvents (and rags soaked with solvent) placed in enclosed trash cans *Fireplace chimneys not properly or regularly cleaned *Cooking appliances - stoves, ovens *Heating appliances - fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, furnaces, boilers, portable heaters, solid fuels *Household appliances - clothes dryers, curling irons, hair dryers, refrigerators, freezers, boilers *Chimneys that concentrate creosote *Electrical wiring in poor condition *Leaking/ defective batteries *Personal ignition sources - matches, lighters *Electronic and electrical equipment *Exterior cooking equipment - barbecue Fire code An example of a fire code violation in the United States In the United States, the fire code (also fire prevention code or fire safety code) is a model code adopted by the state or local jurisdiction and enforced by fire prevention officers within municipal fire departments. It is a set of rules prescribing minimum requirements to prevent fire and explosion hazards arising from storage, handling, or use of dangerous materials, or from other specific hazardous conditions. It complements the building code. The fire code is aimed primarily at preventing fires, ensuring that necessary training and equipment will be on hand, and that the original design basis of the building, including the basic plan set out by the architect, is not compromised. The fire code also addresses inspection and maintenance requirements of various fire protection equipment in order to maintain optimal active fire protection and passive fire protection measures. A typical fire safety code includes administrative sections about the rule-making and enforcement process, and substantive sections dealing with fire suppression equipment, particular hazards such as containers and transportation for combustible materials, and specific rules for hazardous occupancies, industrial processes, and exhibitions. Sections may establish the requirements for obtaining permits and specific precautions required to remain in compliance with a permit. For example, a fireworks exhibition may require an application to be filed by a licensed pyrotechnician, providing the information necessary for the issuing authority to determine whether safety requirements can be met. Once a permit is issued, the same authority (or another delegated authority) may inspect the site and monitor safety during the exhibition, with the power to halt operations, when unapproved practices are seen or when unforeseen hazards arise. =List of some typical fire and explosion issues in a fire code= *Fireworks, explosives, mortars and cannons, model rockets (licenses for manufacture, storage, transportation, sale, use) *Certification for servicing, placement, and inspecting fire extinguishing equipment *General storage and handling of flammable liquids, solids, gases (tanks, personnel training, markings, equipment) *Limitations on locations and quantities of flammables (e.g., 10 liters of gasoline inside a residential dwelling) *Specific uses and specific flammables (e.g., dry cleaning, gasoline distribution, explosive dusts, pesticides, space heaters, plastics manufacturing) *Permits and limitations in various building occupancies (assembly hall, hospital, school, theater, elderly care, child care, prs) that require a smoke detector, sprinkler system, fire extinguisher, or other specific equipment or procedures *Removal of interior and exterior obstructions to emergency exits or firefighters and removal of hazardous materials *Permits and limitations in special outdoor applications (tents, asphalt kettles, bonfires, etc.) *Other hazards (flammable decorations, welding, smoking, bulk matches, tire yards) *Electrical safety codes such as the National Electrical Code (by the National Fire Protection Association) for the U.S. and some other places in the Americas *Fuel gas code * Car fire Public fire safety education Children evacuating a smoky building as a way to learn fire safety Members of the United States Forest Service Fire Department teaching children fire safety Most U.S. fire departments have fire safety education programs. Fire prevention programs may include distribution of smoke detectors, visiting schools to review key topics with the students and implementing nationally recognized programs such as NFPAS \\"Risk Watch\\" and \\"Learn not to burn\\".NFPA eLearning On-line catalog Other programs or props can be purchased by fire departments or community organizations. These are usually entertaining and designed to capture children's attention and relay important messages. Props include those that are mostly auditory, such as puppets and robots. The prop is visually stimulating but the safety message is only transmitted orally. Other props are more elaborate, access more senses and increase the learning factor. They mix audio messages and visual cues with hands-on interaction. Examples of these include mobile trailer safety houses and tabletop hazard house simulators. Some fire prevention software is also being developed to identify hazards in a home.Fire prevention software All programs tend to mix messages of general injury prevention, safety, fire prevention, and escape in case of fire. In most cases the fire department representative is regarded as the expert and is expected to present information in a manner that is appropriate for each age group. =Fire educator qualifications= The US industry standard that outlines the recommended qualifications for fire safety educators is NFPA 1035: Standard for Professional Qualifications for Public Fire and Life Safety Educator, which includes the requirements for Fire and Life Safety Educator Levels I, II, and III; Public Information Officer; and Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Specialist Levels I and II. =Target audiences= According to the United States Fire Administration, the very young and the elderly are considered to be \\"at risk\\" populations. These groups represent approximately 33% of the population. Fire safety plan Fire escape plan of a hotel in Taiwan. A fire safety plan is required by all North American national, state and provincial fire codes based on building use or occupancy types. Generally, the owner of the building is responsible for the preparation of a fire safety plan. Buildings with elaborate emergency systems may require the assistance of a fire protection consultant. After the plan has been prepared, it must be submitted to the Chief Fire Official or authority having jurisdiction for approval. Once approved, the owner is responsible for implementing the fire safety plan and training all staff in their duties. It is also the owner's responsibility to ensure that all visitors and staff are informed of what to do in case of fire. During a fire emergency, a copy of the approved fire safety plan must be available for the responding fire department's use. =Fire safety plan structure= * Key contact information * Utility services (Including shut-off valves for water, gas and electric) * Access issues * Dangerous stored materials * Location of people with special needs * Connections to sprinkler system * Layout, drawing, and site plan of building * Maintenance schedules for life safety systems * Personnel training and fire drill procedure * Create assemble point/safe zone =Use of fire safety plans= Fire safety plans are a useful tool for fire fighters to have because they allow them to know critical information about a building that they may have to go into. Using this, fire fighters can locate and avoid potential dangers such as hazardous material (hazmat) storage areas and flammable chemicals. In addition to this, fire safety plans can also provide specialized information that, in the case of a hospital fire, can provide information about the location of things like the nuclear medicine ward.American, Jerry, \\"Fire Safety Disaster.\\" Canadian Healthcare Facilities Volume 28 Issue 3, ed Amie Silverwood. Spring 2008, 26. In addition to this, fire safety plans also greatly improve the safety of fire fighters. According to FEMA, 16 percent of all fire fighter deaths in 2002 occurred due to a structural collapse or because the fire fighter got lost.Fire Fighter Fatalities in the U.S. in 2002. Fema, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, July 2003 Fire safety plans can outline any possible structural hazards, as well as give the fire fighter knowledge of where he is in the building. =Fire safety plans in the fire code= In North America alone, there are around 8 million buildings that legally require a fire safety plan, be it due to provincial or state law.\\"Canadian firm generates digital fire safety plans.\\" Building Strategies, ed. Susan Maclean. Spring 2007, 14 Not having a fire safety plan for buildings which fit the fire code occupancy type can result in a fine, and they are required for all buildings, such as commercial, industrial, assembly, etc. =Advances in fire safety planning= As previously stated, a copy of the approved fire safety plan shall be available for the responding fire department. This, however, is not always the case. Up until now, all fire plans were stored in paper form in the fire department. The problem with this is that sorting and storing these plans is a challenge, and it is difficult for people to update their fire plans. As a result, only half of the required buildings have fire plans, and of those, only around 10 percent are up-to- date. This problem has been solved through the introduction of digital fire plans. These fire plans are stored in a database and can be accessed wirelessly on site by firefighters and are much simpler for building owners to update.

He is remembered as one of the pre-eminent Marxist economists of the 20th century. Biography Maurice Dobb was born on 24 July 1900 in London, the son of Walter Herbert Dobb and the former Elsie Annie Moir.Ronald L. Meek, \\"Portrait: Maurice Dobb,\\" Challenge, vol. 22, no. 5 (Nov./Dec. 1979), p. 60. Dobb and his family lived in Willesden, a suburb of London. Dobb was educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, an independent boarding school.Meek, \\"Portrait: Maurice Dobb,\\" pp. 60‚Äì61. He began writing after the death of his mother, during his early teenage years, and his covert, introverted personality prevented him from building a network of friends. His earliest novels were fictional fantasies. Much like his father, Dobb initiated practice in Christian Science after his mother's death; the family had previously belonged to the Presbyterian church. Saved from military conscription by the Armistice of November 1918, Dobb was admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, in 1919 as an exhibitioner to study economics.Meek, \\"Portrait: Maurice Dobb,\\" pg. 61. Dobb gained firsts in both parts of the economics tripos in 1921 and 1922 and was admitted to the London School of Economics for graduate studies. Following his achievement of a PhD in 1924, Dobb returned to Cambridge to take up a post as University lecturer. In 1920, after Dobb‚Äôs first year at Pembroke College, John Maynard Keynes invited Dobb to join the Political Economy Club, and after graduation Keynes helped him secure a position at Cambridge. Dobb was open with his students about his communist beliefs. One of his students, Victor Kiernan, later reported: \\"We had no time then to assimilate Marxist theory more than very roughly; it was only beginning to take root in England, although it had one remarkable expounder at Cambridge in Maurice Dobb.\\" Victor Kiernan, London Review of Books (25 June 1987) Dobb's house, \\"St Andrews\\" in Chesterton Lane, was a frequent meeting place for Cambridge communists that it was known locally as \\"The Red House\\".Biography of Maurice Dobb Dobb joined the Communist Party in 1920 and during the 1930s was central to the burgeoning Communist movement at the university. One of his recruits was Kim Philby, who later became a high-placed mole within British intelligence. It has been suggested that Dobb was a \\"talent-spotter\\" for the Comintern.Phillip Knightley, Philby: The Life and Views of the KGB Masterspy, Andre Deutsch, London, 1988, pp 30‚Äì31, 36‚Äì37, 45. Dobb was one of the great communist revolutionaries in Britain at the time. He was very politically active and spent a considerable amount of time organizing rallies and presenting lectures on a consistent basis. The economist commonly focused on vulnerability to economic crisis, and pointed to the United States when referring to capitalist money assisting military agendas instead of public works. =Career= Dobb's position at Trinity helped him stay connected to the college for more than 50 years. Dobb was elected as a fellow of Trinity College at Cambridge in 1948, at which time he began joint work with Piero Sraffa assembling the selected works and letters of David Ricardo.Antonio Callari, \\"Maurice Herbert Dobb (1900‚Äì1976),\\" in Robert A. Gorman (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of Marxism. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1986; pp. 95‚Äì97. The result of this effort was eventually published in eleven volumes.Piero Sraffa and M.H. Dobb (eds.), The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo. Eleven volumes. Cambridge University Press, 1951‚Äì1973. Available online. He did not receive a University readership until 1959. Over the span of his career he published twelve academic books, more than twenty-four pamphlets, and numerous articles meant for general audiences. He often wrote on political economy, drawing a connection between the social context and problems in society and how that influences market exchange. \\"Economic relations of men determine social associations of men\\" he said in his Marxian economics class. Dobb believed the capitalist system created classes, and with class comes class warfare. After his 1925 trip to Russia with Keynes, Dobb refrained slightly from his interests of political conflict; he was notorious for long and dull lectures with fewer attendees each class. Other positions held by Dobb around 1928 include teaching in a summer school, acting as the Chairman of the Faculty of Economics of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and even helping to launch the party's own film company. He encountered differing opinions with people in the party, pushing that intellect and political activity are not mutually exclusive. In 1931, Dobb married Barbara Marian Nixon, and unlike his first marriage stayed with Nixon for the rest of his life. She never claimed herself a communist, but was an active member of the Labour Party and held a seat on the London County Council while pursuing a career in acting. Dobb's personal life was of particular interest to his colleagues, and due to the controversy Pembroke College dropped Dobb as a Director of StudiesA don responsible for supervising the academic progress of students in a given subject in a given college, even if he does not personally teach the student in question. Every student reports both to a Tutor, responsible for his personal welfare, and to a Director of Studies. and withdrew his dining rights. In the same year he had given a lecture describing a recent trip to Russia, which prompted some to call him a \\"paid official of the Russian government\\", and in turn caused a small scandal at Cambridge. Dobb responded by writing an article in The Times claiming he had no connection to the Soviet Union. = The Hogarth Press = The Hogarth Press, founded by Virginia and Leonard Woolf, was a printing press intent on publishing items that encouraged free exchange of ideas. Leonard Woolf himself was an anti-imperialist. He also believed intellectual exchange was the same as economical exchange in material form; Dobb‚Äôs publications were both intellectual exchange through introduction and defense of Marxism, as well as a pieces of work that could be sold. Publications possibly reflected the opinions of Leonard and Virginia Woolf. Leonard Woolf later commissioned The Political and Social Doctrine of Communism, and originally asked Maurice Dobb and another author, who both refused. Between ‚Äú1924 and the late 1930s, the Hogarth Press published eight pamphlets on Russia, communism, and Marxism‚Ä¶ the motives, supported by Leonard Woolf, were political and educational.\\" Dobb published two pamphlets with the Hogarth Press. The first, Russia To-day and Tomorrow (1930), was written after his return from Russia with Keynes. Dobb comments on the Soviet Union‚Äôs economy, politics, industry, and culture. Russia To-Day and Tomorrow was a bestseller during the 1930s. His second publication, On Marxism To-Day (1932) was another pamphlet meant to be a rudimentary introduction to communism directed to the general public. =Death and legacy= Maurice Dobb died on 17 August 1976. Before his death in 1976 and the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Dobb started to question his earlier devotion to Russia‚Äôs economics. His communist ideals, however, did not die with him. Dobb had two notable students, Amartya Sen and Eric Hobsbawm. Sen won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 and Bharat Ratna in 1999 for his work in welfare economics, as well as the inaugural Charleston-EFG John Maynard Keynes Prize in recognition of his work on welfare economics. Sen is also a fellow at Trinity College, much like Dobb was. Hobsbawm attended the University of Cambridge, like Dobb, and was a Marxist historiographer who published numerous works on Marxism and was also active in the Communist Party Historians Group and the British Communist Party. Economic thought Dobb was an economist who was primarily involved in the interpretation of neoclassical economic theory from a Marxist point of view. His involvement in the original economic calculation problem debate consisted of critiques of capitalist, centrally planned socialist, or market socialist models that were based upon the neoclassical framework of static equilibrium. Dobb was quite critical of the marginalist thought within neoclassical economics as well. Since Marx passed away by the time this economic thought became popular within the field, Dobb would argue in favor of Marx. Marginal utility, the main foundation of marginalism, states that there is a way to quantify levels of satisfaction as a person consumes each additional unit of a good. The level of satisfaction also depends on the person‚Äôs individual behavior. These ideas indicated that the prices set for goods are more, if not completely, influenced by the individual‚Äôs willingness to spend. The perceived value an individual gives to a good is the opposite of Marx‚Äôs labor theory of value described in Value, Price, Profit which states that the price for that good is determined by the amount of socially acceptable labor that goes into production. In Dobb‚Äôs book, Theories of Value and Distribution Since Adam Smith: Ideology and Economic Theory, Dobb argued that marginal utility and individual satisfaction cannot determine prices like marginalism suggests. In fact, Dobb stated that a person‚Äôs preferences and levels of satisfaction is heavily dependent on their individual wealth. In other words, their marginal utility is determined by their spending power. This spending power, according to Dobb, was the distribution of wealth and that alone could change prices since the price would depend on how much someone would spend on it. Therefore, he argued that individual behavior cannot influence prices since there are many other factors such as labor and spending power that can affect them. Bharadwaj, K. (1978) Maurice Dobb's critique of theories of value and distribution. Cambridge Journal of Economics. Vol. 2, 153-174. Cambridge University Press. Dobb charged the market socialist model of Oskar Lange and the contributions of \\"neo-classical\\" socialists of an illegitimate \\"narrowing of the focus of study to problems of exchange-relations.\\" (Economists and the Economics of Socialism, 1939.) Many of his works have been published into different languages. His short publication Introduction to Economics was translated to Spanish by the Mexican intellectual Antonio Castro Leal for the leading Mexican publishing house Fondo de Cultura Economica, which has gone through more than ten editions since 1938. For Dobb, the central economic challenges for socialism are related to production and investment in their dynamic aspects. He identified three major advantages of planned economies: antecedent co-ordination, external effects and variables in planning. =Antecedent co-ordination= Planned economies employ antecedent co- ordination of the economy. In contrast a market economy atomises its agents by definition, the expectations which form the basis of their decisions are always based on uncertainty. There is a poverty of information which often leads to disequilibrium that can only be corrected in a market ex post (after the event), and thus resources are wasted. An advantage of antecedent planning is removal of significant degrees of uncertainty in a context of coordinated and unified information gathering and decision-making prior to the commitment of resources. =External effects= Dobb was an early theorist to recognise the relevance of external effects to market exchanges. In a market economy, each economic agent in an exchange makes decisions on the basis of a narrow range of information in ignorance of any wider social effects of production and consumption. When external effects are significant, it invalidates the information transmitting qualities of market prices so that prices will not reflect true social opportunity costs. He claimed that contrary to the convenient assumptions of mainstream economists, significant external effects are in fact pervasive in modern market economies. Planning that coordinates interrelated decisions before their implementation can take into account a wider range of social effects. This has important applications for efficient industrial planning, including decisions about the external effects of uneven development between sectors, and in terms of the external effects of public works, and for development of infant industries; this is in addition to widely publicised negative external effects on the environment. =Variables in planning= By taking the whole complex of factors into consideration, only coordinated antecedent planning allows for fluid allocation where things that appear as \\"data\\" in static frameworks can be used as variables in a planning process. By way of example one can enumerate the following categories of \\"data\\" that under coordinated antecedent plan would assume the form of variables that can be adjusted in the plan according to circumstances: rate of investment, distribution of investment between capital and consumption, choices of production techniques, geographical distribution of investment and relatives rates of growth of transport, fuel and power, and of agriculture in relation to industry, the rate of introduction of new products, and their character, and the degree of standardisation or variety in production that the economy at its stage of development feels it can afford.

He performed with Yehudi Menuhin for several years and was a teacher of Terry Riley and Jerome Rose. Early years Baller was born July 30, 1909, in Brody, Galicia and Lodomeria, Cisleithania, Austria-Hungary (now Ukraine). At age 8, he went to Vienna to study piano with a former student of Franz Liszt. When he was 13 he gave his first solo performance, with the Vienna Philharmonic, following it with performances in all major European capitals. In March 1938, Nazi soldiers learned that he was a pianist and a Jew, and arrested him, beat him and crushed his hands. Baller's fianc√©e, Edith Strauss-Neustadt, interceded on his behalf with the Polish Consul in Vienna and helped to restore his hands through a long treatment so that he could resume his career. The couple escaped to Budapest, where they were married before coming to the United States in 1938. Career While Baller worked as a pianist for the WQXR radio station in New York City, he met violinist Yehudi Menuhin and cellist Gabor Rejto. Beginning in 1941, the Ballers lived with their daughter, Nina, at Menuhin's Alma Estate in Los Gatos, California. For several years Baller accompanied Menuhin in performances throughout the world and performed in chamber concerts, being particularly active during World War II with performances for troops deployed overseas. Under Yehudi Menuhin's patronage, Baller, Gabor Rejto and Roman Totenberg formed the Alma Trio in 1942-1943 at Menuhin's Alma estate in Los Gatos, California. Violinist Maurice Wilk joined the Alma Trio after Totenberg retired. Following Wilk's sudden death in 1963, violinist Andor Toth joined the Alma Trio and remained their violinist for the next 15 years, before the trio winded down their touring in the mid-1980s.  Later years  Baller served as a faculty member at Stanford University for over 30 years.

He was a Liberal member of the Australian Senate from 1997 to 2008, representing the state of Western Australia. Early life Lightfoot was born in Port Lincoln, South Australia and was educated at first the Adelaide, and then Kalgoorlie School of Mines. In the 1950s, he spent time as a weekend soldier, as a result of national service. Lightfoot joined the Liberal Party of Australia soon afterwards. He worked as a mounted policeman between 1959 and 1962. In 1972, Lightfoot became a pastoralist and grazier, a line of employment he subsequently occupied for twenty years. Politics =West Australian parliament= His political career began in 1986, when Lightfoot won the seat of Murchison-Eyre in Western Australia's Legislative Assembly. It was here that he first caused controversy, when he wrote to United States Secretary of State George Shultz, urging the US Government to dump subsidised wheat in Australia's international wheat markets in Russia and China. He later retracted the statement. He retired from the Legislative Assembly in 1989, but made a comeback in 1993, representing the North Metropolitan Region in the Legislative Council. While in state parliament, he also advocated for the secession of Western Australia from the rest of the country. =Federal parliament= In 1997, Western Australian Senator John Panizza died, and Lightfoot, having been selected to fill the vacancy, moved to federal politics. He soon became a controversial figure within the party, and was rebuked by Prime Minister John Howard for telling the Senate that Aborigines in their native state were the lowest colour on the civilisation spectrum. He was one of a small group of Liberal MPs willing to make a preference deal with controversial MP Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party. However, this was to assist him in gaining re-election in 2001. His comments led to numerous moves to oust him from membership of his own party, but he hung on, as he was seen to represent a movement of rural conservatives in Western Australia. Lightfoot has been an active campaigner for the rights of white Zimbabwean farmers displaced by the regime of Robert Mugabe. In 2002, he made the suggestion that some could be given residency in Australia, but denied that this should apply to black farm workers as well. This was due to Robert Mugabe's \\"Africa for Africans\\" policies and not allowing for the travelling rights of many oppressed peoples at that time. In 2003, Lightfoot was involved in an altercation on the floor of the House of Representatives during a visit by United States President George W. Bush. Australian Greens senators Bob Brown and Kerry Nettle were attempting to hand Bush a letter from the wife of Mamdouh Habib, an Australian citizen who at the time was being held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following his apprehension by United States forces in either (this is disputed) Afghanistan or Pakistan. Lightfoot physically blocked the path of the senators, elbowing Brown and reportedly telling Nettle to \\"Fuck off and die\\". On 17 March 2005, News Limited newspapers reported that Lightfoot, while on a parliamentary tour to Iraq, smuggled US$20,000 into the country on behalf of Woodside Petroleum as a donation for the Kurdish government, having been issued with a pistol for personal security. The newspapers published photographs of Lightfoot appearing with Kurdish militants wielding an AK-47. Lightfoot strenuously denied the allegations and threatened legal action against the newspapers carrying the story. Lightfoot denied handling the money personally, saying he merely witnessed the money changing hands. After speaking to Howard, Lightfoot issued a statement in which he said he felt \\"uncomfortable\\" having the gun with him and did not carry it personally. The newspapers in turn refused to retract the reports and accused Lightfoot of contradicting himself. Who's Who in Australia reports Lightfoot as being a life fellow of the International Biographical Association, a vanity press publication.Who's Who in Australia, Information Group Australia Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia, 1997 page 970 In April 2007, facing near-certain defeat in a preselection challenge by Liberal Party vice-president Mathias Cormann, he announced he would retire at the end of his term in the Senate.Former Liberal staffer wins preselection, The Age, 29 April 2007. Cormann was subsequently preselected to replace Lightfoot, but then selected unanimously by the WA Liberal Party State Council to replace Ian Campbell in the Senate, after Campbell announced his surprise resignation in May 2007. Michaelia Cash instead became Lightfoot's preselected replacement. Lightfoot retired from politics in 2008.

The population of the civil parish was 3,437 at the 2011 census. History The now-demolished Bishop's Manor House at Nettleham was the property of Edith of Wessex, wife of Edward the Confessor and later Empress Matilda, daughter of King Henry I, before passing into the possession of the Bishops of Lincoln, who enlarged it to create a Bishop's Palace appropriate to one of the country's most important Sees. On 7 February 1301 King Edward I was staying in the Bishop's Palace when he created his son Edward (later King Edward II) as the first Prince of Wales. The building was damaged during the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536 and completely demolished by 1650, only traces of foundations remaining on the site now called Bishop's Palace Field.Bishops Manor, Pastscape, English Heritage The parish church of All Saints dates from the Saxon period, with medieval and 19th century additions. It is now in the benefice of Nettleham with Riseholme and Grange de Lings. Thomas Gardiner's grave in Nettleham churchyard Within the church's graveyard is a headstone in memory of Thomas Gardiner, a post-boy murdered hereabouts by two highway robbers in January 1733. The inscription declares he was 'barbarously murdered' aged 19. The robbers - two brothers by the name of Hallam - committed another murder near Faldingworth before being arrested. They were convicted of murder at Lincoln and executed at the site of their crimes.

It is characterized by the dry and dusty northeasterly trade wind, of the same name, which blows from the Sahara Desert over West Africa into the Gulf of Guinea. The name is related to the word haramata in the Twi language. The temperature is cold in most places, but can also be hot in certain places, depending on local circumstances.Geographical Review (1919): \\"Knox writes of this wind : The Harmattan is experienced as a wind which blows, especially in the months of December, January, and February, from the NE. and is a hot wind in some localities and a cold wind in others, according to circumstances.\\" The Harmattan blows during the dry season, which occurs during the months with the lowest sun. In this season the subtropical ridge of high pressure stays over the central Sahara Desert and the low-pressure Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) stays over the Gulf of Guinea. On its passage over the Sahara, the harmattan picks up fine dust and sand particles (between 0.5 and 10 microns). It is also known as the \\"Doctor wind\\". Effects This season differs from winter, because it is characterized by cold, dry, dust-laden wind, and also wide fluctuations in the ambient temperatures of the day and night. Temperatures can easily be as low as all day, but sometimes in the afternoon the temperature can also soar to as high as , while the relative humidity drops under 5%. It can also be hot in some regions, like in Sahara desert.Climate and Land Degradation (, 2007): \\"At the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert, a special dry and hot wind, locally termed Harmattan, occurs.\\" Harmattan haze over Ho, Ghana The air is particularly dry and desiccating when the Harmattan blows over the region. The Harmattan brings desert-like weather conditions: it lowers the humidity, dissipates cloud cover, prevents rainfall formation and sometimes creates big clouds of dust which can result in dust storms or sandstorms. The wind can increase fire risk and cause severe crop damage. The interaction of the Harmattan with monsoon winds can cause tornadoes. =Harmattan haze= In some countries in West Africa, the heavy amount of dust in the air can severely limit visibility and block the sun for several days, comparable to a heavy fog. This effect is known as the Harmattan haze. It costs airlines millions of dollars in cancelled and diverted flights each year.This Day: Nigerian Civil Aviation warns pilots, airlines of Harmattan haze When the haze is weak, the skies are clear. The extreme dryness of the air may cause branches of trees to die. =Health= Humidity drops to as low as 15%, which can result in spontaneous nosebleeds for some people. Other health effects on humans may include conditions of the skin (dryness of the skin), dried or chapped lips, eyes, and respiratory system, including aggravation of asthma.

He was one of the leading figures of the Irish Literary Revival. Early life John B. Yeats, 1900s Colum was born Patrick Columb in a County Longford workhouse, where his father worked. He was the first of eight children born to Patrick and Susan Columb. When the father lost his job in 1889, he moved to the United States to participate in the Colorado gold rush. Padraic and his mother and siblings remained in Ireland, having moved to live with his grandmother in County Cavan. When the father returned in 1892, the family moved to Glasthule, near Dublin, where his father was employed as Assistant Manager at Sandycove and Glasthule railway station. His son attended the local national school. When Susan Columb died in 1907death records, the family was temporarily split up. Padraic (as he would be known) and one brother remained in Dublin, while their father and remaining children moved back to Longford. Colum finished school the following year and at the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the Irish Railway Clearing House. He stayed in this job until 1903. During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time, including W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory and √Ü. He also joined the Gaelic League and was a member of the first board of the Abbey Theatre. He became a regular user of the National Library of Ireland, where he met James Joyce and the two became lifelong friends. During the riots caused by the Abbey Theatre's production of The Playboy of the Western World, Padraic Colum's father, Patrick Columb, was one of the protestors. Padraic himself was not engaged in the protests, although he did pay his father's fine afterwards. He was awarded a five-year scholarship by a wealthy American benefactor, Thomas Hughes Kelly. He used it to read, study and write. He did not attend University College Dublin, or any other University as a student. Early poetry and plays He was awarded a prize by Cumann na nGaedheal for his anti- enlistment play, The Saxon Shillin'. Through his plays he became involved with the National Theatre Society and became involved in the founding of the Abbey Theatre, writing several of its early productions. His first play, Broken Soil (revised as The Fiddler's House) (1903) was performed by W. G. Fay's Irish National Dramatic Company.Fay: The Fays of the Abbey Theatre. 1935. p. 114 The Land (1905), was one of that theatre's first great public successes. He wrote another important play for the Abbey named Thomas Muskerry (1910). His earliest published poems appeared in The United Irishman, a paper edited by Arthur Griffith. His first book, Wild Earth (1907) collected many of these poems and was dedicated to √Ü. He published several poems in Arthur Griffith's paper, The United Irishman this time, with The Poor Scholar bringing him to the attention of WB Yeats. He became a friend of Yeats and Lady Gregory. In 1908, he wrote an introduction to the Everyman's Library edition of Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination. He collected Irish folk songs, and adapted some of them. In a letter to the Irish Times in April 1970, he claimed to be the author of the words of \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" (the music being composed by Herbert Hughes), using only a single verse from an old Donegal folk song.Colum, Padraic. \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" (letter), The Irish Times, 22 April 1970 In the same correspondence, however, another music collector, Proinsias √ì Conluain, said he had recorded a \\"very old\\" song from Glenavy with words the same as the other three verses of \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\".√ì Conluain, Proinsias. \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\" (letter), The Irish Times, 2 April 1970 In 1911, with Mary Gunning Maguire, a student from UCD, and David Houston and Thomas MacDonagh, he founded the short-lived literary journal The Irish Review, which published work by Yeats, George Moore, Oliver St John Gogarty, and many other leading Revival figures. In 1912 he married Maguire. Padraic taught at P√°draig Pearse's experimental school, Scoil √âanna in Rathfarnham, County Dublin and Mary Maguire taught at the girls' school, Scoil √çde or St. Ita's, which was set up in Cullenswood House, Ranelagh, Dublin, once Scoil √âanna had moved to Rathfarnham. At first the couple lived in the Dublin suburb of Donnybrook, where they held a regular Tuesday literary salon. They then moved to Howth, a small fishing village just to the north of the capital. In 1914, they travelled to the US for what was intended to be a visit of a few months but lasted most the rest of their lives. Later life and work In America, Colum took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with The King of Ireland's Son (1916). This book came about when Colum started translating an Irish folk tale from Gaelic because he did not want to forget the language. After it was published in the New York Tribune, Hungarian Illustrator Willy Pogany suggested the possibility of a book collaboration, so Colum wove the folktale into a long, epic story. Three of his books for children were awarded retrospective citations for the Newbery Honor. A contract for children's literature with Macmillan Publishers made him financially secure for the rest of his life. Some other books he wrote are The Adventure of Odysseus (1918) and The Children of Odin (1920). These works are important for bringing classical literature to children. In 1922 he was commissioned to write versions of Hawaiian folklore for young people. This resulted in the publication of three volumes of his versions of tales from the islands. At the suggestion of Dr P√°draic Whyte (School of English, Trinity College Dublin) a first edition of the first volume (At the Gateways of the Day) was presented to US president Barack Obama by Taoiseach Enda Kenny on the occasion of his visit to Dublin, Ireland on 23 May 2011. Colum also started writing novels. These include Castle Conquer (1923) and The Flying Swans (1937). The spent the years from 1930 to 1933 living in Paris and Nice, where Padraic renewed his friendship with James Joyce and became involved in the transcription of Finnegans Wake. After their time in France, the couple moved to New York City, where they did some teaching at Columbia University and CCNY. Colum was a prolific author and published a total of 61 books, not counting his plays. He adopted the form of Noh drama in his later plays. While in New York, he wrote the screenplay for the 1954 stop-motion animated film Hansel and Gretel. It was his only screenplay. Mary died in 1957 and Padraic finished Our Friend James Joyce, which they had worked on together. It was published in 1958. Colum divided his later years between the United States and Ireland. In 1961 the Catholic Library Association awarded him the Regina Medal. He died in Enfield, Connecticut, age 90, and was buried in St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton. In 1965, Colum sold the notebooks, manuscripts, galley proofs, and letters that were in his apartments in New York and Dublin to the Binghamton University Libraries. He wished to make whatever resources he could available to scholars of Irish literature and history. Asked how to say his name, he told The Literary Digest the last name was the same as the word column. \\"In my first name, the first a has the sound of au.

The Oxford poetry anthologies ('Oxford Books') are traditionally seen as 'establishment' in attitude, and routinely therefore are subjects of discussion and contention. They have been edited both by well-known poets and by distinguished academics. In the limited perspective of canon-formation, they have mostly been retrospective and well-researched, rather than breaking fresh ground.

During the American Revolutionary War he became a lieutenant colonel of artillery in the Continental Army. He distinguished himself as quartermaster general in General Nathanael Greene‚Äôs southern campaign. He commanded artillery at Monmouth and Yorktown. He was also present at Cowpens, Guilford Court House, and Hobkirk's Hill. During the war he became a close friend of George Washington. Carrington served in the 3rd Continental Congress and was the first US Marshal appointed from his state. He was an original member of the Society of the Cincinnati. Family Edward Carrington was born on February 11, 1748 on Boston Hill Plantation near the town of Cartersville in old Goochland County, Virginia, later split off into Cumberland County, Virginia. He was the eighth of the 11 children of George Carrington and Anne Mayo. His father George arrived in Virginia in 1727 from Barbados and married Anne around 1732 when he was 21 and she was 20. Edward married Elizabeth Ambler (1765‚Äì1842) and the couple had no children. He was Elizabeth's second husband; her first husband William Brent died. Edward's oldest brother Paul Carrington became an eminent jurist. Revolutionary War =1775‚Äì1777= Carrington studied the law and opened a law practice. He also managed a plantation in southern Virginia. In 1775‚Äì76 he became a member of the Goochland County Revolutionary Committee. On December 1, 1775, the state of Virginia established an artillery company. On February 13, 1776 the state authorities appointed James Innes the captain and Charles Harrison, Samuel Denney, and Carrington as lieutenants. the Continental Congress accepted the artillery unit into the Continental Army on March 19 and requested a second company from Virginia to be formed. Innes soon transferred to the infantry. In late 1776, George Washington ordered his artillery chief Henry Knox to begin organizing three artillery regiments to support the Continental Army. Harrison's Continental Artillery Regiment was authorized on 26 November 1776 and assigned to the Southern Department. The regiment was to expand from the two existing companies to a total of ten companies. Harrison was appointed the regiment's colonel while Carrington became lieutenant colonel and second in command. Each company consisted of four officers, one sergeant, four corporals, four bombardiers, eight gunners, and 48 matrosses. The regiment garrisoned Virginia during 1777. =1778‚Äì1780= On March 13, 1778, Harrison's Regiment was transferred to the main army. Carrington performed with distinction in the Battle of Monmouth on June 28. Beginning in the early afternoon and continuing for two hours, 10‚Äì14 American field guns dueled with eight British cannons and two howitzers. Carrington's guns were placed on the American left flank under William Alexander, Lord Stirling's command. On August 10, 1779, Harrison's Regiment was renamed the 1st Continental Artillery Regiment. In March 1780, Carrington served with Arthur St. Clair, and Alexander Hamilton as commissioners for a prisoner exchange. On April 17, 1780 the 1st Artillery Regiment was assigned to the Southern Department. Carrington was sent south in command of three artillery companies with Johann de Kalb's forces. Harrison unexpectedly joined De Kalb and assumed command of the gunners when the force reached North Carolina, leaving Carrington unemployed. On July 25, Horatio Gates superseded De Kalb in command and gave Carrington a new assignment. Gates ordered him to investigate the best points to cross the Roanoke River for supplying the American forces and finding the best retreat routes. The American army led by Gates was smashed in the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780. Nathanael Greene assumed command of the American southern army on December 3. The new leader ordered Carrington to continue reconnoitering possible routes of withdrawal, an action that historian Mark M. Boatner III wrote would \\"prove decisive\\". Greene split his army into three parts: 600 led by Daniel Morgan, 1,100 under Isaac Huger at Cheraw, South Carolina, and light troops commanded by \\"Light Horse\\" Harry Lee. Greene appointed Carrington the quartermaster general. At that time there was no money in the military chest, yet the army was kept supplied. Among his new duties was an examination of the Dan River which is the southern branch of the Roanoke. Lee later wrote a glowing account of Carrington's successful execution of this duty. =1781‚Äì1783= Historian Boatner believed that, \\"this advance planning enabled Carrington to propose a course of action that probably saved the Southern army\\". On January 17, 1781, in the Battle of Cowpens, an 1,100-man American force under Morgan wrecked an equal-sized British force led by Banastre Tarleton. The Americans inflicted losses of 100 killed, 229 wounded, and 600 captured on the British while reporting only 12 killed and 60 wounded. Carrington was present at the battle. Sending his column of prisoners to Virginia, Morgan quickly left the scene of his stunning triumph and raced to join Greene's forces. Greene realized that Lord Charles Cornwallis would soon be after Morgan with the main British army. He decided to retreat toward Virginia in the hope that Cornwallis would follow. Greene ordered Carrington to assemble boats on the Dan River and instructed his separate columns under Morgan, Lee, and Huger to head north for a rendezvous. On February 1, 1781, Tarleton's cavalry crossed the Catawba River and dispersed the North Carolina militia in actions at Cowan's Ford and Torrence's Tavern. On February 2, Morgan found boats waiting for him at Trading Ford on the Yadkin River; that night his troops crossed. On February 7, Morgan, Huger, and Lee rendezvoused at Guilford Court House, North Carolina. At this time, both Greene and Cornwallis were roughly the same distance from Dix's Ferry on the Dan River. Carrington recommended that the American army cross the Dan downstream at Irwin's Ferry and farther at Boyd's Ferry. The proposal was adopted and Carrington arranged to move the boats to the downstream crossings. A 700-man rearguard was organized to hold off Cornwallis. Since Morgan insisted on leaving the army on account of his health, Otho Williams assumed command of the rearguard. On February 10, Greene's army left Guilford Court House and marched toward the two crossings suggested by Carrington, to the northeast. For two days, Williams succeeded in blocking Cornwallis from finding out the true direction of Greene's retreat. By the morning of February 13, Tarleton had determined Greene's real line of retreat. Sending his vanguard on the same road to deceive the Americans, Cornwallis suddenly shifted his main body to a road farther east. Carrington's boats were now all at Irwin's and Boyd's ferries, so he took command of the cavalry detachment watching the British vanguard. Carrington noted that the British vanguard had slowed down and this, combined with other intelligence, confirmed Cornwallis' change of direction. Both armies raced along with hardly a rest, the Americans trying to reach Boyd's Ferry and hold back their foes while the British tried to overrun them. At noon on February 14, Williams received a welcome message from Greene that the American main body had crossed the Dan and was safely on the north bank. At 9 pm, the last American cavalry crossed the Dan at Boyd's Ferry with Lee and Carrington in the last boat. Blocked by high water and lacking boats, Cornwallis pulled back to Hillsborough, North Carolina. Carrington was present at the Battle of Guilford Court House a few weeks later. On April 19, Greene's army approached the British force under Lord Francis Rawdon at Camden, South Carolina. Deciding that Rawdon's defenses were too strong, Greene took up a position on Hobkirk's Hill to the north of Camden. On 22 April, Greene shifted his position and sent his cannons north to a secure location. When Greene returned to Hobkirk's Hill on 24 April, Rawdon received intelligence that the Americans were without artillery and low on food. On the morning of April 25, 1781, Carrington arrived in the American camp with the artillery and provisions. That day, Rawdon advanced and won the Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, but during its early stages he was unpleasantly surprised when Harrison's three 6-pound cannons suddenly opened fire. In July 1781, Greene granted Carrington leave to try to fill the vacancy in the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment after Thomas Proctor resigned in April. Greene filled the quartermaster general position with a deputy in case Carrington returned. During the Siege of Yorktown, Carrington, Ebenezer Stevens, and John Lamb rotated responsibility as Henry Knox's chief assistant. It is not clear if Carrington exercised direct command over Whitehead Coleman's company of the 1st Artillery or the three companies of the 4th Artillery present at Yorktown. Since he never received promotion, Carrington resumed his post as quartermaster general under Greene in the summer of 1782 and served in that capacity until the end of the war. Later career Carrington served as treasurer at the first meeting of Virginia's Society of the Cincinnati on October 9, 1783. During the war, Carrington became a friend and confidant of George Washington. Virginia sent Carrington as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1786 to 1788. (Boatner states that it was 1785‚Äì1787.) He often visited Washington at Mount Vernon during this period. After being elected president, Washington appointed Carrington as the first U.S. Marshal for Virginia, a position he held from 1789 until March 1791. He then served as Virginia's supervisor of the revenue from 1791 to 1794. The new president often sought Carrington's advice on political matters. During his second term, President Washington offered Carrington the posts of Attorney General and Secretary of War, which were declined. In 1797, Washington wrote a letter to Carrington stating that he had just hosted the future Supreme Court Justice John Marshall. He noted that Marshall approved of an improved threshing machine by a Mr. Booker. Washington wrote that he was sending a letter to Booker and asked that Carrington forward it to that individual. In 1798, President John Adams selected Carrington to be the quartermaster general for the United States Army during the Quasi-War with France, but the position was never filled and was eliminated when normal relations were restored. In 1807, Carrington was foreman of the jury during Aaron Burr's treason trial. His brother-in-law John Marshall was the presiding judge and Burr was acquitted. Carrington died on October 28, 1810 at Richmond, Virginia. In 1775, while listening to Patrick Henry's famous \\"Give me liberty or give me death speech\\" while standing outside a window at St. John's Church where the speech was given, he turned to his turned to his friends and whispered, \\"Boys, bury me here, in this very spot!\\" Per his wishes, he is buried just outside that window.

It was first introduced by Nicholas Kaldor in 1966 in his article \\"Marginal Productivity and the Macro-Economic Theories of Distribution: Comment on Samuelson and Modigliani\\".American Economic Association Biography of William C. Brainard: http://www.aeaweb.org/PDF_files/Bios/Brainard_bio.pdf. It was popularised a decade later, however, by James Tobin, who describes its two quantities (1977): > One, the numerator, is the market valuation: the going price in the market > for exchanging existing assets. The other, the denominator, is the > replacement or reproduction cost: the price in the market for newly produced > commodities. We believe that this ratio has considerable macroeconomic > significance and usefulness, as the nexus between financial markets and > markets for goods and services.\\"Asset Markets and the Cost of Capital.\\" > James Tobin and W.C. Brainard, 1977, Economic Progress, Private Values and > Public Policy Measurement =Single company= Although it is not the direct equivalent of Tobin's q, it has become common practice in the finance literature to calculate the ratio by comparing the market value of a company's equity and liabilities with its corresponding book values, as the replacement values of a company's assets is hard to estimate: :Tobin's q = \\\\frac{\\\\text{(Equity Market Value + Liabilities Market Value)}}{\\\\text{(Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value)}} It is also common practice to assume equivalence of the liabilities market and book value, yielding: :Tobin's q = \\\\frac{\\\\text{(Equity Market Value + Liabilities Book Value)}}{\\\\text{(Equity Book Value + Liabilities Book Value)}}. Even if market and book value of liabilities are assumed to be equal, this is not equal to the \\"Market to Book Ratio\\" or \\"Price to Book Ratio\\", used in financial analysis. The latter ratio is only calculated for equity values: Market to Book Ratio= \\\\frac{\\\\text{Equity Market Value}}{\\\\text{Equity Book Value}}. Financial analysis also often uses the inverse of this ratio, the \\"Book to Market Ratio\\", i.e. Book to Market Ratio= \\\\frac{\\\\text{Equity Book Value}}{\\\\text{Equity Market Value}} For stock-listed companies, the market value of equity or market capitalization is often quoted in financial databases. It can be calculated for a specific point in time by \\\\text{number of shares} \\\\times \\\\text{share price}. =Aggregate corporations= Another use for q is to determine the valuation of the whole market in ratio to the aggregate corporate assets. The formula for this is: q=\\\\frac{\\\\text{value of stock market}}{\\\\text{corporate net worth}} The following graph is an example of Tobin's q for all U.S. corporations. The line shows the ratio of the US stock market value to US net assets at replacement cost since 1900. File:Tobin's Q graph.pngSource of data: Valuing Wall Street. The data from 1952 on comes from the \\"Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States Z1‚Äù, which is published quarterly by the Federal Reserve. Earlier data are available from a variety of sources from 1900 as compiled by Stephen Wright, University of London Effect on capital investment If the market value reflected solely the recorded assets of a company, Tobin's q would be 1.0. If Tobin's q is greater than 1.0, then the market value is greater than the value of the company's recorded assets. This suggests that the market value reflects some unmeasured or unrecorded assets of the company. High Tobin's q values encourage companies to invest more in capital because they are \\"worth\\" more than the price they paid for them. :q = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Market value of installed capital}}{\\\\text{Replacement cost of capital}} If a company's stock price (which is a measure of the company's capital market value) is $2 and the price of the capital in the current market is $1, so that q > 1, the company can issue shares and with the proceeds invest in capital, thus obtaining economic profit. On the other hand, if Tobin's q is less than 1, the market value is less than the recorded value of the assets of the company. This suggests that the market may be undervaluing the company, or that the company could increase profit by getting rid of some capital stock, either by selling it or by declining to replace it as it wears out. John Mihaljevic points out that \\"no straightforward balancing mechanism exists in the case of low Q ratios, i.e., when the market is valuing an asset below its replacement cost (Q<1). When Q is less than parity, the market seems to be saying that the deployed real assets will not earn a sufficient rate of return and that, therefore, the owners of such assets must accept a discount to the replacement value if they desire to sell their assets in the market. If the real assets can be sold off at replacement cost, for example via an asset liquidation, such an action would be beneficial to shareholders because it would drive the Q ratio back up toward parity (Q->1). In the case of the stock market as a whole, rather than a single firm, the conclusion that assets should be liquidated does not typically apply. A low Q ratio for the entire market does not mean that blanket redeployment of resources across the economy will create value. Instead, when market-wide Q is less than parity, investors are probably being overly pessimistic about future asset returns.\\" Lang and Stulz found out that diversified companies have a lower q-ratio than focused firms because the market penalizes the value of the firm assets. Tobin's insights show that movements in stock prices will be reflected in changes in consumption and investment, although empirical evidence shows that the relationship is not as tight as one would have thought. This is largely because firms do not blindly base fixed investment decisions on movements in the stock price; rather they examine future interest rates and the present value of expected profits. Other influences on q Tobin's q measures two variables - the current price of capital assets as measured by accountants or statisticians and the market value of equity and bonds - but there are other elements that may affect the value of q, namely: * Market hype and speculation, reflecting, for example, analysts' views of the prospects for companies, or speculation such as bid rumors. * The \\"intellectual capital\\" of corporations, that is, the unmeasured contribution of knowledge, goodwill, technology and other intangible assets that a company may have but aren't recorded by accountants. Some companies seek to develop ways to measure intangible assets such as intellectual capital. See balanced scorecard. Tobin's q is said to be influenced by market hype and intangible assets so that we see swings in q around the value of 1. Nicholas Kaldor and the determination of Kaldor's v and Tobin's q In his 1966 paper \\"Marginal Productivity and the Macro-Economic Theory of Distribution: Comment on Samuelson and Modigliani\\" co-authored with Luigi Pasinetti, Nicholas Kaldor introduced this relationship as part of his broader theory of distribution that was non-marginalist. This theory is today known as the ‚ÄòCambridge Growth Model‚Äô after the location (University of Cambridge, UK) where the theories was devised. In the paper Kaldor writes: > The \\"valuation ratio\\" (v) [is] the relation of the market value of shares to > the capital employed by corporations.\\" Kaldor then goes on to explore the properties of v at a properly macroeconomic level. He ends up deriving the following equation: where c is net consumption out of capital, sw is the savings of workers, g is the growth rate, Y is income, k is capital, sc is savings out of capital and i is the fraction of new securities issued by firms. Kaldor then supplements this with a price, p, equation for securities which is as follows: He then goes on to lay out his interpretation of these equations: > The interpretation of these equations is as follows. Given the savings- > coefficients and the capital-gains-coefficient, there will be a certain > valuation ratio which will secure just enough savings by the personal sector > to take up the new securities issued by corporations. Hence the net savings > of the personal sector (available for investment by the business sector) > will depend, not only on the savings propensities of individuals, but on the > policies of corporations towards new issues. In the absence of new issues > the level of security prices will be established at the point at which the > purchases of securities by the savers will be balanced by the sale of > securities of the dis-savers, making the net savings of the personal sector > zero. The issue of new securities by corporations will depress security > prices (i.e. the valuation ratio v) just enough to reduce the sale of > securities by the dis-savers sufficiently to induce the net savings required > to take up the new issues. If i were negative and the corporations were net > purchasers of securities from the personal sector (which they could be > through the redemption of past securities, or purchasing shares from the > personal sector for the acquisition of subsidiaries) the valuation ratio v > would be driven up to the point at which net personal savings would be > negative to the extent necessary to match the sale of securities by the > personal sector. Kaldor is clearly laying out equilibrium condition by which, ceteris paribus, the stock of savings in existence at any given time is matched to the total numbers of securities outstanding in the market. He goes on to state: > In a state of Golden Age equilibrium (given a constant g and a constant K/Y, > however determined), v will be constant, with a value that can be ><1, > depending on the values of sc, sw, c, and i. In this sentence Kaldor is laying out the determination of the v ratio in equilibrium (a constant g and a constant K/Y) by: the savings out of capital, the savings of workers, net consumption out of capital and the issuance of new shares by firms. Kaldor goes further still. Prior to this he had asserted that \\"the share of investment in total income is higher than the share of savings in wages, or in total personal income\\" is a \\"matter of fact\\" (i.e. a matter of empirical investigation that Kaldor thought would likely hold true). This is the so-called \\"Pasinetti inequality\\" and if we allow for it we can say something more concrete about the determination of v: > [One] can assert that, given the Pasinetti inequality, gK>sw.Y, v<1 when > c=(1-sw). i=0; with i>0 this will be true a fortiori. This fits nicely with the fact that Kaldor's v and Tobin's q tend on average to be below 1 thus suggesting that Pasinetti's inequality likely does hold in empirical reality. Finally, Kaldor considers whether this exercise give us any clue to the future development of income distribution in the capitalist system. The neoclassicals tended to argue that capitalism would eventually liquidate the capitalists and lead to more homogenous income distribution. Kaldor lays out a case whereby this might take place in his framework: > Has this \\"neo-Pasinetti theorem\\" any very-long-run \\"Pasinetti\\" or \\"anti- > Pasinetti\\" solution? So far we have not taken any account of the change in > distribution of assets between \\"workers\\" (i.e. pension funds) and > \\"capitalists\\" - indeed we assumed it to be constant. However since the > capitalists are selling shares (if c>0) and the pension funds are buying > them, one could suppose that the share of total assets in the hands of the > capitalists would diminish continually, whereas the share of assets in the > hands of the workers' funds would increase continuously until, at some > distant day, the capitalists have no shares left; the pension funds and > insurance companies would own them all!. While this is a possible interpretation of the analysis Kaldor warns against it and lays out an alternative interpretation of the results: > But this view ignores that the ranks of the capitalist class are constantly > renewed by the sons and daughters of the new Captains of Industry, replacing > the grandsons and granddaughters of the older Captains who gradually > dissipate their inheritance through living beyond their dividend income. It > is reasonable to assume that the value of the shares of the newly formed and > growing companies grows at a higher rate than the average, whilst those of > older companies (which decline in relative importance) grow at a lower rate. > This means that the rate of capital appreciation of the shares in the hands > of the capitalist group as a whole, for the reasons given above, is greater > than the rate of appreciation of the assets in the hands of pension funds, > etc. Given the difference in the rates of appreciation of the two funds of > securities-and this depends on the rate at which new corporations emerge and > replace older ones-I think it can be shown that there will be, for any given > constellation of the value of the parameters, a long run equilibrium > distribution of the assets between capitalists and pension funds which will > remain constant. Kaldor's theory of v is comprehensive and provides an equilibrium determination of the variable based on macroeconomic theory that was missing in most other discussions. But today it is largely neglected and the focus is placed on Tobin's later contribution - hence the fact that the variable is known as Tobin's q and not Kaldor's v.  Cassel's q  In September 1996, at a lunch at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), attended by Tobin, Mark Cutis of the EBRD and Brian Reading and Gabriel Stein of Lombard Street Research Ltd, Tobin mentioned that \\"in common with most American economists, [he] did not read anything in a foreign language] and that \\"in common with most post-War economists [he] did not read anything published before World War II\\". He was therefore greatly embarrassed when he discovered that in the 1920s, the Swedish economist Gustav Cassel, had introduced a ratio between a physical asset's market value and its replacement value, which he called 'q'. Cassel's q thus antedates both Kaldor's and Tobin's by a number of decades.  Tobin's marginal q  Tobin's marginal q is the ratio of the market value of an additional unit of capital to its replacement cost. Price-to-book ratio (P/B) In inflationary times, q will be lower than the price-to-book ratio.Damodaran A (2002). Investment valuation: Tools and techniques for determining the value of any asset valuation (Google Book Search). New York: Wiley () During periods of very high inflation, the book value would understate the cost of replacing a firm's assets, since the inflated prices of its assets would not be reflected on its balance sheet. Criticism Olivier Blanchard, Changyong Rhee and Lawrence Summers found with data of the US economy from the 1920s to the 1990s that \\"fundamentals\\" predict investment much better than Tobin's q. What these authors call fundamentals is however the rate of profit, which connects these empirical findings with older ideas of authors such as Wesley Mitchell, or even Karl Marx, that profits are the basic engine of the market economy. Doug Henwood, in his book Wall Street, argues that the q ratio fails to accurately predict investment, as Tobin claims. \\"The data for Tobin and Brainard‚Äôs 1977 paper covers 1960 to 1974, a period for which q seemed to explain investment pretty well,\\" he writes. \\"But as the chart [see right] shows, things started going away even before the paper was published. While q and investment seemed to move together for the first half of the chart, they part ways almost at the middle; q collapsed during the bearish stock markets of the 1970s, yet investment rose.\\" (p. 145) See also *P/E ratio *Dividend yield *List of finance topics Notes References Further reading Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset External links *Tobin's Q Moderately Bullish on U.S. Equities (as of March 2009) *The Manual of Ideas Launches Tobin's Q Research Service Based on James Tobin's Q Indicator *Robert Huebscher on \\"The Market Valuation Q-uestion\\" *Andrew Smithers' Q-Ratio FAQ *Q-Ratio Graphs and Data Financial ratios ","title":"Tobin's q"},{"id":"987605","text":"Ramanagara is a city and a city municipal council in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is also the headquarters of Ramanagara district. It is approximately 45 kilometers from Bangalore. There is bus and train public transportation which approximately takes 90 minutes from Bangalore. Famous Bollywood movie Sholay was shot in 1975 at the surrounding hills of Ramanagara now called Ramagiri hills but also has nick name of Sholay hills. The town was known as Shamserabad at the ruling time of Tippu Sultan. It was called Closepet, after Sir Barry Close (1756‚Äì1813) in pre-Independence times. This name is retained in geology. Then Closepet was called Ramanagara. Ramanagara's name was based on the historical story of the Ramayana.  Demographics  India census, Ramanagara had a population of 79,365. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Ramanagara has an average literacy rate of 63%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 67%, and female literacy is 58%. In Ramanagara, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. Figures for the district, which was carved out of Bangalore Rural in September 2007, are not available as yet. Now it is changed to Ramanagara district.  Economy  Street view of Ramnagara Ramanagara is well known for its sericulture, and is nicknamed Silk Town and Silk City . The silk produced in this region forms the input for the famous Mysore Silk. Ramanagara is the largest market for silk cocoons in Asia. 50 tonnes of cocoon a day arrive at the town. Ramanagar has extensive granite sites.  Closepet granites  Ramanagara Hills Distribution of the Closepet granites The Closepet granites are a major geological feature of this region and are from the Lower Proterozoic era. This belt of rocks extends in the north-south direction in 50 km belt. This belt has younger potassic granites and is believed to separate two distinct crustal blocks of Archaean age. The block to the west has low- grade granite-greenstone belts with iron-manganese ores and to the east are younger gneisses of granitic and granodioritic composition with gold-bearing schist belts.Atomic minerals directorate  See also  * Climbing locations in India  References   External links  * Bangalore rural district - taluk page Climbing areas of India ","title":"Ramanagara"},{"id":"987608","text":"A map of West Antarctica bathymetric map of Antarctica without its ice sheets, assuming constant sea levels and no post-glacial rebound A collage of footage and animation to explain the changes that are occurring on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, narrated by glaciologist Eric Rignot The Western Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is the segment of the continental ice sheet that covers West (or Lesser) Antarctica, the portion of Antarctica on the side of the Transantarctic Mountains which lies in the Western Hemisphere. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies well below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea. General It is estimated that the volume of the Antarctic ice sheet is about 25.4 million km3 (6.1 million cu mi), and the WAIS contains just under 10% of this, or 2.2 million km3 (530,000 cu mi). The weight of the ice has caused the underlying rock to sink by between in a process known as isostatic depression. Under the force of its own weight, the ice sheet deforms and flows. The interior ice flows slowly over rough bedrock. In some circumstances, ice can flow faster in ice streams, separated by slow-flowing ice ridges. The inter-stream ridges are frozen to the bed while the bed beneath the ice streams consists of water-saturated sediments. Many of these sediments were deposited before the ice sheet occupied the region, when much of West Antarctica was covered by the ocean. The rapid ice-stream flow is a non-linear process still not fully understood; streams can start and stop for unclear reasons. When ice reaches the coast, it either calves or continues to flow outward onto the water. The result is a large, floating ice shelf affixed to the continent.Ice Shelves, Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition Ice mass loss Indications that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass at an increasing rate come from the Amundsen Sea sector, and three glaciers in particular: the Pine Island, Thwaites and Smith Glaciers. Data reveals they are losing more ice than is being replaced by snowfall. According to a preliminary analysis, the difference between the mass lost and mass replaced is about 60%. The melting of these three glaciers alone is contributing an estimated per year to the rise in the worldwide sea level. There is growing evidence that this trend is accelerating: there has been a 75% increase in Antarctic ice mass loss in the ten years 1996‚Äì2006, with glacier acceleration a primary cause. As of November 2012 the total mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is estimated at mainly from the Amundsen Sea coast. Satellite measurements by ESA's CryoSat-2 revealed that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is losing more than of ice each year. The loss is especially pronounced at grounding lines, the area where the floating ice shelf meets the part resting on bedrock, and hence affects the ice shelf stability and flow rates. =Potential collapse= Large parts of the WAIS sit on a bed which is both below sea level and sloping downward inland.In this case, the ice is effectively moving upslope towards the sea. This slope, and the low isostatic head, mean that the ice sheet is theoretically unstable: a small retreat could in theory destabilize the entire WAIS, leading to rapid disintegration. Current computer models do not account well for the complicated and uncertain physics necessary to simulate this process, and observations do not provide guidance, so predictions as to its rate of retreat remain uncertain. This has been known for decades. In January 2006, in a UK government-commissioned report, the head of the British Antarctic Survey, Chris Rapley, warned that this huge West Antarctic Ice Sheet may be starting to disintegrate. It has been hypothesised that this disintegration could raise sea levels by approximately . (If the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt, this would contribute to global sea level.) Rapley said a previous (2001) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that played down the worries of the ice sheet's stability should be revised. \\"I would say it is now an awakened giant. There is real concern.\\" Jenny Hogan, \\"Antarctic ice sheet is an 'awakened giant'\\", New Scientist, February 2, 2005 Rapley said, \\"Parts of the Antarctic ice sheet that rest on bedrock below sea level have begun to discharge ice fast enough to make a significant contribution to sea level rise. Understanding the reason for this change is urgent in order to be able to predict how much ice may ultimately be discharged and over what timescale. Current computer models do not include the effect of liquid water on ice sheet sliding and flow, and so provide only conservative estimates of future behaviour.\\" \\"West Antarctic ice sheet: Waking the sleeping giant?\\", Symposium, February 19, 2006 Polar ice experts from the US and UK met at the University of Texas at Austin in March, 2007 for the West Antarctic Links to Sea-Level Estimation (WALSE) Workshop. The experts discussed a new hypothesis that explains the observed increased melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. They proposed that changes in air circulation patterns have led to increased upwelling of warm, deep ocean water along the coast of Antarctica and that this warm water has increased melting of floating ice shelves at the edge of the ice sheet. An ocean model has shown how changes in winds can help channel the water along deep troughs on the sea floor, toward the ice shelves of outlet glaciers. The exact cause of the changes in circulation patterns is not known and they may be due to natural variability. However, this connection between the atmosphere and upwelling of deep ocean water provides a mechanism by which human induced climate changes could cause an accelerated loss of ice from the WAIS. Recently published data collected from satellites support this hypothesis, suggesting that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is beginning to show signs of instability.Kaufman, Mark (2008) \\"Escalating Ice Loss Found in Antarctica: Sheets Melting in an Area Once Thought to Be Unaffected by Global Warming\\" Washington Post (January 14) p. A01 online On 12 May 2014, it was announced that two teams of scientists said the long-feared collapse of the Ice Sheet had begun, kicking off what they say will be a centuries-long, \\"unstoppable\\" process that could raise sea levels by Justin Gillis (March 30, 2016) \\"Climate Model Predicts West Antarctic Ice Sheet Could Melt Rapidly\\" New York Times They estimate that rapid drawdown of Thwaites Glacier will begin in 200 ‚Äì 1000 years. (Scientific source articles: Rignot et al. 2014 and Joughin et al. 2014.) In 2016, improved computer modeling revealed that the breakup of glaciers could lead to a steep rise in sea levels much more quickly than previously projected. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in danger of handing young people a situation that‚Äôs out of their control,‚Äù according to James E. Hansen, the leader of a number of climate scientists who worked together to compile the study.Justin Gillis (March 22, 2016) \\"Scientists Warn of Perilous Climate Shift Within Decades, Not Centuries\\" New York Times In 2018, scientists concluded that high sea levels some 125,000 years ago, which were 6‚Äì9 m (20‚Äì30 ft) higher than today, were most likely due to the absence of the WAIS, and found evidence that the ice sheet collapsed under climate conditions similar to those of today. Warming The West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) has warmed by more than /decade in the last fifty years, and the warming is the strongest in winter and spring. Although this is partly offset by fall cooling in East Antarctica, this effect was restricted to the 1980s and 1990s. The continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is positive and statistically significant at >/decade since 1957. This warming of WAIS is strongest in the Antarctic Peninsula. In 2012, the temperature records for the ice sheet were reanalyzed with a conclusion that since 1958, the West Antarctic ice sheet had warmed by , almost double the previous estimate. Some scientists now fear that the WAIS could now collapse like the Larsen B Ice Shelf did in 2002. The possible disastrous outcome of a disintegration of the WAIS for global sea levels has been mentioned and assessed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report but was left out in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Jessica O'Reilly, Naomi Oreskes and Michael Oppenheimer discussed the case in a Social Studies of Science paper 2012. According to them, IPCC authors were less certain about potential WAIS disintegration not only due to external new science results. As well pure internal \\"cultural\\" reasons, as changes of staff within the IPCC and externally, made it too difficult to project the range of possible futures for the WAIS as required.The Rapid Disintegration of Projections: The West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Jessica O'Reilly Naomi Oreskes, Michael Oppenheimer Social Studies of Science June 26, 2012, doi: 10.1177/0306312712448130 Mike Hulme saw the issue as a showcase to urge for the integration of minority views in the IPCC and other major assessment processes.Mike Hulme, \\"Lessons from the IPCC: do scientific assessments need to be consensual to be authoritative?\\" in (eds.)

As well as producing and presenting new plays many of which go on to tour nationally and internationally, it seeks out and nurtures creative talent and runs a large education programme for young people.  History  Originally founded in Tyneside in 1973 by Val McLane, Geoff Gillham and Dave Clark,Val McLane ‚Äì Independent Northern Publishers The company originally toured its work regionally to non-traditional theatre settings, such as community halls and working men's clubs. The company was creating plays and stories that were relevant to the North East community and sought to break down barriers by presenting this work to ordinary working-class people within their own communities. The company has been based in Newcastle Quayside since 1982, expanding over the years to occupy the current premises which combine converted warehouses and Almshouses to create a building which houses a theatre auditorium, caf√© bar, rehearsal spaces and administrative offices. Live Theatre also took over the lease of a new warehouse building on Broad Chare, immediately adjacent to the previous theatre. In 2007 Live Theatre underwent a further capital development. It now has a cabaret style theatre, a studio theatre, renovated rehearsal rooms, a series of dedicated writer's rooms as well as a caf√©, bar and gastro pub, The Broad Chare, all in a restored and refurbished complex of five Grade II listed buildings.  Productions  Live Theatre develops new writing talent in the region. The company has enjoyed significant relationships with many writers such as CP Taylor, Tom Hadaway, Alan Plater and, more recently, Peter Flannery, Michael Chaplin, Peter Straughan, Julia Darling, Lee Hall, Sean O'Brien and Karen Laws. Many plays have been commissioned and produced over the years which are now known nationally and internationally, such as Close The Coalhouse Door, Cooking with Elvis, Operation Elvis and And a Nightingale Sang. In 2013 Live Theatre celebrated 40 years of creating plays on Tyneside with a programme that included a new national tour of Lee Hall's The Pitmen Painters by Bill Kenwright Limited, and sell out runs at Live Theatre of Tyne by Michael Chaplin, Wet House by new talent Paddy Campbell and a revival of Lee Hall's Cooking with Elvis.

All were read as script-in-hand readings in Live Theatre's main theatre. Incognito by Nick Payne was a co- production between Live Theatre, nabokov, HighTide Festival Theatre and in association with The North Wall, Oxford in spring 2014, which previewed at Live Theatre in April 2014, before going to HighTide Festival and The North Wall.

The ensemble comprises three sculptures: The Table of Silence (Masa tƒÉcerii), The Gate of the Kiss (Poarta sƒÉrutului) and the Endless Column, (Coloana fƒÉrƒÉ sf√¢r»ôit) on an axis 1.3 km ( mile) long, oriented west to east. The ensemble is considered to be one of the great works of 20th-century outdoor sculpture. History The monument was commissioned by the National League of Gorj Women to honor those soldiers who had defended T√¢rgu Jiu in 1916 from the forces of the Central Powers. Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi (1876‚Äì1957) was at the time living in Paris, but welcomed the opportunity to create a large commemorative sculpture in his homeland. He accepted the commission in 1935, but refused to receive payment for it. Endless Column The Endless Column in T√¢rgu Jiu. The Endless Column symbolizes the concept of infinity and the infinite sacrifice of the Romanian soldiers. The Endless Column stacks 15 rhomboidal modules, with a half-unit at the top and bottom, making a total of 16. The incomplete top unit is thought to be the element that expresses the concept of the infinite. Br√¢ncu»ôi had experimented with this form as early as 1918, with an oak version now found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.MoMA The Collection Constantin Brancusi. Endless Column. version I, 1918 The modules were made in the central workshop of Petro»ôani (Atelierele Centrale Petro»ôani), assembled by Br√¢ncu»ôi's friend engineer »òtefan Georgescu-Gorjan (1905‚Äì1985), and completed on 27 October 1938. All 16 rhomboidal modules accumulate a total height of 29.3 m. In the 1950s, the Romanian communist government planned to demolish the column and turn it into scrap metal, but this plan was never executed. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the fall of the Communist regime, there was renewed interest in restoring the column, which by that time suffered from tilting, cracking, metal corrosion, and an unstable foundation. For these reasons the site was listed in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund. The restoration was facilitated by the Fund, which organized meetings for the stakeholders in 1998 and provided funding through American Express. Subsequently, the site was restored between 1998 and 2000 through a collaborative effort of the Romanian Government, the World Monuments Fund, the World Bank, and other Romanian and international groups. Ensemble Two other pieces constitute the Ensemble. The Table of Silence is a circular stone table surrounded by twelve hourglass- seats, which symbolize time. The Table of Silence represents the moment before the battle on which the combatants were going to participate. Nevertheless, the seats are not located close to the edges of the table. The Gate of the Kiss, of Banpotoc travertine (marble), features a kiss motif on the gate pillars. The transition to another life occurs through The Gate of the Kiss. The Ensemble was inaugurated on 27 October 1938. During the socialist Realism epoch, Br√¢ncu»ôi had been challenged as an exponent of \\"cosmopolitan bourgeois formalism\\". However, in 1964 Br√¢ncu»ôi was \\"rediscovered\\" in Romania as a national genius, and consequently, the Ensemble of T√¢rgu Jiu was restored, after a long period of degradation.

It supports the 335 MW Kurobe No. 4 Hydropower Plant and is owned by Kansai Electric Power Company. At in height, it is the tallest dam in Japan. It was constructed between 1956 and 1963 at a cost of ¬•51.3 billion yen. The project was a difficult engineering feat for the rapidly growing post‚ÄìWorld War II Japan, and claimed the lives of 171 people. History Concrete bucket used during construction In 1951, the Kansai Electric Power Company was formed to provide electric power for the Kansai region of Japan. Shortly after their formation, the area suffered from drought which caused power rationing. The drought along with the rapid growth of post‚ÄìWorld War II Japan pushed the company to increase their generating capacity. After a series of geological and hydrological studies of the Kurobe River and Gorge, it was announced in late 1955 that the Kurobe Dam would be constructed. In July 1956, construction on the dam began. Problems quickly arose while transporting material to the construction site as only one small railway existed through the narrow gorge. Kansai decided to construct the Kanden Tunnel under Mount Akazawa that could bring supplies from ≈åmachi eastward towards the construction site. The tunnel proved an arduous task as a large fracture zone in the rock was encountered which took seven months to repair. In September 1959, the first concrete for the dam was placed and by October of the next year, the reservoir had begun to fill. The Kurobe No. 4 power station was built completely underground to protect it from common avalanches in the gorge and also for nature conservation purposes. By January 1961, two of Kurobe No. 4's Pelton turbines had begun operation at an initial capacity of 154 MW. In August 1962, the third turbine was in operation and by June 1963, the dam was complete at a final cost of ¬• 51.3 billion ($142.5 million (1963)). In 1973, a fourth turbine was installed and became operational; bringing the power station's production capacity to 335 MW. The fourth turbine cost ¬• 1.4 billion yen ($5 million (1973)). The first two turbines were manufactured by Voith and the second two by Japan's Hitachi. The dam initiated the development of Japan's first 275kV transmission system as well which allowed the transfer of electricity over greater distances. A total of 171 people died during the construction of the dam. Specifications Lake Kurobe The Kurobe Dam is a long and high, with variable-radius (dome) arch dam. The dam is wide at its base, wide at its crest and contains of concrete. The dam is flanked and supported by two \\"wing\\" dams which form the abutments; the one on the left bank is long and the right is . The dam withholds a reservoir with a capacity of of which is live (active or \\"useful\\") storage. The reservoir also has a catchment area of and surface area of . The dam's spillway is located on its crest and contains 10 wide uncontrolled openings with a maximum discharge capacity of . Three other openings exist in the dam's orifice which consist of diameter pipes, two of which can discharge a maximum of each and the third . The dam's crest elevation is above sea level while the reservoir's normal operating level is and low level is considered . The dam's power station, Kurobe No. 4, is located underground and contains four generators which are powered by Pelton turbines for a total installed capacity of 335 MW and average annual generation of 1 billion kWh. The power station is wide, high and long. The penstock serving water to the power station is long and utilizes a maximum effective hydraulic head of while transferring a maximum of to the turbines. The plant's surge chamber is long and high. In popular culture A novel turned film, Kurobe no Taiy≈ç (ÈªíÈÉ®„ÅÆÂ§™ÈôΩ; literally \\"The Sun of Kurobe\\"), starring Yujiro Ishihara (the late brother of Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara), recounts the drama of the project. The P.A.Works's mecha anime television series Kuromukuro is mainly settled in a UN research facility located around the lake, while the NHK television series Project X was also based on the dam's construction. The 1961 kaiju film Mothra, directed by Ishir≈ç Honda, includes an action sequence filmed at the dam before its completion. Mothra's attack causes the dam to break. Kurobe dam was destroyed by Gamera in War of the Monsters (Gamera vs Barugan). Kurobe dam was also seen in Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. Additionally, the final arc of the 2004 Tetsujin 28-go anime, which takes place in a fictionalized 1950s Japan, heavily involves the construction of the Kurobe Dam. Access The Kurobe Dam is the most popular hydropower site in Japan and, between late June and mid- October, water is released from its spillway for onlookers. The surrounding Kurobe Gorge is also popular as well and is accessible by the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. Start from Toyama Station which, from March 2015, is accessible by Hokuriku Shinkansen (trains Kagayaki or its slightly slower counterpart, Hakutaka) from Tokyo, Nagano, Kanazawa, and various other stations along the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line. Take the train from Dentetsu Toyama Station in Toyama to Tateyama Station (Toyama) by Toyama Chih≈ç Railway Tateyama Line (65 minutes). (Note: Toyama Station is the main station with the shinkansen hub, while Dentetsu Toyama is the station next to the main station with local lines that go through the towns of Funahashi, Kamiichi, and Tateyama, to ultimately reach Tateyama Station (Toyama)). From Tateyama Station (Toyama), take the Tateyama Cable Car to Bijodaira Station (7 minutes). From there, the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route bus will take you to the 2450 m high Murod≈ç Station (50 minutes). From Murod≈ç Station, visitors should take the Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus (10 minutes), followed by the Tateyama Ropeway (7 minutes), and finally the Kurobe Cable Car (5 minutes). From the last stop, a 15-minute walk will take visitors to the spectacular dam. The whole trip from Toyama Station takes roughly four hours to complete one-way, and costs around 10,000 yen in transportation fees. Various accommodations are available in Murodo area as well as near Tateyama Station, for those too tired to make the trip back down into Toyama City.

It is the seat-in- exile of the Gyalwang Karmapa, inaugurated in 1966 by the 16th Karmapa. It is also a focal point for the sectarian tensions within the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism that characterize the 17th Karmapa controversy. History Originally built under the direction of Changchub Dorje, 12th Karmapa Lama in the mid-18th centuryAchary Tsultsem Gyatso; Mullard, Saul & Tsewang Paljor (Transl.): A Short Biography of Four Tibetan Lamas and Their Activities in Sikkim, in: Bulletin of Tibetology Nr. 41, 2/2005, p. 57. , Rumtek served as the main seat of the Karma Kagyu lineage in Sikkim for some time. But when Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa, arrived in Sikkim in 1959 after fleeing Tibet, the monastery was in ruins. Despite being offered other sites, the Karmapa decided to rebuild Rumtek. To him, the site possessed many auspicious qualities and was surrounded by the most favorable attributes. For example, flowing streams, mountains behind, a snow range in front, and a river below. With the generosity and help of the Sikkim royal family and the local folks of Sikkim, it was built by the 16th Karmapa as his main seat in exile. After four years, construction of the monastery was completed. The sacred items and relics brought out from Tsurphu Monastery, the Karmapa's seat in Tibet, were installed. On Losar in 1966, the 16th Karmapa officially inaugurated the new seat, called \\"The Dharmachakra Centre, a place of erudition and spiritual accomplishment, the seat of the glorious Karmapa.\\" The monastery is currently the largest in Sikkim. It is home to the community of monks and where they perform the rituals and practices of the Karma Kagyu lineage. A golden stupa contains the relics of the 16th Karmapa. Opposite that building is a college, Karma Shri Nalanda Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies. Rumtek is located from Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim, at an altitude of about . Controversy Rumtek is at the centre of the Karmapa controversy, with a lengthy battle being played out in the Indian courts. Two rival organisations, each supporting a different candidate for the 17th Karmapa, claim stewardship of the monastery and its contents. The two organisations are the Tsurphu Labrang (supporting Ogyen Trinley Dorje) and the Karmapa Charitable Trust (supporting Trinley Thaye Dorje). Since 1992, the monastery has been the site of pitched battles between monks supporting one candidate or the other. Neither candidate resides, nor has been enthroned, at Rumtek. Ogyen Trinley Dorje was enthroned at Tsurphu Monastery. Monks supporting Trinley Thaye Dorje (the minority) were thrown out of Rumtek by Indian security forces in order to quell violence between the two factions. Armed Indian soldiers still patrol the monastery to prevent further sectarian violence.

Location Aligned northeast to southwest, the Great Glen Fault extends further southwest in a straight line through Loch Linnhe and the Firth of Lorne, and then on into northwestern Ireland, directly through Lough Swilly, Donegal Bay and Clew Bay as the Leannan Fault. To the northeast the fault connects to the Walls Boundary Fault and the associated Melby Fault and Nestings Fault, before becoming obscured by the effects of Mesozoic rifting to the north of Shetland. The fault continues on the North American side of the North Atlantic Ocean, but is no longer part of a contiguous fault, as the complete fault was broken when the Mid-Atlantic Ridge formed 200 million years ago. The North American side of the fault runs through the length of northwestern Newfoundland, Canada, as the Cabot Fault (Long Range Fault) and on into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is at least long. History Metamorphic zones, and Moine Thrust Belt, Great Glen Fault and Highland Boundary Fault Euramerica in the Devonian (416 to 359 Ma) with Baltica, Avalonia (Cabot Fault, Newfoundland and Great Glen Fault, Scotland) and Laurentia The Great Glen Fault has a long movement history. It formed towards the end of the Caledonian orogeny associated with the collision between the Laurentia and Baltic tectonic plates at the end of the Silurian continuing into the Early Devonian (likely age range 430‚Äì390 Ma (million years)). The movement at that time was sinistral (left-lateral), the same as the closely related set of faults sub-parallel to the main part of the Great Glen Fault, which include the Strathconon Fault and Strathglass Faults to the northwest and the Laggan Fault, Tyndrum Fault, and Ericht-Laidon Fault to the southeast. The second main phase of movement was during the Carboniferous, this time with a dextral sense. The exact timing is uncertain, but associated folds within the Devonian are cut by members of the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian dyke swarm. The Great Glen Fault had its final phase of movement during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary. The displacement is estimated to be 64 miles (104 km). Erosion along the fault zone during Quaternary glaciation formed the famous Loch Ness. The fault is mostly inactive today, but occasional moderate tremors have been recorded over the past 150 years which has meant that seismic buffers are built into the Kessock Bridge carrying the A9 out of Inverness. Fortunately, none of the modern day infrastructure has been affected by the tremors, as the latest one to affect Inverness and the surrounding area occurred in September 1901 and was approximately a 5.0 magnitude quake.

The village itself has a small population, with a surrounding rural farming community. Most of the population are Welsh speakers. Llanddoged shares its community council with the rural community of Maenan. Llanddoged has two small hamlets attached to it - Groesffordd and Tan-Lan. Groesffordd has a motor repair garage known as 'Garej Groesffordd'. Tan-lan was known for its notorious bends on the A470 where, before road improvements, many road traffic collisions had occurred. Tan-lan is also home to an Environment Agency Wales depot.  Amenities  It has a primary school, Ysgol Llanddoged, and education is delivered through the medium of Welsh. Many of the children at the school are from Llanddoged or Maenan but some also from Llanrwst. The school hall also acts as a community centre. Several organisations such as 'Merched y Wawr' and the Women's Institute also meet here. The village enjoys amazing views on the many paths that circle it and routes for keen walkers are well-used. There is also a small playground park and playing field, known as 'Cae Cetyn'. The parish church is called Eglwys St Doged, after whom the village is named. The church is part of the diocese of St Asaph within the Church in Wales. Services are conducted Bilingually every Sunday from 9:30 to 10:30.  Ras Fawr Llanddoged  Every year the village is host to 'Ras fawr Llanddoged' (Welsh for: Llanddoged's Great Race). The race is run over a vigorous 10 km, mostly uphill, course. Approximately 60 people race each year. The race was started by the late Arfon Jones, Ffrith Galed. More information can be found here: rasfawrllanddoged.co.uk/haneshisory http://rasfawrllanddoged.co.uk/haneshisory  History  Saint Doged's Church, set in a circular churchyard in Llanddoged, was rebuilt in 1839, but was originally a sixth-century martyrium constructed to shelter the grave of Saint Doged. It is Grade II* listed. Nearby, the waters of Saint Doged's Well were reputed to cure eye-disorders. The church is open to visitors and inside still has the original layout, with a large seating box for each wealthy family and seats for their servants behind. Some old house names can still be seen on the doors. The area across the aisle was provided for the villagers to use. The church also has three pews above each other, much like a chapel. The altar is at the front of the church, before the village seating but diagonal to the families with their own seating boxes. An old well can be seen behind the church to which the myths above relate. The church originally had 12 trees planted around it to signify the 12 disciples with Christ in the middle. Unfortunately, now there are only 10 trees standing around the church. A Roman road passes close to Llanddoged, indicated by the nearby place-name: 'Sarn Ddu' shown on the map as the name of the local sewage works. Sarn, which means causeway in Welsh, has been commonly used to name Roman roads such as Sarn Helen, also in Roman Wales. Sarn is also used to indicate defences against water (flood, tide) where these, like Roman roads, involve significant built-up lines of layers of stones. There are also indications of a causeway. A possible route on which this may stand is a NNW- SSE road starting close to the edge of the east bank of Afon Conwy, just SE of the Tan-yr-Allt building in Coed Bortho, facing the confirmed Roman fort at Caerhun, suggesting this road may have been to a Ferry or ford. It may have run SSE via Sarn Ddu towards Nebo, & the A5, but this is still being researched. Another possible route is a WSW-ENE road the route of which may run close to the nearby Caer Faban, another unconfirmed possible Roman site, in which case Llanddoged / Sarn Ddu may stand in the vicinity of Roman crossroads.

The site features a museum dedicated to the life and times of the famous monk, with other features and attractions ‚Äì including a reconstructed Anglo-Saxon farm and the 18th-century Georgian building Jarrow Hall House itself ‚Äì reflected in a calendar of activities, including special themed events, an educational programme for schools and heritage skills workshops, alongside space for businesses and events. History The Anglo-Saxon attraction Bede's World opened on an 11-acre site in Jarrow in 1993 at a cost of almost ¬£10m, and was run by the Bede's World Charitable Trust, with grant support from the local council. Although the complex attracted 70,000 visitors a year, it became no longer financially viable and ceased operation in February 2016. The writer and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg was critical of its closure, and in an item on BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House in 2016, he contrasted the museum's plight to the funding made available to the Garden Bridge Project in London. Reopening and relaunch It was announced in August 2016 that the former Bede's World site would re-open as 'Jarrow Hall Anglo-Saxon Farm, Village and Bede Museum', to be managed by the charity Groundwork's South Tyneside and Newcastle trust. Following over ¬£100,000 of investment by Groundwork and a soft-open in October 2016, the site fully launched on 8 April 2017, hosting activities for all ages including farm talks, live re-enactment combat, authentic Anglo Saxon craft and lectures, as well as the reconstructed historical dwellings being renovated by authentically-attired workers using traditional wattle and daub building techniques. The interior of Jarrow Hall House was also renovated with Georgian-era expertise provided by Durham University, and hosts a new coffee shop, Hive Coffee Company. The direction and development of the site is now led by Leigh Venus, former Venue Manager of Newcastle upon Tyne's historic Tyneside Cinema. Current features The Bede Museum building features an \\"Age of Bede\\" exhibit, which includes excavated artefacts from the historic monastery such as stained glass, imported pottery, coins and stone carvings, and exhibits about Anglo-Saxon culture, Bede's life and works, the life of a monk, and the medieval Kingdom of Northumbria. There is a working reconstructed Anglo-Saxon farm called Gyrwe (pronounced \\"Yeerweh\\") after the Old English name for Jarrow, showing animal husbandry with full-size reconstructions of three timber buildings from Northumbria based on the evidence of archaeological work. Thirlings Hall was the largest, with animal hide and other objects. A wood-burning fire in the form of a small pit/designated area is used throughout the year, and allows for a great smell to filter through the building. The two other buildings, smaller in size, are a grubenhaus ‚Äì a sunken building used as a cold store ‚Äì and a monk's cell. All buildings are thatched and were built using traditional techniques. The farm animals are of similar breeds to animals that would have been present circa 1300 years ago, to simulate the types of animals which would have been seen in Anglo-Saxon England; cattle are smaller and sheep more varied, before selective breeding methods were introduced.

He was the founder of a new religious movement known as Adidam. He changed his name numerous times throughout his life; these names included Bubba Free John, Da Free John, Da Love-Ananda, Da Kalki, Da Avadhoota and Da Avabhasa, among others. From 1991 until his death, he was known as Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj or Adi Da. Adi Da initially became known in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. His philosophy was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared that he was a uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else. Adi Da wrote many books about his spiritual philosophy and related matters, founding a publishing house to print them. He gained praise from authorities in spirituality and philosophy, but was also criticized for what were perceived as his isolation, \\"Jones has made his self-protective seclusion a defining mark of his teaching career.\\" controversial behavior, claims toward exclusive realization, and cult-like community. In the mid-1980s, allegations by former followers of false imprisonment, brainwashing, sexual abuse, assault and involuntary servitude received international media attention. These allegations resulted in lawsuits or threatened suits on both sides Biography =Youth (1939‚Äì70)= Adi Da as an infant, 1940Adi Da was born Franklin Albert Jones on November 3, 1939, in Queens, New York and raised on Long Island.Lowe, Ed, \\"The House Where Swami Lived\\"Long Island Newsday Magazine, September 14, 1986 His father was a salesman and his mother a housewife. A sister, Joanne, was born when he was eight years old. He served as an acolyte in the Lutheran church during his adolescence and aspired to be a minister, though after leaving for college in the autumn of 1957 he expressed doubts about the religion to his Lutheran pastor. He graduated in 1961 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Columbia University and went on to complete a master's degree in English literature at Stanford University in 1963.Gallagher... \\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, p.86-88Feuerstein, Georg, \\"Holy Madness,\\" 1st ed., Arkana, 1992, p. 80 After graduating from Columbia, Adi Da began using a variety of hallucinogenic and other drugs,Jones, Franklin \\"The Knee of Listening: The Life and Understanding of Franklin Jones\\" (1971), chapter 4 \\"He had some raw peyote, and we decided to take the drug, although neither of us had any idea what its effects would be.

With fellow former Scientology employee Sal Lucania as financier, Adi Da opened Ashram Books (later Dawn Horse Books), a spirituality bookshop in Los Angeles.

They disagreed on a series of questions Adi Da had prepared.

Subsequent names included Da Love-Ananda, Dau Loloma, Da Kalki, Hridaya-Samartha Sat-Guru Da, Santosha Da, Da Avadhoota, Da Avabhasa, and from 1994, Adi Da Love-Ananda Samraj, or Adi Da.

Adi Da and his organization were sued by Beverly O'Mahoney, then wife of the Adidam president, for fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, and assault and battery (among other things); the suit sought $5 million in damages. To a local reporter, Adidam threatened to file its own lawsuit against O'Mahoney, as well as five others who had been named in stories and interviews making allegations of abuse (no suit was ever filed). Adidam charged that allegations against the church were part of an extortion plot.Molly Colin, \\"Da Free John Sect Sues 6 Ex-Members On Extortion Charge, The Mill Valley Record, April 17, 1985. The church issued conflicting statements in response to the coverage. A lawyer for the church said that controversial sexual activities had only occurred during the \\"Garbage and Goddess\\" period years earlier. Shortly after, an official church spokesman said that \\"tantra-style encounters\\" of the kind described in allegations were still occurring, but were mostly confined to an inner circle.Feuerstein, \\"Holy Madness,\\" Arkana, 1992, p.90 \\"sexual [experiments] were for the most part confined to an inner circle.

Lenz's followers were widely admired for their success in business and computing and represented an attractive potential \\"catch.\\" From all reports, Jones pulled out all the stops, giving immediate satsang to Lenz's followers and inviting some directly into his inner circle, deeply offending his own long-suffering devotees. Jones also proclaimed that Lenz...had been a reincarnation of Swami Rama Tirtha...a former disciple.\\"Feuerstein, Holy Madness (2006), p.176 \\"Also in the year 2000, Adi da welcomed into his church the remaining community of Fredrick P Lenz III\\" Later, Adi Da began to exhibit his digital art and photography.

Adi Da had four children: three biological daughters with three different women, and one adopted daughter.Feuerstein, 2006, p. 169 These include actress Shawnee Free Jones. Philosophy Fundamental to Adi Da's religious philosophy is the essentially \\"eastern\\" religious concept that the purpose of human life is spiritual enlightenment, an awakening to ultimate reality that is the natural state of all human beings (though seemingly obscured.)Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Volume V, p.88 =\\"Self-contraction\\"= Adi Da said that what keeps human beings from experiencing this ultimate, enlightened reality is the activity of ego, which he stated is the source of all emotional, psychological, and spiritual dissatisfaction. He called this activity \\"self-contraction,\\" and defined it as a psychological mechanism lying somewhere beneath the normal level of conscious awareness, leading people to believe they are limited, suffering individuals. He said that fundamentally, all efforts to unite with the divine from the point of view of a separate self were futile, since that separate self itself is illusory.Gallagher, Eugene, Ashcraft, Michael. (2006). Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, Volume V, p.97-98 =\\"Seventh stage realization\\"= Adi Da developed a map of potential human and spiritual evolution that he called \\"the seven stages of life\\".Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America [Five Volumes] By Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft, Greenwood Press, , 2006, page 99 *First Stage‚Äî\\"individuation/physical development\\" *Second Stage‚Äî\\"socialization\\" *Third Stage‚Äî\\"integration/mental development\\" *Fourth Stage‚Äî\\"spiritualization/Divine Communion\\" *Fifth Stage‚Äî\\"spiritual ascent\\" *Sixth Stage‚Äî\\"abiding in consciousness\\" *Seventh Stage‚Äî\\"Divine Enlightenment: awakening from all egoic limitations\\" The first six stages account for all permutations of religion and culture throughout history, as well as levels of personal development. Adi Da categorized the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of life as the highest respective stages of human development. He characterized those who have reached these stages as \\"saints\\", \\"yogis\\", and \\"sages\\", including other religious figures such as Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ.Samraj, Adi Da (2004). The Knee of Listening. \\"I (Alone) Am The Adidam Revelation\\". pgs. 502‚Äì504. Dawn Horse Press. Relative to this spectrum, Adi Da stated that while some \\"yogis, saints, and sages\\" had occasionally indicated some awareness of a \\"seventh stage\\", only he as a unique avatar had ever been born fully invested with the capability to fully embody it; furthermore, as the first \\"Seventh Stage Adept\\" only he would ever need to (or be capable of) doing so.Samraj (2005b) p. 93 He stated that the seventh stage has nothing to do with development and does not come after the sixth stage in a sequential manner. The culminating awareness of this seventh stage is a permanent, natural state of \\"open-eyed ecstasy\\", for which Adi Da employed the Sanskrit term Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi.Gallagher...New Religions, p.100 \\"...despite this state being well attested in yogic literature (for instance among the ascetic Bauls of Bengal), Adi Da portrayed it as his own exclusive state.\\" Adi Da insisted that since he solely embodied seventh stage realization, devotional worship of him would henceforth be the exclusive means for others to free themselves from \\"self-contraction\\", thereby allowing them to \\"participate in his enlightened state\\" (i.e. attain awareness themselves of the seventh stage, or \\"realize\\" it.)Samraj, Adi Da, Eleutherios, Dawn Horse Press, 2006, p. 456; \\"I Am the First (and the Only One) to Realize and to Demonstrate seventh stage Realization, which (now, and forever hereafter) I Alone, and Uniquely, Reveal and Transmit to all my formally practicing true devotees and thus potentially to all beings.\\"Feuerstein, Georg. (2006) Holy Madness, p. 167 \\"it was sufficient for disciples to simply meditate upon him to \\"participate in his enlightened state\\"Gallagher/Ashcraft, Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, p. 99George D. Chryssides, The A to Z of New Religious Movements, Rowan Litterfield Publishing Group, 2001, p. 47 Adidam Dome Temple at Da Love-Ananda Mahal in Kauai, Hawaii Temple at Adi Da Samrajashram in Naitaba, Fiji Adidam refers to both the organization of Adi Da's devotees and the religion he taught. The organization, or church, founded initially in 1972, went by many earlier names, including the Dawn Horse Communion, the Free Communion Church, the Laughing Man Institute, the Crazy Wisdom Fellowship, the Way of Divine Ignorance, and the Johannine Daist Communion.Reilly, Gary; \\"How Franklin Jones Became the Master\\", The Mill Valley Record/April 3, 1985 Adidam presupposes an eastern view of divinity and accepts the concepts of karma, reincarnation, chakras, etc. It also employs many Sanskrit terms and concepts. God, or the divine, is seen as a principle and energy, a consciousness that predates creation but is not a willful creator itself.Gallagher... \\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, p.98-99 Though earlier manifestations were more eclectic and experimental, over time Adidam increasingly came to resemble the Hindu tradition of bhakti yoga.Gallagher, The New Religious Movements Experience in America, p.98-99Feuerstein 1992, p. 98 The practice of Adidam is now defined by its emphasis on a devotional relationship to Adi Da, whom followers see as an enlightened source of power serving as the sole gateway to the divine.Gallagher... \\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, p.93 Adi Da's followers often refer to him simply as \\"Beloved\\". Through devotion and service, it is believed that the follower's consciousness is gradually transformed in the image of Adi Da's. While devotion to Adi Da and the study of his teachings are the primary features of Adidam, other specified practices are also prescribed, including the study of other religious texts, physical exercises, regulation of sexuality, and a raw vegan diet.\\"America 2004, Page 118\\" Adi Da said that after his death there would not be any further teachings or \\"revelations\\", and that his message was complete.Gallagher... \\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, p.97 His artwork, writings, and the religious hermitages and sanctuaries \\"empowered\\" by his presence are to remain as expressions of his teaching and being. He was emphatic that no individual assert themselves as his representative or heir.Samraj, Adi Da, \\"The Orders of My True and Free Renunciate Devotees\\", Dawn Horse Press, 2007, pg.110 \\"all those who truly devotionally recognize Avatar Adi Da serve as \\"instruments\\" of His Blessing- Regard in the world.\\"Gallagher, The New Religious Movements Experience in America, p.97 While the church is based on Naitaba Island, Fiji, there are five officially designated ashrams, or \\"sanctuaries\\", belonging to Adidam. Three are located in North America, with another in Hawaii. Followers of Adidam have been ambitious and prolific in their dissemination of Adi Da's books and teachings; however, the church is estimated to have remained more or less constant at approximately 1,000 members worldwide since 1974, with a high rate of turnover among membership.Gallagher... \\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, pp.86, 105Feuerstein 1992, p. 93 \\"[He] has a flair for drama and it has been successful in keeping the attention of [some] for years...but it evidently is not a way that holds an attraction for larger numbers of spiritually motivated people.\\" Works thumb|left|250 px|Orpheus and Eurydice (diptych), 2008 Eurydice One: The Illusory Fall of the Bicycle into The Sub-Atomic Parallel Worlds of Primary Color and Point of View Part Three: The Abstract Narrative in Geome and Linnead (Second Stage) ‚Äì L 4 (from Linnead One) 2007, 2009 ‚Äì Lacquer on aluminum, 96 x 198 x 5 inches. =Books= Adi Da wrote prolifically about his spiritual philosophy, creating the Dawn Horse Press in 1973 to publish his books.

These works were primarily photographic and digitally produced. He labeled his style \\"Transcendental Realism.\\" In 2007 Adi Da's works were included in an exhibition collateral to the Venice Biennale in Italy curated by Italian art historian Achille Bonito Oliva; the exhibit then moved to Florence. The Spectra Suites, a book of Adi Da's art, has an introduction by American art historian and critic Donald Kuspit....Welcome Books, 2007, pp 1‚Äì11 Reception =Critique= Ken Wilber From 1980 to 1990, philosophical theorist and author Ken Wilber wrote a number of enthusiastic endorsements and forewords for Adi Da's books, including The Dawn Horse Testament, The Divine Emergence of the World-Teacher, and Scientific Proof of the Existence of God Will Soon Be Announced by the White House!Wilber, Ken (1985) Review of Adi Da's The Dawn Horse Testament ‚Äì www.adidawilber.com Wilber also recommended Adi Da as a spiritual teacher to those interested in his own writings. Later, Wilber alternated between praise and pointed criticism.The Case of Adi Da Ken Wilber Online. October 11, 1996.Ken Wilber, Ken (1997) \\"Private\\" letter to the Adidam community ‚Äì www.adidawilber.com In his last public statement concerning Adi Da he wrote: \\"I affirm all of the extremes of my statements about Da: he is one of the greatest spiritual Realizers of all time, in my opinion, and yet other aspects of his personality lag far behind those extraordinary heights. By all means look to him for utterly profound revelations, unequaled in many ways; yet step into his community at your own risk.\\"An Update on the Case of Adi Da Ken Wilber Online. August 28, 1998. Others In 1982, yoga and religion scholar Georg Feuerstein formally became a follower of Adi Da, and wrote a number of introductions to Adi Da books. He later renounced this affiliation, becoming publicly critical of Adi Da and the community surrounding him in Fiji. Feuerstein devoted a chapter to Adi Da in his 1991 book Holy Madness: Spirituality, Crazy-Wise Teachers, and Enlightenment.Feuerstein, \\"Holy Madness,\\" Arkana, 1992, chapter 4 In the introduction to the 2006 edition, Feuerstein describes having edited the sections devoted to Adi Da to reflect these changes in opinion.Feuerstein (2006), intro., chapter 4. Asian religions scholar Scott Lowe was an early follower of Adi Da and lived in the community in 1974. In an essay later analyzing what he had witnessed as well as Adi Da's subsequent career, he perceives a pattern of \\"abusive, manipulative, and self- centered\\" behavior, saying \\"does it necessarily follow that the individual who is 'liberated' is free to indulge in what appear to be egocentric, hurtful, and damaging actions in the name of spiritual freedom? I personally think not, while acknowledging the subtlety and complexity of the ongoing debate\\".\\"Lowe, Scott and Lane, David. (1996) DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones. Mt. San Antonio College Philosophy Group. Lowe and others have also criticized Adi Da's claims toward the exclusivity of his realization. In part, critics point to his earlier message strongly rejecting the necessity for any religious authority or belief, due to \\"enlightenment\\" being every individual's natural condition.Gallagher...\\"Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America,\\" Vol IV, pp.98‚Äì99Lowe, Scott and Lane, David. (1996) \\"DA: The Strange Case of Franklin Jones\\". Mt.

He also mentions Adi Da in his books Spiritual Nutrition and Tachyon Energy. Psychiatrist Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross wrote an endorsement for Adi Da's book Easy Death, referring to it as a \\"masterpiece\\".

It originally aired on March 20, 1964 on CBS. In this episode, set on Mardi Gras, a dying man coerces his relatives into wearing grotesque masks that reflect their true personalities. Plot On the night of Mardi Gras, a wealthy old man named Jason Foster is attended by his physician, Dr. Sam Thorne, who warns him that his death is imminent. Cranky and candid, Jason is not cheered by the arrival of his daughter Emily Harper and her family: husband Wilfred, son Wilfred Jr., and daughter Paula. All four have terrible traits: Emily is a cowardly hypochondriac who whines about her perceived ailments; Wilfred, a successful businessman, is greedy, thinking of everything in monetary terms; Paula is vain, constantly checking her appearance in the mirror; and Wilfred Jr. is an oafish, sadistic bully who enjoys causing pain and suffering. Jason is not shy about his opinions and openly insults each of them. He says he has a special Mardi Gras party planned for the group that night. After dinner, the family gathers in Jason's study where he instructs them to put on special one-of-a-kind masks, which he says are \\"crafted by an old Cajun\\". Explaining that an old Mardi Gras custom involves wearing a mask that is the opposite of one's true personality, Jason sarcastically gives one to each person: a sniveling coward for Emily, a miserable miser to Wilfred, a twisted buffoon to Wilfred Jr., and a self-obsessed narcissist to Paula. He dons a skull mask, saying that it represents death as opposed to his life. The others refuse to participate at first, but Jason rightfully accuses them of only being there to claim his fortune upon his death. He informs them that his will is drawn up so that they inherit everything, but only if they wear their masks until midnight. They reluctantly concede and put on their masks. As the hours tick by, all four beg to be allowed to take off the masks, saying that they are unbearable. Their pleas are wasted on Jason, who delivers a final tirade to his family as the clock strikes midnight. \\"Without your masks, you're caricatures!\\" he says as he dies. The four rejoice in their newly inherited wealth and unmask, but discover to their horror that their faces now conform to the hideous features of the masks. Jason's face, on the other hand, proves to be superficially unchanged. Dr. Thorne observes, \\"This must be death. No horror, no fear, nothing but peace.\\" Cast *Robert Keith as Jason Foster *Milton Selzer as Wilfred Harper *Virginia Gregg as Emily Harper *Brooke Hayward as Paula Harper *Alan Sues as Wilfred Harper Jr. *Willis Bouchey as Dr. Samuel Thorne *Bill Walker as Jeffrey The Butler *Maidie Norman as Maid *Rod Serling as Host / Narrator ‚Äì Himself Episode notes \\"The Masks\\" was directed by Ida Lupino, who had starred in the first-season episode \\"The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine\\".

He was the trainer of the sprinters Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou. The three were at the center of a huge doping scandal at the start of the 2004 Summer Olympics. The athletes were suspended by the IAAF in December 2004 but have been free to compete since December, 2006. Tsekos is serving a 4-year suspension handed down by the Greek athletics federation in 2005. Tsekos, a former nutritional supplements salesman who lives alternatingly in his native Greece and his adopted home in Lincolnwood, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago), had been involved in a number of doping-related incidents before. In 1997, at an athletics event in Dortmund, Germany, a row occurred between Tsekos and an IAAF doping controller whom he prevented from testing four of his athletes, among them Thanou and Charis Papadias. However, the doping controller, Klaus Wengoborski, arrived with no identification and without a female official accompanying him, a violation of IAAF regulations at the time. The Greek federation nevertheless suspended Tzekos but no action was taken against the athletes. The IAAF agreed with the Greek federation's ruling. The Greek national health authority fined Tsekos 14.800 euros for illegally importing anabolic substances. In 2004 a raid on his office uncovered 1400 ampoules containing anabolic and other prohibited substances. Some sources say that these were just supplements without the appropriate legal papers for import in Greece. According to To Vima, a respected Greek daily newspaper, Tsekos had proposed a secret program to the Greek government in 1997, which was projected at a cost of 6 million euros and was intended to provide 150 Greek athletes with non-detectable doping substances in preparation for the 2004 Olympic Games. The government declined the offer. Tzekos had also stated on Greek TV channel Antenna that he has great admiration for the GDR sports program. In 2003, it was reported that U.S. authorities found e-mails by Victor Conte addressed to Tzekos while searching BALCO (Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative), the California company secretly dealing Tetrahydrogestrinone, an anabolic steroid specially designed so as to make it undetectable under normal drug testing. In addition, according to the respected French paper \\"L'Equipe,\\" Tzekos was directly dealing with the creator of norbolethone and THG (tetrahydrogestrinone) Patrick Arnold, the father of pro-hormone craze and some undetectable designer steroids. However in September 2007, Greek prosecutors ruled there was no evidence supporting any connection between Tzekos and BALCO, after examining evidence sent from the district attorney of northern California. Tzekos has also continued to insist that he only knew Arnold as a supplier of nutritional supplements, and has denied receiving illegal substances from him.

Combining sections of National Cycle Route 7, 14, 71 and 72; it runs from Whitehaven or Workington on the west coast of Cumbria, and then crosses the Lake District and the Pennines in the north of England by using a variety of both on and off-road trails, ending on the north-east coast in Tyne and Wear at Sunderland or Tynemouth. Sustrans state that it is the UK's most popular challenge cycle route, it is designed for the whole range of cyclists, from families to cycling club riders. Although a challenge with some hard climbsthe highest point being over the C2C is completed by an average of between 12,800 and 15,000 cyclists every year.  History  The C2C is part of the UK National Cycle Network (NCN), and was developed by Sustrans in partnership with various local authorities, Groundwork West Cumbria, North Pennines Tourism Partnership, Forest Enterprise and the Lake District National Park amongst others. The route was opened in 1994 running from Whitehaven on the west coast of Cumbria to the north-east coast at Sunderland. A northern branch splits off from the main route at Consett, following the route of the Derwent Walk, passing through Tyneside and ending at Tynemouth. In 2005 a complementary route was opened further to the south. This, titled the Walney to Wear route (W2W), is designed to be slightly tougher and longer. It runs from Walney Island in south-west Cumbria to Sunderland via the North York Moors and Durham.  Art  Roadside sculpture A number of public artworks have been commissioned for the route, including Tony Cragg's Terris Novalis at Consett, sheepfolds by Andy Goldsworthy at various points in Cumbria and Alison Wilding's Ambit in the River Wear at Sunderland. Eduardo Chillida had been commissioned to create a work for Whitehaven, but the project has not been completed. On the Consett to Sunderland line, there are The Old Transformers by David Kemp below Pontop Pike mast near Annfield Plain and four steel cows by Sally Matthews near Beamish Museum.  Route  The route has two alternative start points in West Cumbria at Whitehaven and at Workington, before travelling through the stunning scenery of the western and northern Lake District. The Workington route runs via Cockermouth to Keswick, while the Whitehaven route runs via Loweswater to Keswick before passing through Penrith and the Eden Valley with its lush valleys and sandstone villages. It then starts the climb up to Hartside Pass and onto the Northern Pennines--the \\"roof of England\\". There then follows an undulating ride as the C2C meanders through old lead-mining villages, such as Garrigill, Nenthead and Rookhope, and down into the Durham Dales before crossing Waskerley Moor and entering the old steel town of Consett via the Hownes Gill Viaduct. From Consett it's an easy ride via Leadgate, Annfield Plain, Stanley, Beamish and through one of Britain's old industrial heartlands to the North Sea and Sunderland. There is also the option of starting at Workington and/or finishing at Tynemouth and also a link route at Penrith to join up with the Glasgow to Carlisle section of the National Cycle Route. The route is made up of approximately: *main roads--mainly short sections through urban areas--4% *minor roads--quiet, country roads--50% *cyclepaths/off-road--disused railway lines, etc.--46% The C2C is best ridden from west to east to take advantage of the prevailing winds from the west and the more favourable gradients. Tradition dictates that you start the ride by dipping your back wheel in the Irish Sea and only ends when your front wheel gets a dip in the North Sea at the finish. The floods of December 2015 destroyed or damaged some bridges on the C2C route through Cumbria, and there is quite often forestry work which closes some off-road sections, but alternative routes are signposted and are generally shown on the C2C-cycle website. It is typically completed in 3‚Äì5 days, though it has been completed in a single day (the record is currently held by Joel Toombs and Matt Shorrock at 7 hours 53 minutes and 03 seconds west to east on 28 September 2012. The youngest person to complete the C2C in one day is Christian Webster-Reed, aged 15, who completed the C2C in a moving time of 8:56:04 and an overall time of 13:56:24 on 25 August 2013. The route links to other parts of the NCN so can be used as part of a longer cycle tour. Route maps for the C2C and detailed route guides from other publishers are available from Sustrans.

Top speed is 200 km/h. The train set can be composed of up to 10 coaches and provides close to 1,000 seats, according to SBB. In 1997-2004, the consortium, made up of Schindler Waggon, Pratteln (later Bombardier Transportation Switzerland) and Alstom delivered 341 coaches to SBB, of which about 320 coaches are still in use as of December 2009. Overview A Starbucks caf√© coach in November 2013 IC 2000 was the first double-deck train in use on a nationwide scale. Previously, most, if not all, double-deck trains, belonged to the Z√ºrich S-Bahn network. The IC 2000 typically has a dining or a bistro car, and a snacks trolley service on the upper level throughout the train set. Both the first and second class coaches feature luggage racks on both decks; in addition, small suitcases can be stored under the seats. In November 2013, the first Starbucks caf√© coaches on SBB-CFF-FFS were launched using two refurbished IC 2000 dining cars, used on a 9-month trial basis on the St. Gallen ‚Äì Geneva route.https://www.railwaygazette.com/sbb-launches-starbucks- coffee-coach/38882.article The driving trailer at the beginning or at the end of the train is either a family coach with a special play area on the upper level or has a family zone, also on the upper level. In either case, there is space on the lower deck of the driving trailer for pushchairs, bicycles, and skis. Trains with family coaches are marked FA in the timetables. 75 first class coaches are equipped with power sockets for charging laptops etc. Trains with such business zones are marked BZ in the timetables and the coaches themselves can be identified by a laptop icon. On certain routes, passengers are able to use mobile broadband internet access for an additional fee. The business zone coaches can be typically found behind the locomotive. The usage of the IC 2000 is now very commonplace in Switzerland. Its \\"cowlike\\" black- and-white design, and red doors, make it instantly recognisable. The train exterior was designed by Pininfarina, to match the style of the Re 460 locomotive used with the trainset. Due to the frequent use of mobile phones, in December 2008, SBB introduced \\"quiet zones\\" in both classes, where \\"conversation and discussion, even if conducted quietly; listening to music or the radio, even using headphones; using audio and video applications on laptops; and using mobile phones\\" are prohibited. However, after one year quiet zones have been restricted to some first class coaches only.  IC 2020 Project  A refurbished IC 2020 driving car, spotted at Brig station In December 2016, Swiss Federal Railways initiated the largest refurbishment project up-to-date. Entire fleet of IC 2000s (total 341 cars) will be refurbished by the end of 2024. Refurbished IC 2000 coaches are expected to operate until 2043, combined with refurbished Re 460 locomotives, that are being reassembled in SBB's Yverdon-les-Bains facility. After the renovation IC 2000 coaches will be rebranded as IC 2020. Exterior has different look compared to current fleet (somewhat resembling the 3rd generation Stadler KISS); coaches are pure white, accompanied by black band located under ground floor which is extending to undercarriage. A red stripe that has the same color as SBB logo is following the entire set, then covering the front section of the driving car. Refurbished coaches have also different interior compared to IC 2000 fleet. In contrast to dark tones that current coaches have, refurbished interior have mainly lighter tones and materials. 40 first class coach will receive conference tables for business meetings which will replace standard 4/2 person compartments. Renovated coaches are put to service for further testing on operational routes. These coaches are prototypes and usually mixed with IC 2000 coaches. The refurbishment is taking place in SBB Olten facility.https://news.sbb.ch/artikel/86661/fernverkehr-die-ersten- ic2000-fahrzeuge-sind-komplett-modernisiert  Operated Routes  Service run by IC 2000 (as of 2020): *St. Gallen - Winterthur - Zurich Airport - Zurich HB - Bern - Fribourg - Lausanne - Geneva - Geneva Airport; *Romanshorn - Amriswil - Frauenfeld - Winterthur - Zurich HB - Bern - Thun - Spiez - Visp - Brig; *Basel - Olten - Bern - Spiez - Interlaken/Brig; *Lucerne (- Rotkreuz) - Zug (- Baar) - Thalwil - Zurich HB (- Zurich Airport - Winterthur - Frauenfeld - Konstanz (D)) (operated as an InterRegio, without Bistro/Restaurant coach); *Lucerne - Zofingen - Bern - Fribourg - Romont - Lausanne - Geneva - Geneva Airport (operated as an InterRegio, without Bistro/Restaurant coach); *Lucerne - Zofingen - Olten - Sissach - Liestal - Basel (operated as an InterRegio, without Bistro/Restaurant coach); *Brig - Visp - Sion - Martigny - Montreux - Lausanne - Geneva Airport (operated on IR90 route as InterRegio, without Bistro/Restaurant coach); References External links  Bombardier Transportation AG - IC 2000 Double-deck train - bombardier-transportation.ch Railway coaches of Switzerland Double-decker rail vehicles ","title":"IC 2000"},{"id":"987774","text":":There are other meanings for Amaya. 250px|right|thumbImage of the Pe√±a del Castillo in Pe√±a Amaya.

Amaya was one of the main villages of the Cantabri Celtic tribes, and played a key role in the Cantabrian wars during the Roman conquest of Hispania, and later, during the Visigothic Kingdom, as the capital of the Duchy of Cantabria. Amaya is mentioned in the Chronicle of John of Biclaro, as a town captured by the Visigothic king Liuvigild in 574.John of Biclaro, Chronicle, 32; translated in Kenneth Baxter Wolf, Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain, second edition (Liverpool: University Press, 1990), p. 64 According to the Muslim chroniclers, in the year 714, Musa ibn Nusair sacked Amaya for the second time after Tariq did the year before. Peter, the provincial dux, led his people into refuge in the mountains, and after the local noble Pelayo of Asturias in the neighbor region of Asturias started a rebellion against the Berber garrison, Dux Peter as other western Galician nobles supported the election of him as new King or Princeps in the lead against the common enemy. In the first stages of the Reconquista, the city was part of the repopulating efforts of the Kingdom of Asturias in the border region of Bardulia, the primitive territories of Castile. After the campaigns of Alfonso I of Asturias (739-757) against the Moors, the city lay an abandoned in the largely empty buffer zone between Moors and Christians known at the time as \\"The Desert of the Duero\\" and was part of the repopulation campaign carried out a century later, during the reign of Ordo√±o I of Asturias (850-866). At that time it was an important and significant place, as a very old saying states: \\"Harto era Castilla peque√±o rinc√≥n, cuando Amaya era la cabeza y Fitero el moj√≥n\\" (A very small corner was Castile, when Amaya was the head and Fitero the boundary stone).

It is intended to help treat and prevent chapped lips, hence the name. Many varieties also include sunscreen in order to prevent sunburn. Due to its popularity, the term has become a genericized trademark. It popularly refers to any lip balm contained in a lipstick-style tube and applied in the same manner as lipstick. However, the term is still a registered trademark, with rights exclusively owned by GlaxoSmithKline. Its main competitors in the US, Carmex and Blistex, also use the popular lipstick-style tube for their lip balm products. In Iceland and in the United Kingdom, the product's main competitor is Lypsyl, made by Novartis Consumer Health and distributed in similar packaging to ChapStick.  History  ChapStick Classic Original lip balm In the early 1880s, Charles Browne Fleet, a physician and pharmacological thinker from Lynchburg, Virginia, invented ChapStick as a lip balm product. The handmade product, which resembled a wickless candle wrapped in tin foil, was sold locally, and did not have much success. In 1912, John Morton, also a Lynchburg resident, bought the rights to the product for five dollars. In their kitchen, Mrs. Morton melted the pink ChapStick mixture, cooled it, and cut it into sticks. Their lucrative sales were used to found the Morton Manufacturing Corporation. In 1935, Frank Wright, Jr., a commercial artist from Lynchburg, Virginia, was commissioned to design the CHET ChapStick logo that is still in use today. He was paid a one- off fee of $15. In 1963, The A.H. Robins Company acquired ChapStick from Morton Manufacturing Corporation. At that time, only ChapStick Lip Balm regular stick was being marketed to consumers; subsequently, many more varieties have been introduced. This includes ChapStick four flavored sticks in 1971, ChapStick Sunblock 15 in 1981, ChapStick Petroleum Jelly Plus in 1985, and ChapStick Medicated in 1992. Robins was purchased by American Home Products (AHP) in 1988. AHP later changed its name to Wyeth. ChapStick was a Wyeth product until 2009, when Wyeth was acquired by Pfizer. Pfizer sold the manufacturing facility in Richmond, Virginia, on October 3, 2011, to Fareva Richmond, who now manufactures and packages ChapStick for Pfizer. In 2019, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare acquired ChapStick from Pfizer.  Composition  Ingredients commonly include camphor, beeswax, menthol, petrolatum, phenol, vitamin E, aloe and oxybenzone. However, there are many variants of ChapStick, each with its own composition. The full list of ingredients in a regular-flavored ChapStick is: arachidyl propionate, camphor, carnauba wax, cetyl alcohol, D&C; red no. 6 barium lake, FD&C; yellow no. 5 aluminum lake, fragrance, isopropyl lanolate, isopropyl myristate, lanolin, light mineral oil, methylparaben, octyldodecanol, oleyl alcohol, paraffin, phenyl trimethicone, propylparaben, titanium dioxide, white wax, propanol. Its net weight is usually . When manufactured by Wyeth, Chapstick contained no parabens. Uses ChapStick functions as both a sunscreen, available with SPFs as high as 50, and a skin lubricant to help prevent and protect chafed, chapped, sunburned, cracked, and windburned lips. \\"Medicated\\" varieties also contain analgesics to relieve sore lips.  Marketing  265x265pxChapStick is sometimes available in special flavors developed in connection with marketing partners such as Disney (as in cross-promotions with Winnie the Pooh or the movie Cars) or with charitable causes such as breast cancer awareness, in which 30¬¢ is donated for each stick sold (as in the Susan G. Komen Pink Pack). The Flava-Craze line is marketed to preteens and young teens, with colorful applicators and \\"fun\\" flavors such as Grape Craze and Blue Crazeberry. US Olympic skier Suzy Chaffee starred in ChapStick television commercials in which she dubbed herself \\"Suzy ChapStick\\". Another very famous ChapStick advertisement includes basketball legend Julius Erving (commonly known as Dr. J) naming himself Dr. ChapStick and telling young children about the great things that ChapStick can do. Diana Golden, a U.S. Olympic Gold medal winning skier and the 1988 Ski Racing Magazine and United States Olympic Committee female skier of the year, was also a spokesperson for ChapStick. Former ski racer Picabo Street, for a time, was seen on television commercials as one of the company's endorsers.

Cultura y pol√≠tica en Navarra (1870-1960). Mainly Chapter 3. Thesis by I√±aki Iriarte L√≥pez, 11 December 1998. Includes a summary and analysis of some aspects of the novel. The story is placed during the invasion of Visigothic Spain by the Moors. Plot summary Mixing history and legend, it presents a situation in which pagan and Christianized Basques unite under the first king of Navarre and ally with Pelayo, the first king of Asturias to defend Catholic Iberia against the invading Muslims. Amaya is a Christian noblewoman, daughter of a Basque woman and Ranimiro, the ruthless Visigoth general. She is a niece to pagan leader Amagoya, who prefers her other pagan niece as heiress to the secrets of Aitor, the Basque ancestral patriarch. Pacomio is a Jew conspiring in disguise among Muslims, Visigoths and Basques. Eudes, duke of Cantabria, is Pacomio's son, but, by hiding his Jewish origin, has reached a high post in the Visigoth kingdom and aspires to power beyond what his allies and his father would allow. At the end, the secret of Aitor is revealed, to recommend Christianity; the pagan Basques (except for Amagoya) convert and Amaya marries the Basque resistance leader, Garc√≠a, becoming the first monarchs of Navarre. The legends of Teodosio de Go√±i and San Miguel de Aralar, the Caba Rum√≠a, the Table of Solomon in Toledo, and others are also mentioned in the plot.

Shows the river course highlighted on a topographic map. The river flows from Algonquin Provincial Park to the Ottawa River east and north of the town of Renfrew. The river's name is thought to come from the French \\"bonne ch√®re\\" meaning \\"good cheer\\". Course The Bonnechere River begins in Algonquin Provincial Park at McKaskill Lake in geographic Clancy Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District. It heads north into geographic Niven Township, then loops back southeast into Clancy Township, under a Hydro One transmission corridor and into geographic Guthrie Township. It continues southeast through the Crooked Chute, over the High Falls, through the Stacks Rapids to the unincorporated place Basin Depot, located on a former logging road. The river continues southeast out of the park at Boundary access point (Access point Q), enters geographic Burns Township in Madawaska Valley, Renfrew County, then heads into geographic Richards Township in Killaloe, Hagarty and Richards, Renfrew County, takes in the left tributary Pine River, passes through the Jack Chute Rapids, and reaches Round Lake, where it takes in the right tributary Sherwood River. The rivers leaves the lake at Grassy Bay controlled by the Round Lake Dam and reaches Golden Lake in North Algona Wilberforce, where it is crossed by Ontario Highway 60. The lake is home to Killaloe at the west and the Algonquins of Pikw√†kanag√†n First Nation at the southeast. From Golden Lake until the river reaches Admaston/Bromley downstream, the river forms the boundary between North Algona Wilberforce (left bank, on the north) and Bonnechere Valley (right bank, on the south). The Bonnechere River leaves Golden Lake controlled by the Golden Lake Dam. The river reaches its mouth at Lac des Chats on the Ottawa River near the settlement of Fergusons Beach. The river is long and drains an area of . Economy During the 19th century, the river was used to transport white pine logs from the forested areas surrounding the river. A number of hydroelectric plants have been built on the river. Natural history The Bonnech√®re Caves, formed from ancient limestone, are located by the river near the village of Eganville, Ontario, in the hamlet of Fourth Chute, Ontario.http://bonnecherecaves.com/ The First Chute (waterfall) of the river is where the Bonnechere empties into the Ottawa River, at Castleford. The Second Chute is in Renfrew; this waterfall has a small hydroelectric dam. The Third Chute is in Douglas, Ontario; it also has a small hydroelectric dam. The Fourth Chute is in the small village Fourth Chute, and the Fifth Chute is in Eganville, Ontario. There are two provincial parks along its length: the Bonnechere River Provincial Park (a 23 km long section bordering Algonquin Park) and the Bonnechere Provincial Park (located on Round Lake). The Bonnechere River lies mostly in a 175 million year old rift valley called the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben. Over the years, songs have been written about the Bonnechere River including the recent \\"In The Arms Of The Bonnechere River\\" by Ottawa Valley singer/songwriter, Terry McLeish.  River run  Each year the river is host to a raft run between the third and fourth chute. Originally arranged by local Shriners the run has taken on a less official status, occurring with little to no organization apart from its pre-determined date during Victoria Day weekend. Participants design and build a raft or anything else they hope will take them down the river. The river presents natural obstacles in the form of light rapids. There is no competitive angle to the run with no prize at the end other than warmth and a good time. Most participants are young adults from the area returning to visit friends and family. Having recently surpassed its twenty-fourth year, the river run is a local tradition.

Mostly they are trains that run \\"from region to region\\", as best described by Swiss Federal Railways. Belgium In Belgium, InterRegio (IR) trains were slower than the fast IC trains, and usually called at more stations along a route. Their journey was usually not as long as IC trains, but still traveled further than the local (L) trains. Most IR trains had hourly frequencies, some having only services every two hours (although this is mostly true only for weekend services). All trains in Belgium shared the same cost structure, so taking an IR train cost the same as an IC or L train for the same route. The only difference lay in the number of station stops they called at. In December 2014 the InterRegio was withdrawn, InterRegio lines were either converted to InterCity or local train or cancelled completely. Switzerland The InterRegio in Switzerland was first introduced in 1997. They replaced some of the former fast trains with their own identity (InterRegio). InterRegio trains are now very commonplace in Switzerland. The abbreviation is IR in a 45¬∞-edgy font, white letters on red. The ICN runs as an InterCity train but sometimes with halt frequencies in the same manner as an IR (Geneva/Lausanne-St. Gallen/Basel route) and sometimes as IC trains (Basel-Chiasso). When ICN services first began on May 28, 2000, the ICN was placed as an InterRegio train. Germany InterRegio trains were also commonplace in Germany from 1988 to 2003. They travelled and mainly connected regions in Germany. Most of the InterRegio lines have been replaced by InterCity lines; a few were replaced by the newly established Interregio- Express (IRE) type. However, Interregio-Express lines belong technically to the short distance train category, and tend to be shorter. InterRegio trains were very popular as they could be used without supplement - DB scrapped them, hoping customers would trade up to InterCity (IC) or Intercity Express (ICE) trains, a policy that was only partially successful, and then only when the SparPreis brand of tickets were introduced. Denmark The InterRegio system was also introduced to the Danish railways in the early 1990s and became an alternative to the InterCity services, with no seat reservation required. However, unlike other countries, InterRegio trains in Denmark only operates on Fridays and Sundays, to support the heavy flow of passengers that travel on those days. These InterRegio services also have fewer stops than the InterCity services, which goes against the original InterRegio concept of long-distance trains with more local stops. There are no specific rules for the composition for these trains, and both old and new material has been used for InterRegio services. Poland EU43 (Bombardier TRAXX) locomotive with a Bydgoszcz- Warsaw InterRegio train In Poland, interREGIO trains were introduced by Przewozy Regionalne (PR) in spring of 2009, the first IR train connecting Bia≈Çystok with Warsaw.

In the beginning these trains operated mostly on Fridays and Sundays along the routes: Wroc≈Çaw-Krak√≥w, Krak√≥w-Przemy≈õl, Pozna≈Ñ-Olsztyn, Pozna≈Ñ-Warsaw and Bydgoszcz-Warsaw. Since June 2009 there are more interREGIO trains on routes; most of them are available through the whole week, some of them only on weekends.

He was known simply as Beyers Naud√©, or more colloquially, Oom Bey (Afrikaans for \\"Uncle Bey\\"). Early life and education One of eight children, Beyers Naud√© was born to Jozua Fran√ßois Naud√© and Adriana Johanna Naud√© (n√©e) van Huyssteen in Roodepoort, Transvaal (now Gauteng). The progenitor of the Naud√© name was a French Huguenot refugee named Jacques Naud√© who arrived in the Cape in 1718.. The Naud√© surname is one of numerous French surnames that retained their original spelling in South Africa. Beyers Naud√© was named for General Christiaan Frederick Beyers, under whom his father had served as a soldier and unofficial pastor during the second Anglo-Boer War.\\"Beyers Naud√©.\\" African National Congress. Jozua Naud√©, an Afrikaner cleric, \\"was convinced that the British would never leave.\\" He helped to found the Broederbond (Afrikaans, \\"Brotherhood\\" or \\"League of Brothers\\"), the powerful Afrikaner men's secret society that played a dominant role in apartheid South Africa. The Broederbond became especially synonymous with the Afrikaner-dominated National Party that won power in 1948 and implemented the racial segregation policy of apartheid. The elder Naud√© also helped produce the earliest translations of the Bible into Afrikaans. In 1921, the Naud√© family moved to the Cape Province town of Graaff-Reinet, in the Karoo region. Beyers Naud√© attended Afrikaans Ho√´rskool [Afrikaans High School], matriculating in 1931. Naud√© studied theology at the University of Stellenbosch and lived at Wilgenhof men's residence. He graduated in 1939 with an MA in languages and a theology degree. His sociology lecturer was the future prime minister and chief-architect of apartheid, H.F. Verwoerd. But Naud√© credited Stellenbosch theologian Ben Keet with laying the groundwork for his own theological dissent. Naud√© was ordained in 1939 as a minister in the South African Dutch Reformed Church and joined the Broederbond as its youngest member. For 20 years he served various congregations,\\"Beyers Naud√©.\\" Encarta. starting at Wellington in Western Cape Province (1940-1942), Loxton (1942-1945), Pretoria - South-Olifantsfontein (1945-1949), Pretoria East (1945-1954), Potchefstroom (1954-1959) and Aasvo√´lkop (Johannesburg) (1959-1963) preaching a religious justification for apartheid. On 3 August 1940 Naud√© married Ilse Weder, whose father had been a Moravian missionary. The couple had three sons and a daughter.  Anti-apartheid activities  The Sharpeville massacre in 1960 (during which the South African police killed 69 black demonstrators protesting against restrictions on their freedom of movement) ended his support for his church's political teachings. He began to question the biblical justification of apartheid by the Dutch Reformed Church: \\"I made an intensive study of the Bible to prove that those justifications were not valid. I concluded that the passages that were being used by the white DRC to justify apartheid were unfounded. In some cases, there was a deliberate distortion in order to prove the unprovable!\\" In the three decades after his resignation from the denomination, Naud√©'s vocal support for racial reconciliation and equal rights led to upheavals in the Dutch Reformed Church. =Cottesloe and the Christian Institute of Southern Africa= In response to Sharpeville, the World Council of Churches (WCC) sent a delegation to Johannesburg to meet with clerics. Naud√©, by then the moderator of his church district (the Southern Transvaal Synod), helped to organize a consultation (the Cottesloe Consultation) between the WCC and eighty South African church delegates in Cottesloe, a Johannesburg suburb. The Cottesloe Consultation's resolutions rejected race as the basis of exclusion from churches, and affirmed the right of all people to own land and have a say in how they are governed. Naud√© alone among his church's delegates steadfastly continued to reject any theological basis for apartheid after Prime Minister Verwoerd forced the DRC delegation to repudiate the consultation. The Dutch Reformed Church later left the World Council of Churches. In 1963 Naud√© founded the Christian Institute of Southern Africa (CI), an ecumenical organization with the aim of fostering reconciliation through interracial dialogue, research, and publications. The DRC forced Naud√© to choose between his status as minister and directorship of the CI. He then resigned his church post, left his Aasvo√´lkop congregation in Northcliff, Johannesburg, and resigned from the Broederbond in 1963. As a result, he lost his status as minister in the Dutch Reformed Church. His last sermon to his congregation noted that \\"We must show greater loyalty to God than to man\\". Stoically anticipating the enormous pressure by the Afrikaner political and church establishment that was to come, he told his wife: \\"We must prepare for ten years in the wilderness.\\" Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu later said \\"Beyers became a leper in the Afrikaner community.\\" During the same year Naud√© was blamed for leaking secret, confidential and unauthorized documents about the Broederbond to the press. The University of the Witwatersrand New Testament scholar Professor Albert S. Geyser later admitted that he had leaked the documents. Naud√© had given the documents to Geyser to evaluate the extent of the influence of the Broederbond on the church.Geyser then provided the information to a journalist at The Sunday Times. The book \\" The Super-Afrikaners. Inside the Afrikaner Broederbond \\" written by Ivor Wilkins and Hans Strydom published in 1978 exposed a name list of possible members of the Broederbond. The source of these documents, that was taken without authorization, was blamed on Naud√©. In 1967 Naud√© and Geyser won a libel case against conservative Pretoria Professor Adriaan Pont, who had called them communists. In 1970 Naud√© was among few white South African Christian leaders \\"who openly called for understanding of the WCC decision\\" to provide financial support for liberation movements in southern Africa.\\"Letter to Rev. Dr Molefe Tsele, General Secretary of the South African Council of Churches, 7 September 2004.\\" Georges Lemopoulos. World Council of Churches \\"If blood runs in the streets of South Africa it will not be because the World Council of Churches has done something but because the churches of South Africa have done nothing,\\" Naud√© said. In response, the state formed the Schlebusch Commission in 1972 to investigate anti-apartheid Christian organizations. When Naud√© refused to testify, he was tried and imprisoned. After a night in the cells, a DRC minister paid his fine. During a 1972 trip to Germany and Britain, Naud√© preached at Westminster Abbey, \\"the first Afrikaans theologian to be so honoured\\". In 1973 the state withdrew his passport, but temporarily returned it in 1974 so that he could travel to the University of Notre Dame, Chicago, to receive the Reinhold Niebuhr Award for justice and peace. As the CI increasingly incorporated black African radicals like Steve Biko, Naud√© had to bear the brunt of harassment by the state security police. The state eventually forced the CI to close in 1977. = Banning and the SACC = From 1977 to 1984 the South African government \\"banned\\" Naud√© -- a form of house arrest with severe restrictions on his movements and interactions. For example, he could not be in the same room with more than one other person. Other leaders of the Christian Institute suffered the same fate, including Brian Brown, Cedric Mayson, and Peter Randall. Although under constant police surveillance, Naud√© managed to secretly help anti-apartheid resistors move around and out of South Africa by providing them with old vehicles that he had repaired himself. He later joked that this was \\"My small contribution to a struggle I knew was right.\\" His ANC liaison was Sydney Mufamadi, who became Minister of Provincial and Local Government in the post-apartheid government. In 1980 Naud√© and three other DRC theologians broke with the DRC and were accepted as clergy by the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa, the black African denomination established by the white Dutch Reformed Church. After his unbanning in 1985, he succeeded Archbishop Desmond Tutu as secretary general of the South African Council of Churches. In this role he called for the release of political prisoners (especially Nelson Mandela) and negotiation with the African National Congress. In 1987 the apartheid regime outlawed public pleas for the release of detainees. But Naud√© pressed Christians to continue to publicly pray for detainees, despite government threats of imprisonment. After his term at the South African Council of Churches ended, Naud√© continued to serve a number of anti-apartheid and development organizations, including the Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa, the Ecumenical Service for Socio-Economic Transformation, Kagiso Trust, and the Editorial Board of Challenge Magazine.  Post-apartheid influence  After 1990 Naud√© occasionally opened ANC events with scripture readings. That same year he was invited by the African National Congress to be the only Afrikaner member on their delegation in negotiations with the National Party government at Groote Schuur. Despite his long association with the African National Congress, Naud√© never actually joined the party. Some have speculated that this, along with his advanced age and constant ill health during the last few years of his life, caused him to be politically sidelined. Others conclude that Naud√© harbored a fierce independence and never sought personal advancement. Despite his association with the ANC, for instance, he also maintained ties with the black consciousness movement and the Pan Africanist Congress. In 2000 he signed the Declaration of Commitment by White South Africans, a public document that acknowledged that apartheid had damaged black South Africans. After his death at 89 on 7 September 2004, Nelson Mandela eulogized Naud√© as \\"a true humanitarian and a true son of Africa.\\" Naud√©'s official state funeral on Saturday 18 September 2004 was attended by President Thabo Mbeki, other dignitaries, and high-ranking ANC officials. Naud√©'s ashes were scattered in the township of Alexandra, just outside Johannesburg. He was survived by his wife, four children, and two great-grandchildren. Despite being persecuted by his own ethnic group, Naud√© \\"never outwardly expressed spite for his former opponents. 'I am an Afrikaner,' he said. 'I saw myself never as anything else but an Afrikaner, and I'm very grateful for the small contribution which I could have made.'\\" Honors and accolades During his life Naud√© received several honors, including the Bruno Kreisky Award (Germany, 1979), the Franklin D Roosevelt Four Freedoms Award (USA, 1984), the African American Institute Award (USA, 1985), Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award (USA, 1985) along with Allan Boesak and Winnie Mandela, the Swedish Labour Movement Award (Sweden, 1988), the Order of Oranje-Nassau (Netherlands, 1995), Order for Meritorious Service (Gold) (South Africa, 1997), and the Order of Merit (Germany, 1999). Naud√© received fourteen honorary doctorates during his lifetime and in 1993 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the American Friends Service Committee.AFSC's Past Nobel Nominations Legacy In 2001 the city of Johannesburg, where he had lived most of his life in the suburb of Greenside, honored Naud√© in several ways. Naud√© received the Freedom of the City of Johannesburg while DF Malan Drive, a major road in Johannesburg, was renamed Beyers Naud√© Drive. The Library Gardens in downtown Johannesburg, formerly known as Market Square, were renamed as Beyers Naud√© Square.Beyers Naude Square goes natural , joburg.org.za, retrieved 20 September 2014 In 2004 Naud√© was voted 36th among Top 100 Great South Africans in an informal poll conducted by a television program of the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Naud√© was called \\"one of the true Christian prophets of our time\\" by the acting secretary of the World Council of Churches, Georges Lemopoulos. Naud√©'s comments after the 1976 Soweto uprising presciently anticipated an outflow of South Africans in the post-apartheid era. He warned that white privilege could not and should not endure. \\"For many it will be impossible to live in this new South African society; they will be destroyed physically, emotionally and psychologically. They would be allowed to stay, but they would find the atmosphere unacceptable and therefore many will say, \\"we cannot adjust, we must go.\\"\\" The University of the Free State changed the name of one of its hostels (JBM Hertzog) to Beyers Naud√©.Housing and Residence Affairs - Beyers Naud√© , University of the Free State In Leeuwarden, The Netherlands, the local christian gymnasium (a middle school comparable to a grammar school) was renamed in honour of Beyers Naud√©. https://www.cgbn.nl/Over-de-school/Identiteit  See also  * Christian Institute of Southern Africa * List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid * Pro Veritate * Ravan Press References External links *Beyers Naude -- Christian and Afrikaner Opposition to Apartheid * Cry of Reason: An Afrikaner Speaks Out Video, 1987, 58 mins * Picture * Beyers Naud√© Centre for Public Theology at Stellenbosch University 1915 births 2004 deaths 20th-century Calvinist and Reformed theologians Afrikaner people Calvinist and Reformed anti-apartheid activists Officers Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany People from Roodepoort South African Calvinist and Reformed theologians South African clergy Stellenbosch University alumni Afrikaner anti-apartheid activists Burials at Westpark Cemetery Recipients of the Four Freedoms Award Robert F.

Traditionally, the bearskin was the headgear of grenadiers and remains in use by grenadier and guards regiments in various armies. Bearskins should not be confused with other forms of headdress, including the busby, and other types of smaller fur headdresses. History Imperial Guard, c. 1808. Use of the headgear by the French dates back to the mid-18th century. The cloth caps worn by the original grenadiers in European armies during the seventeenth century were frequently trimmed with fur. The practice fell into disuse until the second half of the eighteenth century when grenadiers in the British, Spanish and French armies began wearing high fur hats with cloth tops and, sometimes, ornamental front plates. Imitating their Prussian counterparts, French grenadiers are described as wearing bearskins as early as 1761.Mouillard, Lucien: Les R√©giments sous Louis XV, Paris 1882 The purpose appears to have been to add to the apparent height and impressive appearance of these troops both on the parade ground and the battlefield.Military Uniforms of the World: Preben Kannil SBN 71370482 9 During the nineteenth century, the expense of bearskin caps and difficulty of maintaining them in good condition on active service led to this form of headdress becoming generally limited to guardsmen, bands or other units having a ceremonial role. The British Foot Guards and Royal Scots Greys did however wear bearskins in battle during the Crimean War and on peacetime manoeuvres until the introduction of khaki service dress in 1902.British Military Uniforms From Contemporary Pictures: W.Y.Carman Hamlyn Publishing Group 1968 Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I in 1914, bearskins were still worn by guard, ceremonial palace or other units in the British, Belgian, Danish, Dutch, Imperial German, Russian and Swedish armies.\\"Uniforms of the World\\": Richard Knotel, . The Italian Sardinian Grenadiers had discarded bearskins in the nineteenth century but were to readopt them for limited ceremonial wear in modern times. Bearskins by country =Australia= Presently, the Pipes and Drums Band of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment is authorized to wear a bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial dress.http://www.rar.org.au/documents/3RARHistoryCom =Belgium= The ceremonial uniform of the Belgian Royal Escort includes a bearskin cap. Two units in Belgium presently use the bearskin cap, the Belgian Royal Escort (since 1938), of the Belgian Federal Police;World Uniforms in Colour volume 1‚ÄîThe European Nations: Rinaldo D'Ami and the Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn ‚Äì Grenadiers of the Belgian Armed Forces Land Component. Until 1914, bearskins were worn in parade uniform by the \\"R√©giment des Grenadiers\\" of the Belgian Army.Pages 24-25 \\"Les Soldats de Leopold Ist et Leopold II\\": Guy Derie/John Pacco. Published Paul Legrain Bruxelles. Bearskins were used in peacetime maneuvers until around 1900, the bearskins were left in barracks upon mobilization in August 1914 and German troops occupying Brussels reportedly took many as souvenirs. The Regiment of Grenadiers' modern successor, the Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn ‚Äì Grenadiers has readopted this headdress for limited ceremonial purposes. In addition to military units, the bearskin cap is also used by the Belgian Royal Escorts, a civilian police unit. Accompanying the monarch of ceremonial occasions, the duties of the escort unit were previously held by the Gendarmerie, a paramilitary unit of the Belgian Armed Forces that was disbanded in 1992. The present Royal Escort Unit wears the pre‚Äì1914 full dress uniform of the defunct Gendarmerie, including its bearskin cap. =Canada= The bearskin caps used by the Canadian Armed Forces are of black fur, and include a coloured plume on the side of the bearskin, and a gold-coloured chin strap. Fusilier regiments and the Royal 22e R√©giment (R22eR) also place their unit's cap badge at the front of the bearskin. The Canadian Forces Dress Instructions presently authorizes the use of bearskins for all of its Foot Guards and fusilier regiments. Bearskins used by the Canadian Army are coloured black and include a coloured plume. In addition to Foot Guards and fusiliers, two line infantry regiments are also authorized to wear a bearskin cap along with their ceremonial full dress uniform, the R22eR, and the Royal Regiment of Canada (RRegtC). Usage of the bearskin cap by the R22eR is attributed to its historical regimental alliance the British Army's Royal Welsh Fusiliers, while the use of bearskins with the RRegtC is attributed to the regiment's historical lineage to the Royal Grenadiers, a Canadian Militia regiment. The following is a list of regiments whose members are authorized to wear a bearskin cap with their full dress uniform, along with the colour used on the unit's plume: * The Royal 22e R√©giment, scarlet plumeUniform of the Royal 22e R√©giment photo * The Governor General's Foot Guards, scarlet plumeGGFG ‚Äì About * The Canadian Grenadier Guards, white plume * The Royal Regiment of Canada, scarlet over white plume * Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent, white plume * Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, white plume * The Princess Louise Fusiliers, grey plume * Les Fusiliers de Sherbrooke, white plume Additionally, the military band of a unit that is authorized to wear the bearskin cap are also allowed to wear it as a part of their ceremonial uniform. These bands include The Band of The Royal Regiment of Canada, La Musique du Royal 22e R√©giment, and the Governor General's Foot Guards Band. In addition to these units, the drum major of the Royal Highland Fusiliers of Canada Band are also authorized to wear the bearskin. The bearskin caps that are used by the aforementioned Canadian units, should not be confused with the busby, a headdress featured on the full dress uniforms for Canadian Army artillery, and hussar regiments. =Denmark= Royal Life Guards features a bronze cap badge. The Royal Danish Army's Royal Life Guards review order uniform is a type of uniform used for special state occasions, and includes a bearskin with the bronze cap badge. Use of the bearskin in the Danish Army dates back to 1803. =Italy= Two units within the Italian Army's Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade use the bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform, the 1st Granatieri di Sardegna Regiment, and the 8th Cavalry Regiment Lancieri di Montebello. As opposed to real bearskin, the bearskin caps of both regiments uses artificial fur. =Kenya= The bands of the Kenya Defence Forces: the Kenya Army Band, the Kenya Navy Band and the Kenya Air Force Band all use a distinctive white and black monkey bearskin as headgear on parade. They are the only KDF units to use such a headpiece. It is based on a pattern used by the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards of the British Army. The first of these bearskins were distributed in the 1960s after independence.https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/910653 =Netherlands= Presently, one unit of the Royal Netherlands Army uses the bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform, the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment. The bearskin caps used by the Grenadiers' and Rifles Guard Regiment should not be confused with the busby; a smaller fur headdress used by the hussar regiments of the Royal Netherlands Army. =Spain= One company of the 1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment, which during ceremonies is authorized to wear grenadier uniforms of the Charles III period, uses bearskins. =Sri Lanka= Presently the military band of the Sri Lanka Artillery uses the bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform. =Sweden= Presently, the grenadier company of the Swedish Army's Life Guards wears a bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform. The bearskin is made out of nylon as opposed to real bearskin. Usage of the bearskin by the Life Guards originates with its predecessor unit, Svea Life Guards. The unit was eventually merged with the Swedish Life Guard Dragoons in 2000 to form the present Life Guards unit. Usage of the bearskin with the Svea Life Guards dates back to 1823, when Alexander I of Russia presented Charles XIV of Sweden a bearskin cap as a gift to be used by the Svea Life Guards. =Thailand= King's Guard use a pith helmet with a heavy plume, resembling a bearskin cap. A number of units within the King's Guard of the Royal Thai Armed Forces wear a pith helmet with heavy plumes, making it resemble a bearskin cap. The pith helmets are used with the unit's ceremonial uniform, for occasions including the Thai Royal Guards parade held every year in December. The colours of the plumes vary from black to pink and blue, depending on the units of the wearers, similar to the uniform facings in the Commonwealth. The majority of the units entitled to wear these headdresses are from the Army and Air Force, with two Royal Thai Marine Corps battalions also maintaining this privilege. In addition, the Royal Security Command's two guards regiments wear the pith helmet with their full dress. =United Kingdom= Following the Battle of Waterloo and the action in which they gained their name, the Grenadier Guards were permitted to wear the bearskin. In 1831, this practice was extended to the other two Foot Guards units at the time. The practice was later extended to the other Foot Guard units of the Guards Division. Members of the following units are authorized to wear the bearskin cap with their full dress: * Grenadier Guards * Coldstream Guards * Scots Guards * Irish Guards * Welsh Guards * Royal Scots Dragoon Guards * Honourable Artillery Company Along with these units, officers of fusilier regiments are also authorized to wear the bearskin as part of their ceremonial uniform. Additionally the members of the regimental bands for the five regiments of Foot Guards, the Honourable Artillery Company, and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards are also authorized to wear the headdress. The drum major of the band for the Royal Highland Fusiliers is also authorized to wear the bearskin. The bearskin caps for British Foot Guards are coloured black, with most caps made from the fur of a Canadian black bear. The standard bearskin of the British Foot Guards is 18 inches tall, weighs 1.5 pounds and is made from the fur of the Canadian black bear.\\"Britain Will Never Part with Bearskin Hats,\\" Associated Press, 9 January 2008. However, an officer's bearskin is made from the fur of the Canadian brown bear as the female brown bear has thicker, fuller fur, and is dyed black. An entire skin is used for each hat.Rachel Shields, \\"They're Changing Hats at Buckingham Palace To Save the Black Bear,\\" The Independent 31 Aug. 2008. The British Army purchase the hats, which are known as caps, from a British hatmaker which sources its pelts from an international auction. The hatmakers purchase between 50 and 100 black bear skins each year at a cost of about ¬£650 each. If properly maintained, the caps last for decades. The bearskin should not be mistaken for the busby, which is a much smaller fur cap worn by the Royal Horse Artillery and hussar regiments in full dress. Nor should it be confused with the 'sealskin' cap worn by the Royal Fusiliers, a smaller furred cap that is actually made of raccoon skin.A Dictionary of Military Uniform: W.Y.Carman Opposition On 3 August 1888, The New York Times reported that bearskin caps might be phased out because of a shortage of bear skins. The article stated that, at that time, bearskin hats cost ¬£7‚Äì5s each (about 35 contemporary US dollars; ¬£600 in 2007 pounds)http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare and noted \\"it can readily be seen what a price has to be paid for keeping up a custom which is rather old, it is true, but is practically a useless one save for the purpose of military display.\\" In 1997, Minister for Defence Procurement Lord Gilbert said that he wanted to see bearskins phased out as soon as possible due to ethical concerns,Buckingham guards' bearskins face their Waterloo but no replacement was available at that time. In 2005, the Ministry of Defence began a two-year test of artificial fur for the hats. The army has already replaced beaver hats and leopard skins, worn by some of its soldiers, with artificial materials. In March 2005, Labour MP Chris Mullin called for an immediate ban on bearskin hats stating that they \\"have no military significance and involve unnecessary cruelty.\\"Call to ban British royal guards from wearing bearskin hats gains support Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has protested against the continued use of real fur for the guards‚Äô hats, alleging that the animals are killed cruelly. For several years, PETA members have held demonstrations, including one at St Peter's Hill, near St Paul's Cathedral, in 2006. PETA wants the fur hats to be replaced with synthetic materials and claims that the Ministry of Defence has not done enough to find alternatives. In February 2011, Joss Stone appeared in a PETA advert targeting the Ministry of Defence, showing the 23-year-old soul singer holding a teddy bear that covers her naked body and features the slogan \\"Bear Hugs, Not Bear Caps\\".Joss Stone goes nude for a PETA campaign against the use of bear fur for military hats =United States= A drum major of the United States Army Band wearing a bearskin cap. The drum major of most American military bands wear a bearskin cap. Presently one military unit in the United States uses a bearskin cap as a part of their ceremonial uniform, the 2nd Company of the Governor's Foot Guard of the Connecticut State Guard, a state defence force. The unit's bearskin caps feature a shield in front bearing the coat of arms of Connecticut, which is supported by a red and black feather plume on both sides of the shield. The bearskin caps used by the 2nd Company should not be mistaken for the busby worn by the 1st Company of the Governor's Foot Guard of Connecticut. In addition to the Governor's Guard, bearskin caps are also worn by the drum majors of various United States Armed Forces military bands. Bands whose drum majors are authorized to wear the bearskin cap include the United States Air Force Band, the United States Army Band, United States Army Field Band, United States Coast Guard Band, United States Marine Band, the United States Navy Band, bands of the service academies, and a variety of other divisional and fleet bands. In addition to military units, a number of civilian marching bands also adorn their drum majors with these headpieces as opposed to their synthetic counterparts. University marching bands which were established through military means typically follow this style of dress for their drum majors. There are also several secondary school bands that use real bearskin hats. = Uruguay = The Uruguayan Army's Company of Sappers of 1837 uses the bearskin cap as a part of its ceremonial uniform as the protocolar guard of the Uruguayan Supreme Court. =Vatican City= Select members of the Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City formerly wore a bearskins cap with a red plume as part of their ceremonial uniform. The ceremonial uniform for the unit was taken out of use in 1970, after Pope Paul VI demilitarized the gendarmerie, with law enforcement falling under the Central Security Office (later reverting its name to the Corps of Gendarmerie in 2002).

A DC electric current passes from the hub of the wheel, through the wheel into the mercury and out through an electrical contact dipping into the mercury. The Lorentz force of the magnetic field on the moving charges in the wheel causes the wheel to rotate. The presence of serrations on the wheel is unnecessary and the apparatus will work with a round metal disk, usually made of copper. :\\"The points of the wheel, R, dip into mercury contained in a groove hollowed in the stand. A more rapid revolution will be obtained if a small electro-magnet be substituted for a steel magnet, as is shown in the cut. The electro-magnet is fixed to the stand, and included in the circuit with the spur-wheel, so that the current flows through them in succession. Hence the direction of the rotation will not be changed by reversing that of the current; since the polarity of the electromagnet will also be reversed.\\" :(Excerpt taken from the 1842 edition of the Manual of Magnetism, page 94) It is used as a demonstration of electromagnetism in physics education. Because mercury is toxic, brine is sometimes used in place of mercury in modern recreations of the experiment.  How it works  Action of a magnet on current and how rotational motion is produced due to this can be shown by Barlow's wheel experiment. The apparatus consists of a star shaped copper wheel capable of rotating freely in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis. The point of each spoke of the star just dips into a pool of mercury kept in a small groove on the wooden base of the apparatus. The pool of mercury is kept in between the two opposite poles of a strong magnet. The wheel rotates with its plane being perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field and during its rotation only one point of the star dips into the pool of mercury at a time. When the axis of the wheel and the mercury are connected to electric cell, the circuit is completed through the axis of the wheel (when a point dips in the mercury) and the mercury. On passing current through the circuit the wheel will begin to rotate due to the action of the magnet on the current. The direction of rotation of the wheel can be determined by applying Fleming's left hand rule. While rotating and when a spoke of the wheel just leaves the mercury the circuit breaks but due to inertia of motion the wheel continues its motion and brings the next spoke in contact with the mercury thereby restoring the electrical contact. In this way rotation of the wheel continues. On reversing the direction of the current or that of the magnetic field the wheel rotates in the opposite direction. The speed of rotation depends upon the strength of the magnetic field and the strength of the current. Here mechanical energy is obtained from electrical energy.

The tree is broad and has a distinctive amber and wine red colour when the young leaves sprout during spring (August‚ÄìSeptember). It grows in savanna, both open woodland and closed woodland of Southern and Eastern Africa, mostly Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique. The word Msasa is commonly used as a proper name in African place names. The word also means 'rough plant' in Swahili. Other common names: Mundu, Myombo, Mtondo (Tanzania), Muputu (Zambia). The plant is known in the Venda language as mutsiwa, which means 'the one that is left behind'. An outlying population of Brachystegia has recently been discovered in the Soutpansberg mountains of northern South Africa. This tree is a protected species in South Africa. Distribution The Msasa is a tropical tree and grows best in open woodland where there is a sharp distinction between wet and dry seasons. The northern end of its range is near Tabora in Tanzania (about 5¬∞ S) and its southernmost extent is near Quissico on the coast of Mozambique just outside the tropics (about 25¬∞ S). Msasas need a minimum of around 500 mm rain although the amount of rain in the summer growing season is more important than the annual rainfall. It needs a mean annual temperature of around 19 to 20 ¬∞C. It does not thrive under a combination of cold and wet conditions and like many tropical plants it requires a hot dry period before the onset of the growing season. Appearance The tree typically reaches a height of about 16 metres although it is less tall in more drought-prone areas. In central Zambia and eastern Angola, magnificent specimens of about 18‚Äì19 metres are common due to the reliability of heavy rain during the growing season. It favours inland situations at an altitude of around 1000‚Äì1400 metres (due to the sharp difference between day and nighttime temperatures) although it grows down to sea level at its southern extremity. The tree presents a series of changes according to the seasons. It starts to lose its leaves as the cool season begins in late May (somewhat sluggishly) and by early August it is bare or nearly so. In late August as temperatures rise again, the new leaves are produced. These are often bright red in colour, but vary from almost purple to brownish in different individuals. The colour shifts to deep green over a period of 10‚Äì20 days. The insignificant flowers appear after the new leaves and these are followed by the dehiscent pods (about 12‚Äì15 cm in length) in April. As with many legume species the pods split explosively and the flat seeds (about 2 cm across) are flung some distance from the parent tree. Ecology The Msasa is ecologically dominant over large areas of central Africa where sufficient summer rainfall is received. In many parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, it is the dominant woodland tree and its colourful springtime foliage is striking seasonal marker. It can withstand light frost as long as little rain falls during the cool season such as on the Mashonaland plateau, where it is often co-dominant with the similar Mnondo (Julbernardia globiflora). Further north it is less dominant but it reaches its greatest size. The Msasa develops heavy spreading boughs and a shapely crown and mature specimens are valued in parks and gardens. However, it grows very slowly and so is seldom grown in cultivation. Uses The pale brown and heavy wood is not durable and is not useful to make most articles or furniture. However, the Msasa tree is widely used for fuel, both as charcoal and firewood. It is often heavily branched and in parts of southern Tanzania the hard wood is highly sought after. It is also used for beehives, and sometimes for boats and general construction. It is considered to be a rather inferior general purpose timber. In southern Tanzania B. spiciformis has several medicinal applications including using the roots to treat dysentery and stomach problems. It is an important shade tree. The leaves are known to be a good fodder and would likely provide good mulch. The species is not nitrogen-fixing. References *Dale, I.R. & Greenway, P.J.

The Blue Line is a border demarcation between Lebanon and Israel published by the United Nations on 7 June 2000 for the purposes of determining whether Israel had fully withdrawn from Lebanon. By September 2018 Israel completed 11 kilometers of a concrete barrier along its border with Lebanon designed to protect Israeli communities from Hezbollah infiltrations.  Background  On 11 March 1978 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) operatives, led by Dalal Mugrabi, carried out the Coastal Road massacre within Israel which resulted in the deaths of 37 Israelis, including 13 children. In response, Israeli forces invaded southern Lebanon from which the PLO operated regularly during the 1970s. Starting on the night of March 14‚Äì15 and culminating a few days later, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops occupied the entire southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre and its surrounding area. This operation is known in Israel as Operation Litani. On 15 March 1978 the Lebanese government submitted a strong protest to the United Nations Security Council against the Israeli invasion, stating that it had no connection with the Palestinian operation. On 19 March 1978 the Council adopted Resolution 425, in which it called upon Israel to cease immediately its military action and withdraw its forces from all Lebanese territory. It also established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The first UNIFIL troops arrived in the area on 23 March 1978.  Definition  The Israel‚ÄìLebanon border fence, north of Metula. The Blue Line is based on the deployment of the IDF prior to 14 March 1978. It should not be confused with the Green Line, established in 1949, which is the armistice line of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, nor the Green Line in Beirut during the violence of the 1980s. The 1949 line is in turn the same as the 1923 Mandate Line which was the border between French- and British-mandated territory (see: Paulet‚ÄìNewcombe Agreement); Lebanon is a former French mandate and Palestine / Israel a former British mandate. (See League of Nations). The 1949 agreement stated that the border would follow the 1923 line. In 1923, 38 boundary markers were placed along the 49 mile border and a detailed text description was published. The 2000 Blue Line differs in about a half dozen short stretches from the 1949 line, though never by more than 475 meters. Borders are usually negotiated between countries, and between 1950 and 1967 Israeli and Lebanese surveyors managed to complete 25 non-contiguous kilometers and mark (but not sign) another quarter of the international border. On 17 April 2000, when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced that Israel would begin withdrawing its forces from Lebanon, the Lebanese government did not want to take part in marking the border. The UN thus conducted its own survey based on the line discussed in United Nations Security Council Resolution 425. On 25 May 2000 the government of Israel notified the Secretary-General that Israel had redeployed its forces in compliance with Security Council resolutions 425. From 24 May to 7 June 2000, the Special Envoy travelled to Israel and Lebanon to follow up on the implementation of the Secretary-General's May 22 report. The United Nations cartographer and his team, assisted by UNIFIL, worked on the ground to identify a line to be adopted for the practical purposes of confirming the Israeli withdrawal. While it was agreed that this would not be a formal border demarcation, the aim was to identify a line on the ground closely conforming to the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon, based on the best available cartographic and other documentary evidence. On 7 June the completed map showing the withdrawal line was formally transmitted by the Force Commander of UNIFIL to his Lebanese and Israeli counterparts. Notwithstanding their reservations about the line, the Governments of Israel and Lebanon confirmed that identifying this line was solely the responsibility of the United Nations and that they would respect the line as identified. On 8 June UNIFIL teams led by Lebanese Brig. General Imad Anka and Brig. General Amin Htait commenced the work of verifying the Israeli withdrawal behind the line. On 16 June the Secretary-General reported to the Security Council that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 (1978) and met the requirements defined in his report of 22 May 2000; namely, Israel had completed the withdrawal in conformity with the line identified by the United Nations, South Lebanese Army militia had been dismantled, and all detainees held at Al-Khiam prison had been freed. The withdrawal line has been termed the Blue Line in all official UN communications since.

Hollonbeck became a paraplegic at age 14 after being hit by a van while bicycling to swim practice. Only days after the accident, while still in the hospital, he watched a wheelchair race on television where Sharon Hedrick broke the world record in the 800 meters. Having been a competitive runner he immediately became interested in the sport and attended a camp for disabled athletes at the University of Illinois the next summer. While attending Rochelle Township High School in Rochelle, Illinois, he was a member of the school's track and field team. As a sophomore, he was allowed to race in a wheelchair division. As the only wheeler he often raced in mixed heats with runners, the wheeler and runner heats were scored separately. For his last two years of high school, however, the school barred him from competing in mixed heats with runners because of safety issues. Despite the fact that Scot trained every day with the runner in mixed practices, he was deemed \\"unsafe\\" during competition. In 1987 Hollonbeck filed the a lawsuit against the school system. This was the first case in the country concerning the right for disabled students to compete on their school teams. In late 1988, after he had graduated from the school, a federal judge ruled that school officials had violated his civil rights, as provided for in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by not allowing him to argue his case. The judge did not rule on whether high school wheelchair athletes should be able to compete alongside or against their able-bodied peers. Hollonbeck received an athletic scholarship to the University of Illinois and was a member of the school's wheelchair basketball and track and field teams. He later moved to Atlanta, Georgia to work for The Coca-Cola Company in the Worldwide Sports Department. He continues to be a disabled sports policy expert and access advocate.

Life He was born into a Jewish family in Podg√≥rze (near Krak√≥w), then Austria-Hungary, now Poland. Fearful of a Russian invasion in Galicia at the beginning of World War I in 1914, his family moved to Germany, seeking greater security. Bochner was educated at a Berlin gymnasium (secondary school), and then at the University of Berlin. There, he was a student of Erhard Schmidt, writing a dissertation involving what would later be called the Bergman kernel. Shortly after this, he left the academy to help his family during the escalating inflation. After returning to mathematical research, he lectured at the University of Munich from 1924 to 1933. His academic career in Germany ended after the Nazis came to power in 1933, and he left for a position at Princeton University. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1945-48.Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars He was appointed as Henry Burchard Fine Professor in 1959, retiring in 1968. Although he was seventy years old when he retired from Princeton, Bochner was appointed as Edgar Odell Lovett Professor of Mathematics at Rice University and went on to hold this chair until his death in 1982. He became Head of Department at Rice in 1969 and held this position until 1976. He died in Houston, Texas. He was an Orthodox Jew.Bochner biography Mathematical work In 1925 he started work in the area of almost periodic functions, simplifying the approach of Harald Bohr by use of compactness and approximate identity arguments. In 1933 he defined the Bochner integral, as it is now called, for vector-valued functions. Bochner's theorem on Fourier transforms appeared in a 1932 book. His techniques came into their own as Pontryagin duality and then the representation theory of locally compact groups developed in the following years. Subsequently, he worked on multiple Fourier series, posing the question of the Bochner‚ÄìRiesz means. This led to results on how the Fourier transform on Euclidean space behaves under rotations. In differential geometry, Bochner's formula on curvature from 1946 was published. Joint work with Kentaro Yano (1912‚Äì1993) led to the 1953 book Curvature and Betti Numbers. It had consequences, for the Kodaira vanishing theory, representation theory, and spin manifolds. Bochner also worked on several complex variables (the Bochner‚ÄìMartinelli formula and the book Several Complex Variables from 1948 with W. T. Martin).

(2002). The best Australian sports writing, 2002. Melbourne, Vic: Black Inc. p.64. Her myelomeningocele required her to have 21 surgical operations by the time she was ten years old. As a preteen, Sauvage suffered scoliosis,Hutchinson, G. (2002). The best Australian sports writing, 2002. Melbourne, Vic: Black Inc. p.65. and at 14, she had surgery to fix a curvature in her spine, using steel rods. The operation was only partially successful, and as an adult, she still has a curve of roughly 49 degrees. She has not had any subsequent surgery to fix the curve in her spine. Sauvage was born in Perth, Western Australia and grew up in Joondanna, Western Australia, where she attended Hollywood Senior High School before leaving to complete a TAFE course in office and secretarial studies. She underwent 20 operations before the age of 10. Her parents encouraged her to participate in sport from a very young age. She started swimming when she was three years old, with her parents enrolling her in swimming classes to help her build upper body strength.Julie, Robotham. \\"Sauvage savours her Magic moment.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald, 21 February 2011: 5. Sauvage started to compete in wheelchair sport at the age of eight. Before that time, she had attempted to play school sport with her classmates but her disability made it difficult. She took up competitive wheelchair racing when she was 15. Sauvage also tried wheelchair basketball as a youngster. Competitive athletic career Action shot of Sauvage on her way to winning silver in the 800 m T54 wheelchair race at the 2000 Summer Paralympics alt=A racing wheelchair in a glass display case amongst other Paralympic paraphernalia. Sauvage lights the Paralympic flame at the 2000 Summer Paralympics Sauvage shown waving to the crowd whilst on the medal podium at the 2000 Summer Paralympics From the ages of 10 to 13, Sauvage represented Western Australia in the national swim championships. She was forced to retire from swimming when she turned 14, because of surgery. When Sauvage first started competing in wheelchair racing, the chairs all had four wheels and were similar to the chairs that they used off the track. The chairs did not have any form of steering. The front wheels were smaller than the back wheels, and when at high speed, they were prone to wobbling. By 1997, racing wheelchairs had basically finished undergoing massive changes to improve them.Hutchinson, G. (2002). The best Australian sports writing, 2002. Melbourne, Vic: Black Inc. p.67. In 1990, Sauvage competed in her first international competition in Assen, Holland, where she won gold in the 100 m setting a new world record. She also won the 200 m race but was disqualified for moving out of her lane. At the Stoke Mandeville Games in England the same year, Sauvage took gold in the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, and two relays.Sauvage, Louise, and Ian Heads. Louise Sauvage: My Story. Pymble, N.S.W: HarperCollins, 2002. Print. =Paralympic Games= Australian athlete Louise Sauvage races at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games Before the start of the 1992 Summer Paralympics, Sauvage held Australian records for the 100 m, 200 m, 800 m, 1500 m and marathon in women's wheelchair racing events. She was being marketed by the Australian Paralympic Federation as Australia's top female wheelchair road racer. At the Barcelona Paralympic Games, he won gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m and a silver in the 800 m TW4 events and finished sixth in Marathon TW3-4. In recognition of her athletic feats she was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. Sauvage was in danger of not going to the 1992 Paralympics because of funding issues for the Australian Paralympic Federation. The Federation made an emergency appeal for funding from the public in order to cover the cost of transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. The Federation found funding through a variety of small donations that allowed Sauvage and other Australian athletes to compete. At the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games, she won four gold medals - 400 m (T53), 800 m (T53), 1500 m (T52-53) and 1500 m (T52-53) and finished fourth in Marathon (T52-53). She won these while having an injured wrist. She set world records in the 1500 m and 5000 m events during these Games. Sauvage won the 5000 m and the 400 m golds only an hour apart. At her final Paralympics in Sydney, 2000, she won two gold medals - 1500 m and 5000 m T54 events and silver medal in 800 m T54. =IPC Athletics World championships= Savauge competed at three IPC Athletics World Championships. At the 1994 Championships in Berlin, Germany, she won four gold medals in T53 events - 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and Marathon. At the 1998 Championships in Birmingham, England, she won six gold medals in 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m, Marathon - T55 events, 4 √ó 100 m and 4 √ó 400 m (T54-55). At her final Championships in 2002 at Lille, France, she won gold medal in 800 m T54 and silver medals in 1500 m and 5000 m T54. =Road racing= 1993 was Sauvage's first year on the international wheelchair racing circuit, competing in the US and Europe.Louise Sauvage steering WA's Madison de Rozario to Paralympic gold It was also the year that she got her first kneeling wheelchair. The pinnacle being the world-famous Boston Marathon where she recorded her first victory, in the women's wheelchair division, in 1997, breaking the stranglehold of the 'Queen of Boston', US racer Jean Driscoll. Sauvage went on to win a further three Boston titles in 1998, 1999 and 2001. She has won the Los Angeles Marathon, Honolulu Marathon and Berlin Marathon.Lifestyle choices: A positive approach to healthy living ‚Äì self- management, diet, exercise. (2005). Balcatta, W. A: R. I. C. Publications. Sauvage won the prestigious Oz Day 10K Wheelchair Road Race ten times ‚Äì 1993‚Äì1999 and 2001‚Äì2003. =Demonstration events= From 1993 to 2001, Sauvage won every IAAF wheelchair demonstration event at IAAF World Athletics Championships. In that same period, she also won the demonstration events for wheelchair racing in the 800 meter race at the Olympic games. The 800 meter event does not require that athletes stay in their lanes after the first turn. For this reason, athletes like Sauvage are required to wear helmets when racing. In 2000, Sauvage won the Olympic demonstration event and was expected to win the Paralympic gold. She was upset by Canadian Chantal Petitclerc. The Australian delegation appealed the result, claiming the race was not fair because another racer, Ireland's Patrice Dockery, was disqualified for leaving her lane too early. The appeal was rejected, because Dockery was too far behind the front runners to impact the results. Sport academics who research the Paralympic Games consider this protest to be pivotal, because it shows the passion of athletes to win and the extent that sports people will go to claim gold. It also highlighted that the rivalries in the sport were real. Petitclerc said of her rivalry with Sauvage that \\"I dream more about Louise than I do my boyfriend.\\" In 2002, Petitclerc beat Sauvage again at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, where the 800 meter event was a full medal event at the games for the first time. It was only the second time that Sauvage had lost to Petitclerc. Training thumb Sauvagee trained 10 to 14 hours a week when she was actively competing. Her training was very focused, and she attempted to make it fun to help her maintain interest. She often trained six days a week. Her training included boxing, swimming and racing between 25 and 35 km in a single session. Frank Ponta was one of Sauvage's first coaches and Andrew Dawes was her coach after 1996 Paralympics. Coaching career After her retirement from competition, she became involved in coaching young wheelchair athletes, establishing a foundation to help support children with disabilities in 2001. In 2004, Sauvage started coaching other wheelchair athletes. The first athlete that she coached was Angie Ballard. Sauvage's coaching helped Ballard win gold 400 m and silver in the 100 m, 200 m, 800 m and 1500 m at the Summer Down Under Series in 2005. Sauvage has attended several international competitions as a coach. She was an athletics coach with the Australian team 2008 Beijing Games and 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships. She is currently Wheelchair Track & Road Elite Development Coach at the New South Wales Institute of Sport and coaches Madison de Rozario. Retirement As a wheelchair basketball player for the Stacks Goudcamp Bears in the WNWBL in 2013 During her retirement from being an athlete, Sauvage created a consulting company that she works for. In 2010, Sauvage was a speaker at the IPC Women in Sport Summit. She spoke alongside Amy Winters and Jayme Paris. In February 2011, Sauvage participated in the Charter Hall Malabar Magic Ocean Swim. The event was created to raise funds for Rainbow Club. It was Sauvage's first ocean swim. She finished the 1 km race in 25:19. In 2011, as part of the Australian Centre for Paralympic Studies oral history project of the National Library of Australia, Ian Jobling conducted an extensive interview with Sauvage. Disability rights Sauvage and Paul Nunnar lobbied Virgin Blue during 2006 to drop a requirement that people in wheelchairs be accompanied by a carer if they wish to ride on a Virgin Blue aircraft. Previously, both athletes had tried to lobby Qantas to lift a limit of only two electric wheelchairs on domestic flights flying on Boeing 737s. The pair were ineffective because the change would have required a change in law, not in airline policy. Sauvage and Nunnar did receive an invitation to help train Qantas staff and help make staff more aware of the needs of the disabled. Recognition Sauvage was the Australian Paralympian of the Year in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 1998. She was also the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Athlete of the year in 1997 and in 2001 inducted into the AIS 'Best of the Best'.Australian Institute of Sport 'Best of the Best' In 1998, she was a winner of the Australian of the Year Awards in the ABIGGRIUOP National Sports Award category. In 2000, Sauvage was named the Female Athlete of the Year in the Sport Australia Awards. In 2000, she was named the \\"World Sportsperson of the Year with a Disability\\" at the first Laureus Sports Awards held in Monte Carlo. In 1999 and 2000, she was named the International Female Athlete of the Year. She received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, Sauvage lit the cauldron during the opening ceremonies for the games. In 2004, Sauvage carried the Australian flag into the stadium at the 2004 Summer Paralympics.FREYA, GRANT. \\"Louise will lead Paralympic team in opening ceremony ‚Äì Sauvage to fly flag for Australia ‚Äì Paralympics 2004 ‚Äì 2 days to go\\".

Meredith. Following the dissolution of most church operations in the United States, GCG's operations shifted to the United Kingdom and reestablished a presence in North America under new organizational identities.  History and background  Roderick C. Meredith had been a minister in the Worldwide Church of God (WCG) for 40 years. He established GCG in response to a number of major doctrinal shifts in WCG. GCG is one of the many Sabbatarian Churches of God to form after WCG's 1995 schism. Herbert W. Armstrong had founded the WCG as a radio ministry (originally called the Radio Church of God) in 1934. Over the next 50 years, the church developed an international presence through The Plain Truth magazine, The World Tomorrow radio and television programs, and three campuses of Ambassador College in the U.S. and England. The WCG taught certain controversial doctrines, including observance of selected Mosaic laws as outlined in the first five books of the Bible (similar to aspects of Judaism) but held to repentance, baptism and the testimony of Jesus Christ as taught in the New Testament. Armstrong died in 1986 and was succeeded by Joseph W. Tkach.\\"Herbert W. Armstrong goes to his Reward\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 35, April, 1986 Under Tkach, WCG adopted a theology in line with historic and mainstream Christianity. During that period of change, many members left WCG, including many ministers who began their own churches in an effort to remain loyal to Armstrong's teachings. GCG was just one among these Sabbatarian Churches of God. Similar in fashion to Armstrong's approach, Meredith and the GCG established a magazine and television program, both under the name The World Ahead. Governance and new affiliations GCG experienced an upheaval of its own after a dispute between Meredith and the church board over governance issues in 1998.\\"Meredith Downsized\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 71, February, 1999 More information about that upheaval, which resulted in a major split in the CGC, can be understood from \\"An Open Letter From The Council of Elders\\" (dated 4 Dec., 1998). In that letter, (signed by Roderick C. Meredith, Carl McNair, Richard Ames, Dibar Apartian, Charles Bryce and John Ogwyn) it stated that in late Nov. 1998, \\"the Board of Directors made the most far-reaching decisions since the inception of Global. They had meetings which culminated with the firing of Global's founder and Presiding Evangelist, Dr. Roderick C. Meredith.\\" It was a dramatic action which, that letter stated, was taken totally apart from any counsel, or advice, from Global's Council of Elders. \\"In the bylaws of the Church it is stated that the purpose of the Council of Elders is to give advice to the Board and to the Presiding Evangelist and to help guide the overall direction of the Work in all spiritual and administration matters. At the time of these Board meetings there were eleven functioning members of the Council, five of which were also members of the Board. The Council's membership had been reduced by two in the preceding week. This was first due to the Council's previous action on November 11 suspending Dave Pack from the Council and secondly due to the tragic and untimely death of Colin Adair on November 15. Mr. Pack's suspension had come after an all-day hearing ending at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, November 11. The hearing and suspension were triggered by serious charges brought against Mr. Pack by church members in Michigan. Mr. Pack was present in the room for discussion of the charges. Prior to its Wednesday adjournment the Council decided, with ten members concurring and two abstaining, to suspend Mr. Pack. Earlier, eight members of the Council had agreed that an outright expulsion of Mr. Pack from the Council was in order. The only three men present in the room to object to Mr. Pack's expulsion were Raymond McNair, Larry Salyer, and Edwin Pope. They were a very distinct minority in the Council meeting that Wednesday. However, when the Board met following Colin Adair's death these three then constituted a majority of the five member Board. When their Friday meeting began (Nov. 20), a motion was made to remove Carl McNair from the Board (though no charges of misconduct were made against him). Since the motion involved Carl McNair, he couldn't participate in the decision and his expulsion was accomplished by agreement of three out of the four participants (Mr. Meredith strongly dissented from this action). The next decision was to fill Mr. McNair's place by the appointment of Norbert Link, the lawyer. Total control of the Board was now gained by this tiny minority of the Council.

It is the largest inland town and highest community above sea level in the Northland Region. With a population of over 4000 people it is a shopping and service centre for an extensive farming district and is sometimes referred to as \\"the hub of the north\\". Geography The town is situated on a relatively level site surrounded mainly by undulating plains and is nearby many former pƒÅ sites including Nga Huha, Pouerua, Te Rua-hoanga, Ngaungau, Kaiaia, Te Tou o Roro, Taka-poruruku, Tapa-huarau, Nga Puke-pango, Maunga-turoto, and Maunga- kawakawa. On the western edge of town, Kaikohe Hill rises 300 m above sea level, allowing views of the imposing sand dunes on the Hokianga Harbour to the west, farmlands to the east and south toward Mount Hikurangi (625 m). To the north of the Putahi volcanic ridge is Lake Omapere, five km in length, but only two to three metres deep. Around five km to the east is the small village of Ngawha Springs, where hot water springs rise to the surface from the Ngawha geothermal field, and where the Northland Region Corrections Facility is situated. There are several volcanic scoria cones in the area, which are part of the Kaikohe-Bay of Islands volcanic field. Demographics Kaikohe had a population of 4,437 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 582 people (15.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 396 people (9.8%) since the 2006 census.

History and culture =Early history= Originally a MƒÅori village called Opango, Kaikohe is recognised as being the very heart of the culture of the great NgƒÅpuhi iwi. In the early 19th century a rival MƒÅori tribe raided the village and fugitives subsisted among the Kohekohe (a native tree) groves on Tokareireia (Kaikohe Hill). After the incident, the village became known as Kaikohekohe (kai meaning food) but was later shortened to Kaikohe. Battles during the Flagstaff War (also known as 'H≈çne Heke's Rebellion') were fought around Kaikohe: at H≈çne Heke's PƒÅ at Puketutu on the shores of Lake Omapere; followed by a battle at Te Ahuahu; with the warriors of Te Ruki Kawiti fighting the Battle of Ohaeawai. St. Michael's Anglican Church in nearby Ngawha Springs was built on the site of the pƒÅ at which the battle took place. The warrior chief H≈çne Heke settled in Kaikohe after fighting ceased, and died there in 1850. His grand- nephew Hone Heke Ngapua, MP for Northern Maori, also lived in Kaikohe. In April 1911, a monument to him was unveiled on Kaikohe Hill by Sir James Carroll, acting Prime Minister. A park in the town is dedicated to Rawiri Taiwhanga who has a very strong claim to being New Zealand's first commercial dairy farmer. He milked a herd of cows and sold butter in 1834. The Aperahama Church named after Aperahama Te Awa who is buried in the churchyard To the west of the town is the Aperahama Anglican Church, named after Aperahama Te Awa. It was opened in 1885, a year after his death, and he is buried in the churchyard. It is on the site of an earlier church, built in 1837, and the existing memorial gates were erected and dedicated for that earlier church. The building is registered as a place \\".... of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value....\\" by Heritage New Zealand. Also in the town is a Pioneer Village, a 19th-century Northland community recreated with all its colourful atmosphere, history and detail. =Railway links= Kaikohe was linked to the national rail network with the arrival of a branch line railway being built from Otiria on the North Auckland Line to Kaitaia, which opened to Kaikohe on 1 May 1914. The line continued north to ≈åkaihau, opening on 29 October 1923 and eventually reached Rangiahua, although the section between Okaihau and Rangiahua was never handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department for operation and the line never reached Kaitaia. The line between Okaihau and Rangiahua was operated for a short time by the Public Works Department before being closed and dismantled during World War II. The railway through Kaikohe thus became known as the Okaihau Branch. Although Kaikohe became the service centre of the Far North, it failed to generate much rail traffic in the early years of the line. During the first ten months of existence, just 1,500 tons of inbound freight was carried, with roughly half that carried outbound, and the decline continued to the point where in 1918 Kaikohe lost its stationmaster. Minimal services were offered, and although losses increased up to 1930, fortunes had somewhat improved by 1940, and by 1950 there was sufficient traffic to justify six trains each way a week. Two carried only freight, while four were mixed goods/passenger trains. At that time, a full complement of staff was again employed at Kaikohe. When railcars were introduced on services north of Auckland in November 1956, they ran through Kaikohe all the way to Okaihau. Previously, a carriage train known as the Northland Express had run from Auckland to Opua with connections to Kaikohe and Okaihau via the mixed trains, but with the change of the northern terminus to Okaihau, the branch increased in importance. This proved to be short-lived; in July 1967 the very popular railcar service was withdrawn due to mechanical problems plaguing the railcars. Passengers had to use the mixed trains, with significantly older rolling stock on a slower schedule. Demand decreased and the branch closed to passengers on 21 June 1976. In 1977, a relaxation of road transport laws led to a decline in freight traffic on the line and forestry proposals that would have required a railway service failed to eventuate. Scheduled trains were cancelled beyond Kaikohe on 12 August 1983, and for a little over four years the line was shunted when required. The branch closed on 1 November 1987 and the track has been lifted. The rail corridor through Kaikohe is still owned by the New Zealand Railways Corporation, being retained in case any forestry proposals come to fruition and the railway is again required, although it now forms part of the Twin Coast Cycle Trail. =Marae= The Kaikohe area has three NgƒÅpuhi marae: * Te Kiore Marae and Te Kiore meeting house are affiliated with NgƒÅti Whakaminenga. * Te Iringa or Parihaka Marae and its Parihaka meeting house are affiliated with NgƒÅti Hinemutu and NgƒÅti Tautahi. * ≈åkorihi Marae is affiliated with NgƒÅti Hinemutu, NgƒÅti Tautahi and NgƒÅti Ueoneone; its meeting house burned down in 2003. Attractions Kaikohe is the geographical centre of the Far North. Within a 50 km radius are the famous Bay of Islands and the Waipoua, Puketi and Omahuta kauri forests. Also not far away are the Whangaroa and Hokianga harbours, the Waiomio limestone caves, many beautiful beaches and secluded bays, and historic Kerikeri which is Northland's largest town. It is also the home of the Kaikohe Demolition Derby which featured in the \\"Kaikohe Demolition\\" movie filmed by Florian Habicht. The Twin Coast Cycle Trail, part of the New Zealand Cycle Trail project, runs through the town. Notable residents Former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange lived in Kaikohe for a time.

Mid 4th century BC Memnon of Rhodes (Greek: ŒúŒ≠ŒºŒΩœâŒΩ ·ΩÅ ·ø¨œåŒ¥ŒπŒøœÇ; c. 380 - 333 BC) was a prominent Rhodian Greek commander in the service of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Related to the Persian aristocracy by the marriage of his sister to the satrap Artabazus II, together with his brother Mentor he served the Persian king for most of his life, and played an important role during the invasion of Alexander the Great and the decades before that. Carl Otis Schuster notes that though often inaccurately described as \\"simply a mercenary\\", Memnon was arguably the toughest defender of the Persian Empire Alexander had to face, and was nearly successful in putting a halt to him. Biography =Under the governor of Phrygia= Not much is known about Memnon's early life. Born in c. 380 BC in Rhodes, Memnon would serve the Persian Empire for most of his life. He started his career in 358 by serving together with his brother Mentor under the Persian satrap (governor) Artabazos II of Phrygia. During his service to the Persian satrap, Artabazos allowed Memnon to marry his daughter Barsine. In about 358 BC, Artabazos staged a rebellion against the then ruling Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404‚Äì358), with Memnon and Mentor as his generals. When the revolt failed, Memnon and Artabazos II fled to Pella, the capital of Macedonia, whereas Memnon's brother Mentor fled to Egypt. Eventually Mentor returned to Persian service in about 343 BC. =In Macedon= During his exile in Macedon, Memnon got acquainted with Philip II and the young prince Alexander (later Alexander the Great), who was seven years old at the time. According to Plutarch, Memnon and Alexander had lengthy discussions, with Alexander reportedly having keen interest in Persia's military strength and tactics, amongst others. Though Schuster notes that the details of the conversations between Memnon and Alexander are difficult to verify, he does add that Memnon managed to get a proper impression of Philip II as a ruler, military leader and diplomat during his time in Pella. Moreover, it convinced him of Philip II's intentions to invade Persia, and he got a proper realization of the deep-seated Greek dissatisfaction vis-a-vis the Macedonian hegemony over Greece, including the political issues that came along with it for the Macedonians. Through the \\"influence\\" of his brother, after a stay of about three to four years in Macedon, Memnon re-entered the Persian service, \\"with a clear understanding of Macedonia's military capabilities\\". =Defense of the Achaemenid Empire= Campaigns against Philip II Coinage of Memnon of Rhodes, probably minted in Lampsakos, Mysia. Mid 4th century BC. Obv: Youthful head of Helios, with radiate solar disk. Rev: Rose with buds to either side, letter M-E on either sides. When Mentor died in c. 340 BC, Memnon married his widow Barsine. In 339 BC, Memnon helped to defend Byzantium against an assault by Philip II. In 336 BC Philip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of Memnon of Rhodes. Campaigns against Alexander the Great When Philip's son Alexander invaded the Persian Achaemenid Empire in 334 BC, Memnon, aware of the political issues the Macedonians dealt with, urged king Darius III (336‚Äì330 BC) to orchestrate a rebellion in Greece and he advised the Persian satraps to lay waste to the land that Alexander would have to pass, depriving his army of food and supplies. This would make it harder for Alexander and his army to survive on their long journey before the battle. The satraps did not trust Memnon because of his nationality, and did not ravage their territories. Initially hesitant, Darius made Memnon the commander of the western satrapies (provinces) after the defeat at the Battle of Granicus. During the defense of Halicarnassus, Memnon was the leading commander, and nearly defeated Alexander's attack. He then started using the empire's naval superiority against Alexander and started negotiations with Sparta in order to take the war to mainland Greece. He began a campaign to capture the Aegean islands using the Persian fleet and led a direct assault on Macedonia, while Alexander was resting at Phaselis. Memnon managed to capture the island of Chios and most of Lesbos. Demosthenes, after hearing of Memnon's successes, began to prepare Athens for a revolt against Alexander, along with other Greek cities, while Sparta began to prepare for war. By a stroke of fortune for Alexander, Memnon died during the siege of Mytilene, after transferring command to his nephew, Pharnabazus. Memnon's widow Barsine later became a mistress to Alexander and bore him a son, Heracles. After Alexander's death, Heracles contended for the throne with Nearchus' initial support (who himself had married Barsine's daughter by Mentor). Their bid met insufficient support, and Barsine and Heracles were murdered in 309 BC by Polyperchon. Assessment Many scholars maintain that had Memnon's campaign been successful, Alexander would have had difficulty in continuing his campaign in Asia, and might have soon been defeated. Memnon's naval campaigns and the uprising he orchestrated in Sparta posed the greatest danger to Alexander since he had become king. Schuster notes that if Memnon hadn't died at Mytilene, \\"Alexander might have been forced to abandon Asia Minor and return home to defend his throne\\". Thus, when Alexander realized he had nearly been defeated, he decided to invade Achaemenid Phoenicia first before moving into the empire's interior. It was not until after the major Persian defeat at the Battle of Issus that Memnon's strategy was revitalised and finally put into action, but by then the advantage had been lost, and Alexander showed himself willing to forfeit Greece if necessary in favor of his greater goals.

It is long and runs from the southern tip of Sweden at Trelleborg, into Norway and through almost all of the country north to the Arctic Circle and Nordkapp. The route ends in Kirkenes close to the Russian border.  Route  The Svinesund Bridge crosses the border between Norway and Sweden From south to north, E6 runs through Trelleborg, Malm√∂, Helsingborg, Halmstad, Gothenburg, Svinesund in Sweden, before crossing the border at the Svinesund Bridge into Norway. It then passes Halden, Sarpsborg, Moss to the capital Oslo. North of this, it passes by Gardermoen, Hamar, Lillehammer, Domb√•s, Oppdal, Melhus to Trondheim. Beyond Trondheim, the E6 meets Stj√∏rdal, Verdal, Steinkjer, Grong, Mosj√∏en, Mo i Rana, Saltdal, Fauske and Hamar√∏y towards Bognes, where there is a ferry crossing over the Tysfjorden to Skarberget. It then runs through on via Narvik, Setermoen, Nordkjosbotn, Skibotn and Alta to Olderfjord, where European route E69 continues north towards Nordkapp. The E6, meanwhile, turns south towards Lakselv and Karasjok, then runs on the west bank of the Anarjohka, which forms the border with Finland. Beyond the border, it passes through Varangerbotn, and Kirkenes, where the road terminates just east of the town center. Between Trelleborg and Kirkenes, there is a more than 800 km (500 mi) shorter route using E4 and E75, among the longest detour any European route has. In Finnmark there are several shorter alternative routes to the E6.  Features  E6 south of Narvik The road is a 2+2 lane motorway from outside Trelleborg to Brumunddal, about 720 km. The last Swedish part of the E6 motorway between Oslo and Gothenburg were completed in 2015. This motorway is also connected to central Europe by uninterrupted motorway (via E20). Some stretches further north also have four lanes or motorway standard. The rest of the road is ordinary road, usually 6‚Äì10 m wide. Some parts in the north of Norway are less than wide, making it very tight when heavy vehicles meet. The northern half of the road, north of Trondheim, is also often fairly curvy, making high speeds in such parts a possible safety hazard. E6 passes over treeless mountain passes in a few places in Norway. In the winter, bad weather and snow storms can cause the road to be temporarily closed, though unlike many minor roads, it is kept open wherever practical. Because the road is the main artery through the country, cyclists and leisure travellers avoid the southern sections owing to the excessive traffic, though in the north traffic is sparse anyway.  History  This road was called E6 in the old \\"E\\" road system before 1975 and previously continued to Rome (introduced in Sweden 1962 and in Norway 1965). It was given the number E47 (but not signposted) in the new system on most of the Scandinavian part (Helsingborg‚ÄìOlderfjord), and E6 only for the northernmost (from Olderfjord in Finnmark). After a political negotiation, the whole part passing through Scandinavia was given the number E6 in the new system, introduced in Scandinavia in 1992. The part Trelleborg- Helsingborg was never intended to be part of E47. E47 connects to E4 at the Helsing√∏r-Helsingborg ferry, and E4 and E6 connect just outside Helsingborg. The E6 became 4-lane motorway all the way from Trelleborg to Kolomoen (near Hamar) in 2015, although the road is sometimes wider. The new Svinesund Bridge opened in 2005, replacing an earlier and narrower bridge from 1946. A further 60 kilometre road between Brumunddal and √òyer is under conversion to 4-lane motorway, set to be finished around 2025. In Tr√∏ndelag, several sections north and south of Trondheim are under construction, or planned as motorways, this project is planned to be 106 kilometers long and it will go from the junction with Norwegian National Road 3 at Ulsberg in the south to √Ösen north of Trondheim Airport, V√¶rnes, it will be financed by the state owned company Nye Veier.

G. Wells, first published in 1904. Wells called it \\"a fantasia on the change of scale in human affairs. . . . I had hit upon [the idea] while working out the possibilities of the near future in a book of speculations called Anticipations (1901).\\"H.G. Wells, \\"Preface,\\" in Seven Famous Novels (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1934), p. ix. There have been various B-movie adaptations. The novel is about a group of scientists who invent a food that accelerates the growth of children and turns them into giants when they become adults. Plot summary The Food of the Gods is divided into three \\"books\\": \\"Book I: The Discovery of the Food\\"; \\"Book II: The Food in the Village\\"; and \\"Book III: The Harvest of the Food.\\" =Book I= Book I begins with satirical remarks on \\"scientists,\\" then introduces Mr. Bensington, a research chemist specialising in \\"the More Toxic Alkaloids,\\" and Professor Redwood, who after studying reaction times takes an interest in \\"Growth.\\" Redwood's suggestion \\"that the process of growth probably demanded the presence of a considerable quantity of some necessary substance in the blood that was only formed very slowly\\" causes Bensington to begin searching for such a substance.The Food of the Gods, Book I, Ch. 1. After a year of research and experiment, he finds a way to make what he calls in his initial enthusiasm \\"the Food of the Gods,\\" but later more soberly dubs Herakleophorbia IV. Their first experimental success is with chickens that grow to about six times their normal size on an experimental farm at Hickleybrow, near Urshot in Kent (where H.G. Wells was born and raised).The Food of the Gods, Book I, Ch. 2. Unfortunately Mr. and Mrs. Skinner, the slovenly couple hired to feed and monitor the chickens, allow Herakleophorbia IV to enter the local food chain, and the other creatures that get the food grow to six or seven times their normal size: not only plants, but also wasps, earwigs, and rats.The Food of the Gods, Book I, Ch. 3. The chickens escape, overrunning a nearby town. Bensington and Redwood, impractical researchers, do nothing until a decisive and efficient \\"well-known civil engineer\\" of their acquaintance named Cossar arrives to organize a party of eight to (\\"Obviously!\\") destroy the wasps' nest, hunt down the monstrous vermin, and burn the experimental farm to the ground. As debate ensues about the substance, popularly known as \\"Boomfood,\\" children are being given the substance and grow to enormous size: Redwood's son (\\"pioneer of the new race\\"The Food of the Gods, Book I, Ch. 4, Section 6.), Cossar's three sons, and Mrs. Skinner's grandson, Caddles. A certain Dr. Winkles makes the substance available to a princess, and there are other giants as well. These massive offspring eventually reach about 40 feet in height. At first the giants are tolerated, but as they grow more and more, restrictions are imposed. With time, most of the English population comes to resent the young giants, as well as changes to flora, fauna, and the organisation of society that become more extensive with each passing year. Bensington is nearly lynched by an angry mob, and subsequently retires from active life to Mount Glory Hydrotherapeutic Hotel.The Food of the Gods, Book I, Ch. 5, Sections 2‚Äì3. =Book II= Book II offers an account of the development of Mrs. Skinner's grandson, Albert Edward Caddles, as an epitome of \\"the coming of Bigness in the world.\\"The Food of the Gods, Book II, Ch. 1, Section 1. Wells takes the occasion to satirize the conservative rural gentry (Lady Wondershoot) and Church of England clergy (the Vicar of Cheasing Eyebright) in describing life in a backward little village.The Food of the Gods, Book II. =Book III= Book III begins with a chapter entitled \\"The Altered World\\" that dramatizes how life has changed by portraying the shocked reaction of a Rip van Winkle-like character released from prison after being incarcerated for 20 years. British society has learned to cope with occasional outbreaks of giant pests (mosquitoes, spiders, rats, etc.), but the coming to maturity of the giant children brings a reactionary politician, Caterham, into power. Caterham has been promoting a program to destroy the Food of the Gods and hinting that he will suppress the giants, and now begins to execute his plan. By coincidence, it is just at this moment that Caddles rebels against spending his life working in a chalk pit and sets out to see the world. In London, he is surrounded by thousands of tiny people and confused by everything he sees. He demands to know what it is all for and where he fits in, but no one can answer his questions; after refusing to return to his chalk pit, Caddles is shot and killed by the police.The Food of the Gods, Book III, Ch. 3. The conclusion of the novel features a tenderly described romance between the young giant Redwood and the unnamed princess. Their love blossoms just as Caterham, who has at last attained a position of power, launches an effort to suppress the giants. But after two days of fighting, the giants, who have taken refuge in an enormous pit, have held their own. Their bombardment of London with shells containing large quantities of Herakleophorbia IV forces Caterham to call a truce. The British leader is satirized as a demagogue, a \\"vote-monster\\" for whom nothing but \\"gatherings, and caucuses, and votes ‚Äì above all votes\\" are real.The Food of the Gods, Book III, Ch. 4, Section 4. Caterham employs Redwood p√®re as an envoy to send a proposed settlement, whose terms would demand that the giants live apart somewhere and forgo the right to reproduce. The offer is indignantly rejected at a meeting of the giants, where one of Cossar's sons expresses a belief in growth as part of the law of life: \\"We fight not for ourselves but for growth, growth that goes on for ever. Tomorrow, whether we live or die, growth will conquer through us. That is the law of the spirit for evermore. To grow according to the will of God!\\"The Food of the Gods, Book III, Ch. 5, Section 3. The novel concludes with the world on the verge of a long struggle between the \\"little people\\" and the Children of the Food, whose ultimate victory is perhaps suggested by the novel's final image: \\"For one instant [a son of Cossar] shone, looking up fearlessly into the starry deeps, mail-clad, young and strong, resolute and still. Then the light had passed and he was no more than a great black outline against the starry sky, a great black outline that threatened with one mighty gesture the firmament of heaven and all its multitude of stars.\\"The Food of the Gods, Book III, Ch. 5, Section 3. Film, TV and theatrical adaptations Bert I. Gordon adapted the work to the movies twice. First, he wrote, produced, and directed (for Embassy Pictures) Village of the Giants (1965). In this film, the substance, called simply \\"Goo\\", is developed by an 11-year-old Ron Howard. This is consumed by a gang of teenaged troublemakers (led by Beau Bridges) who become giants and take over the town, turning the tables on the knee-high adults. They are eventually defeated by other teens (led by Tommy Kirk). The Food of the Gods was released by American International Pictures in 1976, again written, produced, and directed by Gordon. Based on a portion of the book, it reduced the tale to an 'Ecology Strikes Back' scenario, common in science fiction movies at the time. The movie was not very successful. However, it did receive a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Rodent Movie of All Time, beating such competitors as The Killer Shrews (1959), The Mole People (1956), The Nasty Rabbit (1965), and Night of the Lepus (1972). In 1989, Gnaw: Food of the Gods, Part 2 was released, written by Richard Bennett and directed by Damian Lee. Dealing with a pack of giant lab rats wreaking havoc on a college campus, it was even further removed from the book than Gordon's attempts. Comic book adaptions The Food of the Gods was first adapted for the comics in January 1961, for Classics Illustrated #160, with a painted cover by Gerald McCann, script by Alfred Sundel and interior artwork by Tony Tallarico.William B. Jones, Jr., Classics Illustrated: A Cultural History, Second Edition (McFarland 2011), pp. 225, 333. The giant wasps were depicted in only two panels and the giant rats do not appear at all. A more dynamic and dramatic version, \\"told in the mighty Marvel manner,\\" was found in Marvel Classics Comics #22 (Marvel Comics 1977). Writer Doug Moench greatly improved on the Classics Illustrated script, while Sonny Trinidad produced new artwork. \\"Deadly Muffins\\" in Secrets of Sinister House #13 (DC Comics 1973) is an uncredited version of the story written by John Albano and drawn by Alfredo Alcala.

History Culloden village was originally made up of estate houses attached to Culloden House.Ordnance Survey grid reference for Culloden House: Historic buildings include Culloden House itself, which is now a hotel, the Culloden stables, now rebuilt as holiday homes, and the historic tithe barn which is now the Barn Church. Additional interesting buildings nearby include the Loch Lann Kennels, the Doocot and the ice house. In the 1960s an area near the historic village was drained for a council housing project, including Culloden Stores, Culloden AcademyCulloden Academy website and Duncan Forbes Primary School, named after the Forbeses of Culloden, who owned Culloden House from 1626 to 1897. More recent private housing developments have since grown up around it. Culloden House is now a luxury country house hotel. The parish of Culloden includes three other communities: Balloch , Smithton and Westhill. Like Culloden, Balloch is a village of some antiquity. Smithton and Westhill are post-war housing developments. Battlefield of Culloden Today, the battlefield of Culloden is under the care of the National Trust for Scotland, and its visitors' centre is a huge tourist attraction.

This well was traditionally visited on the first Sunday in May. Until the early 1970s, this pilgrimage was well attended with 'buses laid on to cater for the crowds. The practice of visiting on a specific day has declined sharply in recent years. A similar, and better known, well is near Munlochy. This tradition may be based on Celtic ceremonies, involving votive offerings to water spirits.

Robinson was born in Westgrove, Douglas, County Cork and raised in a Protestant and Unionist family in which he was the youngest of seven children. His father, Andrew Robinson, was a middle-class stockbroker who in 1892 decided to become a clergyman in the Church of Ireland in the small Ballymoney parish, near Ballineen in West Cork. A sickly child, Robinson was educated by private tutor and at Bandon Grammar School. In August 1907, his interest in the theatre began after he went to see an Abbey production of plays by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory at the Cork Opera House. He published his first poem that same year. His play, The Cross Roads, was performed in the Abbey in 1909 and he became manager of the theatre towards the end of that year. Shortly after joining the Abbey Theatre, he was sent to London for three months to train under George Bernard Shaw as his assistant while he was directing Misalliance. He resigned in 1914 as a result of a disastrous tour of the United States but returned in 1919. He was appointed to the board of the theatre in 1923 and continued to serve in that capacity until his death, his Abbey career and production involvement can be found in the Abbey archives As a playwright, Robinson showed himself as a nationalist with plays like Patriots (1912) and Dreamers (1915). On the other hand, he belonged to a part of Irish society which was not seen as fully Irish. This division between the majority native Irish (Roman Catholics) on one side and the Anglo- Irish (Protestants) on the other can be seen in a play such as The Big House (1926), which depicts the burning of a Protestant manor home by the IRA. Robinson's most popular play was The Whiteheaded Boy (1916). Other plays included Crabbed Youth and Age (1924), The Far Off Hills (1928), Drama at Inish (1933), and Church Street (1935). Drama at Inish, which was presented in London and on Broadway as Is Life Worth Living?, was revived as part of the 2011 season at the Shaw Festival (Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada), with Mary Haney as Lizzie Twohig. Robinson's fiction includes Eight Short Stories (1919). In 1931 he published a biography of Bryan Cooper, who had recently died. In 1951, he published Ireland's Abbey Theatre, the first full-length history of the company. He published an edited edition of Lady Gregory's diaries in 1947. In 1958 he co-edited (with Donagh MacDonagh) The Oxford Book of Irish Verse'.. He was also a director and producer, in 1930 he produced a play by Irish playwright Teresa Deevy called The Reapers and in 1931 he was co-director of A Disciple along with W. B. Yeats and Walter Starkie. Personal life Robinson married artist Dorothy Travers Smith, the Abbey Theatre stage designer. Their correspondence is in the Library of Trinity College Dublin. Dorothy Travers-Smith's mother was spiritualist Hester Dowden, the daughter of Irish literary scholar Edward Dowden. He is buried in St. Patrick's Cathedral. The Abbey Players wished to attend the service but having been told by the Archbishop that any Catholic setting foot in the Cathedral or graveyard would be committing a mortal sin, only one attended.

The town shares borders with Sungei Kadut to the north, Tengah to the southwest, Bukit Batok to the southeast, Bukit Panjang to the east and the Western Water Catchment to the west. Choa Chu Kang New Town is separated into two portions by the Kranji Expressway. Originally a kampung, the area has been rapidly developed under the ambition of the Housing and Development Board, to transform it into a modern township. The town comprises seven subzones, five of which are the most densely populated: Choa Chu Kang Central, Choa Chu Kang North, Yew Tee, Teck Whye, and Keat Hong. Etymology Choa Chu Kang's name is derived from its historical core at the former site of Chua Chu Kang Village located near the junction of Choa Chu Kang Road and Jalan Sungei Poyan, currently occupied by the grounds of the National Shooting Centre which comes under the purview of Singapore Shooting Association. The name began to be applied to the general area around the village when Choa Chu Kang Road, a main arterial road linking the village to Upper Bukit Timah Road towards the east was built. The name \\"Choa Chu Kang\\" is derived from the Teochew word \\"kang chu\\". In the nineteenth century, Chinese immigrants to plant gambier and pepper along the river banks of Choa Chu Kang, although many migrated to Johor to the north at the encouragement of the Temenggong of Johor. The plantation owners were known as Kangchu - the word \\"kang\\" refers to the riverbank and \\"chu\\" means \\"owner\\" or \\"master\\", referring to the headman in charge of the plantations in the area. \\"Choa\\" is the clan name of the first headman. History =Early history= Choa Chu Kang was a diverse area with old kampong housing and rubber plantations. Residents had to depend on boats or bullock carts for transportation. Among the few villages which sprang up were Kampong Belimbing and Chua Chu Kang Village. Most of the inhabitants belonged to the Teochew dialect group. The early Teochew settlers were mainly farmers growing gambier and pepper. The Hokkiens, who moved in later, established pineapple, rubber and coconut plantations as well as vegetable farms and poultry farms. In the early days, tigers used to roam in the area. The last tiger of Singapore was shot here in the 1930s. Kampong Belimbing, Chua Chu Kang Village and Kampong Berih was demolished in phases from 1993 to 1998. It was replaced by National Shooting Centre and military plot (Cemetery North) and (Jalan Bahar). The Cemetery North is gazetted as an army restricted and live-firing area from 19 September 2003. The Jalan Bahar is gazetted as an army restricted and live-firing area from 16 March 2001.Training Plot 2 (Jalan Bahar) The name Choa Chu Kang is used for Choa Chu Kang Road and its nearby facilities. However, the original name Chua Chu Kang is retained in the cemetery area. =New town era (1980s)= The new town era had been evolved since 1985 where Teck Whye was developed (the first HDB blocks since 1980), and it was extended to N2, N3 and N4 by 1992 with the cutting short of Choa Chu Kang Road. Yew Tee was developed by 1997, with N5, N6 and N7 being completed and residents had moved in. There is still a military training area at Yew Tee/Kranji Camp premises, which is since 6 February 2002. The camps are Kranji and Mowbray Camps. Choa Chu Kang also had their new neighbourhood being completed, the Neighbourhood 8 by 2015. On 25 April 2015, bus services such as 300, 301 and 983 were being enhanced for their needs of residents. Bus service 301 and 983 took over the deleted portions of service 300. On 27 December 2015, service 983 was also extended via Choa Chu Kang Avenue 1, Choa Chu Kang Avenue 7, Choa Chu Kang Grove, Choa Chu Kang Way, Choa Chu Kang Road, Upper Bukit Timah Road, Petir Road, Jelebu Road all the way to Bukit Panjang to enhance connectivity to the Downtown MRT Line. Politics When Choa Chu Kang Town was built by expanding Teck Whye Estate near the other end of Choa Chu Kang Road at its junction with Upper Bukit Timah Road and Woodlands Road to the north, the place name began to be applied to a much larger area, especially when political divisions like the Choa Chu Kang ward applied to the entire northwest sector of the country during some editions of the Parliamentary elections. Likewise, the residents' committees in Choa Chu Kang were expanded in 1988 and 1991, and part of Chua Chu Kang sector had given way to Yew Tee division, followed by Keat Hong division in 2001. The growing demand of Keat Hong Neighbourhood 8 also requested for redrawing of boundaries whereby Limbang ward took over the parts of Yew Tee and Choa Chu Kang, giving a nice feel of Neighbourhood 5 and 6. Today, the Yew Tee and Limbang wards fall within the Marsiling-Yew Tee Group Representation Constituency and the rest of the town such as Keat Hong and Chua Chu Kang fall within the Chua Chu Kang Group Representation Constituency. In 2020, with the further growth of Keat Hong Neighbourhood 8 and Tengah New Town, Brickland ward was introduced, taking over parts of Keat Hong, Bukit Gombak, Chua Chu Kang and Nanyang. Education , this area has a total of eight primary schools and six secondary schools, together with Pioneer Junior College.School Information Service Choa Chu Kang is home to the newest addition to ITE College West which was constructed and completed in 2010. Transportation facilities City planners plan for public transport to eventually become the preferred mode of transport in the future. The government of Singapore ideally desires environmental towns, using public transport to reduce pollution caused by heavy road traffic. Choa Chu Kang is part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's focus for realising this urban planning model and is still undergoing an expansion of its town. As Choa Chu Kang is relatively distant from the city centre at the Central Area, an efficient, high-volume and high-speed public transport system is also preferred to using road networks. Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station and Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange are conveniently connected to each another in the town centre to allow seamless travel for the residents of Choa Chu Kang New Town across the different available modes of public transport. =Public transport= Rail The Choa Chu Kang MRT station is a major transport hub. Choa Chu Kang New Town is linked to the Central Area and to the other lines on the MRT/LRT system (to the East-West Line at Jurong East station, to the Circle Line at Bishan station, and the North East Line at Dhoby Ghaut station) through the North South Line (NSL) at Choa Chu Kang station (NS4) located at Choa Chu Kang Town Centre. It usually takes an hour for passengers to travel from Choa Chu Kang to the Central Area which changes at Jurong East. The intra-town Bukit Panjang LRT is a 7.8 km light rail line that serves to link residents to the town centre and the nearby town of Bukit Panjang, hence the line's name. It is a fully driverless system. Yew Tee station (NS5), the other station along NSL in Choa Chu Kang New Town, serves the housing developments in Yew Tee, the industrial estate of Sungei Kadut, and the northern part of Choa Chu Kang New Town. The station started operations on 10 February 1996. Like Choa Chu Kang, it usually takes an hour for passengers to travel from Yew Tee to the Central Area when using the station which changes at Jurong East. Bus services alt= Bus services are available at the Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange which is connected to the Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station and the town's central shopping mall Lot One Shoppers' Mall. It was opened in 1990 with 12 bus services under SBS Transit and at their own Choa Chu Kang Bus Package, all handed over to SMRT Buses in 1999. On 16 December 2018, the interchange was relocated to a new facility at the junction of Choa Chu Kang Way and Choa Chu Kang Loop, with the old interchange being demolished due to the construction of the Jurong Region Line. All services were amended to the new interchange on that day. The bus interchange currently has 15 services; 14 are public bus services (mostly operated by SMRT Buses, the other a special free shuttle to Qian Hu Fish Farm. Typically passenger traffic is often very high in morning and evening peak hours. Bus services were introduced over the years in Choa Chu Kang: *25 April 2015: Service 983 was introduced from Choa Chu Kang to Keat Hong Close, and extended on 27 December 2015 to Bukit Panjang. *27 December 2015: Service 979 was introduced from Bukit Panjang to Yew Tee. *15 May 2016: Service 308 was introduced from Choa Chu Kang to Keat Hong Link (Loop). *8 April 2018: Service 974 was introduced from Bukit Panjang Temporary Bus Park to Joo Koon. *30 September 2018: Service 991 was even extended from Bukit Batok West, via Bukit Gombak MRT, Bukit Batok West Avenue 5, Brickland Road, Choa Chu Kang Avenues 3 and 1, and Keat Hong Link to Choa Chu Kang, replacing route 308. *10 November 2019: Service 976 was introduced from Choa Chu Kang to Bukit Panjang. In addition, 300 and 302 were the last bus routes to be converted to use double deckers after the articulated buses starts retiring in 2017. Road network The northern part of the much-used Bukit Timah Road (called Upper Bukit Timah Road) connects Choa Chu Kang residents to other parts of the country. The Kranji Expressway (KJE) links Choa Chu Kang Town up with Singapore's expressway network. With the KJE, drivers can change onto the Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE) which in turn, is connected to the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) which travels to the Central Area and the eastern parts of Singapore. As the town is surrounded by the towns of Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak and southern Woodlands, many roads (old and new) have been constructed to link Choa Chu Kang into other towns which eventually allows residents to other parts of the country by either bus, train, car or any other reliable means of transportation. The following roads connect the central town of Choa Chu Kang to the nearby towns of Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang: * Bukit Batok Road (links Choa Chu Kang with Bukit Batok and Jurong East) * Choa Chu Kang Road * Upper Bukit Timah Road (northern section connects with Choa Chu Kang Road) * Teck Whye Avenue * Bukit Panjang Road * Brickland Road * Woodlands Road The following roads connect the central town of Choa Chu Kang to its northern counterpart neighbourhood, Yew Tee: * Choa Chu Kang Way * Choa Chu Kang Drive (parallel to the track between Choa Chu Kang and Yew Tee MRT stations) Amenities =Commercial= Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station with Lot One shopping mall in the background There are two main shopping centres in Choa Chu Kang. Lot One is the main shopping mall by CapitaLand and it is a major hub in Choa Chu Kang,. Its anchor tenants are NTUC FairPrice, Shaw Theatres, BHG, Cotton On and Choa Chu Kang Community Library. The other two shopping malls in Choa Chu Kang are Yew Tee Square and Yew Tee Point which was located in Yew Tee, owned by Frasers Centrepoint. The mall has undergone enhancement works to create a four-storey retail extension block measuring over 16,500 sq ft (1,530 m2). The works, which commenced in July 2007, was completed by end-2008. For Junction 10, it is a shopping mall by Far East Organisation, which is located at Ten Mile Junction. There is Giant Hypermarket nearby as an anchor tenant. The other shopping malls are neighbourhood malls. They are Choa Chu Kang Centre, Keat Hong Shopping Centre, Limbang Shopping Centre, Sunshine Place and Teck Whye Shopping Centre. They are smaller scale. =Medical= The estate also contains a polyclinic renovated in 2010. It is operated by the National University Polyclinics. There is also a newly setup Keat Hong Family Medicine Clinic (FMC) which is a collaboration between National University Hospital (NUH) and Trilink Healthcare Pte Ltd in the new Keat Hong Community Club building. =Parks, recreational and sport venues= *Choa Chu Kang Park ‚Äì a major park of the town located in the northern part of Choa Chu Kang *Choa Chu Kang Stadium ‚Äì the town's major stadium which was a practice venue for the 2010 Youth Olympic Games *Choa Chu Kang Swimming Complex ‚Äì located adjacent to Choa Chu Kang stadium located in Yew Tee *Tembusu Park *Limbang Park *Choa Chu Kang Mega Playground *Stagmont Park *Yew Tee Park Military Camps *Stagmont Camp *Kranji Camp I,II, III *Mowbray Camp *Police K-9 Unit *SAF Detention Barracks References Places in Singapore West Region, Singapore New towns in Singapore Hokkien place names New towns started in the 1980s ","title":"Choa Chu Kang"},{"id":"987948","text":"Justine Elinor Frischmann (born 16 September 1969)Jews Who Rock (2016) is an English artist and musician. She was the lead singer of the Britpop band Elastica, before retiring from the music industry and pursuing a career as a painter. Early years Frischmann was born on 16 September 1969 in Kensington, London, the daughter of Wilem Frischmann, a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who is the former chairman of the Pell Frischmann company of consulting engineers and a Russian mother. Her parents are both Jewish. She grew up in Twickenham, London, and attended St Paul's Girls School, before studying at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London. Career =Art= Frischmann has said, \\"The themes and ideas I am working with are in direct relation to an ongoing personal narrative; the big questions are reflected in the choices I make in my art...[including] my ever- evolving relationship with my spiritual faith. I think my approach and aesthetics reveal internal struggles and speak to my family origins and history.\\" In 2005, Frischmann moved to Boulder, Colorado, where she studied visual arts at Naropa University, a small, Buddhist-inspired liberal arts college. In 2012 her work was shortlisted for the UK's Marmite Prize for painting, and she has been included in 1000 Living Painters. =Music= Frischmann began writing and studying music at the age of eleven. She was a founding member of the band Suede with Brett Anderson, whom she met at UCL in 1988. She left the band in October 1991. In the 2018 documentary \\"The Insatiable Ones\\", Anderson cites her as huge influence on the band's first album. Frischmann later founded and fronted her own band, Elastica. Their first album, Elastica, released in 1995, became the fastest selling debut album in UK history. They were signed to Deceptive Records in the UK, and later with Geffen Records in Europe and the US. In 1994, Elastica was voted Best New Band by NME readers at the Brat awards. In 1995, Elastica was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize for their album Elastica. The album went on to sell over a million copies worldwide. In 2001 the band announced an amicable breakup, citing, in part, burnout from a grueling touring schedule. Frischmann spent the next few years developing artist M.I.A. whom she discovered. M.I.A. was Frischmann's friend and flatmate. Frischmann co-wrote and produced M.I.A.'s demos for her first album, Arular, most notably its 2003 single \\"Galang\\". Frischmann left London in 2005 to enroll in a masters program at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, and \\"become a nobody\\". In a 2016 interview regarding her art career, Frischmann stated, \\"I don't really have any desire to make music, to be honest.\\" In 2017, Rough Trade Records released a remastered version of Elastica's first eponymously titled album. That year, there were rumours that Elastica had been asked to perform at M.I.A.'s Meltdown at the Southbank. In 2019, Rough Trade released a limited edition Elastica BBC sessions album on UK Record Store Day. =Television= In 2003, Frischmann co-presented a series called Dreamspaces for the BBC Television about modern architecture. In 2004, she presented the UK's premier and longest-running arts programme The South Bank Show and was a judge for the RIBA Stirling Prize for Architecture. Personal life Frischmann previously dated her Suede bandmate Brett Anderson. She then dated Blur lead singer Damon Albarn from 1991 until their break-up in 1998, which served as inspiration for the band's 1999 single \\"No distance left to run\\". Frischmann is now married to a climate scientist, Ian Faloona, and lives and works in the USA.

Her birth year is also sometimes listed as being 1906.https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias- almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/parlo-dita-1906-1971 Parlo made her first film appearance in Homecoming (Heimkehr) in 1928 and quickly became a popular actress in Germany. During the 1930s she moved easily between German and French films, achieving success in several films, including, in the span of four years, two that are considered among the greatest in cinema history: L'Atalante (1934) and La Grande Illusion (1937). She was deported to Germany as an enemy alien during World War II, but returned to France in 1949 and resumed her career. Parlo attempted to establish a career in American films but despite a couple of roles in Hollywood films, was unable to extend her European success. In the late 1930s, she was scheduled to appear in the Orson Welles production of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness for RKO Radio Pictures. However, that project did not come to pass. With the outbreak of World War II, Parlo returned to Germany. She appeared in only three films during the last thirty years of her life, making her final film appearance in 1965.

Portrait of William John Burchell by Thomas Herbert Maguire (1854). Wagon commissioned by Burchell for his expedition.  William John Burchell (23 July 1781 ‚Äì 23 March 1863) was an English explorer, naturalist, traveller, artist, and author. His thousands of plant specimens, as well as field journals from his South African expedition, are held by Kew Gardens, and his insect collection by the Oxford University Museum. Early life and education William John Burchell was born in Fulham, London, the son of Matthew Burchell, botanist and owner of Fulham Nursery, and his wife. His father owned nine and a half acres of land adjacent to the gardens of Fulham Palace. Burchell served a botanical apprenticeship at Kew and was elected F.L.S. (Fellow of the Linnaen Society) in 1803. At about this time, he became enamoured of Lucia Green of Fulham, but faced strong disapproval from his parents when he broached the idea of an engagement. Career On 7 August 1805 Burchell at the age of 24 sailed for St. Helena aboard the East Indiaman intending to set up there as a merchant with a partner from London, William Balcombe (1779-1829). After a year of trading, Burchell did not want to continue and dissolved the partnership. Three months later he accepted a position as schoolmaster on the island and later as official botanist. In 1810 he sailed to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa on the recommendation of Gen. J.W. Janssens to explore and to add to his botanical collection. Burchell's intended wife had jilted him for the captain of the boat taking her to St. Helena to join him. Landing at Table Bay on 26 November 1810, after stormy weather had prevented a landing for 13 days, Burchell set about planning an expedition into the interior. He left Cape Town in June 1811. Burchell travelled in South Africa through 1815, collecting over 50,000 specimens, and covering more than 7000 km, much over unexplored terrain. He described his journey in Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa, a two- volume work appearing in 1822 and 1824. (It was reprinted in 1967 by C. Struik of Cape Town.) He is believed to have planned a third volume, since the second ends long before he completed his journey. On 25 August 1815 he sailed from Cape Town with 48 crates of specimens aboard the vessel Kate, calling at St. Helena and reaching Fulham on 11 November 1815. Given his experience and knowledge of South Africa, in 1819 Burchell was closely questioned by a select committee of the British House of Commons about the suitability of the area for emigration. The 1820 Settlers went out from England a year later. He spent time cataloguing and processing his specimens, and raising funds for his next expedition. Burchell travelled in Brazil between 1825 and 1830, again collecting a large number of specimens, including more than 20,000 insects. The journals covering his Brazil expedition are missing, as are his diaries relating to his later travels. His field note books, detailing his plant collections, are held in the collection of Kew Gardens. Historians have used them to reconstruct the latter part of his trip. Burchell's extensive African collections included plants, animal skins, skeletons, insects, seeds, bulbs and fish. After his death, his plant specimens, drawings and manuscripts, both South African and Brazilian, were presented by his sister, Anna Burchell, to Kew Gardens and the insects to Oxford University Museum. He is known for the copious and accurate notes he made to accompany every collected specimen, detailing habit and habitat, as well as the numerous drawings and paintings of landscapes, portraits, costumes, people, animals and plants. Burchell died in Fulham in 1863, ending his own life by hanging himself in a small outhouse in his garden, after a non-fatal suicide attempt by shooting. He is buried near his home at All Saints Church, Fulham. Published works  Legacy and honours He is commemorated in the monotypic plant genus Burchellia R. Br. Numerous animal species were named for him: Burchell's zebra, Burchell's coucal, Burchell's sandgrouse, Burchell's courser, and the Eciton burchellii army ant. A species of African lizard, Pedioplanis burchelli, is named in his honour. (\\"Burchell\\", p. 43).

It is named after J√∏rgen Pedersen Gram. Examples For finite-dimensional real vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^n with the usual Euclidean dot product, the Gram matrix is simply G = V^\\\\mathsf{T} V, where V is a matrix whose columns are the vectors v_k. For complex vectors in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, G = V^* V, where V^* is the conjugate transpose of V. Given square-integrable functions \\\\\\\\{\\\\ell_i(\\\\cdot),\\\\, i = 1,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} on the interval \\\\left[t_0, t_f\\\\right], the Gram matrix G = \\\\left[G_{ij}\\\\right] is: : G_{ij} = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_f} \\\\ell_i(\\\\tau)\\\\ell_j^*(\\\\tau)\\\\, d\\\\tau. For any bilinear form B on a finite- dimensional vector space over any field we can define a Gram matrix G attached to a set of vectors v_1,\\\\dots, v_n by G_{ij} = B\\\\left(v_i, v_j\\\\right). The matrix will be symmetric if the bilinear form B is symmetric. =Applications= Properties =Positive-semidefiniteness= The Gram matrix is symmetric in the case the real product is real-valued; it is Hermitian in the general, complex case by definition of an inner product. The Gram matrix is positive semidefinite, and every positive semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix for some set of vectors. The fact that the Gramian matrix is positive-semidefinite can be seen from the following simple derivation: : x^\\\\textsf{T} \\\\mathbf{G} x = \\\\sum_{i,j}x_i x_j\\\\left\\\\langle v_i, v_j \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\left\\\\langle x_i v_i, x_j v_j \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sum_i x_i v_i, \\\\sum_j x_j v_j \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\\\\\sum_i x_i v_i \\\\right\\\\|^2 \\\\geq 0 . The first equality follows from the definition of matrix multiplication, the second and third from the bi-linearity of the inner-product, and the last from the positive definiteness of the inner product. Note that this also shows that the Gramian matrix is positive definite if and only if the vectors v_i are linearly independent (that is, \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_i x_i v_i eq 0 for all x). =Finding a vector realization= Given any positive semidefinite matrix M, one can decompose it as: : M = B^* B, where B^* is the conjugate transpose of B (or M = B^\\\\textsf{T} B in the real case). Here B is a k \\\\times n matrix, where k is the rank of M. Various ways to obtain such a decomposition include computing the Cholesky decomposition or taking the non-negative square root of M. The columns b^{(1)}, \\\\dots, b^{(n)} of B can be seen as n vectors in \\\\mathbb{C}^k (or k-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^k, in the real case). Then : M_{ij} = b^{(i)} \\\\cdot b^{(j)} where the dot product a \\\\cdot b = \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=1}^k a_\\\\ell^* b_\\\\ell is the usual inner product on \\\\mathbb{C}^k. Thus a Hermitian matrix M is positive semidefinite if and only if it is the Gram matrix of some vectors b^{(1)}, \\\\dots, b^{(n)}. Such vectors are called a vector realization of M. The infinite-dimensional analog of this statement is Mercer's theorem. =Uniqueness of vector realizations= If M is the Gram matrix of vectors v_1,\\\\dots,v_n in \\\\mathbb{R}^k, then applying any rotation or reflection of \\\\mathbb{R}^k (any orthogonal transformation, that is, any Euclidean isometry preserving 0) to the sequence of vectors results in the same Gram matrix. That is, for any k \\\\times k orthogonal matrix Q, the Gram matrix of Q v_1,\\\\dots, Q v_n is also M. This is the only way in which two real vector realizations of M can differ: the vectors v_1,\\\\dots,v_n are unique up to orthogonal transformations. In other words, the dot products v_i \\\\cdot v_j and w_i \\\\cdot w_j are equal if and only if some rigid transformation of \\\\mathbb{R}^k transforms the vectors v_1,\\\\dots,v_n to w_1, \\\\dots, w_n and 0 to 0. The same holds in the complex case, with unitary transformations in place of orthogonal ones. That is, if the Gram matrix of vectors v_1, \\\\dots, v_n is equal to the Gram matrix of vectors w_1, \\\\dots, w_n in \\\\mathbb{C}^k, then there is a unitary k \\\\times k matrix U (meaning U^* U = I) such that v_i = U w_i for i = 1, \\\\dots, n., p. 452, Theorem 7.3.11 =Other properties= * The Gram matrix of any orthonormal basis is the identity matrix. * The rank of the Gram matrix of vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^k or \\\\mathbb{C}^k equals the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors. Gram determinant The Gram determinant or Gramian is the determinant of the Gram matrix: : G(x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) = \\\\begin{vmatrix} \\\\langle x_1,x_1\\\\rangle & \\\\langle x_1,x_2\\\\rangle &\\\\dots & \\\\langle x_1,x_n\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle x_2,x_1\\\\rangle & \\\\langle x_2,x_2\\\\rangle &\\\\dots & \\\\langle x_2,x_n\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\ddots&\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle x_n,x_1\\\\rangle & \\\\langle x_n,x_2\\\\rangle &\\\\dots & \\\\langle x_n,x_n\\\\rangle \\\\end{vmatrix}. If x_1, \\\\cdots, x_n are vectors in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, then it is the square of the n-dimensional volume of the parallelotope formed by the vectors. In particular, the vectors are linearly independent if and only if the parallelotope has nonzero n-dimensional volume, if and only if Gram determinant is nonzero, if and only if the Gram matrix is nonsingular.

The Basilica is one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and one of the five former \\"patriarchal basilicas\\", each of which was assigned to the care of a Latin Church patriarchate. The Basilica was assigned to the Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The Basilica is the shrine of the tomb of its namesake, Saint Lawrence (sometimes spelled \\"Laurence\\"), one of the first seven deacons of Rome who was martyred in 258. Many other saints and Bl. Pope Pius IX are also buried at the Basilica, which is the center of a large and ancient burial complex.  History  Before the present-day Basilica was constructed, the former estate upon which it sits was once home to a small oratory built by Emperor Constantine I. The Emperor built it over the site on which it tradition held that St. Lawrence was buried in 258. In the 580s, Pope Pelagius II commissioned the construction of a church over the site in honor of the Saint. In the 13th century, Pope Honorius III commissioned the construction of another church in front of the older one. It was adorned with frescos depicting the lives of Saint Lawrence and the first martyred deacon, St. Stephen, who is interred with St. Lawrence in the crypt, or confessio, under the high altar. The two structures were later united during a program of urban renewal. Excavations have revealed several other crypts of various persons, buried below the contemporary street level. Pope St. Hilarius is also buried here. The portico of circa 1220 has Cosmatesque decoration by the Vassalletto family of craftsmen. The 13th-century frescoes, which were reconstructed, depict scenes from the lives of St. Lawrence and St. Stephen, both being martyred, young deacons. There are two ancient sarcophagi in the portico: a Christian one, possibly decorated in the 7th century on an older sarcophagus, has a relief depicting putti (cherubs) picking grapes. While vines and grapes are symbols of the Holy Eucharist, these images are probably not symbols thereof. Further, two Romanesque stone lions were moved here from the old entrance. The campanile was built in the 12th century. Immediately inside the entrance is the tomb of Guglielmo Cardinal Fieschi, who died in 1256, but was entombed in an ancient sarcophagus, itself being incidentally carved with a relief depicting a pagan marital feast. Inside, the choir enclosure and pulpit have Cosmatesque decoration, and there is also a fine Cosmatesque Paschal candlestick from the 12th or 13th century. The antique Ionic capital on the column directly behind the pulpit has carvings of a frog and a lizard. On the triumphal arch are Byzantine mosaics from the 6th century, depicting Christ with saints. The confessio below the high altar is entered from the nave. Here, St. Lawrence and St. Stephen are enshrined. The latter was transferred from Constantinople by Pope Pelagius II during his restoration of the Basilica. Behind the high altar is a Papal altar with an inscription of the names of the makers, namely the Cosmati family, and dating it to 1148. The Basilica was home to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem from 1374 to 1847. In 1943 the Basilica was bombed during the Second World War. Restoration continued until 1948, allowing some accretions from the 19th century to be removed. However, the frescoes on the facade were destroyed. The Basilica adjoins a major cemetery, and therefore holds a large number of funerals.

Sarai was the seat of Batu and his successor Berke. Under them Sarai was the capital of a great empire. The various Rus' princes came to Sarai to pledge allegiance to the Khan and receive his patent of authority (yarlyk).MacKenzie, David, Michael W. Curran. (2002).

The bishops of Krutitsy resided in Tsarev from 1261 to 1454. It had probably succeeded Sarai Batu as the capital of the Golden Horde by the mid-14th century. Sarai was described by the famous traveller Ibn Battuta as \\"one of the most beautiful cities ... full of people, with the beautiful bazaars and wide streets\\", and having 13 congregational mosques along with \\"plenty of lesser mosques\\". Another contemporary source describes it as \\"a grand city accommodating markets, baths and religious institutions\\". An astrolabe was discovered during excavations at the site and the city was home to many poets, most of whom are known only by name. Both cities were sacked several times. Timur sacked New Sarai around 1395, and Me√±li I Giray of the Crimean Khanate sacked New Sarai around 1502. The forces of Ivan IV of Russia finally destroyed Sarai after conquering the Astrakhan Khanate in 1556. In 1623‚Äì1624, a Russian merchant, Fedot Kotov, travelled to Persia via the lower Volga. He described the site of Sarai: > Here by the river Akhtuba stands the Golden Horde. The khan's court, > palaces, and courts, and mosques are all made of stone.

Little Sarai  Sarai Juk (Little Sarai) was a city on the Ural River. It is often conflated with the other Sarais in historical and modern accounts.

The Fairey IIFs were quickly replaced by Hawker Osprey floatplanes and Supermarine Walrus flying boats, and in 1937 these were supplemented by Fairey Seafox floatplanes. By July 1938 it had consolidated on the Walrus as equipment, and in early 1939 it was upgraded to full squadron status. It was disbanded on 21 January 1940, when all the Fleet Air Arm's catapult units were merged to form 700 Naval Air Squadron. The squadron was reformed on 1 August 1944 at RNAS Fearn near Tain, Scotland, as an operational training squadron equipped with the Fairey Barracuda. It moved to RNAS Rattray (HMS Merganser) near Crimond, Aberdeenshire in October 1944.

Their music has sometimes been described as \\"noir rock\\", due to its sultry, dark and mysterious inflections, be it sonically or lyrically. The band uses mainly acoustic instruments, predominantly guitar, piano, bass and drums, with the occasional appearance of eastern instruments, classical strings, and subtle electronics, the focal point being the voice of Charles in the forefront. Based in New York City, Elysian Fields have found underground success in the United States but are more popular in Europe. The author of The Dark Stuff, Nick Kent, says of their music, \\"Maybe we have their out-of-the- mainstreamness to thank for a sound that is still unique -- as sensual as a sleepwalker's wet dream.\\" Since its formation, the band has won quite a devoted cult following, largely by word of mouth. Besides its well received albums, the band is also noted for its strong live performances. The rest of the band has included many of New York's strongest players: all the members of Jeff Buckley's band, members of Medeski Martin and Wood, Ed Pastorini, Ben Perowsky, James Genus, Thomas Bartlett, Jamie Saft and members of Ollabelle have all played in Elysian Fields at various times.  History  Founders Jennifer Charles and Oren Bloedow had in common a mutual love for artists of multiple genres such as The Beatles, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Captain Beefheart, Ravi Shankar, and classical composers like Frederic Chopin and Olivier Messiaen. Elysian Fields first released an EP in 1995 on Radioactive/Universal Records with cameos from John Lurie and Marc Ribot, which was followed with the critically acclaimed full- length album, Bleed Your Cedar. The band then recorded its second album with Steve Albini which was never released because of artistic differences between the band and the record company. Despite their record company's urgings, Charles and Bloedow did not want to give the recording a more commercial feel, prompting a split with Radioactive/Universal, who retain the recording. Charles said, \\"We made our second full length with Steve Albini. It wasn't at all what the label was looking for, or wanted. The label wanted us to redo things, go in with more commercial people, and give them songs that they could sell. I didn't want to mess with what we made with Steve. It was what it was. In the end we agreed to disagree, I asked to be released from my contract, and we parted ways. For now it sits in some vault gathering dust, I suppose.\\" In 2000, the band recorded a one-off album for Jetset records, Queen of the Meadow, which the band toured extensively in Europe, and which reached number 5 on the CMJ charts in the US. Robert Wilson went on to use one of the songs, \\"Rope of Weeds\\", in one of his plays. In June 2003, the band released Dreams That Breathe Your Name in France and Benelux on PIAS and Bang Records respectively, followed by an American release in 2004 on their own label Diluvian. The album was called \\"Close to noir-rock perfection\\" by the TimeoutNY music editor, Mike Wolf. A further album, Bum Raps and Love Taps, was released in Europe in late 2005/early 2006 on the Naive label and lead to the band touring in Europe for much of 2005 and 2006. The album is dedicated to Charles' grandmother, about whom the title track was written. Another song \\"'Duel with Cudgels\\", eight minutes and thirty seconds, takes its title from a Goya painting. Their music is lush and melancholy, with poetic and sometimes surreal lyrics. In fall 2006, the video artist Vincent Moon filmed two live videos of Elysian Fields for La Blogotheque (also seen on YouTube), one of which is for the song \\"We're in Love\\", the duo acoustic final track on the Bum Raps album. This album was finally released in the US in late 2008 on the band's Diluvian imprint. In addition to contributing to many of John Zorn's produced compilation records, including one of Marc Bolan and the first track on the Serge Gainsbourg tribute, Charles and Bloedow also released two complete albums of Sephardic songs on Zorn's Tzadik label, the first being \\"La Mar Enfortuna\\" and \\"Convivencia\\". They give ancient Moorish melodies a revamp with their signature Elysian Fields sound. Charles sings in Ladino as well as in Arabic, Aramaic, Spanish and Greek on these albums. Elysian Fields have also performed in several tribute concerts produced by the impresario Hal Willner, including one of Randy Newman's songs in Los Angeles, where Oren was a musical director, and another for Edgar Allan Poe. Elysian Fields performed at the Carnegie Hall on April 5, 2007, in Michael Dorf's all star tribute to Bruce Springsteen; Oren was once again musical director, backing up several artists including Badly Drawn Boy, and Bruce Springsteen himself for the rousing finale of \\"Rosalita\\". Elysian Fields rendition of \\"Streets of Fire\\" was noted in both Billboard and Rolling Stone as being one of the show's highlights, and described as \\"sensual\\" and \\"passionate\\". In February 2009, Elysian Fields performed in Paris in a sold-out show at the Salle Pleyel, as part of John Zorn's Serge Gainsbourg tribute concert alongside Marc Ribot and Sean Lennon. In 2009, the band released The Afterlife on Vicious Circle records, which was received with high critical praise. European tours followed, along with sold-out concerts in several major cities. Elysian Fields' music has appeared in films as well as many television shows including Damages, Conviction, Smallville, Charmed, One Tree Hill, Extra, The Crow and Lipstick Jungle. \\"Black acres\\" from Queen of the Meadow was used in a 2011 Lavazza advertisement. Influences Jennifer Charles cited singers of many styles including Anita O'Day, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee and Blues singers. She's also been inspired by the likes of the Lounge Lizards, Nick Cave, Lydia Lunch, Foetus, Siouxsie, and The Captain.

A self-described \\"world punk\\" band, Firewater incorporate many diverse elements of world music with punk rock rhythms, including cabaret, ska, jazz, folk and most notably Eastern European influences such as klezmer and gypsy music, which has led to their inclusion in the gypsy punk genre. , Firewater has released seven studio albums and has seen some success, particularly in Europe and on United States college radio stations. They are currently signed to Bloodshot Records. Biography After Tod left his previous group, Cop Shoot Cop, he quickly regrouped and formed Firewater to explore the styles of music Cop Shoot Cop had only hinted at, including klezmer, gypsy, jazz, and ska forms. Labeled a musical collective, Tod has remained Firewater's only consistent member, acting as singer-songwriter and bassist/guitarist. Throughout their fluctuating line-up, the band has occasionally featured numerous notable musicians, including Duane Denison of the Jesus Lizard, Yuval Gabay of Soul Coughing, David Ouimet of Motherhead Bug and Foetus, Jennifer Charles of Elysian Fields, Hahn Rowe, Tamir Muskat and Ori Kaplan of Gogol Bordello and Balkan Beat Box. Their album, Songs We Should Have Written (2004), is a collection of cover songs. It includes songs written by Robyn Hitchcock, The Rolling Stones (\\"Paint It Black\\" reinterpreted as a crawlingly slow raga which \\"shove(s) a few downers down the song's throat to counter the original version's adrenaline-fueled fire\\"), and a \\"dark and sweet\\" take of Sonny and Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\", described as \\"10 times more ominous and 20 times more pleasurable\\" than the original. The album also includes a modern rendition of the Johnny Cash anthem \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\". After recording Songs We Should Have Written, singer Tod A took an extended, three-year sabbatical, traveling through Thailand, India, Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia and chronicling his experiences on his blog \\"Postcards from the Other Side of the World.\\" During this time, he wrote and recorded the band's sixth studio album The Golden Hour with the help of various local musicians and friends, including Firewater producer Tamir Muskat. The record was released May 6, 2008, through Bloodshot records in USA and Noise-o-lution in Europe. Firewater's seventh studio album, International Orange!, was released in September 2012, accompanied by international touring.

He swam in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, winning a total of four Olympic gold medals. Early years Krayzelburg is Jewish, and was born to Jewish parents in Odessa (then Soviet Union, now Ukraine). Krayzelburg and his family left the Soviet Union in 1989 for the United States. They settled in Los Angeles. After their immigration, Krayzelburg's family suffered from financial difficulties. He had to commute by bus and on foot 45 minutes each way to swimming practice, and did not get home before 9:30 in the evening. In addition, Lenny had to cope with language problems, and to study English rapidly in order to understand his coaches' instructions. Thankfully he was aided by the extensive Russian community in Los Angeles, and managed to adapt quickly. College Lenny first attended Fairfax High School, and then attended Santa Monica College where he won both the 100 and backstroke junior college titles. His coach at Santa Monica recognized his talent and recommended him to Mark Schubert at the University of Southern California. Lenny transferred to USC. In 1995, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Three years later, he became the first swimmer since 1986 to sweep the backstroke events, 100 m & 200 m, in the World Championships. In 1999, Krayzelburg broke the 50, 100 and the 200 m world records respectively, setting the clock on 24.99, 53.60 and 1:55.87. He was then recognized as the top backstroke swimmer in the world and one of the best in the history of this swimming style. He continued to dominate at the 2000 Summer Olympics backstroke, shattering the Olympic record and nearing his own 1999 world record with 53.72 in the 100, while making another Olympic record in the 200 with a 1:56.76. He also played an important role in helping the American team win a gold medal in the 4 √ó 100 m relay with a new world record of 3:33.73. Maccabiah Games After the Olympics Krayzelburg decided to skip the 2001 World Championships that took place in Fukuoka, Japan, in order to focus on the 2001 Maccabiah Games in Israel. Being Jewish, Krayzelburg wanted to take this once-in-a-lifetime chance to compete with other top Jewish athletes. In addition, he wanted to fulfill a childhood dream by visiting the holy land, and lifting the American delegate flag during the games' opening ceremony. He was selected to carry in the flag for the United States at the opening ceremonies.\\"Maccabiah Games\\" He then earned gold and set a new Maccabiah record in the 100-meter backstroke. He also won a gold medal in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. At the 2017 Maccabiah Games, in the special 4x50m relay race between Israeli and American all-star teams, American Olympic champions Krayzelburg, Jason Lezak (four Olympic golds), and Anthony Ervin (three Olympic golds), with masters swimmer Alex Blavatnik, swam a time of 1:48.23 and defeated Israeli Olympians Guy Barnea, Yoav Bruck, Eran Groumi, and Tal Stricker, who had a time of 1:51.25.\\"Records fall as Olympians shine at Maccabiah Games,\\" The Jerusalem Post. Difficulties, perseverance A couple of months later he had to undergo surgery on his left shoulder, following a fall while running on a treadmill, after which he had to take a year off swimming. In September 2003, Krazelburg split from his coach Mark Schubert, to start training under Dave Salo, who also coached Aaron Peirsol. Peirsol was considered by many to be Krayzelburg's successor. Working with Salo, Krayzelburg changed the style of his stroke, particularly due to his shoulder injuries. Success This turn in Krayzelburg's career proved to be successful. He finished second in the American trials for the 100 meters event to secure a place in the 2004 Athens Olympics, alongside training partner, Aaron Peirsol. His good shape enabled him to reach the finals. He came into this final knowing this might be his career's last, but missed out on a medal by just 2/100 of a second, with a qualitative result of 54.38, whereas Peirsol won gold with 54.06. Krayzelburg made up for the upset by helping the American team to win yet another Olympic gold in the 4 x 100 m relay, despite not swimming in the final of this event (he swam in the preliminary round, while Peirsol took his spot in the final). Krayzelburg is known as one of the physically strongest swimmers around, and for his powerful arm strokes, a product of his training regimen and bodybuilder-esque physique. He is tall and weighs just above . Lenny owes many of his career achievements to his father Oleg, who has often encouraged him, even when Lenny wanted to quit at the age of 14. He enjoys reading as well as working with computers. Krayzelburg was named Sportsman of the Year by the United States Olympic Committee in 1998, and was chosen USA Swimmer of the Year each of the following two years. In 2001, he was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and USC Hall of Fame.http://www.lennykswim.com/about-lenny-krayzelburg.php See also * List of multiple Olympic gold medalists * List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games * List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men) * List of select Jewish swimmers * List of University of Southern California people * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming (men) * World record progression 50 metres backstroke * World record progression 100 metres backstroke * World record progression 200 metres backstroke * World record progression 4 √ó 100 metres medley relay References External links    1975 births Living people American male backstroke swimmers American people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent World record setters in swimming Jewish American sportspeople Jewish swimmers Maccabiah Games gold medalists for the United States Maccabiah Games medalists in swimming Competitors at the 2001 Maccabiah Games Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Medalists at the FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) Olympic gold medalists for the United States in swimming Olympic swimmers of the United States Sportspeople from Odessa Odessa Jews Soviet emigrants to the United States Sportspeople from Los Angeles Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Swimmers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Ukrainian emigrants to the United States USC Trojans men's swimmers World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Goodwill Games medalists in swimming ","title":"Lenny Krayzelburg"},{"id":"988056","text":"Taiz√© is the Taiz√© Community, a monastic order in Taiz√©, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, France.

He set the NFL single-season scoring record in 1933 and led the league in total offense. He was the last surviving member of the Detroit Lions inaugural 1934 team and helped lead the team to its first NFL championship in 1935. He also set an NFL record with a 54-yard field goal in 1934, a record which was not broken for 19 years. Presnell served as the head football coach at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln in 1942 and at Eastern Kentucky State College‚Äînow known as Eastern Kentucky University‚Äìfrom 1954 to 1963, compiling a career college football coaching record of 45‚Äì56‚Äì3. He was also the athletic director at Eastern Kentucky from 1963 to 1971. Early years Born in Gilead, Nebraska, Presnell attended DeWitt High School and the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln. He played college football as a halfback for the Nebraska Cornhuskers football team from 1925 to 1927. In 1925, Presnell led Nebraska to a 14‚Äì0 victory over an Illini team that included the \\"Galloping Ghost\\", Red Grange. As one writer put it, \\"all the galloping was done by Presnell this day.\\" Presnell was selected as a first-team player on the 1927 College Football All-America Team. Professional football After leaving Nebraska, Presnell played football for the Ironton Tanks in Ironton, Ohio. He was a player-coach for the team and also taught science at Ironton High School. Presnell was a halfback in Ironton's single wing offense and also played on defense at what would later be considered the safety position. Although not officially part of the National Football League, the Tanks played against teams in the league. In 1930, Presnell led Ironton to victories over both the New York Giants and the Chicago Bears. Against the Giants, the Tanks trailed 12-6 with three seconds left. Presnell threw a touchdown pass to Gene Alford and then kicked the extra point to give Ironton a 13‚Äì12 victory over a Giants team that finished in second place in the NFL. He also scored two touchdowns against the Bears, including an 88-yard run. After the 1930 season, the Tanks folded. In 1931, Presnell joined the Portsmouth Spartans in the NFL. He remained with Portsmouth from 1931 to 1933. He had his best season in 1933, when he led the NFL in total offense with 1,296 yards. He also broke the single-season NFL scoring record with 64 points. (Ken Strong tied with Presnell with the same point total in 1933.) During the 1933 NFL season, Presnell completed 50 of 125 passes for 774 passing yards and added 522 rushing yards on 118 carries for an average of 4.4 yards per carry. He also kicked five field goals and 13 extra points. He led the NFL with six rushing touchdowns and 13 successful extra point conversions. He also finished second in the league (behind Harry Newman) in passing touchdowns, passes completed, pass attempts, and passing yards. Following the 1933 season, Presnell was selected as a first-team All-NFL player by the NFL, the United Press, and Collyers Eye Magazine. In 1934, the owner of the Portsmouth Spartans sold the team. The team was moved from Portsmouth, Ohio to Detroit, Michigan, and became the Detroit Lions. When Presnell visited Detroit to sign his first contract with the Lions in 1934, team owner George A. Richards allowed Presnell to pick the team's colors. Presnell later recalled: > \\"Mr. Richards, the owner, the day I was up there and signed my contract, he > said: 'There's a table out there in the next office covered with uniforms. > Why don't you pick out the colors you like?' I went out. My wife was with > me. We saw this Honolulu blue and silver and we fell in love with it.\\" Presnell remained with the Lions from 1934 to 1936. He combined with Dutch Clark, Ace Gutowsky, and Ernie Caddel to lead the Lions to a second-place finish in 1934. And in 1935, the same group led the Lions to their first NFL championship, culminating with a 26-7 victory over the New York Giants in the 1935 NFL Championship Game. Presnell also set an NFL record with a 54-yard field goal in 1934, a mark that was not broken until 1953. Coaching and later years Presnell retired as a player after the 1936 season at age 31. He worked as an assistant football coach at the University of Kansas in 1937 and then as the backfield coach at Nebraska from 1938 to 1941. In February 1942, he became the head football coach and athletic director at Nebraska. The Cornhusers, compiled a record of 3-7 in Presnell's one season as head coach. In December 1942, Presnell enlisted in the United States Navy. In May 1943, he was commissioned as a lieutenant and assigned to the Navy's physical education training program. In 1944 Presnell served as backs coach at the North Carolina Pre-Flight School. He spent three years in the Navy. In 1954, Presnell returned to coaching as the head football coach for Eastern Kentucky University. He held that position from 1954 to 1963. He was then athletic director at Eastern Kentucky until his retirement in 1971. Presnell died in September 2004 in Ironton, Ohio at the age of 99. He had been the last surviving member of the Detroit Lions' inaugural 1934 team.

When the Swedes invaded Geatland (G√∂taland), the Geatish king H√¶√æcyn was killed by the Swedish king Ongen√æeow. Hygelac, who became the new king, sent Eofor and his brother Wulf to fight against the hoary-bearded Swedish king. During the fight Wulf was severely wounded, but Eofor slew Ongen√æeow and carried Ongen√æeow's arms to Hygelac. Eofor and Wulf were not only richly recompensed, but Eofor was given the greatest possible gift for his service, the daughter of Hygelac. J. R. R. Tolkien, who studied Beowulf intensively, used the name √âofor as the name of a prince of a warrior people in the background history for The Lord of the Rings. Eofor is Old English for \\"boar\\". It is widely agreed that Ongen√æeow is identical to King Egil (also Angantyr) in the Ynglingasaga. In this saga, Egil is killed by a bull, which likely originates from a mistranslation of the Ynglingatal, where he was killed by a boar. As such, it's possible that this means that the name Eofor was misinterpreted in later stories as a literal boar that killed the king of the Swedes.

He is best known for his appearances with professional wrestling promotions World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation in the late-1990s and 2000s, where he held the WCW World Tag Team Championship and WWF/E World Tag Team Championship. He hosted the Discovery Channel series Lords of the Car Hoards. Early life Chuck Palumbo grew up in Providence, Rhode Island. He attended West Warwick High School, where he earned all-state honors in basketball. He joined the US Navy soon after and spent time in the Persian Gulf, working the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson. He was initially assigned to an F-18 Hornet squadron VAQ-34 at Lemoore, California before transferring to NAS Miramar in San Diego where he worked on the E-2C Hawkeye. Chuck finished up his stint in the Navy and enrolled at the Community College of Rhode Island earning All-American honors in basketball and a full scholarship to University of Central Missouri. While attending Central Missouri, he saw a sign at a WCW event to call a phone number if you wish to become a pro wrestler. He called the number, and after graduating with a Criminal Justice degree, decided to accept their invite to travel to Atlanta and train at the WCW Power Plant. Professional wrestling career =World Championship Wrestling= Training and undercard (1998‚Äì1999) Palumbo began his career in 1998 on the independent circuit, using a surfer gimmick and the ring name \\"The Dude\\". He made his debut appearance on World Championship Wrestling (WCW)'s Nitro on October 19, 1998 as a fan who accepted the challenge of Ernest \\"The Cat\\" Miller. Six months later, he was offered a training contract by WCW in April 1999. Just prior to the hiring of Vince Russo and Ed Ferrera as bookers for WCW, many of the WCW Power Plant wrestlers debuted on Saturday Night and WorldWide. Palumbo's initial WCW run was under the name Jungle Jim, his gimmick being a man of the jungle. Palumbo was undefeated in matches on the lower-tier programs, which were mostly against other Power Plant graduates. World Tag Team Champion (2000‚Äì2001) In 2000, Palumbo made his debut on the March 22, 2000 edition of Thunder under his real name, losing to Scott Steiner. After this match, Palumbo was chosen by Bischoff and Russo to be the New Blood's version of Lex Luger in May 2000. He was given the nickname \\"The Main Event\\". Palumbo feuded with Luger until late May 2000 when Palumbo formed a team called \\"The Perfect Event\\" with Shawn Stasiak and the pair won the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Their main feud was against KroniK (Brian Adams and Bryan Clark). In August, Stasiak and Palumbo helped form The Natural Born Thrillers with Mike Sanders, Sean O'Haire, Mark Jindrak, and Reno. They were briefly \\"coached\\" by Kevin Nash. Palumbo and Stasiak won the WCW Tag Team Championship two more times before splitting in early January 2001 when he and Stasiak won a tag team battle royal with O'Haire and Jindrak for a future tag team title shot. After the conclusion of the match Mike Sanders declared both teams victorious and that any combination of the four would face The Insiders (Diamond Dallas Page and Kevin Nash). Palumbo and O'Haire were the two members of the Natural Born Thrillers who would face and defeat Page and Nash for the tag titles at Sin on January 14, 2001. Following the title victory, the Natural Born Thrillers broke up when the team of Jindrak and Stasiak became jealous of Palumbo and O'Haire. The teams faced each other at SuperBrawl Revenge on February 18, 2001 for the tag team title, which Palumbo and O'Haire retained. The duo also retained the title against Totally Buffed (Buff Bagwell and Lex Luger) at Greed in March, WCW's last pay-per-view. On the final episode of Nitro, Palumbo and O'Haire defeated Team Canada's Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in the final WCW World Tag Team Championship title defense on the program. =World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment= The Alliance (2001) Palumbo and O'Haire made their WWF debuts on the June 28, 2001, episode of SmackDown! as part of The Alliance, attacking the Hardy Boyz. O'Haire and Palumbo started feuding with the Acolytes Protection Agency (A.P.A.) in the following weeks, which ended at WWF Invasion on July 22, 2001 when the Acolytes Protection Agency defeated them. Subsequently, O'Haire and Palumbo defeated the Hardy Boyz on the August 2, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. O'Haire and Palumbo next dropped the WCW Tag Team title to The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) on the August 9, 2001 edition of SmackDown! and lost their rematch for the tag-team gold in a steel cage match the following week on Raw. O'Haire and Palumbo's last televised match together was on the August 26 edition of Heat defeating The Holly Cousins (Hardcore and Crash). O'Haire was sent to developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling in early September 2001, and Palumbo was thrown out of The Alliance on the October 25 edition of Smackdown by storyline co-owner of The Alliance, Stephanie McMahon. He joined the WWF in November. Billy and Chuck (2001-2002) Big Boss Man (right) present Captain Doug Dupuoy of the U.S. Navy a WWF Championship Belt in 2002 When he returned, Palumbo found a tag team partner in Billy Gunn. The pair started as a tag team working dark matches, but were later given a gimmick that saw the pair grow increasingly affectionate towards each other, showing evidence of a homosexual relationship. Palumbo became known simply as Chuck, and he bleached his hair blond to match Gunn's. On the February 21, 2002 edition of SmackDown!, Billy and Chuck defeated Tazz and Spike Dudley to win the World Tag Team Championship. Palumbo made his WrestleMania debut at WrestleMania X8, when Billy and Chuck defend their titles in a Four corners elimination match against the APA, The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz. They lost the tag team gold to Rikishi and their stylist Rico Constantino, who was forced to team with Rikishi on May 19, 2002 at Judgment Day. Less than a month later Rico helped Billy and Chuck recapture the title, but they later lost it to Edge and Hulk Hogan. In the second half of 2002, Billy and Chuck were the source of controversy when Chuck apparently proposed to Billy on September 5, 2002 edition of SmackDown! asking him to be his \\"partner for life\\". They had a marriage ceremony on the 2002 season premiere of SmackDown!. Just before they tied the knot, however, they revealed that the entire ordeal was a publicity stunt, and both characters disavowed their on-screen homosexuality. When Billy and Chuck decided not to go through with the marriage, Rico turned on them by helping Eric Bischoff and 3-Minute Warning attack the duo. Rico subsequently jumped to Raw as the manager of 3-Minute Warning, who beat Billy and Chuck at Unforgiven. Billy was injured in early October 2002, and Chuck worked on Velocity for a few months using his original ring name Chuck Palumbo once again. The Full Blooded Italians and departure (2003‚Äì2004) In February 2003, Palumbo formed The Full Blooded Italians (F.B.I.) in WWE, a faction which had previously been seen in Extreme Championship Wrestling. After a beating at the hands of Rikishi, Nunzio threatened to bring in his \\"family\\" in order to gain revenge. The next week, Chuck Palumbo and Johnny \\"The Bull\\" Stamboli joined Nunzio to form the F.B.I. and attacked Rikishi. This version initially gained little success, but would go on to have brief feuds with Los Guerreros, Chris Benoit, Rhyno, Brian Kendrick, Nathan Jones, the APA, and The Undertaker. Palumbo was traded to the Raw brand on March 22, 2004 along with A-Train in exchange for Rico and Jackie Gayda. After Palumbo was traded to the Raw brand, he was kept off television until July 2004, when he debuted with a new look and entrance music. His new image resembled a cross between an auto mechanic and a greaser. He would later give himself the nickname \\"Custom Chucky P.\\" It was not long before Palumbo was a regular on Sunday Night Heat. His new gimmick started off usually losing matches but began to rise on Heat, defeating the likes of The Hurricane, Rosey, Val Venis and Stevie Richards. On the October 31, 2004 airing of Heat, Palumbo had his most high-profile match on the Raw brand when he faced former World Heavyweight Champion Chris Benoit, but was defeated. Palumbo was released by WWE soon after on November 4, 2004. =Independent circuit (2005)= Palumbo, along with Johnny Stamboli, went on to become a member of Voodoo Murders of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and feuded against Roughly Obsess and Destroy. Palumbo teamed with former FBI partner Stamboli to challenge for the World Tag Team Championship on March 20, 2005, but were defeated by Jamal and Taiyo Kea of RO&D.; Stamboli and Palumbo's next stop would be with the Nu-Wrestling Evolution promotion in Italy, where the pair reformed the FBI. The duo also made appearances in a World Wrestling Council show where they challenged √öltimo Drag√≥n, M√≠stico, and Negro Casas, in a tag team match which they would win by securing both the first and third falls. =Return to WWE (2006‚Äì2008)= William Regal (top) and Chuck Palumbo competing at a Raw house show in 2007 In March 2006, Palumbo re- signed with the WWE and began working house shows and dark matches over the next year. Palumbo officially returned on the May 25, 2007 edition of Heat with a biker gimmick, and defeated Charlie Haas. He then continued making appearances on Heat, where he consistently defeated jobbers. In an interview with WWE.com, Palumbo claimed that the biker character was not a gimmick and that he works on bikes two or three times a week. On July 6, 2007, Palumbo made his SmackDown! re-debut, defeating Kenny Dykstra in his return match. Palumbo began an on-screen relationship with Michelle McCool, whom he teamed with to defeat Dykstra and Victoria in a mixed tag team match. He then feuded with Jamie Noble, after Noble made advances towards McCool. After a series of matches between the men, Noble won a date with McCool by defeating Palumbo. Palumbo accidentally elbowed McCool during a match, causing her to suffer a storyline concussion. The partnership was dissolved when McCool refused to accept his apology the following week. Palumbo vowed to get revenge on Noble, and defeated Noble the following week. Palumbo participated in the Royal Rumble match, where he eliminated Jamie Noble. He next appeared at WrestleMania XXIV, taking part in a 24-man Interpromotional Battle Royal to crown a number one contender to the ECW Championship, where he also eliminated Noble. During a series of house shows in June 2008, Palumbo challenged Matt Hardy for the United States Championship, though he was unsuccessful in winning the championship. As part of the 2008 WWE Supplemental Draft, Palumbo was drafted to the Raw brand. He never made his return to the brand however, as he was released from his WWE contract on November 7, 2008. =Independent circuit (2008‚Äì2012)= Palumbo with the HEW Heavyweight Championship Palumbo returned to Mexico to team with Dami√°n 666 and Konnan in a losing effort against D-Generation MEX at Wrestling in Tijuana on December 25, 2008. He also teamed with Konnan in World Wrestling Association. Palumbo wrestled for Ultimo Dragon's Toryumon promotion and competed in the IWL World Title Tournament in Mexico as well. He returned to Nu-Wrestling (now named New Wrestling Entertainment, and located in France) in September 2009, and feuded with Mr. Anderson. Palumbo, Anderson and Tiny Iron competed in a triple threat for the vacant NWE Heavyweight Championship, which Anderson won. Palumbo challenged Anderson to a match for the championship on October 3, 2009, but was defeated. On November 13, 2009, Palumbo won the Herts and Essex Wrestling (HEW) Heavyweight Championship from Brett Meadows in Braintree, England. He is the first American to hold the British promotion's championship. However, he lost the championship back to Meadows two days later in Colchester, England following interference from Sam Knee and Britani Knight. In an interview with Hit The Ropes Radio, Palumbo confirmed he was in talks with TNA to sign with the company, though he opted not to sign. Palumbo wrestled his final match at Future Stars Wrestling's New Years Resolution event in 2012, where he defeated Jayson Cash. After this, he quietly retired, and confirmed to Bill Apter in a 2014 interview that his wrestling career was over. Other endeavors Palumbo runs a business called CP Kustoms, where he builds his own motorcycles, as well as repairing and customizing cars and motorcycles. A Palumbo-made motorcycle was featured in the April issue of American Iron Magazine. In 2009, Palumbo built a motorcycle to raise money for veterans returning home. He rode the bike across the country to gather donations and raffles, with 100% of the proceeds going to Fueled by the Fallen, a nonprofit that supports troops after they return home. While rehabbing his shoulder injury, Palumbo learned how to play guitar, and now plays in his own band, 3 Spoke Wheel. Using the same theme as CP Kustoms, he opened up Chuck Palumbo's Garage Gym, where he teaches cross-fit classes. In 2014, he began co-hosting the Discovery Channel's Lords of the Car Hoards with custom car builder Rick Dore. The show focuses on SLAM garage, the garage Dore and Palumbo co-own, to fix and customize cars and motorcycles. For the second season the show was renamed Rusted Development. Personal life Palumbo's brother, Chris, was awarded several medals for his military service in Afghanistan including the Silver Star. Palumbo also has two younger sisters, Kelly and Liz. Palumbo is good friends with fellow professional wrestlers Batista, Mark Jindrak, Booker T, Chavo Guerrero Jr. and Rey Mysterio. He was also close to former tag partner Sean O'Haire, who died September 8, 2014. Palumbo currently resides in El Cajon, California. He has a daughter named Charli, who is an aspiring DJ. In January 2016, Palumbo reportedly saved a woman from a car accident by lifting the car, then lifting the woman out of the car.

Life and work Adolf Reinach was born into a prominent Jewish family in Mainz, Germany, on 23 December 1883.Adolf Reinach (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) Adolf Reinach studied at the Ostergymnasium in Mainz (where he became at first interested in Plato) and later entered the University of Munich in 1901 where he studied mainly psychology and philosophy under Theodor Lipps. In the circle of Lipps' students he came in contact with Moritz Geiger, Otto Selz, Aloys Fischer and above all Johannes Daubert. From onward 1903/4 he was increasingly busy with the works of Edmund Husserl, especially his Logische Untersuchungen (Logical Investigations). In 1904, Reinach obtained his doctorate in philosophy under Lipps with his work √úber den Ursachenbegriff im geltenden Strafrecht (On the concept of cause in penal law). In 1905, he still intended to continue his studies in Munich (where in the meanwhile he had also befriended Alexander Pf√§nder), to obtain a degree in law, but then decided to go to study with Husserl at the University of G√∂ttingen. In that period more students of Lipps (captained by Daubert) had decided to abandon Munich and to head for G√∂ttingen, inspired by Husserl's works (which is referred to as the Munich invasion of G√∂ttingen). Later in 1905 Reinach returned to Munich to complete his studies in law and then continued in 1906‚Äì07 at the University of T√ºbingen. He attended several lectures and seminars on penal law by the legal theorist Ernst Beling, by which he was quite impressed and to which he owes a great deal of inspiration of his later works. In the summer of 1907 he took the First State Examination in Law, but also went later to G√∂ttingen to attend discussion circles with Husserl. With the support of Husserl, Reinach was able to obtain habilitation for university teaching at G√∂ttingen in 1909. From his lectures and research, we can see that at the time he was influenced also by Anton Marty and Johannes Daubert, besides obviously and greatly by Husserl. On his turn Reinach appears to have inspired several young phenomenologists (like Wilhelm Schapp, Dietrich von Hildebrand, Alexandre Koyr√© and Edith Stein) with his lectures. Besides giving an introduction to phenomenology, he lectured i.a. on Plato and Immanuel Kant. In this period, Husserl embarked on a thorough revision of his main work, the Logical Investigations, and asked Reinach‚Äôs assistance in this endeavour. Moreover, in 1912 Reinach, together with Moritz Geiger and Alexander Pf√§nder founded the famous Jahrbuch f√ºr Philosophie und ph√§nomenologische Forschung, with Husserl as main editor. Besides his work in the area of phenomenology and philosophy in general, Reinach is credited for the development of a forerunner to the theory of speech acts by Austin and Searle: Die apriorischen Grundlagen des b√ºrgerlichen Rechtes (The A Priori Foundations of Civil Law) is a systematic treatment of social acts as performative utterances and a priori foundations of civil law. Reinach's work was based mostly on Husserl's analysis of meaning in the Logical Investigations, but also on Daubert's criticism of it. Alexander Pf√§nder (1870‚Äì1941) had also been doing research on commands, promises and the like in the same period. After Husserl's publication of the Ideen (Ideas) in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories and the current of Munich phenomenology came effectively into being, as Reinach, Daubert and others chose to remain closer to Husserl's earlier work, the Logical investigations. Instead of following Husserl into idealism and transcendental phenomenology, the Munich group remained a realist current. Reinach was converted to Lutheranism along with his wifeTeresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein (1891‚Äì1942) At the outbreak of World War I Reinach volunteered to join the army. After many battles and having received the Iron Cross, Reinach fell outside Diksmuide in Flanders on 16 November 1917. After his death, Edith Stein was given the task of arranging his manuscript writings. Reinach had said shortly before his death that he would only teach philosophy in the future as a means of leading men to God, and this may have been reflected in these writings. But Edith Stein was impressed by the resignation and faith of his widow. She wrote, \\"This was my first encounter with the Cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it ... it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and Christ began to shine his light on me ‚Äì Christ in the mystery of the Cross.\\" Several years later she became a Christian and a Carmelite nun.

Wright and Lisa M. Nekhom, Historical Dictionary of Argentina (1978) pp 31-32 Early life He was born Santo √Ångel in the northern part of the Viceroyalty of the River Plate (now in Rio Grande do Sul) to a Spanish nobleman father, Diego de Alvear y Ponce de Le√≥n, and a criollo mother, Mar√≠a Balbastro and baptised Carlos Antonio del Santo √Ångel Guardi√°n. His birthplace Santo √Ångel was, at that time, part of Misiones Province, but currently belongs to the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. While travelling in Spain, Alvear's brothers and mother died in an incident that took place on October 5, 1804, when English frigates opened fire on the Spanish ship that was transporting them. This incident was a preamble to the Battle of Trafalgar and the consequent war between both countries. The English took Alvear and his father, together with other survivors, as prisoners to England, where Diego de Alvear would later marry an Irish woman. Honouring his mother, Carlos de Alvear adopted the name of Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear. Notwithstanding the fate of his mother and brothers at the hands of the English, 15-year-old Carlos was partially educated in the English culture, adopting, in his adult age, what some would later see as a position partial to English interests. Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu√©naga, Antonio Gonz√°lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos√© Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Bartolom√© Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo Jos√© de Urquiza; Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge, but whether that lodge was truly masonic has been debated: Military career Alvear was one of the few professional military officers to participate of the Argentine War of Independence on the side of the revolutionaries, having served in the Spanish Army during the Napoleonic Wars. He became an active Freemason. While in Cadiz, he founded the Sociedad de los Caballeros Racionales, a masonic secret society, made up of South Americans. Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, with whom Alvear would always have a conflictive and contradictory relationship, would later also become a member of this secret society. He returned to Buenos Aires on board the English frigate George Canning, in which were also travelling San Mart√≠n, Juan Mat√≠as Zapiola, Francisco Chilavert and other soldiers. Upon his arrival, Alvear was named Lieutenant Coronel of the young Argentine army. He led the action against the Royal army under Gaspar Vigodet in Montevideo, replacing Jos√© Rondeau and making the Oriental leader Jos√© Gervasio Artigas an enemy. Alvear was a leader of the constituent Assembly of the year 1813 and, goaded by political ambition, succeeded in establishing a Unitarian (centralizing) form of government, having his uncle Gervasio Antonio de Posadas named Supreme Director (chief executive). In early 1814, Alvear was appointed commander in chief of the forces defending the capital. A few months later, he replaced General Jos√© Rondeau as commander in chief of the army besieging Montevideo, the last bastion of Spanish power in the River Plate, which was defended by 5,000 troops. In late June 1814, as news that Ferdinand VII had recovered the crown of Spain, Alvear managed to force the surrender of the Spanish troops in Montevideo. It was the biggest victory for the cause of independence since 1810. He was only 25 and the most successful general of the revolution. He returned to Buenos Aires to claim his laurels but a revolt forced him back to the Banda Oriental. After a quick and decisive campaign, his forces defeated the caudillos that opposed the government. At the end of 1814 Alvear was named commander of the Army of the North, but he lacked of support from Posadas, and his unpopularity among the troops, and other disagreements‚Äîincluding a project for a constitutional monarchy that he sent to Europe to be negotiated by Manuel Belgrano, that was fiercely opposed by the League of Free Peoples‚Äîmade him return to Buenos Aires. On January 9, 1815, at 25 years of age, he was chosen to replace his uncle Posadas as Supreme Director. Having neither the support of the troops nor sufficient influence on the people of the hinterland provinces, Director Alvear then attempted to come to an alliance with Artigas, to whom he offered the independence of the Banda Oriental (current Uruguay). In exchange, Artigas would withdraw his army from the Argentine Littoral. But Artigas declined the offer, and Alvear sent troops to occupy the area. At this time he was in correspondence with the British ambassador in Rio de Janeiro, in order to ask for a British intervention. Following a mutiny among his troops, and under pressure from the Cabildo, Alvear resigned on April 15, and left the country. He was in exile in Rio de Janeiro until 1818. In May of that year, he moved to Montevideo where he joined his friend, the Chilean Jose Miguel Carrera, also exiled due to political differences with San Martin and Bernardo O'Higgins. =Diplomatic Missions to England, United States and Bolivia= Alvear returned to Argentina in 1822 thanks to an amnesty law (Ley del olvido). At the end of 1823, Bernardino Rivadavia named him minister plenipotentiary to the United States. Before going to Washington, Alvear stopped in London and managed to get an interview with George Canning, Britain's Foreign Secretary. Weeks after this interview, the British cabinet formally recognized the independence of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata. In 1825 Alvear was sent by the Buenos Aires government to Bolivia to meet with Sim√≥n Bolivar. The real objective of this mission was to seek Bolivar's support in the looming war with the Empire of Brazil, over the Banda Oriental. Alvear had also a project of his own: the creation of big republic in South America comprising Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay. He asked Bolivar to be its first president. The Venezuelan leader was sympathetic to this project but dissensions in Gran Colombia forced him to abandon it. =War Against the Empire of Brazil= To neutralize Alvear's political ambitions, newly elected President Bernardino Rivadavia appointed him his Minister of War and Navy in early 1826. In a short period of time, and with limited resources, Alvear was able to raise an army of 8.000 men to wage war against the Empire of Brazil. Conflicting claims over the Banda Oriental (which included current Uruguay) pushed both countries into conflict. Victory seemed unattainable to the Argentines. At the time, Brazil had a population of close to 5 million inhabitants (including 2 million slaves), a standing army of 120.000 men and a naval fleet of almost 80 vessels. In contrast, the fledgling Argentine Republic had only 700,000 inhabitants and faced the secession of almost half of its provinces. Fearing a Brazilian invasion of Argentine territory, in mid-1826, President Rivadavia appointed Alvear as commander in chief of the Argentine army, which was in mutiny. Alvear quickly restored discipline and put the troops in fighting condition. By the end of the year, after only three months on the job, he took the initiative and launched an invasion of the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Among Alvear's objectives was to promote a slave rebellion which would force the Emperor to seek an armistice. During the first months of 1827 Cisplatine War, the Argentine Army entered Brazilian territory and defeated the Brazilians at Bag√©, Omb√∫, Camacu√° and the great Battle of Ituzaing√≥, probably the most important victory of his career. It was his brilliant and fearless conduct during this campaign, and the memorable victory which ended it, that made controversial Alvear a national hero among Argentine people ever since. However, internal disenssions in Argentina and the signing of what was perceived to be a humiliating peace treaty brought down Rivadavia's presidency. Without any political backing or support from Buenos Aires. Alvear tendered his resignation and returned to Buenos Aires. When he arrived in the capital, he realized he had been removed by the new government, which did everything possible to discredit him and Rivadavia. =Alvear and Rosas= In 1829 Juan Manuel de Rosas appeared in the Argentine political scene, inaugurating a controversial regime that on and off would last almost 23 years. Alvear was one of the leaders of the opposition and, in 1832, Rosas appointed him ambassador to the United States, as a way of neutralizing his political ambitions. A change in government the following year allowed Alvear to remain in Buenos Aires. However, when Rosas returned to power in 1835, he again tried to get rid of Alvear, who he suspected was conspiring against his government. =Argentina's First Ambassador to the United States= In early 1837, after discovering evidence that linked Alvear to a new conspiracy, Rosas appointed him Argentina's first minister plenipotentiary to the United States. However, he was only able to depart the following year. Alvear spent the rest of his life as ambassador in the U.S. and died in his house in New York in November 1852. During his residence in the United States, Alvear had the opportunity to meet and interact with important political figures such as Joel Roberts Poinsett, Daniel Webster, John Calhoun and James Buchanan, among others. Alvear's instructions were mostly concerned with obtaining an apology from the United States regarding the conduct of an American warship at the Falkland Islands, and to reassert Argentine claims to those islands. The U.S. government was indifferent to the Argentine claims. Seeing that nothing more could be expected from Washington, Alvear requested to be transferred to Europe, but Rosas refused. As the conflict between Argentina and France, and later Britain, intensified, Alvear tried to get the support of the United States arguing that it would be consistent with the Monroe Doctrine. At the time, however, the United States was more concerned about the situation in Texas and Oregon, so remained neutral in this conflict. Although a political enemy of Rosas, Alvear admired him for his stance against France and England. Although he had been a lifelong admirer of the United States, after the annexation of Texas (1845) and the subsequent war with Mexico (1846‚Äì1848), Alvear became wary of American intentions towards Spanish America. According to his American biographer Thomas Davis, his diplomatic correspondence shaped Argentina's traditional distrust to U.S. policies, which Alvear felt included the desire to conquer, or at least dominate, all of Latin America. Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery in Buenos Aires. Legacy Bartolom√© Mitre, author of the biography of San Mart√≠n Historia de San Mart√≠n y de la emancipaci√≥n sudamericana, was very critical of Alvear, describing him as an ambitious and dictatorial. Most later historians reject Alvear as well, albeit for different reasons. Leftist authors support Monteagudo but reject Alvear, despite their political relation. Revisionist authors, supporters of anti-imperialism, condemn Alvear for the attempt to turn the United Provinces into a British protectorate and relate him with the party of Bernardino Rivadavia, despite them being enemies.Galasso, pp. 104-105 References Bibliography  Alvear, Carlos Maria de, El general Alvear a prop√≥sito de las memorias del general Iriarte, Emece Editores, Buenos Aires, 1986. * Carranza, √Ångel J., Biograf√≠a del General don Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Documento manuscrito, Colecci√≥n Alvear, AGN, Buenos Aires. * Comisi√≥n del Segundo Centenario del General Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Emece Editores, Buenos Aires, 1989. * Davis, Thomas B.: Carlos de Alvear, Man of Revolution.

Since 2001 the club has won twelve major trophies, including the Elite League Championship in 2003, 2004, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015 and SGB Premiership Champions in 2018. Poole Speedway is promoted by local businessman Matt Ford, who took over promoting rights of the club in 1998. The team is managed by past rider and former Great Britain team manager Neil Middleditch. Wimborne Road Stadium has been home to the club since it was founded in 1948. In August 2004, Poole hosted the Speedway World Cup final, which was won by Sweden. Stadium Poole Stadium (also known as Wimborne Road Stadium), has been the Pirates' home track since the club was created in 1948. It is situated near to the town centre and is owned by Poole Borough Council. The stadium's capacity was limited to 5,500 people in 2008 for safety reasons. Prior to 1948, the stadium had been used as a cycle track and had been home to Poole Town Football Club since 1933. There is an all seater grandstand on the home straight, and a glass fronted grandstand on the back straight. The viewing areas on the track bends are un-sheltered and standing only.Bamford, R & Jarvis J.(2001). Homes of British Speedway. Stroud: Tempus Publishing. At the start of 1948 the tarmac cycle track was dug up and replaced with a speedway track. A steel safety fence was erected around the outside of the track and the football pitch remained within the centre of the track. The first speedway meeting took place in the stadium on 26 April 1948, in tragic circumstances. The match against the Yarmouth Bloaters, which Poole won 74‚Äì32, saw Yarmouth's Reg Craven killed in the first race in the very first match at the track. A sheltered 1,100 seat grandstand was erected on the home straight in 1960 and is still in use. The terracing on the back straight of the speedway track was demolished in 1997 and replaced with a new glass fronted grandstand incorporating a 440 seat restaurant, two bars, Tote betting facilities and multiple viewing screens. The speedway track was reduced in size to to accommodate a new greyhound track. Stadia UK were issued a long term lease on the stadium by the council, with the Pirates promotion sub- leasing use of the stadium and facilities from Stadia UK. In 2004, Poole Stadium was chosen to host the Speedway World Cup final by organiser Benfield Sports International (BSI). Poole hosted the race-off on 5 August, in which Sweden and Poland progressed to the final. The final took place on 7 August with Sweden becoming World Champions, defeating Great Britain into second place by one point. Temporary stands were erected around the corners of the track to provide 2,200 extra seats. The official attendance figure at the stadium for the final was 7,131. History =Early success= In 1947, Bournemouth based Exeter Falcons riders Tommy Crutcher and Charlie Hayden created a consortium, which also included Crutcher's brother Jack and Herby Hayden, with the aim of opening a speedway club closer to their home. The consortium applied to Poole Borough Council in 1947 to stage speedway racing in the town and the council approved their request on 6 January 1948. The Pirates lined up for their inaugural season as members of the National League Division Three. Tony Lewis was signed in 1949 and Ken Middleditch signed from Hastings in 1950, and they formed an effective pairing for the Pirates. Poole won their first title in 1951 and were promoted to the National League Division Two. Brian Crutcher signed for Poole in 1951 and the following year he became the first Poole rider to reach a World Speedway Final in 1952. Poole won the Division Two title at the first attempt, but were denied First Division status by the Speedway Control Board, who claimed that Poole were not a big enough club to be able to sustain top flight racing. The following two years (1953 and 1954) saw the Pirates narrowly finishing as Division Two runners up and Brian Crutcher left Poole to sign for National League team Wembley at the start of the 1953 season. programmes from 1948 and 1962 on display at Poole Museum In 1955, the Pirates again won the Division Two Championship and were allowed promotion to Division One of the National League, becoming the only club to ever have won promotion from the bottom league to the top tier. However, by the end of the 1956 season, the Poole promoters closed the club, blaming poor attendances and the introduction of fuel rationing due to the Suez Crisis. Despite losing their league status, Poole Stadium continued to stage meetings during 1957, including two National League meetings. Rayleigh Rockets promoter Vic Gooden took over the promoting rights of Poole at the end of the year and Poole rejoined the National League in 1958. Southampton Saints promoter Charles Knott took over from Gooden in 1960 and brought back the successful pairing of Middleditch and Lewis. Ross Gilbertson was also signed and Geoff Mudge was brought over from Australia. The stadium was redeveloped and the track was made slightly smaller to accommodate a greyhound racing track. Also that year, the speedway league structure was re-formed and Poole opted to join the newly formed Provincial League. Poole finished joint top of the table with Rayleigh, but lost out on points difference. Success returned to Poole with the Provincial League title in 1961 and 1962. =British League= Following a power struggle between the Speedway Control Board and speedway club promoters, the British League was formed in 1965. Poole joined the British League (the top league Division) with 18 other teams and remained there for the next 20 years. They won the British League title in 1969 with Pete Smith, who would eventually go on to score over 3,287 points for the club, the biggest contributor. Smith was supported with contributions from team captain Geoff Mudge, Bruce Cribb, Gordon Guasco, Frank Shuter and Odd Fossengen who was in his second year at Poole and would become a fans favourite. Major changes in personnel took place in 1974, with the arrival of riders such as Colin Gooddy and Neil Middleditch, son of former rider Ken Middleditch. In 1975, Poole completed the signing of Malcolm Simmons from King's Lynn. Simmons finished top of the Poole riders averages for the next six seasons and in 1976 finished in second place at the Speedway World Championship. Mid-way through the 1979 season, Reg Fearman bought the promoting rights and continued to run the club until 1984 when financial problems forced the club to close. The club was rescued by the then Weymouth Wildcats promoters Peter Ansell and Mervyn Stewkesbury, who moved their team to Poole for the start of the 1985 season. The team name was changed to the Poole Wildcats and they entered the National League ‚Äì the second league tier of speedway. The name change proved to be unpopular and was reverted to the Poole Pirates after two seasons. Australian manager Neil Street was appointed as Poole team manager and an influx of young Australian riders began, including Craig Boyce and Leigh Adams in 1988. Poole finished as National League runners up 1988, were National League champions in 1989, and then won a League and Knockout Cup double in 1990, led by captain Alun Rossiter. After the 1990 season, the leagues were re-structured and Poole re-joined the top flight of speedway ‚Äì the British League. Poole won the league championship in 1994 led by Boyce, 1993 signing Lars Gunnestad and a young Jason Crump, grandson of manager Neil Street. In 1997 the structure of the leagues was once again changed with Poole joining the Elite League. =First Division= Coventry during an Elite League meeting in July 2008. Poole initially struggled in the Elite League and were sold to local businessmen Matt Ford and Mike Golding in 1998. In a clear out at the club, only Magnus Zetterstrom remained from the 1998 season and Neil Street was replaced as manager by former rider Neil Middleditch. Craig Boyce left for Oxford, Lee Richardson was signed from Reading, Gary Havelock was brought in as Captain and Mark Loram was signed from Wolverhampton. Loram was to become the first Pirate to lift the World Championship title with his success in 2000. Poole finished as Elite League runners up in 1999 and 2001. Tony Rickardsson joined Poole in 2001 and won the World Championship that year and the year after. Leigh Adams joined in 2003 and together they spearheaded the team to a triple championship of Elite League, Knockout Cup and the British League Cup. The Pirates followed up 2003 with another successful year in 2004 despite the loss of Grand Prix riders Adams and Rickardsson. Solid point scoring from Bjarne Pedersen, Antonio Lindback and Ryan Sullivan led Poole to an Elite League and Knockout Cup double and Poole became the first top flight club to achieve back to back League and Cup doubles since 1960. The Pirates won their third Elite League championship in 2008, defeating the Lakeside Hammers in the play-off final with an aggregate score of 108‚Äì75. in 2011 the Poole pirates dominated the league, spearheaded by Chris Holder and Darcy Ward, and finished the season off by defeating the Eastbourne Eagles in the play-off final. 2014 ended perfectly for the Pirates as they managed to overcome Coventry in the Grand Final over 2 legs with Maciej Janowski winning the decisive heat to seal the title. The team included a mixture of world-class riders, upcoming riders, and good long-term assets. For example, the 2014 Poole Pirates team included Chris Holder, Maciej Janowski, Josh Grajczonek, V√°clav Mil√≠k, Jr., Przemyslaw Pawlicki, Kyle Newman, and Lee Smart. The 2016 team included Australians Brady Kurtz and Chris Holder, along with Adam Ellis, Hans Andersen, Krzysztof Buczkowski, Kyle Newman, and Davey Watt. Bournemouth Buccaneers Poole operated an additional team, Bournemouth Buccaneers, in the National League in 2009 and 2010. Despite successful seasons on track, spectator support was disappointing and the operation was terminated. The 2010 team included Jay Herne, Kyle Newman, Jerran Hart, Luke Priest, Mark Baseby, Aaron Baseby, and Andrew Aldridge. = Second Division: 2020-Present = Poole are riding in the second division, called the SGB Championship, in 2020. World Champions Mark Loram was the first Poole rider to win the Speedway World Championship with his success in 2000. Tony Rickardsson joined Poole in 2001 following Loram's departure to Peterborough, and won the World Championship in 2001 and 2002 while riding for the Pirates. Chris Holder is the latest World Champion to ride for the Pirates securing his first Speedway Grand Prix title in October 2012. Malcolm Simmons won the World Pairs Championship for England three times during his Poole career in 1976, 1977 and 1978, he also won the World Team Cup in 1975 and 1977. Antonio Lindb√§ck won the Speedway World Cup in for Sweden 2004, and Denmark's Bjarne Pedersen has won the World Cup on two occasions; in 2006 and 2008. Australian Jason Crump was the first Pirate to win the Speedway World Under 21 Championship in 1995. England's Lee Richardson (1999), Poland's Krzysztof Kasprzak (2005) and Australian Darcy Ward (2010) have also won the World Under 21 Championship while riding for Poole.

Drawings of what looks to be hockey have been found in an Egyptian tomb that was 4000 years old. Hockey is a popular game in India and Pakistan. It was played for hundreds of years before other countries like England modernised it. Hockey is similar to an ancient game played in Scotland called shinty. Hockey is often played at schools in the UK but its origins are unclear. Later came ice hockey, which developed in Canada. Games similar to hockey outside the West In Inner Mongolia, China, the Daur people have been playing Beikou (a game similar to modern field hockey) for about 1,000 years. European settlers in Chile in the 16th century described a hockey-like game of the Araucano Indians called chueca (or 'the twisted one' from the twisted end of the stick used by players). In Western Australia, early white settlers witnessed Noongar people played a game called dumbung, in which bent sticks were used to hit a ball made of dried sap from the native peartree. (The game is believed to be the source of the name of Dumbleyung, a town near where it was played.) In Punjab (India) people used to play a hockey like game in old times known as ‚ÄúKhido khundi‚Äù. Here khido stands for ball and khundi means Hockey. Modern hockey A game called hockey was played in English public schools in the early 19th century. Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in England, except at schools.... Hockey's popularity increased with that of other team games. A version of the game played in south-east London was rougher than the modern version, played on a very large field (247m by 64m), and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks. The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs, especially Teddington Hockey Club. The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise, but did not particularly care for football. In 1870, members of the Teddington cricket club, who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park, were looking for a winter activity. They experimented with a ‚Äòstick‚Äô game, based loosely on the rules of association football. Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball, so allowing smooth and predictable motion. By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game, including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it. An association was formed in 1875, which dissolved after seven years, but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge. Blackheath were one of the founder members, but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union. The Union failed, but the Association grew rapidly. They rejected a form of the game that involved a 7oz (200g) rubber cube, catching, marking and scrimmaging, based on rugby football, at the time favoured by the Blackheath club. The Teddington club chose to limit the number per side to eleven, and preferred to play with old cricket balls. They also introduced the idea of the striking circle (‚Äòthe dee‚Äô or 'D'), and they played several games in Bushy Park, in the winter of 1871. Clubs were also set up in Richmond and Surbiton in 1874, and inter-club matches were played between them and Teddington. The game grew sporadically, as the clubs did not always agree on the rules! In the late 19th century, largely due to the British Army, the game spread throughout the British Empire, leading to the first international competition in 1895 (Ireland 3, Wales 0). The International Rules Board was founded in 1895, and hockey first appeared at the Olympic Games as a men's competition at 1908 Olympic Games in London, with only three teams: England, Ireland and Scotland. Men's hockey became a permanent fixture at the Olympics at the 1928 Olympic Games, at Amsterdam. The first step towards an international structuring occurred in 1909, when England and Belgium agreed to recognize each other for international competitions, soon joined in by the French federation. In 1924, the International Hockey Federation (FIH, F√©d√©ration Internationale de Hockey) was founded in Paris, under the initiative of the French man, Paul L√©autey, as a response to hockey's omission from the 1924 Paris Games. The founding members were Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Hungary, Spain, and Switzerland. The development of the FIH owes a lot to the work of R√©n√© George Frank, a Belgian, in the years after the Second World War until the 1970s. Men's hockey united under the FIH in 1970, when the Hockey Association joined and the International Rules Board became part of the FIH's structure. The game had been taken to India by British servicemen, and the first clubs formed there in Calcutta in 1885. The Beighton Cup and the Aga Khan tournament had commenced within ten years. Entering the Olympic Games in 1928, India won all five of its games without conceding a goal, and went on to win in 1932 until 1956, and then in 1964 and 1980. Pakistan won in 1960, 1968, and 1984. Women's hockey Women's hockey developed separately from men's hockey. Women do not seem to have played hockey widely before the modern era. Women's hockey was first played at British Universities and schools, and the first club, Molesey Ladies Hockey Club, was founded in 1887. The first national association was the Irish Ladies Hockey Union in 1894, and though rebuffed by the Hockey Association, women's hockey grew rapidly around the world. This led to the formation of the International Federation of Women's Hockey Associations (IFWHA) in 1927, though this did not include initially many continental European countries where women played as sections of men's associations and were affiliated to the FIH. The IFWHA held conferences every three years, and the tournaments associated with these were the primary IFWHA competitions. These tournaments were non-competitive until 1975. By the early 1970s there were 22 associations with women's sections in the FIH and 36 associations in the IFWHA. Discussions were started about a common rule book. The FIH introduced competitive tournaments in 1974, forcing the acceptance of the principle of competitive hockey by the IFWHA in 1973. It took until 1982 for the two bodies to merge, but this allowed the introduction of women's hockey to the 1980 Olympic Games, where, as in the men's game, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands have been consistently strong. The synthetic revolution Grass Playing Surface Synthetic turf at Anna Stadium, Trichy In the early 1970s, the \\"synthetic grass\\" fields began to be used for hockey, with the first Olympic Games on this surface being held at the 1976 Montreal edition. Synthetic pitches are now mandatory for all international tournaments and most national competitions. While hockey is still played on grass fields at some local levels and lesser national divisions, it has been replaced by synthetic turf almost everywhere in the western world. The introduction of artificial surfaces has changed the game. In order to take into account the specificities of this surface, new tactics and new techniques (such as the Indian dribble) have been developed and new rules have been introduced in order to control these new techniques. Regarding the evolution of the hockey player material, the sticks have changed shape, with the bent head at the bottom, which used to be about 15 centimetres long, becoming much stubbier. The extra length was no longer necessary, as the ball travelled much straighter on the flatter synthetic fields. The shorter length made playing the ball with the \\"backhand\\" (playing with the head of the stick to the player's left, with the head rotated 180 degrees from its usual position) much easier, increasing the speed with which this tactic, often used for evasive manoeuvres, could be used. It also makes trapping the ball by placing the entire stick on the ground, with the point of the head resting on the ground to the player's left, possible, and this stopping technique is now universal for trapping the ball at penalty corners. The sticks have also tended to become stiffer as to hit the ball harder. Fibreglass, carbon fibre and kevlar were first applied to the traditional wood core in the early 1970s. Sticks with an aluminium core have been produced but are now prohibited due to the danger they pose when broken. Wooden sticks are less and less common, and players are now playing with sticks entirely made of synthetic composite materials. The goalkeeper equipment has followed the same trend, becoming more and more able to resist to strength of the balls hit by these new generation sticks. Helmets have become compulsory, padding is thicker and of more shock- absorbing (and reflecting) foam material and more areas of the body are padded. The new equipment is very expensive and is often a considerable burden for clubs or individual goalkeepers to purchase. The composition of the hockey ball has also changed, from a leather ball with a seam similar to a cricket ball, to a seamless, usually dimpled hard plastic ball. These plastic balls are cheaper, more durable, more consistent in their behaviour, and are unaffected by water; a key requirement in water-moderated synthetic fields used in elite-level hockey. Ancillary player equipment has also changed. The studded boots for grass fields are banned (and were in any case very uncomfortable) on synthetics, and have been replaced with boots specifically designed for synthetic turf. Shin guards have improved padding. Many players have taken to wearing padded gloves, particularly on their left hand, both to protect against contact and allow them to scrape that hand (while holding the stick) across the synthetic turf without injury. Finally, the wearing of mouthguards to protect the teeth is now compulsory for safety in many countries.  Rules  The rules of the game have widely changed. The main issues have been * To adapt the game to the new synthetic fields introduced in the 1980s. * To enhance comprehension from non-players in order to gain TV coverage Some of these rules changes: * The FIH eliminated the offside rule (similar to offside in football) in the mid-1990s in order to increase scoring opportunities. * Constant modifications of the penalty corner rules in order to minimize its importance in the game and its readability. * Limitation of the bow of sticks in order to limit the increasing use and power of drag flicks.

Increasingly, but not entirely, they are based on a digital processor (or computer). They generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and sensors. Some data loggers interface with a personal computer, and use software to activate the data logger and view and analyze the collected data, while others have a local interface device (keypad, LCD) and can be used as a stand-alone device. Data loggers vary between general purpose types for a range of measurement applications to very specific devices for measuring in one environment or application type only. It is common for general purpose types to be programmable; however, many remain as static machines with only a limited number or no changeable parameters. Electronic data loggers have replaced chart recorders in many applications. One of the primary benefits of using data loggers is the ability to automatically collect data on a 24-hour basis. Upon activation, data loggers are typically deployed and left unattended to measure and record information for the duration of the monitoring period. This allows for a comprehensive, accurate picture of the environmental conditions being monitored, such as air temperature and relative humidity. The cost of data loggers has been declining over the years as technology improves and costs are reduced. Simple single channel data loggers cost as little as $25. More complicated loggers may costs hundreds or thousands of dollars.  Data formats  Standardisation of protocols and data formats has been a problem but is now growing in the industry and XML, JSON, and YAML are increasingly being adopted for data exchange. The development of the Semantic Web and the Internet of Things is likely to accelerate this present trend.  Instrumentation protocols  Several protocols have been standardised including a smart protocol, SDI-12, that allows some instrumentation to be connected to a variety of data loggers. The use of this standard has not gained much acceptance outside the environmental industry. SDI-12 also supports multi drop instruments. Some datalogging companies are also now supporting the MODBUS standard. This has been used traditionally in the industrial control area, and there are many industrial instruments which support this communication standard. Another multi drop protocol which is now starting to become more widely used is based upon CAN Bus (ISO 11898). Some data loggers use a flexible scripting environment to adapt themselves to various non-standard protocols. Data logging versus data acquisition The terms data logging and data acquisition are often used interchangeably. However, in a historical context they are quite different. A data logger is a data acquisition system, but a data acquisition system is not necessarily a data logger. *Data loggers typically have slower sample rates. A maximum sample rate of 1 Hz may be considered to be very fast for a data logger, yet very slow for a typical data acquisition system. *Data loggers are implicitly stand-alone devices, while typical data acquisition system must remain tethered to a computer to acquire data. This stand-alone aspect of data loggers implies on-board memory that is used to store acquired data. Sometimes this memory is very large to accommodate many days, or even months, of unattended recording. This memory may be battery-backed static random access memory, flash memory or EEPROM. Earlier data loggers used magnetic tape, punched paper tape, or directly viewable records such as \\"strip chart recorders\\". *Given the extended recording times of data loggers, they typically feature a mechanism to record the date and time in a timestamp to ensure that each recorded data value is associated with a date and time of acquisition in order to produce a sequence of events. As such, data loggers typically employ built-in real-time clocks whose published drift can be an important consideration when choosing between data loggers. *Data loggers range from simple single-channel input to complex multi-channel instruments. Typically, the simpler the device the less programming flexibility. Some more sophisticated instruments allow for cross-channel computations and alarms based on predetermined conditions. The newest of data loggers can serve web pages, allowing numerous people to monitor a system remotely. *The unattended and remote nature of many data logger applications implies the need in some applications to operate from a DC power source, such as a battery. Solar power may be used to supplement these power sources. These constraints have generally led to ensure that the devices they market are extremely power efficient relative to computers. In many cases they are required to operate in harsh environmental conditions where computers will not function reliably. *This unattended nature also dictates that data loggers must be extremely reliable. Since they may operate for long periods nonstop with little or no human supervision, and may be installed in harsh or remote locations, it is imperative that so long as they have power, they will not fail to log data for any reason. Manufacturers go to great length to ensure that the devices can be depended on in these applications. As such dataloggers are almost completely immune to the problems that might affect a general-purpose computer in the same application, such as program crashes and the instability of some operating systems. Applications LIPI Applications of data logging include: * Unattended weather station recording (such as wind speed / direction, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation). * Unattended hydrographic recording (such as water level, water depth, water flow, water pH, water conductivity). * Unattended soil moisture level recording. * Unattended gas pressure recording. * Offshore buoys for recording a variety of environmental conditions. * Road traffic counting. * Measure temperatures (humidity, etc.) of perishables during shipments: Cold chain. * Measure variations in light intensity. * Measuring temperature of pharmaceutical products, medicines and vaccines during storage * Measuring temperature and humidity of perishable products during transportation to ensure cold chain is maintained * Process monitoring for maintenance and troubleshooting applications. * Process monitoring to verify warranty conditions * Wildlife research with pop-up archival tags * Measure vibration and handling shock (drop height) environment of distribution packaging. * Tank level monitoring. * Deformation monitoring of any object with geodetic or geotechnical sensors controlled by an automatic deformation monitoring system. * Environmental monitoring. * Vehicle testing (including crash testing) * Motor racing * Monitoring of relay status in railway signalling. * For science education enabling 'measurement', 'scientific investigation' and an appreciation of 'change' * Record trend data at regular intervals in veterinary vital signs monitoring. * Load profile recording for energy consumption management. * Temperature, humidity and power use for heating and air conditioning efficiency studies. * Water level monitoring for groundwater studies. * Digital electronic bus sniffer for debug and validation =Examples= * Black-box (stimulus/response) loggers: ** A flight data recorder (FDR) is a piece of recording equipment used to collect specific aircraft performance data. The term may also be used, albeit less accurately, to describe the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), another type of data recording device found on board aircraft. ** An event data recorder (EDR) is a device installed by the manufacturer in some automobiles which collects and stores various data during the time-frame immediately before and after a crash. ** A voyage data recorder (VDR) is a data recording system designed to collect data from various sensors on board a ship. ** A train event recorder is a device that records data about the operation of train controls and performance in response to those controls and other train control systems. ** An accident data recorder (ADR) is a device for triggering accidents or incidents in most kind of land vehicles and recording the relevant data. In automobiles, all diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) are logged in engine control units (ECUs) so that at the time of service of a vehicle, a service engineer will read all the DTCs using Tech-2 or similar tools connected to the on-board diagnostics port, and will come to know problems occurred in the vehicle. Sometimes a small OBD data logger is plugged into the same port to continuously record vehicle data. ** In embedded system and digital electronics design, specialized high-speed digital data logger help overcome the limitations of more traditional instruments such as the oscilloscope and the logic analyzer. The main advantage of a data logger is its ability to record very long traces, which proves very useful when trying to correct functional bugs that happen once in while. ** In the racing industry, Data Loggers are used to record data such as braking points, lap/sector timing, and track maps, as well as any on-board vehicle sensors. * Health data loggers: ** The growing, preparation, storage and transportation of food.

The original model of a stand-alone data logger is changing to one of a device that collects data but also has access to wireless communications for alarming of events, automatic reporting of data and remote control. Data loggers are beginning to serve web pages for current readings, e-mail their alarms and FTP their daily results into databases or direct to the users. Very recently, there is a trend to move away from proprietary products with commercial software to open source software and hardware devices. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer is among others a popular platform hosting real-time Linux or preemptive-kernel Linux operating systems with many * digital interfaces like I2C, SPI or UART enabling the direct interconnection of a digital sensor and a computer, * and unlimited number of configurations to show measurements in real-time over the internet, process data, plot charts and diagrams...

It was fought between the South African Republic and the Orange Free State on the one hand and British forces during the Second Boer War campaign to relieve Ladysmith. It resulted in a Boer victory. The battle, collectively with its location at a hill, has gone down in British football lore as the namesake of a common British term for single-tier terraces and/or stands at football stadia. Prelude =Planning and crossing the Tugela= General Sir Redvers Buller, VC, commander of the British forces in Natal, was attempting to relieve a British force besieged in Ladysmith. The Boers under General Louis Botha held the Tugela River against him. Although Botha's men were outnumbered, they were mostly equipped with modern Mauser rifles and up- to-date field guns, and had carefully entrenched their positions. In late December, 1899, Buller made a frontal assault on the Boer positions at the Battle of Colenso. The result was a heavy British defeat.Dupuy, p. 854 Over the next few weeks, Buller received further reinforcements, and also acquired sufficient carts and transport to operate away from the railway line which was his main supply line. Buller devised a new plan of attack to relieve Ladysmith. His army was to launch a two-pronged offensive designed to cross the Tugela River at two points and create a bridgehead.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, p. 281‚Äì283 They would then attack the defensive line that blocked Buller's advance to Ladysmith. The area was only from Ladysmith. Buller delegated control of his main force to General Sir Charles Warren, to cross at Trichardt's Drift. Buller would then send a second smaller force, under Major General Neville Lyttelton to attack east of Warren's force as a diversion at Potgieter's Drift. Once across the Tugela the British would attack the Boer defensive positions and then cross the open plains to relieve Ladysmith.General Buller's despatches Warren's force numbered 11,000 infantry, 2,200 cavalry, and 36 field guns.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, p. 282 On the 11th they marched westward to cross the Little Tugela and take up position in front of Potgieter's Ferry.Churchill, \\"London to Ladysmith via Pretoria\\", Chapter XV However their march was easily visible to the Boers, and so slow (due in part to the massive baggage trains necessary to British officers at the time ‚Äì Warren's included a cast iron bathroom and well-equipped kitchen) that by the time they arrived at the Tugela, the Boers had entrenched a new position covering it. On the 18th British mounted troops under the Earl of Dundonald enterprisingly reached the extreme Boer right flank, from where there was little to stop them riding to Ladysmith, but Warren recalled them to guard the force's baggage.Kruger, p. 183 Once all his force had crossed the river, Warren sent part of an infantry division under Lieutenant General Francis Clery against the Boer right flank positions on a plateau named Tabanyama. The Boers had once again entrenched a new position on the reverse slopes of the plateau, and Clery's attack made no progress. Meanwhile, the secondary British attack by Lyttelton at Potgieter's Drift had yet to commence in full.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, p. 284 Battle Spion Kop, just northeast of Warren's force, was the largest hill in the region, being over in height (relative height from its base). It lay almost exactly at the centre of the Boer line. If the British could capture this position and bring artillery to the hill then they would command the flanks of the surrounding Boer positions. On the night of 23 January, Warren sent the larger part of his force under Major General Edward Woodgate to secure Spion Kop. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Thorneycroft was selected to lead the initial assault. (Thorneycroft was one of six \\"special service\\" officers, among whom were also Robert Baden-Powell and Herbert Plumer, despatched to South Africa shortly before the war to recruit local irregular corps. Thorneycroft's mounted infantry were raised in Natal and numbered 360.) The British climbed up the hill at night and in dense mist.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, p. 286 They surprised the small Boer piquet and drove them off the kop at bayonet point. Of the 15 men in the Boer piquet, one was mortally wounded and his grave lies on the hill to this day.E. Woodgate (letter to C.Warren, 24 January 1900) from Uncovered Editions. Ten British soldiers were wounded in the charge. The surviving Boers retreated down the hill to their camp waking up their fellow Boers by screaming \\"Die Engelse is op die kop!\\" (The English are on the hill!). A half-company of British sappers began to entrench the position with a mere 20 picks and 20 shovels (while almost 1,000 soldiers stood around idle) and Woodgate notified Warren of the successful capture of the hilltop.Thomas Pakenham, The Boer War, p. 288 A sketch of the summits of Spion Kop As dawn broke, the British discovered that they held only the smaller and lower part of the hilltop of Spion Kop, while the Boers occupied higher ground on three sides of the British position. The British had no direct knowledge of the topography of the summit and the darkness and fog had compounded the problem. Furthermore, the British trenches were inadequate for all defensive purposes. Because the summit of the kop was mostly hard rock, the trenches were at most deep and provided an exceptionally poor defensive position ‚Äì the British infantry in the trenches could not see over the crest of the plateau and the Boers were able to fire down the length of the crescent-shaped trench from the adjacent peaks. The Boer generals were not unduly concerned by the news that the British had taken the kop. They knew that their artillery on Tabanyama could be brought to bear on the British position and that rifle fire could be brought to bear from parts of the kop not yet occupied by the British. However, the Boer generals also knew that sniping and artillery alone would not be sufficient to dislodge the British ‚Äì and the Boer position was desperately vulnerable. If the British immediately established positions on Conical Hill and Aloe Knoll (the two unoccupied kopjes on the kop itself) they could bring their artillery to bear on Tabanyama, threatening the key Boer positions there. More importantly, there was a risk that the British would storm Trinity Peaks (Drielingkoppe) to the eastern end of Spion Kop. If Twin Peaks fell, the British would be able to turn the Boers' left flank and annihilate the main Boer encampment. The Boer generals realised that Spion Kop would have to be stormed quickly if certain defeat were to be averted. The Boer artillery began to bombard the British position, dropping shells from the adjacent plateau of Tabanyama at a rate of ten rounds per minute. Meanwhile, Commandant Hendrik Prinsloo of the Carolina Commando captured Aloe Knoll and Conical Hill with some 88 men, while around 300 burghers, mainly of the Pretoria Commando, climbed the kop to launch a frontal assault on the British position. Prinsloo told his men: \\"Burghers, we're now going in to attack the enemy and we shan't all be coming back. Do your duty and trust in the Lord.\\"Pakenham, p 303 Minutes later, hundreds of Boers swarmed in to attack the British positions at the Spion Kop crestline, much to the surprise of the British. It was very unusual for the Boers to launch a daytime massed attack quickly resulting in vicious, close-quarters combat. This was not a custom of the Boers' style of warfare. The British Lee‚ÄìMetford and Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles were no less deadly than the Boer Mauser rifles. However, both sides exchanged fire at close range and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, with the British wielding fixed bayonets and the Boers wielding hunting knives and their own rifles used as bludgeons. After suffering serious losses, the Boer assault carried the crest line after several minutes of brutal hand-to-hand combat, but could advance no further. Over the next several hours, a kind of stalemate now settled over the kop. The Boers had failed to drive the British completely off the kop, but the surviving men of the Pretoria and Carolina commando now held a firing line on Aloe Knoll from where they could enfilade the British position and the British were now under sustained bombardment from the Boer artillery. The British had failed to exploit their initial success, and the initiative now passed to the Boers. Battle of Spion Kop map Morale began to sag on both sides as the extreme heat, exhaustion and thirst took hold. On one hand the Boers on the kop could see large numbers of burghers on the plains below them who refused to join the fight. A sense of betrayal, the bloody failure of the frontal assault, the indiscipline inherent in a civilian army and the apparent security of the British position proved too much for some Boers, who began to abandon their hard-won positions. On the other hand, the bombardment began to take its toll on the British. Woodgate fell at about 08:30, mortally wounded by a shell splinter. In quick succession, Colonel Blomfield of the Lancashire Fusiliers took command but was wounded soon after Woodgate's death, while the sappers' officer, Major H.H.Massy, and Woodgate's brigade major, Captain N.H. Vertue, were killed.Pakenham, p 307 Officers and men from different units were intermingled, and the British were now leaderless, confused and pinned down by the heavy Boer artillery and rifle fire. The British artillery, positioned lower down the slopes of Spion Kop, were unable to hit back at the Boer guns. The British artillery was also missing their marks causing one soldier to remark in his diary of the events \\"our gunners, by the inaccuracy of their fire did far more damage to our front line of infantry than to the Boers!\\" Colonel Malby Crofton of the Royal Lancasters took charge and semaphored a plea for help, \\"Reinforce at once or all is lost. General dead.\\"Pakenham, p 308-309 After that the stunned colonel failed to exercise any leadership. Thorneycroft seems to have taken charge, leading a spirited counterattack that failed in the face of withering fire. Warren had already dispatched Major General John Talbot Coke's brigade of two regular battalions and the Imperial Light Infantry (raised in Durban) to reinforce the summit. However, he refused to launch an attack on Tabanyama and barred his guns from firing on Aloe Knoll, believing this to be part of the British position. At 11:40, Buller, who could see that things were not going well, suggested to Warren that Thorneycroft be appointed commander on the kop. The first runner to Thorneycroft was shot dead before he could utter a word. Finally, a second runner brought the news, \\"You are a general.\\"Pakenham, p. 312 2008 view of Spion Kop Winston Churchill was a journalist stationed in South Africa and he had also been commissioned as a lieutenant in the South African Light Horse by General Buller after his well-publicised escape from Boer captivity. Churchill acted as a courier to and from Spion Kop and Buller's headquarters and made a statement about the scene: \\"Corpses lay here and there. Many of the wounds were of a horrible nature. The splinters and fragments of the shells had torn and mutilated them. The shallow trenches were choked with dead and wounded.\\" About 13:00, the situation proved too much for some men of the Lancashire Fusiliers who attempted to surrender. Thorneycroft personally intervened and shouted at the Boers who advanced to round up prisoners, \\"I'm the commandant here; take your men back to hell sir. I allow no surrenders.\\" Luckily for Thorneycroft, the first of the British reinforcements arrived at this moment. A vicious point-blank firefight ensued but the British line had been saved. At 14:30, Thorneycroft sent Warren a plea for reinforcements and water. Meanwhile, Coke never reached the summit. He saw Thorneycroft's message for help but then did nothing to assure the lieutenant colonel of his nearby presence or support. The Middlesex Regiment and the Imperial Light Infantry, under Colonel Augustus Hill, who was senior to Thorneycroft in the army list and who also believed he was overall commander on the kop, held the British right for two and a half hours until a second crisis occurred when they too began to give way. The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) arrived at this point, and drove the Boers back with a bayonet charge. The fighting on the British right now became a stalemate.Kruger, Goodbye Dolly Grey, pp.193‚Äì194 In the morning, Warren had asked for reinforcements from Lyttelton's division, even though he had eleven battalions of his own to draw upon. Without asking Buller, Lyttelton sent two battalions toward Spion Kop. One battalion, the King's Royal Rifle Corps, turned aside to attack Twin Peaks. After losing Lieutenant Colonel Riddell killed and 100 other casualties, the rifles cracked the thin Boer line and carried the double summit at 17:00. Aftermath Shattered by the loss of Twin Peaks, General Schalk Willem Burger took his commando out of the battle line that night. On Spion Kop, the Boers who had fought bravely since morning abandoned their positions as darkness fell. They were about to retreat, when Botha appeared and persuaded them to stay. The Boers, however, did not reclaim their positions, and unknown to Thorneycroft, the battle was as good as won. But Thorneycroft's nerve was also shattered. After sixteen hours on the kop doing the job of a brigadier general in total absence of instructions from Warren, he ordered an unauthorised withdrawal from Spion Kop after reporting that the soldiers had no water and ammunition was running short. His reasons for withdrawing were that without artillery support to counter the heavy Boer artillery fire, there was no possibility of defending the position and the extreme difficulty of digging trenches on the summit of Spion Kop left the British soldiers completely exposed. Churchill appeared on the scene for the second time. This time he brought the first orders from Warren since he elevated Thorneycroft to brigadier. Churchill said 1,400 men were on the way with two large naval guns. Thorneycroft told him, \\"better six good battalions safely down the hill than a bloody mop-up in the morning.\\"Pakenham, p 319 He ordered the brigade to retreat. At the same time, Buller sent Lyttelton strict orders to recall his troops from Twin Peaks. When morning came, the Boer generals were astonished to see two burghers on the top of Spion Kop, waving their slouch-hats in triumph. The only British on the kop were the dead and the dying. The British suffered 243 fatalities during the battle; many were buried in the trenches where they fell. Approximately 1,250 British were either wounded or captured. Mohandas Gandhi was a stretcher-bearer at the battle, in the Indian Ambulance Corps he had organised, and was decorated. The Boers suffered 335 casualties of which 68 were dead, including Commandant Prinsloo's commando casualties of 55 killed and wounded out of 88 men. The British retreated back over the Tugela, but the Boers were too exhausted to pursue and follow up their success. Once across the river, Buller managed to rally his troops. Ladysmith would be relieved by the British four weeks later. Reaction and legacy The battle was the background for Louwrens Penning's best known novel De held van Spionkop (1901, The Hero of Spionkop). Penning's story concerns the very real Commandant Louis Wessels,George McCall Theal History of South Africa Since September 1795 1108023665-- 2010 p 206 \\"The camp of Commandant Louis Wessels was at this time at Berea. Molapo had requested that he might be permitted to communicate with his father, and General Fick agreed to send his messengers to the camp at Berea at the same time that ...\\"Michael G.

The main character is the Boer Louis Wessels, who flits in and out of the novel like some superman. \\" Commentary Buller erred in appointing Warren an independent commander, despite his own doubts about his subordinate's capacity. On the evening of the battle, Warren only ordered up reinforcements in men and heavy guns at the late hour of 21:00. Medical assistance, water and ammunition were also tardy in arriving. > Still, perhaps it was not Warren's failure to remedy these deficiencies that > proved his worst error. It was his failure to tell Thorneycroft of his plans > to do so. Astonishing as it may seem, he had sent no direct instructions to > Thorneycroft since the heliogram appointing him a general at midday. He had > left it to Coke to reassure Thorneycroft, although (by another astonishing > blunder) Warren had never actually told Coke that he had put Thorneycroft in > charge. Then, to compound all these blunders, at 9:00 pm Warren had ordered > Coke to return to the HQ for consultation, leaving Thorneycroft alone among > the horrors on the summit.Pakenham, p 318  Note about the name  The common English name for the battle is \\"Spion Kop\\" throughout the Commonwealth and its historical literature, the official South African English and Afrikaans name for the battle is \\"Spioenkop\\": spioen means \\"spy\\" or \\"look-out\\", and kop means \\"hill\\" or \\"outcropping\\". Another variant that is sometimes found is the combination into \\"Spionkop\\". The reason why the older spelling is used internationally is because the name \\"Spionkop\\" originates from Dutch; spion [spee-yawn], and not spioen [spee-yoon], is the Dutch word for \\"spy\\". Until the 1920s, Dutch was still the official written language of the Boers, which is why the older Dutch spelling persists outside South Africa. Within South Africa, the spelling was updated along with Afrikaans spelling reform and recognition of Afrikaans as a language in its own right.  Legacy of the name  This photo shows a section of the British graves at the site of the Battle of Spioenkop. Many of the fallen soldiers were buried in the trenches where they died. These graves therefore give an indication of where the trenches were located at the time of the battle. * Many football grounds in England in the Premier League and Football League have one terrace or stand in their stadia named \\"Kop\\" or \\"Spion Kop\\" because of the steep nature of the terracing. For a history and list of these, see Spion Kop (stadia). * Liverpool FC have a stand named The KOP. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, named it the Spion Kop to honor those who died. More than 300 British soldiers had died, many of them from Liverpool. * The village of Spion Kop near Mansfield, Nottinghamshire was named after the battle. * A hill outside Rugeley, Staffordshire part of Cannock Chase AONB, SSSI is called Spion Kop, in memory of the battle. * A hill outside Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys is called Spion Kop, in memory of the battle. * The 18th hole at The Otago Golf Club, Dunedin, New Zealand oldest golf club in the southern hemisphere, is called Spion Kop. * Daleview cottages, in the village of Ballybrack, in Co.

He is not mentioned outside the Bƒìowulf manuscript, and it is not known whether he was based on a real person. He belonged to a probably Swedish family (an √§tt, see Norse clans) called the Waegmundings. He married the daughter of Hre√∞el, king of the Geats, and was the father of Bƒìowulf. His name could be read as eƒãƒ° + √æƒìow, \\"edge-servant\\" (that is, sword-thane); alternatively, if his name was a compound of the ancient bahuvrihi type as were many other Germanic heroic names, it would indicate proficiency with the sword, meaning literally, \\"whose servant is the sword\\". He is first mentioned in Bƒìowulf at lines 262‚Äì266, when Beowulf tells the coast-guardian that \\"My father was known to everyone,\\" calls him a \\"noble battle-leader\\", and says that he died after living through \\"many winters\\" and that he is remembered well by wise men everywhere. At lines 372‚Äì375, Hr≈ç√∞gƒÅr, the Danish king, recalls Ecg√æeow, remembering that he married King Hre√∞el's only daughter. At lines 456‚Äì472, Hr≈ç√∞gƒÅr recalls the story of how Ecg√æƒìow once came to him for help: he had slain Hea√∞olaf, a man from another tribe called the Wulfings (probably the rulers of the East Geats). One of the Germanic ways of resolving a blood feud was either to pay a wergild (Anglo-Saxon, \\"man- price\\") or to be banished. Either Ecg√æƒìow's people could not pay a wergild, or the Wulfings refused to accept it from them; so Ecg√æeow had to leave home. He went to Dane-Land; Hr≈ç√∞gƒÅr paid the wergild, and Ecg√æeow swore oaths of friendship to him. The Wulfings were probably the same as the Wylfings mentioned in Widsith,Howell D. Chickering, Beowulf: a Dual-Language Edition, Doubleday, New York, NY, 1977. and according to Widsith one of their lords was Helm. Hro√∞gar married Wealh√æeow, a Helming lady, who thus likely belonged to the Wulfings, and this may explain why Ecg√æeow went to Dane-Land particularly. Hro√∞gar may have been able to use his family ties to persuade the Wulfings to accept the wergild and end the feud. Hr≈ç√∞gƒÅr interprets Beowulf's journey as a son's gratitude for what Hr≈ç√∞gƒÅr had done for Beowulf's father. At lines 2428‚Äì2429 we learn that the young Bƒìowulf was fostered and raised in the home of Hre√∞el starting when he was seven years old; Ecg√æƒìow may have died by then, or the family may just have been following a custom. At lines 2813‚Äì2815 we learn that the thane Wiglaf is a Waegmunding; therefore his father Weohstan was in some way related to Ecg√æeow.

Personal  She was born in Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) in County Dublin, and raised in Dungarvan, County Waterford. She was one of the numerous children of Benjamin Purser, a prosperous flour miller and brewer, and his wife Anne Mallet. She was related to Sir Frederic W. Burton, RHA (1816-1900), who was a son of Hannah Mallet. The Purser family had come to Ireland from Gloucestershire in the eighteenth century. Two of her brothers, John and Louis, became professors at Trinity College Dublin. Her niece Olive Purser, daughter of her brother Alfred, was the first woman scholar in TCD. Until her death she lived for many years in Mespil House, a Georgian mansion with beautiful plaster ceilings on Mespil Road, on the banks of the Grand Canal. Here she was \\"at home\\" every Tuesday afternoon to Dublin's writers and artists; her afternoon parties were a fixture of Dublin literary life.Terence de Vere White A Fretful Midge Routledge and Kegan Paul London 1957 p.129 Mespil House was demolished after she died and developed into apartments. She was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery beside her brothers John and Louis.  Education  At thirteen she attended the Moravian school, Institution Evang√©lique de Montmirail, Switzerland where she learnt to speak fluent French and began painting. In 1873 her father's business failed and she decided to become a full-time painter. She attended classes at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art. She joined the Dublin Sketching Club, where she was later appointed an honorary member. In 1874 she distinguished herself in the National Competition. In 1878 she again contributed to the RHA, and for the next fifty years became a regular exhibitor, mainly portraits, and showed an average of three works per show. In 1878‚Äì79, she studied at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris where she met the German painter Louise Catherine Breslau with whom she became a lifelong friend.  Career  Sarah Purser became wealthy through astute investments, particularly in Guinness, for which several of her male relatives had worked over the years. She was very active in the art world in Dublin and was involved in the setting up of the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, persuading the Irish government to provide Charlemont House in Parnell Square to house the gallery. She was the second woman to sit on the Board of Governors and Guardians, National Gallery of Ireland, 1914‚Äì1943. She was made an Honorary Member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1890; first female Associate Member in 1923 and the first female Member in 1924. In 1924 she initiated the movement for the launching of the Friends of the National Collection of Ireland. Archives relating to Sarah Purser are housed in the Centre for the Study of Irish Art, National Gallery of Ireland. Portraiture She worked mostly as a portraitist. Through her talent and energy, and owing to her friendship with the Gore-Booths, she was very successful in obtaining commissions, famously commenting :\\"I went through the British aristocracy like the measles.\\" When the Viceroy of Ireland commissioned her to portray his children in 1888 his choice reflected her position as the country's foremost portraitist. In 1977 Bruce Arnold noted :\\"some of her finest and most sensitive work was not strictly portraiture, for example, An Irish Idyll in the Ulster Museum, and Le Petit D√©jeuner (in the National Gallery of Ireland).\\" Various portraits painted by Purser are held in the National Gallery of Ireland.  Glass (An T√∫r Gloine)  Sarah Purser financed An T√∫r Gloine (The Tower of Glass), a stained glass cooperative, at 24 Upper Pembroke and ran it from its inauguration in 1903 until her retirement in 1940. Michael Healy (1873-1941) was the first of a number of distinguished recruit, such as Catherine O'Brien (1882-1963), Evie Hone (1894-1955), Wilhelmina Geddes (1887-1955), Beatrice Elvery (1881-1970) and Ethel Rhind (c.1879 -1952). Purser was determined the stained glass workshop should adhere to true Arts and Crafts philosophy: 'Each window is the work of one artist who makes the sketch and cartoon and selects and paints every morsel of glass him or herself'. Purser did not produce many items of stained glass herself. Most of the stained glass works were painted by other members of the co-operative, presumably under her direction. Two early works, 1904, were St. Ita for St. Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea and The Good Shepard for St. Columba's College, Dublin. Her last stained glass work is thought to be The Good Shepard and the Good Samaritan, 1926, for the Church of Ireland at Killucan, Co. Westmeath.

It is the centre of the Tokaj- Hegyalja wine district where Tokaji wine is produced.  History  Tokaj Castle around 1664 The wine-growing area was first mentioned by the name Tokaj in 1067. The town itself was first mentioned in documents in 1353. Its first castle was a motte, which was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. By the 14th century the town already had a stone castle, belonging to the Di√≥sgy≈ër estate. After 1450 Tokaj was the property of the Hunyadi family, so after Matthias Hunyadi became king, the town became a royal estate. In 1705 Francis II R√°k√≥czi ordered the castle to be destroyed. After the Austro- Hungarian Compromise of 1867 the town prospered, but when the World Wars came, it suffered greatly, losing its importance and town status. Even its role in wine trade was taken over by S√°toralja√∫jhely. Tokaj was granted town status again in 1986 and it started to prosper again. Now the town is a popular tourist attraction.

In the Alexiad, Anna describes the political and military history of the Byzantine Empire during the reign of her father, the Byzantine emperor, which makes it a reference on the Byzantium of the High Middle Ages. The Alexiad documents the Byzantine Empire's interaction with the Crusades and highlights the conflicting perceptions of the East and West in the early 12th century. The text was written in a form of artificial Attic Greek. History The Alexiad is divided into 15 books and a prologue; its scope is limited to the duration of Alexios' reign, which it is thus able to depict in full detail. , especially regarding political relations between the Byzantine Empire and western European powers. The Alexiad remains one of the few primary sources recording Byzantine reactions to both the Great Schism of 1054 and the First Crusade, as well as documenting first-hand the decline of Byzantine cultural influence in both eastern and western Europe. According to Peter Frankopan, the content of the Alexiad falls into five main categories: 1\\\\. Attacks against the Byzantine empire by the Normans, under their leader Robert Guiscard (Books 1‚Äì6): :Book 1 addresses Alexios' becoming general and Domestikos ton Scholon. It also discusses the Normans' preparation for their invasion. Book 2 addresses the Komnenian revolt. Book 3 addresses Alexios as Emperor (1081), the internal problems with Doukas family, and the Normans' crossing the Adriatic Sea. Book 4 addresses war against the Normans (1081‚Äì1082). Book 5 also addresses war against the Normans (1082‚Äì1083), and their first clash with the \\"heretics\\". Book 6 addresses the end of war against the Normans (1085) and the death of Robert Guiscard. 2\\\\. Byzantine relations with the Turks (Books 6‚Äì7, 9‚Äì10, and 14‚Äì15): :Book 7 addresses war against the Scythians (1087‚Äì1090). Book 9 addresses operations against Tzachas and the Dalmatians (1092‚Äì1094), and the conspiracy of Nicephorus Diogenes (1094). Book 10 addresses war against the Cumans and the beginning of the First Crusade (1094‚Äì1097). Book 14 addresses Turks, Franks, Cumans, and Manicheans (1108‚Äì1115). Book 15 addresses the last expeditions ‚Äî The Bogomils ‚Äî Death of Alexios (1116‚Äì1118). 3\\\\. Pecheneg incursions on the northern Byzantine frontier (Books 7‚Äì8): :Book 8 addresses the end of the Scythian war (1091) and plots against the Emperor. 4\\\\. The First Crusade and Byzantine reactions to it (Books 10‚Äì11): :Book 11 also addresses the First Crusade (1097‚Äì1104). 5\\\\. Attacks on Byzantine frontiers by Robert Guiscard's son, Bohemond I of Antioch (Books 11‚Äì13) :Book 12 addresses domestic conflicts and the Norman preparation for their second invasion (1105‚Äì1107). Book 13 addresses Aaron's conspiracy and the second Norman invasion (1107‚Äì1108). Although Anna Komnene explicitly states her intention to record true events, important issues of bias do exist. Throughout the Alexiad, emphasis on Alexios as a \\"specifically Christian emperor,\\" morally, as well as politically laudable, is pervasive. Frankopan frequently compares Alexios' treatment in the text to the techniques of the hagiographical tradition, while contrasting it with the generally negative portrait or outright absence of his successors John II and Manuel I. Anna discusses the Latins, (Normans and \\"Franks\\"), considering them barbarians. This distaste extends to the Turks and Armenians. The Alexiad also criticizes John II Komnenos for his accession to the throne (in place of Anna herself) following Alexios' death. From a modern reader's point of view, the inconsistencies in the descriptions of military events and the Empire's misfortunes ‚Äì partially due to these literary and especially Homeric influences ‚Äì may seem exaggerated and stereotypical. Despite these issues, George Ostrogorsky nevertheless emphasizes the importance of the Alexiad as a primary document. General themes The main theme of the Alexiad is the First Crusade, and religious conflict. Anna Komnene chronicles the different groups of people involved in the crusades, and refers to them as \\"Celts\\", \\"Latins\\", and \\"Normans\\". She also talks about her father, Alexios Komnenos in great detail, and his conquests throughout his rule from 1081‚Äì1118. She does this by presenting a \\"Byzantine view\\" of the Crusades. Some historians have noticed the influence of Greek mythology in her work, as stated by Lenora Neville: \\"the characterization of Alexios as wily sea captain steering the empire through constant storms with guile and courage strongly recalls Odysseus.\\" Writing style The Alexiad was originally written in Greek in around 1148, and first edited by Possinus in 1651. Anna Komnene explicitly describes herself in the text and openly acknowledges her feelings and opinions for some events, which goes against the typical formatting of historiography. She differed widely from Greek prose historians, and because of this the book was initially well received, but was subjected to criticism later on. The Alexiad interests many historians because of the fact that Anna wrote it in a different format to the norm of the time. Anna Komnene is the only female Greek historiographer of her era, and historians are keen to believe that her style of writing owes much to her being a woman. Despite including herself in the historiography and the other qualities that make her style vastly different from the typical historiography of the era, Anna Komnene's Alexiad has been seen as a \\"straightforward\\" history. Influences Anna Komnene's writings are a major source of information on her father, Alexios I of the Byzantine Empire. She was around the age of 55 when she began work on the Alexiad. While she was alive, she held the crusaders that came to her father's aid in contempt for their actions against the Empire after they looted various reconquests and failed to return to the Basileus' demesne many of the lands they promised to return to him. She regarded the crusaders, whom she refers to as Celts, Latins and Normans, as uneducated barbarians. Despite this, Anna claims that she portrayed them in a neutral light. Some historians believe her work to be biased because of her feelings towards the Crusaders, and how highly she regarded her father. Gender and authorship =Questions of authorship= There has been much debate as to whether the Alexiad was in fact written by Anna Komnene herself, with one scholar saying that the text gives very few comments that would suggest the author's gender or any other aspect of their background, aside from a few explicit mentions. This has led some scholars to argue that the Alexiad was not written by a woman at all, but by some other male author.For examples, see This belief, put forward by Howard-Johnston, focuses mainly on the military sections of the Alexiad, and suggests that Anna was merely working from her husband's field notes, thus Howard-Johnston renames it \\"Nicephoros's Alexiad.\\" However, it is largely agreed that Anna Komnene was the author. Explicit mentions in the text of her engagement, her role as a wife, and the commentary on her female modesty that influences her writing make Anna's authorship of the Alexiad \\"unmistakable\\", according to some. She certainly could have written about military affairs, since she was able to accompany her father, the emperor, on military campaigns. Many scholars believe that the great detail about her father's home life and military style, combined with her own personal experiences and mentions of femininity, provide a strong case for her authorship of the Alexiad. =Representations of gender= In the Alexiad, Anna Komnene portrays gender and gender stereotypes in a unique way. Like her male counterparts, she characterizes women along the typical stereotypes, such as being \\"liable to tears and as cowardly in the face of danger\\". Yet, despite this, women in the Alexiad never cry, with the exception of Alexios' funeral, during which grief is the appropriate cultural response. Likewise, none of the female characters act in a cowardly way. She points to her own gender in a similar way when mentioning her own tears while writing certain events. Immediately, however, she informs the reader that she will stop crying in order to properly return to her duty of history, an episode which she repeats twice in the narrative.Komnene Alexiad 4.8.1 and Prol. 4.2. By so doing, she shows a desire to control aspects that are, for her culture, feminine. Overall, however, Anna concerns herself primarily with intellect, which she attributes to both men and women, and allows for women to actively break out of societal gender roles in the Alexiad. Her personal attitudes, along with the lack of comparable sources from female authors in that era, make the Alexiad considered by some a poor source to use when gauging how average women in Byzantium felt about the First Crusade. =Gender and style= Anna Komnene's somewhat unusual style of writing history has been attributed to her gender. Her style is noteworthy in that it included both a history of her father's actions during the First Crusade, and her reactions to some of these events. Her opinions and commentary on particular events in an otherwise historical text have been assigned to her gender both positively and negatively. This interpretation of her histories is known as a \\"gendered history\\", meaning it is both the history of Alexos and of Anna herself through her particular style, which is not seen in male authors. While the Roman historian Edward Gibbon saw this \\"gendered\\" narrative to betray \\"in every page the vanity of a female author\\", with some scholars agreeing with him, other scholars claim that this style might be indicative of Anna's mentor, Michael Psellos. Some take this even further to suggest that Anna used Psellos' Chronographia as a model for her personal narration in her history and took his style even further, suggesting it was not her gender but her influences that led to her writing style. Anna Komnene is considered unique for her time in the intensity by which she integrates her own narrative and emotion, and yet she does not mention all personal details, such as the fact that she had four children. For some, this unusual combination of style and lack of personal, gendered information is reconciled by her lack of modern feminist ideals, without which she was not interested in questioning her societal place in her own narrative, even though her depictions of women do not fit in with male authors of the time. Instead, her style can be understood from her belief system that intelligence and nobility cancel out gender in terms of importance, and so Anna does not view her history as overstepping any necessary gender roles.

The film stars Paul Bettany as a journeyman tennis pro (once ranked 11th) and Kirsten Dunst as an up-and-coming tennis star. Sam Neill and Jon Favreau co- star. Plot Peter Colt, a British professional tennis player in his thirties whose ranking has slipped from 11th to 119th in the world, has never really had to fight for anything, as his wealthy family allowed him to easily pursue his tennis ambitions. Though he earns a wildcard spot to the Wimbledon tournament, he feels it's time to admit he's getting too old to compete with fitter up-and-coming younger players and intends, after this last Wimbledon, to take a job with a prestigious tennis club. As Wimbledon begins, he bumps into Lizzie Bradbury, the American rising star of female tennis. They fall in love and her interest in him changes his entire perception, even giving him the strength to win again. As their love grows, Peter's game becomes better and better. Lizzie's overprotective father-manager Dennis Bradbury is determined to nip their relationship in the bud, believing it detrimental to her career. One day, Dennis comes to Peter's old flat and yells at him for spoiling his daughter's game. Lizzie overhears this and decides to leave him and focus on her game. The night before their semifinal matches, Peter sneaks into Lizzie's hotel room and persuades her to have sex. The next day, he performs above expectations and wins in straight sets, but Lizzie loses. Lizzie angrily breaks up with Peter, claiming his selfishness made her lose, and decides to immediately return to the United States to train. Peter has to play the final match against Jake Hammond, an arrogant American star and world number 1. At the airport, Lizzie watches an interview on TV in which Peter apologizes and declares his love for her. She returns to Wimbledon. As Lizzie reaches the stadium, Peter has lost two sets in the final and is behind in the third. When the game is suspended due to rain, Lizzie appears in the dressing room and forgives him. She tells him the secret of Jake's tricky serves and Peter fights back to win the title (3‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4, 7‚Äì6(8-6), 6‚Äì4). Now a national hero in Britain, he and Lizzie get married. With his support, Lizzie goes on to win the U.S. Open and Wimbledon twice, ultimately achieving her dreams. In the last scene, Peter is with their younger child, a boy, watching Lizzie and their elder child, a girl, playing tennis on a neighborhood court in New York City.

Production =Writing= In the original script, Lizzie steps nude out of the shower upon meeting Peter. Dunst filmed the scene nude, but before the film's release she persuaded director Richard Loncraine to edit it so her nudity was removed. The result shows Dunst behind the glass shower door, then suddenly cuts to a shoulders-up view of her standing outside the glass door. The film is dedicated to Mark McCormack, founder of International Management Group, a management firm for high-level athletes, who died on 16 May 2003. =Casting= The film used locally recruited Wimbledon residents as extras for the crowd scenes. =Filming= The actors served with real tennis balls. All others were added digitally to make it appear like they were playing. =Locations= Some scenes were filmed during the 2003 championships between matches. It is the only time in the history of the tournament that this has been allowed. Some court scenes with Bettany were filmed at the Stoke Park Country Club, home of The Boodles Challenge. London Zoo's entrance was used for the entrance to Wimbledon. The beachfront scenes were filmed on location in Brighton. Reception =Critical reception= Wimbledon received mixed reviews, with a 61% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 145 reviews with an average rating of 5.87/10. The consensus reads, \\"A predictable, bland rom-com, but Bettany proves to be an appealing lead.\\" It received \\"average\\" or \\"mixed\\" reviews from Metacritic, a 59 out of 100 based on reviews by 35 critics. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that Wimbledon was a \\"much more conventional film\\", but with \\"cleverer-than-average dialogue and sharply drawn subsidiary characters\\". Michael Charlotte's review for Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying, \\"In tennis parlance, this fires off more moonballs to stay in play than outright winning shots. But Bettany is charming, and thankfully he and Dunst are appealing together\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review: \\"Wimbledon is a well-behaved movie about nice people who have good things happen to them. That's kind of startling, in a world where movie characters, especially in sports movies, occupy the edge of human experience. What a surprise to hear conversation instead of dialogue, and to realize that the villain may actually be right some of the time\\". He gave the film three out of four stars. =Box office= The film opened at number four, grossing US$7.1 million in its opening weekend at the North American box office. Soundtrack The film's digital soundtrack uses the \\"Surround EX\\" format. The song that plays in the trailer of the film is \\"Everlasting Love\\" by U2. The film features two songs by the Sugababes: \\"Caught in a Moment\\" and \\"Sometimes\\", both from the album Three.

Initially a member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), he later became a prominent exponent of National Bolshevism. Early life Born in Trebnitz (Silesia), and brought up in N√∂rdlingen, he became a schoolteacher by profession.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, p. 279 He joined the Social Democratic Party in 1917 and was instrumental in the setting up of a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Indeed, for a time at the start of the year, following the resignation of Kurt Eisner and immediately before the establishment of the Bavarian Soviet Republic, Niekisch wielded effective power as chairman of the central executive of Bavarian councils, an interim governing body.Chris Harman, The Lost Revolution: Germany 1918 to 1923, Bookmarks, 1982, pp. 129-130 He left the SPD soon after and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) for a time before he returned to his former party. He served a brief spell in prison in 1925 for his part in the abortive Bavarian coup.Alastair Hamilton, The Appeal of Fascism: A Study of Intellectuals and Fascism 1919-1945, London: Anthony Blond, 1971, p. 127 Nationalism The eagle symbol of National Bolshevism In the 1920s, he stressed the importance of nationalism and attempted to turn the SPD in that direction. He was so vehemently opposed to the Dawes Plan, the Locarno Treaties and the general pacifism of the SPD that he was expelled from the party in 1926. Upon his expulsion, Niekisch joined the Old Social Democratic Party of Saxony, which he influenced to his own nationalist form of socialism. He launched his own journal Widerstand (Resistance)., and he his followers adopted the name of \\"National Bolsheviks\\" and looked to the Soviet Union as a continuation of both Russian nationalism and the old state of Prussia. The movement took the slogan of \\"Sparta-Potsdam-Moscow\\". He was a member of ARPLAN (Association for the Study of Russian Planned Economy) with Ernst J√ºnger, Georg Luk√°cs, Karl Wittfogel and Friedrich Hielscher, under whose auspices he visited the Soviet Union in 1932. He reacted favourably to J√ºnger's publication Der Arbeiter, which he saw as a blueprint for a National Bolshevik Germany. He also believed in the necessity of a German-Soviet alliance against the \\"decadent West\\" and the Treaty of Versailles.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, Warner Books, 1998, p. 315 The attempt to combine ultranationalism and communism, two extreme ends of the political spectrum, made Niekisch's National Bolsheviks a force with little support.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism 1914-45, Routledge, 1995, p. 163 Third Reich Although anti-Jewish and in favour of a totalitarian state, Niekisch rejected Adolf Hitler, who he felt lacked any real socialism, and Niekisch instead looked to Joseph Stalin and the industrial development of the Soviet Union as his model for the F√ºhrerprinzip. Writing in 1958, Niekisch condemned Hitler as a power-obsessed demagogue who was an enemy of the elitist spirit that Niekisch advocated.Roger Griffin, Fascism, Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 318-319 He was particularly ill- disposed towards Joseph Goebbels and, at a meeting between the two facilitated by their mutual friend, Arnolt Bronnen, Niekisch and Goebbels had almost come to blows.Hamilton, The Appeal of Fascism, p. 138 Bronnen would break from Niekisch in 1932 after the latter published the pamphlet Hitler - ein deutsches Verh√§ngnis, with Bronnen considering the attack on Nazism a personal insult.Hamilton, The Appeal of Fascism, p. 143 In the immediate aftermath of the Reichstag fire, his house was searched for evidence of any involvement, but that was not pursued.Hamilton, The Appeal of Fascism, p. 166 He also discussed his opposition to the new regime with Ulrich von Hassell although Niekisch did not join the German Resistance. Despite his criticisms of Nazism, he was allowed to continue editing Widerstand until the paper was banned in December 1934. He was allowed to visit Rome in 1935 and held meetings with Benito Mussolini, who told Niekisch that he considered Hitler's aggressive stances towards the Soviet Union to be foolish and would later discuss opposition groups with the Italian Consul General while Italo-German relations were somewhat strained. He was arrested in 1937 by the Gestapo and was sentenced, two years later, to life imprisonment at the Volksgerichtshof for 'literary high treason'. Following the intervention of his former ally, J√ºnger, his family could retain his property but not secure Niekisch's release. He was released in 1945, when he had become blind. Later life Embittered against nationalism by his wartime experiences, he turned to orthodox Marxism and lectured in sociology in Humboldt University in East Germany until 1953 when, disillusioned by the brutal suppression of the workers' uprising, he moved to West Berlin, where he later died. Legacy Subsequent to his death, Niekisch was one of a number of writers, including the likes of Oswald Spengler, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Vilfredo Pareto and Carl Schmitt, whose works were promulgated by the likes of the Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne and others involved in the Conservative Revolutionary movement.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 210 Works * Der Weg der deutschen Arbeiterschaft zum Staat.

Other common names include larder beetle, hide or leather beetles, carpet beetles, and khapra beetles. There are approximately 500 to 700 species worldwide. They can range in size from 1 to 12 mm. Key characteristics for adults are round oval shaped bodies covered in scales or setae.Byrd, Jason. Castner, James (2001). Forensic Entomology: The Utility of Arthropods in Legal Investigations The usually clubbed antennae fit into deep grooves. The hind femora also fit into recesses of the coxa. Larvae are scarabaeiform and also have setae. Dermestids have a variety of habits; most genera are scavengers that feed on dry animal or plant material, such as skin or pollen, animal hair, feathers, dead insects and natural fibers. Members of Dermestes are found in animal carcasses, while others may be found in mammal, bird, bee, or wasp nests. Thaumaglossa only lives in the egg cases of mantids, while Trogoderma species are pests of grain. These beetles are significant in forensic entomology. Some species are associated with decaying carcasses, which helps with criminal investigations. Some species are pests (urban entomology) and can cause extensive damage to natural fibers in homes and businesses. They are used in taxidermy and by natural history museums to clean animal skeletons. Some dermestid species, commonly called \\"bow bugs\\", infest violin cases, feeding on the bow hair. Forensic relevance =Urban and stored products= Dermestid beetles are destructive to a number of common items. Natural fibers such as wool, silk, cotton, linen, fur, or feathers are much more prone to attack than synthetic fibers.P.G. Koehler and F.M. Oi (1991). Carpet Beetles. University of Florida IFAS Extension Dermestids also attack chocolate, copra, and cocoa beans.Walker, K. (2008). Hide Beetle . Pest and Diseases Image Library Most damage is done by the larvae, as the adults feed on flowers and shrubs. =Medicolegal= Dermestid beetles being used to clean a human skull at Skulls Unlimited International, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Dermestes maculatus, hide beetles, also have the potential to offer investigators an estimation of the time since death in homicide or questionable cases. Similar to the use of flies in forensic entomology, the arrival of D. maculatus to carrion occurs in a predictable succession. Adult D. maculatus beetles generally arrive 5 to 11 days after death. In an attempt to refine this relatively wide range, recent research has repeated arthropod succession studies. These studies are applied to estimate the arrival of various species of Dermestidae after death. Development for Dermestids is temperature dependent, and the optimal temperature for D. maculatus is 30ÀöC. Development data is normalized using Accumulated Degree Days. Dermestids can also be used in cases involving entomotoxicology, where feces and shed larval skins can be analyzed for toxins. Dermestes maculatus collected from raccoon carcass: Image:Dermestidae 1.jpg|Lateral view (Dermestes maculatus) Image:Dermestidae 2.jpg|Head view (D. maculatus) Image:Dermestidae 7.jpg|Ventral view (D. maculatus) Image:Dermestidae 6.jpg|Dorsal view (D. maculatus) General larval characteristics Like all beetles, Dermestid beetles boast a complete or holometabolous development, which includes an egg, larva, pupa, and adult stage. As opposed to ametabolous or hemimetabolous development, where the larva's wings start off as internal wing pads and, as development progresses, the wings begin to develop externally, Dermestid larvae never have visible wing pads. Dermestid larvae are profoundly covered with varying lengths of setae that give a general \\"fluffy\\" appearance.Beetle Identification . Pest Solutions Plus. The larvae are generally dark brown to black and possess a pair of spine-like appendages on the terminal end of the abdomen. Most beetle larvae have chewing mouthparts,Corpse Fauna: Beetle Larvae. Decomposition. an obvious head capsule, which is sclerotized, as well as three pairs of well developed thoracic legs that easily distinguish them from Diptera maggots. The larva's size depends on the species and is typically much less than 1/2 of an inch. Dermestid larvae are typically found on dry organic items that are hard for other organisms to digest, such as dried foodstuffs, skins, hides, wood and other natural fibers. In forensic studies, the larvae are found on human corpses during the dry and skeletal phases of decomposition, which occurs several days after death.Forensic Entomology: Use of Insects to Help Solve Crime. Forensic Investigations. Larvae also move away from light and often hide in any cavity in order to remain undisturbed.

University of Rhode Island Green Share Factsheets. It has two back-curved, spine-like appendages on the posterior end. The larva of the black larder beetle has less strongly curved appendages. Mature larvae of both species tend to bore into hard substrates such as wood, cork, and plaster to pupate.Lyon, W. F. Hide and Larder Beetles. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Larder beetles are infrequent household pests. Adults and larvae feed on raw skins and hides. Adult larder beetles are generally 1/3 to 3/8 of an inch long and are dark brown with a broad, pale yellow spotted band across the upper portion of the elytra. There are three black dots arranged in a triangle shape on each wing. The sternum and legs of the larder beetle are covered in fine, yellow setae. Adult larder beetles are typically found outdoors in protected areas during the winter, but during the spring and early summer they enter buildings. Females lay approximately 135 eggs near a food source, and the eggs will hatch in about 12 days. The life cycle of larder beetles lasts around 40 to 50 days. The black larder or incinerator beetle, Dermestes ater, is completely dark with scattered yellow setae on the body. It is similar to Dermestes maculatus but lacks serrations on its elytra. Its ventral surface is yellow instead of white. This beetle is a pest of fish, mushrooms, and cheese.Genus Dermestes. BugGuide. =Hide beetle (leather beetle)= Dermestes maculatus, known as the hide beetle, leather beetle, or skin beetle, feeds on raw skins and hides like the larder beetle. This species is similar in appearance to the larder beetle, with short and long reddish brown or black setae, but its two spine-like posterior appendages curve forward. Also, the forewings are dark brown and the sternum is mostly white with some black.Bennett, S. M. (2003). Dermestes maculatus. Its life cycle is 60 to 70 days and the female can lay up to 800 eggs. The hide and larder beetles both feed on an assortment of animal protein based products and cause serious damage in the areas of silkworm production and museums. =Carpet beetle= The carpet beetle larvae start to feed as soon as they hatch. They are carrot shaped and heavily covered with setae, especially on their posterior end. The number of instars differ from 5‚Äì11 and in some cases reach up to 20. Larvae of the black carpet beetle Attagenus megatoma may grow up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of carpet beetle are regularly 1/4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm) long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source.Lyon, William F. Carpet Beetle. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. The larvae of the carpet beetle are often referred to as \\"woolly bears\\" or \\"buffalo moths\\". =Black carpet beetle= The black carpet beetle, Attagenus megatoma, is a widely known stored product pest and one of the most destructive because of its potential damage to household products containing keratin, which is a protein found in animal hair and feathers.Dermestid Beetle . Texas A&M; University Entomology. They are also able to burrow through various types of food packaging, allowing passage for other insects. Females can lay up to 90 eggs and they hatch in about 8 to 15 days. Generally, this species only has one generation a year. The time it takes to become an adult varies from six months to a year. In addition, an adult black carpet beetle can live for an additional two months.Exploring California Insects: Carpet or Museum Beetles . The average adult size is about 2.8 to 5 mm long and they are oval, dark brown to shiny-black in color, and have brown legs. =Varied carpet beetle= The varied carpet beetle, Anthrenus verbasci, attacks typical household objects. Carpet beetles are normally associated with things such as carpets, wool, furs, and any processed animal or plant food. Their appetite also includes dead insects, spiders, and even nectar and pollen. They are typically found throughout the United States and Canada. Females can lay up to 40 eggs and the number of larval instars range from 7‚Äì8 stages. The time it takes to become an adult varies from about eight months to a year. In addition, the adults can live around 2 to 6 weeks. This species varies in shape, size, color, and pattern of scales. On average, the adults are 2 to 3 mm in length and have scales that vary from white, brown, yellow, or even gray-yellow. The hairs of the larvae can cause allergic reactions such as contact dermatitis or blisters in humans who come into contact with the sharp tiny hairs. =Khapra beetle= On hatching, the larvae are around 1.6 to 1.8 mm long and mostly filled with dense setae. Khapra beetle, Trogoderma granarium, larvae contain characteristic body setae, such as simple hairs and barbed hairs. Larvae are yellow-white but the head and body setae are brown. As the larvae further develop, their color changes to a golden or reddish brown and the abdomen portion becomes proportionally shorter. The mature larvae reach a maximum length of 6 mm long and 1.5 mm wide.Harris, D.L. (2006) Khapra Beetle. University of Florida IFAS Extension. The khapra beetle is a stored-product pest. Infestations are difficult to control because they crawl into cracks and crevices, remaining for long periods of time. They tend to infest grains and create serious losses to stored products. The adults are covered with setae and are approximately 1.5 to 3 mm long and 1 to 2 mm wide. Male khapra beetles are brown to black with reddish brown markings on the elytra. Females are slightly larger and are lighter in color. The short, 11 segmented antennae has a club of 3 to 5 segments, which fit into a groove on the side of the pronotum. Control =Hide and larder beetles= Modern methods of meat slaughtering, storage, and distribution have reduced potential infestations of hide beetles. Proper housekeeping is crucial for the prevention of infestations. Dead insects in homes usually attract these beetles because they are a prime food source for hide and larder beetles. Food must be tightly sealed or stored in a refrigerator to avoid any beetle access. Freezing food for a week or heating meat in a pan or microwave for prolonged lengths can kill insects found in infested foods and prevent them from spreading. Household fibers, such as wool and silk, are especially prone to moth damage and special cleaning, which includes moth proofing, needs to be done frequently. Application of insecticides must be by spot treatment to crack and crevice sites where they are suspected of hiding. Pyrethrins are labeled for use against hide beetles. Insecticides used for carpet beetles are also appropriate to use against hide and larder beetles. =Carpet beetles= Regular cleaning of spilled food or lint will eliminate any sites for potential breeding. Susceptible items like food, woolens, and furs should be stored in an insect proof container. If an infestation is suspected then the source of the problem must be removed and destroyed to further limit any possibility of spreading. These beetles can be killed with extreme heat or exposure to freezers.Cranshaw, W.S. (2000). Carpet Beetles. Colorado University State-Extension. Pyrethroid insecticides can be used to control carpet beetles. Products containing active ingredients such as permethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, tralomethrin are components of the Pyrethroid insecticide. Diatomaceous earth is also effective.

Ordered from Fleming & Ferguson of Paisley, Scotland on 27 July 1939, she was launched on 24 April 1940 and commissioned in July 1940. She served in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Arctic campaigns, escorting several convoys to Russia, and also took part in the invasions of Sicily and France. She was torpedoed and sunk by under the command of Hans-G√ºnther Lange in the Kola Inlet on 17 February 1945 while escorting the convoy RA-64 from Murmansk. Only one member of her crew survived. Service history After commissioning and sea trials in July 1940, Bluebell was deployed on Atlantic convoy escort duties. Commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Robert Sherwood, one of her first duties, in October 1940, was to meet Convoy SC 7 mid-ocean. She rescued all 39 officers and men from the cargo steamship , which had been torpedoed and sunk on 17 October. Sherwood subsequently appeared in the 1973 TV programme The World at War, in the episode Wolf Pack. In January 1941 Bluebell was attached to the 5th Escort Group, Western Approaches Command, based at Liverpool, to escort Atlantic convoys, transferring in September to the 37th Escort Group for the defence of convoys between Gibraltar and ports in West Africa. She returned to the UK in July 1942 to refit, and was assigned for service on the Russian Convoys. In September she sailed to Iceland to join the escort of Convoy PQ 18 to Arkhangelsk, returning in November, and resuming Atlantic convoy escort duties in December and January. In February 1943 she joined the escort of Convoy JW 53 from Loch Ewe to Kola Inlet, returning in March to resume duties in the Western Approaches. In June 1943 Bluebell was sent to the Mediterranean, and in early July was part of the escort for assault convoys during the initial landings in the Allied invasion of Sicily, remaining in the Mediterranean for further convoy escort duties until August when she returned to the Western Approaches. Between February and April 1944 she escorted Russian Convoys JW 57 and JW 58, and in May was transferred to Escort Group 143 to prepare for the invasion of Normandy. On 6 June she formed part of Convoy ECL1 escorting LSTs from the Bristol Channel to the landing beaches, then escorted follow-up convoys until released on 25 June. In August she was transferred to the 8th Escort Group and joined the escort force for Russian Convoy JW 59, returning in September. After further convoy defence and interception duties, on 2 February 1945 she was attached to the escort for Russian Convoy JW 64. After arriving at Kola Inlet she took part in anti- submarine operations against U-boats known to be gathering to carry out attacks on the return convoy. On 17 February, as Convoy RA 64 was assembling off Murmansk, Bluebell was hit in the stern by an acoustic homing torpedo fired by , which caused her depth charges to explode. She sank in less than 30 seconds at . From her crew of 86 ratings and officers there was only one survivor: Albert Holmes from Southampton.

A breakaway group from the National Front, the BDP was severely damaged after it became involved in a gun-running sting and was absorbed by the British National Party. Formation and naming controversy The BDP emerged following the 1979 general election in which the National Front (NF) had put up the greatest number of candidates in its history. However, despite this results fell way below the party's expectations. The recriminations that followed this financially costly defeat saw Andrew Brons replace John Tyndall as chairman whilst a number of groups broke away from the NF, notably the New National Front and the Constitutional Movement. Within the NF, the Leicester branch had become one of the most active in the country and, since 1972, this group had been led by Anthony Reed Herbert, a local solicitor whose talent for organisation had made Leicester a model branch. Reed Herbert took the opportunity provided by the 1979 collapse of the NF to launch his own group, initially selecting the name British Peoples Party. However, the name was quickly changed in order to avoid association with the earlier British People's Party, a splinter group from the National Socialist League, organised either side of the Second World War.S. Taylor, The National Front in English Politics, London: Macmillan, 1982, p. 91 The name was thus changed to British Democratic Party even though a British Democratic Party, a minor right wing anti-communist group, had also previously existed in the 1930s. The BDP shared with the Constitutional Movement a desire to move away from open neo-Nazism in general and Tyndall and Martin Webster in particular, with Reed Herbert reasoning that a stream of press exposures of the more extreme views of both men had hit the NF's election chances hard. Effectively therefore the BDP sought to present a more \\"respectable\\" public image in contrast to that of the NF.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000, p. 176. Development The BDP quickly gained a following within Leicester, capturing 11% of the vote in the first local elections it contested, a highly respectable score for a new and virtually unknown party. However the British Movement's Ray Hill also became involved and, after giving a copy of the party's membership list to Searchlight magazine, soon began secretly working for the anti-fascist publication full-time. Although never formally a member of the BDP Hill, on instructions from Searchlight, took a leading role in helping Reed Herbert to organise the new party. Hill also took over production of the party's newspaper British News. Hill's association with both the BDP and BM was not unusual as BDP members Dave Gagin, Chris Newman, Jack Munton and Chris Harrison all held simultaneous membership of the BM. The association of Hill with the BDP meant that many of its activities were exposed in the press. Thus a celebration for Adolf Hitler's birthday held in 1980 in an illegal bar in the basement of the party's headquarters was reported in the Daily Mirror. Hill also fomented a plan to take over the British Movement, suggesting to Reed Herbert that the two groups could unite once it was successful, although this idea too was driven by a Searchlight plan to bring about divisions within the BM. Hill further informed the magazine on BDP plans to obtain weapons and to set up an illegal television transmitter, although information about both schemes was initially vague. World in Action incident The BDP became embroiled in a 1981 scheme developed by the World in Action documentary series in which an American claiming to be a neo-Nazi gunrunner (but who was actually working for the programme) was put in touch with the BDP. Before long, Hill became involved in order to facilitate the sting. 'Bob Matthews', as the American claimed to be called, told Reed Herbert that he needed a gun in order to raid a US Army armoury, and Reed Herbert agreed to supply a single weapon for ¬£200. BDP member John Grand Scrutton was chosen to ferry the weapon, a luger pistol, to a secret location arranged in advance with 'Matthews' before phoning the American to let him know more details. The resulting phone call, in which Scrutton suggested that the BDP could get hold of six more guns and told 'Matthews' to send payments to Reed Herbert's address, was recorded by World in Action and broadcast on the show. Reed Herbert learned of the ruse from a journalist immediately prior to the broadcast of the episode as did Scrutton, whose finger prints were on the luger which by that point was in police custody. Reed Herbert sent Scrutton, under Hill's care, to a hideout in the Republic of Ireland but before long Scrutton returned to Britain and had to be brought back to Ireland by Hill. Reed Herbert eventually told Scrutton to go to South Africa and Scrutton, along with Hill, was put on a plane that stopped over at Paris-Orly Airport. However Hill had informed Searchlight about the plan and they in turn had tipped off the French authorities who arrested Scrutton and Hill before sending them back to Ireland. Under Hill's prompting, Scrutton contacted the show's producer Geoffrey Seed and, after three days of interviews, they convinced him to return to Leicester and give himself up to police. Scrutton eventually returned and made a full statement, but despite this statement, no charges were ever brought against Scrutton or any member of the BDP in regards to the weapons offences. Disappearance Despite the incident Hill, who had moved on to a new plan to work with and undermine John Tyndall, remained close to the BDP and sought to continue working to damage the party. At this time the party also enjoyed the support of influential publisher Anthony Hancock, although he too was close to the BM and was less sure about Tyndall. Nonetheless, the gun-running incident forced the BDP to cease almost all operations, and it came as little surprise when it was brought to a conclusion in 1982 by re-joining Tyndall and Hill as founder members of the British National Party.David Boothroyd, The History of British Political Parties, Politico's Publishing, 2001, p. 17 References ; Bibliography : : Defunct political parties in England National Front (UK) breakaway groups Organisations based in Leicestershire Political parties established in 1979 Political parties disestablished in 1982 Politics of Leicester ","title":"British Democratic Party"},{"id":"988182","text":"Jax may refer to: Places * Jax, Haute-Loire, France * Jacksonville, Florida, United States ** Jacksonville station, Amtrak station ** Jacksonville International Airport ** Naval Air Station Jacksonville People * Garth Jax (born 1963), American football player * Jax (singer) (born 1996), American singer and American Idol contestant * Jax Dane (born 1981), American professional wrestler * Jax Jones (born 1987), British musician * Jax Malcolm (born 2003), American actor * Nia Jax (born 1984), American wrestler * Aaron Jackson aka Jaxx ( born 1976), Musician: group- A.p.prehended / Actor: Rest in peace Cuervo Jones and The last Castle Brands and companies * JAX Tyres, Australian retailer * Jackson Laboratory, biology research center * Jax Brewing Company, brewery in Jacksonville, Florida * Jax Media, film and television production company Arts and literature * Jax and the Hellhound, comic book series =Characters= * Jax (Mortal Kombat), fictional character from the Mortal Kombat game series * Jasper Jacks, character from the TV show General Hospital * \\"Jaxx\\" Character played by Ruby Rose in the movie \\"The Meg\\" * Jackson \\"Jax\\" Teller, character from the TV show Sons of Anarchy * Jax, character from the comic strip You Can with Beakman and Jax * Jax Amnell, character from Terry Goodkind's novel The Law of Nines * Jax, character from League of Legends * Jax, character from Elex * Jax, a Beast Bot in Power Rangers Beast Morphers Sports * Jacksonville Jaguars, American professional football franchise * Jacksonville Jax, former minor league baseball team * FC JAX Destroyers, American former professional soccer team * Portland LumberJax, American former professional lacrosse team Other uses * Jambi Malay, language spoken in Indonesia * Java XML, set of APIs for the Java programming language * Jax Panik, South African performing act * Ornipholidotos jax, butterfly in the family Lycaenidae See also * Jacks (disambiguation) * Jackson (disambiguation) * MathJax, software tool to display mathematical equations in web browsers ","title":"Jax"},{"id":"988185","text":"The Logo of the ZVV The ZVV (German abbreviation for Z√ºrcher Verkehrsverbund, translated into English as Z√ºrich Transport Network or Z√ºrich Traffic Network) is a public transportation system. It combines rail, bus, tram, trolleybus, lake boat, cable car and other services in the Swiss canton of Z√ºrich (and including Rapperswil-Jona (SG), Pf√§ffikon SZ and spots outside of the canton) integrating them into a single fare network with coordinated timetables. Fares are based on the number of zones crossed during a specified time and are independent of the mode of transport or the number of connections.  History  The system was established in May 1990 as a unified fare system with a coordinated local train network. Local train lines were prefixed with the letter S (S-Bahn). S-Lines 1 through 43 (with some lines missing) and now form part of the S-Bahn Network. A proof-of-payment fare system is in force on all S-Bahn trains. Fare gates are not used, but those caught without a valid ticket during a random inspection face a minimum fine of CHF 100.  Zones  The ZVV system uses an integrated a ticket network. The zones are numbered 110-184; the numbers 180-184 designates zones outside of the canton's border. Passengers purchase a base ticket for particular zones. Upgrades and extension tickets are available as supplements. Trips by fast trains and regional trains by any operator, such as ICN, InterCity (IC), InterRegio (IR), RegioExpress (RE), regional (R) lines, and even international railways are part of the fare network as long as they stop within the fare network's borders.

He antagonised several eminent authors, but attracted a coterie that was dubbed the Squirearchy. He was also a poet and historian, who captained a famous literary cricket-team called the Invalids.  Biography  Born in Plymouth, he was educated at Blundell's School and St. John's College, Cambridge. He was one of those published in the Georgian poetry collections of Edward Marsh. His own Selections from Modern Poets anthology series, launched in 1921, became definitive of the conservative style of Georgian poetry. He began reviewing for The New Age;Eric Homberger, Ezra Pound (1997), p. 83. through his wife he had met Alfred Orage.Adrian Smith, The New Statesman: Portrait of a Political Weekly, 1913‚Äì1931 (1996), p. 23. His literary reputation was first made by a flair for parody, in a column Imaginary Speeches in The New Age from 1909. His poetry from World War I was satirical; at the time he was reviewing for the New Statesman, using the name Solomon Eagle (taken from a Quaker of the seventeenth century) ‚Äì one of his reviews from 1915 was of The Rainbow by D.

From 1919 to 1934, Squire was the editor of the monthly periodical, the London Mercury. It showcased the work of the Georgian poets and was an important outlet for new writers. Alec Waugh described the elements of Squire's 'hegemony' as acquired largely by accident, consequent on his rejection for military service for bad sight. Squire's natural persona was of a beer-drinking, cricketing West Countryman; his literary cricket XI, the Invalids (originally made up of men who had been wounded in the First World War),\\"Obituary\\", The Cricketer, Spring Annual 1959, p. 95. were immortalised in A.

In contract law, it is the implied ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract on behalf of an organization, by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. When a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the logo or trademark of a business or organization; or if that person is functioning in an obviously authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization, that person carries an Implied Authority of Contract. Implied Authority is authority that is not express or written into the contract, but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of insurance for the principal. Implied authority is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract. For example, if you are at a restaurant and your waitress tells you that she can give you a free beverage if you pay for an entree, she has made a contract with you on behalf of the business by which she is employed. It is implied that she is given the authority to do so by the fact that she is the sole employee of the business who has been designated to complete a transaction with you. (Whether or not other employees ultimately get involved in your transaction is irrelevant, because it is expected that ideally she is the only person required to complete your business.) Continuing the scenario, suppose that a manager were to come to your table and inform you that your waitress has made a mistake; that the \\"free beverage w/ paid entree\\" offer has expired and that you will be expected to pay for your beverage. At this point the business is in direct violation of a legally enforceable contract made between you, the client, and their employee. They may penalize the employee for the mistake, but Implied Authority of Contract places them under a legal obligation to honor the terms of the agreement. The same principle applies to more complex or extreme legal circumstances. A design professional's implied authority gives the designer the means to act in ways that are incidental to the exercise of actual authority. It is authority that isn't written down, but needs to be understood to make the construction process a success. Besides Implied Authority, look into Apparent Authority and Express Authority as well. In relation to companies, apparent authority is usually referred to as \\"ostensible authority\\". -These three are known as the Agency Relationship Contract law ","title":"Implied authority"},{"id":"988208","text":"A non-Inuit version of an Eskimo kiss An Eskimo kiss, also called kunik, nose kiss, or nose rub, is the act of pressing the tip of one's nose against another's nose usually interpreted as a friendly greeting gesture in various cultures. Etymology When early explorers of the Arctic first witnessed Inuit nose rubbing as a greeting behavior, they dubbed it Eskimo kissing. The Eskimo kiss was used as an intimate greeting by the Inuit who, when they meet outside, often have little except their nose and eyes exposed. Many Inuit prefer for this gesture to be referred to as kunik, as they consider Eskimo a slur against themselves and their culture. Representation in different cultures =Inuit= Kunik The Eskimo kiss is employed by the Inuit as a traditional greeting called a kunik. A kunik is a form of expressing affection, usually between family members and loved ones, that involves pressing the nose and upper lip against the skin (commonly of the cheeks or forehead) and breathing in, causing the loved one's skin or hair to be suctioned against the nose and upper lip. A common misconception is that the practice arose so that Inuit could kiss without their mouths freezing together. Rather, it is a non-erotic but intimate greeting used by people who, when they meet outside, often have little except their nose and eyes exposed. The greeting was described in reports of a group of Alaska Native people touring the United States with entrepreneur Miner W. Bruce in the 1890s: \\"Mr. Bruce yesterday instructed Kerlungner and Wearner that in this country they should not rub noses, and to close the lesson the two young women kissed each other in the new style for a beginning, both seeming to fear that they looked silly as they did it.\\" =Other cultures= Other peoples use similar greeting practices, notably the MƒÅori of New Zealand and Hawaiians, who practice the hongi and honi greetings, respectively. Mongolian nomads of the Gobi Desert have a similar practice, as do certain Southeast Asian cultures, such as Bengalis, Cambodians, Laotians, Thai, Vietnamese, Timor, Sabu, Sumba, The Jakarta Post and Ibans. Nose kissing is also employed as a traditional greeting by Arab tribesmen when greeting members of the same tribe.

The British Middle East Command with troops from the United Kingdom, South Africa, British India, Uganda Protectorate, Kenya, Somaliland, West Africa, Northern and Southern Rhodesia, Sudan and Nyasaland participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied of Belgian Congo, Imperial Ethiopian Arbegnoch (resistance forces) and a small unit of Free French. Italian East Africa was defended by the (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the (Royal Army), (Royal Air Force) and (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and NCOs. With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began. On 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF at Wajir in Kenya and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the Battle of Gondar in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a guerrilla war in Ethiopia against the British until the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the Western Desert Campaign. Background =Italian East Africa= On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed the formation of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, AOI), from Ethiopia after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and the colonies of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during the Second World War but the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to invasion but (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of Africa.  Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, was appointed Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI in November 1937, with a headquarters in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel). By 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to On 10 June, the Italian army was organised in four commands: * Northern Sector, vicinity of Asmara ** Eritrea, Lieutenant-General Luigi Frusci * Southern Sector, around Jimma ** Ethiopia, General Pietro Gazzera * Eastern Sector, General Guglielmo Nasi (borders of French and British Somaliland) * Giuba Sector, Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone, southern Somalia near Kismayo, Italian Somaliland Aosta had two metropolitan divisions, the 40th Infantry Division \\"Cacciatori d'Africa\\" and the 65th Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Savoia\\", a battalion of (elite mountain troops), a battalion of motorised infantry, several Blackshirt battalions and smaller units. About 70 per cent of Italian troops were locally recruited Askari. The regular Eritrean battalions and the (RCTC Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry (Falcon Feathers). (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali Dubats from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with Shifta, marauders who plundered and murdered at will. Once Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company was formed from German residents of East Africa and stranded German sailors. Italian forces in East Africa were equipped with about machine-guns, 24 M11/39 medium tanks, 39 L3/35 tankettes, and twenty-four anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one and The Italians had little opportunity for reinforcement or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition. On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German merchant raiders in the Indian Ocean were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. On 22 November 1940 the Yugoslav steamer Durmitor, captured by the German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis, put in at Warsheikh with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.  The (CAAOI) of the (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts, * (Air Sector Headquarters North) * (Air Sector Headquarters West) * (Air Sector Headquarters South) In June 1940, there were in the AOI, in squadrons with comprising with six aircraft each, six Caproni Ca.133 light bomber squadrons, seven Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 squadrons and two squadrons of Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s. Four fighter squadrons had , comprising two nine-aircraft Fiat CR.32 squadrons and two nine-aircraft Fiat CR.42 squadrons; CAAOI had one reconnaissance squadron with nine IMAM Ro.37 aircraft. There were aircraft and another reserve, of which operational and unserviceable. On the outbreak of war, the CAAOI had of aviation fuel, of bombs and of ammunition. Aircraft and engine maintenance was conducted at the main air bases and at the Caproni and Piaggio workshops, which could repair about fifteen seriously-damaged aircraft and engines each month, along with some moderately and lightly damaged aircraft and could also recycle scarce materials. The Italians had reserves for 75 per cent of their front-line strength but lacked spare parts and many aircraft were cannibalised to keep others operational. The quality of the units varied. The SM.79 was the only modern bomber and the CR.32 fighter was obsolete but the in East Africa had a cadre of highly experienced Spanish Civil War veterans. There was the nucleus of a transport fleet, with nine Savoia-Marchetti S.73, nine Ca.133, six Ca.148 (a lengthened version of the Ca.133) and a Fokker F.VII, which maintained internal communications and carried urgent items and personnel between sectors.  From 1935 to 1940 the (Italian Royal Navy) laid plans for an ocean-going \\"escape fleet\\" () equipped for service in the tropics. The plans varied from three battleships, an aircraft carrier, twelve cruisers, 36 destroyers and 30 submarines to a more realistic two cruisers, eight destroyers and twelve submarines. Even the lower establishment proved too expensive and in 1940 the Red Sea Flotilla had seven ageing fleet destroyers, the 5th Destroyer Division with the Leone-class destroyers Pantera, Leone and Tigre and the 3rd Destroyer Division with the Sauro-class destroyers Cesare Battisti, Francesco Nullo, Nazario Sauro and Daniele Manin. There were two old local defence destroyers (torpedo boats) Orsini and Acerbi, a squadron of five first world war Motoscafo Armato Silurante (MAS, motor torpedo boats). The Flotilla had eight modern submarines (Archimede, Galileo Ferraris, Galileo Galilei, Evangelista Torricelli, Luigi Galvani, Guglielmotti, Macall√© and Perla). The flotilla was based at Massawa in Eritrea on the Red Sea. The port linked Axis-occupied Europe and the naval facilities in the Italian concession zone at Tientsin in China. There were limited port facilities at Assab, in Eritrea and at Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland. When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea. The finite resources in Italian East Africa were intended to last for a war of about six months' duration, the submarines denying the Red Sea route to the British. =Mediterranean and Middle East= The British had based forces in Egypt since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. A small British and Commonwealth force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, over the Mediterranean and Middle East theatres. Wavell was responsible for the defence of Egypt through the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Troops Egypt, to train the Egyptian army and co-ordinate military operations with the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean, Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, Vice-Admiral Ralph Leatham, the Commander-in- Chief India, General Robert Cassels, the Inspector General, African Colonial Forces, Major-General Douglas Dickinson and the Air Officer Commanding-in- Chief Middle East, Air Chief Marshal William Mitchell. (French divisions in Tunisia faced the Italian 5th Army on the western Libyan border, until the Franco-Axis Armistice of 22 June 1940.) In Libya, the Regio Esercito Italiana (Royal Italian Army) had about and in Egypt, the British had about with another training in Palestine. Wavell had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa. =Middle East Command= Middle East Command was established before the war to control land operations and co- ordinate with the naval and air commands in the Mediterranean and Middle East, although Wavell was only allowed five staff officers for plans and command of an area of . From 1940 to 1941, operations took place in the Western Desert of Egypt, East Africa, Greece and the Middle East. In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy. After Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \\"static policy\\". Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie at Khartoum. Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with Selassie, the South African General Jan Smuts (advisor to Winston Churchill), Wavell, Lieutenant-General William Platt and Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed. In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the Government Code and Cypher School (GC & CS) at Bletchley Park broke the high grade cypher of the Italian army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the Regia Aeronautica was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME). In September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the Western Desert campaign and re- open the land route from Cape Town to Cairo. East Africa Force In 1940, East Africa Force (Major-General D. P. Dickinson) was established for North East Africa, East Africa and British Central Africa. In Sudan about and guarded a frontier with the AOI. Platt had 21 companies (4,500 men) of the Sudan Defence Force (SDF), of which five (later six) were organised as motor machine-gun companies. There was no artillery but the Sudan Horse was converting to a 3.7-inch mountain howitzer battery. The 1st Battalion Worcestershire Regiment, 1st Battalion Essex Regiment and the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment, were, in mid-September, incorporated into the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade, 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and 9th Indian Infantry Brigade respectively of the 5th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Lewis Heath) when it arrived. The 4th Indian Infantry Division (Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse) was transferred from Egypt in December. The British had an assortment of armoured cars and B Squadron 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4th RTR) with Matilda infantry tanks joined the 4th Indian Division in January 1941. On the outbreak of hostilities, Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater in British Somaliland had about comprising the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) and a battalion of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment. By August, the 1/2nd Punjab and 3/5th Punjab regiments had been transferred from Aden and 2nd Battalion KAR with the 1st East African Light Battery (3.7-inch howitzers) came from Kenya, raising the total to in the first week of August. In the Aden Protectorate, British Forces Aden (Air Vice-Marshal George Reid) had a garrison of the two Indian infantry battalions until they were transferred to British Somaliland in August. Ethiopia In August 1939, Wavell had ordered a plan covertly to encourage the rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, that the Italians had never been able to repress. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the policy of appeasement. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance. In June 1940, Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch (Amharic for Patriots). Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy. The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from √©migr√© volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres consisting of an officer, five NCOs and several picked Ethiopians were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare to provide leadership cadres and ¬£1 million was set aside to finance operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the HQ of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the RAF managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the Arbegnoch north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma‚ÄìGondar road and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941. Northern front, 1940 =British Somaliland 1940= On 3 August 1940, the Italians invaded with two colonial brigades, four cavalry squadrons, tanks and L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, batteries, pack artillery and air support. The British had a garrison of two companies of the Sudan Defence Force, two motor machine-gun companies and a mounted infantry company. Kassala was bombed and then attacked, the British retiring slowly. On 4 August, the Italians advanced with a western column towards Zeila, a central column (Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone) towards Hargeisa and an eastern column towards Odweina in the south. The SCC skirmished with the advancing Italians as the main British force slowly retired. On 5 August, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were captured, cutting off the British from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns joined. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen was diverted to Berbera, en route to Kenya to take command as reinforcements increased the British garrison to five battalions. (From 5 to 19 August, RAF squadrons based at Aden flew 184 sorties, dropped of bombs, lost seven aircraft destroyed and ten damaged.)  Battle of Tug Argan  On 11 August, the Italians began the Battle of Tug Argan (, a dry, sandy riverbed), where the road from Hargeisa crosses the Assa hills and by 14 August, the British were at risk of defeat in detail by the larger Italian force and its greater quantity of artillery. Close to being cut off and with only one battalion left in reserve, Godwin-Austen contacted Henry Maitland Wilson the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the British Troops in Egypt in Cairo (Wavell was in London) and received permission to withdraw from the colony. The 2nd Battalion, Black Watch, supported by two companies of the 2nd King's African Rifles and parties of the 1st/2nd Punjab Regiment covered the retreat of the British contingent to Berbera. By on 18 August, most of the contingent had been evacuated to Aden but and the HQ stayed behind until morning before sailing and the Italians entered Berbera on the evening of 19 August. In the final four days, the RAF flew twelve reconnaissance and sorties, with on Italian transport and troop columns; sorties were flown over Berbera. The British suffered casualties of and the Italians suffered fuel and ammunition expenditure and wear and tear on vehicles was difficult to remedy, which forced the Italians to return to the defensive. Churchill criticised Wavell for abandoning the colony without enough fighting but Wavell called it a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. =Anglo-Egyptian Sudan= Anglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a border with the AOI and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at Kassala. The Italians forced the British garrison of of the SDF and some local police to retire after inflicting casualties of and for ten casualties of their own. The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at Gallabat, just over the border from Metemma, about south of Kassala and took the villages of QaysƒÅn, Kurmuk and Dumbode on the Blue Nile. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan owing to a lack of fuel and fortified Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strongpoints, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find little anti-British sentiment among the Sudanese population. The 5th Indian Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940. The 29th Indian Infantry Brigade were placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade was based south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade (William Slim) were sent to Gedaref, with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of . Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance. Gallabat fort lay in Sudan and Metemma a short way across the Ethiopian border, beyond the Boundary Khor, a dry riverbed with steep banks covered by long grass. Both places were surrounded by field fortifications and Gallabat was held by a colonial infantry battalion. Metemma had two colonial battalions and a banda formation, all under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Castagnola. The 10th Indian Infantry Brigade, a field artillery regiment, B Squadron, 4th RTR with six Infantry and six light tanks, attacked Gallabat on 6 November at An RAF contingent of six Wellesley bombers and nine Gloster Gladiator fighters, were thought sufficient to overcome the fighters and believed to be in range. The infantry assembled from Gallabat, whose garrison was unaware that an attack was coming, until the RAF bombed the fort and put the wireless out of action. The field artillery began a simultaneous bombardment; after an hour the gunners changed targets and bombarded Metemma. The previous night, the 4th Battalion 10th Baluch Regiment occupied a hill overlooking the fort as a flank guard. The troops on the hill covered the advance at of the 3rd Royal Garwhal Rifles followed by the tanks. The Indians reached Gallabat and fought hand-to-hand with the 65th Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Savoia\\" and some Eritrean troops in the fort. At the 25th and 77th Colonial battalions counter-attacked and were repulsed but three British tanks were knocked out by mines and six by mechanical failure caused by the rocky ground. The defenders at Boundary Khor were dug in behind fields of barbed wire and Castagnola had contacted Gondar for air support. Italian bombers and fighters attacked all day, shot down seven Gladiators for a loss of five Fiat CR-42s and destroyed the lorry carrying spare parts for the tanks. The ground was so hard and rocky that there were no trenches and when Italian bombers made their biggest attack, the infantry had no cover. An ammunition lorry was set on fire by burning grass and the sound was taken to be an Italian counter-attack from behind. When a platoon advanced towards the sound with fixed bayonets, some troops thought that they were retreating. Part of the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at the fort broke and ran, taking some of the Gahrwalis with them. Many of the British fugitives mounted their transport and drove off, spreading the panic and some of the runaways reached Doka before being stopped. The Italian bombers returned next morning and Slim ordered a withdrawal from Gallabat Ridge west to less exposed ground that evening. Sappers from the 21st Field Company remained behind to demolish the remaining buildings and stores in the fort. The artillery bombarded Gallabat and Metemma and set off Italian ammunition dumps full of pyrotechnics. British casualties since 6 November were killed and The brigade patrolled to deny the fort to the Italians and on 9 November, two Baluch companies attacked and held the fort during the day and retired in the evening. During the night an Italian counter-attack was repulsed by artillery-fire and next morning the British re-occupied the fort unopposed. Ambushes were laid and prevented Italian reinforcements from occupying the fort or the hills on the flanks, despite frequent bombing by the . Southern front, 1940 =British East Africa (Kenya)= On the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Dickinson had a force of two East African brigades of the King's African Rifles (KAR) organised as a Northern Brigade and a Southern Brigade comprising a reconnaissance regiment, a light artillery battery and the 22nd Mountain Battery Royal Indian Artillery (RIA). By March 1940, the KAR strength had reached 883 officers, 1,374 non-commissioned officers and 20,026 African other ranks. Wavell ordered Dickinson to defend Kenya and to pin down as many Italian troops as possible. Dickinson planned to defend Mombasa with the 1st East African Infantry Brigade and to deny a crossing of the Tana River and the fresh water at Wajir, with the 2nd East African Infantry Brigade. Detachments were to be placed at Marsabit, Moyale, and at Turkana near Lake Rudolf (now Lake Turkana), an arc of . The Italians were thought to have troops at Kismayu, Mogadishu, Dolo, Moyale and Yavello, which turned out to be colonial troops and bande, with two brigades at Jimma, ready to reinforce Moyale or attack Lake Rudolf and then invade Uganda. By the end of July, the 3rd East African Infantry Brigade and the 6th East African Infantry Brigade had been formed. A Coastal Division and a Northern Frontier District Division had been planned but then the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division were created instead. On 1 June, the first South African unit arrived in Mombasa, Kenya and by the end of July, the 1st South African Infantry Brigade Group had arrived. On 13 August, the 1st South African Division was formed and by the end of 1940, about 27,000 South Africans were in East Africa, in the 1st South African Division, the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division. Each South African brigade group consisted of three rifle battalions, an armoured car company and signal, engineer and medical units. By July, under the terms of a war contingency plan, the 2nd (West Africa) Infantry Brigade, from the Gold Coast (Ghana) and the 1st (West Africa) Infantry Brigade from Nigeria, were provided for service in Kenya by the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF). The 1st (West African) Brigade, the two KAR brigades and some South African units, formed the 11th (African) Division. The 12th (African) Division had a similar formation with the 2nd (West African) Brigade. At dawn on 17 June, the Rhodesians supported a raid by the SDF on the Italian desert outpost of El Wak in Italian Somaliland about north- east of Wajir. The Rhodesians bombed and burnt down thatched mud huts and generally harassed the enemy troops. Since the main fighting at that time was against Italian advances towards Moyale in Kenya, the Rhodesians concentrated there. On 1 July, an Italian attack on the border town of Moyale, on the edge of the Ethiopian escarpment, where the tracks towards Wajir and Marsabit meet, was repulsed by a company of the 1st KAR and reinforcements were moved up. The Italians carried out a larger attack by about four battalions on 10 July, after a considerable artillery bombardment and after three days the British withdrew unopposed. The Italians eventually advanced to water holes at Dabel and Buna, nearly inside Kenya but lack of supplies prevented a further advance. =Italian strategy, December 1940= After the conquest of British Somaliland the Italians adopted a more defensive posture. In late 1940, Italian forces suffered defeats in the Mediterranean, the Western Desert, the Battle of Britain and in the Greco-Italian War. This prompted General Ugo Cavallero, the new Italian Chief of the General Staff in Rome, to adopt a new strategy in East Africa. In December 1940, Cavallero thought that Italian forces in East Africa should abandon offensive actions against the Sudan and the Suez Canal and concentrate on the defence of the AOI. In response to Cavallero and Aosta, who had requested permission to withdraw from the Sudanese frontier, Comando Supremo ordered Italian forces in East Africa to withdraw to better defensive positions. Frusci was ordered to withdraw from Kassala and Metemma in the lowlands along the Sudan‚ÄìEritrea border and hold the more easily defended mountain passes on the Kassala‚ÄìAgordat and Metemma‚ÄìGondar roads. Frusci chose not to withdraw from the lowlands, because withdrawal would involve too great a loss of prestige and because Kassala was an important railway junction; holding it prevented the British from using the railway to carry supplies from Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast to the base at Gedaref. Information on the Italian withdrawal was quickly decrypted by the British and Platt was able to begin his offensive into Eritrea on 18 January 1941, three weeks ahead of schedule. =War in the air= In Sudan, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Air Headquarters Sudan (Headquarters 203 Group from 17 August, Air Headquarters East Africa from 19 October), subordinate to the AOC-in-C Middle East, had 14 Squadron, 47 Squadron and 223 Squadron (Wellesley bombers). A flight of Vickers Vincent biplanes from 47 Squadron performed Army Co-operation duties and were later reinforced from Egypt by 45 squadron (Bristol Blenheims). Six Gladiator biplane fighters were based in Port Sudan for trade protection and anti-submarine patrols over the Red Sea, the air defence of Port Sudan, Atbara and Khartoum and army support. In May, 1 (Fighter) Squadron South African Air Force (SAAF) arrived, was transferred to Egypt to cvt to Gladiators and returned to Khartoum in August. The SAAF in Kenya had 12 Squadron SAAF (Junkers Ju 86 bombers), 11 Squadron SAAF (Fairey Battle bombers), 40 Squadron SAAF (Hawker Hartebeest), 2 Squadron SAAF (Hawker Fury fighters) and 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron (Hawker Hardy general-purpose aircraft). Better aircraft became available later but the first aircraft were old and slow, the South Africans even pressing an old Vickers Valentia biplane into service as a bomber. The South Africans faced experienced Italian pilots, including a cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans. Despite its lack of experience, 1 SAAF claimed 48 enemy aircraft destroyed and 57 damaged in the skies over East Africa. A further 57 were claimed destroyed on the ground; all for the loss of six pilots‚Äîit is thought the unit was guilty of severe over- claiming. From November 1940 to early January 1941, Platt continued to apply constant pressure on the Italians along the Sudan‚ÄìEthiopia border with patrols and raids by ground troops and aircraft. Hawker Hurricanes and more Gloster Gladiators began to replace some of the older models. On 6 December, a large concentration of Italian motor transport was bombed and strafed by Commonwealth aircraft a few miles north of Kassala. The same aircraft then proceeded to machine-gun from low level the nearby positions of the Italian Blackshirts and colonial infantry. A few days later, the same aircraft bombed the Italian base at Keru, fifty miles east of Kassala. The Commonwealth pilots had the satisfaction of seeing supply dumps, stores and transport enveloped in flame and smoke as they flew away. One morning in mid-December, a force of Italian fighters strafed a Rhodesian landing-strip at Wajir near Kassala, where two Hawker Hardys were caught on the ground and destroyed and of fuel were set alight, four Africans were killed and eleven injured fighting the fire. =War at sea, 1940= The approaches to the Red Sea through the Gulf of Aden and the Strait (Gate of Tears) is wide. With the Italy declaration of war on 10 June and the loss of French naval support in the Mediterranean after the Armistice, the Red Sea passage to Suez became the main British sea route to the Middle East. South of Suez the British held Port Sudan, about halfway down on the Sudan coast and the base at Aden, east of Bab-el-Mandeb on the Arabian Peninsula. The principal Italian naval force ( [Rear-Admiral] Mario Bonetti) was based at Massawa in Eritrea, about north of the Bab-el-Mandeb, well placed for the Red Sea Flotilla to attack Allied convoys. British code-breakers of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) at Bletchley Park in England, deciphered Italian orders of 19 May, coded using C38m machines, secretly to mobilise the army and air force in East Africa. Merchant traffic was stopped by the British on 24 May, pending the introduction of a convoy system. The Red Sea Force (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Murray), operational at Aden since April with the light cruisers and (Liverpool was replaced by ), was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser , which sailed south with Convoy BS 4, the 28th Destroyer Flotilla comprising , Kimberley, and and three sloops from the Mediterranean. The force was to conduct a blockade Italian East Africa (Operation Begum), attack the Red Sea Flotilla and protect the sea lanes from Aden to Suez. On 6 June, the Azio-class minelayer Ostia used 470 mines to lay eight barrages off Massawa and the destroyer Pantera dropped 110 mines in two barrages off Assab the day after. When Italy declared war on 10 June, Galileo Ferraris sailed for French Somaliland (Djibouti), Galileo Galilei to Aden, Galvani to the Gulf of Oman and Mecall√© to Port Sudan. On 14 June Evangelista Torricelli put to sea to relieve Galileo Ferraris whose crew had been incapacitated by chloromethane poisoning from the refrigeration system. The crew of Macall√© was also afflicted; the boat was run aground and lost on 15 June. On 18 June, Galileo Galilei boarded and released the neutral Yugoslav steamship Dravo and the next day engaged the armed trawler off Aden. All but one officer was killed by shell-fire and the boat was captured along with many documents including the orders for four more Italian submarines. Archimede, Perla and Guglielmotti sailed from 19 to 21 June. On 26 June, Guglielmotti ran onto a shoal and suffered severe damage; the wreck was salvaged later. Documents recovered from Galileo Galilei were used to intercept and damage Evangelista Torricelli on 21 June. The submarine headed for home but was caught off Perim Island and sunk by Kandahar, Kingston, Khartoum and the sloop . Several hours afterwards, a torpedo on Khartoum, damaged by a shell from Evangelista Torricelli, exploded and caused an uncontrollable fire. Khartoum tried to reach Perim Harbour about distant but the crew and prisoners had to abandon ship; later a magazine explosion wrecked the vessel. The sloop Falmouth exploited the document find from Galileo Galilei to sink Luigi Galvani in the Gulf of Oman on 24 June. On 13 August, Galileo Ferraris made an abortive attempt to intercept the battleship en route from Suez to Aden. From 13 to 19 August Kimberley and the sloop bombarded Italian troops advancing west of Berbera in British Somaliland. Italian air raids on Berbera caused splinter damage to Hobart as it participated in the evacuation of Berbera with Carlisle, Ceres, Kandahar, Kimberley and the sloops Shoreham, , Auckland, auxiliary cruisers Chakdina, Chantala and Laom√©don, the transport and the hospital ship , lifting 5,960 troops, 1,266 civilians and 184 sick and wounded. On 18 November the cruiser bombarded Zante in Italian Somaliland British naval forces supported land operations and blockaded the remnants the Red Sea Flotilla at Massawa. By the end of 1940, the British had gained control of East African coastal routes and the Red Sea; Italian forces in the AOI declined as fuel, spare parts and supplies from Italy ran out. There were six Italian air attacks on convoys in October and none after 4 November. Red Sea convoys During 16 June 1940, Galileo Galilei sank the Norwegian tanker James Stove (8,215 Gross register tonnage (GRT), sailing independently about south of Aden. On 2 July the first of the BN convoys, comprising six tankers and three freighters, assembled in the Gulf of Aden. Italian sorties against the BN‚ÄìBS convoys were dispiriting failures; from 26 to 31 July, Guglielmotti failed to find two Greek merchantmen and a sortie by the torpedo boats Cesare Battisti and Francesco Nullo was also abortive. Guglielmotti from 21 to 25 August, Galileo Ferraris (25‚Äì31 August), Francesco Nullo and Nazario Sauro from 24 to 25 August and the destroyers Pantera and Tigre (28‚Äì29 August) failed to find Greek ships in the Red Sea, despite agent reports and sightings by air reconnaissance. Italian aircraft and submarines had little more success. On the night of 5/6 September, Cesare Battisti, Daniele Manin and Nazario Sauro sailed, followed on 6/7 September by the destroyers Leone and Tigre to attack a northbound convoy (BN 4) found by air reconnaissance but found nothing. Further to the north, Galileo Ferraris and Guglielmotti also failed to find BN 4 but Guglielmotti torpedoed the Greek tanker Atlas (4,008 GRT) south of the Farasan Islands straggling behind the convoy. Leone, Pantera, Cesare Battisti and Daniele Manin with the submarines Archimede and Gugliemotti failed to find a convoy of 23 ships spotted by air reconnaissance. Bhima (5,280 GRT) in convoy BN 5 was damaged by bombs and one man killed; the ship was towed to Aden and beached. In August the British ran four convoys in each direction, five in September and seven in October, 86 ships in BN convoys and 72 in BS (southbound) convoys; the Regia Aeronautica managed only six air attacks in October and none after 4 November. The Attack on Convoy BN 7, took place from 20 to 21 October and was the only destroyer attack on a convoy, despite gaining precise information on BN convoys as they passed French Somaliland. The 31 ships of BN 7 were escorted by the cruiser Leander, the destroyer , the sloops Auckland, and with the minesweepers and , with air cover from Aden. Guglielmo Marconi and Galileo Ferraris, stationed to the north, failed to intercept the convoy but on 21 October the destroyers Nazario Sauro and Francesco Nullo with the destroyers Pantera, Leone attacked BN 7 east of Massawa; the attackers caused only superficial damage to one ship. Kimberley forced Francesco Nullo aground on an island near Massawa, at the Battle of Harmil Island on the morning of 21 October. Kimberley was hit in the engine room by a shore battery and had to be towed to Port Sudan by Leander. The wreck of Francesco Nullo was bombed on 21 October by three Blenheims of 45 Squadron. From 22 to 28 November, Archimede and Galileo Ferraris sailed to investigate reports of a convoy but found nothing, as did Tigre, Leone, Daniele Manin, Nazario Sauro and Galileo Ferraris from 3 to 5 December. From 12 to 22 December Archimede sailed twice after sighting reports of ships but both sorties came to nothing; Galileo Ferraris sortied off Port Sudan. from June to December the RAF escorted 54 BN and NB convoys from which one ship was sunk and one damaged by Italian aircraft. =French Somaliland 1940‚Äì1942= The governor of French Somaliland (now Djibouti), Brigadier- General Paul Legentilhomme had a garrison of seven battalions of Senegalese and Somali infantry, three batteries of field guns, four batteries of anti- aircraft guns, a company of light tanks, four companies of militia and irregulars, two platoons of the camel corps and an assortment of aircraft. After visiting from 8 to 13 January 1940, Wavell decided that Legentilhomme would command the military forces in both Somalilands should war with Italy come. In June, an Italian force was assembled to capture the port city of Djibouti, the main military base. After the fall of France in June, the neutralisation of Vichy French colonies allowed the Italians to concentrate on the more lightly defended British Somaliland. On 23 July, Legentilhomme was ousted by the pro-Vichy naval officer Pierre Nouailhetas and left on 5 August for Aden, to join the Free French. In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to \\"rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed\\". The Free French were to arrange a voluntary ralliement by propaganda (Operation Marie) and the British were to blockade the colony. Wavell considered that if British pressure was applied, a rally would appear to have been coerced. Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiating with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March. Northern front, 1941 =Operation Camilla= Operation Camilla was a deception concocted by Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, to deceive the Italians, making them believe that the British planned to re-conquer British Somaliland with the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, transferred from Egypt to Gedaref and Port Sudan. In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \\"Sibs\\" (sibilare, hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success. The plot backfired when the Italians began to evacuate British Somaliland instead of sending reinforcements. Troops were sent north into Eritrea, where the real attack was coming, instead of to the east. Part of the deception, with misleading wireless transmissions, did convince the Italians that two Australian divisions were in Kenya, which led the Italians to reinforce the wrong area. =Eritrea= In November 1940, Gazelle Force operated from the Gash river delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, where hill ranges from bound wide valleys and the rainfall makes the area malarial from July to October. On 11 December, Wavell ordered the 4th Indian Division to withdraw from Operation Compass in the Western Desert and move to Sudan. The transfer took until early January 1941 and Platt intended to begin the offensive on the northern front on 8 February, with a pincer attack on Kassala, by the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, less a brigade each. News of the Italian disaster in Egypt, the harassment by Gazelle Force and the activities of Mission 101 in Ethiopia, led to the Italians withdrawing their northern flank to Keru and Wachai and then on 18 January to retreat hurriedly from Kassala and Tessenei, the triangle of Keru, Biscia and Aicota. Wavell had ordered Platt to advance the offensive from March to 9 February and then to 19 January, when it seemed that Italian morale was crumbling. The withdrawal led Wavell to order a pursuit and the troops arriving at Port Sudan (Briggs Force) to attack at Karora and advance parallel to the coast, to meet the forces coming from the west. Battle of Agordat, Barentu Two roads joined at Agordat and went through to Keren, the only route to Asmara. The 4th Indian Division was sent along the road to Sabderat and Wachai, thence as far towards Keru as supplies allowed, with the Matilda Infantry tanks of B Squadron, 4th RTR to join from Egypt. The 5th Indian Division was to capture Aicota, ready to move east to Barentu or north- east to Biscia. Apart from air attacks the pursuit was not opposed until Keru Gorge, held by a rearguard of the 41st Colonial Brigade. The brigade retreated on the night of leaving General Ugo Fongoli, his staff and behind as prisoners. On 28 January, the 3/14th Punjab Regiment made a flanking move to Mt Cochen to the south and on 30 January, five Italian colonial battalions counter-attacked with mountain artillery support, forcing back the Indians. On the morning of 31 January the Indians attacked again and advanced towards the main road. The 5th Indian Brigade on the plain attacked with the Matildas, overran the Italians, knocked out several Italian tanks and cut the road to Keren. The 2nd Colonial Division retreated having lost 1,500 to 2,000 infantry, and several medium and light tanks. Barentu, held by nine battalions of the 2nd Colonial Division (about and about thirty-six dug in M11/39 tanks and armoured cars was attacked by 10th Indian Infantry Brigade from the north against a determined Italian defence, as the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade advanced from the west, slowed by demolitions and rearguards. On the night of 31 January/1 February, the Italians retreated along a track towards Tole and Arresa and on 8 February, abandoned vehicles were found by the pursuers. The Italians had taken to the hills, leaving the Tessenei‚ÄìAgordat road open. Battle of Keren On 12 January, Aosta had sent a regiment of the 65th Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia (General Amedeo Liberati) and three colonial brigades to Keren. The 4th and 5th Indian Infantry Divisions advanced eastwards from Agordat into the rolling countryside, which gradually increased in elevation towards the Keren Plateau, through the Ascidira Valley. There was an escarpment on the left and a spur rising to on the right of the road and the Italians were dug in on heights which dominated the massifs, ravines and mountains. The defensive positions had been surveyed before the war and chosen as the main defensive position to guard Asmara and the Eritrean highlands from an invasion from Sudan. On 15 March, after several days of bombing, the 4th Indian Division attacked on the north and west side of the road to capture ground on the left flank, ready for the 5th Indian Division to attack on the east side. The Indians met a determined defence and made limited progress but during the night the 5th Indian Division captured Fort Dologorodoc, above the valley. The Granatieri di Savoia and Alpini counter-attacked Dologorodoc seven times from 18 to 22 March but the attacks were costly failures. Wavell flew to Keren to assess the situation and on 15 March, watched with Platt as the Indians made a frontal attack up the road, ignoring the high ground on either side and broke through. Early on 27 March, Keren was captured after a battle lasting 53 days, for a British and Commonwealth loss of killed and Italian losses were and 9,000 Ascari killed and about 21,000 wounded. The Italians conducted a fighting withdrawal under air attack to Ad Teclesan, in a narrow valley on the Keren‚ÄìAsmara road, the last defensible position before Asmara. The defeat at Keren had shattered the morale of the Italian forces and when the British attacked early on 31 March, the position fell and prisoners and were taken; Asmara was declared an open town the next day and the British entered unopposed. =Massawa= Admiral Mario Bonetti, the commander of the Italian Red Sea Flotilla and the garrison at Massawa, had and about to defend the port. During the evening of 31 March, three of the last six destroyers at Massawa put to sea to raid the Gulf of Suez and then scuttle themselves. Leone ran aground and sank the next morning; the sortie was postponed and on 2 April the last five destroyers left to attack Port Sudan and then sink themselves. Heath telephoned Bonetti with an ultimatum to surrender and not block the harbour by scuttling ships. If this was refused, the British would leave Italian citizens in Eritrea and Ethiopia to fend for themselves. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group sent small forces towards Adowa and Adigrat and the rest advanced down the Massawa road, which declined by in . The Indians rendezvoused at Massawa with Briggs Force by 5 April, after it had cut across country. Bonetti was once again called upon to surrender but refused and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed by the Massawa garrison. A simultaneous attack on the west side by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron 4th RTR broke through. The Free French overran the defences in the south-west as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. In the afternoon, Bonetti surrendered and the Allied force took and The harbour was found to have been blocked by the scuttling of two large floating dry docks, ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north Naval Harbour, the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa‚ÄìAsmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port had come into use to supply the 5th Indian Infantry Division. The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea. On 11 April, the US President Franklin D. Roosevelt rescinded the status, under the Neutrality Acts, of the Red Sea as a combat zone, freeing US ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East. =Western Ethiopia, 1941= Gideon Force was a small British and African special forces unit, which acted as a Corps d'Elite amongst the Sudan Defence Force, Ethiopian regular forces and Arbegnoch (Patriots). At its peak, Orde Wingate led fifty officers, twenty British NCOs, Sudanese troops and trained Ethiopian regulars. He had a few mortars, no artillery and no air support, only intermittent bombing sorties. The force operated in the difficult country of Gojjam Province at the end of a long and tenuous supply-line, on which nearly all of its perished. Gideon Force and the Arbegnoch (Ethiopian Patriots) ejected the Italian forces under General Guglielmo Nasi, the conqueror of British Somaliland in six weeks and captured and troops, twelve guns, many machine- guns, rifles and ammunition and over animals. Gideon Force was disbanded on 1 June 1941, Wingate was returned to his substantive rank of Major and returned to Egypt, as did many of the troops of Gideon Force, who joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) of the Eighth Army. Addis Ababa While Debre Markos and Addis Derra were being captured, other Ethiopian Patriots under Ras Abebe Aregai consolidated themselves around Addis Ababa in preparation for Emperor Selassie's return. In response to the rapidly advancing British and Commonwealth forces and to the general uprising of Ethiopian Patriots, the Italians in Ethiopia retreated to the mountain fortresses of Gondar, Amba Alagi, Dessie and Gimma. After negotiations prompted by Wavell, Aosta ordered the governor, Agenore Frangipani, to surrender the city to forestall a massacre of Italian civilians, as had occurred in Dire Dawa. Ashamed of not being allowed by his superior to fight to the death in the old style, the Italian governor, General Agenore Frangipani, killed himself with poison the next day. On 6 April 1941, Addis Ababa was occupied by Wetherall, Pienaar and Fowkes escorted by East African armoured cars, who received the surrender of the city. The (Police of Italian Africa) stayed in the city to maintain order. Selassie made a formal entry to the city on 5 May. On 13 April, Cunningham sent a force under Brigadier Dan Pienaar comprising 1st South African Brigade and Campbell's Scouts (Ethiopian irregulars led by a British officer), to continue the northward advance and link up with Platt's forces advancing south. On 20 April, the South Africans captured Dessie on the main road north from Addis Ababa to Asmara, about south of Amba Alagi. In eight weeks the British had advanced from Tana to Mogadishu at a cost of 501 casualties and eight aircraft and had destroyed the bulk of the Italian air and land forces. From Debra Marqos, Wingate pursued the Italians and undertook a series of harrying actions. (In early May most of Gideon Force had to break off to provide a suitable escort for Hailie Selassie's formal entry into Addis Ababa.) By 18 May, Maraventano was dug in at Agibor, against a force of about including only soldiers ( the Frontier Battalion and the re-formed 2nd Ethiopian Battalion). Both sides were short of food, ammunition, water and medical supplies; Wingate attempted a ruse by sending a message to Maraventano telling of reinforcements due to arrive and that the imminent withdrawal of British troops would leave the Italian column at the mercy of the Patriots. Maraventano discussed the situation with the Italian headquarters in Gondar on 21 May and was given discretion to surrender, which took place on 23 May by and troops, and children and men and camp followers. Gideon Force was down to soldiers to make the formal guard of honour at the surrender, the rest being Patriots. Southern front, 1941 =Italian Somaliland= In January 1941, the Italians decided that the plains of Italian Somalia could not be defended. The 102nd Divisione Somala (General Adriano Santini) and bande (about retired to the lower Juba river and the 101st Divisione Somala (General Italo Carnevali) and bande (about to the upper Jube on the better defensive terrain of the mountains of Ethiopia. Cunningham encountered few Italians west of the Juba, only bande and a colonial battalion at Afmadu and troops at Kismayu, where the Juba River empties into the Indian Ocean. Against an expected six brigades and \\"six groups of native levies\\" holding the Juba for the Italians, Cunningham began Operation Canvas on 24 January, with four brigade groups from the 11th (African) Division and the 12th (African) Division. Afmadu was captured on 11 February and three days later, the port of Kismayu the first objective was captured. North of Kismayu and beyond the river was the main Italian position at Jelib. On 22 February, Jelib was attacked on both flanks and from the rear. The Italians were routed and 30,000 were killed, captured or dispersed in the bush. There was nothing to hinder a British advance of to Mogadishu, the capital and main port of Italian Somaliland. On 25 February 1941, the motorised 23rd Nigerian Brigade (11th (African) Division) advanced up the coast in three days and occupied the Somali capital of Mogadishu unopposed. The 12th (African) Division was ordered to advance on Bardera and Isha Baidoa but was held up because of the difficulty in using Kismayu as a supply base. The division pushed up the Juba River in Italian Somaliland towards the Ethiopian border town of Dolo. After a pause, caused by the lack of equipment to sweep Mogadishu harbour of British magnetic mines dropped earlier, the 11th (African) Division began a fighting pursuit of the retreating Italian forces north from Mogadishu on 1 March. The division pursued the Italians towards the Ogaden Plateau. By 17 March, the 11th (African) Division completed a 17-day dash along the Italian Strada Imperiale (Imperial Road) from Mogadishu to Jijiga in the Somali region of Ethiopia. By early March Cunningham's forces had captured most of Italian Somaliland and were advancing through Ethiopia towards the ultimate objective, Addis Ababa. On 26 March, Harar was captured and 572 prisoners taken, with 13 guns, the 23rd Nigerian Brigade having advanced nearly in 32 days. (On 29 March, Dire Dawa was occupied by South African troops, after Italian colonists appealed for help against deserters, who were committing atrocities.) =British Somaliland 1941= The operation to recapture British Somaliland began on 16 March 1941 from Aden, in the first successful Allied landing on a defended shore of the war. The Aden Striking Force of about was to be carried about from Aden by eight navy ships and civilian transports carrying heavy equipment. The troops were to be put ashore onto beaches inside reefs to the east and west of Berbera to secure the town and re-conquer the territory. Some doubts were expressed as to the feasibility of negotiating offshore reefs in the dark, when the town behind was blacked out but the risk was taken. On 16 March about north of the town and off shore, the force prepared to land as advanced parties searched for landing places. The 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and 3/15th Punjab Regiment Indian Army (which had been evacuated from the port in August 1940) and a Somali commando detachment, landed at Berbera from Force D (the cruisers and Caledon, the destroyers Kandahar and Kipling, auxiliary cruisers Chakdina and Chantala, Indian trawlers Netavati and Parvati, two transports and ML 109). When the Sikhs landed, the 70th Colonial Brigade \\"melted away\\". On 20 March, Hargeisa was captured and the next few months were spent mopping up. The Somaliland Camel Corps was re-founded in mid-April, to resume operations against local bandits. British forces advanced westwards into eastern Ethiopia and in late March, linked with forces from the Southern Front around Harar and Diredawa. Cunningham's forces could now be supplied efficiently through Berbera. Amba Alagi After the fall of Keren, Aosta retreated to Amba Alagi, an mountain that had been tunnelled for strong points, artillery positions and stores, inside a ring of similarly fortified peaks. British troops advancing from the south had captured Addis Ababa on 6 April. Wavell imposed a policy of avoiding big operations in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, that would impede the withdrawal of troops to Egypt. The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement. The main attack by the 5th Indian Division began on 4 May and made slow progress. On 10 May, the 1st South African Brigade arrived and completed the encirclement of the mountain. The Indian division attacked again on 13 May, with the South Africans attacking next day and forcing the Italians out of several defensive positions. Concerned about the care of his wounded and rumours of atrocities committed by the Arbegnoch, Aosta offered to surrender, provided that the Italians were granted the honours of war. On 19 May, Aosta and troops, marched past a guard of honour into captivity. =Southern Ethiopia= The East Africa Force on the southern front included the 1st South African Division (Major- General George Brink), the 11th (African) Division (Major-General H. E. de R. Wetherall) and the 12th (African) Division (Major-General A. R. Godwin-Austen) (The African divisions were composed of East African, South African, Nigerian and Ghanaian troops under British, Rhodesian and South African officers.) In January 1941, Cunningham decided to launch his first attacks across the Kenyan border directly into southern Ethiopia. Although he realised that the approaching wet season would preclude a direct advance this way to Addis Ababa, he hoped that this action would cause the Ethiopians in the south of the country to rise up in rebellion against the Italians (the plot proved abortive). Cunningham sent the 1st South African Division (composed of the 2nd and 5th South African and 21st East African brigades) and an independent East African brigade into the Galla-Sidamo Province. From 16 to 18 January 1941, they captured El Yibo and on 19 February, an advance force of the South African Division captured Jumbo. From 24 to 25 January, Cunningham's troops fought on the Turbi Road. The southern Ethiopia attack was stopped in mid- February by heavy rain, which made movement and maintenance of the force very difficult. From 1 February, they captured Gorai and El Gumu. On 2 February, they took Hobok. From 8 to 9 February, Banno was captured. On 15 February, the fighting was on the Yavello Road. The two South African Brigades then launched a double flanking movement on Mega. After a three-day battle in which many of the South Africans, equipped for tropical conditions, suffered from exposure because of the heavy rain and near freezing temperatures, they captured Mega on 18 February. Moyale, south-east of Mega on the border with Kenya, was occupied on 22 February by a patrol of Abyssinian irregular troops which had been attached to the South African Division. =War at sea, 1941= The success of Operation Begum in gaining control of the seas off East Africa eased the supply of the British land forces; ships on passage to and from the Mediterranean supplemented the Red Sea Force ships in offshore operations. The German ship sailed from Kisimayu in Italian Somaliland on 31 January and rendezvoused from 14 to 17 February with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer, the auxiliary cruiser Atlantis and three British ships taken as prizes. The carrier , en route to the Mediterranean to replace Illustrious, formed Force K with the cruiser and in Operation Breach on 2 February 1941, dispatched Fairey Albacores to mine Mogadishu harbour, bomb the ordnance depot, airfield, the railway station, petrol tanks at Ras Sip and the customs shed. The cruisers Shropshire, Ceres and Colombo blockaded Kisimayu and in the Red Sea, Pantera, Tigre and Leone based at Massawa in Eritrea made another fruitless sortie. Leatham formed Force T with the carrier , the cruisers Shropshire, Hawkins, Capetown and Ceres, with the destroyer Kandahar to support Operation Canvas, the invasion of Italian Somaliland from Kenya. About fifty Italian and German merchant ships had been stranded at Massawa and Kisimayu on the outbreak of war and few were seaworthy by the time of the British invasion of the AOI but about twelve ships made the attempt. On the night of 10/11 February, eight Italian and two German ships sailed from Kisimayu for Mogadishu or Diego Suarez (now Antsiranana) in Madagascar. Three Italian ships were scuttled in Kisimayu on 12 February as British troops reached the vicinity of the port which was captured with the support of Shropshire two days later. Five of the Italian ships were spotted by aircraft from Hermes and captured by Hawkins, the German ship Uckermark was scuttled. The German Askari and Italian ship Pensilvania were seen off Mogadishu and destroyed by bombs and gunfire; two of the Italian ships reached Madagascar. While waiting for mines in the Suez canal to be swept, Formidable conducted Operation Composition on the night of 12/13 February, sending 14 Albacores to attack Massawa, half with bombs, half with torpedoes. The attack was disorganised by low cloud, SS Monacalieri (5,723 GRT) was sunk but little more was achieved. On 13 February, Hermes attacked Kismayu with Swordfish aircraft and the cruiser bombarded coastal defences, supply dumps and Italian troops. The Walrus aircraft on Shropshire attacked Brava and Italian bombers claimed a near miss on one of the British ships. When Kismayu was captured on 14 February, fifteen of the sixteen Axis merchant ships in the harbour were captured. In the Red Sea, the carrier Formidable conducted Operation Composition while en route to Suez; its 14 FAA Albacores attacked Massawa on 13 February and sank the merchant ship Moncaliere (5,723 GRT) and inflicted slight damage on other ships The colonial ship Eritrea escaped from Massawa on 18 February and on 21 February, Formidable sent seven Albacores to dive-bomb the harbour; four were hit by anti-aircraft fire but all returned. During the night the auxiliary cruiser Ramb I (3,667 GRT) and the German Coburg (7,400 GRT) departed, followed by Ramb II on 22 February. On 27 February, Ramb I was caught by Leander sunk north of the Maldive Islands; Eritrea and Ramb II escaped and reached Kobe, Japan. On 25 February, Mogadishu fell and British merchant sailors, taken prisoner by German commerce-raiders, were liberated. On 1 March, five Albacores from Formidable flying from a landing ground at Mersa Taclai raided Massawa again but caused little damage. MS Himalaya (6,240 GRT) departed on 1 March and reached Rio de Janeiro on 4 April. On 4 March Coburg, with a captured tanker, Ketty Brovig (7,031 GRT) were spotted by an aircraft flown from Canberra south-east of the Seychelles; when Canberra and Leander approached, the Axis crews scuttled their ships. From 1 to 4 March, the submarines Guglielmo Marconi, Galileo Ferraras, Perla and Archimede sailed from Massawa for BETASOM the Italian submarine flotilla operating in the Atlantic at Bordeaux. The boats arrived from 7 to 20 May after taking on supplies from German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic. On 16 March Force D from Aden conducted Operation Appearance a landing at Berbera and the beginning of the re-conquest of British Somaliland. The Axis ships Oder (8,516 GRT) and India (6,366 GRT) sailed from Massawa on 23 March but Shoreham caught up with Oder at the Straits of Perim, the western channel of the Bab-el-Mandeb and the crew scuttled the ship; India took refuge in Assab. Bertrand Rickmers (4,188 GRT) tried to break out on 29 March but was intercepted by Kandahar and scuttled; Piave set out on 30 March but only got as far as Assab. On 31 March, three of the Italian destroyers at Massawa sortied against shipping in the Gulf of Suez. Leone ran aground outside Massawa and had to be sunk, after which the sortie was abandoned. departed on 1 April but was forced to turn back. On 2 April, the five remaining Italian destroyers were due to attack the fuel tanks at Port Sudan and then scuttle themselves but RAF reconnaissance aircraft from Aden spotted the ships. While was waiting to pass from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean, 813 Naval Air Squadron and 824 Naval Air Squadron, with 17 Swordfish torpedo bombers were flown to Port Sudan. On 2 April two Swordfish bombed a freighter at Merca and at dawn on 3 April, a search by six of the Swordfish began at At another Swordfish spotted four Italian destroyers east of Port Sudan. Three of the Swordfish on patrol were called in and the four aircraft bombed, achieving several near misses with bombs. One Swordfish remained to shadow the ships as the others returned to rearm and at seven Swordfish attacked, one aircraft from the rear and one from each side of each target. Nazario Sauro was hit by all six bombs from one Swordfish and quickly sank; casualties were caused to the other three ships by near-misses. Five Blenheims of 14 Squadron RAF arrived in time to see Nazario Sauro hit and attacked a stationary destroyer and reported that its crew abandoned ship, that it was set on fire, exploded and sank but Cesare Battisti was later found beached on the Arabian coast. At another four Swordfish found the Italian destroyers distant. Daniele Manin was hit amidships by two bombs and the crew abandoned ship; three Swordfish obtained near misses. The last two destroyers were shadowed until they were out of range. Pantera and Tigre were found south of Jeddah where they were being abandoned. Blenheims of 14 Squadron and Wellesleys of 223 Squadron from Port Sudan claimed hits on both ships, one catching fire. The destroyer Kingston completed the destruction of the ships. Vincenzo Orsini which had run aground at Massawa managed to refloat and was scuttled in the harbour on 8 April after being bombed by the Swordfish of 813 NAS; the torpedo boat Giovanni Acerbi was also sunk by aircraft. On 7 April, before being scuttled, the antiquated MAS-213 (MAS, motor torpedo boat) a survivor of the Great War, torpedoed the cruiser as it escorted minesweepers off Massawa. Capetown was towed to Port Sudan, eventually to sail for Bombay where it was under repair for a year, then relegated to an accommodation ship. Operations, May‚ÄìNovember 1941 =Assab= After the surrender by Aosta at Amba Alagi on 18 May 1941, some Italian forces held out at Assab, the last Italian harbour on the Red Sea. Operation Chronometer took place from 10 to 11 June, with a surprise landing at Assab by the 3/15th Punjab Regiment from Aden, carried by a flotilla comprising , Indus, , and SS Tuna. Dido bombarded the shore from ; aircraft flew overhead and bombed the port to drown the sound of two motor-boats carrying thirty soldiers each. At the troops disembarked on the pier unopposed; two Italian generals, one being Pietro Piacentini, the commander of , were taken prisoner in their beds and the success signal was fired at The flotilla entered the harbour behind a minesweeper and landed the rest of the Punjabis, who sent parties to search the islands nearby and found them to be unoccupied. At the Civil Governor was taken to Dido and surrendered Assab to the Senior Officer Red Sea Force (Rear-Admiral Ronald Halifax) and the army commander, Brigadier Harry Dimoline. During the evening, Captain Bolla, the Senior Naval Officer at Assab, was captured. Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and told the British that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took in the operation along with the two generals and On 13 June, the Indian trawler Parvati struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign. =Kulkaber (Culqualber)= A force under General Pietro Gazzera, the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of Arbegnoch and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the Free Belgian forces (Major-General Auguste Gilliaert) who had defeated the Italians at Asosa and Sa√Øo. On 6 July, Gazzera and and formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda. Wolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about . The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with and soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W. A. L. James). Work began to repair the road to Gondar during the autumn rains. =Battle of Gondar= Gondar, the capital of Begemder Province in north-west Ethiopia, was about west of Amba Alagi. After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the Regia Aeronautica in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end. After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last Regia Aeronautica sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA. On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender. On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with and troops, British losses being killed, six men missing and shot down since 7 April. In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of and and wounded. Aftermath =Analysis= In 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War. In 2004, the American historian Douglas Porch wrote that the \\"pearl of the fascist regime\\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \\"stunning\\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May. Ethiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons. The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \\"deficiency of the Italian race\\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East. With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of Axis forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources. =Signals intelligence= The Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS; in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new and ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the and on the retreat from Keren. On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that =Casualties= On 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that had been killed, and during military operations before the surrender. Casualties among NCOs and other ranks were and (inclusive). Casualties among locally recruited soldiers were and before the surrender; the figures did not include forces on the Giuba and eastern fronts. By May 1941, of the men in the AOI available for military operations in June 1940, only the in the garrisons near Gondar and the seven colonial divisions in Galla-Sidamo remained to be taken prisoner. More casualties among the Italian and colonial troops occurred after April 1941, in the operations against Amba Alagi (3,500 casualties), Kulkaber/Culqualber (1,003 killed and 804 wounded) and Gondar (4,000 killed and 8,400 sick and wounded). In 1959, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that from June 1940 to May 1941, the East African Force had casualties and or accident cases, including and cases of which fatal. The RAF lost ; the Free French Flight N¬∞ 1 lost two Martin Marylands. The lost the in the AOI when the war began and the to the region during the campaign. The Belgian suffered from all causes. =Subsequent operations= Guerrilla warfare Until 27 November 1941, two African divisions mopped up pockets of resistance until the last formed Italian units surrendered. From the end of 1941 to September 1943, men in scattered Italian units fought a guerrilla war from the deserts of Eritrea and Somalia to the forests and mountains of Ethiopia. They supposedly did so in the hope of holding out until the Germans and Italians in Egypt (or even possibly the Japanese in India) intervened. Amedeo Guillet was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was Hamid Idris Awate, a father of the Eritrean Liberation Front. Other Italian officers were Captain Francesco De Martini in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \\"blackshirt centurion\\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. Rosa Dainelli sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa. Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the Armistice with Italy. Some three thousand Italian soldiers continued the guerrilla war until October 1943, as they were unaware of the agreement when Italy surrendered to the Allies. Post- war In January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. Makonnen Endelkachew was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as protectorates. In November 1949, the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years. British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, the Trust Territory of Somalia (ex- Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the Somali Republic.

As king, he is known chiefly for his opposition to the co-ruling Spartan king, Cleomenes I. He later fled to Achaemenid Persia where he was given asylum and land, and fought on the Persian side during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. Biography When Cleomenes attempted to make Isagoras tyrant in Athens, Demaratus tried unsuccessfully to frustrate his plans. In 491 BC, Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (earth and water) to Persia. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of medism, and Cleomenes I crossed over to the island to arrest those responsible. His first attempt was unsuccessful, due to interference from Demaratus, who did his utmost to bring Cleomenes into disfavour at home. In retaliation, Cleomenes urged Leotychidas, a relative and personal enemy of Demaratus, to claim the throne on the grounds that the latter was not really the son of Ariston, but of Agetus, his mother's first husband. Cleomenes bribed the Delphic oracle to pronounce in favour of Leotychidas, who became king in 491 BC. After the deposition of Demaratus, Cleomenes visited the island of Aegina for a second time, accompanied by his new colleague Leotychides, seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.

Laureate head of Apollo left / Head of Prokles right, wearing Persian headdress. On his abdication, Demaratus was forced to flee. He went to the court of the Persian king Xerxes I, who gave him the cities of Teuthrania and Halisarna around Pergamum, where his descendants Eurysthenes and Procles still ruled at the beginning of the 4th century BC. He accompanied Xerxes I on his invasion of Greece in 480 BC and is alleged to have warned Xerxes not to underestimate the Spartans before the Battle of Thermopylae: Xerxes I also asked Demaratus about his knowledge of the Greeks and if they will put up a fight against the Persian army. In response Demaratus speaks favourably about the Greeks even after being deposed and exiled from Sparta: ;Greek exiles in the Achaemenid Empire Demaratus was one of several Greeks aristocrats who took refuge in the Achaemenid Empire following reversals at home, other famous ones being Themistocles and Gongylos. In general, they were generously rewarded by the Achaemenid kings, and received land grants to support them, and ruled over various cities in Asia Minor.

(A slightly rueful Foreword to Corridors of Power expresses the hope that he is at least entitled to use his own clich√©.) Plot synopsis Corridors of Power is concerned with the attempts of an English MP to influence the country's policy on nuclear weapons in the 1950s. The central character is Roger Quaife, an ambitious politician and Cabinet Minister. He is widely attacked for his stand on Britain's position in the thermonuclear arms race; at the same time his affair with another woman leads to potential blackmail. Lewis attempts to assist him in covering up the affair as he supports Quaife's stand on the nuclear question. Reception In a 1964 book review in Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"a sound reading of the political, moral, ideological temper of the times; a substantial achievement even though one in which intellect has been asserted at the expense of imagination.\\" In a 1964 review in the New York Times, an anonymous reviewer praised Snow's previous work, but called the novel \\"the least successful in the series\\" and summarized; \\"Somehow the vitality, the narrative drive and the intellectual excitement of Sir Charles's other novels are lacking in this one.\\"  Dramatic versions  In the BBC's 1984 television serialisation of Strangers and Brothers, Shaughan Seymour played Lewis Eliot and Anthony Hopkins played Roger Quaife.

The conflict in the Caribbean however which began with the English failed attempt on Hispaniola and the subsequent capture of Jamaica raged on longer.Sankey pp. 663-64 The region thus remained in a state of war, and privateer raids were launched on the Spanish Main led by Buccaneers notably Christopher Myngs and Henry Morgan under the behest of the Jamaican governor Thomas Modyford As far as Modyford was concerned Jamaica would never be secure until Spain acknowledged England's possession of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands and having it named in a treaty.Davenport & Paulin p. 187 In 1667 the Treaty of Madrid was signed between England and Spain although favourable to the former (in terms of trade) there was no mention of the American colonies or the Caribbean as rightful possessions.Fisher/Savelle p.65 (1967) Attacks therefore continued; notably Morgan's brutal attack and sackings of Portobello and Maracaibo over the next two years.Talty pp. 163‚Äì165 In 1669 Mariana, the Queen Regent of Spain in response ordered attacks on English shipping in the Caribbean. Charles II ordered Modyford to issue official letters of marque against the Spanish. Modyford commissioned Morgan once more to raid the Spanish Main. Spain during this time was politically, economically and militarily weak after years of war and political infighting. Charles at the same time saw an opportunity he could not miss and felt the time was right to negotiate a treaty with Spain, as England held a great advantage. The only way Spain could be at an advantage was to recapture Jamaica or if France and Holland were to join in a potential war which Charles was seeking to avoid. Treaty and Terms Negotiations began in the autumn of 1669 between the Spanish representative Gaspar de Bracamonte, count of Pe√±aranda with William Godolphin, Envoy Extraordinary from England. The original language of the treaty was in Latin and the complete English title is: \\"A treaty for the composing of differences, restraining of depredations, and establishing of peace in America, between the crowns of Great Britain and Spain, concluded at Madrid the 8/18 day of July, in the year of our Lord 1670.\\" Spain also confirmed England was to hold all territories in the Western Hemisphere that it had already settled; however the treaty did not define what areas were settled. England took formal control of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands after the treaty was signed: Under the terms of the treaty, all letters of reprisal were revoked by Spain and reciprocal aid to ships in distress along with permission to repair in each others ports were required. England agreed to suppress piracy in the Caribbean and in return Spain agreed to permit English ships freedom of movement. Both agreed to refrain from trading in the other's Caribbean territory, and to limit trading to their own possessions. The treaty was then ratified on 28 September. Consequences In Spain and her colonies the treaty was hated, and was viewed by many as a humiliating surrender. Spain's military, economic and political weakness at the time meant that they were unable to pose any will, which England had taken easy advantage of.Ehrengardt p. 61 Spanish merchants in particular were unwilling to accept the treaty and the Spanish crown had to give special tax C√©dulas as compensation.Stein pp. 63-64 The treaty was highly favourable to England on the other hand, and the fact that Spain recognized England's colonies in the Caribbean as well as the Americas was a major concession.Davenport & Paulin pp. 99 & 188-89 In previous treaties Spain had always insisted that the New World belonged to it.Mirza p. 99Grady p. 66 England effectively challenged Spain in the western Caribbean, and subsequently used Jamaica as a base to support settlements all along the Central American Caribbean coast from the Yucat√°n to (present day) Nicaragua. The new logwood stations there were accepted by Spain but were not recognised and this increased as many ex privateers turned to logwooding.McAlister p. 308 As such the treaty did not establish any boundaries: Spain and England only adopted, in article 7, the principle of actual possession; in Northern America \\"this compact legalized England's ownership as far south as Charleston, and Spain's as far north as Santa Elena Sound, in 32¬∞, 30' north latitude.\\" As a result it was met with consternation by the Spanish in Florida who despite protests had to accept the newly encroached English colony of Charleston. Although piracy was suppressed, English ships were now able to roam the Caribbean sea without hindrance.Sankey pp. 663-64 England had sought this in negotiations with Spain but they had refused in 1655 which was the original reason for the outbreak of war. Spain's acquiescence reversed their previous position that defined any English person in the West Indies as an intruder or a pirate.Pestana p. 2 News of the treaty however did not reach the Caribbean in time for Henry Morgan who on 28 January 1671 had launched a devastating raid on Panama city. The Spanish were furious, and the English saw that Morgan and Modyford had gone too far and had effectively broken the Madrid treaty. In order to restore relations both Modyford and Morgan were recalled and arrested. They went unpunished however, were never convicted and thus released.Walton p. 131 Morgan was even knighted by Charles and made Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica. Spain and England were at peace until 1702 with the War of the Spanish Succession.

The character appeared in the live-action series Smallville, played by Jill Teed, and in the second and third seasons of Supergirl, played by Floriana Lima.  Publication history  Maggie Sawyer first appeared in Superman Vol. 2 #4 and was created by John Byrne.  Fictional character biography  Superman (April 1987) #4. Art by John Byrne. Maggie was introduced in Superman (2nd series) in April 1987, as Captain Sawyer of the Metropolis Special Crimes Unit, a special branch of the Metropolis police force that handles superpowered menaces when Superman is unavailable. Maggie mostly replaced Inspector Henderson from the previous comics as Superman's main police contact. She was added to the Superman canon following the 12-issue maxi-series Crisis on Infinite Earths and the 6-issue miniseries that rebooted the comics, The Man of Steel. She tries to prove the police force is more efficient than a vigilante in fighting crime, and so becomes a constant thorn in Superman's side during the early days of his career, even trying to apprehend him occasionally. Eventually, after being injured and saved by Superman during a terrorist plot, her attitude towards him warms up. Later stories revealed that she originally came from Star City. She married fellow police officer James Sawyer, although she was uncertain about her own sexual identity, and they had a daughter named Jamie. Maggie later came out as a lesbian. James divorced her and won sole custody of Jamie and he refused to let Maggie have any contact with their daughter. Maggie ultimately moved to Metropolis when the SCU position became available and she resumed relations with her family in later stories. Maggie has been in a long- term relationship with Toby Raynes, a reporter for the Metropolis Star. In Action Comics vol. 1 #600, Lex Luthor, then a corporate executive, met with Maggie to get her to stop investigating his activities. He tries to blackmail her with documentation regarding her sexuality. At that time, Maggie was not publicly known to be a lesbian; although some of her colleagues knew, any public disclosure could possibly have discredited her and tainted her career. When Luthor injures himself and flees the room (due to kryptonite poisoning from his ring), Maggie is tempted with taking the damaging evidence left behind on his desk. She opts to leave the file in Luthor's hands, explaining to Inspector Dan Turpin that she is no longer ashamed of who she is and will not allow anyone to use it against her. Maggie has a close working relationship with Inspector Turpin, her second-in-command at the SCU. However, she originally had a strained professional relationship with Inspector Henderson. It was later revealed that Henderson simply disapproved that higher-ranking officers, such as Turpin, reported to her, a Captain. He resolves the situation by promoting her to Inspector when he becomes Commissioner during the Death of Superman storyline. In the aftermath, Sawyer becomes involved in a covert 'war' between Superman's allies and Project Cadmus, led by Paul Westfield, which had stolen Superman's body for their own ends.\\"Superman The Man Of Steel\\" (March 1993) Sawyer's close friendship with injured ex-police officer Eddie Walker is examined in flashback as Walker becomes the hero Loose Cannon.Superman In Action Comics #5 (1993) = Metropolis S.C.U. = Inspector Sawyer is the main character in the four-issue limited series comic title Metropolis SCU written by Cindy Goff, penciled by Peter Krause and inked by Jose Marzan Jr., which was published from November 1994 to February 1995.

He was a grandee and one of the wealthiest peers of the court of Elizabeth I. Under James I, Northumberland was a long-term prisoner in the Tower of London, due to the suspicion that he was complicit in the Gunpowder Plot. He is known for the circles he moved in as well as for his own achievements. He acquired the sobriquet The Wizard Earl (also given to Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare), from his scientific and alchemical experiments, his passion for cartography, and his large library. His mild deafness and slight speech impediment did not prevent him from becoming an important intellectual and cultural figure of his generation. Early life He was born at Tynemouth Castle in Northumberland, England, the son of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland, whom he succeeded in 1585. His father died, an apparent suicide, in the Tower of London, where he was being questioned about his allegedly treasonable dealings with Mary Queen of Scots. His mother was Katherine Neville, daughter and co-heiress of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer and Lucy Somerset. She remarried Francis Fitton of Binfield. He was brought up a Protestant, as his father had been, taking instruction from the vicar of Egremont. This did not prevent suspicions in later life, particularly when he associated with Charles Paget, that he was a crypto-Catholic. Around 1586, he first employed the artist Nicolas Hilliard paying 60 shillings for his portrait. In 1598 he bought a jewel called the \\"Rainbow\\" for ¬£21 from John Spilman.HMC 6th Report (Northumberland) (London, 1877), p. 227. The earl had an African servant who was called the \\"Blackamore\\" in his accounts. The African servant was brought to the earl in 1586 by Mr Crosse's servant, who was rewarded with 20 shillings, and the earl bought new clothes for the African servant costing ¬£6-12s-6d. New shoes in 1588 cost 18 pence.Miranda Kaufmann, Black Tudors (London, 2017), p. 100. Although his earldom was in the north of England, Northumberland also had estates in the south at Petworth House in Sussex and also at Syon House in Middlesex, acquired by his marriage to Lady Dorothy Devereux (sister of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex) in 1594. They had four children: *Lady Dorothy Percy (c.1598 ‚Äì 20 August 1659); married Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, by whom she had six children. *Lady Lucy Percy (1599/1600 ‚Äì 5 November 1660); married as his second wife James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle. *Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland (29 September 1602 ‚Äì 13 October 1668); married firstly, Anne Cecil, by whom he had five daughters, including Elizabeth Percy, Countess of Essex; he married secondly, Lady Elizabeth Howard, by whom he had his heir, Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland. *Henry Percy, Baron Percy of Alnwick (1604 ‚Äì April 1659); died unmarried. Though it did produce a male heir, Algernon, the marriage was not successful, and the couple separated after a time, despite efforts by the Queen, who was fond of Dorothy, to reconcile them. Catholic sympathiser The Percy family was still largely Catholic, while Northumberland was at least nominally Protestant. When it became clear that the Protestant James VI of Scotland was likely to succeed Elizabeth, Northumberland sent his cousin Thomas Percy, a recent Catholic convert, on a secret mission to James's court three times in 1602. He said that English Catholics would accept James as king if he reduced the persecution of Catholics. Northumberland employed Thomas Percy as a rent-collector at Syon House. Thomas was the great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland, but was unscrupulous, with 34 charges of dishonesty brought against him. Henry wrote to James \\"It were a pity to lose a good Kingdom for not tolerating a mass in a corner\\". Through Thomas Percy, Henry received loosely worded assurances of religious tolerance from James. Large portrait miniature by Nicholas Hilliard, 1590‚Äì95. Shortly before James's accession to the English throne in 1603, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury through Lord Henry Howard particularly warned the king against Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Northumberland. This theory of the \\"diabolical triplicity\\" rested on innuendo, about the occult interests supposedly cultivated by the intellectual circles led by Percy and Raleigh, and possibly on the traitorous intent suggested only by rumours from the 1580s that Percy would marry Arbella Stuart, the next heir to the throne after the King and his offspring. Brooke led the Main Plot against James, and Raleigh soon lost his freedom. Northumberland, on the other hand, was appointed to the Privy Council. Thomas Percy went on to become one of the five conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The goal of this plot was to overthrow the Parliament under King James I. When the plot was discovered, Percy fled and was besieged at Holbeche House in Warwickshire. On 8 November 1605, a marksman shot dead both Robert Catesby and Thomas Percy with a single bullet. The Earl of Northumberland was suspected of misprision (having knowledge of the plot but not notifying the authorities). However, the Star Chamber did not have sufficient evidence to convict him of misprision and was unable to disprove his claim that he planned to be present at the fatal meeting of Parliament. They had to resort to more minor charges including his appointment of Thomas Percy to the Gentlemen Pensioners, of which Northumberland was captain, without the king's permission and without Percy taking the Oath of Supremacy. Northumberland was sent to the Tower of London at the king's pleasure and remained there for almost 16 years. He was also fined ¬£30,000, , but in 1613, the king accepted ¬£11,000 in final payment. In the Tower Still a rich man, Northumberland made himself comfortable in the Tower of London. He had spacious apartments in the Martin Tower, which he redecorated and refurbished. He was attended by 20 servants, some of whom he lodged on Tower Hill. He spent ¬£50 per year on books and grew a considerable library. He had his own covered bowling alley and access to facilities for tennis and fencing. He regularly met scholars whom he patronised, including Thomas Harriot, Walter Warner and Robert Hues, who were known as the \\"Earl of Northumberland's Magi.\\" Together with Sir Walter Raleigh, who had preceded Northumberland to the Tower with a death sentence hanging over him, they discussed advanced scientific ideas and smoked tobacco. From 1616, Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset and Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset were inmates of the Tower and on social terms with Northumberland. Frances promoted the marriage of his second daughter Lucy Percy to James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle. He disapproved of the proposed marriage saying that he would not see his daughter, \\"dance to a Scotch jig.\\" For a period, he forced Lucy to reside with him in the Tower but Frances outwitted him. Despite Northumberland's extreme disapproval of the marriage, Hay was determined to win his father-in-law's respect and fought for Northumbernland's release from the Tower, which was achieved in July 1621. After his release, suffering from deafness and poor eyesight, he went to the Bath Inn, later referred to as the Arundel House, to regain his health. Once recovered Northumberland retired to Petworth House where he remained until his death on 5 November 1632. His wife died in 1619. Intellectual interests and associates Peele wrote a poem The Honour of the Garter, dedicated to Northumberland and for the occasion of his admission to the Order of the Garter, on 26 June 1593. Because of his interest in scientific experiments and his library, Northumberland acquired the nickname \\"The Wizard Earl\\". The library was one of the largest in England at the time. He was a patron to Thomas Harriot, Nicholas Hill, Robert Hues, Nathaniel Torporley and Walter Warner The astrologer John Dee, nearby Syon House at Mortlake, was also a friend of Henry, and their circles overlapped. Harriot had been a navigational tutor to Ralegh and his captains. From 1598 (or possibly from 1607) Harriot lived at Syon House. There he used a telescope to make a map of the moon several months before Galileo did the same. He may have been the first person to observe sunspots. Northumberland had also connections to the literati. George Peele wrote a poem, The Honour of the Garter, dedicated to Percy and for the occasion of his admission to the Order of the Garter, on 26 June 1593. For his efforts Peele was paid ¬£3. Christopher Marlowe claimed his acquaintance and certainly moved in the same group. Percy was a friend to John Donne. After Donne's elopement and clandestine marriage in 1601, he had the task of taking a letter for him to the new father-in-law, Sir George More. In William Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost (1594), there is a mention of the \\"School of Night\\". It has been argued that this refers of a circle of scientific investigators which met at Syon House, though other commentators think the word \\"school\\" is a misprint for something like \\"shawl.\\" Since Percy was often considered to be an atheist, the \\"school\\" was sometimes referred to as the \\"School of Atheism.\\" Raleigh was the supposed leader and Thomas Harriot and Marlowe were supposedly members. Frances Yates comments on this hypothetical group, supposedly including also George Chapman as the author of Shadow of Night, as arguably part of Ralegh's circle, to the effect that they would be \\"Saturnians\\" in the sense of her study.

The M1 helmet has become an icon of the US military, with its design inspiring other militaries around the world. History =Development= The Helmet Model Number 5, intended to replace the M1917 but not adopted. At the entry of the United States into World War I, the US military was without a combat helmet; initially US troops arriving in Europe were issued with British Mk I Brodie helmets (those integrated with French units were given French M15 Adrian helmets). The United States quickly commenced manufacture of a version of the Mk I, designated the M1917, producing some 2,700,000 by the end of hostilities.Brayley 2008, p. 112 At that point, the shortcomings of the M1917, which lacked balance and protection of the head from lateral fire, resulted in a project to produce a better helmet which would also have a distinctively American appearance. Between 1919 and 1920, a number of new designs of helmets were tested by the Infantry Board in comparative trials with the M1917 and helmets of other armies. One of those designs, the Helmet Number 5A, was selected for further study.Studler 1941, p. 931 This was an improved version of the Helmet Number 5, developed in 1917 and 1918 by Bashford Dean, the curator of arms and armor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had been rejected during the war because of its supposed resemblance to the German stahlhelm.Dean 1920, p. 216 Eventually, tests held at Fort Benning between 1924 and 1926 showed that although the 5A offered better side protection than the M1917, it was more easily penetrated from above and in some circumstances, could interfere with firing a rifle. Further ballistic tests at the Aberdeen Proving Ground resulted in the decision to retain the M1917 in 1934, which was given a redesigned leather cradle and designated M1917A1Brayley 2008, p. 114 or \\"Kelly\\" helmet. In 1940, with World War II raging on in Europe and Asia, it seemed likely that the United States might soon be at war again and the Infantry Board resurrected the quest to find a better type of helmet, since the ongoing conflict had shown that the M1917, designed to protect men standing in trenches from falling shell splinters and shrapnel, would be inadequate on the modern battlefield. The board reported: An M1 Helmet with camouflage cover, worn by a corporal of the Netherlands Marine Corps in 1945. Accordingly, the board, under the direction Brigadier General Courtney Hodges,Cleland 1954, p. 25 took the M1917 shell as the basis of the new prototype, trimmed off the brim and added a visor and skirt-like extensions to protect the back and sides of the wearer's head.Studler 1941, pp. 933-934 Rejecting the conventional systems of cradles, the new helmet was given a Riddell type liner and suspension system, based on the contemporary style of football helmet, with an adjustable strap for the nape of the neck to prevent the helmet from rocking.Brayley 2008, pp. 117-118 The resulting prototype was designated TS-3 and the McCord Radiator Company manufactured the first examples from Hadfield steel. In tests, they were found to be able to resist a .45 ACP pistol bullet at point-blank range, exceeding the initial specification. The TS-3 was given official approval on June 6, 1941 and was designated \\"Helmet, Steel, M1\\". Full scale production commenced almost immediately.Studler 1941, p. 934 =Service= Over 22 million U.S. M1 steel helmets were manufactured through September 1945.Stanton, Shelby L., U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II, Stackpole Books, 1995, , url:, pp. 57‚Äì58 Production was done by McCord Radiator and Manufacturing Company and Schlueter Manufacturing Company; the former developed a method to create an almost eighteen-centimeter deep bowl in a single pressing, which was an engineering milestone at the time.Tenner, Edward (2003), Our own devices: The past and future of body technology. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. p.252. In 1944, the stainless steel helmet rim with a seam at the front was replaced by a manganese steel rim with a rear seam. Further M1 helmets were manufactured for the Korean War.Brayley 2008, p. 123 Production continued during the Cold War era with periodic improvements; in 1955 a grommet in the front of the liner was deleted, in 1964 the liner construction was changed to laminated nylon and a new chinstrap design was introduced in 1975. The final contract for US M1 helmets was placed in 1976. The M1 was phased out of US service during the 1980s in favor of the PASGT helmet,Hartzog, William W.

Following World War II, the M1 helmet was widely adopted or copied by numerous other countries and its distinctive shape was adopted as the NATO standard. Postwar analysis of wartime casualty figures by the US Army Operations Research Office found that 54 percent of hits to the M1 helmet failed to penetrate, and estimated that 70,000 men had been saved from death or injury by wearing it.Brayley 2008, p. 11 Design camouflage cover and additional natural camouflage added on the slots in the helmet's cover. US soldiers in 1972 wearing M1 helmets The M1 is a combination of two \\"one-size- fits-all\\" helmets‚Äîan outer metal shell, sometimes called the \\"steel pot\\", and a hard hat‚Äìtype liner nestled inside it featuring an adjustable suspension system. Helmet covers and netting would be applied by covering the steel shell with the extra material tucked inside the shell and secured by inserting the liner. The outer shell should not be worn by itself. The liner can be worn by itself, providing protection similar to a hard hat, and was often worn in such fashion by military policemen, Assistant Drill Instructors (known as AIs), and rifle/machine gun/pistol range staff, although they were supposed to wear steel at the range. The liner is sometimes worn in U.S. military ceremonies and parades, painted white or chromed.

After being poured into fifteen-ton ingots (also called \\"heats\\"), the steel was divided into 216-inch by 36-inch by 4-inch blocks, known as \\"lifts,\\" which were then cut into three equal 72-inch pieces to make them easier to handle. The cut lifts were sent to the Gary Works in Gary, Indiana for further processing, after which they were each reduced into 250 68-inch by 36-inch by 0.044-inch sheets, which were cut into 16.5-inch circles. The helmet discs were oiled and banded into lots of 400 for delivery by rail to McCord or Schlueter for pressing and final assembly. Each \\"heat\\" of steel was assigned a unique number by the smelter, as was each of its \\"lifts.\\" When each new heat was unloaded at McCord or Schlueter, it was assigned a sequential number, and each lift within the heat was assigned a letter of the alphabet (for example, the third lift unloaded of the forty-ninth heat received by McCord would be 49C). This unique \\"lot and lift\\" number was stamped onto each helmet produced from the discs of a particular lift, and allowed for traceability in case the helmets exhibited defects. The \\"lot and lift\\" number is in reference to the time when the fabricator received the helmet discs, not when they were made into finished helmets. Lifts of heats were not loaded onto or unloaded from railcars in any particular order, and were often warehoused (also in no particular order) before being finished. The helmet discs were drawn to a depth of seven inches to create the rough helmet shape, or \\"shell,\\" and the edges were trimmed. The edge of the shell has a crimped metal rim running around it, which provides a smooth edge. This is usually known as the \\"rim\\". The rim has a seam where the ends of the strip meet. On the earliest shells the seam met at the front. This was moved to the back of the rim in November 1944 At this time, the rim also went from being made of stainless steel to manganese steel. On each side of the shell, there are stainless steel loops for the chinstrap. Early World War II production shells had fixed, rectangular loops, and mid-war to 1960s helmets feature movable rectangular loops. This feature was adopted in 1943 to address the problem that when earlier helmets were dropped, the fixed loops were more susceptible to breaking off. Early shells for paratrooper helmets feature fixed, D-shaped loops. The shells were then painted with flat olive drab paint, with the paint on the outside of the shell sprinkled with either finely ground cork (World War II era) or silica sand (postwar). World War II- production helmets feature sewn-on cotton web olive drab shade 3 chinstraps, replaced gradually throughout 1943 and 1944 with olive drab shade 7 chinstraps. 1950s and later production chinstraps are made of olive drab webbing attached to the loops with removable metal clips. Nylon chinstraps were introduced in the U.S. military in 1975. These straps featured a two- piece web chin cup and were fastened by a metal snap rather than buckle. Uses Many soldiers wore the webbing chinstraps unfastened or looped around the back of the helmet and clipped together. This practice arose for two reasons: First, because hand-to-hand combat was anticipated, and an enemy could be expected to attack from behind, reach over the helmet, grab its visor, and pull. If the chinstrap were worn, the head would be snapped back, causing the victim to lose balance, and leave the throat and stomach exposed to a knife thrust. Secondly, many men incorrectly believed that a nearby exploding bomb or artillery shell could cause the chinstrap to break their neck when the helmet was caught in its concussive force, although a replacement buckle, the T1 pressure-release buckle, was manufactured that allowed the chinstrap to release automatically should this occur. In place of the chinstrap, the nape strap inside the liner was counted on to provide sufficient contact to keep the helmet from easily falling off the wearer's head. The design of the bowl-like shell led to some novel uses: When separated from the liner, the shell could be used as an entrenching tool, a hammer, washbasin, bucket, bowl,and as a seat. The shell was also used as a cooking pot, but the practice was discouraged as it would make the metal alloy brittle. = Liner = The interior of a M1 Helmet Liner. Construction The liner is a hard hat-like support for the suspension, and is designed to fit snugly inside the steel shell. The first liners were produced in June 1941 and designed by Hawley Products Company. The suspension was initially made from strips of silver rayon webbing stretched around and across the inside of the liner. A sweatband is clipped onto these, and is adjusted to fit around the head of the wearer. Three triangular bands of rayon meet at the top of the helmet, where they were adjusted by a shoestring to fit the height and shape of the wearer's head. A snap-on nape strap cushioned the liner against the back of the wearer's neck and stops it from falling off. As the rayon had a tendency to stretch and not recover its shape, the suspension material was later changed to olive drab number 3, and then olive drab number 7, herringbone twill cotton webbing. World War II and Korean War-era liners have their own chinstrap made from brown leather. The liner chinstrap does not have loops like the shell; it was either riveted directly to the inside of the liner (early examples) or snapped onto studs. It can still swivel inside the liner. The chinstrap is usually seen looped over the brim of the shell, and helps to keep it in place when its own chinstraps are not in use. Early liners were made from a mix of compressed paper fibers impregnated with phenolic resin, with olive drab cotton twill fabric stretched over the outside. They were discontinued in November 1942 because they degraded quickly in high heat and high humidity environments. They were replaced by evolving plastic liners, using a process developed by the Inland Division of General Motors. These liners were made of strips of cotton cloth bathed in phenolic resin and draped in a star shape over a liner-shaped mold, where they were subjected to pressure to form a liner. The initial \\"low pressure\\" process was deemed unacceptable by the Army, but accepted out of need. These liners were made by St. Clair Manufacturing and Hood Rubber Company. Hawley, Hood, and St. Clair's contracts were cancelled by early 1944, when a \\"high pressure\\" process which produced better-quality liners became commercially viable. Companies which produced \\"high pressure\\" liners during World War II included Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, CAPAC Manufacturing, Inland (whose molds were acquired by Firestone after their contract was cancelled), Mine Safety Appliances Company, Seaman Paper Company, and International Molded Plastics, Inc. Liners essentially identical in construction to \\"high pressure\\" World War II examples were produced between 1951 and 1954 during the Korean War by the Micarta Division of Westinghouse and CAPAC Manufacturing. In the 1960s, the M1 helmet liner was redesigned, eliminating the leather chinstrap, nape strap, and changing the suspension webbing to a pattern resembling an asterisk in a coarse cotton web material in lieu of the earlier cotton herringbone twill. In the early 1970s, suspension materials changed to a thicker, more flexible nylon with a rougher unbeveled rim. Later changes included a move to a yellow and green material for liner construction. Paratrooper liners M1 helmet liners intended for use by paratroopers had a different construction. The short piece of webbing which held the nape strap at the back of the wearer's neck was extended around the sides of the liner, and terminated on each side in \\"A\\" shaped yokes which hung down below the rim of the liner and had buckles for an adjustable chin cup made of molded leather. Two female snaps on the inside of the liner above the \\"A\\" yokes accepted male snaps on each of the steel shell's chinstraps, and helped to keep the liner inside the steel shell during abrupt or violent movements. Accessories = Cover = Camouflage-patterned helmet covers of USMC during the Battle of Incheon during the Korean War in 1950. In late 1942, the United States Marine Corps used a cloth helmet cover with a camouflage pattern for its helmets. The cover was made from cotton herringbone twill fabric. It had a \\"forest green\\" pattern on one side and a \\"brown coral island\\" pattern on the other. The United States Army often utilized nets to reduce the helmets' shine when wet and to allow burlap scrim or vegetation to be added for camouflage purposes. Most nets were acquired from British or Canadian Army stocks or cut from larger camouflage nets. The Army did not adopt an official issue net until the \\"Net, Helmet, with Band\\" that included an elastic neoprene band to keep it in place. After World War II, no new covers were issued and at the start of the Korean War, many soldiers had to improvise covers from burlap sandbags or parachute fabric. a consignment of 100,000 olive drab covers was dispatched to the theater, but the ship carrying them, , sank in a collision en route and they were all lost. In the 1963, the Army and Marine Corps adopted a reversible fabric cover called the Mitchel Pattern, with a leafy green pattern on one side and orange and brown cloud pattern on the other.Brayley 2008, p. 124 This type was nearly omnipresent in Vietnam, and where, for the first time, the Army wore the cloth camouflage as general issue. In Vietnam, the green portion of the reversible fabric camouflage was normally worn outermost. Helmet covers in the (European) woodland camouflage, were designed for fighting in the European Theater of Operations (NATO), and became the post-Vietnam (jungle pattern) camouflage cover used by the US military from the late 1970s onward. The (European) Woodland pattern was not reversible; they were only printed on one side, though some rare desert camouflage examples do exist. These covers were all constructed from two semi- circular pieces of cloth stitched together to form a dome-like shape conforming to the helmet's shape. They were secured to the helmet by folding their open ends into the steel pot, and then placing the liner inside, trapping the cloth between the pot and the liner. An olive green elastic band, intended to hold additional camouflage materials, was often worn around the helmet to further hold the cover in place. Other armies used these or similar covers printed with different camouflage patterns, or employed entirely different methods. In the Dutch Army, for example, it was common practice to use a square piece of burlap as a helmet cover on M1 helmets, usually secured by a net (see above) and a wide rubber band. During the Battle of the Bulge and Korean War, soldiers made white helmet covers as camouflage in snowy areas. They were not issued to soldiers, so many soldiers simply made them from a white cloth from a shirt or tablecloth.

The West German M-56 Stahlhelm was a direct copy of the U.S. M1 helmet. It was properly called \\"zweiteiliger Stahlhelm\\" (two-piece steel helmet). In 1958 the helmet was made as a one- piece helmet and renamed Stahlhelm M1A1. The M1A1 came in three sizes: 66, 68, and 71. This helmet was used until 1981 when a modified version was released and renamed the Helm1A1. Modifications included a 3-point chin strap with the third point connecting at the nape, extra large sizes, and a further adjustable liner. The M1A1 Stahlhelm remained in service until 1992 when the Bundeswehr replaced it with a PASGT-derived kevlar helmet called the Gefechtshelm (\\"Combat helmet\\").

The ship was completed at the end of 1944 and was assigned to the 7th Escort Group at the beginning of 1945. While escorting her first and only Arctic convoy to Russia, she claimed to have shot down a German torpedo bomber. Denbigh Castle was torpedoed in early 1945 by the , with the loss of 11 men, near the Soviet coast. The ship was beached in an effort to save her, but she was pulled off by the ebbing tide and capsized. Her wreck was declared a total loss. Design and description The Castle- class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The Castles carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships' complement was 99 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 297 The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns.Chesneau, p. 63; Lenton, p. 297 Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles' sensor suite.Goodwin, p. 3 Construction and career Denbigh Castle, the only ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy,Colledge, p. 94 was ordered on 19 December 1942 and laid down by John Lewis & Sons at their shipyard in Aberdeen, Scotland, on 30 September 1943. The ship was launched on 5 August 1944 and completed on 30 December 1944. She arrived at Tobermory, Mull, Scotland, on 12 January 1945 to begin training at the Royal Navy's Anti-Submarine Training School, HMS Western Isles. Having completed training, Denbigh Castle arrived at Scapa Flow on 29 January to join the 7th Escort Group.Goodwin, p. 139 Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Graham Butcher, the ship escorted Convoy JW 64 to Murmansk at the beginning of February. On the 7th, Denbigh Castle claimed to have shot down a German torpedo bomber.Goodwin, p. 140 Almost a week later, the ship was torpedoed by U-992 as the convoy entered the Kola InletRohwer, p. 392 at 00:13 on 13 February; the corvette's radar had picked up the submarine at a range of , but had not identified her due to the confused radar returns and darkness. The torpedo struck the bow and the crew thought that the ship had struck a mine. The explosion killed eleven ratings and threw the four-inch gun onto the Squid platform behind it. The remaining bow structure sagged downwards, although Denbigh Castle was in no danger of sinking. The destroyer transferred her medical officer over and the corvette Bluebell came alongside around 00:45 to receive casualties, and Butcher ordered as many ratings aboard her as he thought he could spare.

At 05:01, Butcher ordered all remaining hands aboard the Soviet ship because Denbigh Castle was slowly sinking by the bow, only the officers remaining aboard. Buresvestniks captain, not wanting the corvette to founder in the channel, took over the tow at 06:15, by which time her stern was nearly out of the water. Denbigh Castle was beached at 07:30 at Bolshaya Volokovaya Bay near Vaenga; Buresvestnik then pushed her stern around. The ship began to slowly list with the ebbing tide and the officers abandoned her at 09:05; five minutes later she capsized and slid into deeper water. The intense cold made later efforts to retrieve or destroy secret documents and equipment still aboard extremely difficult, but the diving team from the light cruiser did manage to demolish the radar office.

Krusty is elected to Congress and eventually has a bill passed to change the flight path. Plot There is a tremendous rumble and the Simpsons' house shakes. There is a new flight path to Springfield International Airport overhead. A complaint to an airport official has no effect, and the house is now unsellable. Homer and Marge then go to their congressman, who has been Springfield's representative since 1933. He is so upset by their misfortune that he drops dead. Bart asks Krusty the Clown to run for Congress and he agrees, thinking he can also eliminate everything with which the Government is harassing him. He is adopted as the Republican candidate. His campaign starts badly because he has offended so many minorities with his politically incorrect jokes, but Lisa helps him turn his campaign around by having him connect with regular families and citizens. With this advice and a very helpful Fox News programme, he is elected. To Krusty's chagrin, no-one pays attention to a freshman Congressman, and he is set to work cleaning the graffiti off the walls. He, and the Simpsons, are about to give up, but a janitor, who resembles Walter Mondale, explains to them how a bill really becomes a law.

Finally, during a session in Congress, the janitor and Lisa, with Homer's drunken diversion, fix the Air Traffic Bill with a paperclip to another bill giving orphans American flags. When the bill comes up for a vote, both the blackmailed congressman and the drunk one consent, and it is passed. Krusty praises the processes of democracy. At home, the Simpsons are happy to get the peace and quiet that they heroically fought for. Homer says that the planes are now flying where they belong ‚Äî over the homes of poor people. Controversy At one point during the episode, the family is watching Krusty and his opponent debate on the Fox News Channel, which showed several headlines in its news ticker that parodied the right-leaning network's political views. Among the headlines in the news ticker were \\"Pointless news crawls up 37 percent,\\" \\"Do Democrats cause cancer? Find out at foxnews.com,\\" \\"Rupert Murdoch: Terrific dancer,\\" \\"Dow down 5,000 points,\\" \\"Study: 92 percent of Democrats are gay,\\" \\"JFK posthumously joins Republican Party,\\" and \\"Oil slicks found to keep seals young, supple.\\" Several months after the episode originally aired, Matt Groening claimed that Fox News, the corporate sister to the Fox Broadcasting Company that airs the show, threatened to sue Groening, but opted against \\"suing itself.\\" Groening mentioned that while they got away with the joke, they were no longer allowed to parody news tickers on the show. Despite that, the show would still parody Fox News on several occasions afterward. The Dow Jones & Company, which owned the Dow Jones Industrial Average that was parodied in the news ticker, would be purchased by News Corporation in 2007 and would be a corporate sister to Fox until the 2013 split between the new News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, which was further split with the acquisition of the film and television assets of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company on March 19, 2019, with Fox News Channel now part of the Fox Corporation.

The area is often called the 798 Art District or Factory 798 although technically, Factory #798 is only one of several structures inside the complex formerly known as 718 Joint Factory. The buildings are within alleys number 2 and 4 on Ji«îxiƒÅnqi√°o L√π (ÈÖí‰ªôÊ°•Ë∑Ø), south of the D√†shƒÅnziqi√°o flyover (Â§ßÂ±±Â≠êÊ°•). The area is anchored by the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, the largest and most visited venue in the area. In recent years, it has been the main venue for the annual Beijing Queer Film Festival and Beijing Design Week. Construction 798 Space gallery, January 2009. Old Maoist slogans are visible on the ceiling arches. The Dashanzi factory complex began as an extension of the \\"Socialist Unification Plan\\" of military- industrial cooperation between the Soviet Union and the newly formed People's Republic of China. By 1951, 156 \\"joint factory\\" projects had been realized under that agreement, part of the Chinese government's first Five-Year Plan. However, the People's Liberation Army still had a dire need of modern electronic components, which were produced in only two of the joint factories. The Russians were unwilling to undertake an additional project at the time and suggested that the Chinese turn to East Germany where much of the Soviet Union's electronics equipment was imported. So at the request of then-Premier Zhou Enlai, scientists and engineers joined the first Chinese trade delegation to East Germany in 1951, visiting a dozen factories. The project was green- lighted in early 1952 and a Chinese preparatory group was sent to East Berlin to prepare design plans. This project, which was to be the largest by East Germany in China, was then informally known as Project #157. The architectural plans were left to the Germans, who chose a functional Bauhaus-influenced design over the more ornamental Soviet style, triggering the first of many disputes between the German and Russian consultants on the project. The plans, where form follows function, called for large indoor spaces designed to let the maximum amount of natural light into the workplace. Arch-supported sections of the ceiling would curve upwards then fall diagonally along the high slanted banks or windows; this pattern would be repeated several times in the larger rooms, giving the roof its characteristic sawtooth-like appearance. Despite Beijing's northern location, the windows were all to face north because the light from that direction would cast fewer shadows. The chosen location was a 640,000 square meter area in Dashanzi, then a low-lying patch of farmland northeast of Beijing. The complex was to occupy 500,000 square meters, 370,000 of which were allocated to living quarters. It was officially named Joint Factory 718, following the Chinese government's method of naming military factories starting with the number 7. Fully funded by the Chinese side, the initial budget was enormous for the times: 9 million rubles or approximately 140 million RMB (US$17 million) at today's rates; actual costs were 147 million RMB. Ground was broken in April 1954. Construction was marked by disagreements between the Chinese, Soviet and German experts, which led at one point to a six-month postponement of the project. The Germans' harshest critic was the Russian technology consultant in charge of Beijing's two Soviet-built electronics factories (714 and 738), who was also head consultant of the Radio Industrial Office of the Second Ministry of Machine Building Industry. The disputes generally revolved around the Germans' high but expensive quality standards for buildings and machines, which were called \\"over-engineering\\" by the Russians. Among such points of contention was the Germans' insistence, historical seismic data in hand, that the buildings be built to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale, whereas the Chinese and Russians wanted to settle for 7. Communications expert Wang Zheng, head of Communications Industry in the Chinese Ministry of National Defense and supporter the East German bid from the start, ruled in favor of the Germans for this particular factory. At the height of the construction effort, more than 100 East German foreign experts worked on the project. The resources of 22 of their factories supplied the construction; at the same time, supply delays were caused by the Soviet Red Army's tremendous drain on East Germany's industrial production. The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian railway, and a 15 km track of railroad between Beijing railway station and Dongjiao Station was built especially to service the factory. Caltech-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (ÁΩóÊ≤õÈúñ), formerly head of the preparatory group in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase. Dr. Luo, now retired in Beijing, is remembered by his former colleagues as a dedicated perfectionist whose commitment to the obstacle-strewn project was a major factor of its eventual success. Operation Joint Factory 718 Joint Factory 718 began production in 1957, amid a grandiose opening ceremony and display of Communist brotherhood between China and East Germany, attended by high officials of both countries. The first director was Li Rui (ÊùéÁëû), who had been involved in the early negotiations in Berlin. The factory quickly established a reputation for itself as one of the best in China. Through its several danwei or \\"work units\\", it offered considerable social benefits to its 10,000-20,000 workers, especially considering the relative poverty of the country during such periods as the Great Leap Forward. The factory boasted, among others: * the best housing available to workers in Beijing, providing fully furnished rooms to whole families for less than 1/30 of the workers' income; * diverse extracurricular activities such as social and sporting events, dancing, swimming, and training classes; * its own athletics, soccer, basketball and volleyball teams for men and women, ranked among the best in inter-factory competitions; * a brigade of German-made motorcycles, performing races and stunt demonstrations; * an orchestra that played not only revolutionary hymns but also German-influenced classical Western music; * literary clubs and publications, and a library furnished with Chinese and foreign (German) books; * Jiuxianqiao hospital, featuring German equipment and offering the most advanced dental facilities in China. The factory even had its own volunteer military reserves or jinweishi (ËøëÂç´Â∏à), which numbered hundreds and were equipped with large-scale weapons and anti-aircraft guns. Workers' skills were honed by frequent personnel exchanges, internships and training in cooperation with East Germany. Different incentives kept motivation high, such as rewards systems and \\"model worker\\" distinctions. At the same time, political activities such as Maoism study workshops kept the workers in line with Communist Party of China doctrine. During the Cultural revolution, propaganda slogans for Mao Zedong Thought were painted on the ceiling arches in bright red characters (where they remain today at the latter tenants' request). Frequent VIP visits contributed to the festive atmosphere. Notable guests included Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, and Kim Il-Sung. The Joint Factory produced a wide variety of military and civilian equipment. Civilian production included acoustic equipment for Beijing's Workers' Stadium and Great Hall of the People, as well as all the loudspeakers on Tiananmen Square and Chang'an Avenue. Military components were also exported to China's Communist allies, and helped establish North Korea's wireless electronics industry. One of the old machine tools in front of some contemporary art in Dec 2005 After 10 years of operation, Joint Factory 718 was split into more manageable components, such as sub-Factories 706, 707, 751, 761, 797 and 798. The first Head of sub-Factory 798 (the largest) was Branch Party Secretary Fu Ke (ÂÇÖÂÖã), who played a major role in recruiting skilled workers from southern China and returned overseas Chinese. However, the factory came under pressure during Deng Xiaoping's reforms of the 1980s. Deprived of governmental support like many state-owned enterprises, it underwent a gradual decline and was eventually rendered obsolete. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most sub- factories had ceased production, 60% of the workers had been laid off, and the remains of the management were reconstituted as part of a real-estate operation called \\"Seven-Star Huadian Science and Technology Group\\", charged with overseeing the industrial park and finding tenants for the abandoned buildings. Artistic rebirth The Dashanzi factory complex was vacated at around the time when most of Beijing's contemporary artist community was looking for a new home. Avant-garde art was frowned upon by the government and the community had traditionally existed on the fringes of the city. From 1984 to 1995, they worked in run-down houses near the Old Summer Palace in northwestern Beijing, until their eviction. Many then moved to the eastern Tong County (now Tongzhou District), more than an hour's drive from the city center. Then in 1995, Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), looking for storage and workshop space, set up in the now defunct Factory 706. The temporary move became permanent and in 2000 Sui Jianguo, Dean of the Department of Sculpture, located his own studio in the area. The cluttered sculpture workshops have always remained open for visitors to peek at the dozens of workers milling about. By 2003, an artistic community of over 30 artists, designers, and publishers had developed. The first creatives to take residence in the district included artist Xu Yong, designer artist Huang Rui, publisher Robert Bernell, painter Li Songsong, and Beijing Tokyo Art Projects' Tabata Yukihito. One of the first exhibition spaces, Beijing Tokyo Art Projects (BTAP, Âåó‰∫¨‰∏ú‰∫¨Ëâ∫ÊúØÂ∑•Á®ã), was opened by Tabata Yukihito of Japan's Tokyo Gallery. Inside a 400-m¬≤ division of Factory 798's main area, this was the first renovated space featuring the high arched ceilings that would become synonymous with the Art District. BTAP's 2002 opening exhibition \\"Beijing Afloat\\" (curator: Feng Boyi), drew a crowd of over 1,000 people and marked the beginning of the popular infatuation with the area. In 2002, Huang Rui (ÈªÑÈîê) and hutong photographer Xu Yong (ÂæêÂãá) set up the 798 Space gallery (Êó∂ÊÄÅÁ©∫Èó¥) next to BTAP. With its cavernous 1200-m¬≤ floor and multiple-arched ceilings at the center of Factory 798, it was and still is the symbolic center of the whole district. (Huang and Xu since designed at least seven spaces in the area and became the prime movers and de facto spokespersons of the District.) A glass- fronted caf√© was set up in the former office section at the back of the 798 space, opening into a back alley now lined with studios and restaurants such as Huang's own At Caf√©, and Cang Xin's #6 Sichuan restaurant, the area's \\"canteen\\". American Robert Bernell was the first foreigner to move in and brought his Timezone 8 Art Books bookshop, gallery and publishing office to a former factory canteen. One of Timezone 8's early employees was fashion designer Xiao Li, who along with her husband, performance artist Cang Xin, and Bernell, helped artists secure and rent spaces in the area. Through word-of- mouth, artists and designers started trickling in, attracted to the vast cathedral-like spaces. Despite the lack of any conscious aesthetic in the Bauhaus-inspired style, which grounded architectural beauty in practical, industrial function, the swooping arcs and soaring chimneys had an uplifting effect on modern eyes, a sort of post-industrial chic. At the artists' requests, workers renovating the spaces preserved the prominent Maoist slogans on the arches, adding a touch of ironic \\"Mao kitsch\\" to the place. In 2003, Lu Jie (Âç¢Êù∞) set up the Long March Foundation, an ongoing project for artistic re- interpretation of the historical Long March, inside the 25,000 Li Cultural Transmission Center (‰∫å‰∏á‰∫îÂçÉÈáåÊñáÂåñ‰º†Êí≠‰∏≠ÂøÉ). Around that time, Singapore-owned China Art Seasons (Âåó‰∫¨Â≠£ËäÇÁîªÂªä) opened for display for pan-Asian art, and was one of several new galleries setting up at that time. The UCCA Center for Contemporary Art was set up shortly thereafter in one of the largest factories in the complex, and after recent renovations, serves as the anchor institution and most prominent, and most visited, art landmarks in the area. Notable exhibitions Several exhibitions of note took place in 2003. In March 2004, \\"Transborder Language\\", part of the First Dashanzhi International Art Festival, (curators: Huang Rui and Thomas J. Berghuis) combined poetry installation and performance art. \\"Blue Sky Exposure\\" was held outdoors in southern Beijing and then relocated to the Art District. On April 13, despite widespread fear of public gatherings during SARS, the exhibitions \\"Reconstruction 798\\" (798 space) and \\"Operation Ink Freedom\\" (25,000 Li Cultural Transmission Center) drew crowds of 5,000 and definitely confirmed the area's widespread appeal. In July, with Beijing in full construction boom, Wang Wei's \\"Temporary Space\\" (curator: Philip Tinari) featured workers completely enclosing an area of the exhibition with a brick wall and then removing the bricks one by one. In September, \\"Left Hand - Right Hand\\" (curator: Feng Boyi) showcased Chinese and German sculptors at 798 Space and Daoyaolu Workshop A. Among the works was Sui Jianguo's enormous concrete sculpture \\"Mao's Right Hand\\", which is just what the name suggests, and an example of modern Chinese art's ironic reflections on history. The first Beijing Biennale was held on September 18, 2003 at the Art District and featured 14 exhibitions. \\"Tui-Transfiguration\\" (curator: Wu Hung; tui here roughly means moult) featured photographs by East Village chronicler Rong Rong (Ëç£Ëç£) and his wife, Japan-born Inri (Êò†Èáå). Their works notably featured their own naked bodies in various strange locales, and were generally well-received despite being criticized by some as typical of the self-centered nature of much art in the area. The first Dashanzi International Art Festival, directed by the ever-present Huang Rui, was held from April 24 to May 23, 2004. This first edition, named Radiance and Resonance/Signals of Time (ÂÖâ‚Ä¢Èü≥ / ÂÖâÈò¥), was beset by logistical problems arising from landowner Seven-Star Group's increasing irritation with the art community. As such, the festival became as much a public protest against the area's upcoming destruction that a showcase of art itself. The environmental performance artist Brother Nut installed his project, ‚ÄúNongfu Spring Market,‚Äù in 798 Art Zone in 2018. A commentary on pollution in China, this project received international attention including an article in The New York Times. One of the most (in)famous displays at the Festival was performance artist He Yunchang having himself cemented shut in a wooden box with only two pipes for ventilation, and staying there for 24 hours before being chiseled out, prompting the proverbial \\"Is it art?\\" questionings. \\"Shock\\" exhibitions have become increasingly common in the Art District. In 2008 there were notable exhibitions of foreign artists from Italy (\\"Rabarama. Italian Shape\\", AnniArt Gallery 798,): Rabarama and Cesare Berlingeri. Gentrification Dior in 798 Art District The district's popularity has exploded since the opening of BTAP and 798 Space in 2002, with scores of galleries, lofts, publishing firms, design companies, high-end tailor shops, and caf√©s and fancy restaurants setting up. In 2003, around 30 artists and organizations had set up studios or offices in the area, with 200 more reportedly on the waiting list to move in. Fashionable clubs also sprang up such as Zhou Ying's \\"Vibes\\", known for its fetish nights. A former factory cafeteria became Yan Club (‰ªÅ‰ø±‰πêÈÉ®), owned by well-known Beijing socialite and writer Li Xuebing or \\"Bing Bing\\" (ÂÜ∞ÂÜ∞), also owner of Sanlitun's Jam House. Notable performers at Yan included Morcheeba in March 2003. In keeping with the area's \\"community spirit\\", most galleries and spaces in Dashanzi do not charge either exhibitors or visitors. Instead, they generally sustain themselves by hosting profitable fashion shows and corporate events; among others, Sony had a product launch gala at 798 space, and watchmaker Omega presented a fashion show at Yan Club. Others include Christian Dior, Royal Dutch Shell and Toyota; supermodel Cindy Crawford also made an appearance. Even Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings held an event in the district, which some found unsettling given the real-estate industry's designs on the land it sits on. As such, Dashanzi is now a center of Beijing's nascent \\"BoBo\\" (bourgeois-bohemian) community. Huang Rui and Xu Yong are good representatives of the type. A local guru of sorts is artist/curator/architect Ai Weiwei (ËâæÊú™Êú™), whose self-designed house in Caochangdi just outside the factory complex was a trend-setter. In the absence of any rent control, tenants' costs have escalated. In 2000‚Äì2001, rents were 0.8 RMB per square metre per day (24 RMB or US$2.90/m¬≤/month, or about US$0.27/sq.foot/month). They increased slightly to 30 RMB/m¬≤/month in 2003, and then doubled to 60 RMB/m¬≤/month (US$0.67/sq.foot/month) in 2004. Total costs can be quite high considering the average 200‚Äì400 m¬≤ area of the spaces, and the overhead of renovating and retrofitting the rooms to use modern appliances. Another sign of creeping gentrification is the increasing number of luxury cars parked near the galleries; local artist Zhao Bandi purchased the first Alfa Romeo convertible in Beijing. Some (but not all) of the resident artists and their patrons are quite rich compared to other occupants of the area, the remaining factory workers. Some of the workshops are still operational on a small scale, mostly doing car repair or industrial laundry. Some local artists such as Zhang Zhaohui, a New York-trained art critic and curator, and architect Zhu Jun, a new Dashanzi resident, have criticized the Art District as being less about art and more about show. Says Zhang: \\"Few of the artists come to seriously practice art. Most of them just come for opportunities to exhibit and sell works or just have parties and gatherings.\\" (China Daily)http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/63022.htm On the other hand, young artists like Zhang Yue find this atmosphere particularly conducive to establishing one's career. In the course of one summer, Dashanzi Art District's Platform China Contemporary Art Institute and Unlimited Art Gallery afforded this rising artist two well-received solo shows. Closure averted In the days of Joint Factory 718, Dashanzi was chosen for its peripheral position well outside the city center. The artists who later moved there were attracted from the fringes of the city as well. However, the area today sits right on the strategic corridor between the Capital Airport and downtown Beijing along the Airport Expressway. In the context of China's current real estate bubble, the district is highly likely to be demolished in the near future. Hints of development are already appearing with the western entrances of the complex flanked by the Jiuxian and Hongyuan luxury apartment towers. There are all the current government projects which call for the expansion of the neighboring industrial park to turn all of Dashanzi into a high-tech development zone similar to Zhongguancun. Landowner Seven-Star Group thus hopes to re-employ some of the 10,000 laid-off workers it is still responsible for. Influential members of the artist community and architects are lobbying various government instances to persuade them to allow the old buildings to remain, to help grow organically a cultural center that Beijing otherwise lacks. In 2003, International Architects Salon roped in architects from various international architectural associations and renowned architects like Bernard Tschumi and Coop Himmelblau's Wolf Prix to help emphasize how important attractive spaces like Factory 798 are to the international design community. They point out that such communities are important if Beijing, and China, is to become a major source of creative design instead of mere low cost low value-added manufacturing. (This issue has far-reaching implications in the domain of intellectual property protection in China - some experts believe that the local IP laws will start to be enforced only when China becomes a source of its own intellectual property.)Patrons stroll through the 798 Art Zone, Beijing, April 2009 A crucial participant in the lobbying effort is resident sculptor Li Xiangqun, professor at the Academy of Arts and Design of Tsinghua University, who was elected deputy of the 12th National People's Congress in 2004. Li presented the municipal government with a formal bill in February, requesting the suspension of the destruction plans and preservation of the buildings as part of an Olympic-caliber cultural center. Professors from architecture schools such as Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Southern California Institute of Architecture have proposed various development plans for the area that involve preserving the buildings, although those do not appear especially profitable financially. Meanwhile, attempts have been made to appeal to the developers' sense of economics by pointing out similarities with New York's Greenwich Village and SoHo, where the high profitability of real estate is due partly to the presence of former post- industrial artists' dwellings. Those arguments have so far been ignored. In 2004, Seven-Star Group froze the rental of new spaces and prohibited all renewals. Tenants resorted to subdividing and subleasing their spaces, to which the Group responded by attempting to forbid subleasing to cultural organizations or to foreigners, hoping to drive out the artists. Tenants, despite some of them having leases still valid for several years, were given the ultimatum of December 31, 2005 to vacate the premises. By 2006, public outcry was relentless, and prominent cultural organizations from around the world spoke up. An unlikely duo including SevenStar, a government-led consortium acting as stewards of a pension fund for former factory workers, and Guy Ullens, a Belgian philanthropist who had amassed the world's largest collection of contemporary Chinese art, commissioned Boston-based design firm Sasaki Associates to produce a vision plan which sought to re-purpose the district into a stable source of revenue while providing a much-needed destination for China's burgeoning arts scene. The plan needed to inspire multiple stakeholders with often divergent interests. First, the city government in Beijing wanted to ensure that the district would a visible and acclaimed destination. Second, the land-holder, SevenStar Group, needed to generate a sustainable revenue stream to endow the pension fund of former factory workers. Third, international and Chinese non-profit cultural institutions investing in 798 such as the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art wanted to focus on culture and protecting the district's distinctive character. Finally, residents of adjacent neighborhoods were vocal about the need for community parks, recreation, and job opportunities. Considering these voices equally, the Sasaki Associates master plan for 798 endeavored to reach consensus with a long-game approach to redevelopment. Leading with clear principles and detailed guidelines, the plan was an opportunity to codify the values of the district. To address the city's concerns, connections from nearby transit stations were strengthened, historic buildings were cataloged, and guidelines for their preservation and adaptive reuse were outlined. Next, a long-term strategy for obtaining revenue from new building leases was realized. A proposed arts school, artist-in-residence program, and requirements that tenants are involved in a creative industry provided cultural institutions with a sense that 798 would attract new talent and ideas. Last, multiple parks and plazas responded to community desire for more public open space. By the end of 2007, it was decided that the area would continue in its current format of a special art zone. In 2009, the area has been refurbished and is thriving. 798's abandoned factory buildings have been transformed into new museums, galleries, and cafes. Fallow fields and once hidden courtyards have reemerged as settings for outdoor sculpture, fashion shows, and other cultural events. The roads have been repaved, new galleries have opened, and a cafe culture is emerging. What began as a small collection of ephemeral studios and other workspaces has become the third most visited destination in Beijing, after the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.

Interneurons are the central nodes of neural circuits, enabling communication between sensory or motor neurons and the central nervous system (CNS). They play vital roles in reflexes, neuronal oscillations, and neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Interneurons can be further broken down into two groups: local interneurons and relay interneurons. Local interneurons have short axons and form circuits with nearby neurons to analyze small pieces of information. Relay interneurons have long axons and connect circuits of neurons in one region of the brain with those in other regions. The interaction between interneurons allow the brain to perform complex functions such as learning, and decision-making. Structure In the neocortex (making up about 80% of the human brain), approximately 20‚Äì30% of neurons are interneurons. Investigations into the molecular diversity of neurons is impeded by the inability to isolate cell populations born at different times for gene expression analysis. An effective means of identifying coetaneous interneurons is neuronal birthdating. This can be achieved using nucleoside analogs such as EdU. In 2008, a nomenclature for the features of GABAergic cortical interneurons was proposed, called Petilla terminology. = Spinal cord = * Ia inhibitory interneuron: Found in lamina VII.

The first generation produced two versions based on the Honda Accord CB series called the Ascot and from 1993 to 1996 a \\"pillared hardtop\\" called the Ascot Innova. The Innova shared much of its mechanicals with the European-market Accord manufactured at the Honda UK facility in Swindon, England, and was essentially the badge engineered Rover 600. The second generation was a platform improvement, shared with the Japan-only sedan called the Honda Rafaga. The \\"Ascot\\" name was chosen with reference to the Ascot Racecourse and Ascot tie, in order to add the model an alleged air of class and elegance. Honda Ascot was also used on a range of one-cylinder motorcycles in the first half of the 1980s. __TOC__  First generation (CB1/2/3/4)  The first Honda Ascot was borne out Honda's strategy to diversify its sales channels in Japan. In 1985, two separate dealer networks were established, under the names of Honda Clio and Honda Primo, in addition to the already existing Honda Verno network. While the Primo stores handled kei cars, as well as the Honda Civic, the Clio stores focused on larger models, including the top-of-the-line Honda Legend. With the arrival of the fourth-generation Honda Accord (CB) its sales were assigned solely to Honda Clio. That meant, however, that the Honda Primo network needed an Accord-based compact sedan for the dealership channel. Honda adopted a rather simple solution of creating a \\"sister car\\" to Accord, the Honda Ascot. Technically, the Ascot was identical to the Accord sedan, and the interior, including the dashboard, was shared with the Accord. The exterior sheetmetal was unique to the Ascot, with cosmetic differences provided for a different look, befitting the Ascot's upmarket role as the top-of-the-line model of Honda Primo, which sold small, entry-level products. The headlight units were borrowed from the Honda Inspire, adding to its luxurious appearance, as well as installing LED high mounted brake light in the trunk rear spoiler. It came in five trim levels; the FB and the FBX came with the 1.8 litre engine, with the 2.0Si, 2.0FBX-i as the mid-level package, with the top level 2.0FBT-i included four- wheel anti-lock disc brakes, traction control, a viscous coupling differential, four-wheel steering, and four-wheel double wishbone suspension, with the 2.0 Liter PGM-FI fuel injection engine. Two different engine displacement choices were given so as to allow the Japanese driver which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The fuel economy for the top level engine was rated at according to figures quoted in sales materials. Here's a Honda promotional video introducing the Ascot FBT-i. The Ascot had a six-light greenhouse compared to the regular Accord's four-light layout, and featured a different front end with a more formal grille, as well as a revised rear end with an Ascot specific rear tail light treatment, installing the rear license plate indented into the rear bumper. The styling approach was also duplicated on the smaller Honda Concerto, a platform shared with the Honda Civic of the same time period. The Ascot was launched on September 13, 1989, and the television commercials initially featured the \\"Take the A-Train\\" jazz standard A-train commercial. Later on, Honda decided to change the marketing image of the car, employing Eric Clapton to do the commercials. In August 1991, a rehashed Ascot was presented, allegedly \\"refined to better suit the Japanese taste\\". In March 1992, Honda presented an all-new Honda Ascot Innova (see below), while the regular Ascot was replaced by an all-new model in 1993. = Ascot Innova (CB3/4) = Launched on March 5, 1992, the () was also based on the CB Accord underpinnings, but was given an all-new, modern-looking and rounded body, with styling similar to the Honda Prelude BB4 series (1992‚Äì1996). It was the result of a joint effort with the Rover Group that provided Rover with the 600 series, and an Accord that was unique to Europe.http://www.honda.co.jp/news/1992/4920303.html Honda Ascot Innova (Japanese) The Innova retained the original Ascot's six-light greenhouse layout and horizontal taillights, as well as long, sleek and low body proportions (as opposed to the second-generation Ascot's upright stance and more Accord CF-like rear end). The Innova was fitted with frameless side glazing to provide for the \\"pillared hardtop\\" look, thus being Honda's answer to cars like the Toyota Carina ED/Toyota Corona EXiV, Nissan Bluebird ARX and Mitsubishi Emeraude. The Ascot Innova was sold in conjunction to the Ascot, and did not replace it. The Ascot Innova was available in three four-cylinder engine choices: the 2.0-litre F20A unit, producing in the less expensive 2.0iC and 2.0i versions with SOHC, in the 2.0Si trim with DOHC, and the H-series 2.3-litre H23A engine fitted in the export versions of the Prelude, producing (the 2.3-litre versions were designated 2.3Si-Z). While the 2.0-litre versions maintained the width which allowed them to remain in the favorable tax class, the 2.3-litre Innovas were wide, as the engine displacement didn't allow them to remain in the lower tax band, and buyers in Japan were also liable for a higher annual road tax bill also. A 4-wheel steering system like the one in the Prelude was made available for the 2.0i, 2.0Si and 2.3Si-Z versions. Apart from the cheapest 2.0iC version, which came with a 5-speed manual transmission, all Ascot Innovas came with a 4-speed automatic. The Ascot Innova range started at ¬•1,558,000 for the 2.0iC in the Tokyo sales area, while the most expensive 2.3Si-Z fetched ¬•2,992,000 in Sapporo area, not including extra charges for options such as 4-wheel steering, moonroof, passenger airbag, cornering lamps or ABS. The television advertising campaign was built around the slogan \\"Hardtop Innovation\\" and featured the American actress Geena Davis. The Ascot Innova itself remained a JDM-only model, and a Honda Primo exclusive, with no JDM sister cars. It was the result of shared efforts with British partner Rover Group, and the car was sold as the European Accord, which was made in Swindon, UK and marketed in Europe as Honda Accord instead of the North American version. The European Accord and the Ascot Innova differ only slightly, with the Euro-Accord being wider and featuring framed windows. Normally, this type of vehicle with a sports car influence would have been sold at Honda Verno, however because of its strong similarity to the Prelude, and Honda Verno already had a luxury sports sedan called the Honda Vigor, the Ascott Innova was assigned to Honda Primo instead, as Honda Clio had the Honda Legend. The European Accord was in turn the base for the Rover 600 saloon, developed under Honda's long-standing relationship with the British Rover Group. The Rover 600 and the Swindon Accord also shared two engine options not available for the Ascot Innova - Honda's F18A 1.8-litre unit and Rover's 2.0-litre L-series turbodiesel. The Ascot Innova remained in production until 1996, while the European Accord saloon continued until 1998, with a facelifted model in 1996. In 1998, it was replaced with an all-new model. =Trim Levels= *2,000cc SOHC F20A engine (135 PS) **2.0iÔΩ•C **2.0i **2.0iÔΩ•4WS *2,000cc DOHC F20A engine (150 PS) **2.0Si **2.0SiÔΩ•4WS *2,300cc DOHC H23A engine (165 PS) **2.3Si-Z **2.3Si-ZÔΩ•4WS **2.3Si-ZÔΩ•TCV **2.3Si-ZÔΩ•TCVÔΩ•4WS  Second generation (CE)  The next-generation (CD) Accord grew in size considerably, mostly to satisfy North American market efforts, and thus became too wide to fit within the favorable Japanese tax class. Therefore, Honda needed a slightly smaller compact sedan to cater to the JDM market, and this duty was assigned to the new Ascot *Japanese TV commercial for the Honda Ascot. Rather than being directly based on the now larger Accord, the new Ascot was given its own platform, with the codenames CE4/5, which was a platform improvement of the previous generation. Like the Inspire, Vigor and the even larger Honda Legend, the CE Ascot had its engines mounted longitudinally, contrary to the Accord and most other FWD cars, employing the transverse setup, thereby placing the weight of the engine aligned and behind the front axle and improving vehicle weight distribution between the front and rear axles. In Japan, the smaller G20A engine used regular grade fuel, while the larger G25A engine used premium grade fuel. The new Ascot had a sloping appearance resembling a coup√©, rendering the vehicle shorter and taller than both the CD Accord, Ascot Innova and the Inspire, thus continuing the first Ascot's role as a premium entry-level formal sedan. It was fitted with the 5-cylinder inline Honda G engine, also employed by the Inspire and Vigor, in two displacement versions - 2.0-litre and 2.5-litre, with the gearbox slotted behind it. The wheelbase of the Ascot was shorter than the slightly longer Inspire and Vigor, which measured at , a difference of , which didn't leave much room for rear seat passengers. Furthermore, due to the lengthwise installation of the five-cylinder engine, and the requirement that the overall length of the car comply with Japanese government regulations concerning cars classified as \\"compact\\", compromises were made with regards to rear passenger accommodations, and sales suffered as a result. The Ascot also spawned a sister car, the Honda Rafaga, which was sold at Honda Verno stores, which differed from the Ascot only by different external trim details. Both models were replaced by the CF series Accord platform twin Honda Torneo in 1997.

It was written by Adrian Conan Doyle, who was the son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the creator of Sherlock Holmes), and by John Dickson Carr, who was the authorised biographer of the elder Conan Doyle. As an early and, due to the authors, rather authoritative example of Sherlockian pastiche, The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes is of much interest among Sherlockians. Each story in this collection is postscripted with a quote from one of the original Sherlock Holmes stories, making reference to an undocumented Holmes case that inspired it. Stories and writing In 1945, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's son, Adrian Conan Doyle, began a collaboration with his father's biographer, John Dickson Carr, to publish twelve new exploits of Sherlock Holmes and Watson (of which one appeared in Life magazine and the other eleven stories were published in Collier's magazine) based on cases that had been referred to in passing in the four canonical novels and 56 original short stories of Sherlock Holmes, but which had never been written up by Watson (see the below mentioned postscripts found at the end of each of the twelve new exploits). The stories contained in the collection are: *\\"The Adventure of the Seven Clocks\\" - post-scripted as \\"The Case of the Trepoff Murder\\" mentioned in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Gold Hunter\\" - post-scripted as \\"The Camberwell Poisoning Case\\" mentioned in \\"The Five Orange Pips\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Wax Gamblers\\" - post-scripted from \\"The Case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal\\" mentioned in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" (however, this exploit is not the one mentioned in the Doyle story, but is instead a second one. It does refer to the previous one, though.) *\\"The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle\\" - post-scripted as \\"The Tale of Mr. James Phillimore\\" mentioned in \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Black Baronet\\" - post-scripted as the affair of \\"The Unfortunate Madame Montpensier\\" mentioned in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Sealed Room\\" - post-scripted as the case of \\"Colonel Warburton's Madness\\" mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb\\" *\\"The Adventure of Foulkes Rath\\" - post-scripted as the account of \\"The Addleton Tragedy\\" mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Abbas Ruby\\" - post-scripted as the affair of \\"The Famous Card Scandal of the Nonpareil Club\\" mentioned in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Dark Angels\\" - post-scripted as \\"The Case of the Ferrers\\" mentioned in \\"The Adventure of the Priory School\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Two Women\\" - post- scripted as \\"The Scandal of the Blackmailer\\" mentioned in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Deptford Horror\\" - post-scripted as two cases \\"The Sudden Death of Cardinal Tosca\\" and \\"Wilson the Notorious Canary- trainer\\" mentioned in \\"The Adventure of Black Peter\\" *\\"The Adventure of the Red Widow\\" - post-scripted as \\"The Arnsworth Castle Business\\" mentioned in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" The collaboration was not smooth, as Douglas G. Greene relates in John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles. There is some doubt about who wrote what‚Äîthough at times Carr's highly recognisable style breaks through the convention of pastiching the original Conan Doyle stories. In any case, the book published in 1954 was not a great success at the time, though collectors take an interest in it, and the experiment of writing more new Sherlock Holmes exploits was not repeated by these two writers. In 1963 John Murray published two paperback volumes which divided the stories into The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes by Adrian Conan Doyle and More Exploits of Sherlock Holmes by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr. The first title contains the last six stories listed above, the second the first six. Greene suggests that authorship may be more complex.

The water tower holds one million U.S. gallons (3.78541 million litres) of water and is located off Peachoid Road by Interstate 85 between exits 90 and 92 (near the Cherokee Foothills Scenic Highway). Usually referred to by locals as \\"The Peach\\" and by passing motorists as \\"Mr. Peach\\" or \\"The Moon over Gaffney\\", the water tank is visible for several miles around these exits. An example of novelty architecture, the Peachoid is one of the most recognizable landmarks for travelers along I-85 between Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia. History The water tower was built in 1981, by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company, of steel and concrete. An overlay stem and leaf were laid across the structure, an enormous \\"cleft\\" was created with steel paneling, and Peter Freudenberg, an artist who worked with macro-art, painted the structure to realistically resemble a peach. The foundation and sub-contract work was performed by Ford Construction Company of Selma, Alabama. The Peachoid was commissioned by the Gaffney Board of Public Works, who had a need for elevated water storage and wished to find a way of building it using federal funding. The shape of the peach was selected because the Gaffney economy was then dependent upon peach orchards, and because the people of the town wanted to make clear that South Carolina, and at one time, Cherokee County alone, where Gaffney is located, produced more peaches per year than the entire state of Georgia (known as the \\"Peach State\\"). Since its construction, the Peachoid's extremely high visibility has introduced an element of tourism to the local economy, and a smaller (500,000 U.S. gallons, 1.9 million liters) peachoid has been built for Clanton, Alabama by the same company. In February 2018, the Gaffney Board of Public Works installed a 6-foot tall chain-link security fence around the Peachoid in response to years of continued vandalism.https://www.thestate.com/news/state/article200843654.htmlhttps://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article200874019.htmlhttps://www.goupstate.com/news/20180216/why- has-6-foot-fence-been-installed-around- peachoidhttps://www.postandcourier.com/news/fence-put-up-around-famous-south- carolina-peach-water-tower/article_c1b24690-14de-11e8-8a9f-133a011d1c15.html In popular culture * The Peachoid was a focal plot point in Chapter 3 of House of Cards, where there was concern that the structure resembles female genitalia and/or buttocks. In the episode, Frank Underwood, as a native of Gaffney, keeps a photo of the Peachoid in his office, and it becomes the subject of a political and potentially legal battle for Frank after a young woman dies in a car accident, distracted by the Peachoid.

The far side's terrain is rugged with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria compared to the near side. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin. Both sides of the Moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night; even so, the far side is sometimes called the \\"dark side of the Moon\\", where \\"dark\\" is used to mean unseen rather than lacking sunlight. About 18 percent of the far side is occasionally visible from Earth due to libration. The remaining 82 percent remained unobserved until 1959, when it was photographed by the Soviet Luna 3 space probe. The Soviet Academy of Sciences published the first atlas of the far side in 1960. The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first humans to see the far side in person when they orbited the Moon in 1968. All manned and unmanned soft landings had taken place on the near side of the Moon, until 3 January 2019 when the Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side. Astronomers have suggested installing a large radio telescope on the far side, where the Moon would shield it from possible radio interference from Earth. Definition Due to tidal locking, the inhabitants of the central body (Earth) will never be able to see the satellite's (Moon) green area Tidal forces from Earth have slowed the Moon's rotation to the point where the same side is always facing the Earth‚Äîa phenomenon called tidal locking. The other face, most of which is never visible from the Earth, is therefore called the \\"far side of the Moon\\". Over time, some parts of the far side can be seen due to libration. In total, 59 percent of the Moon's surface is visible from Earth at one time or another. Useful observation of the parts of the far side of the Moon occasionally visible from Earth is difficult because of the low viewing angle from Earth (they cannot be observed \\"full on\\"). The phrase \\"dark side of the Moon\\" does not refer to \\"dark\\" as in the absence of light, but rather \\"dark\\" as in unknown: until humans were able to send spacecraft around the Moon, this area had never been seen. While many misconstrue this to think that the \\"dark side\\" receives little to no sunlight, in reality, both the near and far sides receive (on average) almost equal amounts of light directly from the Sun. However, the near side also receives sunlight reflected from the Earth, known as earthshine. Earthshine does not reach the area of the far side that cannot be seen from Earth. Only during a full Moon (as viewed from Earth) is the whole far side of the Moon dark. The word \\"dark\\" has expanded to refer also to the fact that communication with spacecraft can be blocked while the spacecraft is on the far side of the Moon, during Apollo space missions for example. Differences Detailed view by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) The Moon transits across the Earth as seen by the DSCOVR satellite, with its far side entirely visible The two hemispheres of the Moon have distinctly different appearances, with the near side covered in multiple, large maria (Latin for 'seas,' since the earliest astronomers incorrectly thought that these plains were seas of lunar water). The far side has a battered, densely cratered appearance with few maria. Only 1% of the surface of the far side is covered by maria, compared to 31.2% on the near side. One commonly accepted explanation for this difference is related to a higher concentration of heat- producing elements on the near-side hemisphere, as has been demonstrated by geochemical maps obtained from the Lunar Prospector gamma-ray spectrometer. While other factors, such as surface elevation and crustal thickness, could also affect where basalts erupt, these do not explain why the far side South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin (which contains the lowest elevations of the Moon and possesses a thin crust) was not as volcanically active as Oceanus Procellarum on the near side. It has also been proposed that the differences between the two hemispheres may have been caused by a collision with a smaller companion moon that also originated from the Theia collision. In this model, the impact led to an accretionary pile rather than a crater, contributing a hemispheric layer of extent and thickness that may be consistent with the dimensions of the far side highlands. However, the chemical composition of the far side is inconsistent with this model. The far side has more visible craters. This was thought to be a result of the effects of lunar lava flows, which cover and obscure craters, rather than a shielding effect from the Earth. NASA calculates that the Earth obscures only about 4 square degrees out of 41,000 square degrees of the sky as seen from the Moon. \\"This makes the Earth negligible as a shield for the Moon [and] it is likely that each side of the Moon has received equal numbers of impacts, but the resurfacing by lava results in fewer craters visible on the near side than the far side, even though both sides have received the same number of impacts.\\"Near-side/far-side impact crater counts by David Morrison and Brad Bailey, NASA. http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/?question=3318. Accessed Jan 9th, 2013. Newer research suggests that heat from Earth at the time when the Moon was formed is the reason the near side has fewer impact craters. The lunar crust consists primarily of plagioclases formed when aluminium and calcium condensed and combined with silicates in the mantle. The cooler, far side experienced condensation of these elements sooner and so formed a thicker crust; meteoroid impacts on the near side would sometimes penetrate the thinner crust here and release basaltic lava that created the maria, but would rarely do so on the far side. Exploration =Early exploration= The October 7, 1959, image by Luna 3 which revealed, for the first time, the far side of the Moon Until the late 1950s, little was known about the far side of the Moon. Librations of the Moon periodically allowed limited glimpses of features near the lunar limb on the far side, but only up to 59% of the total surface of the moon. These features, however, were seen from a low angle, hindering useful observation (It proved difficult to distinguish a crater from a mountain range). The remaining 82% of the surface on the far side remained unknown, and its properties were subject to much speculation. An example of a far side feature that can be seen through libration is the Mare Orientale, which is a prominent impact basin spanning almost , yet this was not even named as a feature until 1906, by Julius Franz in Der Mond. The true nature of the basin was discovered in the 1960s when rectified images were projected onto a globe. The basin was photographed in fine detail by Lunar Orbiter 4 in 1967. Before space exploration began, astronomers did not expect that the far side would be different from the side visible to Earth. On October 7, 1959, the Soviet probe Luna 3 took the first photographs of the lunar far side, eighteen of them resolvable, covering one-third of the surface invisible from the Earth. Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd. edition, entry on \\"–õ—É–Ω–∞ (—Å–ø—É—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ó–µ–º–ª–∏)\\", available online here The images were analysed, and the first atlas of the far side of the Moon was published by the USSR Academy of Sciences on November 6, 1960.–ê–¢–õ–ê–° –û–ë–†–ê–¢–ù–û–ô –°–¢–û–†–û–ù–´ –õ–£–ù–´, –ß. 1, Moscow: USSR Academy of Sciences, 1960 It included a catalog of 500 distinguished features of the landscape. Chronology, 1804‚Äì1980, to the 150th anniversary of GAISh ‚Äì Moscow State University observatory. MSU A year later, the first globe (1: scale) Moon maps and globes, created with the participation of Lunar and Planetary Research Department of SAI. SAI containing lunar features invisible from the Earth was released in the USSR, based on images from Luna 3. On July 20, 1965, another Soviet probe, Zond 3, transmitted 25 pictures of very good quality of the lunar far side, with much better resolution than those from Luna 3. In particular, they revealed chains of craters, hundreds of kilometers in length, but, unexpectedly, no mare plains like those visible from Earth with the naked eye. In 1967, the second part of the Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon was published in Moscow,Atlas Obratnoy Storony Luny, p.2, Moscow: Nauka, 1967 based on data from Zond 3, with the catalog now including 4,000 newly discovered features of the lunar far side landscape. In the same year, the first Complete Map of the Moon (1: scale) and updated complete globe (1: scale), featuring 95 percent of the lunar surface, were released in the Soviet Union. Moon Maps. MSU As many prominent landscape features of the far side were discovered by Soviet space probes, Soviet scientists selected names for them. This caused some controversy, and the International Astronomical Union, leaving many of those names intact, later assumed the role of naming lunar features on this hemisphere. =Further survey mission= On April 26, 1962, NASA's Ranger 4 space probe became the first spacecraft to impact the far side of the Moon, although it failed to return any scientific data before impact. The first truly comprehensive and detailed mapping survey of the far side was undertaken by the American unmanned Lunar Orbiter program launched by NASA from 1966 to 1967. Most of the coverage of the far side was provided by the final probe in the series, Lunar Orbiter 5. The far side was first seen directly by human eyes during the Apollo 8 mission in 1968. Astronaut William Anders described the view: It has been seen by all crew members of the Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 through Apollo 17 missions since that time, and photographed by multiple lunar probes. Spacecraft passing behind the Moon were out of direct radio communication with the Earth, and had to wait until the orbit allowed transmission. During the Apollo missions, the main engine of the Service Module was fired when the vessel was behind the Moon, producing some tense moments in Mission Control before the craft reappeared. Geologist- astronaut Harrison Schmitt, who became the last to step onto the Moon, had aggressively lobbied for his landing site to be on the far side of the Moon, targeting the lava-filled crater Tsiolkovskiy. Schmitt's ambitious proposal included a special communications satellite based on the existing TIROS satellites to be launched into a Farquhar‚ÄìLissajous halo orbit around the L2 point so as to maintain line-of-sight contact with the astronauts during their powered descent and lunar surface operations. NASA administrators rejected these plans on the grounds of added risk and lack of funding. The idea of utilizing Earth‚ÄìMoon for communications satellite covering the Moon's far side has been realized, as China National Space Administration launched Queqiao relay satellite in 2018. It has since been used for communications between the Chang'e 4 lander and yutu 2 rover that have successfully landed in early 2019 on the lunar far side and ground stations on the Earth. And L2 is proposed to be \\"an ideal location\\" for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot- based space transportation architecture. Chandrayaan-2, India's second lunar probe in 2019, captured images from far side terrain, Jackson (crater) and poles of the Moon. =Soft landing= The China National Space Administration's Chang'e 4 made the first ever soft landing on the lunar far side on 3 January 2019. The craft included a lander equipped with a low- frequency radio spectrograph and geological research tools. Potential Some of the features of the geography of the far side of the Moon are labeled in this image Because the far side of the Moon is shielded from radio transmissions from the Earth, it is considered a good location for placing radio telescopes for use by astronomers. Small, bowl-shaped craters provide a natural formation for a stationary telescope similar to Arecibo in Puerto Rico. For much larger-scale telescopes, the crater Daedalus is situated near the center of the far side, and the rim would help to block stray communications from orbiting satellites. Another potential candidate for a radio telescope is the Saha crater. Before deploying radio telescopes to the far side, several problems must be overcome. The fine lunar dust can contaminate equipment, vehicles, and space suits. The conducting materials used for the radio dishes must also be carefully shielded against the effects of solar flares. Finally, the area around the telescopes must be protected against contamination by other radio sources. The Lagrange point of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system is located about above the far side, which has also been proposed as a location for a future radio telescope which would perform a Lissajous orbit about the Lagrangian point. One of the NASA missions to the Moon under study would send a sample-return lander to the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin, the location of a major impact event that created a formation nearly across. The force of this impact has created a deep penetration into the lunar surface, and a sample returned from this site could be analyzed for information concerning the interior of the Moon. Because the near side is partly shielded from the solar wind by the Earth, the far side maria are expected to have the highest concentration of helium-3 on the surface of the Moon. This isotope is relatively rare on the Earth, but has good potential for use as a fuel in fusion reactors. Proponents of lunar settlement have cited the presence of this material as a reason for developing a Moon base.

His most well- known transformation is that of a microcassette recorder. Throughout most of his incarnations, he is an undyingly loyal lieutenant of the Decepticon leader Megatron. He is Megatron's eyes and ears and, in some interpretations, only speaks when mocking the Autobots. Transformers: Generation 1 Soundwave is one of the most recognizable characters from the original Transformers line, because of his alternate mode ‚Äì a microcassette recorder ‚Äì and his distinctive monotone, computerized voice. Soundwave is able to detect and jam transmissions across the entire energy spectrum, a talent that makes him suited to his position as Decepticon Communications Officer. Additionally, he has a photographic memory thanks to the vast data storage capacity of the magnetic disks in his chest compartment, and he is armed with a shoulder- mounted laser cannon and hand-held concussion blaster. Soundwave is physically strong compared to most Transformers. His alternative form - which involves an apparent loss of mass - is that of an Earthly microcassette deck. Within the tape compartment, which becomes his chest in robot mode, he stores a variety of Decepticon spies, all of which take the alternative form of a microcassette. These spy characters include Ravage, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw, Ratbat, Rumble, Frenzy, Slugfest, and Overkill, all of whom are under Soundwave's command in the original television series. Squawktalk and Beastbox were additional cassette characters under Soundwave's control in the US toyline, who were never shown in the cartoon. Soundwave's cassettes are quick to serve and defend Soundwave in a crisis, and generally relate to him as servants or even pets. However, when his cassette Ratbat became leader of the Decepticons in the Marvel Comics series, Soundwave fully shifted his trademark loyalty from Megatron to him. In the Dreamwave comics, Ratbat led the Ultracons faction, while Soundwave remained with the Decepticons led by Shockwave, although within that continuity these events occurred before Ratbat took up a cassette form. In the IDW comics, on pre-war Cybertron Soundwave functioned as personal assistant to Ratbat, who was a Senator at the time, however Soundwave's true loyalty lay with Megatron. When the time came for him and Starscream to massacre the Senate, he enslaved Ratbat by bestowing the smaller, weaker cassette body upon him. =Reception= According to X-Entertainment Soundwave was the top Transformers figure of all time.X-E - The Top 8 Transformers Figures Of All Time! =Animated series= Soundwave as a microcassette recorder In the original Transformers cartoon Soundwave was Megatron's right-hand mech, frequently sent on important reconnaissance missions with his cassettes, and often playing a key role in many schemes against the Autobots. On Cybertron, he used his ability to transform into a lamp-post to spy on the Autobot city of Iacon, learning of the Autobots' plan to search for energy on other worlds. Joining in Megatron's attack on the Autobots' craft, Soundwave fell to the same fate as the rest of the ship's occupants when the craft crashed on prehistoric Earth, entombing everyone within stasis. Immediately after the Transformers awakened on Earth in 1984, Soundwave played an essential role in the generation of energon cubes and the formation of plans for a new space cruiser to return the Decepticons to Cybertron. Later, he used his mind-reading talents to acquire an antimatter formula for the Decepticons from the brain of Chip Chase. He and his cassette minions were often on spying missions against the Autobots. One of Soundwave's most notable misadventures came in season 2 when, operating a plan conceived by Starscream, he brainwashed humans with ultrasonic vibrations, leading to a confrontation with his Autobot Communications Officer counterpart, Blaster, and to a lasting rivalry between the two. Soundwave rarely displayed much emotion, infrequently exhibiting any traits that could be considered to be in line with his tech spec. However, he showed distress when one of his cassettes were hurt in battle, and he always came across as extremely loyal to Megatron, even going so far as to recover his body after beaten close to death by Optimus Prime at the battle of Autobot City in 2005 (The Transformers: The Movie). But while Soundwave was loyal, he was far from outspoken, and kept silent when Megatron's body was subsequently ejected into space, and although he did suggest himself as a replacement leader (\\"Soundwave: superior. Constructicons: inferior.\\"), Soundwave again loyally served Megatron when he was reformatted as Galvatron. In season 3, although operating in a less prominent capacity for most of the time, Soundwave played a prominent role in Galvatron's attempt to learn the secret of a sonic weapon on the planet Eurythma, where sound and music were the way of life, leaving Soundwave entranced by the planet's perfect melodies. Recording each piece of the harmony that formed the devastating sonic effect, Soundwave was defeated when the Eurythmans countered the harmony with white noise, and was again pulled into a confrontation with Blaster, who erased his recordings. Soundwave made his final appearance in the American cartoon series, the Season 3 finale The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 1 as he was only seen giving the latest piece of information gathered by Ratbat that two scientists had discovered of Optimus Prime's body which made Galvatron to destroy once and for all. Although Soundwave only appeared as a background character in the American cartoon series finale, the three-part The Rebirth, he returned to the forefront in the new Japanese-exclusive series, Transformers: The Headmasters, which was created to replace The Rebirth. Reborn as Soundblaster (New Soundwave in the English version and Vizar in Italy) Soundwave's new toy incarnation was, like the series, available only in Japan. In the Transformers: The Headmasters, Soundwave and Blaster's rivalry had increased dramatically. In the opening cut and thrust of Headmasters, Soundwave and Blaster engaged in their final clash in the Arctic Circle as the Autobots and Decepticons were in the process of searching for the missing Autobot Matrix of Leadership. The two opponents inflicted fatal damage to each other, and Soundwave's body exploded even as Blaster collapsed. Soundwave's fragments were recovered by his cassettes. Using reconstructive technology from the planet Master, the leader of the Decepticon Headmasters, Zarak successfully rebuilt and resurrected Soundwave and renamed him Soundblaster‚Äîessentially identical to his former self, except for his predominantly black color scheme. As Soundblaster, he served the same role as he had as Soundwave under the leadership of Galvatron and later Scorponok, frequently embarking on spying missions with Ratbat. In Headmaster his character was somewhat changed to have a father-son relationship with the cassettes, as it was hinted on his resurrection as 'Soundblaster'. Soundwave was performed by Frank Welker, whose voice was heavily modulated by a vocoder to achieve Soundwave's distinctive, metallic monotone. However, Welker's voice was left unmodulated at certain points during the episodes \\"Roll for It\\" and \\"Webworld\\" due to production errors. This left him sounding like Dr. Claw, another role Welker performed, from Inspector Gadget. =Books= Soundwave appeared in the following books: * The 1984 sticker and story book Return to Cybertron written by Suzanne Weyn and published by Marvel Books. Oddly he was mistakenly depicted as an Autobot. * The 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called Dinobots Strike Back by Casey Todd. * The 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called Battle Drive by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel. * The 1985 Transformers audio books Autobots' Lightning Strike, Megatron's Fight For Power, Autobots Fight Back, Laserbeak's Fury and Satellite of Doom, as well as Galvatron's Air Attack from the 1986 series. * The 1985 audio story Sun Raid. * The 1986 story and coloring book The Lost Treasure of Cybertron by Marvel Books. =Comics= 3H Enterprises He also appeared in the Furman written Reaching the Omega Point, as one of the Transformers legends (alongside Optimus Prime, Megatron and Grimlock) who came to the aid of the forces of Optimus Primal against the Predacon/Unicron hybrid Shokaract, distracting him long enough for Primus to deal the fatal blow. Devil's Due Publishing In Devil's Due's run of G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers comic book miniseries, Soundwave was among the Transformers captured by the ruthless terrorist Cobra Organization, when they discovered the Ark. Refitted by Destro, Soundwave was intended to become a battlefield communications station, but when he and the other Decepticons eventually broke free of their control he was damaged in a battle with the Autobots and his parts were captured by the US Government for study. From his data banks, the android SerpentO.R. downloaded information on the history of Cybertron, using it to further the Decepticon goal of conquest. It is indicated that his pre-Earth form was similar to his Dreamwave War Within form. Dreamwave Productions In Dreamwave's 21st century re-imagining of the Generation 1 continuity, Soundwave was recruited to the Decepticons 9 million years ago through Megatron's underground gladiatorial games, and made head of communications. When a new Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, was chosen, Soundwave was sent along with the Insecticons and Ravage, to attempt to kill him and recover the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for Megatron, but they failed, forcing Megatron to confront Optimus personally. Even in the face of failures such as this, and later the loss of Megatron in an early space bridge experiment, Soundwave's loyalty to the Decepticon cause never wavered, as he remained true to the faction under Shockwave's leadership. As in most other continuities, the story continues in the traditional manner, with Soundwave a member of the Nemesis crew who attacked the Ark and was sent into stasis when the craft crashed on Earth, awakening again in 1984. After years of fighting on Earth, eventually the combined forces of the Autobots and their human allies were able to defeat and capture the Decepticons. The intent was for the Autobots to take their enemies back to Cybertron aboard a new craft named the Ark II, but just as the ship cleared the atmosphere, it exploded, the victim of machinations by Shockwave, who did not want Prime and Megatron to return to Cybertron yet. Soundwave's body crashed back to Earth in the Arctic, where he lay inactive for several years, until rogue military scientist Adam Rook, calling himself \\"Lazarus,\\" recovered and reactivated him, putting him under his control with a program he had developed while studying the Transformers before their explosive departure. Several other Autobots and Decepticons fell to the same fate, and were to be sold on the black market‚ÄîSoundwave himself was put on display by being sent to attack the Smitco Oil Refinery alongside several other Transformers‚Äîbut when Megatron liberated himself, Soundwave was soon freed by his leader and assumed his position at his side. When Shockwave arranged for the capture and extradition of Prime and Megatron's forces as war criminals, Soundwave was among the captives, but when Starscream jettisoned Megatron into space on the return trip to Cybertron, Soundwave made the best of a bad lot and teamed with Starscream to return to Earth and conquer it, being reunited with Ratbat in the process. Heading back to Earth in a kidnapped Sky Lynx and with the Combaticons now added to their ranks, the Decepticons attacked the Ark in hopes of acquiring parts to make the Nemesis spaceworthy again, however Soundwave, Skywarp and Thundercracker were defeated and thrown in the Ark's brig. When the Combaticons, combined as Bruticus, laid into the vessel, they were freed. It was not much later that the surviving Megatron made contact with Soundwave from space, and Soundwave was all too willing to return to his service, setting up Starscream to fall before Megatron when he returned. And return, Megatron did‚Äîbut the bankruptcy and subsequent closure of Dreamwave left the rest of the story untold. Soundwave also appeared in the Dreamwave Transformers/G.I. Joe series as one of the Decepticons uncovered by Cobra at the start of the World War II. Transforming into a radio, he was deactivated at the series' close by Grimlock. Although Dreamwave's collapse precluded the completion of the second series, released art and information revealed that Soundwave would have been involved in the conclusion of that series. Fun Publications Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). Megatron survived the crash of the Ark on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form and now leads Astrotrain, Laserbeak, Ramjet, Ravage, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod). When the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away. Soundwave was among Megatron's troops when Megatron defeated Deathsaurus in combat for leadership of the Decepticons and when Megatron attacked Iacon with his new weapon, Devastator. IDW Publishing Soundwave's first chronological appearance in the rebooted IDW Publishing Generation One universe was in the prequel miniseries, The Transformers: Megatron Origin. In the story, Soundwave works for Senator Ratbat, who takes an interest in the rising gladiator, Megatron. Ratbat sends Soundwave to offer weaponry to Megatron and his followers. Soundwave also assists Megatron with the interrogation of Autobot soldier, Bumper. Soundwave is later jailed along with Megatron and other when Sentinel Prime's forces capture them, but is released by Ratbat. When Megatron's plan is sprung, Soundwave helps Starscream massacre the Autobot Senate. He later confronts Ratbat and forcibly extracts his Spark for implantation in one of his Cassette bodies. Soundwave's alternate mode appears to be a communication vehicle with tank treads. Sometime later, Soundwave was part of the conference of scientists called by Thunderwing in The Transformers: Stormbringer, where he refuses to accept Thunderwing's findings that Cybertron was dying. In around the same time period he had Beachcomber captured and implanted with a cerebro-shell, having the unwilling traitor eject his opposite number Blaster into space (in Spotlight Blaster) in order to demoralize the Autobots prior to a Decepticon offensive. Soundwave's story was later continued in his own Spotlight one-shot, where he was a self-serving and duplicitous Decepticon internal affairs agent. Soundwave was dispatched by Megatron to keep an eye on Bludgeon's investigation of Shockwave's lab. However, he kept quiet about Bludgeon's obsession with the Regenesis project, thinking he could turn it to his advantage. Following him to Earth in 1984, Soundwave monitored Bludgeon's attempts to harvest Ultra Energon and confronted him after he'd acquired it. Horrified to discover they were not planning to use it in a power-play but instead to reanimate Thunderwing (who previously devastated Cybertron), Soundwave attempted to stop them but was trapped in stasis-lock in cassette player mode. It was revealed in the epilogue that two young humans considered buying him at a pawn shop in 2007. In The Transformers: Escalation #1, Optimus stated there was evidence that Soundwave had been present in Earth's history. Despite this, he did not reappear until issue #4 of The Transformers: Devastation, where, still trapped in cassette player mode, he interfered with Skywatch's control of Laserbeak and Ravage. Soundwave also appeared as one of the Decepticon forces, serving under Starscream in the out-of-continuity The Transformers: Evolutions tale \\"Hearts of Steel\\". He appeared as one of Starscream's lieutenants. He was presumably destroyed when John Henry and Bumblebee diverted the Decepticon train convoy into a chasm. Marvel Comics Like much of the original 1984 cast of Decepticons, Soundwave played a much smaller role in the Marvel book series than he did in the cartoon. He quietly and efficiently served loyally, first under Megatron (even sending Ravage and the Insecticons to derail talks between the Autobots and Ronald Reagan at one point in the 1985 Transformers UK annual), then under Shockwave, attacking an aerospace construction plant whose facilities were used to build the Constructicons, who then built a massive radio dish that Soundwave used to beam a message back to Cybertron. Continuing to operate under Shockwave, Soundwave then moved to serving Ratbat, and co-led the defense of Buenos Aires against the Underbase-empowered Starscream alongside Fortress Maximus, only to wind up deactivated by the villain. Unlike many of the others deactivated by Starscream, Soundwave would appear again, under Scorponok's command. Throughout the U.S. comic, Soundwave was colored purple instead of his more trademark blue, and additionally was frequently drawn with a visible mouth. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic in the UK, a sister title to the American series was also in production. It reprinted the American stories, but as it was released on a weekly (as opposed to monthly) schedule, it soon began to run out of material to reprint. It opted to create its own original stories at that point, which deftly weaved in and out of the ongoing American storyline. Under writer Simon Furman, Soundwave‚Äîcoloured-blue was a fairly major player, portrayed in a manner much more consistent with his profile - that of a manipulator and blackmailer, reading others' minds and using their secrets to his own ends, always working towards his own goals. When Megatron and Shockwave were both briefly believed deceased, he assumed leadership of the Decepticons during Optimus Prime's Crisis of Command and then the Dinobot Hunt story arcs, manipulating events to weaken the Autobot leadership and cause maximum casualties. When the two commanders returned and vied for leadership of the Decepticons, he turned the situation to his own advantage by working both sides of the field. He also enjoyed a rare victory in this period when he, Dirge and Kickback took over a NASA complex in an attempt to contact Cybertron with the facility's deep space radio equipment. The Autobots arrived, but a series of miscommunications between Prowl and Jetfire resulted in the transmission being sent, allowing the Decepticons to claim victory. Towards the end of the UK series, a storyline began which separated from the regular ongoing American continuity, covering the exploits of the proactive Autobot Earthforce. In these stories, Soundwave sold Decepticon secrets to both the Autobots and Shockwave's group of Decepticons. Wildrider was blamed for this intelligence leak, and Soundwave silently allowed him to be killed rather than be discovered. After Starscream successfully removed Megatron and Shockwave from power, he and Soundwave entered into joint leadership of the Decepticons. Issue #279 of the Marvel UK Transformers comic featured a story called \\"Divide and Conquor!\\" where Soundwave lead the bulk of the Decepticon forces on Earth against the Autobot Earthforce headquarters while Starscream attacked an oil tanker. Sent into battle by Prowl, the Dinobots routed the main Decepticon forces while Springer lead the Autobot Survivors, Broadside, Inferno, Skids, and Carnivac to defeat Starscream. Soundwave attained leadership of the Decepticons in the future world of 2008, following the death of Shockwave (who had seized power when Galvatron traveled back in time). Soundwave led his era's Decepticons back to 1989 to participate in the Time Wars when the fabric of reality began to crumble, but as the conflict came to a head they fled back to their own time. Since it was later established that the damage done to the time stream may have resulted in their future being erased from the timeline, the final fate of the future Soundwave is unknown. Soundwave returned to the pages of the US Transformers comic books for the relaunch of the series as Transformers: Generation 2. He participated in the Decepticon attack on Earth, and oversaw the reconstruction of the damaged Darkwing into a new, more powerful form. Like many of the other Generation 1 Decepticons, Soundwave seemed to return to a command position on Megatron's return (killing Bludgeon in the process). Soundwave made an appearance in the Decepticon forces under the command of Megatron in issue #7 of the Marvel Generation 2 comic series, in a story called \\"New Dawn.\\" Megatron lead his Decepticons against Jhiaxus' second generation Cybertronians near the moon of Tykos. The Decepticons were defeated and Megatron left injured, presumed dead, but swearing revenge. He was aboard the Warworld when Jhiaxus' forces attacked, but managed to evacuate. His fate within the Generation 2 comic series beyond this point is unknown. Soundwave would also play a brief but important role in the text-only novel, Alignment, writer Simon Furman's take on what happened after the Transformers: Generation 2 comic series ended. He was the one who recovered Megatron's broken body after his duel with Galvatron. Subsequently, he was the ringleader of the conspirators (along with Ravage, Ramjet and Direwolf) who gave some of their spark energy to resurrect Megatron in a more powerful body, allowing him to defeat the forces of the Liege Maximo. After Megatron executes the Decepticon High Council save Shrapnel, Soundwave once again acted as Megatron's second in command and coordinated the strike against the Maximo with Ultra Magnus. His fate beyond this is unknown, save for a brief cameo in Beast Machines. Soundwave as depicted in the Marvel Universe tends to be the most intellectual and philosophical of the Decepticons. He is appalled by the barbarity of Megatron and Shockwave battling in hand-to-hand combat for leadership of the Decepticons, especially as the entire spectacle is being broadcast on live television for human entertainment by Robo-Master. When the future Autobots and Decepticons join forces and repel an alien invasion of Cybertron he begins to propose a lasting truce to Ultra Magnus but stops himself, observing that too much has occurred between the 2 factions and their differences are irreconcilable. TFcon comics Soundwave appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play Bee for, Bee now.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBTlU6PT9LA&feature;=relmfu =Other appearances= A parody of the Generation 1 Transformers was aired in the December 23rd 2008 episode of Frank TV, called \\"Frank the Halls\\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city. Soundwave appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Toy Meets Girl\\" voiced by Seth Green. He is portrayed as having retired from the Decepticon army and obtained honest employment as a transformable portable toilet. Frank Welker reprises his role of Soundwave (as well as Megatron but not Rumble) when he appears again in another Robot Chicken episode \\"Werewolf vs. Unicorn\\" where in the current years it's revealed that because the audio cassette tape and cassette players have long become obsolete and therefore no longer widely used, that his spy tactics now do not work (the people who discovered him in the skit were laughing at his mixtape which was Rumble being killed by them puling his tape out). He is later found by Megatron and Shockwave to be on sale on eBay with options to place a bid for 500 dollars or \\"Buy it now\\" for 1000 dollars, whereupon Shockwave exclaims \\"Request permission to buy it now!\\" The Commemorative Soundwave figure was used in \\"Werewolf vs. Unicorn.\\" Soundwave made a cameo appearance in the Family Guy episode \\"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\\" as Peter's new supervisor. In it, Soundwave releases a framed photograph from his cassette deck cavity, of himself and a human woman named Denise, who Soundwave proclaims is his wife, whom he met in a Christian chat room. Soundwave also appears in the Sealab 2021 episode \\"Hail, Squishface\\" as a toy on an Asian girl's cart, who sells Capt. Murphy Gloop, from the show The Herculoids. A music video featuring Soundwave and a robot similar to Rumble and Frenzy named Lazer (though purely white in colour) breakdancing has surfaced throughout the Internet since 2000. The video contains audio clips from both the animated series and The Transformers: The Movie alongside music. In 2007, shortly before the release of the live-action Transformers film, Soundwave appeared in the viral comedy short \\"Soundwave: The Touch.\\" =Toys= * Generation 1 Soundwave (1984) :The original Soundwave toy (and his cassettes) began life as part of Takara's Micro Change line, designed by Satoshi Koizumi, featuring household objects that transformed into accurately-scaled robots. Incorporated into the Transformers toy line by Hasbro, the figure was packaged with Buzzsaw in the US, and with Rumble in Japan (also including a set of non-functional headphones). The tapes could fit into Soundwave's opening chest door (released by a push of his shoulder-mounted \\"eject\\" button), while the interaction level was maintained by his two guns, which turned into AA-sized batteries that could store in a compartment in his back. Cassette tapes that could interact with Soundwave were released regularly until 1988. The Soundwave toy was reissued in Japan in 2004, and in the U.S. in 2006 using the Soundblaster mold. * Generation 1 Soundblaster (1987) :A re-mold of the Soundwave toy exclusive to Japan, Soundblaster is cast in black plastic where Soundwave was blue, with a retooled chest door, now made of translucent red plastic and able to hold two cassettes at once. Soundblaster came with a variant edition of Buzzsaw, who had a special sticker on his body that, when viewed through Soundblaster's door, would reveal the weak spots of Fortress Maximus. Soundblaster was reissued in Japan in 2005. * Generation 1 Action Master Soundwave (1990) :The non-transforming Action Master incarnation of Soundwave came packaged with a transforming partner named Wingthing, who could become a gun for Soundwave to wield. * Generation 2 Go-Bot Soundwave (1995) :The Marvel Comics Generation 2 series concluded before it could feature the Generation 2 toy line's new, distinctly different version of Soundwave from 1995 - a fluorescent yellow, blue and pink Ford Thunderbird stock car Go-Bot, a re-deco of an earlier figure named Gearhead. The figure was later recolored into W.A.R.S. for Transformers: Robots in Disguise. * Generation 2 Laser Cycle Soundwave (unreleased) :Plans existed to repaint the Laser Cycle, Road Pig, into a version of Soundwave featuring his classic color scheme, but the figure was never released. * Machine Wars Soundwave (1997) :1997's Machine Wars toy line, released exclusively in KB Toy stores, featured Soundwave as a repaint of the 1992 European and Canadian exclusive figure, Stalker. The toy transforms into a missile tank and, colored in shades of black, gray and maroon, resembled Soundwave only through a similar head sculpt, and a shoulder-mounted weapon, in this case, an electron rocket. His tech spec, however, was clearly based on that of the original Soundwave toy's, with an additional mention of a new nickname for this version of the character: \\"The Terror Tank.\\" * Transtech Soundwave (unreleased) :With the conclusion of the Beast Machines toy line, the initial plan for a follow-up was through the futuristic Transtech series. Although the idea was scrapped in favor of Transformers: Armada, Toronto-based design studio Draxhall Jump produced several designs for characters, including Soundwave. * Smallest Transformers Soundwave with Jaguar (2003) :Part of the first wave of the Japan-only Smallest Transformers toy line. Despite the small size (roughly 2 inches in robot height), the toy is virtually faithful to the original G1 toy in design and transformation. Soundwave also comes with a micro cassette that transforms into Ravage.TFW2005.com - WST Soundwave with Jaguar :In 2006, this toy was to be released with a redeco of Energon Megatron as a Target exclusive in the U.S., but plans to release the toy were canceled.TFW2005.com - Megatron with Mini Soundwave (Unreleased) * Universe Soundwave with Space Case (2004) :A redeco of Soundwave's Machine Wars figure, this toy was rendered in shades of blue and yellow, and packaged with fellow Decepticon Space Case. * Classics Commemorative Soundwave (2007) :A Toys \\"R\\" Us exclusive is said to be near identical to the original toy. This however has one difference from that of the 1984 figure, being that the chest compartment (tape deck door) has been re-molded to hold two cassette Transformers as opposed to one. This version of Soundwave is actually a 'reverse repaint' of the Japanese-exclusive Soundblaster, himself a retooling of the original Soundwave. Commemorative Soundwave includes both Ravage and Laserbeak, two cassettes seen prominently in the original series. * Titanium 6 inch Soundwave with Laserbeak (2007) :Two versions of Generation 1 Soundwave were released in the Transformers: Titanium toy line. One was a 3-inch non-transforming version in robot mode. The other is a transformable 6-inch version that transforms into a cassette deck. Both Soundwave's feature die cast metal and plastic parts, and the 6-inch version also includes a transformable Laserbeak. It is also rumored that the larger version would be repainted and released as Soundblaster along with Ravage. * Attacktix Soundwave (2007) :Series 2 of the Transformers Attacktix figures included a Generation 1 Soundwave figure. * Music Label Soundwave (2007) :An MP3 player designed to look like the Generation 1 Soundwave figure. MiniSD cards fit inside his chest compartment, and comes with the shoulder gun, blaster, and alternate hands for holding the gun, making fists, and his \\"eject\\" finger. Uses 1 AAA battery. Despite the claim on the box, it can use at least up to a 2 GB memory card and play songs over 128kbit/s. In robot mode, he is the same size as Titanium Soundwave, though in \\"Cassette\\" mode he is longer and slightly taller. There are also headphones that are sold separately designed to look like Soundwave's minions Rumble and Frenzy. :Soundwave is available in three colors: Sonic White, Spark Blue (which closely resembles his original G1 incarnation) and Blaster Black (an homage to Soundblaster). :This figure was voted the 43rd top toy released in the last 10 years by ToyFare Magazine.ToyFare Magazine issue #122 * Transformers Encore Reissue Soundwave (2007) :A release by Takara Tomy in Japan that is nearly identical to the original 1984 toy. Unlike the original 1984 release that was packaged with Buzzsaw, the Encore figure was packaged with Laserbeak. * Mighty Muggs Soundwave (2008) :A Mighty Muggs doll of Soundwave with gun. * Universe 25th Anniversary Soundwave (2009) :A San Diego Comic-Con International exclusive reissue of the original G1 Soundwave figure that comes with Buzzsaw, Laserbeak, Ravage and Ratbat.TFW2005.com - 25th Anniversary Soundwave * Classics Deluxe Soundwave (unreleased) :Although no new mold was released for Classics Soundwave (they instead reused the Takara Soundblaster mold), a design for a new Soundwave toy that turned into a SUV was considered. This design seems to have inspired Animated Soundwave. * Masterpiece MP-13 Soundwave (2012) :An all-new mold of Soundwave in Takara Tomy's Masterpiece line. Comes packaged with Condor/Laserbeak, collapsible weapons that transform into batteries, a clear Energon cube that can attach to his chest, a detachable display grid, a forearm scanner attachment, a translucent pink cassette case and a new version of the Megatron gun originally offered in MP-01 Convoy/Optimus Prime. Aside from holding up to three newer Masterpiece cassette robots, Soundwave's chest can also accommodate the original G1 cassettes. Laserbeak in bird mode can peg on Soundwave's left shoulder or forearm. Beast Wars A character named Soundwave‚Äîbut with no relation to the original character‚Äîwas released as part of the Beast Wars Mutants sub-line in 2000. As a Mutant, this Soundwave transforms from bat to alligator, with no humanoid mode. Due to his in-built radar in bat mode, and crushing jaws in alligator mode, he excels at a variety of missions. However, due to his situation, Soundwave is a dark and bitter character. He has an ultra-sensitive internal radar in bat mode, and in alligator mode, his tail can send seismic shockwaves through the ground. =IDW Publishing= This version of Soundwave also appeared in IDW Publishing's Beast Wars: The Gathering miniseries. Activated on Earth by Magmatron and a group of Predacons from the future, Soundwave and the mutants emerged from their stasis pods and took up residence in a swamp that they quickly made their own. When a group newly activated Predacons led by Transquito ventured through the swamp on a mission they were attacked by the Mutants. Poison Bite attacked Retrax, Soundwave attacked Powerpinch and Icebird attacked Transquito. Deciding the swamp was not worth their lives, Scourge and Insecticon fled. However, in \\"The Ascending\\" it is revealed that Powerpinch, Transquito and Retrax survived. IDW's Beast Wars Sourcebook series identifies the mutant Soundwave as a former warrior who may have been a veteran of the Great War, though the details are ambiguous at best. Sourcebook #4 states that Soundwave became an actor/entertainer after the ratification of the Pax Cybertronia, developing a \\"dramatic flair in everything from his movements to his speech paterns\\". =3H Enterprises= In Transformers: Universe - The Wreckers the Mutants traveled to Cybertron and sought the guidance of the Oracle computer, seeking a cure for their condition. What they did not know is that the Oracle was under the influence of the Quintessons. The Mutants were sent to the outer Orion Cluster. Once there they were captured by the Quintessons, found in contempt by the five- faced aliens, and destroyed in an attack by a swarm of Sharkticons. =Toys= * Beast Wars Deluxe Mutant Soundwave (2000) :Although the Beast Wars toy line had concluded in 1998, this sub-line was released during the Beast Machines era. Although the figures lack robot modes, they all feature vestigial robotic components‚Äîsuch as Soundwave's robot head, concealed within his bat mouth. A re-deco of the figure known as Leatherneck was intended for release in Transformers: Universe, but did not come to fruition. :This figure was based on drawings by Hasbro designer Tim Bradley. Transformers: Cybertron In Transformers: Cybertron, Soundwave's origins are greatly altered. While in the original G1 continuity, he was a native of Cybertron like Megatron and Starscream, this incarnation of Soundwave is the second Transformer from the mysterious Planet X. This is also the first incarnation to have an actual vehicle mode. He transforms into a Planet X Jet (bearing a resemblance to a stealth bomber) and is partnered with a smaller robot called Laserbeak (Killer Condor in Japan). In the English dub of this series, he has a synthesized voice, albeit more human than his G1 counterpart, which is counterbalanced by his tendency to speak like a modern disc jockey‚Äîusing terms like \\"He got served\\" and \\"Peace out, bots\\" and calling the battlefield, \\"The Floor\\", giving him more of a personality than his normally emotionless G1 counterpart. This version of Soundwave is unique in comparison to any other incarnation, as while in most other continuities, outside of the Armada trilogy, Soundwave was Megatron's most loyal soldier, this Soundwave has no true loyalty towards the Decepticon leader. The package bio for Soundwave mentions that Planet X itself may be a total deception, and that it is actually a term the agents use to refer to their service to Unicron. Although he and Sideways are the survivors of a dead civilization, they actually serve Unicron throughout space and time as his heralds in taking over new worlds to replace his loss of previous forms. Soundwave is armed with two cannons, and can hide himself behind holograms when working in conjunction with Laserbeak. =Animated series= Soundwave first makes his appearance in the episode Titan, offering to lead Megatron and his minions to the planet Gigantion, however in a scene featuring Sideways and Starscream aboard the Atlantis a purple cassette player with the Decepticon symbol is on board playing music to ease the tension between the two evil robots. It is not clear if this is Soundwave or not, but it is interesting that he appeared in \\"Titan\\" just a few episodes later. In his first encounter with the Autobots he fought Optimus Prime and Wing Saber in their Sonic Wing mode and was able to hold his own in combat until Megatron was defeated by Metroplex and the Decepticons retreated. Shortly after they arrived on Gigantion and there Megatron was upgraded into Galvatron, Soundwave abandoned the Decepticons, and joined up with his counterpart, Sideways. During a battle with the Autobot Cybertron Defense Team, he revealed the history of his world, and how they desired the Cyber Planet Keys to get revenge on the inhabitants of Gigantion. Later, he and Sideways attempted to intervene in the epic battle between Galvatron and Starscream in order to claim the Planet Keys and Omega Lock, only to be sent into another universe by the distortion caused by the two fighters' conflict. However, Soundwave would appear later, when Starscream reached out to Galvatron across dimensions, seemingly trapped along with him and Sideways. However, Starscream seemed to have returned by the series' end, while Soundwave and Sideways were shown to have found a dimension where Planet X still existed. Soundwave is the only major transformer in the series who never summons his Cyber Key. In his toy version, his Cyber Key opens his chest compartment to store Laserbeak or one of his two cannons. In his first appearance to the Autobots, Soundwave demonstrates the ability to do this without the aid of a Cyber Key. G1 Soundwave makes a cameo appearance in the animated series as a blue boombox that Sideways used to hear music. =Fun Publications= The Cybertron incarnation of Soundwave was among the characters to appear in the comic strip published exclusively through the Transformers Collectors Club, arriving on the planet itself to observe Vector Prime, Sentinel Maximus and Omega Prime after their defeat of Unicron's heralds, Nemesis Prime and Ramjet, and capture of the Dead Matrix. Dispatching Laserbeak to recover the Dead Matrix from its place in storage, Soundwave threw the talisman into the black hole that had been created by the collapse of Unicron, allowing the Chaos Bringer's Spark to escape and infiltrate the planet Yst, which he corrupted and transformed into his new body. Soundwave would link up with his master, and watch the unfolding carnage of a Mini-Con civil war. However, when Unicron chose that moment to attack, Soundwave was attacked by several Mini-Cons, including Scythe and Perceptor. Unable to hit the smaller Mini-Cons, Soundwave fled with Unicron when Primus awoke. =Toys= * Cybertron Voyager Soundwave (2005) :The first actual homage to the original Soundwave in modern times, the Cybertron toy transforms not into a tape deck, but a sleek alien stealth fighter. Beyond this, however, the nods to the original character are many, from his head design, his multi-barreled shoulder cannon to his opening chest door, activated by his Cyber Key. Soundwave comes with a new incarnation of Laserbeak, who transforms into a battery bomb that can store within Soundwave's chest compartment. This toy was recolored into Universe Blaster. This toy was based on an F-117 Nighthawk. * Galaxy Force Voyager Soundblaster :A black repaint of Soundwave, predictably named Soundblaster, was released exclusively in Japan through Takara's \\"Toy's Dream Project\\" series. However this Soundblaster is a separate character from Soundwave. * Cybertron Legends Soundwave (2006) :A Micro class Soundwave was released in the third wave of the Legends of Cybertron toy line. It came without Laserbeak. In 2007 a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toy was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave. All identical to their original releases. Transformers Cinematic Universe =Films= In Revenge of the Fallen, Soundwave spends his time hovering above Earth in orbit. He receives a message from Wheelie about Mikaela Banes possessing a shard of the Allspark and orders him to retrieve it. Docking onto a satellite and hacking it, Soundwave intercepts information on the location of Megatron's corpse and the Allspark shard. He deploy his servant Ravage to retrieve the shard and sent the Constructicons to rendezevous at Megatron's resting place. After the death of Optimus Prime, Soundwave carried out Megatron's orders to prepare the Decepticons for the invasion of Earth. While coordinating attacks, Soundwave located Sam Witwicky's parents in Paris, France, and called Judy Witwicky via her cell phone. He demanded she tell him where Sam was, but Judy did not take him seriously, believing him to be a pervert caller, and hung up. He later intercepted calls from the Egyptian government on Sam's location, and informed the other Decepticons. Soundwave did not take part in the last battle, although Ravage did and was killed by Bumblebee. Frank Welker returned to reprise his role as Soundwave in this movie, and the film following after. but unlike his G1 counterpart, his voice was not vocoded, which the character was well known for. In Dark of the Moon, Soundwave is revealed to have been on Earth since the 1970s. He discovered the Autobot spaceship, the Ark on the Moon, and forcibly recruited various human servants from the U.S. and Russian space agencies to prevent further exploration of it following the initial Moon landings, while he ordered an army of Decepticons to steal most of the pillars onboard and hide under the moon's surface. In the modern day he appears at Megatron's base in Africa, where he and Laserbeak report the Autobot's recovery of Sentinel Prime and the remaining pillars from the crashed Ark. Megatron praises Soundwave's initiative in the decades-long plan and orders Laserbeak to kill their human allies. The only human ally they don't kill, Dylan Gould, has Soundwave disguise himself as a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG that belonged to Sam's girlfriend, Carly, in order to get close to the Autobots. He reveals himself and captures Carly once the two humans learn of Gould's alliance with the Decepticons, and threatens her in order to convince Sam to discover the Autobot's plans. During the battle in Chicago, Soundwave and Barricade lead several Decepticons in capturing some of the Autobots. Gould convinces Soundwave not to take prisoners, and Soundwave orders the others to execute their \\"trophies\\". Once Que is dead, Soundwave prepares to kill Bumblebee himself, but a Decepticon battle-cruiser hijacked by Wheelie and Brains drops fighters near Soundwave, distracting him and allowing the Autobots to fight back. Bumblebee attacks Soundwave who tries to shoot him, but is confused among the crushing ships and shoots the other Decepticons. He throws Bumblebee, but Bumblebee then slays Soundwave by sticking his cannon into Soundwave's chest and shooting upwards. This causes Soundwave's head to disintegrate, killing him instantly. In Bumblebee, Soundwave is seen on Cybertron along with Shockwave and Starscream commanding the decepticons in the war against the Autobots. He apparently manages to capture Optimus Prime with the help of a small army and Ravage and then Prime escapes from them. =Creation and development= Almost from the moment the live action Transformers movie was announced in 2007, producer Don Murphy and the production team made it clear they did not want to feature mass/size shifting in transformation (excluding the Allspark), due to concerns over realism. With this process an inherent part of Soundwave's tape deck alternate mode, there was some discussion over whether or not to change it due to its obsolescence, or to include the character in the film at all. It was announced by Hasbro at SDCC 2004 that movie Soundwave would be a helicopter. Early leaked movie scripts proposed that his alternate mode would be a helicopter, but animatics shown at the 2005 Comic Con were poorly received. This led to a rethink, with the eventual helicopter character rechristened as Vortex, then finally Blackout. 2006 script reviews named Soundwave as a spying boombox on Air Force One, able to transform into a small robot, but eventually, this character was amended to being Frenzy, with Don Murphy stating that Soundwave will be reserved for a future sequel, until they can \\"do him right\\". When the film was released on DVD a special on-line content from Best Buy showed early animation footage of Blackout as a blue helicopter with a head that resembled Soundwave. In a USA Today online fan poll, Soundwave was one of the 10 Transformers that the fans wanted in the sequel, winning with 20% of the votes. Soundwave appears in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Soundwave is a satellite in the film, and he is also a Triple changer as he has the form of a Cybertronian jet as well. Soundwave is not seen in his robot form in the film. Frank Welker reprised his voicing role, and used his Doctor Claw voice from Inspector Gadget, which, when run through a vocoder, gives Soundwave his unique voice from the original animated series. The lack of this vocoder in the 2009 film left the voice sounding more like Doctor Claw than the original Soundwave. He has his minion Ravage to do his bidding in the film. Soundwave also appears in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, this time transforming into a Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and with Laserbeak to serve him. Soundwave is armed with sonic cannons. His Hasbro Battle Bio states that he is 22 feet tall and that his main weapons are sonic cannons which can only be used in the atmosphere, as sound waves will not travel in vacuum. Soundwave also makes a brief appearance in the movie Bumblebee. His appearance closely matches his G1 counterpart and appears alongside Shockwave and Starscream (a non speaking role). He is voiced by Jon Bailey, who also voices Shockwave in the film. =Other media= Comic books In issue #4 of Transformers: Defiance, it is revealed that the reason for Soundwave to have believed to have been dead is because he was on the Decepticons ship that The Fallen was commanding, and that all of its crew were missing by the time Megatron noticed the emergency signal emitting from the ship while he was chasing the Allspark. Soundwave first appeared in issue #2 of Transformers: Alliance where he arrived at the crash site of the Nemesis on Mars. There he found Dreadwing's head, as well as the body of Frenzy, then contacted Starscream and told him to rally to his signal. Starscream was surprised to hear from Soundwave, as he had been believed dead for years. Soundwave deployed a number of his forces on Earth, leaving others on his ship. In Tales of the Fallen #5 Soundwave, still in orbit after the events of the 2009 film, notices someone has reactivated Ravage. Soundwave appears in Transformers: Nefarious #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes. In \\"Nefarious\\" #2, Soundwave sent Dirt Boss, Reverb, and Brakedown to Wendover, Utah to find an \\"Initiative\\" facility. Soundwave then contacted Ravage in order to discover how he was resurrected. Then, he proceeded to assist Reverb, Dirt Boss, and Brakedown, in a fight with the Autobots. After a battle with Optimus Prime, Soundwave convinces the Autobot leader to join forces temporarily, in order to find \\"the Initiative\\". Novels In the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen coloring book Soundwave is depicted hacking into a military satellite. Television In Cyber Missions #1, Soundwave successfully infiltrates the NEST command base (in his satellite mode, oddly), which is guarded by Bumblebee. Soundwave transforms and smashes the screen projecting Optimus Prime and engages the Autobot. Bumblebee fires a shot, but Soundwave sends it back to Bumblebee as a sonic boom. Bumblebee then fires several more rounds with Soundwave frantically trying to absorb all the bullets, but is finally blown backwards. In Cyber Missions #2, Bumblebee trapped Soundwave in a vacuum-sealed electromagnetic bubble, rendering his abilities useless. Video games Like the movie, Soundwave coordinates the mission to the playable Decepticon. His voice is now a similar Vocoder fashion of his G1 counterpart. In Dark of the Moon, Soundwave is a playable character. He is ordered by Megatron to destroy a Sector 7 nest base that contains information about Sentinel Prime. Soundwave is among the Decepticons that greet Shockwave at the end of the game in South Africa. He shows Shockwave a 3D hologram of Chernobly and the artifact he must recover. He transforms into a Modified white SUV similar to a Cadillac SRX In the Nintendo DS game Revenge of the Fallen: Decepticons, Grindor, Sideways, Soundwave and Starscream greet a new Decepticon protoform and send him on a mission. Soundwave directs the new protoform to survive on Earth. In the downloadable content pack for the Xbox 360 and PS3, Soundwave is confirmed to be a playable character. He is probably based on the Deluxe toy. In Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Stealth Force Edition for the Wii and 3DS Soundwave is a playable character, and (like with the PS3/360 version) transforms into a heavily modified Cadillac SRX In Transformers: War for Cybertron, Soundwave is a playable character taking the alternate form of a cybertronian truck. He is playable in levels 3, 4 and 5 of the decepticon campaign and is a boss that players have to fight in the autobot level 2. Like all characters within the game he is playable in escalation mode, and players have to have their decepticon leader look like him in multiplayer mode. In the game his default weapon is a neutron assault rifle, although he does have an energon repair ray in level 5 of the decepticon campaign. =Toys= * Revenge of the Fallen Deluxe Soundwave (2009) :A Triple Changer that transforms from Cybertronian battleship to satellite and robot. :The toy stands 12.5 centimeters tall in robot mode. * Revenge of the Fallen Deluxe Soundwave G1 redeco (2009) :A redeco of Soundwave in blue and gray, resembling his G1 colors.

Transformers Animated Soundwave appears in Transformers Animated as a modular music-based Decepticon, who specializes in sonic interference. Whilst his robot mode still retains elements of his original tapedeck incarnation, more so in his toy form, his alt-mode is now a loudspeaker-equipped Scion xB. He also possesses two supporters: Laserbeak, who transforms into an electric guitar he uses for a sonic boom attack, and Ratbat, which becomes a keytar for use in sonic hypnosis. His voice, now provided by Jeff Bennett in the United States and Nobuo Tobita in Japan, once again requires a vocoder to create Soundwave's trademark robotic monotone voice. =Animated series= Soundwave was originally a simple robotic toy that Sari got for her birthday, built by Megatron as a part of a plan to take advantage of Sari's careless and repeated use of her Allspark key to continuously upgrade the toy until it serves as a suitable body for Megatron to host. However, the excessive usage of the key to enhance Soundwave caused an unexpected side-effect: Developing almost Cybertronian sophistication at an alarmingly increasing rate to the point of becoming self-aware to the point where he refuses to take orders from Sari (or any other human) any more. It was by observing the common labor-robots in the city that he concluded that not only robots are superior to humans in every way, but that it's illogical that robots are forced to succumb to their human masters, and it should be the other way around. By then, Megatron introduced himself to Soundwave through televisions in a nearby electronics store as his creator \\"of sorts\\" to impose unto him his plan to crush the Autobots. At first, Soundwave declared this illogical to fight robot-kind until Megatron insisted that they were traitors that upheld the human race's slavery of all robot-kind, convincing Soundwave to ultimately side with the Decepticons with the intent to overthrow all humans and obliterate the robots that protect them. He used his technology-manipulating speakers to summon all nearby labor- robots to convert them into his new Transformer body while using his stereo- system to spark a robot-revolution against their \\"human-oppressors.\\" All automated forms of public transportation stopped and the city's labor robots jumped the Autobots when they appeared on the scene. After failing to convince Bulkhead into joining him and killing Sari in the name of all robot-kind, it appeared that Bulkhead destroyed Soundwave with a single blow of his powerful wrecking-ball arm, shattering his body into hundreds of pieces. However, unknown to the Autobot, his core survived, in the form of a small, almost- invisible media player. Soundwave regenerated at Christmas time as ex-Sumdac Systems Vice President Porter C. Powell, who had acquired Soundwave's original patents while he was in charge of the company, was distributing multiple Soundwave toys during the Christmas season. Soundwave managed to reprogram some of the toys, using one of them to spike the Autobots' oil nog. With the Autobots now sedated and out of commission, Soundwave proceeded to take them to the basement where he attempted to brainwash them into taking on his ideology as Decepticons by placing them in a virtual program in human form. However, the plan was briefly halted by the attempted intervention of Sari as well as the Autobots learning the truth of where they are. Soundwave had a backup plan, using Laserbeak to force Sari into a retreat, then using Ratbat in keytar mode to complete the Autobots' reformat. Soundwave succeeded in placing the Autobots under his control, and used the numerous toy replicas of himself to take control of the humans in Detroit. However, since Sari was techno-organic, she was immune to the mind-control waves. Soundwave was defeated when Sari recruited the help of Scrapper, Snarl and Wreck-Gar to fight the brainwashed Autobots, and was smashed apart along with Ratbat by Optimus using Laserbeak's guitar mode as a makeshift axe. Though Soundwave's core still remained intact, it was eventually turned off by Sari before being rescued by Laserbeak. It is unknown what became of Soundwave after that. =Toys= * Animated Deluxe Soundwave with Laserbeak (2008) :A Deluxe sized figure that transforms into a Scion xB-like vehicle. Soundwave's bio describes his alternate mode as an SUV, although the Scion xB is actually a station wagon that resembles a small minivan. Its most notable feature is that one of his \\"minions\\", Laserbeak, is present in the form of a Flying V-style electric guitar that transforms into a bird. It can also be attached to the top of his vehicle mode or held like a guitar in robot mode.

His appearance is based on the white music label Soundwave MP3 player, while Buzzsaw seems to be based on Steeljaw in appearance. =Fun Publications= Soundwave first appears as a member of Megatron's forces in the Transformers: Timelines story \\"Shattered Glass\\" story by Fun Publications. He helps in the attack on the Autobot's Ark launching platform, working with Buzzsaw. Soundwave makes a cameo in the fiction \\"Dungeons & Dinobots\\", a text based story. When the Autobots are gaining the advantage in an attack on the Arch-Ayr fuel dump he calls in the Mayhem Suppression Squad to help the Decepticons. Soundwave appears in the story \\"Do Over\\". He is among the crew of the Nemesis, which follows the Autobot's Ark to Earth. When the ship is damaged in battle with the Ark he escapes in a stasis pod to Earth. Soundwave is spotlighted in the story The Desert Heat!. In this story, having crashed to Earth in an escape pod, Heatwave recovers Soundwave and helps his fellow Decepticon get back online and assume an Earth-style alternate mode.http://www.transformersclub.com/_images/DHpage1.jpg Soundwave appears in the story Eye in the Sky. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to Burpleson Air Force Base to stop the Autobots from controlling the GODS defense system. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control. Soundwave is spotlighted in the story Blitzwing Bop. The Elite Guardsman Thunderwing intercepts a radio signal from Earth which mentions Soundwave. Finding Soundwave is wanted for a minor offense from long ago he heads to Earth. Thunderwing finds Soundwave involved in a battle the Autobot Blaster for the possession of the malfunctioning Decepticon Blitzwing. Although not interested in the dispute, Soundwave convinces Thunderwing that Soundwave cannot leave Earth for trial on Cybertron until his commanding officer can be notified, and the only way to get Starscream online is to rescue Blitzwing. Thunderwing is still unwilling to takes sides in the battle against Blaster, merely following the Decepticon, but Soundwave tricks Blaster into mentioning a crime he committed on Cybertron while Thunderwing is in nearby. Thunderwing immediately goes into arrest mode and tries to capture Blaster, but Blaster escapes in a malfunctioning Stellar Spanner. With Starscream back online Soundwave confesses to his minor crimes and Thunderwing passes a sentence of community service on him. =Toys= An official toy exists, as part of the SG Blaster Vs SG Soundwave box-set, and is a repaint of the G1 Soundblaster toy (itself, a retool of the G1 Soundwave toy). In addition, the white Music Label Soundwave figure matches his colors almost exactly, save for the Decepticon symbol on his chest, and has been officially repurposed as one of this character's forms. * Timelines Deluxe Shattered Glass Soundwave (2012) :A BotCon 2012 exclusive white and blue redeco of the Universe/Classics 2.0 Deluxe Ironhide/Ratchet figure with a new head sculpt.

Joe episode of the same name.BotCon.com - 2012 Box Set Previews: Soundwave Transformers Aligned Continuity Soundwave was a gladiator around the same time as Megatron. He has many pet Mini-Cons who work for him, particularly Laserbeak. Soundwave is one of the main group of Decepticons in the 2011 computer animated series Transformers: Prime.TFW2005.com - BotCon 2010 Transformers: Prime Panel Coverage Unlike his previous incarnations, Soundwave chooses not to speak with his own voice, but instead records archive audio and video from other sources and repeats it when needed, displaying it on his face, which is composed entirely of an electronic screen. The fact that Soundwave does not speak by choice is indicated in an interview with producer Jeff Kline. He is armed with two cables that extend from his chest that have an electrical appendage on each end that have a variety of uses, and he has integrated ground bridge/space bridge controls. He is rarely seen in combat, spending most of his time supporting the Decepticons as communications officer and technical specialist, but has shown himself to be a very proficient fighter when circumstances demand it, displaying not only extraordinary fighting skills, but also the expert use of Laserbeak, his electric cables, and even his ground bridge/space bridge controls as effective weapons against his enemies. When Soundwave speaks in Prime, he sounds like his G1 counterpart, only with his voice distortion slightly less enhanced, thus sounding more human than robotic. In Robots in Disguise they return to using the same voice distortion they used in the G1 show. Frank Welker reprises his role as Soundwave in this continuity. =Prime series= In the Darkness Rising 5 part mini-series, Soundwave detects the presence of Arcee, so Starscream sends a pair of Decepticons to attack her. Later, Soundwave detects a signal from deep space, which he is certain is Megatron, so the Space Bridge is opened, and Megatron returns. Later, Soundwave deploys Laserbeak at Starscream's orders to capture Fowler in order to locate the Autobot base. He is later assigned to highjack an Earth bond radio telescope array to location of Cybertron, as part Megatron's plan to use their Space Bridge to transport Dark Energon to Cybertron. However the Autobot's young human allies figure out the Decepticons have highjacked the array and go to the array to shut it down. The young computer wiz Raf hacks into the array computer system, and Soundwave attacks them. He cuts the array's main line locking the dishes in place. While preparing to leave, the Autobots human ally Miko takes a picture of Soundwave with her cell phone, Soundwave responds to this by taking a picture of Jack, Miko, and Raf (possibly with the intention of passing it along with information of their connection with the Autobots onto his fellow Decepticons). Soundwave is well aware of Starscream's treachery against Megatron, and on several occasions saved Megatron from his treacherous lieutenant. In \\"Masters & Students\\", Soundwave sent Laserbeak to make sure that Starscream retrieved the incapacitated Megatron from the Space Bridge wreckage while he witnesses Optimus' battle with Skyquake. In \\"Sick Mind\\" when Starscream and Knock Out conspire to euthanize the comatose Megatron, Soundwave at first appears to consider agreeing with the two, but points out the cord of Bumblebee's cortical psychic patch Bumblebee is hooked up to, and orders Megatron be put back online so that he will not have fallen by an Autobot's hand. In \\"Rock Bottom\\" Megatron reveals he is aware of Starscream's ongoing treachery due to Soundwave having constant surveillance on the traitor and relaying his attempts of usurping him. In \\"One Shall Rise\\" Pt. 3, Airachnid is placed in temporary command of the Decepticons when Megatron leaves to aid Optimus in defeating Unicron. In an attempt to secure her power for good, and to escape Unicron's wrath, Airachnid suggests that the Decepticons leave Megatron to continue their efforts on another world. Soundwave, being eternally loyal to Megatron, vetoed her orders and displayed unexpected combat skills to secure the ship for when Megatron returned. It is implied that, although Megatron is made aware of Airachnid's attempted grab for power, he does not punish her until Soundwave reminds him of her treachery in the season 2 episode \\"Crossfire\\". In \\"Orion Pax\\" Pt. 1, Megatron orders Soundwave to remove Arcee from the ship after she broke in to try to rescue Optimus Prime. Soundwave manages to open a ground bridge to bridge her off, right before Orion saw her. In \\"Triage\\", Soundwave hunts for an ancient Cybertronian relic. Having lost his minion Laserbeak, he continues the search on his own, fighting Wheeljack to claim the relic, the Resonance Blaster and defeat Wheeljack before he reclaims Laserbeak. He returns to the Nemesis with Megatron's prize, and is highly praised for it by Megatron, putting Knock Out and Dreadwing to shame who lost their relics to Arcee, Bumblebee and Starscream. In \\"Hard Knocks\\", Soundwave captured Smokescreen and brought him on board the Nemesis after the Decepticons learned that Smokescreen was a clue to finding the final Omega Key. In \\"Regeneration\\" and \\"Darkest Hour\\", Soundwave, along with Starscream and Knock Out, captured the children and held them for ransom unless the Autobots gave the Omega Keys to the Decepticons. However, when Optimus Prime destroyed the Omega Lock (and the Keys with them), Soundwave retreated back to the Nemesis with the other Decepticons. In \\"Darkmount, NV\\", when Jack and Arcee were spotted in Jasper following the destruction of the Autobot base, Soundwave sent Laserbeak, along with two Vehicons, to terminate them. However, after Laserbeak was destroyed, Soundwave was unable to retrieve any surveillance footage from his remains. In \\"Scattered\\" and \\"Prey\\", Soundwave was present when Shockwave presented Predaking to Megatron. In \\"Rebellion\\", when Starscream sent out members of his armada to investigate a number of Autobot signals, Soundwave pointed out to him that their army was thinly spread and suggested that the Autobots were using the Harbinger as a base of operations. He later retreated with the other Decepticons as Darkmount was destroyed by Optimus Prime, aided by Agent Fowler and several Air Force pilots. In \\"Thirst\\", he oversees the destruction of the mutant Terrorcons and is confronted by a newly freed Airachnid and her army of minions. When she charges him he opens a space bridge to one of Cybertron's moons stranding her and her minions. In \\"Minus One\\", Soundwave is taken captive by the Autobots and questioned for information regarding Megatron's motives. However, Soundwave erases all the data of Megatron's plans before Optimus gives Ratchet approval to crack him open. The normally mute Decepticon then taunts the Autobots in his own voice before deactivating. Later, Laserbeak attacks the Autobot base and hooks up with Soundwave, reactivating him and giving him a new copy of Megatron's plans. He then proceeds to incapacitate Bulkhead and Smokescreen before kidnapping Ratchet and bringing him to the Nemesis. In \\"Deadlock\\", Soundwave fights Jack and Miko (who is in the Apex armor) on the bridge of the Nemesis. With help from Raf, Jack and Miko trap Soundwave in the Shadowzone. =Robots in Disguise (2015)= Soundwave returns from the Shadowzone in the tenth episode of the second season of the sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise. He escapes, trapping Bumblebee in the Shadowzone. Then, he quickly immobilizes most of the Autobots before getting tricked by Fixit and the humans into letting Bumblebee back in. The Autobots corner Soundwave and throw him back into the Shadowzone. However, he returns in the final season, as a major antagonist with a new body. In \\"Collateral Damage\\", he tries to return Megatron from his exile but his plan failed when he was defeated by Bumblebee and his team along with Optimus Prime who was upgraded with Hi-Test. =Books= Soundwave appears in the novel Transformers: Exodus. He was one of Megatronus's opponents and nearly defeated him, however this instead brought respect between the two. Soundwave commanded the Mini-Cons Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy, and Laserbeak, and joined Megatron as one of the Decepticons. Soundwave appears in the short story \\"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\\" by Alex Irvine.MTV.com - Learn How Bumblebee Lost His Voice in This Short Story from Exodus Author Alex Irvine Soundwave appears in the novels Transformers: Exiles and Transformers: Retribution. =Video games= Soundwave appears in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron as a playable character in the last three chapters of the Decepticon campaign. While Shockwave is established as Megatron's second-in- command, Soundwave is shown acting as Megatron's right hand during the campaign in Shockwave's absence. Soundwave assists Megatron and Breakdown into infiltrating Iacon, defeating Zeta Prime, and hunting down Omega Supreme. He is also a boss in the Autobot campaign, being the warden of Kaon Prison in the Decepticons' capital city and using his tape cassettes Frenzy, Rumble and Laserbeak to attack. The Autobots manage to defeat him, but not before he delivers a fatal blow to Zeta Prime, absorbing what remained of his life force energy in order to regenerate his own strength, and then manages to escape before Optimus can finish him. Aside from transforming into a Cybertronian truck, Soundwave can also turn into a boombox, as shown right before his boss battle, in the game's ending credits and a GameStop promotional commercial for the game featuring Shockwave.GameSpot Video Transformers War for Cybertron Storyline Movie2.flv - YouTube In this mode, he plays the Stan Bush songs \\"The Touch\\" and \\"Till All Are One\\". In the sequel game Transformers: Fall of Cybertron; Soundwave is playable in two levels. The first time is in Chapter 9 in which he rebuilds Megatron after he was destroyed by Metroplex. The other level is the final one in which Soundwave boards the Ark and helps destroy the Ark's defenses. Rumble and Laserbeak assist Soundwave in these tasks. He pops up throughout the rest of the game as an NPC. =Toys= * Generations Deluxe Cybertronian Soundwave (2010) :A new mold, based on his appearance on War for Cybertron.TFW2005.com - Official Images of Generations Blurr and Dirge * United UN05 Deluxe Soundwave Cybertron Mode (2010) :The Japanese version of the Generations figure by Takara Tomy is in a metallic repaint. * Prime Cyberverse Legion Soundwave (2012) * Prime Robots in Disguise Revealers Deluxe Soundwave with Laserbeak (2012) :A new Deluxe mold of Soundwave, which transforms into a UAV.

It is operated as a 5-star luxury hotel with a golf course, with its restaurant, the Earl of Thomond, being awarded a Michelin star in 1995, under head chef Jean Baptiste Molinari. The present building was completed in 1835. However, the first building constructed here seems to have been a tower house built in the 15th or early 16th century and is recorded as being erected by Thomas, the son of Shane Mac Anerheny.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/osl/thomond_castles1.htm There were at least three houses on the site, at various times, called Dromoland. While Dromoland later became residence of eight generations of the O'Brien family, early records suggest that the area was also occupied by other local Gaelic families, such as the McInerney family during the 16th century.http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap16_bishop_of_killaloe.htm According to the historian James Frost, Dromoland translates as the \\"Hill of Litigation\\".Dromoland Castle  History  In 1551 Dromoland was listed in the will of Murrough O'Brien. He was first Tanist and in 1543 had been granted the title of first Earl of Thomond by Henry VIII. Murrough bequeathed Leamaneh Castle to his third son Donough MacMurrough O'Brien, and also gave him the castle and lands at Dromoland. In 1582 Donough was hanged in Limerick on charges of rebellion and the government decided that all his property would be forfeited to the Crown. Accordingly, Sir George Cusack, the sheriff, took possession of Dromoland. Some years later, Turlough O'Brien killed Cusack and various O'Briens attempted to re-possess Dromoland. The fourth Earl of Thomond claimed to have sole ownership and tried to exclude Donough's son, Conor MacDonough O'Brien. The outcome of this dispute is unclear. Dromoland Castle, from, A series of picturesque views of seats of the noblemen and gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland (1840) In 1604 when Conor O'Brien died he left Dromoland to his son, Donough MacConor O'Brien. Donough, whose mother was Slany O'Brien, was then only about eight years old. A legal battle ensued between the fourth Earl and Slany O'Brien. The dispute was settled by arbitration in 1613. The Earl, by now Lord Thomond, became owner of Dromoland on payment of 132.13.4 pounds in compensation to Slany O'Brien. When Donough was older, he refused to abide by the settlement. By 1614 a William Starkey was leasing Dromoland from Lord Thomond. By 1628 Lord Thomond was dead and Donough continued the dispute through the Court of Wards and Liveries in Dublin. In 1629 Donough was granted entry \\"on all the manors, lands and tenements of his late father\\" on payment of a fine. Dromoland was however not listed among the many properties named, and it rested with the Earls of Thomond for another fifty years. The fifth Earl did transfer two other properties to Donough as compensation. Robert Starkey, son of William, was in residence at Dromoland when the rebellion of 1641 began. It seems that he either fled the area or sublet the property. In 1642 Col. Conor O'Brien of Leamaneh, son of Donough and husband of Maire Rua, seized the castle along with a Captain McInerhenny, the leader of the Irish force, who surprised the guards through help of Starkey's assistant Moran. Conor was killed in battle in 1651. His eldest son Donough O'Brien, born to Conor and M√°ire Rua O'Brien in 1642, was heir to Leamaneh Castle and to the family claim on Dromoland. In addition, Donough inherited large landholdings from his half-brother, William O'Neylan (O'Neillan) (1635‚Äì78) of Dysert O'Dea Castle, to whose father Daniel M√°ire Rua had been married from 1634 until his death in 1639. Robert Starkey resumed the lease and in 1666 Dromoland was sub-leased to Colonel Daniel O'Brien from Carrigaholt Castle. Three years later, it was assigned to Thomas Walcott of Moyhill. Finally, in 1684 the freehold was assigned to Donough O'Brien. At this time Dromoland was a modest house. The original tower house seems to have been added onto during Starkey's time, before Donough moved in from Leamaneh. Gazebo on Turret Hill Sir Donough O'Brien, 1st Baronet, died in 1717. During his time at Dromoland, it was described as \\"a handsome Grecian Building.\\" Donough's son Lucius also died in 1717 so Edward, son of Lucius, became 2nd Baronet. This first Sir Edward O'Brien decorated the house with pictures and carvings. He also had designs drawn up for a new house. Thomas Roberts and John Aheron both submitted drawings to him for a house and garden at Dromoland. John Aheron appears to have been the architect responsible for the final design. He also designed the Gazebo on Turret Hill, across the road from the main entrance gateway. It was probably built for observing the training of horses. Dromoland was expanded to a ten-bay, -storey house. A two- story quadrangle was completed in 1736. Edward died in 1765. In 1795 an issue of the Gentleman's Magazine gave the following description of Dromoland: > \\"the noble and beautiful seat of Sir Lucius O'Brien, Bart., in the county of > Clare, situated on a hill gently rising from a lake of twenty four acres in > the middle of woods. Three beautiful hills rise above it, commanding fine > prospects of the great rivers Fergus and Shannon at their junction, being > each of them a league wide.\\" Sir Lucius O'Brien was the eldest son of the first Sir Edward and was the 3rd Baronet. He died in 1794. His son, the second Sir Edward, was the 4th Baronet, and decided to rebuild the castle. In 1821, it was the birthplace of Edward's brother Robert's son, George O'Brien. Work began around 1822 and cost about –à50,000 to complete. The Pain brothers submitted some classical designs but Edward O'Brien chose their neo-gothic designs, influenced by John Nash. James and George Richard Pain had been pupils of Nash in England. The building was completed in 1835. Samuel Lewis writing in 1837 described Dromoland as: > \\"a superb edifice in the castellated style, lately erected on the site of > the ancient mansion, and surrounded by an extensive and richly wooded > demesne, in which great improvements have recently been made\\". Edward was married to Charlotte Smith and her inherited wealth was probably essential in covering construction costs of their new mansion. Edward and Charlotte were parents of William Smith O'Brien, the leader of the Young Irelander rebellion of 1848. Sir Edward died in 1837. His eldest son Lucius was 5th Baronet and 13th Baron Inchiquin. Castellated turret. Burke's Visitation of Seats (1855) gives the following description of Dromoland: > \\"It is built entirely of dark blue limestone, and in fine chiseled > workmanship; the ornamental grounds and woods extend over more than 1,500 > [6.1 km2] of land‚Ä¶from some of the eminences there are views of the Shannon > and Fergus, which, at this part of the country, resembles a large inland > lake with island, making Dromoland one of the most beautiful and desirable > residences in Ireland.\\" =Modern form= Dromoland has been preserved with little change since the mid-19th century. The mansion is in \\"baronial\\" or \\"Gothic Revival\\" style. It has four linked irregular castellated turrets. A gothic porch to the north front displays the O'Brien arms. The western portion faces out to the lake, and the east towards the hill where Thomond House now stands. The large walled gardens are to the south. In 1902 the 15th Baron Inchiquin, Lucius, took the old 17th century gateway from Leamaneh and erected it at the entrance to the large walled garden. A long curving drive leads from the gateway and classical lodge, passing north of the lake and round to the front door of the castle. In 1962, Donough O'Brien, the sixteenth Baron Inchiquin, sold Dromoland Castle and because of difficult financial circumstances. He built Thomond House on a hill overlooking Dromoland. He moved into this Georgian style house in 1965 and died in 1968. The house is now occupied by the 18th Baron Inchiquin. =Hotel= Dromoland Castle was bought by United States citizen Bernard P. McDonough in 1962. It has since then been converted for use as a top-grade luxurious hotel. Dromoland Castle Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels Worldwide. Famous guests George W. Bush, Bertie Ahern, and Romano Prodi at their joint press conference at the Castle in 2004. United States President George W.

Although the site dates back to 922 when the Vikings lived on the Island, the castle itself was built on the orders of King John in 1200. One of the best preserved Norman castles in Europe, the walls, towers and fortifications remain today and are visitor attractions. The remains of a Viking settlement were uncovered during archaeological excavations at the site in 1900. Before the Castle The Viking sea-king, Tomrair mac Ailchi, built the first permanent Viking stronghold on Inis Sibhtonn (King's Island) in 922. He used the base to raid the length of the River Shannon from Lough Derg to Lough Ree, pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. In 937 the Limerick Vikings clashed with those of Dublin on Lough Ree and were defeated. In 943 they were defeated again when the chief of the local Dalcassian clan joined with Ceallach√°n, king of Munster and the Limerick Vikings were forced to pay tribute to the clans. The power of the Vikings never recovered, and they were reduced to the level of a minor clan, however often playing pivotal parts in the endless power struggles of the next few centuries. Early history The arrival of the Anglo-Normans to the area in 1172 changed everything. Domhnall M√≥r √ì Briain burned the city to the ground in 1174 in a bid to keep it from the hands of the new invaders. After he died in 1194, the Anglo-Normans finally captured the area in 1195 under John, Lord of Ireland. In 1197, Limerick was given its first charter and its first Mayor, Adam Sarvant. A castle, built on the orders of King John and bearing his name, was completed around 1210. The castle was built on the boundary of the River Shannon in order to protect the city from the Gaelic kingdoms to the west and from any rebellion by Norman lords to the east and south. Under the general peace imposed by the Norman rule, Limerick prospered as both a port and a trading centre, partly due to the castle acting as a watchdog on any cargo passing through the port of Limerick. By this time the city was divided into an area became known as \\"English Town\\" on King's Island, while another settlement, named \\"Irish Town\\" had grown on the south bank of the river. The town of Limerick became so wealthy during this era King John set up a mint in the North West corner of the castle, with pennies and half pennies from this time available to see in Limerick museum today. A 1574 document prepared for the Spanish ambassador attests to its wealth: Luke Gernon, an English-born judge and resident of Limerick, wrote an equally flattering account of the city in 1620: Siege of Limerick The walls of the castle were severely damaged in the 1642 Siege of Limerick, the first of five sieges of the city in the 17th century. In 1642, the castle was occupied by Protestants fleeing the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and was besieged by an Irish Confederate force under Garret Barry. Barry had no siege artillery so he undermined the walls of King John's Castle by digging away their foundations. Those inside surrendered just before Barry collapsed the walls. However, such was the damage done to the wall's foundations that a section of them had to be pulled down afterward. 300px 2013 Redevelopment Between 2011 and 2013, the castle underwent a massive redevelopment, with ‚Ç¨5.7 million spent to improve the visitor facilities of the castle. Among the improvements were a brand new visitor centre, interactive exhibitions with computer generated animations, and a cafe with views onto the courtyard and the river.

He attended City College in New York where he graduated in 1951. He continued to the University of Wisconsin where he received a Master's degree and a PhD in the History of Science and Medieval History in 1957. During this time, Grant spent a year at the University of Utrecht as a Fulbright Scholar from 1955-1956. Grant began his successful teaching career while a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin. He was an assistant to a well-known scholar in the field Marshall Clagett, whom he would continue to respect and correspond with throughout his career. Grant taught at the University of Maine and in the history of science program at Harvard University. In 1959, Grant came to Indiana University as an Assistant Professor of History. His teaching career spanned over thirty years at IU. He was instrumental in starting the department later to be known as History and Philosophy of Science.

He emphasized how the roots of modern science were planted in the ancient and medieval worlds long before the modern period, and that the Christian Latin civilization of Western Europe began the last stage of its intellectual development. One basic factor was how Christianity developed in the West with the establishment of the medieval universities around 1200. In God and Reason in the Middle Ages he argued that the Middle Ages had acquired an undeserved reputation as an age of superstition, barbarism, and unreason.https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521003377/bedeslibrary Selected publications Edward Grant published more than ninety articles and twelve books, including: * Physical Science in the Middle Ages (1971) * Much Ado About Nothing: Theories of Space and Vacuum from the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution (1981) * Planets, Stars, & Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200‚Äì1687 (1994) * The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages (1996) * God and Reason in the Middle Ages (2001) * Science and Religion, 400 B.C. to A.D. 1550: From Aristotle to Copernicus (2004) * A History of Natural Philosophy from the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century (2007) References External links * Harvard University Press *Edward Grant papers, 1950-2001 at the Indiana University Archives.

It directly maps to a kernel call of the same name. \`nice\` is used to invoke a utility or shell script with a particular CPU priority, thus giving the process more or less CPU time than other processes. A niceness of -20 is the highest priority and 19 is the lowest priority. The default niceness for processes is inherited from its parent process and is usually 0. Use and effect \`nice\` becomes useful when several processes are demanding more resources than the CPU can provide. In this state, a higher-priority process will get a larger chunk of the CPU time than a lower-priority process. Only the superuser (root) may set the niceness to a lower value (i.e. a higher priority). On Linux it is possible to change \`/etc/security/limits.conf\` to allow other users or groups to set low nice values. If a user wanted to compress a large file, but not slow down other processes, they might run the following: $ nice -n 19 tar cvzf archive.tgz largefile The exact mathematical effect of setting a particular niceness value for a process depends on the details of how the scheduler is designed on that implementation of Unix. A particular operating system's scheduler will also have various heuristics built into it (e.g. to favor processes that are mostly I/O-bound over processes that are CPU-bound). As a simple example, when two otherwise identical CPU-bound processes are running simultaneously on a single-CPU Linux system, each one's share of the CPU time will be proportional to 20 ‚àí p, where p is the process' priority. Thus a process, run with \`nice +15\`, will receive 25% of the CPU time allocated to a normal-priority process: (20 ‚àí 15)/(20 ‚àí 0) = 0.25. On the BSD 4.x scheduler, on the other hand, the ratio in the same example is about ten to one. Similar commands The related \`renice\` program can be used to change the priority of a process that is already running. Linux also has an \`ionice\` program, which affects scheduling of I/O rather than CPU time. Etymology The name \\"nice\\" comes from the fact that the program's purpose is to modify a process niceness value. The true priority, used to decide how much CPU time to concede to each process, is calculated by the kernel process scheduler from a combination of the different processes' niceness values and other data, such as the amount of I/O done by each process. The name \\"niceness\\" originates from the idea that a process with a higher niceness value is \\"nicer\\" to other processes in the system: > This is why the nice number is usually called niceness: a job with a high > niceness is very kind to the users of your system (i.e., it runs at low > priority), while a job with little niceness utilises more of the CPU. The > term \\"niceness\\" could be considered awkward. Unfortunately, it's the only > term that is both accurate (nice numbers are used to compute the priorities > but are not the priorities themselves) and avoids horrible circumlocutions > (\\"increasing the priority means lowering the priority...\\").Jerry Peek, > Shelley Powers, Tim O'Reilly and Mike Loukides (2007).

Leviathan of Parsonstown. The Irish low-frequency array radio telescope in the castle grounds. Birr Castle (Irish: Caisle√°n Bhiorra) is a large castle in the town of Birr in County Offaly, Ireland. It is the home of the 7th Earl of Rosse and his family, and as such the residential areas of the castle are not open to the public, though the grounds and gardens of the demesne are publicly accessible, and include a science museum and a caf√©, a reflecting telescope which was the largest in the world for decades and a modern radio telescope. History There has been a castle on the site since 1170, and from the 14th to the 17th century the O'Carroll family ruled from here over an area known as \\"Ely O'Carroll\\". After the death of Sir Charles O'Carroll, Sir Laurence Parsons (died 1628) was granted Birr Castle and of land in 1620. cites: Parsons engaged English masons in the construction of a new castle on the site. This construction took place, not on the site of the O'Carroll's Black Tower (since disappeared), but at its gatehouse. \\"Flankers\\" were added to the gatehouse diagonally at either side, giving the castle the plan it retains today. After the death of Sir Laurence Parsons and of his elder son Richard, the castle passed to his younger son William. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641 William was besieged at Birr for fifteen months by Catholic forces. After the civil war, William's son Laurence (baronet from 1677) refurbished the castle. A later descendant, Laurence Parsons, 2nd Earl of Rosse, also engaged in some re-building, and heightened and \\"Gothicised\\" the castle in the early 19th century. In turn, his son, the 3rd Earl of Rosse, was responsible for the construction of the great telescope at Birr. When completed in 1845, it was the largest telescope on earth, and capable of capturing more light and seeing further into space than any telescope had done before. Birr therefore became a focus for astronomical observations, and visitors came to visit the observatory from all over the world - including Charles Babbage and H.I.H. Napol√©on Eug√®ne, Prince Imperial. When the 3rd Earl died, his sons carried on the scientific tradition, and Lawrence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse is noted for measuring the heat of the moon. After his death in 1908, however, the telescope fell into disrepair; the mirror was taken to the Science Museum in London, and, circa 1914, the telescope's metal supporting structure was melted down to be used in the First World War. In 1925 the wooden structures around the walls were demolished for safety reasons. Following several intermediate restoration attempts, the telescope was restored more completely in the late 1990s.Detail on telescope reconstruction The demesne =Situation= The demesne runs south and southeast of the town centre. The main public entrance is through a courtyard; there is no direct public access to the castle, which faces into the demesnse. This courtyard contains the Science Centre, caf√©, shop and garden entrance, while the family have an ornamental private gateway, with an adjoining gate lodge, occupied by a staff member, just to the north. Birr's main river, the River Camcor, enters the demesne near the castle, and continues through a pond to flow into the Little Brosna, which in turn marks the border between Counties Offaly and Tipperary, and flows on to the Shannon. The demesne is open to the public for a fee, with an annual subscription available for Friends of Birr Castle Demesne. =Ireland's Historic Science Centre= The castle grounds are also home to Ireland's Historic Science Centre, a museum of Ireland's historic scientists and their contributions to astronomy and botany. The museum lies within a courtyard off William Street. Laurence Parsons, 4th Earl of Rosse and his mother, Mary Parsons, Countess of Rosse, were eminent photographers, and her darkroom, which is also on show within the museum, is believed to be the oldest surviving example in the world. =Caf√© and shop= In the same courtyard as the Science Centre are the Castle Courtyard Caf√© and a small shop. =Parklands and gardens= The grounds of the castle contain the oldest wrought-iron bridge in Ireland, dating from 1820.The Rough Guide to Ireland, 9th Edition; p 219 There was also an early hydroelectric station by the bridge and castle. The walled gardens in the grounds feature Box Hedges that are over 300 years old. They are also, according to The Guinness Book of Records, the tallest hedge in the world. The Irish entry to the 2014 European Tree of the Year contest was the Birr Castle Grey Poplar (Populus x canescens). On 12 February 2014, while voting was still open, it was blown down in a storm.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and- property/gardens/storm-casualties-ireland-s-lost-trees-1.1706766 The grounds also contain a plantation of sequoia redwoods from California, Giants' Grove, which are available for sponsorship. =The \\"Great Telescope\\" - The Leviathan= Dr. Patrick Moore signing his book \\"The Astronomy of Birr Castle\\" at NIHE - 1985 A major feature on the grounds of the castle is the \\"Great Telescope\\" or Leviathan of Parsonstown or The Rosse Telescope) of the third Earl of Rosse, an astronomical telescope with a 183-cm (72 in) reflector. It was completed in 1845 and was used for several decades before the last observations were made in the first years of the 20th century. Its record size was not surpassed until the completion of the 100-inch (2.5-meter) Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1917. It was dismantled in 1914, but the structure was restored and the telescope reconstructed in the 1990s and is visitable by the public, with occasional demonstrations of its movement, and talks. =Modern radio-telescopy= The demesne hosts two radio-telescopy projects in the Mount Palmer division near the Little Brosna and the County Tipperary border. Astrophysicist Peter T. Gallagher of Trinity College Dublin met Lord Rosse in 2010 while visiting the Demesne in search of suitable quiet sites for radio-telescopy projects, and they agreed to repurpose an old sheep yard. The agreement led to the establishment of the Rosse Solar-Terrestrial Observatory, a Trinity College Dublin project, which was formally opened and blessed on June 28 2014, though already fully functional, with antennae picking up solar activity, even in cloudy weather. The sheep pen building was converted into a control room, and a magnetometer, jointly operated between TCD and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, was also installed. Already by 2014, a major solar burst was detected by the Birr system, and reported in Nature Physics. In the meantime the project team started work on establishing the I-LOFAR radio-telescope station (IE613), a node in a Europe-spanning network, which was largely built in 2016, and was switched on at Birr in 2017. Constructed in fields in the Mount Palmer area, between the Rivers Camcor and Little Brosna, it comprises around 3,000 antennae and 55 km of cabling, and eircom installed upgraded fibre to enable massive data carriage for it. This is the westernmost station in the LOFAR network. The I-LOFAR telescope, in 2018, observed for the first time a billion-year-old red-dwarf, flare star called CN Leo, almost 75 trillion kilometres away.Birr radio telescope catches flaring red dwarf 75 trillion kilometres away Irish Times, 2018-03-27. There is a viewing point provided for visitors to the demesne to overlook the telescope structure.

For their time they were among the most powerful and advanced ships of their type in the world, and set the trend for future British designs. They arrived in time to see service in the First World War. During the interwar period these ships formed the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas until gradually replaced by new construction; by the mid-1930s most had been displaced to the reserve fleet. Most ships survived to make an extensive contribution to the Second World War effort, in the vital role of convoy escort, freeing up more modern ships for fleet action. History (Admiralty V class), showing the typical inter-war layout of a V and W-class destroyer. She is wearing the 1939-pattern funnel bands of the 16th Destroyer Flotilla based at Portsmouth; one red over one white. The V and W class were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design in the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Their lineage can be traced to the River or E class of 1902 that had introduced the classic raised forecastle into the Royal Navy. The of 1905 introduced oil-firing and the resultant economies in size, consumption and crew. The of 1915 had introduced a raised shelter deck forwards, allowing two guns to be carried in the classic superfiring (i.e. one gun fires over the top of the one below and in front of it) \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" positions. The , also of 1915, introduced a three-boiler, two-funnel layout allowing for a more compact hull and giving increased deckspace and the introduced geared turbines giving on two shafts. Design The new design, originally known as the Admiralty V-class leader, incorporated all these improvements, and also a more sensible layout of the main armament, the amidships gun between the funnels being removed to the aft shelter deck, superfiring over the gun on the quarterdeck. This introduced the ubiquitous \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"X\\", \\"Y\\" layout for the main armament. New developments, such as director firing for the main armament, triple torpedo tubes and a heavier armament were introduced either from the outset, or as they became available. Ships with triple tubes became the Admiralty W class and those with their armament upgraded to the BL 4.7 in gun became Admiralty Modified W-class ships. Admiralty V-class leadersThe Admiralty V-class leaders were the initial five V-class ships ordered in April 1916 and were designed and built as flotilla leaders. These ships were necessary as the 36 knot speed of the new S class meant that existing flotilla leaders would no longer be able to keep pace with their charges. To speed construction time, these new vessels were based on the three-boiler, two- funnel machinery of the R class and as they were inevitably larger, a slight decrease in speed was accepted. The fore funnel was tall and narrow and the after one was shorter and wider. They differed from the later Admiralty and the Thornycroft V classes in that they had a larger bridge structure, taller foremast, mainmast mounted further aft to accommodate an enlarged spread of wireless aerials, extra boats abreast the after funnel and the searchlight platform between the torpedo tubes was enlarged to accommodate an extra compass. Vampire trialled triple mounts for her torpedoes and as a result had a total of six tubes. =Ships= * Valentine -- built by Cammell Laird & Company, Birkenhead, laid down 8 August 1916, launched 24 March 1917, completed 27 June 1917, damaged by German aircraft, beached and abandoned off Terneuzen 15 May 1940, salvaged 1953 and broken up. * Valhalla -- built by Cammell Laird, laid down 8 August 1916, launched 22 May 1917, completed 31 July 1917, sold for breaking up 17 December 1931. * Valkyrie -- built by William Denny & Brothers Limited, Dumbarton, laid down 25 May 1916, launched 12 March 1917, completed 16 June 1917, sold for breaking up 24 August 1936. * -- built by Denny, laid down 25 May 1916, launched 5 August 1917, completed 21 August 1917, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947. * Vampire -- built by J.

Admiralty V classThe 23 vessels comprising the Admiralty V class were ordered in July 1916 under the 9th War Programme as repeats of the Admiralty V-class leaders (ordered three months earlier) to counter the threat posed by reports of a new class of powerful German destroyers (see ). They omitted the flotilla leader function and as such differed in detail from the leader predecessor. While all 23 ships were completed with two twin torpedo tubes (Voyager, which was completed with triple tubes, was an Admiralty W-class unit ordered in December 1916), in 1921 all Admiralty V class had their forward bank replaced by a triple bank, for a total of five torpedoes; and from 1923 onwards most ships had their aft bank (twin tubes) replaced by a triple bank, for a total of six torpedoes, except in Vimy, Vanoc, Velox, Versatile and Vortigern in which only the forward bank was replaced. Vanquisher, Vanoc, Velox, Vehement, Venturous, Versatile, Vimiera, Vittoria and Vortigern were built with the ability to be converted into minelayers within 24 hours. For this purpose they would land their torpedo tubes and \\"Y\\" gun on the quarterdeck and have screens fitted to protect the mines, of which up to sixty could be carried. They could be distinguished by the permanent mine chutes at the stern. =Ships= * Vancouver -- built by William Beardmore & Company, Dalmuir, laid down 15 March 1917, launched 28 December 1917, completed 9 March 1918.

Admiralty W classThe Admiralty W class comprised 21 vessels, all ordered in December 1916 under the 10th War Programme, although the two ships ordered from Yarrow were cancelled in April 1917 and replaced by the orders for two Yarrow S class (Tomahawk and Torch). The Admiralty W-class ships were a follow on from the Admiralty V class, with minimal changes, primarily in that the triple torpedo tube mounting was now ready and all these vessels shipped two of these mountings from new. They also had a taller mainmast. =Ships= * Voyager -- built by Alexander Stephen & Sons, Linthouse, laid down 17 May 1917, launched 8 May 1918, completed 24 June 1918, transferred to Royal Australian Navy in October 1933, bombed by Japanese aircraft and beached Timor 23 September 1942. * Wakeful -- built by John Brown & Company, Clydebank, laid down 17 January 1917, launched 6 October 1917, completed 16 November 1917, torpedoed and sunk by German E-boat S30 off Nieuwpoort 29 May 1940. * Walker -- built by William Denny & Brothers Limited, Dumbarton, laid down 26 March 1917, launched 29 November 1917, completed 2 February 1918, sold for breaking up 15 March 1946. * Walpole -- built by William Doxford & Sons Ltd, Pallion, laid down May 1917, launched 12 February 1918, completed 7 August 1918, mined in North Sea 6 January 1945 and written off as constructive total loss, sold for breaking up 8 February 1945. * Walrus -- built by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering Company, Govan, laid down 1917, launched 27 December 1917, completed 8 March 1918, stranded in Scarborough North Bay 12 February 1938 and written off as constructive total loss, sold for breaking up 5 March 1938. * Warwick -- built by Hawthorn Leslie & Company, Hebburn, laid down 10 March 1917, launched 28 December 1917, completed 18 March 1918, torpedoed and sunk by off Trevose Head 20 February 1944. * Watchman -- built by John Brown, laid down 17 January 1917, launched 2 November 1917, completed 26 January 1918, sold for breaking up 23 July 1945. * Waterhen -- built by Palmers Shipbuilding & Iron Company, Jarrow, laid down July 1917, launched 26 March 1918, completed 17 April 1918, transferred to Royal Australian Navy in October 1933, bombed and sunk off of Libya by German and Italian aircraft 30 June 1941. * Wessex -- built by Hawthorn Leslie, laid down 23 May 1917, launched 12 March 1918, completed 11 May 1918, bombed by German aircraft off Calais 24 May 1940. * Westcott -- built by Denny, laid down 30 March 1917, launched 14 February 1918, completed 12 March 1918, sold for breaking up 8 January 1946.

Thornycroft V and W classThe Thornycroft V and W class were two V class and two W class specials built by John I. Thornycroft & Company Limited to Admiralty specifications. They were ordered in pairs six months apart, on 30 July 1916 and 9 December 1916, respectively. They could be recognised by a higher freeboard and shorter mainmast than the Admiralty type and the flat-sided funnels typical of Thornycroft. The large boiler room (two units) was aft with the single unit forward, the fore funnel therefore being narrower. This arrangement was transposed in the Thornycroft Modified W class. The V-class ships had twin torpedo tubes and those of the W-class triple units. The second pair had slightly more displacement and a guaranteed (by contract) speed of 36 knots compared with the 35 knots guaranteed for the first pair. Early in their careers the specified anti-aircraft gun, the QF 2 pounder, was replaced by a single QF 12 pdr 20 cwt Mark I weapon, on a platform between the after funnel and the forward torpedo tubes. All except Viscount, which became a long range escort, were modified to WAIR type fast anti-aircraft escorts. Their conversions were non-standard in that they carried a pair of QF 2 pdr Mark VIII guns on platforms amidships ‚Äì en echelon in Woolston only ‚Äì and that Viceroy retained a bank of torpedoes for some time. =Ships= * Viceroy, built by John I. Thornycroft & Company Limited, Woolston, laid down 15 December 1916, launched 17 November 1917, completed 5 February 1918, sold for breaking up June 1948. * Viscount, built by Thornycroft, laid down 20 December 1916, launched 29 December 1917, completed 25 March 1918, sold for breaking up 20 March 1945 but actually broken up in May 1947. * Wolsey, built by Thornycroft, laid down 28 March 1917, launched 16 March 1918, completed 1 May 1918, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947. * Woolston, built by Thornycroft, laid down 25 April 1917, launched 27 April 1918, completed 28 June 1918, sold for breaking up 18 February 1947. Thornycroft modified W classThe Thornycroft Modified W class were a private design by Thornycroft based on the Thornycroft V and W class to Admiralty specifications. These two ships were ordered in January 1918, at the same time as the first batch of Modified W class. In these two ships, the position of the boiler rooms was reversed, with the two-boiler room forward and the single unit aft. As a result, the funnel arrangements were transposed, with the thick funnel forwards and the narrow funnel aft. In common with other Thornycroft designs, they had characteristic broad, flat-sided funnels. Like the Admiralty modified ships, the Thornycrofts were up-gunned with the BL 4.7 inch Mark I weapon, and they received triple banks of torpedo tubes from the outset. Another feature of recognition was that the QF 2 pdr guns were mounted en echelon amidships, between the funnels. The completion of Witch was delayed by the end of the war, and she was eventually towed to Devonport and completed there at HM Dockyard. Both were converted to the Short Range Escort type during World War II. =Ships= * -- built by John I.

Admiralty modified W classThe two batches of orders placed in 1918 introduced the new BL 4.7 inch Mark I gun, as well as providing triple torpedo tubes as standard. =Ships= Fourteen vessels were ordered to this revised design in January 1918 under the 13th War Programme (as well as the two Thornycroft ships to a variant design), of which seven were subsequently cancelled. * Vansittart -- built by William Beardmore & Company, Dalmuir, laid down 1 July 1918, launched 17 April 1919, completed 5 November 1919, sold for scrapping 25 February 1946. * Vantage -- also from Beardmore, renamed Vimy 1918, laid down 16 September 1918, order cancelled 26 November 1918. * Venomous (ex-Venom) -- built by John Brown & Company, Clydebank, laid down 31 May 1918, launched 21 December 1918, completed 24 August 1919, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947. * Verity -- built by John Brown, laid down 17 May 1918, launched 19 March 1919, completed 17 September 1919, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947. * Volunteer -- built by William Denny & Brothers Limited, Dumbarton, laid down 16 April 1918, launched 17 April 1919, completed 7 November 1919, sold for breaking up 4 March 1947. * Votary -- also from Denny, laid down 18 June 1918, order cancelled 12 April 1919. * Wanderer -- built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Govan, laid down 7 August 1918, launched 1 May 1919, completed 18 September 1919, sold for breaking up 31 January 1946. * Warren -- also from Fairfield, order moved to Chatham Dockyard then cancelled September 1919. * Welcome -- built by Hawthorn Leslie & Company, Hebburn, laid down 9 April 1918, order cancelled 12 April 1919. * Welfare -- also from Hawthorn Leslie, laid down 22 June 1918, order cancelled 12 April 1919. * Whitehall -- built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Wallsend, laid down June 1918, launched 11 September 1919, completed by HM Dockyard Chatham 9 July 1924, sold for breaking up October 1945. * Whitehead -- also by Swan Hunter, order cancelled 12 April 1919. * Wren -- built by Yarrow & Company, laid down June 1918, launched 11 November 1919, completed by HM Dockyard Pembroke Dock 27 January 1923, bombed and sunk by German aircraft off of Aldeburgh 27 July 1940. * Wye -- also by Yarrow, laid down January 1918, order cancelled September 1919. A further thirty-eight vessels were ordered to this design in April 1918 under the 14th War Programme, of which thirty-one were subsequently cancelled and only seven completed.

Australian ships Four of the above ships along with destroyer leader Stuart were transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in October 1933. The ships all served in World War II with three being sunk or scuttled during 1941 and 1942. During their war service in the Mediterranean the five transferred ships made up a group that became famous as the Scrap Iron Flotilla. * Vampire (Admiralty V class leader) * Vendetta (Admiralty V class) * Voyager (Admiralty W class) * Waterhen (Admiralty W class) Conversions for the Second World War From 1937 the disposal of elderly V and W class vessels ceased, and most survivors were converted to fast escort vessels. The onset of the Second World War put a stop to lengthy conversions, but many ships were converted for convoy escort duty. =Long-range escort= The V and W class were designed to support the Grand Fleet in its actions in the North Sea, for which they were required to make fairly short, high speed dashes. Thus, they were unsuitable for the Mid-Ocean Escort Force role to which they found themselves allocated in the Second World War, where speeds over 20 knots were of limited value (as ASDIC rapidly lost efficiency) and endurance was desirable over firepower. To remedy such shortcomings, a number of V and W class were modified into long-range escorts to suit them to this sort of warfare. The small, single-unit boiler room was struck and the resulting space divided into fuel tanks (lower) and accommodation (upper). Not only did this both lower fuel consumption and increase bunkerage, but it provided much needed space for ballooning wartime crews. 'A' and 'Y' guns were landed and replaced with a Hedgehog ahead-throwing weapon and depth charge stowage and launchers, respectively. The torpedo tubes were replaced with a QF 12 pdr anti-aircraft gun and platforms for a pair of 20 mm Oerlikon guns amidships, with a further pair in the bridge wings. Type 271 target indication radar was added in its distinctive \\"lantern\\" dome on the bridge and Type 291 air warning radar was added at the masthead, with High Frequency Direction Finding (HF/DF) fitted in some ships. The maximum speed of the conversions was around . Converted long-range escorts were: * Vanessa * Vanoc * Vanquisher * Velox * Vesper * Versatile * Vidette * Vimy * Vivacious * Viscount * Walker * Warwick * Watchman * Westcott * Winchelsea * Wrestler * Vansittart * Verity * Volunteer * Wanderer * Whitehall =WAIR= The WAIR type conversion supplemented the construction of and -class escorts with their emphasis on anti-aircraft capabilities for east coast service (the exact meaning of 'WAIR' has fallen into obscurity; it is often capitalised suggesting an abbreviation or acronym, but it is most likely derived from W-class anti-AIRcraft). The Thornycroft type leader was also given a WAIR conversion, but as a larger ship she also received a quadruple QF 2 pdr Mark VII mounting. Converted ships were cleared to the main deck level, leaving only the funnels and after shelter deckhouse. The armament was replaced with four QF 4 inch L/45 Mark XVI guns in two twin mountings HA/LA Mark XIX, shipped on the fore and aft shelter decks. The armament was controlled by a Mark II(W) rangefinder - director, fitted with Type 285 radar for target ranging as soon as it became available. A new tower bridge, reminiscent of the Hunt class, was built and the metric Radar Type 286 air warning was added at the foremast head, replaced by Type 291 radar as it became available. The armament was completed by a pair of quadruple 0.5 inch Vickers machine guns on a platform amidships, although sometimes single QF 2 pdr Mark VIII were carried in lieu. These guns were generally sided, but a number of ships had them arranged en echelon to allow cross-deck fire. These light weapons proved to be generally ineffective and were replaced by the 20 mm Oerlikon gun as it became available, although other ships took priority and the older weapons were carried well into 1942 in some cases. Two racks and throwers for depth charges were carried aft, principally for self-defence purposes, although Viceroy sank off the east coast of Scotland on 16 April 1945. Ships were allocated new L-series (escort) pennant numbers upon re-commissioning: * Valentine (L69) * Valorous (L00) * Vega (L41) * Verdun (L93) * Vimiera (L29) * Vivien (L33) * Viceroy (L21) * Westminster (L40) * Whitley (L23) * Winchester (L55) * Wolfhound (L56) * Wolsey (L02) * Woolston (L49) * Wryneck (L04) =Short-range escort= The remaining V and W class were not given either of the former conversions as they were either early war losses, had the valuable BL 4.7 inch main gun or had the modified boiler arrangements of the Thornycroft and Admiralty modified designs with the small room aft. This latter feature proved unsuitable for the long-range escort conversion. Thus, these ships were known as Short-range escorts. The conversion was generally limited to adding more role-specific armaments and new technology as it became available. Additions were made piecemeal, and ships were often lost with only some, or even none, of the following modifications. In common with most elderly destroyers allocated to escort duties in World War II, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed early in the war and replaced with a single QF 12 pdr A/A gun. They also landed 'Y' gun to receive additional space for depth charge gear and stowage. Generally, two 20 mm Oerlikons were added in the bridge wings and (when available) replaced the old 2 pounder guns amidships, 'A' gun was replaced by a Hedgehog weapon and Radar Type 271 target indication was added on the bridge, with Type 286 or 291 air warning fitted at the masthead as and when available. Walpole, Windsor, Witshed and Wivern received an army-pattern semi-automatic twin QF 6 pounder 10 cwt gun in 'A' position for East Coast anti-E boat work. HMS Wolverine (Admiralty Modified W class) as modified into a \\"short range escort\\".

The following vessels were short range escorts (one vessel was allocated a new pennant number in the L ‚Äì escort ‚Äì series): * Venomous * Vortigern * Walpole * Windsor (L94) * Veteran * Whitshed * Wild Swan * Wishart * Witch * Witherington * Wivern * Wolverine =Unmodified escorts= The remainder of the class were unaltered as all (except Worcester) were war losses during 1940 (one vessel was allocated a new pennant number in the L ‚Äì escort ‚Äì series): * Venetia * Wakeful (L91) * Wessex * Whirlwind * Worcester * Wren There remained also the quartet in the Royal Australian Navy ‚Äì Vampire, Vendetta, Voyager and Waterhen ‚Äì which simply had the aft bank of torpedo tubes replaced by a 12pdr A/A gun, and had 2 or 4 x 20mm A/A and 4 x .5in A/A guns added.

Sources The phrase pulsa dinura appears in several stories in classical rabbinic literature (though not with the meaning of a mystical curse): * Adam told Rabbi Akiva that angels were beating him with a stick of fire in punishment for his sins.Kallah Rabbati 2:9 * God punished the angel Metatron with pulsei denura for having mislead Elisha ben Abuyah.Hagigah 15a * God punished the angel Gabriel with pulsei denura for not performing his task properly when Jerusalem was destroyed.Yoma 77a * Elijah was punished in heaven with pulsei denura for having disclosed a heavenly secret to humankind.Bava Metzia 85b * Rava said that if Levi ben Sisi were alive, he would strike with pulsei denura another rabbi who had misrepresented his opinion.Bava Metziah 47a * The term is mentioned once in the Zohar, where it is described as a heavenly punishment against a person who does not fulfill their religious obligations.Zohar, section 3:263c, \\"Raya Mehemna\\" Some adherents of Kabbalah developed the idea of invoking a curse against a sinner, which they termed pulsa deNura. The source for this modern ritual is not to be found in Kabbalah, but among the Hebrew magical manuals of antiquity, such as Sefer HaRazim and The Sword of Moses. In contrast to the ceremony, Judaism discourages praying that an evil person die, and instead recommends praying that the person repent and cease their evil deeds.Brachot 10a Recent usage Accusations of the use of this curse by religious Jews against Jewish figures who have committed major transgressions has been made often over the past 50 years and quoted mostly in Israeli media. As the saying goes in Israel \\"you have not made it in Israeli politics until you've been cursed by the Pulsa DiNura.\\" Early in the 20th century, Haredi Jews in Jerusalem were accused by the media of having recited the curse against the linguist Eliezer Ben Yehuda. However, there is no proof of the curse being performed before 1948.◊û◊ó◊ß◊®: ◊¢◊°◊ß◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ó◊®◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊î◊û◊¶◊ô◊ê◊ï ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊§◊ï◊ú◊°◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê There have been unsubstantiated media reports of the curse being recited against archaeologists and authors. Prior to the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, there were reports that the curse had been recited against him. On February 26, 2012, Tamar Yonah of IsraelNationalNews.com interviewed Yosef Dayan, who, with rabbinical guidance, was involved in the Pulsa DiNura of Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon.Today's King Of Israel?, Israel National News, February 27, 2012. Avigdor Eskin, a member of the Gush Emunim (\\"Bloc of the Faithful\\"), claimed to have recited the following maledictions of the Pulsa diNura on the night of October 2, 1995:◊û◊ó◊ß◊®: ◊¢◊°◊ß◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ó◊®◊ì◊ô◊ù ◊î◊û◊¶◊ô◊ê◊ï ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊§◊ï◊ú◊°◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê; see variant version reported at ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊ó◊®◊ò◊î ◊ë◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ß◊ô◊¶◊ï◊†◊ô: \\"◊î◊§◊ï◊ú◊°◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê ◊¢◊ë◊ì◊î\\" This was preceded by a similar ceremony in Safed.15 ◊©◊†◊î ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô ◊©◊¢◊®◊ö ◊ò◊ß◊° ◊§◊ï◊ú◊°◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê ◊ú◊ô◊¶◊ó◊ß ◊®◊ë◊ô◊ü, ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊í◊ì◊ï◊® ◊ê◊°◊ß◊ô◊ü ◊û◊ê◊ó◊ì ◊ê◊™ ◊î◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ß◊ô◊¶◊ï◊†◊ô ◊ë◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù Rabin was assassinated within the month. In July 2005, the Israeli media, without citing sources, reported that opponents of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza recited the Pulsa deNura in the old cemetery of Rosh Pina, asking the \\"Angel of Death\\" to kill Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.\\"◊¢◊®◊õ◊†◊ï ◊ò◊ß◊° ◊§◊ï◊ú◊°◊ê ◊ì◊†◊ï◊®◊ê ◊ï◊ë◊ô◊ß◊©◊†◊ï ◊©◊©◊®◊ï◊ü ◊ô◊û◊ï◊™\\" Six months later Sharon suffered two strokes and was in a coma, fighting for his life, until his death on January 11, 2014. However, most analysts link this to his age (77) and obesity. On November 7, 2006, the Edah HaChareidis said it was considering placing the curse on the organizers of the Pride parade scheduled to march in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006. Army Radio interviewed Rabbi Shmuel Papenheim, who announced, \\"The Rabbinical Court has held a special session and discussed placing a 'pulsa denura' on those who have had a hand in organizing the march.\\" Papenheim, editor of the Haredi religious umbrella organization's weekly magazine, added that the rabbis were also considering placing the curse \\"against the policemen who beat Haredi Jews\\".Eida Haredit Rabbinical Counsel Considers Curse on Parade Organizers, Israel National News, November 7, 2006.

It was the first tape drive for a commercially sold computer. The UNISERVO used metal tape: a thin strip of nickel-plated phosphor bronze (called Vicalloy) 1200 feet long. These metal tape reels were very heavy. Data was recorded in eight channels on the tape (six for the data value, one parity channel for error checking, and one timing channel) at a density of 128 bits per inch. The tape could be moved at 100 inches per second, giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 characters per second. Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each. Making allowance for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. The UNISERVO supported both forward and backward modes on read or write operation. This offered significant advantages in data sorting and merging applications. The data transfers to/from the UNIVAC I processor were fully buffered in a one block dedicated memory, permitting instruction execution in parallel with tape movement and data transfer. The internal serial data path permitted inserting a tape data block into main memory in one instruction. UNIVAC continued to use the name UNISERVO for later models of tape drive (e.g., UNISERVO II, UNISERVO IIIC, UNISERVO VIII-C) for later computers in their product line. The UNISERVO II could read metal tapes from the UNIVAC I as well as use higher density PET film base/ferric oxide media tapes that became the industry standard. While UNIVAC was first with computer tape, and had higher performance than contemporary IBM tape drives, IBM was able to set the data interchange standard. UNIVAC was later forced to be compatible with the IBM technology. Technical details The tape motion in the UNISERVO I was controlled by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. Supply and take-up reel motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to the invention of the vacuum column buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a connector link to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes. The later UNISERVO IIA and IIIA omitted the plastic wear tape and felt wipers, since they were primarily used with PET film-base magnetic tape. Both continued the use of single capstan drives and were vacuum column designs. The IIIC and later tapes used NRZI encoding to be compatible with the IBM 729 series tape drives which set the industry standard for data interchange. Ironically, IBM then later switched to phase encoding in its 1600-bit-per-inch tape generation because of its superior data reliability.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is the capital city of the province of Bulacan as the seat of the provincial government. The city is north of Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. It is one of the major suburbs conurbated to Metro Manila, situated in the southwestern part of Bulacan, in the Central Luzon Region (Region 3) in the island of Luzon and part of the Metro Luzon Urban Beltway Super Region. Malolos was the site of the constitutional convention of 1898, known as the Malolos Convention, that led to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic, at the sanctuary of the Barasoain Church. The convent of the Malolos Cathedral served as the presidential palace at that time. Malolos gave birth to the first constitutional republic in Asia. History Adelantado Don Miguel Lopez de Legazpi conquered the 8 villages along Malolos River and integrated it into one entity dated November 14, 1571, and constituted it as an Encomienda de MalolosBlair and Robertson, The Philippine Islands, volume 34, page 304-310, paragraph 3 the Adelantado entrusted the settlements to conquistador Don Marcos de Herrera. On April 5, 1572, Legazpi merges the encomiendas of Malolos and Calumpit into a single entity to form a new town of Calumpit with Juan Moron and Herrera as co-encomenderos. On April 15, 1572, Legazpi entrusted 6 villages along Atlag River and given it to Don Jeronimo Tirado.Historia General Archivo de Sevilla Nine years later, Malolos was officially established as a town and included it in Bulacan and dismembered on Alcaldia de Calumpit on June 11, 1580 and accepted as priory with Fray Matheo de Mendoza as its first minister in an Augustinian Council held in Tondo Convent but the civil administration still belongs to its encomendero at that time, Don Jeronimo Tirado. From the very beginning, Tagalog made up the majority of the Malolos populace although it was said that Malolos has its Kapampangan origin. They were led by prominent ancient families, among them are descendants of the royal native pre-colonial clans of Gatbontons, Gatmaitan, Gatsalian (Gatchalians), Dimagibas, Lakandolas, Ladia and Lacancales and in the 17th-19th centuries, Sangley (Chinese) families probably came from China, through Tondo and Binondo, such as Chichioco, Cojuangco, Chiong, Chico, Cunanan, Tantocos, Tanchangco, Tanjosoy, Tengco, Tenjeco, Tiongson, Lomotan, Manahan, joined by Spanish clans of Adriano, Bautista, Jacinto, Reyes, Santos, Rustia, de Leon, Agustin, Vasquez, Valenzuela, Crisostomo and Estrella. Chinese traders settled in Malolos starting in 1670, due to economic progress in town. They setlled here and married the natives. The settlers are increasing, and Malolos began engaging with texile, rice production. However, the Chinese are expelled from this town on June 30, 1755, due to its political and social scandals. On August 31, 1859, the town of Malolos was divided into three independent towns; \\"Malolos\\", \\"Barasoain, and \\"Santa Isabel\\". These new towns are former districts of Malolos, with own respective Presidente Municipal and Parish priests. With the beginning of American rule in 1903, these towns were again reunited into a single municipality. The two other districts became barangays under the political jurisdiction of Malolos. A major factor in Malolos' growth and development was the opening of the Manila- Dagupan railways or Ferrocaril de Manila-Dagupan (Spanish) in April 1892. With the advent of the railroad came new ideas from Manila and other places. Another factor is Malolos proximity to industrial and business centers. Malolos was first organized into a formal municipal unit in 1822 when the first \\"alcalde constitucional\\" or municipal head was appointed. He was Jorge de Victoria, a Filipino, who like all succeeding \\"alcaldes\\", served for one year. He was followed by thirty-one other \\"alcaldes\\", with Juan Dimagiba as the thirty-first. In 1859, Malolos was subdivided into three administrative districts; Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Juan Dimagiba became the first \\"alcalde\\" of the down-scaled Malolos. There were 12 others who served as \\"alcaldes\\" from 1859 to 1879, the first one being Mariano C. Cristobal and the second being Capitan Tomas Tanchanco, whose term marked the start of civil turmoil in the town.Malolos Historical Digest, June 2000 =Philippine Republic= The Barasoain Church The Malolos Congress of 1899 in session Filipino soldiers in Malolos, 1899 Malolos is the historical site of the constitutional convention of 1898 that led to the establishment of the First Philippine Republic, the first republic in Asia, led by Emilio Aguinaldo. Malolos served as the capital of the short-lived republic from 1898 to 1899. In 1899, after the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Scientifico Literaria de Filipinas was established in Malolos, Bulacan. It offered Law as well as Medicine, Surgery and Notary Public; Academia Militar,(the Philippine's First Military School) which was established on October 25, 1898; and The Burgos Institute, (the Philippine's first law school) and an exclusive school for boys. The Congress of the Revolutionary Government of the Philippines convened in Barasoain Church in Malolos on September 15, 1898. On the 18th, Aguinaldo proclaimed Malolos as the capital of the Philippines. The first important act of the Congress was the ratification on September 29, 1898, of the independence proclamation at Kawit, Cavite of June 12, 1898. On October 19, 1898, by virtue of an act of Congress, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established. It was in Malolos on December 20, 1898, when Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo declared December 30 of every year as a day of national mourning. The greatest achievement and for which the Malolos Congress was known was the framing of the Malolos Constitution, prepared by a committee headed by Felipe Calder√≥n, was approved by the congress after amendments have been made on January 20, 1899, sanctioned by Aguinaldo the next day and promulgated on January 22. The last congressional act of the Malolos Congress was the inauguration of the Philippine Republic with Aguinaldo as the President on January 23, 1899, amidst the people's jubilation. On March 31, 1899, at the height of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Aguinaldo ordered Gen. Antonio Luna to set the Malolos Cathedral including its huge silver altar on fire as part of their strategy called \\"Scorched-earth Policy\\" where everything will be rendered useless. Malolos was totally destroyed when the Americans captured the capital. Aguinaldo escaped to San Fernando, Pampanga before the American Forces arrived at Malolos. =Malolos as the capital of Bulacan= More than a year after the 1899 Battle of Malolos and the victory of and occupation by American forces, the national seat of power was officially conferred again to the City of Manila and on February 27, 1901, by the virtue of Public Law Number 88 of the Philippine Commission, the commission officially transferred the capital seat from the heavily damaged nearby town of Bulakan to the Town of Malolos and it became the capital of Bulacan. The Casa Presidencia de Malolos was converted as the new Casa Real of Bulacan (became Casa Real Shrine) making it as the new Official Office and Residence of Governor until 1930 when the new Provincial Capitol Building in Barrio Guinhawa, also in Malolos was built. Bulacan Provincial Capitol in Malolos City built in 1930 =Governments of Malolos after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War= *During American Period After the War, the Americans appointed a martial law administrator in the person of Jose Reyes Tiongson. He served as \\"presidente politico militar\\" from 1901 to 1902. With the capture of Pres. and Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela and the defeat of most of the Filipino armed forces all over the country, the Americans began to put up a network of local government units. The municipality of Malolos was re-organized, composed of the districts of Malolos, Barasoain and Santa Isabel. Appointed \\"presidente municipal\\" or town mayor was Ramon Gonzalez de Leon of Sitio Tampoy, (grandfather of TV host Joey de Leon) one of the original members of the Katipunan Balangay Apuy. He was in the post for two years, 1903 to 1905. He and the nine others who followed him were all appointive officials. When the Philippines became a commonwealth, Leon Valencia was elected mayor in 1937, the first ever elected. Diosdado Dimagiba succeeded him in 1940 but had to vacate the position because of the Japanese conquest. Also in this period, the Malolos Municipal Hall facing the Malolos Church was built, in a manner of Neo-Classical Roman Style.Malolos Historical Digest, June 2000 *During Japanese Occupation The Japanese appointed two \\"punong bayan\\" or mayors, Luis Peralta and Ignacio Tapang. After the joint US and Philippine Commonwealth armed forces liberated Malolos in March 1945, Adonis P. Maclang of the guerrillas' Bulacan Military Area was appointed guerrilla mayor of the town, before battle for the liberation of Bulacan, the local Filipino forces of the 3rd and 32nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was liberated in Malolos to helping the local guerrilla resistance fighters of the Bulacan Guerrilla Unit and American troops of the U.S. Army against the Japanese in 1945 at the end of World War II, followed by the appointment of Isberto Crisostomo as civilian town mayor in 1946. The first post-war election was held in 1946 and Carlos Maclang was elected mayor. =Contemporary history= In 1998, Malolos was the site again for another Presidential inauguration of Joseph Estrada on June 30, 1998, in Barasoain Church as the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Estrada, whose real surname is Ejercito, traced his ancestry to the Ejercitos who were prominent in the history of Malolos. The 280M Malolos Steel Flyover It was in summer of 2004, the construction of the Malolos flyover marks a new milestone in their flourishing history being the first in the city. The structure, part of the former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's Bridge Program, the construction was undertaken in a record-breaking 60 days only according to the Department of Public Works and Highways. The structure was built to solve the daily traffic jam at the place, which have become a bane to motorist and also to employees in both private and government offices in this city. This remarkable feat hastened not only the city's development in commerce and trade but its neighboring municipalities as well. In July 28‚Äì30, 2008, the city was chosen to host the first National Conference for Philippine-Spanish Relations. The conference's theme was \\"Philippine-Spanish Relations: Sharing Common History and Culture.\\" This is a project both of the Province of Bulacan's research arm, Center for Bulacan Studies of Bulacan State University and by the Samahang Pangkasaysayan ng Bulacan, Incorporated. = Cityhood = The charter of the City of Malolos was first passed through Republic Act 8754 on November 4, 1999. The bill's author was then Rep. Wilhelmino M. Sy-Alvarado. A plebiscite was conducted on December 18, 1999, where the votes \\"not\\" in favor of cityhood won. During the plebiscite, the clash between the pro and anti- cityhood groups reached the peak when the allegedly fraud done by the antis to manipulate the results in able to win the \\"No\\" votes gathering 11,535 count against 9,321 \\"Yes\\" votes. Due to the electoral fraud on Malolos cityhood plebiscite, then Congressman Wilhelmino Alvarado and then Mayor Restituto Roque filed an electoral protest at the Commission on Elections dated December 29, 1999 to recount the results of the plebiscite. The recount reversed the initial decision and the Commission found out that 10,746 votes approved the cityhood and only 8,402 against the conversion. The protest was granted by the Second Division of Commission on Elections, per Resolution No. Election Protest Case 99-2, October 8, 2001, the COMELEC affirmed that the \\"YES\\" vote won so the Cityhood of Malolos is valid as of December 18, 1999.http://beta.maloloscity.gov.ph/government/history/highlights-of-malolos- history/malolos In 2010, the Malolos City Council passes the City Resolution 24-2010 declaring 18 December of every year to be celebrated as Cityhood Day. =The invalidation of R.A 9591 the Lone District of Malolos Act= On December 19, 2007, then Senator Mar Roxas introduced and filed Senate Bill 1986 that seeks to amend section 57 of Republic Act 8754, the component law converting Malolos from a municipality to a component city. The bill was read on First Reading and Referred to the Committee on Rules on the same day as it was filed. On May 13, 2008, it was referred to the Committee on Local Government, on motion of Senator Francis Pangilinan. On October 6, 2008, the bill was sponsored by Senator Benigno S. Aquino III, and co-sponsored by Senators Richard J. Gordon and Mar Roxas. In the House of the Representatives, House Bill 3693 was filed on March 4, 2008 by then Representative Ma. Victoria Sy-Alvarado. The Committee on Local Government, of the House of the Representatives, approved House Bill 3162, declaring Malolos City as a lone congressional district separate and distinct from the first congressional district of the province of Bulacan. The said House Bill was substituted by House Bill 3693, which had been approved by the House on April 29, 2008; transmitted on May 5; and was received by the Senate on May 6, 2008. The Republic Act 9591, entitled \\"An Act Amending Section 57 of Republic Act No. 8754, otherwise known as the Charter of the City of Malolos\\" was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on April 29, 2008 and February 16, 2009 respectively. It was transmitted to the Office of the President on March 31, 2009. The Act lapsed into law on May 1, 2009 without the signature of the President, in accordance with Article VI, Section 27 (1) of the Constitution. The Commission on Elections (COMELEC) created a resolution, Resolution Number 09-0544, in the matter of Republic Act No. 9591 on the allocation of one (1) legislative district for the City of Malolos. On January 28, 2010, the Supreme Court declared the creation of the new legislative district as unconstitutional.http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideNews.htm?f=2010/january/28/news3.isx&d;=2010/january/28 The Supreme Court further reaffirmed on March 10, 2010 its decision to declare the creation of the new legislative district as unconstitutional, thus, the city remains part of the 1st District of Bulacan. Demographics As of 2015, the Philippine Statistics Authority released the official result of 2015 census in which Malolos City has a population of people, with a density of , an increase of 17,129 people from the 2010 census. There are 47,362 households in the city. Majority of the Malolos households usually lives along the major roads. It has an average crime rate of 6.28% and has a crime solution efficiency of 97.11%. =Language and ethnicity= The majority of the Malole√±os (or Malolenyo in Filipino) traces their roots to Tagalog ethnicity although there are also Kapampangan and other ethnicities who migrated to the city. The vernacular language is Filipino, in the form of Tagalog, while Philippine English is the language most widely used in education and business throughout the city. Although Malolos is the city where the Filipinos established the Spanish as their only official language in the first constitution, the native speakers of Spanish still alive are reduced to the very old members of a handful of families. Barangays Malolos City is subdivided into 51 barangays that are spread over a land area of consisting of agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, bodies of water, fishponds, marshes and roads. Many of the name of the barangays were derived from the name of common Philippine trees, because Malolos was once a vast virgin land and forests, before the Spaniards came and Christianized the natives. While others were named in honor of their patron saints. {class=\\"wikitable sortable collapsible\\" style=\\"text-align:right;font-size:95%;\\" |+Barangays of the City of Malolos  Map  Barangay

The TCPA limits the use of automatic dialing systems, artificial or prerecorded voice messages, SMS text messages, and fax machines. It also specifies several technical requirements for fax machines, autodialers, and voice messaging systems‚Äîprincipally with provisions requiring identification and contact information of the entity using the device to be contained in the message.  General provisions  Unless the recipient has given prior express consent, the TCPA and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules under the TCPA generally:; 47 C.F.R. ¬ß 64.1200 * Prohibits solicitors from calling residences before 8 a.m. or after 9 pm, local time. * Requires solicitors maintain a company-specific \\"do-not-call\\" (DNC) list of consumers who asked not to be called; the DNC request must be honored for 5 years. * Requires solicitors honor the National Do Not Call Registry. * Requires solicitors provide their name, the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made, and a telephone number or address at which that person or entity may be contacted. * Prohibits solicitations to residences that use an artificial voice or a recording.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(B); FCC Regulations exempt non- solicitation calls. * Prohibits any call made using automated telephone equipment or an artificial or prerecorded voice to an emergency line (e.g., \\"911\\"), a hospital emergency number, a physician's office, a hospital/health care facility/elderly room, a cellular telephone, or any service for which the recipient is charged for the call.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(b)(1)(A) * Prohibits autodialed calls that engage two or more lines of a multi-line business. * Prohibits unsolicited advertising faxes. * In the event of a violation of the TCPA, a subscriber may (1) sue for up to $500 for each violation or recover actual monetary loss, whichever is greater, (2) seek an injunction, or (3) both.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(b)(3)(a),(b) * In the event of a willful violation of the TCPA, a subscriber may sue for up to three time the damages, i.e. $1,500, for each violation.47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(b)(3) When Congress passed the TCPA in 1991, it delegated the do-not-call rules to the FCC. Congress suggested that the FCC's do-not-call regulations \\"may require the establishment and operation of a single national database.\\"47 U.S.C. ¬ß 227(c)(3) The FCC did not adopt a single national database but rather required each company to maintain its own do-not- call database.47 C.F.R. ¬ß 64.1200(e)(2)(vi) October 1, 1997 edition. The FCC's initial do-not-call list regulations were ineffective at proactively stopping unsolicited calls because the consumer had to make a do-not-call request for each telemarketer. In 2003, the Federal Trade Commission -- not the FCC and not the agency entrusted with the TCPA -- established the National Do Not Call Registry and implemented regulations prohibiting commercial telemarketers from making unsolicited sales calls to persons who did not wish to receive them. After being challenged in court by the telemarketing industry, the National Do Not Call Registry received Congressional ratification in the speedy enactment of Do-Not-Call Implementation Act. In 2013, the Philadelphia Federal Appeals Court held that consent to receive calls from collectors, banks, or telemarketers to consumers‚Äô cell phones may be revoked by the consumer. The CAN-SPAM Act made a minor amendment to the TCPA to explicitly apply the TCPA to calls and faxes originating from outside the U.S. The portions of the TCPA related to unsolicited advertising faxes were amended by the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. Unusual statutory provision Though the TCPA is a federal statute, suits brought by consumers against violators are frequently filed in state courts.Robert R. Biggerstaff, State Courts and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991: must States Opt-in? Can States Opt-out? 33 Conn. L. Rev. 407 (2001). The TCPA is unusual in that the language creating a private right of action led to conflicting views on whether the federal courts had federal question subject matter jurisdiction. The TCPA provides in relevant part: \\"A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of that State. ‚Ä¶\\" Prior to January 2012, there was a circuit split among the federal appeals courts on the issue of whether federal courts have federal question, diversity jurisdiction (individually or under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005), or whether the state courts have exclusive jurisdiction.Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 421 Fed.Appx. 920, 921 (11th Cir. 2010); Murphy v. Lanier, 204 F.3d 911, 915 (9th Cir. 2000) (federal courts lack federal-question jurisdiction over TCPA claims); ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc., 156 F.3d 513, 519 (3rd Cir. 1998) (same); Foxhall Realty Law Offices, Inc. v. Telecommunications Premium Servs., Ltd., 156 F.3d 432, 434 (2nd Cir. 1998) (same); Chair King, Inc. v. Houston Cellular Corp., 131 F.3d 507, 514 (5th Cir. 1997) (same); International Science & Technology Inst. v. Inacom Communications, Inc., 106 F.3d 1146, 1158 (4th Cir. 1997) (same); Charvat v. EchoStar Satellite, LLC, 630 F.3d 459, 463‚Äì465 (6th Cir. 2010) (federal courts have federal-question jurisdiction over TCPA actions), Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 427 F.3d 446, 447 (7th Cir. 2005) (same) In 2012, the Supreme Court decided Mims v. Arrow Fin. Servs., LLC, which resolved the circuit split by concluding that \\"The TCPA's permissive grant of jurisdiction to state courts does not deprive the U.S. district courts of federal-question jurisdiction over private TCPA suits.\\"Mims v. Arrow Financial Services 132 S. Ct. 740, 742 (2012) Major court cases The TCPA's constitutionality was challenged by telemarketers soon after it was enacted. Two cases, Moser v. FCC, 46 F.3d 970 (9th Cir. 1995) cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1161 (1995) and Destination Ventures Ltd. v. FCC, 46 F.3d 54 (9th Cir. 1995) effectively settled this issue finding the restrictions in the TCPA were constitutional. The Ninth Circuit held that the TCPA applies to unsolicited cellular telephone text messages advertising the commercial availability of goods or services as \\"calls\\" made in violation of the act: In June 2007, a ruling (later overturned) was handed down in class action case Satterfield v. Simon & Schuster, No. C 06-2893 CW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46325 (N.D. Cal. June 26, 2007), a case involving the transmission of SMS text messages promoting a popular author's \\"mobile club\\" to cellular phones, such as the one used by a seven-year-old child. The defendants, the publishing company that contracted for the transmission of the promotional messages and the service provider that actually sent the messages, argued that the named subscriber, the child's mother, had consented to the transmission of promotional messages when, to receive a free ringtone, she checked the box in an online form labeled \\"Yes! I would like to receive promotions from Nextones affiliates and brands‚Ä¶.\\" Judge Claudia Wilken ruled that the SMS text messages are not covered by the TCPA, first, because the manner in which the SMS messages were sent does not fit the statutory definition of an \\"automatic telephone dialing system,\\" and second, because the plaintiff had agreed to receive promotional messages under a broadly worded consent provision, executed in connection with the download of a free ringtone. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the potentially 90 million dollar lawsuit against publishing giant Simon & Schuster. A settlement was finally approved by Judge Claudia Wilken on August 6, 2010, which would pay out $175 to each class member who files a claim. In April 2005 a class action lawsuit against Jamster! was filed.\\"Jamster slammed for mobile selling practices\\", InfoWorld, April 5, 2005. Retrieved March 15, 2007. The lawsuit alleges that Jamster! scammed cellular telephone customers through the use of fraudulent and deceptive advertisements. The plaintiffs argue that the ads in question offered one free ring tone to cell phone customers who responded to the ad via text message, but failed to inform users that they would be subscribed to a monthly service.Summary of FORD V. VERISIGN, INC., JAMSTER!, et al., Callahan, McCune and Willis. Retrieved March 15, 2007. The lawsuit was combined with four others and settled in November 2009.http://jamstermarketinglitigation.com/pdfs/SettlementAgreement.pdfhttp://www.casd.uscourts.gov/ 05-cv-00819-JM In August 2014, Capital One Financial Corp., AllianceOne Receivables Management Inc., Leading Edge Recovery Solutions, LLC and Capital Management Services, L.P. entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers' cellphones without consent. This is the largest proposed cash settlement under the TCPA to date. It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the \\"prior express written consent\\" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013. The United States Supreme Court resolved a significant circuit split to decide that federal courts have federal question subject matter jurisdiction in Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 US 368, 132 S. Ct. 740, 181 L. Ed. 2d 881 (2012). In 2015, Congress added an exemption to ¬ß 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) to allow for robocalls related to federally-owed debt collection. This resulted in the Supreme Court case Barr v. American Assn. of Political Consultants, Inc., 591 U.S. ___ (2020), which ruled this created a content-based restriction on free speech that failed strict scrutiny, and invalidated the exemption but leaving the rest of the statue in place due to severability. In 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found two text messages were enough to obtain Article III standing. In 2019, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals found a single text message was not enough to obtain Article III standing under TCPA. In 2020, the Southern District of Texas found a single text message was enough to obtain Article III standing. In 2020, the Eastern District of Texas found a single missed call using a localized number was enough trigger Article III standing under TCPA. The court reasoned, \\"At issue in this case is a missed call, not a single, unsolicited text message. It only takes one glance at a text message to recognize it is for an extended warranty for a car you have never owned or a cruise you have won from a raffle you never entered. A missed call with a familiar area code, on the other hand, is more difficult to immediately dismiss as an automated message.\\" Andrew Perrong has filed at least 45 TCPA lawsuits against a wide variety of businesses, ranging from chimney sweeps and collection agencies to large businesses like Verizon and Citibank. Perrong has demanded tens of thousands of dollars in some cases, and most of his suits are settled quickly. It is unknown how much money Perrong has made from his settlements. His first settlement occurred in 2015 while a senior at La Salle College High School. See also *Telemarketing *Autodialer *Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez References Law review articles * Robert R.

History =The First World War= The station at Shawbury was first used for military flying training in 1917 by the Royal Flying Corps. No. 29 (Training) Wing formed on 1 September 1917 with three training squadrons, No. 10 Squadron, No. 29 (Australian) (Training) Squadron and No. 67 Squadron. Several different types of aircraft were operated which caused difficulties with training and maintenance. Two of the squadrons combined to form 9 Training Depot Station on 1 March 1918, the other moving to Gloucestershire. Training continued on a more organised basis until the end of the war.Smith, 1981, p. 164 The airfield closed in May 1920 when strength of the RAF was drastically reduced. The hangars and other buildings were demolished and the land was returned to agricultural use. =The Second World War= In February 1938 the station was reactivated as a training establishment, firstly used by No. 11 Service Flying Training School and an Aircraft Storage Unit (ASU) which was operated by No. 27 Maintenance Unit. The airfield also had Relief Landing Grounds at RAF Bridleway Gate and RAF Bratton, with additional satellite landing grounds at RAF Hinstock, RAF Hodnet and RAF Weston Park. Shawbury primarily prepared pilots for operational squadrons, with the main aircraft being the Airspeed Oxford. In 1944 it became the home of the Central Navigation School, which had moved from RAF Cranage in Cheshire, primarily concerned with improving the standard of air navigation in bombers. =Post WW2= Westland Wessex HC.2 of No. 2 Flying Training School which was based at RAF Shawbury between 1976 and 1997. In 1950, the School of Air Traffic Control moved to Shawbury, combining to form the Central Navigation and Control School. No. 27 Maintenance Unit continued its aircraft storage and scrapping work at Shawbury until disbandment in July 1972. Shawbury became home to No. 2 Flying Training School in 1976, tasked with basic and advanced helicopter training and operating the Aerospatiale Gazelle and Westland Wessex in those roles respectively. = 1990s and 2000s = leftNo. 2 Flying Training School was disbanded in March 1997 so that in April 1997 the station could start providing training of helicopter pilots for all three of the UK's armed services, under the newly formed Defence Helicopter Flying School. Between 2001 and 2014 Shawbury was home to the Assault Glider Trust, a charity building a non-flying replica Horsa glider for museum display. The station's physical recreation training centre, named the Jubilee Hall Sports and Fitness Centre to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, was opened by Prince Michael of Kent on 24 April 2012. In April 2016 the Central Air Traffic Control School (CATCS) was renamed the School of Air Operations Control (SAOC) and came under the control of the newly created Defence College of Airspace Control. = Transition to Juno = In 2016, the Ministry of Defence selected Ascent Flight Training to deliver the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS), a 25-year contract to provide fixed-wing elementary, basic, multi- engine and fast-jet pilot training, rear crew training and helicopter training to the UK military. Subsequently, Ascent selected Airbus Helicopters to supply thirty-two helicopters to replace the DHFS Squirrel and Griffin aircraft. Airbus provided twenty-nine H135 airframes, known as Juno HT1 and three H145 airframes, known as Jupiter HT1. Due to the reduced requirement for search and rescue (SAR) training, following the privatisation of SAR provision, only three of the larger H145 aircraft are required, compared to the larger number of Griffins which were operated. The new fleet is entirely twin-engine, replacing the single engine Squirrel, as nearly all helicopters now operated by the UK military are twin-engined, apart from the Gazelle AH1, which is due for retirement. During 2016 and 2017, refurbishment of existing and construction of new buildings was undertaken as part of the contract. The work was undertaken by Kier Construction and included a new training school building, including space for flight simulators and refurbishment of hangars. The first two Juno and a Jupiter were delivered to Shawbury on 3 April 2017. Deliveries continue throughout 2017 and early 2018, with the final Juno arriving on 24 May 2018. With the new aircraft achieving full training capability, Squirrel and Griffin operations ceased on 1 April 2018 and the aircraft returned to civilian use. Other changes included the DHFS becoming a sub-unit of the Shawbury station headquarters, rather than an independent lodger unit, which it had been since in creation in 1997. Two wings were created, 2 Maritime Air Wing (2 MAW) and No. 9 Regiment. The School of Aerospace Battle Management, part of the Defence College of Air and Space Operations, moved to Shawbury from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland in August 2019. DHFS was re-badged as No. 1 Flying Training School during February 2020 and continues to provide helicopter training the British armed forces. Role and operations RAF Shawbury's mission statement is \\"To provide a safe, efficient, and effective airfield base environment; to enable and support, commanded, lodged and parented units; and to deliver wider Defence and RAF tasks as directed\\". The station is home to the School of Air Operations Control. = No.1 Flying Training School = Airbus Juno HT1 of No.1 Flying Training School. No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) (formerly the Defence Helicopter Flying School) provides basic helicopter pilot training for the RAF, Royal Navy and Army Air Corps (AAC), as well as foreign and commonwealth countries, using twenty-nine Airbus Juno HT1. No. 1 FTS comprises two main elements, 2 Maritime Air Wing (2 MAW) and No. 9 Regiment. 2 MAW includes No. 660 Squadron of the AAC and 705 Naval Air Squadron and provide basic helicopter flying training. No. 9 Regiment comprises No. 60 Squadron of the RAF and No. 670 Squadron of the AAC in the advanced helicopter flying training. No. 202 Squadron is also part of No. 1 FTS and operates the Airbus Jupiter HT1 at RAF Valley in Wales. Airbus provides and maintains the helicopters and Babcock and Lockheed Martin have contracts for infrastructure and ground Based Training Equipment. No. has 161 instructors, 102 of which are military and 59 which are civilian. The school is expected to train 286 students per annum. Four classes per annum year go through Shawbury on six- month Basic Rotary courses, two with 705 NAS and two with No. 660 Squadron AAC. During the initial course students are taught basic rotary-wing skills and emergency handling, including engine-off landings, leading to a first solo flight and a handling check. Students then develop their basic skills into more applied techniques such as non-procedural instrument flying, basic night flying, low-level and formation flying, mountain flying in Snowdonia and an introduction to winching for FAA students, in the advanced phase lasting 8 months. = Central Flying School (Helicopter) Squadron = The RAF Central Flying School (Helicopter) Squadron provides Qualified Helicopter Instructor and Qualified Helicopter Crewman Instructor (QHI/QHCI) training for Juno and Jupiter. The unit trains crews from all three UK armed services as well as foreign air arms. = School of Aerospace Battle Management = The School of Aerospace Battle Management, part of the Defence College of Airspace Control, moved to Shawbury from RAF Boulmer in Northumberland in August 2019. Formerly called the School of Fighter Control (SFC), it was located at RAF Boulmer from 1990 to 2019. Commanded by a Wing Commander, the School of Fighter Control was formed in 1946 and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II awarded the Unit its own badge in 1958, which includes a Torch and Pointer. The school's motto is 'Disce ut Dirigas' which freely translates to 'Learn in order that you may guide. = Aircraft Maintenance and Storage Unit = Several RAF aircraft types are stored in long-term reserve at RAF Shawbury. These aircraft are stored in four specially de-humidified hangars at different states of readiness and can be brought back into active service if required. Other aircraft types which are no longer required for operational service are also stored pending their disposal. The unit is operated by FB Heliservices, part of Cobham.

The UKMFTS contract amendment worth ¬£183 million is to create further rear crew training capacity. The additional aircraft and simulator are expected to be based at RAF Shawbury, where infrastructure will also be enhanced to accommodate extra students.

Time, Al-Qaeda Moneyman Caught, May 1, 2003) is a Pakistani citizen in U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Charges against him include \\"facilitating the 9/11 attackers, acting as a courier for Osama bin Laden and plotting to crash a plane packed with explosives into the U.S. consulate in Karachi.\\" Member of the same al-Baluchi clan as Khalid Sheikh Muhammad (KSM) and Ramzi Yousef, U.S. officials state that he was a \\"key Lieutenant\\" of his uncle KSM who assisted KSM in the execution of the September 11 attacks, and that he told investigators that he had sought help in al-Qaeda's efforts to develop biological weapons to use against its enemies. He reportedly married and then divorced Aafia Siddiqui, the Pakistani scientist convicted of shooting at US soldiers and incarcerated in the United States.Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.246 In 2018, the United Nations called for his immediate release from arbitrary detention. Early life Ammar al-Baluchi was born in Kuwait City, Kuwait, and is the maternal nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (organizer of the 9/11 attacks) and cousin of Ramzi Yousef, the organizer of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The extended family of al-Baluchi is ethnically Baluchi and originally from Balochistan. The family patriarch and his brother were lay Deobandi preachers. They moved the family to Kuwait in the 1960s.Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.60 Baluchi grew up in Kuwait but spent most of teenage years in Iranian Baluchistan,Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.219 but is a citizen of Pakistan. Trained as a computer technician, he dressed in Western clothes and \\"introduced himself as a businessman\\", but had been \\"groomed ... since boyhood\\" by his cousins and uncles \\"to join their clandestine war,\\" according to journalist Debra Scroggins. According to a U.S. government biography, his \\"chief mentor\\" was his cousin and 1993 World Trade Center bombing orchestrator Ramzi Yousef, \\"who taught him in the early 1990s in Iran about the important of war against the West.\\" He is fluent in English and worked at Mohammed's honey-processing company in Karachi for a while before being hired in 1998 as a computer technician for Modern Electronics Corporation in Dubai. According to some evidence given at the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, he was \\"very open-minded and western-oriented\\", while his ex-wife told investigators he was \\"a very strict Muslim\\" who opposed his wife's leaving the home. Career in jihad = Preparation for 9/11 = According to a U.S. government biography, Balouchi \\"volunteered his services\\" to uncle KSM in 1997. According to U.S. officials, the majority of money that came to the Saudi hijackers for the September 11 attacks was transferred through Baluchi and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. The 9/11 Commission reported that he \\"helped them with plane tickets, traveler's checks, and hotel reservations\\", and \\"taught them about everyday aspects of life in the West, such as purchasing clothes and ordering food\\". In his defence, Baluchi claims that he often helped people in Dubai with such things to supplement his income, and he had no way of knowing whether any of them were criminals. On 10 October 1998, Baluchi used his passport to open a bank account with the Emirates Bank International, using the name \\"Ali\\" based on his kunya name Ibn Abdulaziz Ali and listing his employer's address with PO box 16958, Jebel Ali, Dubai. He was then introduced to Marwan al-Shehhi by his uncle, and Shehhi allegedly asked him to help transfer money from Shehhi's company in Dubai to his company in the United States, ostensibly to help avoid banking fees if he transferred the money himself. In January 2000, an order using Shehhi's credit card had a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator program, a Boeing 767 flight deck video, and some flight attendant literature and flight manuals shipped to Baluchi's work address. Baluchi then shipped them to his uncle to pass onto Shehhi.9/11 Commission Report Findings FBI Report: \\"Summary of Penttbom Investigation\\", Feb 29, 2004. pp. 78 On 18 April, Baluchi sent a wire transfer of $5,000 to Adel Rafeea, the administrator of the Islamic Center of San Diego, from the Wall Street Exchange Centre in Dubai, using his PO Box, passport and listing his phone number as 0506745651. Rafeaa later claimed that Nawaf al-Hazmi had asked him to accept the money on his behalf. Tracing the calls made to Baluchi's phone number, authorities discovered that he had received 16 calls from 28‚Äì30 June from a pre-paid Voicestream mobile purchased in Manhattan on 4 June. The phone was deactivated on 11 July, and authorities allege it belonged to Atta, while Baluchi insisted that he only ever spoke with Shehhi, who had hired him. Around this time, Baluchi complained to Mohammed that he couldn't do all this additional work himself, and his uncle told him that Mustafa al-Hawsawi would co-ordinate with him to act as an assistant. On 29 June, a man named \\"Isam Mansur\\" wired $5,000 to the Western Union at 1440 Broadway in New York, where Shehhi picked it up. This is alleged to have been Baluchi, since two later direct payments into Shehhi's Sun Trust account from the Exchange Center, a $10,000 payment to Shehhi on 18 July from \\"Isam Mansur\\" and a $9,500 5 August payment from \\"Isam Mansour\\", gave Baluchi's PO Box number. On 8 August, Baluchi opened a bank account at Dubai Islamic Bank, using his name, passport and phone number. A $20,000 payment from Baluchi's bank account to Shehhi's Sun Trust account on 29 August gave a phone number one digit different than the one given by Isam Mansour on 5 August. A $70,000 payment was made to Shehhi's account by \\"Hani (Fawaz Trading)\\" on 17 September from the same exchange centre. Hani gave a telephone number one digit removed from the one Baluchi used on the transfer from his bank account on 29 August. In September, Hani Hanjour went to Dubai, where Baluchi gave him $3,000 to open a new bank account, and later deposited $5,000 in the account which Hanjour later accessed from ATMs in the United States. When Ahmed al-Ghamdi went to Dubai, Baluchi helped him purchase a cell phone. It is believed nine of the hijackers met with him in Dubai and received various levels of aid. The 9/11 Commission Report stated that he \\"relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were essentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the globe.\\" On 27 August 2001, Baluchi applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a week after his employer announced the closing of their Dubai branch, and the government had sent notices informing the employees their work permits had been rescinded and they had to leave the country. He was declined since he appeared to be an economic immigrant, and instead moved back home to Pakistan a few days before the attacks. = Post-9-11 = Moving back in with his parents in Karachi, Pakistan, Baluchi saw his uncle several times when he came to visit. According to a short biography written by the United States government's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), after the Taliban was initially driven from power after the 9/11 attack, al-Balouchi assisted KSM in organizing the movement of al-Qaeda operatives and their families to safehouses in Pakistan. * According to US government information, KSM had Balouchi be the \\"communications intermediary\\" between al-Qaeda and \\"shoe bombers\\" Richard Reid and Saajid Badat. In early 2002 Balouchi helped his uncle \\"prepare operatives\\" for travel from Pakistan to the United States, \\"ostensibly to carry out attacks\\". * Another plan was to hijack airliners and crash them into London's Heathrow airport, but * This plan was set aside in order to focus on a plan to bomb the US Consulate and other Western targets in Karachi.Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.252 * He also worked with his uncle to prepare Majid Khan and others for travel to the United States to conduct terrorist operations. * Balouchi reportedly sent Majid Khan to Thailand in late 2002 to deliver $50,000 to finance a plan by Jemaah Islamiya leader Hambali (Riduan Isamuddin) to attack US and Israeli targets in Southeast Asia. He later told investigators he helped his uncle arrange travel visas for people, but didn't know whether any of them were militants or not. In August 2002, the FBI questioned Abdul Samad Din Mohammed, the brother-in-law of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He reported that Baluchi was often in the company of his uncle, and would pick people up from the airport. His uncle KSM was arrested in Rawalpindi on March 1, 2003. Baluchi spent the next two months with Walid bin 'Attash. According to US reports, following his uncle's arrest Baluchi took charge of some of the new attacks being planned. Aafia Siddiqui, wife  Marriage  Baluchi also married Aafia Siddiqui. She was accused of being an al-Qaeda member and in February 2010 was convicted of assaulting with a deadly weapon and attempting to kill U.S. soldiers and FBI agents who were seeking to interrogate her while she was in custody, claimed to be married to Baluchi.Al-Qaeda Woman? Putting Aafia Siddiqui on Trial, TIME, 2010-01-18 The marriage was confirmed by Pakistani and US intelligence,The mystery of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, The Guardian, 2009-11-24 a defense psychologist, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's family.Mystery of Siddiqui disappearance, BBC, 2008-08-06 (Siddiqui's family denies she was married to Baluchi.) According to the FBI, after her arrest, Aafia Siddiqui told them that after she learned she was wanted by the US government she had gone into hiding around late March 2003 with the al-Baluchi clan. Divorced at the time, she stated she married Baluchi out of religious piety, since she \\"could not live in the same house with an unmarried male\\" (namely Baluchi) she married him. Their marriage was held in Hub Chowki outside of Karachi in the inner courtyard of Balouchi's house, with female al-Baluchi family members present.United States of America v. Aafia Siddiqui, Document 256, August 17, 2010, p.8 Siddiqui describes Balouchi as very kind to her, \\"a good man who is wrongly accused\\". (Siddiqui later repudiated all statements given to the FBI.)Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.245-6 The marriage lasted only a couple of months. According to one of KSM's uncles, Mohammed Hussein, Baluchi became alienated with Aafia's \\"liberal way of life\\". Aafia told the FBI that Baluchi divorced her after he was arrested.Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.253 Capture and treatment in US custody Siddiqui was arrested April 29, 2003 in Karachi along with al- Attash.Scroggins, Wanted Women, 2012: p.251 After his arrest al-Baluchi was kept in CIA custody at undisclosed locations until 6 September 2006 when he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba. In December 2005, Human Rights Watch listed him as a \\"ghost detainee\\" held in the CIA prison system.List of ‚ÄúGhost Prisoners‚Äù Possibly in CIA Custody, Human Rights Watch, December 1, 2005 During al-Baluchi's secret detention, he was tortured by the CIA using many so-called \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\". Officials reported: \\"al-Baluchi was tortured and forcibly dunked into a tub filled with ice water. CIA interrogators forcibly kept his head under water while he struggled to breathe and beat him repeatedly with a truncheon-like object hitting him and smashing his head against a wall.\\" Baluchi had a copy of a letter to Osama bin Laden from Saudi scholars in his pocket, a computer disk containing a draft of a letter to bin Laden, two images of the September 11 attacks, and a perfume bottle containing low-concentration cyanide used to bleach and perfume clothes. Baluchi was also accused of discussing the possibility of exporting explosives to the United States through textile companies, but claims to have no knowledge of what conversation is being referenced. The arrests led to the arrests of Jawad al-Bashar and Farzand Shah.CNN, Arrests amid Karachi terror plot, May 3, 2003 On 7 November 2003, a detainee was interrogated and said that Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh spoke briefly in August 2000 about a \\"Losh\\" who had asked Atta if he could travel to the United States to help with any potential plots, having already asked Mohammed three months earlier. Authorities allege this is a reference to Baluchi. ;Other plots to attack civilian targets According to US investigators, Baluchi told them that al-Qaeda had set up a biological weapons lab and he asked Aafia Siddiqui (who has a biology degree from MIT) advice on how long it would take to develop such weapons and whether the man in charge was capable of developing the weapons. Siddiqui replied that she \\"was willing to participate in a biological weapons (BW) project if al-Qaida tasked her to do so\\". Another plot involving Bauchi alleged by US investigators involved Heathrow airport. > According to Balochi's file, he told interrogators that he became aware of a > plan to attack Heathrow airport in January 2003 and had intended to seek > help from a more senior al-Qaida operative, Walid bin Attash, to carry it > out. An \\"analyst note\\" in the files notes that the plot called for \\"crashing > numerous airplanes into Heathrow, with a secondary explosion immediately > outside of the airport as a diversion\\". It collapsed after KSM was arrested > in March 2003. =Guantanamo Bay= On 6 September 2006, Baluchi was transferred from a black site location to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He was given the Internment Serial Number 10018 and is currently detained at a top-secret site at the Guantanamo base that allegedly houses approximately 15 \\"high-value\\" prisoners. Its location and the conditions inside are withheld from public knowledge and there are suspected grave human rights concerns regarding its conditions. Al- Baluchi's attorney James G. Connell, III visited him there in August 2013 under an order issued by the military commission. =CSRT= US District Court Justice Joyce Hens Green ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Department of Defense scheduled Tribunals for the 14 high-value captives who were transferred from covert CIA custody, on 6 September 2006, for early winter of 2007. The Summary of Evidence memo for Baluchi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal was drafted on 8 February 2007.Summary of Evidence (.pdf), prepared for Ammar al-Baluchi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal ‚Äì February 8, 2007 Baluchi cooperated with his tribunal. Although he was not able to call Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Saifullah Paracha or Ramzi bin al-Shibh to testify about his lack of connection to al- Qaeda, he was permitted to have his legal representative field statements they had made. He chose to put forward the statements by Mohammed and bin al-Shibh as evidence, but not the statement by Paracha.Summary of Evidence (.pdf), prepared for Ammar al-Baluchi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal Baluchi requested statements be garnered from Modern Electronics Corporation personnel, including Samir Sharin, Mohammed Mayer, Asraf Mayer, Ammar al- Tesqui and Sayed Tesqui that would testify he had no connections to militant forces, and that his employee records would show that he left several days before the attacks because his work permit had expired when MEC closed its Dubai branch. The tribunal judge ruled that although Baluchi's leaving Dubai a few days prior to the attacks was among the reasons for his capture, it was not relevant to seek records from his employer. Since the tribunal did not locate the individuals, Baluchi submit two statements he had written himself as what he believed his co-workers would say, and what he believed his Israeli roommates would say. In his defence, Baluchi argued that he often acted as a \\"businessman\\" to supplement his income, and thus his signature, telephone number and similar details were easily obtained in Dubai. He admitted dealing with Marwan al-Shehhi, but said that \\"when [he] approached me, he never declared himself as 'hijacker Marwan al Shehhi'. He approached me the same way he approached other individuals and companies in the U.S., a man wanting to do business\\". =First military commission= In February 2008, Baluchi was committed to a joint trial, charged with conspiracy, attacking civilians and civilian objects, causing serious bodily injury, murder, destruction of property, hijacking, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism.Human Rights Watch, Ali Abdul Aziz AliUnited States Department of Defense, 9/11 Co-Conspirators Charges Referred, May 13, 2008 Al Baluchi, Walid Bin Attash, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed chose to serve as their own attorney. They requested laptops, and internet access, in order to prepare their defences. In October 2008 Ralph Kohlmann ruled that the men be provided with the computers, but not the internet access. Al Baluchi's request said he was a Microsoft Certified software engineer. On 8 December 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after mental competency hearings for Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh. Mohammed said, \\"We want everyone to plead together.\\" =January 2009 Executive Order to Close Guantanamo= On 22 January 2009, United States President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13492, ordering a halt to the Guantanamo military commission as part of the overall closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. On 21 April 2009, United States Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell cited \\"Ali Abd al-Azeez Ali\\" as an example of the kind of captive United States President Barack Obama might free in the United States when he closes the camp in January 2010, because he didn't know what else to do with him. =Second military commission= In October 2011, in an operation called the \\"baseline review,\\" the prison seized all legal materials belonging to \\"high-value detainees,\\" starting with Abd al- Rahim al-Nashiri. The prison also announced that it would change its previous policy and begin reviewing legal mail for its content. In response, the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) ordered the attorneys under his supervision to stop sending privileged communications to Guantanamo prisoners. Under the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) policy, Al-Baluchi could not receive mail from his attorneys until November 2013. On 4 April 2012, the Department of Defense referred Guantanamo military commission charges against al Baluchi and four other men for participation in the conspiracy leading up to the September 11 attacks. On 5 May 2012, Military Judge James Pohl arraigned al Baluchi, and appointed attorneys to represent him. Hearing of 17 September 2019, considers the admissibility of clean team evidence During a preliminary hearing, held on 17 September 2019, the prosecution released a transcript from a conversation al-Baluchi had with another captive, when they were in two nearby recreation yards. It had not been known, until the release of this transcript, that the recreation yards contained hidden listening devices. According to an article by Carol Rosenberg, published in The New York Times, Camp Seven had at least two recreation yards. Captives got a whole recreation yard to themselves, during their outdoor recreation time. But they could hear other captives in nearby yards, and could communicate with them, by yelling. Prosecutors claimed the transcript's discussion of a confession al Baluchi was considering, drafted for him by fellow captive Ramzi bin al-Shibh, was evidence of al Baluchi's guilt. His defense attorney's argued that his willingness to consider a confession was an after effect of his years of torture. The purpose of the hearing was to help a new judge, W. Shane Cohen, make a decision as to whether confessions given to the \\"clean team\\" were still compromised by al Baluchi's torture. Zero Dark Thirty A fictionalized account of al-Baluchi's interrogation at black sites is depicted in the 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty. The character \\"Ammar\\" is portrayed by Reda Kateb. Al- Baluchi has complained that the United States has provided more information to the filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal about al-Baluchi's treatment in CIA custody than it has to Baluchi's own attorneys. The CIA acknowledged that the character \\"Ammar\\" is based on al-Baluchi. In the film, \\"Dan\\" the interrogator and other characters repeatedly describe \\"Ammar\\" as Mr. Mohammad's nephew. \\"Dan\\" also references the arrest of \\"Ammar\\" and describes his role as the financial facilitator in the 9/11 attacks. \\"The first 25 minutes of the movie are largely taken up with torture: Ammar is strung up, beaten, water boarded and kept awake for 96 hours straight.\\" References =Citations= = Books and journal articles = * External links *\\"Al Qaeda Agent's 9/11 Role Comes Into Focus\\", L.A.

Its roots date to 1954 in Chicago, Illinois. Latin Kings The Latin King street gang was formed in Humboldt Park in Chicago in the early 1950s. They saw themselves as a Latino progress movement to improve quality in immigrant families overcoming racial discrimination and founded the organization on the philosophy of \\"overcoming racial prejudice\\" and creating an organization of \\"Kings\\" and \\"Queens\\". They devolved, however, into a criminal enterprise operating throughout the United States. There are two umbrella factions: the Motherland, also known as KMC (King Manifesto and Constitution), and Bloodline (New York City). All members of the gang identify themselves as Latin Kings. = Motherland faction = Latin Kings associating with the Motherland faction also identify themselves as \\"Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN)\\"; they make up more than 160 structured chapters operating in 158 cities in 31 states. The membership in Chicago is estimated to be 20,000 to 35,000. = Bloodline faction = The Bloodline Manifesto was founded by Luis \\"King Blood\\" Felipe in 1986 in the New York State Collins Correctional Facility. Latin Kings associating with New York State Bloodline Chapter also identify themselves as the \\"Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (ALKQN)\\". Membership is estimated to be as many as 7,500, divided among several dozen Tribes operating in 15 cities in five states. New York State Bloodline Latin Kings share a common culture and structure with KMC and respect them as the Motherland, but not all chapters report to the Chicago leadership hierarchy. Organizational structure The Latin Kings have a hierarchical organizational structure. They have numerous \\"chapters\\" or \\"tribes\\" around the country which adhere to a regional, state, and national system. Officers are supported by a \\"Crown Council\\" of the 5 Crowns Council members. The Council sets rules and regulations and holds disciplinary hearings. The hierarchy rises to regional officers and ultimately to two supreme regional \\"Incas\\" based in Chicago. The heads of the entire criminal organization are known as \\"coronas\\". One retired detective said in 2004: \\"When you compare them to other street gangs like the Bloods and the Crips, none compare to the organization of the Latin Kings.\\" =Discipline= When any member believes that another member has violated a regulation, they begin the disciplinary process by submitting a Procedures for Violation Form. This form includes a variety of information about the allegation, including the violation, the statement of the accused, and members present or other witnesses. If the member is found to be guilty of the violation at their Crown hearing, they may be subject to a range of penalties depending on the severity of the offense: Non-Corporal Punishments * Probation ‚Äì for a period ranging between two weeks and two months, can be imposed in addition to other punishments * Fines (Multas) ‚Äì may also be used as a way to recoup the expense of gang property when it is destroyed or lost by a member * Stripping ‚Äì the member is stripped of rank and titles, unlikely to ever rise to the previous rank again * Suspension ‚Äì the member is stripped of all offices and duties, is not permitted to wear the colors, and is addressed as a novice * Community service ‚Äì particular assignments made on a case-by-case basis Corporal Punishments * B.O.S. (Beat on sight) ‚Äì beating of undetermined length of time * Three minute physical ‚Äì three-minute beating by at least three members * Five minute physical ‚Äì five-minute beating by five members * T.O.S. (Terminate on sight) ‚Äì death =Markings= The Latin King colors are black and gold. Gang markings consist of a five- or three-point \\"sacred crown\\", writings of LK, ALK, ALKN, ALKQN abbreviations (or the whole words), and drawings of the Lion or the King Master. Latin King symbolism is usually accompanied with the name and number of the Tribe, region, or city of the gang. The Latin Kings are members of the People Nation alliance of gangs, and are therefore opposed to the rival Folk Nation gang alliance. \\"Kingism\\" ideology L.A. Kaufman wrote in the February 2015 issue of New York Magazine that the Kings had a \\"unique mixture of intense discipline, revolutionary politics and a homemade religion called 'Kingism'\\". He suggests that this makes \\"a potent mixture for troubled ghetto kids whose lives lacked structure and hope.\\" Kingism is a blend of tribal gang rhetoric and religious mysticism. As one member put it, the Manifesto is \\"considered our Bible\\", and reading it is to go \\"from the darkness to the light\\". The Latin Kings operate under strict codes and guidelines that are conveyed in a lengthy constitution, and they follow the teachings of the King Manifesto. According to the Manifesto, there are three stages or cycles of Nation life that constitute Kingism: # The Primitive Stage: \\"That stage in life where the King warrior acts on impulse, executing his action without giving them the serious thought that they demand. A stage of immaturity where the King warrior's time is spent gang banging, getting high, and being recognized as big and bad.\\" # The Conservative Stage: \\"At this level the King warrior becomes tired of the primitive stage. He no longer wishes to participate in the senseless routine of gang fighting, hanging on the corner or being recognized as big and bad. Most often at this level the King warrior gets married and retires. It is inappropriate to call this stage maturity stage due to the fact that the King warrior at this time does not really become mature in the sense of maturity. Instead he becomes mummified or reaches a level of accepting life as it has been taught to him by the existing system that exploits all people of color-dehumanizes them and maintains them under the economic and social yoke of slavery.\\" # The New King Stage: \\"The stage of awareness and decision. The new King recognizes that the time for revolution is at hand. Revolution of the mind! The revolution of knowledge! A revolution that will bring freedom to the enslaved, to all Third World people as we together sing and praise with joy what time it is-it is Nation time! ... For him there are no horizons between races, sexes and senseless labels. for him everything has meaning, human life is placed above materialistic values ... When a man become a new King the will of the Nation becomes his will, for to be at variance with the Nation is one thing that cannot endure. The Almighty Latin King Nation requires wholehearted and complete devotion.\\"Brotherton, D (2013). The almighty Latin king and queen nation: Street politics and the transformation of a New York City gang. Columbia University Press According to the Manifesto, \\"The New King no longer views the rival warrior as the cause of his ills; instead, he fights against the Anti- King System (social injustices and inequality)\\". King Motherland Chicago Latin Kings Latin Kings sweater patch The Chicago faction of the Latin Kings is recognized as the largest Hispanic street gang in the United States and one of the largest Chicago-based street gangs. Their greatest membership is within the United States, unlike MS-13 and 18th Street gang, whose greatest membership exists in Central and South America. The gang has more than 25,000 members in the city of Chicago alone and has organized chapters in 41 states and several Latin American and European countries, including Mexico, Spain, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Canada, Italy, Puerto Rico, Portugal, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, United Kingdom, and others. Bloodline Latin Kings The Bloodline Latin Kings are a faction of the Latin Kings headquartered in New York. =Leadership= In the early 1980s, to avoid imprisonment for his criminal activities in Chicago, Luis Felipe (a.k.a. King Blood) fled to New York. Soon after arriving in New York Felipe was arrested and convicted of murdering his girlfriend. In 1986, while in prison, Felipe started his own chapter of the Latin Kings known as the Bloodline. He designated himself as Inca and Supreme Crown of the state of New York. In 1995 Antonio Fernandez (a.k.a. King Tone) was designated Inca and Supreme Crown of New York State and New Jersey, and the ALKQN once again began a transformation. =Street gang: 1986‚Äì1995= From 1986 to the internal power struggle that erupted in 1994, the ALKQN solidified its role as a gang through crimes such as murder, racketeering, and RICO Act charges. In 1991, Felipe was returned to prison after a short release for parole violations stemming from the receipt of stolen goods. However, Felipe continued to guide the ALKQN members, who now numbered about 2,000, both incarcerated and free. In 1994, with the rapid growth of the Latin Kings, an internal power struggle erupted and violence within the Kings ensued. Between June 1993 and February 1994, seven Latin Kings were murdered. Following the outbreaks of internal gang violence, Luis Felipe and 19 others were charged with murder and racketeering; the indictments ended in 1995 with 39 Latin Kings and 1 Latin Queen indicted under the RICO Act.https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc- xpm-1997-08-19-9708190347-story.html The details of the charges against Felipe were later revealed: Felipe was charged with ordering the killing of William (Lil Man) Cartagena. Cartegena was taken to an abandoned Bronx apartment where he was strangled, decapitated, mutilated and his corpse set on fire. Although Felipe was in prison, the government later alleged he had ordered a TOS (\\"Terminate On Sight\\") to all Latin Kings for the murder of Cartagena. This letter and many others were how Felipe was initially linked to three murders on the streets of New York; testimony from former Kings was used as further evidence of the orders. The letters had been copied and stored by the NY Department of Corrections, who were not aware of the significance of the letters until a federal task force was formed that included NYPD homicide investigators, FBI agents, and DOC investigators. =Reformation: 1996‚Äì1999= In 1996, following the trial of Luis Felipe, Antonio Fernandez, who was recently blessed as the Inca and Supreme Crown of New York State kneeled with other Latin Kings in front of the Federal District Court in Manhattan and is quoted as stating, \\"It's time for a fresh start ... Now they can't hold our past against us.\\" 1996 is believed to be the beginning of the ALKQN's transformation from a street gang to a \\"street organization.\\" Latin Kings and Queens began appearing en masse at political demonstrations in support of the Latino community. To further its transformation and efforts to legitimize, the organization began to hold its monthly meetings (universals) at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in West Harlem. At this time, the membership of the Latin Kings is believed to have swelled to 3,000 incarcerated and 4,000 free. The monthly universals drew attendance of 500‚Äì600 regularly. Internal changes to the organization began to take place as Fernandez amended the ALKQN manifesto to include parliamentary elections and new procedures for handling inter- organizational grievances and removing death as a possible punishment, replacing it with \\"vanishing\\", the act of being banished from the movement. For the ALKQN, 1997 began with Felipe being sentenced to the harshest penalty passed down since World War II. Felipe was sentenced to 250 years in prison, the first 45 to be spent in solitary confinement. He was a close friend of criminal (YACS) member Pavle Stanimirovic writes about it as he witnessed this brutality in Solitary confinement. The other 39 members were sentenced to an average of 20 years in prison for their roles in the crimes. The year would bring further legal troubles as Fernandez and 31 others are arrested in a raid in the Lower East Side and charged with disorderly conduct. The Special Commissioner of Investigation for Schools soon after charges the ALKQN with infiltrating the school system; a school security guard with five years of service was dismissed on charges of unprofessional conduct for his association with the Latin Kings. The year came to a close with Fernandez being arrested in December by the FBI for domestic abuse. The pending charges against Fernandez were dropped in early 1998. Following the release of Fernandez, a joint operation of the FBI, New York City Police Department (NYPD), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), New York State Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) comes to a close with the arrests of 92 suspected ALKQN members. The Latin King leadership insists over half of those arrested are not members. The operation, dubbed Operation Crown, cost the city over one million dollars and took 19 months to complete. Fernandez was released after four days on $350,000 bail, which was paid for by contributions from community members must mandatory pay their dues collected every week that goes into the \\"Caja\\" Box that the treasurer would be in charge of collecting. Over half of the arrested were charged with misdemeanors, other were charged with weapons possession and drug trafficking. Fernandez was eventually permitted, though on house arrest, to attend monthly universal meetings. It was during his time on house arrest that the Latin Queens underwent a shake up in leadership, dismissing many of the leaders in order to bring in more politically focused members. The Latin Kings during this period begin to gain legitimacy. First, Lolita Lebr√≥n, who was a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, appointed the New York State ALKQN to protect her during a demonstration in front of the United Nations. Following the U.N. demonstration, Rafael Cancel-Miranda, a Puerto Rican nacionalista who spent 25 years in federal prison, attended a monthly universal. Before years' end, Adelfa Vera, Puerto Rican activist, attended a monthly universal and was given sacred ALKQN beads by the present leadership. Adelfa was praised during the meeting and stated \\"These kids are hope for our liberation struggle. I can die in peace, because we found the continuation.\\" In 1998, Fernandez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell and distribute heroin. In 1999, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which he began serving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Kansas and was placed in solitary confinement. He was eventually transferred again and placed in general population. He has since been released.  Massachusetts  Operation Dethrone was an investigation by the Western Massachusetts Gang Task Force, consisting of the FBI, the Chicopee Police Department, the Hampden County Sheriff's Department, the Holyoke Police Department, the Massachusetts State Police, the Springfield Police Department, and the West Springfield Police Department. The first phase of the investigation, went after the Lawrence chapter of the ALKQN, was converted to an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force/High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area case involving numerous federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. After the significant disruption of the Lawrence chapter in February 2004, information provided by cooperating defendants led to the significant disruption of the Springfield chapter in June 2005. 57 ALKQN members have been indicted. On December 6, 2019 more than 45 Latin King (suspected) members, including its leader Michael Cecchetelli, were arrested by the FBI and other state and local agencies, in Massachusetts.https://www.boston25news.com/news/fbi-dozens-of-alleged-latin- kings-gang-members-charged-with-racketeering-drug- trafficking/1015679694https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/over-60-members- latin-kings-charged Spain The Latin Kings in Spain were founded in Madrid in February 2002 by Ecuadorian national Eric Javier Vara Velastegui. Branches then followed in Barcelona, Valencia and Murcia. Membership is predominantly Ecuadorian, although other Latin American and Spanish youths have also been recruited. According to a report by the Madrid government commission, there are approximately one-hundred active members and six-hundred associates in the city. In Spain, the √ëetas are the main rivals of the Latin Kings.Spanish gangs: the royal, racketeering 'Latin Kings' Thibault Blin, caf√©babel (28 January 2009) Such Latin American gangs spread to Spain as a result of mass deportations from the United States of Latin American immigrants with criminal records.SPAIN: Latin Kings Gang a ‚ÄúCultural Association‚Äù in Barcelona Tito Drago, Inter Press Service (21 September 2006) The Latin Kings were registered as a cultural association in Catalonia in September 2006.

The Latin Queens constituted the female Queen Anubis and Queen Maat of the ALKQN. The Latin Queen agenda is composed of self- respect, independence, family support, ethnic identity and self-empowerment. Seeking such goals has attracted a wide variety of females who had been drug addicted, victimized and/or neglected by families, spouses and partners. Sociologists studying the Latin Kings and Queens have observed the different methods in which both groups attempt to \\"reclaim and regulate\\" their environments. The Latin Queens are believed to focus more on their private space issues such as home life and protection and nurturing of their bodies, as opposed to the Latin Kings, who are more concerned with loss of public spaces in their own communities. The evolution of the ALKQN has been viewed by outside sources as being assisted by the addition and greater role in which Queen Loki and Queen Vailor have played, exposing the ALKQN to a greater range of cross-class supporters than would have been possible prior to their integration. In countries such as Spain, Latin Queens are helping to legitimize the ALKQN through integration with government sponsored programs.

In 1808 a lighthouse was constructed at the site to guide ships through the Quoddy Narrows. The current tower, with distinctive red-and-white stripes, was constructed in 1858 and is an active aid to navigation. The 3rd order Fresnel lens is the only 3rd order and one of only eight Fresnel lenses still in use on the Maine Coast. The light station was added to the National Register of Historic Places as West Quoddy Head Light Station on July 4, 1980. Description West Quoddy Head is an easterly-pointing peninsula in southeastern Lubec, overlooking Quoddy Narrows, a strait between Lubec and Campobello Island, Canada, that provides access to Passamaquoddy Bay and harbors located on the St. Croix River and other rivers which the empty into the bay. Most of the peninsula is part of Quoddy Head State Park, and the light station is located near the southern end of its eastern face A stone sign describes the lighthouse as the \\"easternmost point in the U.S.A.\\" It is the easternmost building in the United States (a nearby sign proclaims the \\"easternmost giftshop in the U.S.\\"), but the easternmost point is at rocks extending eastward from the shore. The present light station includes a tower, former keeper's quarters, service building, and oil house. The tower is circular, and is in height, with the beacon at above sea level. The light, magnified by a third-order Fresnel lens, has a range of . The tower is built of brick, and painted in alternating horizontal red and white stripes. A small gabled entry vestibule, also brick, projects from the tower. The keeper's house is a wood frame structure, 1 stories in height. History A lighthouse at West Passamaquoddy Head, Maine, was authorized by Congress in 1806. The light station was finished on April 21, 1808, at a cost of $5,000 (). In 1820, Congress authorized the first fog signal at the station, a bell, for a cost of $1,000 (). The current tower was built in 1858. The present station was built in 1858. The former keeper's house now serves as a museum and visitor's center. In 1990, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 25-cent stamp featuring the West Quoddy Head Light. Keepers * The first keeper was Thomas Dexter. *1939: Howard Grey was the last civilian keeper of the station prior to its transfer to the U.S. Coast Guard. *1962: As of August 15, 1962, BM1 Bruce Keene was OIC, or Officer-in-Charge (dates of the time he began and ended his tour are not known-- he served at least through September 1964.) According to documents in the West Quoddy file, his father, LT Thomas Keene, had previously served as the head keeper of the light station. *1963: As of October 27, Keene was still OIC and (Engineman?)

In service on the daily Rotterdam to London route, after the invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940 the ship was chartered by the British Ministry of War Transport and was sent to Guernsey to evacuate children in anticipation of the German occupation of the Channel Islands. In June she was transferred to the Royal Navy, and commissioned in September 1940 as HMS Eastern Isles, being renamed HMS Western Isles in March 1941. She served as the flagship of Western Approaches Command's Anti-Submarine Training School at Tobermory where from about July 1940 all escort ships intended for Atlantic convoy duty attended before being allowed to deploy. A noted depiction of the establishment and its commander is given (albeit in fictional form) in Nicholas Monsarrat's novel The Cruel Sea. The Training School was closed following the end of World War II in Europe. In 1946 HMS Western Isles was sold to the Koninklijke Marine (\\"Royal Netherlands Navy\\"). She was converted into a submarine warfare training ship and renamed HNLMS Zeearend (A 892). She was finally decommissioned in October 1970, struck from the Navy List in July 1971, and sold for scrapping in November 1972.

Supported by the Learning and Skills Council and other sector bodies, the NLN provided network infrastructure and a wide-ranging programme of support, information and training, as well as the NLN Materials ‚àí a substantial range of e-learning content. The initiative began in 1999 with the aim of helping to transform post-16 education. The Government's total investment in the NLN totalled ¬£156 million over a five-year period. Although the network itself is no longer operational, the main output of the initiative ‚àí the NLN Materials ‚àí continue to represent one of the most substantial and wide-ranging collections of e-learning materials in the UK. Available free to the post-16 sector, they are still actively promoted and updated.  History  The seeds for the UK's National Learning Network (NLN) were sown in the spring of 1999 through the collaboration of the Further Education Funding Council for England (FEFC), the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and agencies like Becta, NILTA, FEDA and Jisc. This government-funded project resulted in three main developments: * The Joint Information Services Committee (JISC) that had been managing the Joint Academic Network (JANET) on behalf of UK Universities and Research Councils would now be part-funded by the Further Education Funding Council. Consequently, all UK Colleges of Further Education would be connected to the JANET network and benefit from the data sets and learning resources available through it. * Support for the newly connected colleges would be provided by the JISC Regional Support Centres (RSC), set up by university and college partnerships to cover all FEFC funding areas. The RSCs' initial brief was to manage the connection of FE colleges to the JANET network, train local IT staff and provide high level technical support. * A massive programme of learning materials development would be set up under the name of National Learning Network (NLN) to enable Further Education and the Adult and Community Learning (ACL) sectors to make best use of JANET and the enhanced ICT resources that these sectors enjoyed. A substantial body of work was developed by colleges, universities and commercial organisations and were made available to all qualifying parties. NLN has played a significant role in the adoption of Information and Learning Technology (ILT) by the post-16 education sectors in the UK.  NLN Materials  Four rounds of interactive learning materials were commissioned and authored under the NLN banner, covering a wide range of academic and vocational topics. The last body of work ‚àí Round 4, adding to the 800 hours of materials already available, was aimed at the Adult and Community Learning sector, covering four main topics: Family Learning, English for Speakers of Other Languages, Learning to Learn, and Making Learning Work for You. These materials were made available from winter 2005. Round 1 and 2 of the materials were substantially updated during April to July 2006. The materials are designed to be used in a variety of formats and delivery platforms, including within a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). To facilitate this, all NLN materials have been packaged as Scorm Learning Objects, with metadata. Most of the LOs can be disaggregated into multiple Shareable Content Objects, and to varying degrees modified and repurposed by practitioners. In total, the NLN Materials consist of 2251 Learning Objects, 800 hours of learning, and have been used in around a third of UK FE institutions, as well as commercial and offender learning contexts. Xtensis ltd. originally took a consultancy role in the project, gradually increasing their role to hosting the materials to practitioners in the ACL sector, then to all sectors, also introducing a download format that includes a navigational wrapper allowing the materials to be distributed and used on CD/DVD/intranet, while still being valid Scorm Content Packages. Although most of the institutions involved in their creation have since been disbanded, the materials are still well used. Since 2015, authority of the NLN Materials service has passed to the Education and Training Foundation, with the materials hosted within Xtensis's social bookmarking site XtLearn.net which still allows direct access and independent download, but also enables mixing with other content sources from around the web into content collections.

Historic disputes regarding the 17th Karmapa controversy are the focus of numerous accounts, reports, journalism articles, and are also the subject of several books that typically support one or the other candidate. Despite an intriguing history, the high lamas involved are meeting with each other on good terms and issuing statements that they are confident there will be an amicable solution. Background =Conflicts with previous Karmapa recognitions= The recognition of the Karmapa incarnations are of central importance in the Karma Kagyu lineage. The 8th, 10th, and 12th incarnations, as well as the widely renowned 16th Karmapa, experienced minor conflicts during their recognitions, each of which was ultimately resolved. =Prophesy by the Karmapa 500 years earlier= Possibly referring to the controversy, the prophesy is described as: > [A] Karmapa 500 years ago warned not only of the domination of Tibet by > powerful neighbours, but of a problem regarding the succession of Karmapas > stemming from an insider who will wreak havoc \\"by the power of his twisted > aspirations.\\" =Re-emergence of the Shamar Rinpoche= In 1964, an eight-year-old Shamar Rinpoche, who was the nephew of the 16th Karmapa and traveled alongside him during his escape to Bhutan from Tibet, was officially recognized by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government following its 172-year ban on recognizing Sharmapa reincarnations. The ban began after the 10th Sharmapa was accused of being a traitor and of instigating the Sino-Nepalese War between Tibet and Nepal, according to members of the Karma Kagyu lineage. The ban effected Shamar Rinpoche's lineage and supporting administration, but his enthronement in 1964 at the Rumtek Monastery allowed him back into his historical position as the second ranking lama of the Karma Kagyu lineage, following the 16th Karmapa. Incarnations like the 12th Sharmapa, son of the 15th Karmapa, enjoyed more leniency‚Äîbut not official recognition‚Äîfrom the government thanks to the close personal relationship of the Karmapa and the 13th Dalai Lama. =Collaboration to recognize a Karmapa incarnation= The Karmapas traditionally predict their conscious rebirths, and prepare their predictions for their closest students so as to be located after birth. Although not strictly defined, the usual process to locate, recognize and enthrone a Karmapa incarnation was facilitated quietly by those previously close students and collaboratively and behind closed doors. Multiple judgements ensured harmony and continuity of the lineage. Among the collaborative participants, the Shamar Rinpoches have played an important role in confirming the identity of the Karmapas for several centuries. The Tai Situ Rinpoches and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoches have played similar roles, as the circumstances dictated. Role of the Sharmapa Rinpoches The Shamar Rinpoches have had a hand in recognizing seven of the Karmapas and were often successors and teachers of the Karmapas‚Äîthe relationship between the two has been characterized as being like father and son or as brothers. The 5th Dalai Lama, for instance, affirmed the Karmapa and Sharmapa incarnations as having equal status, and in early texts the Shamarpa referred to as the \\"Red Hat Karmapa\\".Autobiography of the Fifth Dalai Lama. 3 vols. Lhasa: bod ljongs mi dmangs dpe skrun khang, 1989, Vol. 2. P.359, cit. in: Upon his enthronement in 1964 the 14th Sharmapa was named by 16th Karmapa as his spiritual heir and was the senior-most lama of the lineage during the controversy, but not the lead regent for identifying the reincarnation. That role was given to Jamgon Kongtrul. Role of Tai Situ Rinpoches and Gyaltsap Rinpoches The Tai Situ Rinpoches and Gyaltsap Rinpoches have also had a close historical relationship with the Karmapas. The Tai Situ Rinpoches have identified‚Äîeither independently or in conjunction with the Shamar or Gyaltsap rinpoches‚Äîfour of the Karmapa incarnations, and similarly the Gyaltsap rinpoches have helped identify five incarnations (both include recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje). =Chokgyur Lingpa's Prophecy of 17th Karmapa and Tai Situ Rinpoche= A prophesy was made by the 19th century Nyingma master, Chokgyur Lingpa, based a vision he had whereby Guru Rinpoche manifests as past and future Karmapas, and the minds of the 17th Karmapa and Tai Situ Rinpoche are \\"inseparably one\\" as they sit together under a \\"verdant tree on a Rocky mountain\\". Corresponding to the prophesy, the 12th Tai Situ Rinpoche was entrusted with the 16th Karmapa's prediction letter, headed the collaborative recognition process after Jamgon Kongtrul's mysterious car crash in 1992, and dispatched the search team which located Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa.Enlightened Heart, Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle, (24 March 1999), https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu- Buddhists-face-a-leadership-battle/ While disputing the interpretation of the prophesy, the Sharmapa, while supporting his selection of Trinley Thaye Dorje maintained it could be reinterpreted to correspond to the 16th Karmapa and the 11th Tai Situ Rinpoche. =The 14th Dalai Lama= In Tibet, historically the 14th Dalai Lama's Gelug school had a strong political and spiritual leadership role, which was tempered by the autonomy of the three other schools of Tibetan Buddhism - the Kagyu school, the Nyingma school and the Sakya school. The Nyingma school has always been non-political. The 13th Dalai Lama sought to modernize the political state, and the young 14th Dalai Lama interacted with the Communist political system after 1949, then attempted peace talks while accompanied by the Panchen Lama and others in 1955. After China's invasion turned brutal in 1959 and his incarnation was threatened, he went into exile and repudiated all agreements with China.His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet, Chronology of Events, https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/events- and-awards/chronology-of-events In 1963, the Tibetan government in exile introduced democratic reforms, and in 2011 the Dalai Lama resigned from his political position to continue as a spiritual leader. During this period in 1992, after Ogyen Trinley Dorje was located and recognized, the search committee then led by Tai Situ Rinpoche requested the Dalai Lama to bestow the Buktham Rinpoche seal, or the Buktham Letter, on the recognized 17th Gyalwang Karmapa. The spiritual seal was made official on 30 June 1992, granted due to his \\"universally respected standing as a spiritual master\\" and through his \\"advanced level of spiritual development and his impeccable ethical integrity\\". Supporters of Ogyen Trinley Dorje maintain that the 14th Dalai Lama has the spiritual authority to recognize an incarnation of the Karmapa. Supporters of Trinley Thaye Dorje claim any previous involvement of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan government was merely a final stamp of approval following an individual monastery's (or lama's administration) independent decision. Chinese attempts to control incarnations Within the Antireligious campaigns in China is an ongoing directive to halt the recognition of high tulkus and control the naming of Dalai Lamas, Panchen Lamas, Karmapas, and Sharmapas, in order to gain spiritual and temporal control of Tibet and of Tibetan Buddhism. Official Beijing decrees were initiated in 1991, then revised as the State Religious Affairs Bureau Order No. 5 to outlaw the recognition of tulkus and lamas without China's state approvals. An ineffective lottery system was reported following the ban of the Sharmapas. In 1992, China tried another tactic which approved the 17th Karmapa's enthronement and posited its plan to eventually replace the 14th Dalai Lama with the 17th Karmapa. In 1999, the Karmapa escaped from Tibet and the direct control by authorities, after the 11th Panchen Lama was kidnapped by Chinese authorities. Corruption of the Tibetan tulku system In the centuries following the inception of the system used to identify reincarnate lamas (beginning in the 13th century with the second Karmapa) the process became increasingly corrupted and politicized by those living outside of monastic ordination systems, as the process also led indirectly to sources of ordinary wealth and power in Tibet. Highly-recognized teachers like the Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche have bemoaned the practice as belonging to feudal times and advocated revamping the system in way that divorces the reincarnate teacher from administrative politics and allows them to distinguish themselves. Karmapa controversy history The history of the Karmapa controversy has primarily revolved around the 14th Shamar Rinpoche. A regent's collaborative team based at Rumtek Monastery, which located Ogyen Trinley Dorje, was led by the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, and included the Sharmapa, the 12th Tai Situpa whom was given the prediction letter by the 16th Karmapa, and the 12th Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche. Aid was also given by the 14th Dalai Lama and by his prophetic dream. After the prediction letter was reviewed by the four regents on 19 March 1992, Jamgon Kongtrul was elected to lead the search team. After his mysterious car accident on 26 April, Tai Situ led the search team and the Sharmapa left Rumtek Monastery and Jamgon Kongtrul's traditional cremation ceremony for the United States.Enlightened Heart, Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle, (24 March 1999), https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists-face-a- leadership-battle/ After his return, the Sharmapa broke away from the regents immediately following the announcement of the recognition of the Karmapa at Rumtek Monastery on 12 June 1992. The semi-public divisiveness then began. At that point, no other people had been presented by the Sharmapa, and five days later the Sharmapa approved Ogyen Trinley Dorje. The enthronement followed on 27 September at Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet, after the Buktham Letter from the Dalai Lama was signed on 30 June. The date at which the Sharmapa announced his preferred Karmapa is unclear. His separate process he maintains began in 1986, but without traditional announcements and immediate enthronement. The Sharmapa's cousin Topga Yugyal was reported as involved, as is a person the Sharmapa refused to name in 1994 that might be the same source for the secret interview of Trinley Thaye Dorje. Two other lamas eventually helped Trinley Thaye Dorje to arrive in India for his enthronement in 1994. =Passing of the 16th Karmapa and first rebirth omens= Soon after the parinirvana of the 16th Karmapa in 1981, there were omens that the search for the 17th Karmapa would be difficult. A disagreement began brewing when four regents, led by the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, recounted apposing stories on what direction, and at whose feet, relics landed from the 16th Karmapa's funeral pyre.Curren, Erik, \\"Buddha's Not Smiling: Uncovering Corruption at the Heart of Tibetan Buddhism Today\\" 2006 p. 60 Years passed with no obvious clues of where to find the next incarnation, and the controversy came to the forefront when Shamar Rinpoche broke from the group of regents, claiming Tai Situ Rinpoche was not following protocol.Lehnert, Tomek (1998). Rogues in Robes: An Inside Chronicle of a Recent Chinese-Tibetan Intrigue in the Karma Kagyu Lineage of Diamond Way Buddhism. Blue Dolphin Publishing. pp. 157-158. . =Initial search committee= 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul 14th Kunzig Shamarpa 12th Tai Situpa Following the parinirvana of the 16th Karmapa in 1981, a regency of the four highest remaining members of the Karma Kagyu lineage at that time was formed to locate his rebirth: *The 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul - lead regent, third-ranking spiritual leader *The 14th Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche - second-ranking spiritual leader *The 12th Tai Situpa - fourth-ranking spiritual leader *The 12th Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche - fifth-ranking spiritual leader This regency was officially dissolved by 1984, but the four Rinpoches still referred to themselves as \\"regents\\" when the prediction letter was interpreted in 1992. As the collaborative group, they had the authority to recognize the next Karmapa. As years went by, the pressure to find the next incarnation of the Karmapa mounted. =Discovery of each candidate= Prediction letter and recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje One central piece of evidence in the recognition of the 17th Karmapa is a prediction letter written by the 16th Karmapa that indicated the parents, location and year of his rebirth. The prediction letter located Ogyen Trinley Dorje and his family. The Sharmapa originally doubted its authenticity, but in June 1992The Sharmapa's written statement, witnessed by Orgyen Tulku Rinpoche, (17 June 1992), translated by Michelle Martin; The Sharmapa's written statement, witnessed by Tulku Urgyen, (18 July 1992), translated by Anne Ekselius, https://kagyuoffice.org/confirmation-by-the-dalai-lama/sharmar-rinpoche- letter/ he recinded his request for authenticity tests. By July 1992, the Sharmapa again stated his support for the Dalai Lama's process, which recognized Ogyen Trinley Dorje.Enlightened Heart, Tibet's Kagyu Buddhists face a leadership battle, (24 March 1999), https://www.karmapa.org.nz/news/15/64/Tibet-s-Kagyu-Buddhists-face-a- leadership-battle/ In January 1981, nine months before the 16th Karmapa's parinirvana, the 12th Tai Situpa maintains that the Karmapa gave him an amulet with a yellow brocade cover, telling him, \\"This is your protection amulet. In the future, it will confer great benefit.\\" Although Tai Situpa wore the locket on a gold chain for about a year after the Karmapa's death, he moved it to a side pocket, not realizing its significance or that it contained a message. Tai Situpa states that he followed an intuition to open the amulet and found in late 1990 the third prediction letter, inside an envelope marked \\"Open in the Metal Horse Year\\". It reads: > Oh Marvel! Self-realization is continual bliss. The dharmadhatu has neither > center nor periphery. To the north of here, in the east [of the Land] of > Snow [1], Lies the country where Divine thunder spontaneously blazes [2]. In > a beautiful place of nomads [marked] by the sign of \\"that which fulfills all > desires\\" [3], The method is D√∂ndrup and the wisdom is Lolaga [4]. [Born] the > year of the one used for the earth [5] With the miraculous and far-reaching > sound of the white one [6], He is the one known as the Karmapa. Sustained by > the lord D√∂ny√∂ Drubpa [7], Impartial, he fathoms all directions. Neither > close to some, nor distant from others, he is the protector of all beings: > The sun of the Buddha's Dharma that benefits others blazes continually. In translating the letter, Lama Kunsang, Lama Pemo, and Marie Aubele state: \\"The numbered lines can be interpreted as follows: *1.) \\"Ogyen Trinley Dorje was born in Kham, a region of Eastern Tibet *2.) \\"The Last Testament uses the term \\"Nam Chak,\\" \\"Heavenly Iron\\"; the place of birth of the Karmapa is called \\"Lhathok,\\" \\"Divine Thunder.\\" *3.) \\"That which fulfills all desires \\"refers to the \\"cow that fulfills all desires,\\" a term found in Buddhist texts; the name of the nomadic community where the child was born is \\"Bagor,\\" and \\"Ba\\" means \\"cow.\\" *4.) \\"Here, the sixteenth Karmapa indicates very clearly the names of his future parents. In Buddhist texts, method and wisdom refer to the masculine and feminine principles, respectively. *5.) \\"The ox is habitually used to work the land: the year of the birth of the Karmapa was that of the Wood Ox [1995]. *6.) \\"This refers to the sound of the conch that, soon after the birth of the Karmapa, resounded miraculously in the sky. *7.) \\"D√∂ny√∂ Drubpa (Skt. Amoghasiddhi) is one of the five dhyanibuddhas, who represents the family of activity, karma. D√∂ny√∂ refers to the twelfth Tai Situpa, whose name is Pema D√∂ny√∂ Nyinje, indicating that he will become the root lama of the seventeenth Karmapa.\\" When the letter was interpreted at the 19 March 1992 meeting of the council of the four regents, was taken to mean that he would be reborn in a specific valley in eastern Tibet. A few days after 18 May 1992, and one month before his seventh birthday, Apo Gaga, known as Ogyen Trinley Dorje, was met by a group of monks from Tsurphu Monastery which his brother happened to lead to their tent where their nomadic family lived, near Bagor, Lhathok, in Eastern Tibet. Apo Gaga had claimed for years that he was the Karmapa. According to the Kagyu official website: > After consideration of the evidence, and additional meetings with Their > Eminences Tai Situ Rinpoche, Tsurphu Gyaltsab Rinpoche and Shamar Rinpoche, > His Holiness the Dalai Lama granted the Buktham Rinpoche, the official > notification of the Dalai Lama's approval of the identity of His Holiness > the Seventeenth Karmapa. On 27 September 1992, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was formally enthroned at Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet, the traditional seat of the Karmapas, in a ceremony attended by 20,000 people. He lived in Tsurphu another seven years. In late 1999, 14-year-old Ogyen Trinley Dorje decided that the restrictions placed on him by the PRC government at Tsurphu limited his ability to teach his disciples and receive teachings from lineage masters. He made a daring escape over the Himalayas in the middle of winter, evading Chinese authorities and making his way through Nepal and on to Dharamsala, India, arriving on January 5, 2000.Luke Harding, Daring escape of the Karmapa, (28 April 2001), The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/28/lukeharding Discovery and recognition of Trinley Thaye Dorje  In October 1986 Chobgye Tri Rinpoche, senior Sakya master and head of one of the three Sakya lineages, contacted the Shamarpa and informed him about a dream he had had and about a relative of his from Lhasa who brought a picture of a child who reportedly and repeatedly announced that he was the Karmapa. In 1988 Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche was sent to obtain more information about the child. Later an unnamed lama was sent to meet with the family and the boy without revealing the real purpose of his visit. Upon meeting with the emissary the boy promptly said \\"You were sent here for me.\\" This along with other evidence convinced the Shamarpa that the boy was indeed the reincarnation of the late 16th Karmapa. In March 1994, Thaye Dorje escaped with his family from Tibet and traveled to New Delhi where he was formally recognized during a welcoming ceremony. He took monastic ordination from Chobgye Tri Rinpoche and is at present undergoing a very intensive education under the guidance of Shamar Rinpoche, also studying under teachers such as Prof. Sempa Dorje, Khenpo Ch√∂drak Rinpoche and others. Fluent in English, he also travels extensively in the East and the West to give lectures.

Your putting forward a second Karmapa can only cause, for now in the future, discord and the breaking of samaya within the lineage. So please on no account consider implementing such activities.\\" Recognizing the current Karmapa An academic expert, Geoffrey Samuel, in the field testified in court, while the recognition of Ogyen Trinley \\"appears to have been accepted by a majority of Karma Kagyu monasteries and lamas, there remains a substantial minority of monasteries and lamas who have not accepted Ogyen Trinley as Karmapa. In particular, these include the Shamar Rinpoche, who historically has been the person most directly involved in the process of recognition.\\"https://karmapaissue.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/affirm-geoffrey-samuel.pdf It is difficult to produce an objective description of the events. Among the major tulkus of the Karma Kagyu lineage, which includes the 7th Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, the 9th Thrangu Rinpoche, the 7th Mingyur Rinpoche, and the 9th Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, they hold Ogyen Trinley Dorje to be the 17th Karmapa, while the majority of lamas and Karma Kagyu sangha also agree. Trinley Thaye Dorje has been recognized by Shamar Rinpoche, Lama Jigme Rinpoche, Topga Yulgyal Rinpoche, Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche, Sherab Gyaltsen Rinpoche, the Venerable Khenchen Rinpoche Drupon Trinley Paljor, and the Fourth Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche. The government of the People's Republic of China officially recognized Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa in 1992.KARMAPA LAMA - China Facts and Details The People's Republic of China has continued to recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the Karmapa even after he departed Tibet and arrived in India in January of 2000. The Beru Khyentse Rinpoche holds a distinct minority view, saying he believes both Karmapas are legitimate.Letter to International Dharma Community Nov 03 - Kagyu Rime Dharjay Choling He states \\"it is possible that there can be two Karmapas in order to benefit sentient beings because the Karmapa can manifest in many different forms\\" and writes that the 14th Karmapa highlighted that \\"in many universes a hundred million Karmapas have manifested. The Karmapa is also the Buddha's emanation, thus until all the thousand Buddhas have come and their doctrine is not diminishing, my activity of the Karmapa emanations will not end.\\" Ch√∂kyi Nyima Rinpoche said that \\"as far as my father (Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche) was concerned, they were both to be respected and perceived with pure appreciation.\\" Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche also witnessed the Sharmapa's 1992 statements that accepted Ogyen Trinley Dorje as the 17th Karmapa, and accepted the Dalai Lama's recognition. Recent developments =Court battle over Rumtek Monastery in 1998= Rumtek Monastery Control of Rumtek Monastery, which was the seat of the 16th Karmapa in exile, has been the subject of a legal contest filed in 1998 \\"by the Karmapa Charitable Trust, [and the plaintiffs] Shri T.S. Gyaltshen, Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche, and Shri Gyan Jyoti Kansakar against the State of Sikkim, The Secretary of Ecclessiastical Affairs and Goshir Gyaltsab Rinpoche. The plaintiffs seek to evict the monks and other occupants of Dhama Chakra Centre, Rumtek and to possess and administer the monastery for their own purposes.\\"Kagyu Office, https://kagyuoffice.org/official-releases/the-supreme-court-of-india-decision-regarding-litigation-in-sikkim-district-court/ Previously in 1982, Shamar Rinpoche and his cousin Topga Yugyal gained control of the estate at Rumtek monastery a month after the 16th Karmapa's passing. Three monasteries in Bhutan were sold, and control was gained over the Karmapa Charitable Trust, organized in 1961 by the 16th Karmapa. Disagreements over the Sharmapa's and Topga's financial dealings began in 1988. Ogyen Trinley Dorje's followers maintain that the trust was solely established for the sake of seeing to the welfare of the Karmapa's followers, providing funds for the maintenance of the monastery, and for the monks' medical fees. The administration of the monastery was the responsibility of the Tsurphu Labrang, which was organized as a legal entity for a related case:P.K.

After hearing of Trinley Thaye Dorje's marriage in April 2017, the Rumtek monks shifted hunger strikes to include marching protests in the streets of Sikkim while bringing attention to the unresolved issues, as their patience wans. After 630 days of strikes, on 29 March 2018 India announced the Karmapa has been granted permission to travel in Sikkim, but not to Rumtek Monastery.Tibetan Review, (01 April 2018), https://www.tibetanreview.net/new-delhi-permits-karmapa-to-visit-sikkim-but-not-rumtek/ An association of monks announced the hunger strikes will continue until the Karmapa arrives in Sikkim. =Ogyen Trinley Dorje meeting with Shamar Rinpoche in 2007= According to both the official Shamarpa website and an official Ogyen Trinley Dorje website, Ogyen Trinley Dorje met with the Shamarpa in the Oberoi International Hotel in New Delhi on 9 January 2007. Ogyen Trinley Dorje had mentioned his desire to meet the Shamarpa, and requested Ch√∂kyi Nyima Rinpoche arrange a personal meeting with him. The Shamarpa had declined the first invitation in 2005, which was received by telephone call from Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, because to have accepted it \\"at that time would invite unwarranted suspicions from the India government upon himself.\\" According to Dawa Tsering, spokesperson for the administration of Shamar Rinpoche, \\"He (Urgyen Trinley Dorje) was confident that this meeting would bring peace in the Kagyu School in general and thus help in flourishing Buddha Dharma. This meeting has created a basis to re-unite all in the Dharma Sangha. Therefore, such an initiative should be appreciated by all.\\" According to the message of International Karma Kagyu Buddhist Organization published on www.karmapa-issue.org: \\"To underscore his willingness to be supportive, Shamar Rinpoche even provided the necessary help for Ugyen Trinlay Dorje to obtain Indian government's approval for his recent visit to the U.S., though at the same time maintaining the stance that Thrinlay Thaye Dorje is the traditional Karmapa.\\"Message of IKKBO by K. Wangchuk, May 23, 2008 =Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche meet in 2010= The Dalai Lama and Shamar Rinpoche met on the 13th of August, 2010 at the Dalai Lama's residence to discuss ways of ending the controversy. Shamarpa wrote, \\"Although this matter is not easily resolved, since it is connected to the politics of China and India as well, with His Holiness Dalai Lama's blessing and support I am confident that there will be an amicable solution, which will be beneficial for the Karma Kagy√º lineage, as well as for Tibetan Buddhism in general.\\" =India accuses Ogyen Trinley Dorje of being a Chinese spy in 2011= In February 2011, Ogyen Trinley Dorje was accused of being a Chinese spy by government officials of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh,Namrata Biji Ahuja, To counter China, India should let the 17th Karmapa return, (12 August 2020), https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2020/08/12/to-counter-china-india-should-allow-the-return-of-the-17th-karmapa.html allegations to which the Karmapa has denied. India's intelligence report is said to be lacking sufficient evidence. Money in the amount of $1 million cash was found in his monastery, part of it in Chinese yuan later found to be legitimate donations. In the midst of tense geo-political concerns about China, the Karmapa's recognition by China in 1992 created suspicions in India. The recognition of Ogyen Trinley Dorje as \\"the first reincarnated Living Buddha confirmed and approved by the Central Government of the People's Republic of China\\" after 1951 predicated China's stated plans to replace the Dalai Lama with the Karmapa, which is not the Karmapa's intention. In March 2011, the Indian central government released some of the travel restrictions on Ogyen Trinley Dorje, allowing him to travel out of DharamsalaNew Delhi escapes Karmapa muddle, (27 March 2011), http://www.sikkimtimes.com/Columns/New-Delhi-escapes-Karmapa-muddle.html where his movements were restricted since 2000. He since gained travel documents from Dominica. Calls for the lifting of India's remaining travel restrictions so the Karmapa can travel to his seat at Rumtek Monastery have multiplied in 2020, as restrictions have been lifted on his travel to Sikkim. =Trinley Thaye Dorje weds in 2017= On 29 March 2017, Trinley Thaye Dorje announced his plans to disrobe and marry his friend, 36-year-old Rinchen Yangzom, born in Bhutan.

There is a recently refurbished riverside walk to Clonmel along a former canal tow-path. This has recently been upgraded and replanted. For the purposes of elections to D√°il √âireann, the town is part of the Tipperary constituency. History =Influence of the Butler family= Carrick-on-Suir (originally called Carrig Mac Griffin) was formed on an island settlement upstream of Waterford. The town remained as an island until the 18th century when small rivers were diverted to form dry land north and west of the town. The earliest known records of a settlement are dated to 1247, when a charter of 3 fairs per year was awarded to Matthew Fitzgriffin, Lord of the manor of Carrick who was a member of the Cambro- Norman nobility. By the early 14th century, Carrick Mac Griffin had become home to a prosperous Hiberno-Norman family - the Butlers. The first significant leader of the Butler clan, Edmond Butler (a.k.a. Edmund le Bottilier) was created Earl of Carrick in 1315. However, his son James did not inherit the title. Instead, 7 years after the death of his father, he was created Earl of Ormond in his own right. In 1447, Edmund MacRichard Butler founded the first bridge over the estuary at Carrick-on-Suir. Other notable members of the Butler clan were Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond (a.k.a. Black Tom) who built the Tudor Manor House extension to Ormonde Castle and James the 12th Earl and 1st Duke of Ormond, who founded the town's woollen industry in 1670. Edmond le Bottiler erected two large, heavily garrisoned castle keeps named the Plantagenet Castle on the north bank of the Suir, just east of what is now Main St. In the 15th century, a four towered castle was erected on the same site, two of which are now incorporated into the Elizabethan Manor House built by Black Tom Butler, c. 1560. The Manor House still stands today, having been extensively refurbished by the State in the 1990s and is open to the public. The town was also the inspiration for the 16th-century song, Cail√≠n √≥ chois na Si√∫ire m√©, which is attested to in 1595 and mentioned in Shakespeare's Henry V AS Caleno custure me. In 1649, the town was taken by English Parliamentarians during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. They captured Carrick by stealth after discovering an undefended gate as part of operations during the Siege of Waterford. Irish troops from Ulster under a Major Geoghegan tried to re-take Carrick but were eventually beaten off with the loss of over 500 killed. In 1670 the Butlers set up a woollen industry in the town. By 1799, the town enjoyed some prosperity from the woollen industry, fishing, basket weaving and other river-related businesses - the population reached around 11,000 by this point. In that year, a barge capsized on the river near the bride, resulting in the deaths of around 91 people. Over the next 120 years however, the town suffered from high taxes and levies imposed by the British on the woollen industry, leading to high unemployment, poverty and emigration. The Great Famine also contributed greatly to the depopulation of the town. =20th century= With the coming of Independence and the Civil War, Carrick was initially occupied by the Anti- Treaty IRA until the town fell to the Free State army in 1922. By this stage, industrialisation had reached Carrick with the establishment of cotton factories and a local creamery. Most significant however for the economic development of the town was the arrival of the tanning industry in the 1930s, providing regular, dependable employment in the town for the first time. The local town council also embarked on building social housing projects in an effort to deal with appalling living conditions in the town for those economically disadvantaged. Despite these developments, economic opportunities were limited and poverty widespread - the town saw widespread emigration to Dublin, Britain and further afield especially during the long recessions of the 1940s and 1950s. The closure of the Pollack & Plunder tannery in 1985 caused immense hardship in the town, as a significant proportion of the population (Carrick's population was roughly 4,000 by this point) were employed there or were dependent on someone who was. Carrick suffered a prolonged recession throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, again leading the population to drop due to emigration - a fate suffered by other small, rural Irish towns during the period. By the late-1990s, the economy of the town was on the upswing - unemployment had dropped, the SRAM bicycle component factory had opened as had numerous small businesses, and the population began to increase again for the first time in two centuries. Carrick's local infrastructure (in particular health and transport) still remains relatively undeveloped, due to its location on the border of 3 counties (and subsequent lack of political muscle both at county and national level), and the nearby larger towns of Clonmel and Waterford. As of 2006, no large manufacturing operation remains in the town - the SRAM plant closed in 2006, but Carrick continues to prosper economically. The population continues to increase, and the town expands with ongoing significant house building projects. The future of Carrick is likely to be that of a commuter town, servicing those working in Waterford and Clonmel - a role it has been performing for decades. Features and amenities There are two theatres in Carrick-on-Suir, the Brewery Lane Theatre and the Operatic Society. While the Operatic society tends to focus on musicals, operas and pantomimes, Brewery Lane usually does dramas which can be serious, or often black comedy. Many of these are Irish. The Old Bridge, built in 1447. =River Suir= Carrick-on-Suir is the tidal limit of the River Suir. Carrick has a 1-in-50-year flood defence system with quay walls ranging in height from 1.2m to 1.5m. Currently, the walls give protection from flooding caused by high tides. Flooding still occurs along the Glen/Mill River and Markievicz Tce. Town Hall, built in 1840. =Landmarks= In 1447, a stone bridge was built, now known as the \\"Old Bridge\\". A new, more modern bridge (later named after John Dillon) was built in the early 20th century. The central part of the Old Bridge (and likewise the Dillon bridge) was destroyed by retreating IRA forces in 1922 in an attempt to slow the advance of the Free State army, but both were rebuilt by 1927. The West Gate on the street of the same name is the last remaining gates of the town wall. Several, at times very narrow lanes (Oven Lane, Cook Lane, Rowe's Lane etc) leading off Main Street are testament to the Medieval layout of the town. Carrick's town clock was erected in 1784. A public park was created in the fair green in the 1860s. The town fair continues to this day, having been moved from the fair green in the 1920s to a new site just west of the fair green. =Churches= There are three Catholic churches. The largest church in Carrick M√≥r is St Nicholas' church which was built in 1879, replacing an earlier church of the same name built in 1804. In Carrick Beg are the small St Molleran's parish church (parts of which date back to the 13th century) and the larger Franciscan friary. The Franciscan order's presence in Carrick dates back to 1336 with the granting of land for a friary by the 1st Earl of Ormond. However, the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII led to the closure of the friary. Just prior to the invasion of Ireland by Cromwell, the friars had returned for an 11-year period, before being shut down again and the friars having to go underground to avoid persecution. It was not until 1820 and the onset of Catholic Emancipation that the friars were able to fully return and a new chapel was built. The friars served the local community until the lack of vocations to the order led to the order finally leaving Carrick-Beg in 2006. The Church of Ireland community was relatively substantial until independence community's church on Main Street was abandoned until the late 1980s when the church building and grounds were renovated and now serve as a heritage centre. Sport GAA is represented in the area by Carrick Davins (named after the first GAA president Maurice Davin), Carrick Swans and St. Molleran's GAA clubs. The former two play in the Tipperary GAA area, and the latter in the Waterford GAA area. The 1904 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final was played in Carrick-on-Suir. The match was held on Maurice Davin's land on 24 June 1906 between Cork and Kilkenny. Kilkenny won by a single point, 1-9 to 1-8. Carrick United AFC is a junior (non-league, amateur) soccer team that plays in the Waterford & District League. The club plays at Tom Drohan park, and has had some success in the Waterford & District League, Munster Senior and Junior Cups and also in the FAI Junior Cup. An amateur rugby team, Carrick-on-Suir RFC, plays in the Munster Junior League Division II. The club grounds are located east of the town in Tybroughney, County Kilkenny. There is an 18-hole golf club, golf driving range, and swimming pool in the area. Castleview Lawn Tennis Club has four artificial grass courts, and Carrick-on Suir Handball and Racquetball Club is at Davin Park Indoor courts, Clonmel Road. In cycling, Sam Bennett and Sean Kelly are both from the town, as are the Iverk Produce Carrick Wheelers and Carrick Wheelers Road Clubs. There are also two boxing clubs (Carrick-on-Suir Boxing Club and St. Nicholas Boxing Club) and a triathlon club. 1986 English Greyhound Derby champion Tico was born in the town. Clubs and societies The Carrick-on-Suir Musical Society (formed in 1943) is an award-winning musical and amateur operatic society. The Musical Society bought and refurbished the Strand Theatre on Main Street in 2003 for use by the Society. The Brewery Lane Drama Society (formed in 1955) performs several productions a year at their 75-person capacity theatre, which was formerly a malt house owned by Smithwicks. The Irish Traction Group is based in Carrick-on-Suir, where restoration work is carried out on vintage diesel locomotives. Carrick-on-Suir also has a Republican Flute Band which plays at many Irish Republican and Sinn F√©in events. Carrick Swim Club (Carrick Dippers) use the Sean Kelly Sports Centre as their base.

H. Friston from The Illustrated London News, 1872, shows Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, Thespis and Mercury (right) Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old, is an operatic extravaganza that was the first collaboration between dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan. No musical score of Thespis was ever published, and most of the music has been lost. Gilbert and Sullivan went on to become the most famous and successful artistic partnership in Victorian England, creating a string of comic opera hits, including H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado, which continue to be popular. Thespis was premi√®red in London at the Gaiety Theatre on 26 December 1871. Like many productions at that theatre, it was written in a broad, burlesque style, considerably different from Gilbert and Sullivan's later works. It was a success, for a Christmas entertainment of the time,Walters, Michael. \\"Thespis: a reply\\", W. S. Gilbert Society Journal, Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29. Summer 2011. and closed on 8 March 1872, after a run of 63 performances.The length of the run is given as 64 performances in some sources. According to Rees (p. 78, n. 7), that is because they fail to take into account that there was no performance of Thespis on Ash Wednesday. It was advertised as \\"An entirely original Grotesque Opera in Two Acts\\".Rollins and Witts, p. 3 The story follows an acting troupe headed by Thespis, the legendary Greek father of the drama, who temporarily trade places with the gods on Mount Olympus, who have grown elderly and ignored. The actors turn out to be comically inept rulers. Having seen the ensuing mayhem down below, the angry gods return, sending the actors back to Earth as \\"eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see\\". Gilbert would return to this theme twenty-five years later in his last opera with Sullivan, The Grand Duke, in which a theatre company temporarily replaces the ruler of a small country and decides to \\"revive the classic memories of Athens at its best\\". Seasonal works like Thespis were not normally expected to endure, and apart from a benefit performance shortly after the original staging, Thespis was not performed again during its creators' lifetimes. A renewed interest in the piece began in the 1950s, and numerous productions have been performed since, either with music taken from Sullivan's other works, or with original music. Synopsis =Act I= Thespis meets the gods ‚Äì detail from a larger engraving. Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth. Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis. The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fianc√©e, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter. Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need. =Act II= Thespis rules on whether Sparkeion is married to the woman that suits his mythological role, or the one he actually married. The Same Scene, One Year Later, with the Ruins Restored Under Thespis's direction, Olympus has been restored to its former splendour, and the Thespians enjoy ambrosia and nectar. Thespis's rule is very liberal, and he has advised his troupe not to \\"be hampered by routine and red tape and precedent\\". The celestial assignments, however, have caused some difficulties, as the romantic entanglements of the actors in real life conflict with those of the gods that they are playing. Venus, played by Pretteia, is supposed to be married to Mars, but the actor playing Mars is her father. A possible solution is discovered in Venus having actually married Vulcan, but Vulcan is her grandfather. Sparkeion, who took on the role of Apollo, accompanies his wife, Nicemis, who plays Diana, on her nightly duties, so that the sun is up during the night. Mercury informs Thespis that the substitute gods have received many complaints from mortals because some are not performing their functions, and others' ill-judged experiments have wreaked havoc in the world below. For instance, Timidon, the replacement for Mars, is a pacifist and a coward; the substitute for Hymen refuses to marry anyone; and the ersatz Pluto is too tenderhearted to let anyone die. Daphne, who plays the muse Calliope, comes to Thespis and claims, based on a bowdlerised edition of the Greek myths, that Calliope was married to Apollo. She points out that Apollo, played by Sparkeion, is the brother of Diana (played by Sparkeion's wife, Nicemis). Thespis decides that Sparkeion is married to Daphne while they are gods, but his marriage to Nicemis will resume when they are mortals once again. When the gods return, they are furious and tell Thespis that he has \\"deranged the whole scheme of society\\". Thespis says that they should calm down, as the list of mortals' complaints is about to be read. The gods watch incognito as Mercury presents the complaints: The actors have ruined the weather; caused strife among the nations; and there is no wine, since Bacchus is a teetotaller. After listening to these grievances, the gods angrily shed their disguises. The actors beg to stay on Olympus, but Jupiter punishes them for their folly by sending them back to earth cursed as \\"eminent tragedians, whom no one ever goes to see\\".

The Ballet Master was W. H. PayneCasting information from Rees, pp. 12‚Äì18 and 102. Crew and principal dancer information is from Rollins and Witts, p. 3 Background =Genesis= John Hollingshead had a lot of balls in the air: This engraving shows him juggling ballet, op√©ra bouffe, and drama. Impresario and author John Hollingshead, the lessee of London's Gaiety Theatre since 1868, had produced a number of successful musical burlesques and operettas there. Indeed, Hollingshead \\"boasted that he kept alight 'the sacred lamp of burlesque.'\\"Dark & Grey, p. 63. Gilbert and Sullivan were each well acquainted with the Gaiety and its house artistes. Gilbert's Robert the Devil (a burlesque of the opera Robert le Diable) had been on the programme on the theatre's opening night on 21 December 1868, with Nellie Farren in the title role, and played successfully for over 100 nights. Article about Robert the Devil (Jewry in Music site) , accessed 30 March 2008 Constance Loseby and Annie Tremaine (both of whom had roles in Thespis) were also in the cast of Robert, and Arthur Sullivan was in the audience on that opening night as one of Hollingshead's guests.Ainger, p. 80. It was a great success, \\"received with a storm of approbation\\".Ainger, p. 80, quoting a review in the Times of 24 December 1868. Less successfully, Gilbert had also written a play for the theatre in 1869 called An Old Score.Stedman, pp. 73‚Äì74. Hollingshead would later say that the piece was \\"too true to nature\\".Ainger, p. 82, quoting Hollingshead, Good Old Gaiety: An Historiette & Remembrance, p. 16 (1903) London: Gaiety Theatre Co. By late September or early October 1871, Gaiety programmes announced that \\"The Christmas Operatic Extravaganza will be written by W. S. Gilbert, with original music by Arthur Sullivan.\\"Rees, p. 10. There would be prominent roles for the popular comedian J. L. Toole, as well as Farren, the theatre's star \\"principal boy\\" in all of its burlesques. How and when the pair came to collaborate on Thespis is uncertain. Gilbert was a logical choice for the assignment. With seven operas and plays premi√®ring that year and over a dozen other burlesques, farces and extravaganzas under his belt, he was well known to London theatregoers as a comic dramatist.Goldberg, p. 144. Sullivan, however, was at this point mainly known for his serious music. His completed music that year included the choral cantata On Shore and Sea, a suite of incidental music for Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, and numerous hymns, including \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\". He did have two comic operas to his credit, Cox and Box (1866) and The Contrabandista (1867), but the latter was four years in the past and had been unsuccessful. In September 1871, Sullivan had been engaged to conduct at The Royal National Opera, but it failed abruptly, leaving him unexpectedly without commitments.Rees, p. 11. Hollingshead's offer of a role to his brother, Fred Sullivan, may have encouraged him to write the music for Thespis.Ainger, p. 93. The production \\"aroused a great deal of interest and speculation\\".Rees, p. 26. Ironically, it had \\"probably the largest audience\\" of any Gilbert and Sullivan premi√®re, as the Gaiety was the largest of the five London theatres at which their joint works premi√®red.Allen (First Night), p. 1. =Composition= Gilbert had a busy autumn. His play On Guard had an unsuccessful run at the Court Theatre, opening on 28 October 1871,Ainger, p. 92. while his most successful play to date, Pygmalion and Galatea, opened on 9 December, only a few days before rehearsals for Thespis were to begin. Sullivan, however, had more time on his hands after a Manchester production of The Merchant of Venice, for which he supplied incidental music, had its premi√®re on 9 September.Ainger, p. 91. Both Gilbert and Sullivan recalled that Thespis was written in some haste. Sullivan recalled, simply, that \\"both music and libretto were very hurriedly written\\".Lawrence, p. 85. In his 1883 autobiography, Gilbert wrote: By 1902, Gilbert's recollection of the time frame had expanded to five weeks: Interior of the Gaiety, 1869 Gilbert's five-week estimate is \\"in conflict with other apparently incontrovertible facts\\".Rees, pp. 23‚Äì24. See also Allen (First Night), p. 2, who concludes that \\"these four or five weeks of Thespis preparation were not consecutive.\\" Sullivan's nephew, Herbert Sullivan, wrote that the libretto was already in existence before his uncle became involved in the project: \\"Gilbert showed [Hollingshead] the libretto of an operatic Extravaganza Thespis, and Hollingshead forthwith sent it to Sullivan to set.\\"Sullivan & Flower, p. 68. Also, Goldberg, p. 143. Gilbert generally sketched out his libretti some months in advance of a production but did not write a finished libretto until he had a firm commitment to produce it. Wachs, Kevin. \\"Let‚Äôs vary piracee / With a little burglaree!\\" , The Gasbag, Issue 227, Winter 2005, accessed 8 May 2012. At the very least, a \\"rough draft of the plot\\"Rees, p. 25 must have existed by 30 October, in light of a letter on that date from Gilbert's agent to R. M. Field of the Boston Museum Theatre, which reads: Gilbert did, in fact, conclude an agreement with Field, and the first published libretto advised: \\"Caution to American Pirates.‚ÄîThe Copyright of the Dialogue and Music of this Piece, for the United States and Canada, has been assigned to Mr. Field, of the Boston Museum, by agreement, dated 7th December, 1871.\\" If Field mounted the work, however, the production has not been traced. Gilbert's concern about American copyright pirates foreshadowed the difficulties he and Sullivan would later encounter with unauthorised \\"pirated\\" productions of H.M.S. Pinafore, The Mikado and their other popular works. In any case, the libretto was \\"published and circulated\\" in London in mid-December.Allen (First Night), p. 2Rees, p. 24 =Production= J. L. Toole, about 1874With the piece set to open on 26 December,Stedman, p. 94 Gilbert first read the libretto to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing the central role of Thespis, did not return from a tour of the British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, Dearer than Life, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.Rees, pp. 19‚Äì21 Despite the short time available for rehearsals, Sullivan recalled that Gilbert insisted that the chorus play a major role, as it would do in their later Savoy operas: Reception =Opening night= The premi√®re was under rehearsed, as several critics noted, and the work was also evidently in need of cutting: Gaiety management had advised that carriages should be called for 11:00 p.m., but Thespis was still playing past midnight.Allen (First Night), pp. 4‚Äì5 The Orchestra reported that \\"scarcely one player... was more than 'rough perfect' in his part.\\" The Observer commented that \\"the acting, as well as the business, will want working up before it can be fairly criticized... the opera... was not ready\\".The Observer, 31 December 1871 The Daily Telegraph suggested that \\"It is more satisfactory for many reasons to look upon the performance last evening as a full dress rehearsal.... When Thespis ends at the orthodox Gaiety closing hour, and the opera has been energetically rehearsed, few happier entertainments will be found.\\"Rees, p. 76. Some critics could not see past the production's state of disarray. The Hornet captioned its review, \\"Thespis; or, the Gods Grown Old and WEARISOME!\\" The Morning Advertiser found it \\"a dreary, tedious two-act rigmarole of a plot... grotesque without wit, and the music thin without liveliness... however, not entirely devoid of melody.... The curtain falls before a yawning and weary audience.\\"Allen (First Night), p. 5 But others found much to admire in the work, despite the poor opening performance. The Illustrated Times wrote: Critic Clement Scott Clement Scott, writing in the Daily Telegraph, had a mostly favourable reaction: The Observer commented, \\"...we have authors and musicians quite as talented as [the French].... The subject of Thespis is unquestionably funny.... Mr. Arthur Sullivan has entered with heart into the spirit of Mr. Gilbert's fun, he has brightened it up with the most fanciful and delightful music\\". =Subsequent performances= Many writers in the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was considered a failure.Wyndham, p. 119; Walbrook, p. 35; Dark & Grey, p. 63; Dunhill, p. 45; Fitz-Gerald, p. 2; Sullivan & Flower, p. 68; Pearson, p. 89. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871‚Äì72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed by the end of March.Rees, p. 78. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre. Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion, for whose benefit the last performance of Thespis with the original music was givenAs they would do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and alterations after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, \\"I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain at the end of Act II.\\"Sullivan & Flower, pp. 68‚Äì69 The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night. By the third night, the London Figaro could report: \\"I must say that not a single hitch in the performance is now to be perceived, and that the applause and evident delight of the audience from beginning to end, the piece occupying a space of time within two hours.\\" On 6 January 1872, the Penny Illustrated Paper commented that \\"Mr. Gilbert's Gaiety extravaganza grows in public favour and deservedly so\\". On 9 January, the Daily Telegraph reported a visit by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh. By 27 January, the Illustrated Times noted that \\"a chance playgoer will certainly not find a seat at the Gaiety.... Thespis can, after all, boast the success which was predicted\\". Land and Water reported on 3 February that \\"Thespis is now in capital working order.\\"Rees, p. 79. Performances of Thespis were interrupted on 14 February 1872, Ash Wednesday, since London theatres refrained from presenting costumed performances out of respect for the religious holiday. Instead, a \\"miscellaneous entertainment\\" was given at the Gaiety, consisting of ventriloquists, performing dogs and, coincidentally, a sketch parodying a penny reading by the young George Grossmith, who, several years later, became Gilbert and Sullivan's principal comedian.Moss, Simon. \\"Gilbert & Sullivan: A Selling Exhibition of Memorabilia\\", accessed 30 October 2007 On 17 February, Henry Sutherland Edwards wrote in the Musical World: \\"In almost all conjunctions of music and words, there is a sacrifice of one to the other; but in Thespis... Sufficient opportunities have been given for music; and the music serves only to adorn the piece.\\" Similar reports continued to appear through early March, when Thespis closed. The final performance during the authors' lifetimes was given less than two months later, on 27 April, at a matin√©e for the benefit of Mlle. Clary, the original Sparkeion. On such an occasion, a performer would normally choose a piece likely to sell well, as the beneficiary was entitled to the income (after expenses), and tickets were generally offered at \\"inflated prices\\".Rees, pp. 81‚Äì82. The actress was a Gaiety favourite, \\"not only in respect of her voice but also her delicious French accent and, of course, her figure.\\"Rees, p. 14. Others recalled \\"the charm of Mlle. Clary, with her pretty face and piquant broken English\\".Walbrook, p. 34. She had been particularly successful as Sparkeion,Allen (First Night), p. 5; Walbrook, chapter II; The Observer, 31 December 1871 and her song in Act II, \\"Little Maid of Arcadee\\", was the only one chosen for publication. =Aftermath= Richard D'Oyly Carte After the production of Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways, reuniting three years later, with Richard D'Oyly Carte as their manager, to produce Trial by Jury in 1875. When that work was a surprise success, there were discussions of quickly reviving Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan: The proposed revival was mentioned in several more letters throughout the autumn of 1875, until on 23 November Gilbert wrote, \\"I have heard no more about Thespis. It is astonishing how quickly these capitalists dry up under the magic influence of the words 'cash down'.\\"Ainger, p. 114. In 1895, with Richard D'Oyly Carte struggling to rediscover success at the Savoy, he once again proposed a revival of Thespis, but the idea was not pursued.Stedman, p. 95. No mention of the whereabouts of the music of Thespis exists since 1897, and scholars have searched for it among many of the extant collections.Tillett & Spencer, p. 3. Except for two songs and some ballet music, it is presumed lost. The reasons why Thespis went unrevived are not known. Some commentators speculate that Sullivan used the music in his other operas.Walbrook, p. 27; Fitz-Gerald, p. 2; Dunhill, p. 45; Allen (First Night), p. 6 If this were true, then \\"for this reason alone a revival would have become impossible\\".Rees, p. 88. However, evidence that Sullivan did so has eluded discovery.Tillett & Spencer, p. 3; Stedman, pp. 95‚Äì96 Another possible explanation is that Gilbert and Sullivan came to regard Thespis, with its \\"brazen girls in tights and short skirts\\", and broad burlesque-style humour, as \\"the kind of work they wished to avoid\\". They later renounced travesti roles and revealing dresses on their actresses, and made publicly known their disapproval of them. In 1885, Hollingshead wrote to the Pall Mall Gazette, \\"Mr. Gilbert is somewhat severe on a style of burlesque which he did much to popularise in the old days before he invented what I may call burlesque in long clothes. ‚Ä¶ Mr Gilbert never objected to the dresses in Robert the Devil nor to the dresses in Thespis.\\"Correspondence, The Pall Mall Gazette, 26 January 1885, p. 4 In 1879, Sullivan, Gilbert and Carte were in the midst of a legal battle with the former directors of the Comedy Opera Company, which had produced H.M.S. Pinafore. Sullivan wrote to Hollingshead, saying: \\"You once settled a precedent for me which may just at present be of great importance to me. I asked you for the band parts of the Merry Wives of Windsor... and [you] said, 'They are yours, as our run is over....' Now will you please let me have them, and the parts of Thespis also at once. I am detaining the parts of Pinafore, so that the directors shall not take them away from the Comique tomorrow, and I base my claim on the precedent you set.\\"Rees, p. 89. =Modern productions= After its last performance at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered.Tillett & Spencer, p. 4. Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music for all but the surviving songs, or, in a few cases, re-compose those as well.Tillett & Spencer, p. 6. No version has become predominant in recent productions. Theatre historian Terence Rees developed a version of the libretto that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto.Rees, p. 101-45 Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert's non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs. A score was supplied by Garth Morton, based on music from lesser-known Sullivan operas, and this version has been recorded.Annotated libretto to Thespis, prepared by Ian Bond, noting Rees' additions for the performance version. The interpolated songs do not appear in Rees' Thespis, a Gilbert and Sullivan Enigma. A version with an original score by Bruce Montgomery (other than the two Sullivan numbers) has been performed several times, including in 2000 at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival.

Assessment =More than the usual burlesque= W. S. Gilbert in about 1871 Thespis was an advance on the types of burlesques to which Gaiety audiences were accustomed. Fran√ßois Cellier recalled much later: Several critics suggested that the piece may have been too sophisticated for its audience‚Äîor at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on Boxing Night. The Times wrote: \\"The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season.\\"Allen (First Night), p. 4 Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: Sporting Life suggested that \\"It may be that they looked for something less polished than Mr. Gilbert's verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author's humour. It may be, too, that Thespis was a little‚ÄîI only say, just a little‚Äî'over their heads'.\\"Rees, p. 77 The Orchestra carried a similar sentiment: \\"In fact, both music and idea were somewhat over the heads of the audience.\\" =Libretto= Fun The plot of Thespis, with its elderly gods tired of their life in Olympus, is similar to some of Offenbach's operas, notably Orph√©e aux Enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld). In Orph√©e, like Thespis, classical mythology, particularly the Olympian gods, are ruthlessly parodied.Williams, p. 44 In Thespis, the gods swap places with actors and descend to Earth; in Orph√©e, the gods head to hell for a pleasant holiday away from boring perfection. Offenbach's plot ‚Äì for although Cr√©mieux and Hal√©vy wrote the libretto, the idea was Offenbach's ‚Äì places Orpheus, the great musician, in the centre; however, Gilbert's plot focuses on Thespis, the Father of the Drama. While this may be a coincidence, it could also be seen as a response to Offenbach, as his plot places music at the centre of his operetta, but Gilbert's elevates the dramatist.Crowther (2000) p. 71‚Äì72 The libretto has been praised by several biographers and historians. One said that \\"The dialogue contains many an authentic Gilbertian touch.\\"Walbrook, p. 31. Another found it \\"a gay, sparkling libretto\\".Goldberg, p. 152. Sidney Dark and Rowland Gray wrote that \\"the book of Thespis is genuine Gilbert, the Gilbert whom nowadays all the world loves.... Thespis once more emphasizes the fact that Gilbert's artistry was hardly affected with the passing of the years. Many of its songs might well have appeared in the later operas.\\" They point out Mercury's \\"I'm the celestial drudge\\", which anticipates Giuseppe's \\"Rising early in the morning\\" in The Gondoliers, and find the \\"real brand of Gilbertian topsy-turvydom\\" in the song about the former head of a railway company, \\"I once knew a chap who discharged a function\\".Dark & Gray, p. 65. Isaac Goldberg thought that \\"Thespis looks forward far more often than it glances backward: It forecasts the characteristic methods, and now and then a character, of the later series. Its dialogue is comical, and, if anything, somewhat above the heads of the Gaiety audiences of 1871.\\"Goldberg, p. 148. Goldberg wrote in 1929 that the libretto \\"seems to have no specific ancestry.... neither in his burlesques nor in his ballads... had Gilbert played with the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology.\\"Goldberg, p. 146. However, Gilbert did write a series of humorous sketches parodying the Greek myths, mainly the heroes of the Iliad, for the illustrated magazine Fun in 1864,Stedman, p. 23; See also Gilbert, W. S., (1864): The Comic Mythologist from Fun, 5 November 1864. and Pygmalion and Galatea, which he produced just before Thespis, was a more serious treatment of Greek mythology. Jane W. Stedman points out that Thespis \\"looks backward to French op√©ra bouffe\\", but it is \\"fundamentally a Gilbertian invasion plot in which outsiders penetrate and affect a given society, often for the worse.\\" She compares the theatrical company in Thespis to the politicians that remodel fairyland in Gilbert's 1873 play The Happy Land and the Englishmen who reform the island nation of Utopia in Utopia, Limited (1893). Elements of Thespis also appear in Gilbert and Sullivan's last opera together, The Grand Duke (1896), where a theatre company replaces the ruler and decides to \\"revive the classic memories of Athens at its best\\".Crowther (2000), p. 165 =The music= Sullivan's score generally came in for praise, though critics carped‚Äîas they would throughout his life‚Äîthat theatrical scores were beneath his ability. In the Standard, A. E. T. Watson wrote: Arthur Sullivan in about 1871 Clement Scott in The Daily Telegraph found the opera \\"not marred by ambitious music\\". But he added, \\"Tuneful throughout, always pretty, frequently suggestive, the songs and dances are quite in character with the author's design.... Some of the numbers will certainly live, and the impression caused by the music as a whole is that it will have far more than a passing interest.\\" Many critics praised the originality of the title character's song in the first act about the head of a railway company, which may have been a joke about the Duke of Sutherland, \\"who was fond of running railway engines\\".Goldberg, p. 150. Scott called the song a \\"ludicrous ballad\\", but \\"quite in the spirit of the well-known compositions of 'Bab,' and, as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus, a hearty encore was inevitable. Though the ditty was long, the audience would have been well content to hear it all over again.\\" The Pall Mall Gazette found the orchestration \\"very novel, including, as it does, the employment of a railway bell, a railway whistle, and some new instrument of music imitating the agreeable sound of a train in motion.\\"Jacobs, p. 73. Similarly The Sunday Times noted, \\"The entire company join in the chorus, the music of which admirably expresses the whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed.\\"Rees, p. 64. The Era called it \\"a screaming, whistling and shouting chorus [that] fairly brings down the house\\". The similarity to French models was much commented upon. Vanity Fair thought that \\"the music in the piece itself is charming throughout, and promises for the first time a rival to Offenbach.... Thespis is quite as good as Orph√©e aux Enfers.\\"Rees, p. 58. Another wrote: The Morning Advertiser thought that \\"There is an evident attempt to copy the creations of a foreign composer who is so popular at the present time, and who has written some charming music for the gods and goddesses en bouffes.\\"Rees, p. 59. Others accused Sullivan of blatant copying. The Athenaeum wrote that the music \\"was arranged and composed by Mr A. S. Sullivan (the first verb was not in the bills as it ought to have been)\\". One critic thought that the duet for Sparkeion and Nicemis, \\"Here far away from all the world\\", was one of the \\"single best items of the piece\\".Tillett & Spencer, p. 14. In 1873, the arranger Joseph Rummell (who had arranged Sullivan's Merchant of Venice score for the piano) wrote to Sullivan, asking about the song, with a view to publication. The composer replied, \\"Thespis is not published but if you like I will send you the Full Score of the Duet in question\\",Allen & D'Luhy, p. 67 but nothing came of it. Surviving music Only three musical passages from Thespis are known to survive: the ballad \\"Little maid of Arcadee\\", the chorus \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", and the ballet music. The fate of Sullivan's score has long been a subject for speculation. In 1978, Isaac Asimov wrote a time travel story, \\"Fair Exchange?\\", which focused on a character travelling back to 1871 to rescue the score to Thespis before Sullivan could destroy it.Asimov, Isaac. \\"Fair Exchange?\\", Asimov's Science Fiction Adventure Magazine, Davis Publications, Inc., Fall 1978, pp. 56‚Äì65. Also in Also in But Sullivan is not known to have destroyed it, and the ballet, at least, was still available to be reused in 1897. =Little maid of Arcadee= Sparkeion's song in Act II, \\"Little maid of Arcadee\\",Arcadia was a legendary site of rural perfection, first described by the Ancient Greeks, that was a popular setting for writers of the 19th century. Gilbert, in 1872, would write a work called Happy Arcadia, and in Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe, two of the characters are \\"arcadian shepherds\\". was the only number from the opera to achieve contemporaneous publication. It was one of four numbers to be encored on the first night. The Daily Telegraph wrote: \\"With the public no doubt the musical gem will be a ballad called 'Cousin Robin'‚Äîpathetic and tender words, with a dreamy and somewhat Gounodish air. So sweetly was this sung by Mdlle. Clary that another encore was inevitable.\\" The Observer agreed that the song \\"...will cause most delight on account of the quaint simplicity and tenderness of the words, the charming singing of Mdlle. Clary, and the really exquisite setting by Mr. Sullivan.... This is a musical gem\\". left The song enjoyed long-standing popularity. Wyndham writes, \\"Little maid of Arcadee\\" was \\"popular for a quarter of a century\\".Wyndham, p. 119. Sullivan's first biographer suggested that \\"Thespis will be best remembered by the exquisite musical setting to the simple little Gilbertian ballad\\". Several later commentators write favourably of the song. Walbrook finds it \\"one of the neatest of Gilbert's ditties, packed with cynicism and slyness, expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness.\\"Walbrook, p. 33. Goldberg says that it is \\"dainty, simple and quite in the vein of Gilbert's words, to which, as in almost every later instance, Sullivan's setting provides an original rhythmic piquancy.\\"Goldberg, p. 151. Fitz-Gerald considers it \\"quite a forerunner of Gilbert at his easiest\\",Fitz-Gerald, p. 4. while Dark and Gray call it \\"a typically dainty Gilbertian love-song worthy to be compared to the best that he ever wrote.\\" Jacobs dissents: \\"As music it is as trivial as Sullivan ever wrote.\\" The separately published version had several significant wording differences from the theatrical version, owing to \\"the contrast between the Gaiety Theatre's suggestiveness and the prudery expected in the drawing room\\". In the drawing room version, the song's little maid sat by Cousin Robin's knee, not on it. Rather than weary of his lover's play, he became fickle as the month of May. And rather than Cousin Richard came to woo, it was till another came to woo. =Climbing over rocky mountain= \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" was reused in Gilbert and Sullivan's fifth opera together, The Pirates of Penzance. \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is the best known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead. Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.March, Jerry. \\"Part of Thespis Score Discovered\\", The Savoyard, Vol. XX, No. 1 (March 1981), p. 25. Also cited in Stedman, p. 95, n. 52. Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted.Allen (First Night), p. 6 Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis.Tillett & Spencer (2002). However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", neither author admitted to borrowing from Thespis for later works.Stedman, pp. 95‚Äì96. =Ballet= 400pxA five-movement ballet occurred somewhere in Act II, staged by W. H. Payne.Payne was a well-known actor-dancer and the father of Harry and Fred Payne, regulars at the Gaiety who portrayed Preposteros and Stupidas in Thespis. See Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in Gilbert and Sullivan News (London) Spring 2003. A heading in the libretto, \\"Chorus and Ballet\\", attaches it to the last section of the finale but does not indicate how it figured in the plot. Most press accounts placed it at about this point, although some placed it slightly earlier in the act. At some performances, the ballet was performed in Act I, but it was certainly in Act II on opening night, and it seems finally to have settled there.Rees, pp. 68‚Äì70 In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett discovered the ballet from Act II of Thespis. Two of the five movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", were found together with the surviving performance materials for Sullivan's 1864 ballet, L'√éle Enchant√©e. Another section was found in the material for his 1897 ballet, Victoria and Merrie England. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: a dragon costume, used nowhere in the libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the harp visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety's orchestra. Movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in Sullivan's other ballets,Tillett 1998, pp. 28‚Äì34. and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD. Sullivan tended to re- use his ballet music. Of the five movements that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) is not known to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in L'√éle Enchant√©e. Two of those, and one other, were eventually re-used in Victoria and Merrie England. One was also used in his incidental music to Macbeth.Tillett 1998, p. 34. Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of The Mikado in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the Thespis ballet was almost certainly the music that Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing The Gondoliers he is unlikely to have written something original.Tillett 1998, pp. 35‚Äì37. Text Even the version of the libretto printed in 1911 is not free of sloppy editing. Note the line \\"He's you're brother\\". The surviving libretto is not the version heard by audiences at the Gaiety Theatre. There are numerous discrepancies between the original libretto and what was described as happening on stage, and reviewers repeatedly quoted dialogue that has no equivalent in the published libretto. At least one song is missing,Rees, pp. 67‚Äì68 and an entire character, Venus, is mentioned in at least five reviews as stout, elderly, and heavily made-up; she does not appear in the libretto but was listed in the first night programme. Stage directions in the original are slip-shod: characters reappear without an entrance being noted,Rees, p. 46 or enter twice in quick succession, without having exited.Rees, pp. 56‚Äì57 In addition, Sullivan told his mother that at least one song was cut after opening night, and there must certainly have been other cuts, given the undue length of the first performance. But the text of the libretto, as published, remained \\"virtually unchanged\\" between December 1871 and March 1872.Allen (First Night), p. 26 In a letter to Percy Strzelecki on 23 April 1890, Gilbert apologised for the condition of the libretto. He wrote, \\"I was in the United States when it was published & I had no opportunity of correcting proofs. This will explain the presence of innumerable typographical & other errors.\\" But several scholars conclude that Gilbert must have been remembering a trip the following year, as in the fall of 1871 it \\"would have been impossible for Gilbert to travel to America and back in time for rehearsals of Thespis.\\"Ainger, p. 93; see also Allen (First Night), p. 26; Rees, pp. 90‚Äì91 Even after the first printing, there does not seem to have been any effort to correct the errors: There were four separate issues of the libretto between December and March, but no corrections were made. Gilbert's final disposition of the libretto came in 1911, when it was included in the fourth volume of his Original Plays.W. S. Gilbert, Original Plays, Fourth Series, London: Chatto & Windus (1911), pp. 443‚Äì75 However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few spelling mistakes.Rees, pp. 90‚Äì94 Musical numbers The music is known to survive for numbers shown in bold; a ballet also survives, but its location in the order of musical numbers is uncertain. Reviews of the opera hint at three additional numbers not in the libretto, but as their names and exact locations are unknown, they are not listed.Rees, pp. 67‚Äì69 ;Act I thumb *\\"Throughout the night, the constellations\\" (Women's Chorus, with Solo) *\\"Oh, I'm the celestial drudge\\" (Mercury) *\\"Oh incident unprecedented\\" (Mercury, Mars, Apollo, Diana, and Jupiter) *\\"Here far away from all the world\\" (Sparkeion and Nicemis) *\\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" (Chorus with Solos) *Picnic WaltzRees, p. 36 and footnote 3, p. 96 *\\"I once knew a chap who discharged a function\\" (Thespis) *Act I Finale: \\"So that's arranged ‚Äì you take my place, my boy\\" (Ensemble) ;Act II *\\"Of all symposia\\" (Sillimon and Chorus) *\\"Little maid of Arcadee\\" (Sparkeion) *\\"Olympus is now in a terrible muddle\\" (Mercury) *\\"You're Diana.

It is situated just south of the boundary between the watersheds of the Shannon and the Erne, at the point where the N55 national secondary road and the R194 regional road meet. History The town has been a centre of population since Celtic times, probably because of its elevated position offering a view over the surrounding countryside. It is mentioned in the ancient Irish epic, the T√°in B√≥ Cuailgne, as being one of the places where Queen Medb and her army stopped on their journey to take the Donn Cuailnge (the Brown Bull of Cooley). The name of the town is itself so ancient as to be unclear even in Irish; the 11th-century writers of the Lebor na hUidre (containing the oldest written version of the T√°in) refer to it by means of a gloss as \\"Gr√°nairud Tethba tuaiscirt .i. Gr√°nard indiu\\" (\\"Gr√°nairud of northern Teathbha, i.e. Gr√°nard of today\\"). According to the Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick, Patrick appointed Guasacht, a son of his former master Milch√∫, as first bishop of Granard, but the diocese did not survive as a separate entity. The surname Sheridan was first recorded in Granard in the 8th century. Granard Motte Granard is known for the motte built by Riste√°rd de Ti√∫it. It stands 166 m (543 ft) above sea level, located at the head of the town. A statue of St Patrick was erected on the motte in 1932 to commemorate the 1500th anniversary of the coming of the saint to Ireland for the second time.Lehane, Brendan (2001) The Companion Guide to Ireland; rev. ed. Woodbridge: Companion Guides ; pp. 101-02 Due to the location between the three rivers and near Lough Sheelin, it is also a centre for trout and coarse fishing. The Gaynors (Mag Fhionbharra, from Fionnbharr √ì G√©aradh√°inhttp://www.sloinne.ie/surname/en/gaynor/) were once the Gaelic lords of Granard. Granard was the location of an annual Harp festival from 1781 to 1785. This had been due to the financial support of James Dungan, an Irish merchant then residing in Copenhagen, and a native of Granard, who had heard of similar events being organised in Scotland. Many of the harpists who won prizes at these festivals, including Charles Fanning, Arthur O'Neill, and Rose Mooney went on to perform at the Belfast Harp Festival in July 1792. There has been a revival of the festival since 1981. During the Irish War of Independence, on 31 October 1920 a police officer, District-Inspector Philip Kelleher was shot dead by two masked men in the bar of the Greville Arms Hotel, Granard. As a reprisal, a motor convoy of Crown forces entered the town four days later and systematically destroyed some of the main business premises of the town.Anglo-Celt, Saturday, November 13, 1920 Transport Granard is within the catchment area for Edgeworthstown railway station.

There is also a small breeding population in Turkey. These cranes are migratory birds. Birds from western Eurasia will spend the winter in Africa whilst the birds from Asia, Mongolia and China will spend the winter in the Indian subcontinent. The bird is symbolically significant in the culture of India and Pakistan, where it is known as Koonj.  Description  Individual from Tal Chhapar Sanctuary, Churu, Rajasthan The demoiselle is long, tall and has a wingspan. It weighs . It is the smallest species of crane.Demoiselle Crane, Int. Crane Foundation The demoiselle crane is slightly smaller than the common crane but has similar plumage. It has a long white neck stripe and the black on the foreneck extends down over the chest in a plume. It has a loud trumpeting call, higher-pitched than the common crane. Like other cranes it has a dancing display, more balletic than the common crane, with less leaping. The demoiselle was so named by Queen Marie Antoinette, for its delicate and maiden-like appearance.  Behaviour and ecology  Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden The demoiselle crane lives in a variety of different environments, including desert areas and numerous types of grasslands (flooded, mountain, temperate and tropical grassland) which are often within a few hundred metres of streams or lakes. However, when nesting, they prefer patchy areas of vegetation which is tall enough to conceal them and their nests, yet short enough to allow them look out for predators whilst incubating their eggs. Demoiselle cranes have to take one of the toughest migrations in the world. In late August through September, they gather in flocks of up to 400 individuals and prepare for their flight to their winter range. During their migratory flight south, demoiselles fly like all cranes, with their head and neck straight forward and their feet and legs straight behind, reaching altitudes of . Along their arduous journey they have to cross the Himalayan mountains to get to their over-wintering grounds in India. Many die from fatigue, hunger and predation from golden eagles. Simpler, lower routes are possible, such as crossing the range via the Khyber Pass. However, their presently preferred route has been hard-wired by countless cycles of migration. At their wintering grounds, demoiselles have been observed flocking with common cranes, their combined totals reaching up to 20,000 individuals. Demoiselles maintain separate social groups within the larger flock. In March and April, they begin their long spring journey back to their northern nesting grounds. In Khichan, Rajasthan in India, villagers feed the cranes on their migration and these large congregations have become an annual spectacle. The demoiselle crane is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African- Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. In culture Demoiselle cranes (Grus virgo) in Jodhpur Bishnoi's Village, Rajasthan, India The demoiselle crane is known as the Koonj (‡§ï‡•Ç‡§Ç‡§ú, ⁄©ŸàŸÜÿ¨, ‡®ï‡©Ç‡©∞‡®ú) in the languages of North India, and figure prominently in the literature, poetry and idiom of the region. Beautiful women are often compared to the koonj because its long and thin shape is considered graceful. Metaphorical references are also often made to the koonj for people who have ventured far from home or undertaken hazardous journeys. Demoiselle cranes at Khichan, Rajasthan India The name koonj is derived from the Sanskrit word kraunch, which is a cognate Indo- European term for crane itself. In the mythology of Valmiki, the composer of the Hindu epic Ramayana, it is claimed that his first verse was inspired by the sight of a hunter kill the male of a pair of demoiselle cranes that were courting. Observing the lovelorn female circling and crying in grief, he cursed the hunter in verse. Since tradition held that all poetry prior to this moment had been revealed rather than created by man, this verse concerning the demoiselle cranes is regarded as the first human-composed meter. The flying formation of the koonj during migrations also inspired infantry formations in ancient India. The Mahabharata epic describes both warring sides adopting the koonj formation on the second day of the Kurukshetra War.

The enzyme causes negative supercoiling of the DNA or relaxes positive supercoils. It does so by looping the template so as to form a crossing, then cutting one of the double helices and passing the other through it before releasing the break, changing the linking number by two in each enzymatic step. This process occurs in bacteria, whose single circular DNA is cut by DNA gyrase and the two ends are then twisted around each other to form supercoils. Gyrase is also found in eukaryotic plastids: it has been found in the apicoplast of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and in chloroplasts of several plants. Bacterial DNA gyrase is the target of many antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, novobiocin, and ciprofloxacin. The unique ability of gyrase to introduce negative supercoils into DNA at the expense of ATP hydrolysis is what allows bacterial DNA to have free negative supercoils. The ability of gyrase to relax positive supercoils comes into play during DNA replication and prokaryotic transcription. The helical nature of the DNA causes positive supercoils to accumulate ahead of a translocating enzyme, in the case of DNA replication, a DNA polymerase. The ability of gyrase (and topoisomerase IV) to relax positive supercoils allows superhelical tension ahead of the polymerase to be released so that replication can continue. Gyrase structure Scheme of gyrase structure DNA gyrase is a tetrameric enzyme that consists of 2 GyrA (\\"A\\") and 2 GyrB (\\"B\\") subunits Vanden Broeck, A., Lotz, C., Ortiz, J. et al. Cryo-EM structure of the complete E. coli DNA gyrase nucleoprotein complex. Nat Commun 10, 4935 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12914-y. Structurally the complex is formed by 3 pairs of \\"gates\\", sequential opening and closing of which results into the direct transfer of DNA segment and introduction of 2 negative supercoils. N-gates are formed by ATPase domains of GyrB subunits. Binding of 2 ATP molecules leads to dimerization and, therefore, closing of the gates. Hydrolysis, on the contrary, opens them. DNA cleavage and reunion is performed by a catalytic center located in DNA-gates build by all gyrase subunits. C-gates are formed by GyrA subunits. Mechanochemical model of gyrase activity DNA gyrase catalytic cycle A single molecule studyGore J, Bryant Z, Stone MD, Nollmann M, Cozzarelli NR, Bustamante C, \\"Mechanochemical Analysis of DNA Gyrase Using Rotor Bead Tracking\\", Nature 2006 Jan 5 (Vol. 439): 100-104. has characterized gyrase activity as a function of DNA tension (applied force) and ATP, and proposed a mechanochemical model. Upon binding to DNA (the \\"Gyrase-DNA\\" state), there is a competition between DNA wrapping and dissociation, where increasing DNA tension increases the probability of dissociation. According to the catalytic cycle proposed, binding of 2 ATP molecules causes dimerization of ATPase domains of GyrB subunits and capturing of a T-segment of DNA (T- from transferring) in a cavity between GyrB subunits. On a next step the enzyme cleaves a G-segment of DNA (G- from gate) making a double-strand break. Then the T-segment is transferred through the break, which is accompanied by the hydrolysis of the first ATP molecule. DNA- gyrase ligates the break in a G-segment back and T-segment finally leaves the enzyme complex. Hydrolysis of the second ATP returns the system to the initial step of a cycle. As the result of a catalytic cycle two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed and two negative supercoils are introduced into the DNA template. The number of superhelical turns introduced into an initially relaxed circular DNA has been calculated to be approximately equal to the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed by gyrase Therefore, it can be suggested that two ATP molecules are hydrolyzed per cycle of reaction by gyrase, leading to the introduction of a linking difference of -2. Gyrase specificity Gyrase has a pronounced specificity to DNA substrates. Strong gyrase binding sites (SGS) were found in some phages (bacteriophage Mu group) and plasmids (pSC101, pBR322). Recently, high throughput mapping of DNA gyrase sites in the Escherichia coli genome using Topo-Seq approach revealed a long (‚âà130 bp) and degenerate binding motif that can explain the existence of SGSs. The gyrase motif reflects wrapping of DNA around the enzyme complex and DNA flexibility. It contains two periodic regions in which GC-rich islands are alternated with AT-rich patches by a period close to the period of DNA double helix (‚âà10.5 bp). The two regions correspond to DNA binding by C-terminal domains of GyrA subunits and resemble eukaryotic nucleosome binding motif. Inhibition by antibiotics Gyrase is present in prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, but the enzymes are not entirely similar in structure or sequence, and have different affinities for different molecules. This makes gyrase a good target for antibiotics. Two classes of antibiotics that inhibit gyrase are: #The aminocoumarins (including novobiocin and Coumermycin A1). Aminocoumarins work by competitive inhibition of energy transduction of DNA gyrase by binding to the ATPase active site located on the GyrB subunitArnaud Vanden Broeck, Alastair G. McEwen, Yassmine Chebaro, No√´lle Potier, and Val√©rie Lamour. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2019 62 (8), 4225-4231. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01928Lamour, V.; Hoermann, L.; Jeltsch, J.

By binding to the enzyme they trap it on a transient step of a catalytic cycle preventing the reunion of a G-segment. This results in an accumulation of double-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks and cell death. Quinolone-resistant bacteria frequently harbor mutated topoisomerases that resist quinolone binding. The subunit A is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as oxolinic and nalidixic acids. The subunit B is selectively inactivated by antibiotics such as coumermycin A1 and novobiocin. Inhibition of either subunit blocks supertwisting activity.

He was killed in action during the First World War. Early life Kelly, the fourth son and seventh child of Irish-born woolbroker Thomas Herbert Kelly and his native-born wife Mary Anne, n√©e Dick, was born in 1881 at 47 Phillip Street, Sydney. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, then went with his family to England and educated at Eton College, where he stroked the school eight to victory in the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta in 1899. Kelly studied music at Eton under Charles Harford Lloyd, and was awarded a Lewis Nettleship musical scholarship at Oxford in 1899. At Balliol College, Oxford (BA, 1903; MA, 1912) he was mentored by Donald Tovey and became president of the university musical club and a leading spirit at the Sunday evening concerts at Balliol.Latham, Christopher.

Oxford lost the race by 6 lengths. Kelly went on to win the Diamond sculls at Henley again that summer, beating Julius Beresford in the final. He also won the Wingfield Sculls, the Amateur Championship of the Thames, beating the holder Arthur Cloutte. This was the only occasion on which he entered.Wingfield Sculls Record of Races. rowingservice.com On leaving Oxford in 1903 he starting rowing at Leander Club and was in the Leander crews which won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1903, 1904 and 1905 and the Stewards' Challenge Cup in 1906. In 1905 he again won the Diamond sculls, beating Harry Blackstaffe. His time on this occasion 8 min. 10 sec. stood as a record for over 30 years. Kelly's last appearance in a racing boat was in 1908, when he competed at the London Olympic Games. He was a member of the Leander crew in the eights, which won the gold medal for Great Britain.Frederick Kelly . Sports Reference Olympic Sports Contemporary reports of Kelly's oarsmanship were glowing: 'his natural sense of poise and rhythm made his boat a live thing under him'; 'Many think [Kelly] the greatest amateur stylist of all time'.Hylton Cleaver (1956) A History of Rowing, p. 48  Hands and arms  In 1907 Kelly became worried about problems with his hands and arms that were impeding his performance, especially as a musician. He also developed a facial tic. He sought hypnotherapeutic treatment for this condition from J. Milne Bramwell, the specialist medical hypnotist, in London. He attended Bramwell's rooms for treatment over an extended time. Life after Oxford After leaving Oxford with fourth-class honours in history, Kelly studied the piano under Iwan Knorr at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, alongside members of the Frankfurt Group. On his return to London in 1908 he acted as an adviser to the Classical Concert Society and used his influence in favour of the recognition of modern composers. At this time he met and became a close friend of Leonard Borwick, probably England's finest pianist at the time. In 1911 he visited Sydney and gave some concerts, and in 1912 took part in chamber music concerts in London. He performed with Pablo Casals, and he helped organise a concert in London by Maurice Ravel, on 17 December 1913 at the Bechstein Hall. Following the outbreak of war in 1914, Kelly was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve for service with the Royal Naval Division with his friends‚Äîthe poet Rupert Brooke, the critic and composer William Denis Browne, and others of what became known as the Latin Club. Kelly was wounded twice at Gallipoli, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and reached the rank of lieutenant-commander. At Gallipoli he wrote his scores in his tent at base camp, including his tribute to Brooke, Elegy for String Orchestra: \\"In Memoriam Rupert Brooke\\" (1915), conceived in the wake of Brooke's death. Kelly was among the party who buried him on Skyros. The following is a description of Kelly's close connection to Brooke, taken from Race Against Time: the Diaries of F.S.

During a practice exercise, an F-86 fighter plane collided with the B-47 bomber carrying the bomb. To protect the aircrew from a possible detonation in the event of a crash, the bomb was jettisoned. Following several unsuccessful searches, the bomb was presumed lost somewhere in Wassaw Sound off the shores of Tybee Island.  Midair collision  The B-47 bomber was on a simulated combat mission from Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. It was carrying a single bomb. At about 2:00 a.m., an F-86 fighter collided with the B-47. The F-86 crashed after the pilot ejected from the plane. The damaged B-47 remained airborne, plummeting from when Colonel Richardson regained flight control.Boeing B-47 StratojetBBC News, Missing for 50 years ‚Äì US nuclear bomb (June 22, 2009) The crew requested permission to jettison the bomb, in order to reduce weight and prevent the bomb from exploding during an emergency landing. Permission was granted, and the bomb was jettisoned at while the bomber was traveling at about . The crew did not see an explosion when the bomb struck the sea. They managed to land the B-47 safely at the nearest base, Hunter Air Force Base. The pilot, Colonel Howard Richardson, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross after this incident.  The bomb  Some sources describe the bomb as a functional nuclear weapon, but others describe it as disabled. If it had a plutonium nuclear core installed, it was a fully functional weapon. If it had a dummy core installed, it was incapable of producing a nuclear explosion but could still produce a conventional explosion. The 12-foot (4 m) long Mark 15 bomb weighs and bears the serial number 47782. It contains of conventional high explosives and highly enriched uranium. The Air Force maintains that its nuclear capsule, used to initiate the nuclear reaction, was removed before its flight aboard B-47. As noted in the Atomic Energy Commission \\"Form AL-569 Temporary Custodian Receipt (for maneuvers)\\", signed by the aircraft commander, the bomb contained a simulated 150-pound cap made of lead.The Nuclear Information Project , Form AL-569, \\"Temporary Custodian Receipt (for maneuvers),\\" to U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Albuquerque Operations, from James W. Twitty, Col., U.S. Air Force, February 4, 1958. Released under FOIA. (PDF) However, according to 1966 Congressional testimony by Assistant Secretary of Defense W.J. Howard, the Tybee Island bomb was a \\"complete weapon, a bomb with a nuclear capsule\\" and one of two weapons lost that contained a plutonium trigger.CounterPunch.org, When We Almost Nuked Savannah: The Case of the Missing H-Bomb (May 15, 2009) NPR Media, Letter of W.J. Howard, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense (Atomic Energy), to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Congress of the United States (April 22, 1966). (PDF) Page 1, Page2. Nevertheless, a study of the Strategic Air Command documents indicates that Alert Force test flights in February 1958 with the older Mark 15 payloads were not authorized to fly with nuclear capsules on board. Such approval was pending deployment of safer \\"sealed-pit nuclear capsule\\" weapons, which did not begin deployment until June 1958.The Nuclear Information Project, History of the Strategic Air Command January 1, 1958 ‚Äì June 30, 1958. Released under FOIA. (PDF)  Recovery efforts  Starting on February 6, 1958, the Air Force 2700th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Squadron and 100 Navy personnel equipped with hand-held sonar and galvanic drag and cable sweeps mounted a search. On April 16, the military announced the search had been unsuccessful. Based on a hydrologic survey, the bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried under 5 to 15 feet (2 to 5 m) of silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound. In 2004, retired Air Force Lt. Colonel Derek Duke claimed to have narrowed the possible resting spot of the bomb down to a small area approximately the size of a football field. He and his partner located the area by trawling in their boat with a Geiger counter in tow. Secondary radioactive particles four times naturally occurring levels were detected and mapped, and the site of radiation origination triangulated. Subsequent investigations found the source of the radiation was natural, originating from monazite deposits.Lost H-bomb:RIP  Ongoing concerns  As of 2007, no undue levels of unnatural radioactive contamination have been detected in the regional Upper Floridan aquifer by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (over and above the already high levels thought to be due to monazite, a locally occurring mineral that is naturally radioactive).America's Lost H Bomb , Discovery's Science Channel documentary about the Tybee Bomb (2007)Chatham County Public Works and Park Services, Drinking Water Quality Consumer Confidence Report (2007) In popular culture In February 2015, a satirical news site ran an article stating that the bomb was found by vacationing Canadian divers and that the bomb had since been removed from the bay. The fake story spread widely via social media. The collision and its aftermath also drives the plot of the novel, Three Chords & The Truth, by Craig McDonald published in November 2016.

Its sandy beach, tourist campsite, and golf course all attract visitors. As of 2017, local man David McGowan had begun construction of a \\"glamping\\" village, with the main focus being the Boeing 767 he bought to convert into accommodation. The area around Enniscrone includes the townlands of Muckduff, Lacken, Lacknaslevia, Frankford, Carrowhubbock South and Carrowhubbock North. Name The majority of the local population know this village as Enniscrone, though many local school teachers and historians use the official name of \\"Inishcrone\\". Sligo County Council has neglected the official version in favour of \\"Enniscrone\\" which appears on their website, and at least one local newspaper does not use the official name. Locally, the road signs are one of the few places \\"Inniscrone\\" can be seen. Up until the late 1970s the name \\"Enniscrone\\" was used by local teachers. It was taught as being a derivative of the Irish Inis Eascar Abhann, meaning \\"the island on the sandbank in the river\\". An entry in the Placenames Database of Ireland suggests that there is no evidence for this derivation, and notes that the name may derive from Eiscir Abhann, meaning \\"esker of the river\\". Enniscrone beach Enniscrone strand Enniscrone's public sandy beach stretches over a long area of shoreline, and is split near the lower part of the village by a small crossable river. Part of the beach is overseen by lifeguards in the summer period. The \\"Valley of Diamonds\\" is one of the hidden features along the beach, and is the largest of the \\"volcano- like\\" compositions among the long-grassed sand dunes. It is located near the end of the beach. Sligo County Council fenced off the sand dunes as part of their \\"Dune Restoration Works Programme\\". New county council restrictions limit road access to the beach, a measure taken to comply with regulations for Enniscrone's Blue Flag beach.

He was also a critic, teacher and academic. He was referred to in an American journal as \\"the 20th century's greatest 18th-century poet\\". Life Hope was born in Cooma, New South Wales. His father was a Presbyterian minister and his mother a teacher.Gia Metherell, Obituary: \\"Poet, teacher and fearless civiliser\\". The Canberra Times, 14 July 2000, p. 13 He was educated partly at home and in Tasmania, where they moved in 1911. Three years later they moved to Sydney. He attended Fort Street High School, the University of Sydney, and then the University of Oxford on a scholarship. Returning to Australia in 1931 he then trained as a teacher, and spent some time drifting. He worked as a psychologist with the New South Wales Department of Labour and Industry, and as a lecturer in Education and English at Sydney Teachers' College (1937‚Äì44). He was a lecturer at the University of Melbourne from 1945 to 1950, and in 1951 became the first professor of English at the newly founded Canberra University College, later of the Australian National University (ANU) when the two institutions merged. At the ANU he and Tom Inglis Moore created the first full year course in Australian literature at an Australian university. He retired from the ANU in 1968 and was appointed Emeritus Professor. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1972 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1981 and awarded many other honours. He died in Canberra, having suffered dementia in his last years, and is buried at the Queanbeyan Lawn Cemetery. Poet and critic Although he was published as a poet while still young, The Wandering Islands (1955) was his first collection and all that remained of his early work after most of his manuscripts were destroyed in a fire. Its publication was delayed by concern about the effects of Hope's highly-erotic and savagely-satirical verse on the Australian public. His frequent allusions to sexuality in his work caused Douglas Stewart to dub him \\"Phallic Alec\\" in a letter to Norman Lindsay.Geoffrey Dutton, \\"The final word\\" (written in 1991, before his death), Sydney Morning Herald, 15 July 2000, p. 33 His influences were Pope and the Augustan poets, Auden, and Yeats. He was a polymath, very largely self-taught, and with a talent for offending his countrymen. He wrote a book of \\"answers\\" to other poems, including one in response to the poem \\"To His Coy Mistress\\" by Andrew Marvell. The reviews he wrote in the 1940s and '50s were feared \\"for their acidity and intelligence. If his reviews hurt some writers ‚Äì Patrick White included ‚Äì they also sharply raised the standard of literary discussion in Australia.\\"Hart (2008) However, Hope relaxed in later years. As poet Kevin Hart writes, \\"The man I knew, from 1973 to 2000, was invariably gracious and benevolent\\". Hope wrote in a letter to the poet and academic Catherine Cole: \\"Now I feel I've reached the pinnacle of achievement when you equate me with one of Yeats's 'wild, wicked old men'. I'm probably remarkably wicked but not very wild, I fear too much ingrained Presbyterian caution\\".cited by Hart (2008) Cole suggests that Hope represented the three attributes that Vladimir Nabokov believed essential in a writer, \\"storyteller, teacher, enchanter\\". Hope's editor and fellow critic was David Brooks who was responsible for posthumously publishing the Selected Poetry and Prose of AD Hope in January, 2000.https://www.readings.com.au/products/704527/a-d-hope-selected-poetry-and- prose Influence and impact Kevin Hart, reviewing Catherine Cole's memoir of Hope, writes that \\"When A. D. Hope died in 2000 at the age of 93, Australia lost its greatest living poet\\". Hart goes on to say that when once asked what poets could do for Australia, Hope replied \\"oh not much, merely justify its existence\\". In 1998 a celebration of his life and works, The Scythe Honed Fine, was published by the National Library of Australia. Private life In 1937 he married Penelope Robinson. They had a daughter, Emily, who predeceased her parents in 1979; and two sons, Andrew and Geoffrey, who survived him. Penelope died in 1988.

History =Early history= The region came under the influence of the Nanda Empire of ancient India from 300 BCE, and with the rise of Chandragupta Maurya, the region came under the complete control of the Mauryan Empire. Afterward, the region was briefly and nominally controlled by the Shunga Empire. However, with the decline of the Shungas, the region passed to local Hindu and Buddhist rulers, and interrupted by foreign rulers. Many of these foreign rulers, like the Indo-Parthians, Sakas, and Kushans converted to Hinduism and Buddhism, and promoted these Indian religions throughout Central and South Asia. The region reached its height under the Buddhist ruler Kanishka the Great. After the fall of the Kushans, the region came under the control of the Gupta Empire of ancient India. During the period, Hindu and Buddhist art and architecture flourished in the area.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Ancient_Pakistan/R4jiAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&dq;=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi&printsec;=frontcover With the decline of the imperial Guptas, the Hindu Shahis came to rule the area.

Durrani considered it wise to rule the area through local tribal chiefs, especially the Tareen chiefs who remained the main administrators from around the 1760s to 1818/1819.Dr SB Panni 'Tarikh i Hazara' Peshawar 1969 The Durranis' rule ended abruptly in the beginning of the 19th century, circa 1819 or 1820, with the advent of the Sikhs. =Sikh annexation= The Sikhs annexed Hazara in two stages: first, Lower Hazara was annexed when the Sikhs under Makhan Singh took over the plains, on the invitation of a Turk chieftain, who betrayed his country to save himself.Hazara District Gazetteer 1883-84, Lahore, 1884, pp 23-24 Upper Hazara suffered a similar fate when the Sikhs took Kashmir from the Barakzai Afghans in 1819.Nalwa, V. (2009), Hari Singh Nalwa ‚Äî Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, pp. 77-104, . The town of Haripur (meaning 'Hari's town') was founded in 1822 by Hari Singh Nalwa, the Commander-in-Chief of Ranjit Singh's army. On the successful completion of his tenure as governor of Kashmir in 1821, Pakhli and Damtaur were bestowed upon Nalwa as a jagir. Tanolis were the greater threat to Sikhs. Painda Khan Tanoli defeated Ranjit Singh near Tarbeela .As soon as Nalwa received this grant, he built the walled town of Haripur in the heart of the Haripur plain, centered on the fort of Harkishan Garh, which he encircled with a deep trench. The site selected had seen some of the fiercest fighting between Sikhs and Afghans.Panni, 1969 Despite the presence of the fort and a strong Sikh garrison, the Lahore government wasn't finally able to get full control of the Lower Hazara until they had defeated and captured and executed the Tareen chiefs and warriors like Muhammad Khan, Bostan Khan, and some others.Hazara Gazetteer 1883-84, p. 26 =British India= The presence of the fort at Harkishangarh, with its four-yard thick and 16-yard high wall, eventually brought a feeling of security to the region. In 1835, Baron Heugel, a German traveler found only remnants of that wall remaining.Nalwa, V. (2009), Hari Singh Nalwa ‚Äî Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, pp. 224-5, . Haripur was the sole example of a planned town in this region until the British built Abbottabad many years later. It continued to grow, eventually becoming a city and later a district. Haripur once bore the official name of Haripur Hazara and was the capital of Hazara until 1853, when the new capital Abbottabad was built. In March 1849, the Punjab was annexed by the British Indian Empire.

It exists in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and some parts of India. It is officially banned and designated as an international terrorist organisation by the United States, Canada,[Cold Terror: How Canada Nurtures and Exports Terrorism Around the World, Stewart Bell, John Wiley & Sons, 2008. ] the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and India. It gained notoriety for killing 329 civilians (mostly Canadians) in Air India Flight 182 and for the 1985 Narita International Airport bombing. Despite the killing of innocent people, as the case is with most terrorist organisations, its supporters promote it as a resistance movement. BKI was created in 1978 after clashes with the Nirankari sect of Sikhs. It was active throughout the 1980s in the Punjab insurgency, though its influence declined in the 1990s after several of its senior leaders were killed in encounters with Indian police. Creation The name Babbar Khalsa is taken from the Babbar Akali Movement of 1920, which fought against the British Rule of India. The modern-day Babbar Khalsa was created in 1978 by Talwinder Singh Parmar and Jathedar Sukhdev Singh Babbar as an offshoot of Akhand Kirtani Jatha with the support of Bibi Amarjit Kaur. After a bloody clash on April 13, 1978, between a group of Amritdhari Sikhs of Akhand Kirtani Jatha and a gathering of the rival Nirankari sect, BKI was founded for justice. On 13 April 1978, the day to celebrate the birth of Khalsa, a peaceful Sant Nirankari convention was organized in Amritsar to start a new religion with the concept of panj pyarre as sath sitare, with permission from the Akali state government. The practices of \\"Sant Nirankaris\\" sect of Nirankaris were considered heresy as the act was intentionally political motivated to hurt the Sikh sentiments, and was opposed by Sikh orthodox leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. From Golden Temple premises, Bhindranwale delivered an angry sermon in which he declared that he would not allow this convention and would go there and cut them to pieces. A procession of about two hundred Sikhs led by Bhindranwale and Fauja Singh of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha left the Golden Temple, heading towards the Nirankari Convention. Fauja attempted to behead Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh with his sword but was shot dead by Gurbachan's bodyguard. In the ensuing violence, several people were killed: two of Bhindranwale's followers, eleven members of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and three Nirankaris. This event brought Bhindranwale to limelight in the media. A criminal case was filed against sixty-two Nirankaris, by the Akali led government in Punjab. The case was heard in the neighbouring Haryana state, and all the accused were acquitted. The Punjab government Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal decided not to appeal the decision.Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues with Sikh Militants, Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996, pp. 58‚Äì60; Gopal Singh, A History of the Sikh People, New Delhi, World Book Center, 1988, p. 739. The case of Nirankaris received widespread support in the Indian media and the orthodox Sikhs knew this to be a conspiracy to defame demoralize the Sikh religion. Bhindranwale increased his rhetoric against the injustice of Sikhs. A letter of authority was issued by Akal Takht to boycott the Sant Nirankaris. The chief proponents of this attitude were Babbar Khalsa founded by Talwinder Singh Parmar and followers of the widow, Bibi Amarjit Kaur of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, whose husband Fauja Singh had been at the head of the march in Amritsar; the Damdami Taksal led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who had also been in Amritsar on the day; the Dal Khalsa, formed with the object of wanting a Sikh state fundamental rights; and the All India Sikh Students Federation, which was banned by the government. Babbar Khalsa started to defy and go against people who caused the defilement of women, children, men, and the elderly; within the minor religions and lower castes in India. In the subsequent years following this event, murders took place in Punjab and the surrounding areas supposedly by Bhindranwale's group and the new Babbar Khalsa. The Babbar Khalsa activists took up residence in the Golden Temple. In 1984 from the 1st - 8th of June, the Indian Army executed a mass slaughter, ordered by Indira Gandhi (Prime Minister of India at the time,) to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale (who fought for Justice for Sikhs and the minoroties persecuted in India.) But rather than aiming to remove the Individuals targetted, the Indian army the military entered the temple complex and mass-murdered hundreds and thousands of Sikh civilians; including pregnant women, newborns and children. Estimates state that above 5000 people were killed, however, the official death count from officials is 492 - the number of casualties is most definitely unknown. On 24 April 1980, the Nirankari head, Gurbachan was killed. A member of the Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Ranjit Singh, surrendered and admitted to the assassination three years later, and was sentenced to serve thirteen years at the Tihar Jail in Delhi. According to C. Christine Fair, Babbar Khalsa was opposed to Bhindranwale, and his cause for justice, but rather more concerned with propagating violence than supporting Khalistan movement. Objective The group wants to establish an independent country for Sikh religion called Khalistan, and uses bombings, kidnappings and murders to accomplish their goals. The sacred places of worship of Hindus have been desecrated by Babbar Khalsa. Although mentioned as objective, Babbar Khalsa were not hugely motivated in the idea of Khalistan but enforcing code of behavior. In order to achieve compliance, the group often used violence including murders. Financing The group receives funds and support from the Sikh diaspora located in Europe and North America. Historically, to get the financial and material support needed for opprating terrorist activities BKI has used in-person meetings, public rallies and fundraising events. Parmer organized and featured at Sikh rallies and fundraisers across Canada. Parmar was instrumental in channeling financial support to BKI from overseas Sikh communities. Presence The BKI have their presence outside of India in Pakistan, North America, Europe and Scandinavia. BKI at present is active in the US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, France, Germany, Norway, Switzerland and Pakistan. BKI continues its operations from Pakistan with the support of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The group has its headquarters in Lahore, Pakistan. In 1992, Talwinder Singh Parmar split from the BKI and formed the Babbar Khalsa (Parmar) faction. This happened after serious differences erupted between Parmar and BKI's leadership. The Parmar faction has a presence in the UK, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. =Links with other organizations= Babbar Khalsa is part of a terrorist network sponsored by Germany-based terrorist groups and ISI with plans to revive terrorism in the Indian Punjab. In August 2001, it was reported that a joint committee was formed in Germany that aims to coordinate the activities of major terrorist organisations abroad. Resham Singh of Babbar Khalsa, Gurdial Singh Lalli of the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) and Harmeet Singh of Kamagata Maru Dal of Khalistan are the prominent leaders of this committee. The ISI supported the coordination between Khalistani terrorists, terrorists operating in Jammu and Kashmir and other fundamentalist groups. The Pakistani government appointed Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Javed Nasir, who was a former chief of the ISI, to serve as the Chairman of Pakistan Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (PGPC). PGPC formed in 1999, administers Sikh shrines in Pakistan. According to intelligence reports, the terrorists camps for Sikhs in Pakistan are working under the supervision of General Nasir. In April 2002 it was reported in media that the ISI has entrusted the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) with the task of reviving terrorism in Punjab. The LeT will be imparting arms training to groups like the BKI, the ISYF and the Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF). LeT opened at least eight camps in Pakistan to train the Khalistanis. These camps are located at Kot Lakhpat, Chakwal, Gujranwala, Mianwali, Peshawar, Attock, Shahidan Da Banga and Gulbarg in Lahore. BKI has also established a nexus with Dawood Ibrahim, the fugitive Indian underworld kingpin who now resides in Karachi. The terrorists were liasoning with the Dawood Ibrahim gang in Mumbai. The terrorists would dispose of stolen cars and trucks through the Dawood gang to amass money, which was then sent to Wadhwa Singh for procuring arms and ammunition. Efforts were made by the ISI to help the BKI establish bases in China, but these initiatives were thwarted by the Chinese. In February 2004, India had initiated efforts to secure the return of Mehal Singh from Paris, France. He was one of the two principal leaders of the group. In late 2003 he had left for France from Pakistan. His differences with Wadhwa Singh had led to his move. Wadhwa Singh's son-in-law Satnam Singh Malian operates from Germany. =Banned= It is officially banned and designated as an international terrorist organisation by several countries. *Canada banned the group in 2003. *European Union *India. *Japan *Malaysiahttp://www.moha.gov.my/images/maklumat_bahagian/KK/kdndomestic.pdf *United Kingdom *United States, In April 2004, the United States added BKI and the ISYF, to its terror list, allowing the US to deny entry (and to deport) any of its members. Activities Babbar Khalsa kept up a low level of activity until 1983. Its membership was drawn from ex-servicemen, police officers, and Sikh religious organisations. Some terrorists acts done in Canada, India and Germany have been claimed in the name of Babbar Khalsa. During his residence in Canada, Parmar continued to lead BKI activities. He was involved in terror financing, recruitment and radicalization of Sikh youths, procurement of small arms and explosives, and the development and coordination of terrorist attacks. After Operation Blue Star the organisation fell into disarray but was able to regroup and remained active. =1980s= On the morning of November 19, 1981, Police Inspector Pritam Singh Bajwa and Constable Surat Singh of Jalandhar were gunned down in Daheru village nearby Khanna in Ludhiana district. The militants, who were hiding in the house of Amarjit Singh Nihang, all managed to escape. This act gained Babbar Khalsa and its chief Talwinder Singh Parmar notoriety. Named in the first information report were Wadhawa Singh (current Babbar Khalsa chief, now residing in Pakistan), Talwinder Singh Parmar, Amarjit Singh Nihang, Amarjit Singh (Head Constable), Sewa Singh (Head Constable) and Gurnam Singh (Head Constable). On June 23, 1985: BKI militants bombed Air India Flight 182 going from Montreal, Canada to New Delhi, India. An improvised explosive device placed inside the cargo hold of the Boeing 747 destroyed the plane with an explosion at an altitude of 31,000 feet in Irish airspace and it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 329 passengers were killed, including 268 Canadian, 27 British and 24 Indian citizens. Parmar and Inderjit Singh Reyat were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on explosive charges, linking the two to the Air India Flight 182 bombing and 1985 Narita International Airport bombing. Parmar was acquitted of all charges. Inderjit Singh Reyat admitted to building the bomb, was convicted in the Air India bombing. Reyat a member of the ISYF, was found guilty of manslaughter for making the bombs and had to spend more than 20 years in prison at Canada, and is the only individual convicted in these attacks as of 9 Feb 2009. The Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182 concluded that, regarding Talwinder Singh Parmar, \\"[it] is now believed that he was the leader of the conspiracy to bomb Air India flights\\"DOSSIER 2 TERRORISM, INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ‚Äì CANADA‚ÄôS RESPONSE TO SIKH TERRORISM February 19, 2007 Five Babbar Khalsa members from Montreal were arrested May 30, 1986, for another plot to bomb Air India flights out of New York City. Newspaper editor Tara Singh Hayer was targeted with a bomb at his office in January 1986. Just weeks later, Sikhs from the Hamilton temple along with Air India bombing suspects Talwinder Singh Parmar and Ajaib Singh Bagri were arrested after being wiretapped discussing blowing up the Parliament and kidnapping children of MPs in India. Visiting Punjabi Cabinet Minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu was ambushed in Canada, surviving being shot in March 1986 by four gunmen.\\"Using the Events of Air India to Explain Canada‚Äôs Anti-terrorism Legislation\\" Michael Zekulin Department of Political Science University of Calgary Paper, presented at 2010 Annual Meeting of the Prairie Political Science Association University of Manitoba, October 1‚Äì2, 2010 =1990s= On 8 January 1990, Khalistan Liberation Force in co-operation with Babbar Khalsa, killed DSP Gobind Ram in a bomb blast. On 7 September 1991, eight Babbar Khalsa militants had an encounter with CRPF personnel near the village of Maujiya. On the militants' side, three were killed: Khem Singh Babbar, Paramjeet Singh Babbar and Gurmail Singh Babbar. The encounter lasted for 24 hours. On 31 August 1995, Dilawar Singh Babbar assassinated Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh in a suicide bomb attack at the civil secretariat in Chandigarh.The Telegraph, Calcutta, India, \\"Beant trial trio in tunnel getaway\\" 22 January 2004 Dilawar claimed allegiance to the Babbar Khalsa and four other members of the Babbar Khalsa were named responsible for the killing of Beant Singh. =2000s= In 2007, Babbar Khalsa militants were arrested by the Punjab police for a bombing at the Shingar Cinema Complex in Ludhiana on 14 October 2007, in which 6 people were killed and 37 wounded. The police also recovered 2 pistols, 5.10 kg of RDX and 3 detonators from them. The militants had gone to Pakistan with a Sikh Jatha for pilgrimage, where they received the training for making bombs. The group received explosive devices from Pakistan across the international border in Bikaner, Rajasthan. =2010s= Four Babbar Khalsa International UK members were arrested and later bailed in July 2010 in connection with the murder of a Sikh leader in Punjab, India. In March 2017, Balwinder Singh, the head of Babbar Khalsa's operations in the United States, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by Nevada U.S. district judge for conspiracy to launch a terrorist attack in India in 2013. Singh plead guilty to providing funding and materials to a co-conspirator, who was to travel to India to assassinate or maim an Indian government official. The target government official was to be determined upon the co-conspirator's arrival. Decline The crackdown on Sikh militant organisations by the Indian Government in the early 1990s, followed by government infiltration of the Khalistan movement and the various militant organisations respectively, greatly weakened the Babbar Khalsa, ultimately leading to the death of Sukhdev Singh Babbar (9 August 1992) and Talwinder Singh Parmar (15 October 1992). Parmar had been killed by Indian police in a gunfight per the official sources. Despite setbacks incurred in the early nineties, Babbar Khalsa is still active underground, although not to the extent it once was. Current leadership resides with Wadhawa Singh Babbar.

They were an improved version of the used in the attack on the German battleship . They carried a crew of four, typically a lieutenant in command, with a sub-lieutenant as deputy, an engine room artificer in charge of the mechanical side and a seaman or leading-seaman. At least one of them was qualified as a diver. In addition to the two side charges (each of which contained two tons of amatol explosive), they carried around six limpet mines which were attached to the target by the diver. They and their depot ship arrived at Labuan in July 1945. Four of them managed to take part in operations before the war ended. Sabre and Foil These operations, carried out in July 1945, were intended to cut the undersea telephone cables connecting Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong and Tokyo. The intention was to oblige the Japanese to use radio and render themselves open to message interception. Operation Sabre was directed at the Hong Kong to Saigon telephone cable, and carried out by XE4, which was towed to within of the Mekong Delta by the submarine HMS Spearhead, where she looked for the two telephone cables by using a towed grapnel. She eventually snagged the first cable, and managed to haul it about off the seabed. XE4's diver, Sub-Lieutenant K.M. Briggs, used the net/cable cutter to sever it. The second cable was soon found as well, and was severed by the second diver, Sub- Lieutenant A. Bergius. Two divers were carried due to the operating rule that a diver should not spend more than 20 minutes in depths over and no more than 10 minutes over . XE4 and Spearhead returned to Labuan on 3 August 1945. Operation Foil was directed at the Hong Kong to Singapore telephone cable and carried out by XE5 against the Hong Kong end of the cable, after being towed into position by the submarine HMS Selene. Operating close inshore near to Lamma Island, working conditions were poor, XE5's divers having to work in thick mud under the constant threat of oxygen poisoning. Despite repeated attempts it was not completely certain that the cable had in fact been severed, and it was not until after the Japanese surrender that it was confirmed that XE5 had succeeded in doing so. XE5 and Selene returned to Subic Bay on 6 August 1945. Operation Struggle In August 1945, HMS XE1 and XE3 executed a joint attack on Japanese warships within Singapore harbour. XE3 was tasked with mining the heavy cruiser Takao while XE1 was to attack the heavy cruiser My≈çk≈ç. The approach of XE3 along the Straits of Johor and through the various harbour defences took 11 hours plus a further two hours to locate the camouflaged target. Despite several opportunities for Japanese defenders to spot the vessel, XE3 successfully reached the Takao, fixed limpet mines and dropped its two, 2-ton side charges. The withdrawal was successfully made and XE3 returned to HMS Stygian, her towing submarine. Meanwhile, XE1 was delayed by Japanese patrol craft, and her captain, realizing that he could not reach My≈çk≈ç (which was two miles further into the harbour than Takao) before the mines already laid by XE3 would explode, also elected to drop his own charges under Takao. XE1 also successfully returned to her towing submarine, HMS Spark. The Takao, already damaged and not seaworthy, was severely damaged and never sailed again. XE3s commander, Lieutenant Ian Edward Fraser RNR, and diver Leading Seaman James Joseph Magennis were awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for their part in the attack; whilst Sub-Lieutenant William James Lanyon Smith, RNZNVR, who was at the controls of XE3, received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO); Engine Room Artificer Third Class Charles Alfred Reed, who was at the wheel, received the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM). XE1's C/O, Lieutenant John Elliott Smart RNVR received the DSO, and Sub-Lieutenant Harold Edwin Harper, RNVR received the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC); and ERA Fourth Class Henry James Fishleigh and Leading Seaman Walter Henry Arthur Pomeroy received the Distinguished Service Medal. ERA Fourth Class Albert Nairn, Acting Leading Stoker Jack Gordan Robinson, and Able Seaman Ernest Raymond Dee were Mentioned in Despatches for their part in bringing the two midget submarines from harbour to the point where the crews that took part in the attack took over.

The man is wearing traditional Bavarian lederhosen. Lederhosen (; , ; singular in German usage: Lederhose) are short or knee-length leather breeches that are worn as traditional garments in some regions of German-speaking countries. The longer ones are generally called Bundhosen or Kniebundhosen. Once common workwear across Central Europe, these clothes‚Äîor Tracht‚Äîare particularly associated with Bavaria and the Tyrol region. Traditional Bavarian men's clothing Bavarian men wearing short lederhosen. Formerly, lederhosen were worn for hard physical work; they were more durable than a fabric garment. Today, they are mostly worn as leisurewear. Today, lederhosen and dirndl attire is common at Oktoberfest events around the world. Lederhosen were once widespread among men of the Alpine and surrounding regions, including Bavaria, Austria, the Allg√§u, Switzerland, the autonomous Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol (formerly part of Austria-Hungary) and Alpine area of today's Slovenia. But they were not usually worn in southwestern Germany or Switzerland. La Couturi√®re Parisienne, however, claims that lederhosen were originally not exclusively a Bavarian garment but were worn all over Europe, especially by riders, hunters, and other people involved in outdoor activities. The flap (drop front) may have been a unique Bavarian invention. The drop-front style became so popular in the 18th century that it was known in France as √† la bavaroise, \\"in the Bavarian style.\\" One attempt at modernizing lederhosen ‚Äî ‚Äúdouble zipper‚Äù lederhosen were once sold as workout wear in Europe during the 1970s. The popularity of lederhosen in Bavaria dropped sharply in the 19th century. They began to be considered as uncultured peasants' clothing that was not fitting for modern city-dwellers. However, in the 1880s a resurgence set in, and several clubs were founded in Munich and other large cities devoted to preserving traditional rural clothing styles. The conception of lederhosen as a quintessentially Bavarian garment that is worn at festive occasions rather than at work dates largely from this time. Lederhosen have remained regionally popular and are popularly associated with virility and brawn. Some men wear them when gardening, hiking, working outdoors, or attending folk festivals or beer gardens. They are a symbol of regional pride in Bavaria and the other areas where they are worn, but are rarely seen elsewhere. Traditional lederhosen are hand made of tanned deer leather which makes the pants soft and light but very tearproof. As those leather pants are very valuable and can last a lifetime, some Bavarians even bequeath their lederhosen to the next generation. Some variations of modern lederhosen are made of heavier, lower quality leather, or imitations like velour leather which make them much cheaper but less durable. All variations are usually equipped with two side pockets, one hip pocket, one knife pocket, and a codpiece (drop front). For an Oktoberfest costume, people combine lederhosen with Haverlschuhe, stockings and a classic white or checked shirt.  Traditional German boys' clothing  Boys‚Äô lederhosen, usually shorter than men‚Äôs and lacking embroidery. Note the drop-front flap that is typical of lederhosen. German boys used to wear lederhosen up to the age of about sixteen years. These lederhosen were not decorated with embroidery but had the typical attributes of suspenders/braces and drop-front flap. Even today, some German and French Scouts wear various forms of lederhosen, although in most cases they are not part of their official uniform. Lederhosen were also worn by Austrian boys from the 1930s to the 1970s. Today they are worn on special occasions, such as a Biergarten or Zeltfest. Girls wear the Dirndl, which is part of Austrian Tracht.

At the bank holiday at the beginning of August they organise a heritage weekend with a variety of events and an annual publication, The Corran Herald. The Irish Raptor Research Centre near Templehouse Lough was originally set up for research purposes but since 2003 demonstrates the fun and educational Eagles Flying Show as well. A children's playground has been created at Town Park. A miniature railway has been in operation there on some summer weekends. Landmarks =Buildings= It is a historic town, with Ballymote Castle, the last and the mightiest of the Norman castles in Connacht. This castle, dating from 1300, was built by Richard de Burgh. It also has a Market House, a three-bay, two-story building formerly used by the South Sligo Adult Community Mental Health team of the Health Service Executive. There has been a library in the town since 1949. Originally run from the Loftus Hall it was relocated to the former courthouse in 1984 before moving in 2011 to its current location on Teeling Street. =September 11 memorial= Ireland's National Monument to Fighting 69th in Ballymote The then Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, unveiled Ireland's national monument to the 69th Infantry Regiment (aka The Fighting 69th) and Michael Corcoran in Ballymote on 22 August 2006. At the foot of the monument is a piece of steel from the World Trade Center in New York, which was attacked on September 11, 2001. The steel was donated by the family of a local man who died in the attack. Transport Ballymote lies on regional roads R293, R295 and R296, and on the main Dublin to Sligo railway line.

Founded in 1980 with a completely female line-up, they became chart hit makers both within, and outside, their native country. The lead singer of the band was vocalist Anja Huwe. Xmal Deutschland's last album was released in 1989. Biography Xmal Deutschland was formed in 1980 by Anja Huwe (vocals), Manuela Rickers (guitar), Fiona Sangster (keyboards), Rita Simonsen (bass guitar) and Caro May (drums) in Hamburg, Germany. Their first single, \\"Schwarze Welt\\", was released a year later on Alfred Hilsberg‚Äôs ZickZack label. The band also contributed to the label compilation Lieber Zuviel Als Zuwenig (ZZ 45). Around this time Rita Simonsen was replaced by Wolfgang Ellerbrock. In 1982, the band released the goth classic \\"Incubus Succubus\\". Drummer Caro May left the band and formed a new band, and the vacant drummer position was filled by Manuela Zwingmann the same year. While German audiences were less than receptive at first, a United Kingdom tour opening for the Cocteau Twins resulted in a deal with independent label 4AD. Their debut album, Fetisch and the singles \\"Qual\\" and \\"Incubus Succubus II\\" were released in 1983, all three making the UK Indie Charts, even though the band wrote and performed in German. Manuela Zwingmann left the band after one year, being replaced by Peter Bellendir. This lineup, Huwe/Rickers/Sangster/Ellerbrock/Bellendir was the longest lasting. The single \\"Reigen\\" and the album Tocsin were released in 1984, followed by a world tour in 1985. Tocsin reached number 86 in the UK Albums Chart. The Sequenz EP was essentially a remake of a John Peel session, which had been originally recorded on 30 April 1985, and broadcast on 13 May 1985. The EP contained the tracks \\"Jahr Um Jahr II\\", \\"Autumn\\" (the band‚Äôs first song with English lyrics, apart from brief snatches of English that appeared in \\"Qual\\", \\"Young Man\\" and \\"Tag f√ºr Tag\\") and \\"Polarlicht\\" but omitted \\"Der Wind\\", which was played at the Peel sessions. \\"Matador\\", produced by Hugh Cornwell of The Stranglers, was released in 1986. Xmal Deutschland also opened for The Stranglers at a concert in Wembley Arena, London, as well as supporting the Stranglers on their entire UK tour. Their follow-up album, Viva was recorded in Hamburg and was released in 1987 through Phonogram, followed by the single \\"Sickle Moon\\". Viva contains a large number of English lyrics, including a poem by Emily Dickinson. It was during this time that the band were interviewed by Jamie Meakes for the fanzine House of Dolls. After the release of Viva, Manuela Rickers, Fiona Sangster and Peter Bellendir left the group. Anja Huwe and Wolfgang Ellerbrock continued to work with Frank Z (of Abw√§rts) on guitar. Producer Henry Staroste played keyboards and studio drummer Curt Cress completed the line-up that recorded the 1989 LP Devils, and the singles \\"Dreamhouse\\" and \\"I'll Be Near You\\". This also proved to be the last release of Xmal Deutschland, showing a change of direction towards mainstream pop. The group made a few live appearances in 1990 before eventually disbanding later that same year.

Bristol Bay is 400 km (250 mi) long and 290 km, (180 mi) wide at its mouth. A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the Cinder, Egegik, Igushik, Kvichak, Meshik, Nushagak, Naknek, Togiak, and Ugashik. Upper reaches of Bristol Bay experience some of the highest tides in the world. One such reach, the Nushagak Bay near Dillingham and another near Naknek in Kvichak Bay have tidal extremes in excess of 10 m (30 ft), ranking them -- and the area -- as eighth highest in the world. Coupled with the extreme number of shoals, sandbars, and shallows, makes navigation troublesome, especially during the area's frequently strong winds. As the shallowest part of the Bering Sea, Bristol Bay is one of the most dangerous regions for large vessels.  History  Tundra landscape near Bristol Bay In ancient times, much of Bristol Bay was dry and arable, along with much of the Bering Sea Land Bridge. More recently, its proximity to mineral, animal and seafood riches provided an incentive for human habitation along its shoreline. Early Russian and English exploration provided most of the non-native influences of the area. During his voyage through the area in 1778, the famed British navigator and explorer, Captain James Cook named the area \\"in honor of the Admiral Earl of Bristol\\" in England. = Early settlement = Shore of Bristol Bay After establishing some temporary settlements in the late 1790s, The Russian American Company sent exploratory parties to document the coast and nearby inland areas of Bristol Bay. One of these charted the area between the Kuskokwim and Nushagak Rivers. The original Eskimo village at Naknek went through various names as recorded by the Russians after they arrived in the area in 1819 (1821-‚ÄúNaugeik‚Äù; 1880- ‚ÄúKinuyak‚Äù; and finally Naknek as named by Russian Navy Captain Tebenkov). Later, in 1819, an Aleut by the name of Andrei Ustiugov drew the first intensive charts of Bristol Bay. Additionally, ships of the Russian Navy conducted extensive surveys of the Bering Sea coastline into the mid-19th century, naming many of the geographical features commonly used today: Capes Constantine, Chichagof, Menshikof and Greig, Mounts Veniaminof and Pavlof, Becharof Lake, etc. In 1883 the first salmon cannery was open in Bristol Bay‚Äù https://www.nps.gov/lacl/learn/historyculture/upload/Canneries-Cabins- Caches-508-compliant-Sept-2015-low-res.pdf (Source information from the cannery article to give context on the expansion of the salmon industry in Alaska and the history of growth. The influence of the Katmai Volcano Explosion in 1912 and the influenza epidemic in 1919 decimated the Naknek people and area. According to oral history, there were only about three original families left at that time.(https://www.nps.gov/lacl/learn/historyculture/upload/Canneries-Cabins- Caches-508-compliant-Sept-2015-low-res.pdf) = World War Two = On July 7, Alaskans witnessed conflict as Japanese fishing vessels entered the waters of Bristol Bay with 10,000-ton fishing trawlers to harvest salmon. At that time, the Fisheries Bureau prohibited the use of motorized vessels, fish traps, and purse seines in Alaska. This was to ensure a 50% escapement of the spawning salmon, to guarantee their sustainability. The Japanese fleet was composed of diesel-powered steel vessels. The Japanese had a technological advantage over the American fisherman and dominated the bay that summer. In 1938, the United States agreed with Japan that the Japanese would refrain from fishing in Alaskan waters. This agreement was honored until Japan and the United States entered World War 2. In the 1950s, Japan was strengthening its fishing presence in the Pacific; the US, Canada, and Japan passed the North Pacific Fisheries Treaty. This treaty managed the resources of the region jointly to preserve the future generations of fish. This agreement is the model for international fisheries regulations today.http://www.visitbristolbay.com/visitor-guide/cultures.html  Industry  Nushagak River, draining into Bristol Bay Bristol Bay is home to the world's most abundant sockeye salmon fishery as well as strong runs of chum salmon, silver salmon, and king salmon, each occurring seasonally.La Ganga, Maria L. (December 16, 2014) \\"Obama protects Alaska's Bristol Bay from oil and gas drilling\\" Los Angeles Times Kings are usually the first to run up the river followed by reds and chums. Silvers and Pinks are the last to run up the river. On an international scale, sockeye salmon are a relatively rare creature. Like other wild salmon species, sockeye harvests fluctuate but comprise 4 to 7 percent of global salmon production and 13 to 20 percent of native salmon harvests. Between 2011 and 2014, sockeye accounted for 5 percent of the world's salmon harvest by volume and 15 percent of the world's wild salmon harvest. =Commercial fishing= Bristol Bay is home to the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs. During the first 50 years of commercial salmon fishing in Bristol Bay, the fishing boats were restricted to sail power. When this restriction lifted in 1951, it took only seven short years to outfit all the boats (approximately 1,500) with diesel or gas engines. In the late 1920s another law was passed restricting the length of the boats to 32 feet. This law holds true even today.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main = Canneries = Bristol Bay is a remote part of Alaska. The canneries preserve the freshness of the salmon which are gutted, cleaned, and processed on site. These companies have established a presence in Bristol Bay. Canneries include North Pacific Seafoods, Togiak Seafoods, Bristol Bay Setnet, Friedman Family Fisheries, Peter Pan Seafoods, Ekuk Fisheries, Big Creek Shore plant, Coffee Point Seafood, Icicle Seafoods, Wild Premium Salmon, Seafood Enterprises of Alaska, Alaska General Seafoods, Alaska Salmon Wild, Da Kine Enterprise, Extreme Salmon, Great Ruby Fish, My Girl, Naknek Family Fisheries, North Pacific Seafoods, Ocean Beauty, Silver Bay Seafoods, Trident Seafoods, Tulchina Fisheries, Diamond Lodge Smokehouse, and Nakeen Homepack. Shore of Bristol Bay near Naknek Major industries are commercial fishing and the associated canneries, sport fishing, hunting and tourism. The number of business lodges, hunting- and fishing-resorts and visitors to the nearby Katmai National Park and Preserve has grown exponentially in recent years. Sports fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen targeting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).[18] The area has also experienced significant interest in oil and mineral development, most notably with the proposed Pebble Mine on the north shore of Iliamna Lake, and auctioning of leases to tracts in the southern Bristol Bay area known as the North Aleutians Basin, an area which has been closed to offshore oil and gas development since a moratorium in 1998. The draft plan by the Bureau of Land Management (pending public comments until 2/5/2007), also proposes to open most of the BLM's in the area to hard rock mining and oil and gas drilling.  Demographics  Abandoned cabin on Bristol Bay The three largest communities of the Bristol Bay area are Dillingham, King Salmon, and Naknek. Smaller communities which dot the coastline and rivers of Bristol Bay include: Egegik , Ekuk , Igiugig , Manokotak , New Stuyahok , Newhalen, Nondalton, Pilot Point, Port Heiden, Ugashik (, and South Naknek. All of these communities are primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives, except for Dillingham and King Salmon; the former being influenced early-on by white salmon-cannery employees of European descent and the latter being heavily populated by military personnel stationed, primarily during Cold War years, at the nearby King Salmon Air Force Station and later by visitors and employees of the nearby Katmai National Park and Preserve.  Proposed Pebble Mine  A mineral exploration project investigating a large porphyry copper, gold, and molybdenum deposit in the Bristol Bay region has been proposed and may be undertaken by British- Australianhttp://www.riotinto.com/documents/140415_Rio_Tinto_delivers_strong_first_quarter_production.pdf Rio Tinto Group and Japanese https://www.nrdc.org/stories/crushing-alaskas- pebble-mine conglomerate Mitsubishi. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC staked a claim on the site in 2001 and with its partners, invested 500 million dollars into the project. The mining company lost all of its partners in 2011 due to increasing government regulations and distrust by its partners. Because of the estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste that must be permanently stored in the area, which is an active earthquake zone, and Rio Tinto's environmental track record, which is seen as poor by many environmental advocacy groups, fears have been raised about the potential impact on the Bristol Bay area and its wildlife and residents. In April 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an assessment of the impact of the proposed mining operations on fisheries, wildlife, and native Alaska tribes.United States Environmental Protection Agency Proposal to Protect the Bristol Bay Watershed Between 2014 and May 2017, Pebble sued the EPA several times. The company argued the EPA unfairly assumed the scope of the mine before it formally filed mining plans. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC. accused the government agency of colluding with anti-mine activists to reach its conclusions. In July 2019, the EPA withdrew their preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-withdraws- outdated-preemptive-proposed-determination-restrict-use-pebble-deposit In September 2020, while posing as potential investors in the mine an environmental activist group secretly taped conversations with Roland Thiessen, chief executive of Northern Dynasty Minerals, and Tom Collier, chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership. During the conversations Collier and Thiessen detailed their plans to gain the favor of elected politicians from Juneau to Washington, D.C. to gain a favorable outcome for the approval of the mining operation. The conversations also revealed that while the company is seeking a 20 year permit, Thiessen outlined how it could last another 160 years.

It usually results in remission of myasthenia gravis with the help of medication including steroids. However, this remission may not be permanent. Thymectomy is indicated when thymoma are present in the thymus. Anecdotal evidence suggests MG patients with no evidence of thymoma may still benefit from thymectomy, thus the procedure is (unless and until a much-discussed clinical survey ever reaches a contraindicatory conclusion) commonly prescribed. Surgical approaches There are a number of surgical approaches to the removal of the thymus gland: transternal (through the breast bone), transcervical (through a small neck incision), transthoracic (through one or both sides of the chest.) * The transternal approach is most common and uses the same length-wise incision through the sternum (breast bone) used for most open-heart surgery. It is espoused by surgeons such as Alfred Jaretzki and is the most commonly performed procedure due to its relative simplicity. * The transcervical approach is a less invasive procedure that allows for removal of the entire thymus gland through a small neck incision There has been no difference in success in symptom improvement between the transsternal approach and the minimally invasive transcervical approach. Video-assisted approaches, such as laparoscopic surgery, are increasingly prescribed since the less invasive nature of the procedure strikes a balance with the lack of actual clinical evidence supporting thymectomy in non-thymomal cases. Impact of thymic loss Thymectomy is a treatment for myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disease. For about 60% of people with myasthenia gravis, thymectomy significantly improves their symptoms of muscle weakness. In about 30% of cases, thymectomy results in permanent remission of myasthenia gravis, negating the need for any additional medication. Improvements in condition as a result of thymectomy are often delayed, typically occurring one or two years after the surgical procedure, though could be as late as five years. In some people, thymectomy does not alleviate any symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Experiments involving thymectomy in newborn mice showed that it unexpectedly resulted in wasting disease when performed before the mouse was three days old. This is because the thymus is the site where T cells are generated. Removal of the thymus resulted in autoimmunity, in which the immune cells attack the organism's own healthy cells and tissues.

She is the daughter of H√¶reth2. After Beowulf defeats Grendel and Grendel's mother, he and his men returned to their native country, where they are received by Hygelac and Hygd. Hygd is beautiful, wise, courteous, and attentive. She pours mead in the drinking horns of the warriors thus fulfilling (in the same vein as Wealh√æeow, the queen of Denmark) the important role of hostess and cup-bearer in the poem. The poet juxtaposes this virtue with the vice of Queen Mod√æry√∞ (who appears in line 1932). Beowulf gives her three horses and a magnificent torc (the Brosing, i.e. Brisingamen, the necklace of the goddess Freyja) that he received from Wealh√æeow. Hygd shows her wisdom and love for the Geatish people when her husband falls in the raid in Frisia against the Franks. Instead of securing the throne for her own offspring, she offers it to Beowulf as she considers her son Heardred to be too inexperienced to defend Geatland against the Swedes. Beowulf, however, talks in favour of young Heardred and convinces her to proclaim him King of the Geats instead.

After Sir Robert Sandeman's mission to Kalat in 1876, the Quetta Fort was occupied by his escort and the country was managed on behalf of the Khan of Kalat up to 1883, when it was leased to the British Government for an annual rent of Rs. 25,000 through a treaty between Khan and the British Empire. It was formed, with Pishin and Shorarud, into a single administrative charge in 1883. Up to 1888 Old Chaman was the most advanced post on the frontier; but, on the extension of the railroad across the Khwaja Amran, the terminus was fixed at its present site, from that place. The boundary with Afghanistan was finally demarcated in 1895‚Äì6. The city area of Shalkot was inhabited by the Kasi tribe and the surroundings were occupied by Bazai Tribe with few other nomads including the tribes of Sulaimankhail, Kharoti, Nasar, and Baitanai. Being on the outskirts of Kandahar, it was not much developed. With the arrival of British troops, doors of development were opened. Very soon people saw roads, trains and schools in the area. Administrative divisions =Subdivisions= In 1975, Quetta and Pishin were made separate districts. Quetta District today consists of two towns,Towns & Unions in the City District of Quetta and one sub-tehsil. District Quetta was declared as City District in 2001 having three tehsils and 67 Union councils. * Zarghoon * Chiltan * Panjpai Sub-Tehsil =Provincial assembly= The district is represented in the provincial assembly by six constituencies.Provincial Assembly ‚Äì Balochistan Demographics In 1998, % of the population resided in urban areas.

They were used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The basic concept is still in use. The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later (with a larger version) Britain, deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbours. The human torpedo concept has occasionally been used by recreational divers. Manned torpedo, called Maiale, at the Museo nazionale della scienza e della tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci of Milan. History of common wartime models The concept of a tiny manned submarine carrying a bomb was developed and patented by a British naval officer in 1909, but was never used during the First World War. The Italian Navy experimented with a primitive tiny sub carrying two men and a limpet mine as early as 1918 and this craft did have some success. The first truly practical human torpedo was the Italian Maiale (nicknamed the \\"pig\\" because it was difficult to steer) used in the Second World War. The Maiale was electrically propelled by a motor in most of the units manufactured, with a top speed of and often required a travel time of up to two hours to its target. Two crewmen in diving suits rode astride, each equipped with an oxygen rebreather apparatus. They steered the craft to the enemy ship. The \\"pig\\" could be submerged to , and hypothetically to , when necessary. On arrival at the target, the detachable warhead was released for use as a limpet mine. If they were not detected, the operators then rode the mini sub away to safety. Development began in 1935 but the first 11 were not completed until 1939 by San Bartolomeo Torpedo Workshops in La Spezia, Italy and a larger number followed. The official Italian name for the majority of the craft that were manufactured was Siluro a Lenta Corsa (SLC or \\"Slow- running torpedo\\"). Two distinct models were made, Series 100 and then (in 1942) Series 200 with some improvements. At least 50 SLCs were built by September 1943. In operation, the Maiale torpedo was carried by another vessel (usually a conventional submarine), and launched near the target. Most manned torpedo operations were at night and during the new moon to cut down the risk of being seen. Attacks in 1940 were unsuccessful but in 1941, the Italian navy (Regia Marina) successfully forced the harbour of Alexandria and damaged the two British battleships and , as well as the tanker Sagona. This feat encouraged the British to develop their own torpedo \\"chariots\\". The last Italian model, the SSB (for Siluro San Bartolomeo, \\"San Bartolomeo Torpedo\\") was built with a partly enclosed cockpit, a more powerful motor and larger warhead (up from the earlier SLC's warheads). Three units were made but not operationally used because Italy surrendered in 1943. The first British version of the concept was named the Chariot manned torpedo. Two models were made; Mark I was long while Mark II was long, both suitable for carrying two men. Later versions were larger, starting with the original X-class submarine, a midget submarine, long, no longer truly a human torpedo but similar in concept. The X-Craft were capable of on the surface or submerged. They were designed to be towed to their intended area of operations by a full-size 'mother' submarine. The German navy also developed a manned torpedo by 1943, the Neger, intended for one man, with a top speed of and carrying one torpedo; the frequent technical problems often resulted in the deaths of operators. Roughly 40 of these were made and they did manage to sink a few ships. The later Marder (pine marten in English) was about long and more sophisticated and could dive to depths of but with very limited endurance. About 500 were built. Construction CGI image of human torpedo: British Mk 1 \\"chariot\\" ridden by two frogmen with UBA rebreathers A typical manned torpedo has a propeller, hydroplanes, a vertical rudder and a control panel with controls for its front rider. It usually allows for two riders who sit facing forwards. It has navigation aids such as a compass, and nowadays modern aids such as sonar and GPS positioning and modulated ultrasound communications gear. It may have an air (or other breathing gas) supply so its riders do not have to drain their own apparatus while they are riding it. In some the riders' seats are enclosed; in others the seats are open at the sides as in sitting astride a horse. The seat design includes room for the riders' swimfins (if used). There are flotation tanks (typically four: left fore, right fore, left aft, right aft), which can be flooded or blown empty to adjust buoyancy and attitude. Timeline SLC displayed in the \\"Museo della Scienza e della Tecnica\\" in Milan * 1909: The British designer Commander Godfrey Herbert received a patent for a manned torpedo. During World War I, it was rejected by the War Office as impracticable and unsafe. * 1 November 1918: Two men of the Regia Marina, Raffaele Paolucci and Raffaele Rossetti, in diving suits, rode a primitive manned torpedo (nicknamed Mignatta or \\"leech\\") into the Austro-Hungarian Navy base at Pola (Istria), where they sank the Austrian battleship and the freighter Wien using limpet mines. They had no breathing sets and they had to keep their heads above water, and thus they were discovered and taken prisoner.http://www.marina.difesa.it/storia/galleria/viribus.asp Photographs of the \\"mignatta\\", the first human torpedo invented by Raffaele Rossetti, and the \\"Viribus Unitis\\" sinking * 1938: In Italy the \\"1a Flottiglia Mezzi d'Assalto\\" (First Fleet Assault Vehicles) was formed as a result of the research and development efforts of two men ‚Äì Major Teseo Tesei and Major Elios Toschi of the Italian Royal Navy. The pair resurrected the idea of Paolucci and Rossetti. * 1940: Commander Moccagatta of the Italian Royal Navy reorganised the 1st Fleet Assault Vehicles into the Decima Flottiglia MAS (Tenth Light Flotilla of assault vehicles) or \\"X-MAS\\", under the command of Ernesto Forza. It secretly manufactured manned torpedoes and trained war frogmen, called nuotatori (Italian: \\"swimmers\\"). * 26 July 1941: An attack on Valletta Harbour ended in disaster for the X MAS and Major Teseo Tesei lost his life. * 19 December 1941: The Decima Flottiglia MAS attacked the port of Alexandria with three maiali. The battleships and (and an 8,000-ton tanker) were sunk in shallow water putting them out of action for many months. Luigi Durand de la Penne and five other swimmers were taken prisoner. De la Penne was awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor after the war. * October 1942: Two British Chariot manned torpedoes were carried aboard the Shetland bus fishing-boat Arthur to attack the on Operation Title. They were swung overboard once in Norwegian waters but both became detached from their tow- hooks in a gale and the operation was a total failure. * 8 December 1942. An attack by three manned torpedoes from the against British naval targets was thwarted in Gibraltar. Three divers were killed by depth charges when the British harbour defence \\"reacted furiously\\" to the attack. Among the dead were Lt Licio Visintini, commander of the divers unit on board the Olterra, Petty Officer Giovanni Magro and Sergeant Salvatore Leone, from Taormina, Sicily. Leone's body was never found. Sgt Leone was awarded the Medaglia d'oro al Valor Militare and a memorial was erected in the Community Gardens in Taormina on the 50th anniversary of the attack. The memorial includes a rebuilt maiale and a description of the events, in three languages. * 1‚Äì2 January 1943: British submarines , and took part in Operation Principal. P311 was lost en route to La Maddelena but the other two boats had some success at Palermo, launching two and three Chariots respectively. The Ulpio Traiano was sunk and the stern torn off Viminale. However the cost was high with one submarine and one chariot lost and all but two charioteers captured. * 18 January 1943: Thunderbolt took two chariots to Tripoli for Operation Welcome. This was to prevent blockships being sunk at the harbour mouth, so denying access to the Allies. Again, partial success was achieved. This was the last operation in which chariots were carried in containers on British submarines, although some others followed with the chariots on deck without containers. * 6 May & 10 June 1943: Italian maiali from the Olterra, now under the command of Lt Ernesto Notari, sank six Allied merchant ships in Gibraltar, for a total of 42,000 tn. * September 1943: Operation Source was an attempt to destroy warships including the Tirpitz using X-class midget subs. Of the five deployed, only two were successful. Tirpitz was badly damaged, crippled, and out of action until May 1944. * 2 October 1943: A bigger Italian frogman- carrier, long and carrying four frogmen, called Siluro San Bartolomeo, or SSB, was going to attack Gibraltar, but Italy surrendered and the attack was called off. * 21 June 1944: A British-Italian joint operation was mounted against shipping in La Spezia harbour.

Movies and fiction * The movie The Valiant, made in 1962, is about the sinking of HMS Valiant in Alexandria harbour. There is even a 1953 Italian movie (I sette dell'Orsa Maggiore) about the attack, done with some real members of Decima Flottiglia MAS as support actors in the cast. * The film Above Us the Waves (released in 1955) concentrates on the midget submarine attack on the . The film has a scene of a fight between British and German frogmen at an anti-submarine net; this never happened in the real attack on Tirpitz. * The film The Silent Enemy (released in 1958) does not represent real events accurately. In particular, in the real world there was no attack on Olterra, and no underwater hand-to-hand battle between Italian and British frogmen. The breathing sets used by the film actors representing the Italian frogmen seem to be British naval type rebreathers and not authentic Italian rebreathers. The three chariots seen in the movie, representing Italian maiali, were crudely made film props. * A film The Eagle Has Landed briefly features a German paratroop Officer, a Colonel played by Michael Caine and his men who have been sent to man chariots on the Channel Islands. * Ian Fleming who wrote the James Bond stories was in Naval Intelligence stationed at Gibraltar in the war, and was likely aware of the Italian operations. The chariot seen in the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a realistic-looking but non-functioning film prop. When seen it is in a kit store.

Due to trademark reasons, he is sometimes called Autobot Blaster. He is an Autobot who specializes in communications. Transformers: Generation 1 Blaster's initial transformation is an AM/FM Stereo Cassette Player, commonly referred to as a boombox or ghettoblaster, hence the name. Blaster was a popular character from the original series while not featuring as prominently in the modern Transformers universe. As a member of the Autobot communications sub-group Blaster frequently worked with its other members ‚Äì Eject, Grand Slam, Raindance, Ramhorn, Rewind and Steeljaw. He is the Autobots' answer to the evil Decepticon Soundwave. Blaster (Tempo in France, Radiorobot in Italy, Broadcast in Japan, √ñsszt≈±z in Hungary), like the Autobot Jazz, has a great love of Earth culture, rock music and other forms of music as long as it is hard. He's normally at the forefront of any given situation. As an AM/FM stereo cassette player, he can perform as a deck, plus receive radio signals on a variety of frequencies. Acting as the Autobot communications center, he can transmit signals within a 4,000 mile radius. Blaster is sometimes depicted as carrying various tape warriors within his deck, including (Steeljaw, Ramhorn, Rewind and Eject). =Reception= According to Dan Fleming in Powerplay: toys as popular culture, Blaster represents a guardian of more primitive heroes, as well as the hidden power of technology.Powerplay: toys as popular culture By Dan Fleming Blaster was voted the 5th top Transformer who was ‚Äúbad ass‚Äù in the comics by Topless Robots.10 Transformers That Were Only Badass in the Comics By Rob Bricken, Apr. 14 2009 By Kevin J. Guhl According to Heather Hendershots book about Saturday Morning cartoons, Blaster has a \\"black coded\\" voice and name. Saturday morning censors: television regulation before the V-chip By Heather Hendershot =Animated series= Blaster's first appearance was in episode 20, \\"Dinobot Island, Part 1\\" with no particular origin, simply appearing among the Autobots. Blaster frequently spoke in rhyme resembling rap music lyrics. He had several important appearances in season 2, most notably in \\"Blaster Blues\\", when Spike and Carly brought Blaster to a concert because he loved music. Blaster decided to share his music by transmitting the show to the other Autobots but drove everyone but Cosmos and Jazz, who liked his taste in music, crazy also because the music was so loud they were unable to respond to a Decepticon attack as they got away with stealing a powerful decoder. Blaster and Cosmos went looking for the Decepticon in space then as luck would have it they found something on the moon which turned out to be a Decepticon hideout. Blaster and Cosmos listen in on their plans to conquer the Earth but they ended up getting captured by Astrotrain when they got discovered by Megatron. After they got captured, Megatron decided to use Blaster as a transcrambler with Cosmos being used as a power booster for their device which could foul up Earth commutation systems. Blaster, who wanted to stop Megatron's plan and to redeem himself from before, tipped the other Autobots the Decepticons location by transmitting his music when Megatron ransomed the humans into giving all their energy reverses. Blaster ejected some feedback to overload the Decpeticons machine with Cosmos offering a power boast to destroy it, after Megatron and Astrotrain left base to confront Omega Supreme, Powerglide, Optimus Prime, Spike and Carly when they arrived to stop them and to rescue them, which stop their plans. In the episode \\"Prime Target\\", the big game hunter Lord Chumley captures a secret Soviet jet, leading to panic and the possibility of war. Chumley then set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Chumley captures the Autobots Tracks, Bumblebee, Jazz, Beachcomber, Grapple, Blaster and Inferno. Windcharger and Huffer are able to avoid being trapped. When Cosmos learns of the location Chumley was keeping the captured Autobots, Optimus Prime accepts Chumley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by the Decepticons Astrotrain and Blitzwing's attempt to ally the Decepticons with Chumley, Optimus defeats the big game hunter and frees the Autobots. Chumley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions. He also had a prominent role in \\"Auto-Bop\\". In the episode, Blaster and Tracks encounter Raoul, someone who Tracks has encountered before. Raoul and the posse, the Bop Crew, were finding something suspicious about a nightclub called the Dancitron. As the two Autobots investigate, they find a scheme plotted by the Decepticons Soundwave and Starscream. Later, while Tracks in his Cybertronian shuttle craft mode chases Starscream in an aerial battle, Blaster faces off with his Decepticon counterpart Soundwave in a sonic duel, resulting in a rivalry between the two. In The Transformers: The Movie, set in the year 2005, Blaster was assigned to Autobot City on Earth. During the invasion by Megatron's forces, Blaster was responsible for sending a distress signal to Optimus Prime on Moonbase One. Upon Megatron's orders, Soundwave releases Rumble, Frenzy, Ravage, and Ratbat to jam the transmission to prevent him from establishing contact with the Autobot Moonbase. After Blaster's broadcasting message was interrupted and blocked, Soundwave's cassette minions attack the communications tower. For the first time we also see Blaster's own cassettes, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw. The signal is received and Optimus Prime is able to arrive with reinforcements to defeat the Decepticons. After the attack, Blaster picked up transmissions from Moonbases One and Two. He was not seen for the rest of the film. In episode 78, Madman's Paradise, Spike Witwicky and his wife Carly host a banquet for a visiting ambassador. Their son Daniel gets bored and wandered off. Grimlock follows him, and they fall into a lost chamber where Quintessons banished their criminals to other dimensions. They slipped through to the sorcerous other-dimensional realm of Menonia, and are tricked into fighting on the Red Wizard's side, only to find out that he is the Quintesson criminal, who overthrew the Golden One. Blaster, Ultra Magnus, Eject, Rewind, Ramhorn, and Steeljaw follow, and using Blaster's amplification, they help the Golden One defeat the Red Wizard. With the help of Perceptor, the Autobots and Daniel are returned to Cybertron. He continued to appear throughout the season 3. His last appearance in the U.S. cartoon was in episode 95, \\"The Return of Optimus Prime, Part 2\\". Blaster is destroyed in the Japanese The Transformers: Headmasters series during a fight with Soundwave (who also perished in the fight) and rebuilt two episodes later as Twincast, with a blue/white color scheme as opposed to the red/yellow previously. After a pivotal role in Operation Cassette, he featured as a regular character throughout the whole series. The Twincast toy was recently re-issued by eHobby. Aside from the blue/yellow color scheme, the Twincast toy also differs from the Blaster/Broadcast toy in that the tape compartment can hold two cassette Transformers simultaneously. =Comics= Dreamwave Productions Blaster was among the Autobot resistance during the Age of Interment, shown in the third War Within series. In the second Generation 1 miniseries from Dreamwave Productions, Blaster is part of a resistance group led by Hot Rod. He accompanies Optimus Prime during his attack on Iacon. IDW Publishing Blaster was recently the subject of a Spotlight issue in 2008. The comic depicts Blaster as \\"The Voice\\", acting much like a radio DJ and bolstering Autobot morale in the war against the Decepticons. In the comic, Blaster's alternate form is a tank with a pair of large sonic cannons. In ‚ÄúSpotlight: Blaster‚Äù, Blaster was badly damaged and left adrift in space, but was discovered by an alien ship who bought him back to the Autobot Command Hub under the command of Silverbolt. Having little memory of the event himself, Blaster finds that he was betrayed and nearly killed by a fellow Autobot just before his regular broadcast, in order to demoralize the Autobots just before a Decepticon attack. When the assassin tries again, Blaster eventually finds out that his attacker was Beachcomber, who was being controlled by the Decepticon Bombshell at the behest of Soundwave. Blaster manages to talk Beachcomber into resisting the control, which nearly burns out his mind. Blaster swears to get revenge on Soundwave. Marvel Comics In the Marvel Transformers comics Blaster originally appeared in issue #17, attempting to rescue his friend Scrounge, who was to be executed by Straxus. Blaster is captured himself and forced to watch his friend die. He is rescued by Perceptor and his Autobot group. Later, spying on Straxus' use of the Space Bridge, the Autobots decide to attack and blow it up. They discover the Space Bridge is their comrade Spanner. Blaster then battles Straxus one-on-one, seemingly destroying him. With the Space Bridge blowing itself up, Blaster has no choice but to lead his comrades (Beachcomber, Cosmos, Perceptor, Powerglide, Seaspray and Warpath) across the Bridge to Earth.The Official Overstreet Comic Book Companion, 11th Edition, Page 257 by Robert M.

Using the parts from all the captured Autobots she creates a giant Autobot with herself in control, striking a deal with them that if they would co-operate she would let them go. Circuit Breaker then uses them to oppose the two Decepticons, who were attacking the Statue of Liberty. After defeating the Decepticons with Circuit Breaker the Autobots were released and rebuilt into their original forms. After a brief side adventure in the UK comics, in which Blaster's group are attacked (and almost killed) by the insane future Decepticon Galvatron, Blaster and his men join up with the main Autobots on Earth. Soon after they join, Optimus Prime dies. Blaster delivers the eulogy at his funeral. In issue #27, \\"King of the Hill!\\", Perceptor summons his fellow Autobots Blaster, Hot Spot, Jetfire, Omega Supreme, Ratchet and Silverbolt in order to decide who should take leadership of the Autobots. After an attack by the giant Decepticon Trypticon, Grimlock is chosen to lead them. Blaster would soon regret this. After a mission where their cover had been blown by the Mechanic, a human, he and Goldbug, appalled by Grimlock's willingness to sacrifice humans to achieve their goals, desert. They also ran because they fear Grimlock's anger. They had more adventures; facing the Decepticon Triple Changers and a plague of Scraplets, as well as facing off with a Decepticon strike force sent to destroy Galvatron and Ultra Magnus. Blaster (himself getting more callous) is robbed of his ally when Goldbug and the Throttlebots are betrayed by humans and captured by RAAT. He is subsequently attacked by both the Combaticons and the Protectobots, who had been sent by Grimlock to arrest him. The two combiner teams battled, with Bruticus beating Defensor. With aid from some human children Blaster takes out the giant Decepticon. As a reward, he locks Blast Off into his Decepticon shuttle mode and took them into space. There, they are attacked by Grimlock and the Ark. Surrendering to save their lives, Blaster discovers he was not alone in his discontent, especially after Grimlock had tried to have the kids executed. Events came to a head when Fortress Maximus's group of Autobots link up with Grimlock's group, informing him that many of their group's number had been empowered by linking themselves with humans via the Headmaster and Targetmaster processes. Grimlock is not pleased, and it was quickly realized he had to be defeated. A recently rebuilt and imprisoned Goldbug convinces Blaster to fight in Maximus' place. In the midst of their duel, Ratbat's Decepticons attacked, and the two put aside their differences to lead the Autobots to a partial victory. During the conflict, Maximus sent a unit of his troops back to Nebulos so that Prime will be resurrected via the Powermaster process. Prime soon returns and retakes command, sending Blaster to investigate the Decepticon island resort Club Con, seemingly run by Buster Witwicky. Accompanying Buster's girlfriend Jessie, he soon had his cover blown by the Seacons and was forced to flee. Blaster encounters time-traveling Autobots who intended to deal with Galvatron, a plot detailed in the UK comics. This encounter results in Blaster being displaced to an alternate limbo realm. He is soon freed, only to be deactivated by the Underbase powered Starscream. Blaster was seen among the Autobots being repaired on the Ark when Optimus Prime sent Landmine and Cloudburst on their mission to obtain computer chips to repair fellow Autobots in issue #52, \\"Guess Who The Mechannibals Are Having For Dinner?\\".Seibertron.com\\"Transformers\\" #52 (May 1st, 1989) Despite rescuing Sky Lynx, the two Autobots' mission ended in failure, when the pair realized the Mechannibals came by their computer chips by recycling them from other robots they ate. Blaster's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet is doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, \\"Back from the Dead\\". This was not the end for Blaster; he is one of the Autobots revived by Nucleon by Grimlock and the other Dinobots. Returning to Cybertron, he battles against the coming of Unicron. After the betrayal of the Decepticons, the Autobots follow them to the planet Klo, where they were ambushed. Blaster is one of the few survivors. Then he is badly damaged by Quake's tank mode while Prowl berates Grimlock for inept strategy. He still makes the final battle along with Grimlock, Prowl and a few others. He was present when Optimus Prime returned with the Last Autobot and routed the Decepticon forces. The future Blaster from the Movie continuity would also appear in the UK comics, as one of the crew of Autobot city. Arcee's unintentional dereliction of duty allows a Quintesson sneak attack to catch the city unawares, and Blaster appears to get killed trying to radio for help. His body was later strung up by the Quintessons as a taunting gesture to the other Autobots. However, he helps his comrades from \\"beyond the grave\\", allowing his cassettes Steeljaw, Eject and Ramhorn to assist in taking back the city. It later transpires that depictions of Blaster's \\"death\\" had been greatly exaggerated; he shows up, alive and well, in the prologue to the Time Wars saga, set months after the Quintesson attack on Autobot City.

Originating on the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, it was followed by several updated versions for other computers between 1980 and 1986. Temple of Apshai is considered one of the first graphical role-playing games for home computers, predating even the commercial release of Richard Garriott's Akalabeth: World of Doom. It was an enormous success for its era, selling 20,000 copies by the end of 1981, and 30,000 copies by 30 June 1982 and remaining a best-seller for at least four years.Personal Computing, October 1986, p. 88 It was followed by several sequels and two expansions. The latter were bundled with the main game into the remake Temple of Apshai Trilogy in 1985. Games using the Apshai engine were collectively known as the Dunjonquest series. Gameplay The player in Temple of Apshai assumes the role of an adventurer who explores the mysterious ruins of the Temple of Apshai. The player character investigates room after room of the dungeon crawl while seeking treasure and combatting monsters. Along the way, the player discovers powerful weapons and armor with which to overcome the Temple's inhabitants. The game consists of four dungeons with over 200 rooms in total and features 30 monster types. Temple of Apshai consists of two programs; the Innkeeper and the Dunjonmaster. The game starts with the Innkeeper and the choice to either generate a new character or input an existing one. The game uses six base values taken from Dungeons & Dragons Early tape versions of the game had no means to save progress, and thus the player was prompted to note down all statistics when quitting the game, and had to type them in again manually at the start of the next game. Later floppy versions fixed this by allowing to save the status on the disk. Weapons and armor are purchased in a shop, where it is possible to haggle with the shopkeeper for a discount. Character stats determine which items can be worn. Finally, the player chooses between four dungeons of increasing difficulty to enter the Dunjonmaster part. In the Dunjonmaster program, the screen is divided into a birds-eye view representation of the surroundings and a status summary for the character. Traps, treasures and secret doors are hidden inside the dungeons. Temple of Apshai uses a hybrid between a turn-based and a real time combat system. A player's turn can be used to walk up to 9 steps in the direction the character is facing, turning towards either direction, trying to talk the monster out of the fight, or executing a number of different attacks. A bow and arrows can be used to attack enemies from afar. If the player doesn't make any input for a while, the enemies continue to move and attack in set intervals regardless. All actions decrease the player character's fatigue rating, depending on stats and carrying weight. When this value sinks below zero, the character cannot act anymore before resting. The player gains experience points while adventuring, which raise a number of hidden statistics. Temple of Apshai was the first computer role-playing game with room descriptions. Detailed descriptions of all the rooms in the game's manual complement the sparse graphics and provide vital information. Pen-and-paper games like Dungeons & Dragons frequently make use of verbal depictions given by dungeon masters to suggest to players what is of interest in a setting. Similarly, in Temple of Apshai the player matches an on-screen room number to its entry in the manual that accompanies the game. One sample entry reads: \\"The aroma of vanilla makes the senses reel and the floor of the room is covered with the shiny stuff previously observed. Bones lie scattered across the floor and the clicking sound grows fainter from within. Gems stud the south wall.\\" A vanilla scent is used in the game to suggests the presence of Antmen, the dominant monster type in the temple. When beaten by a monster, the player character may be rescued by one of several non-player characters. Depending on the rescuer, a portion of the player's inventory is taken away as payment. The game has no particular goal other than fighting monsters, collecting treasure and gaining experience points. Development and releases Screenshot of the TRS-80 version of the game, showing the abstract graphics of the early versions. The arrow represents the player character, while the cross symbol is an enemy. The small vertical line next to the player represents a treasure chest. On the right side are listed various statistics about the player character's condition, as well as the type of enemy (a skeleton in this case). Feedback for input commands is also given in this part of the screen. Temple of Apshai was originally programmed by Jim Conelley, founder and president of Automated Simulations / Epyx Software, for TRS-80 and Commodore PET, using BASIC. The role-playing system, named Dunjonquest was designed by Jon Freeman, while the level design of the dungeons was provided by Jeff Johnson (Roadwar 2000). According to Connelley, his motivations to create Temple of Apshai were \\"the popularity of noncomputer role-playing games\\" and the opportunity \\"to create a graphics-oriented adventure game\\". Like most early computer RPGs, Temple of Apshai was influenced by Dungeons & Dragons. Both Connelley and Freeman played Dungeons & Dragons in a group where Connelley acted as the Dungeon Master. An advertisement for Temple of Apshai called the game a \\"version of Dungeons and Dragons\\" and described Connelly as an experienced \\"Dungeon Master, running continuous D & D campaigns\\". The game's documentation included instructions for importing pen-and-paper role-playing game player characters. Temple of Apshai was first released in August 1979. The original release contained the program cassette and the manual in a plastic bag, an unusually professional packaging for the time. Early advertisements promoted versions for TRS-80 and Commodore PET, but a version for the Apple II followed in 1980. The TRS-80, Apple II, and PET versions were sold for $24.95 on cassette and $29.95 on disk. A port to Atari 8-bit computers was advertised by retailers from winter 1981, while Epyx announced a version for IBM PC compatibles to be released in March 1982. Aric Wilmunder coded the Atari program, while Connelley himself is credited for the IBM PC version. In 1983, the game was released for the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore 64, sold at $39.95. Connelley identified Steve Bryson as the programmer of the Commodore 64 version. In 1983, Gessler Educational Software distributed a French language version with the title Le Temple D'Apsha√Ø for the purpose of French language education. Both the game and manual were translated entirely, kept in a French Canadian writing style. Legacy A Mosquito appears!. Typical gameplay of Temple of Apshai. In all versions from Apple II onwards, the abstract symbols of the original were replaced with concrete realizations of the characters (Commodore 64 version pictured). Temple of Apshai was the first game in Automated Simulations' Dunjonquest series, which span ten individual titles, including expansions, smaller games, and a full sequel, Hellfire Warrior. Two of the releases, Upper Reaches of Apshai and Curse of Ra, were add-ons to Temple of Apshai which required the original program to run. The level design and room descriptions for both were created by Tim Bird, Mark Madrid and Andrew Martin. Upper Reaches of Apshai contains four new dungeon levels for beginning characters, and conveys a more humorous tone with suburban environments like a vegetable garden and enemies like killer tomatoes. Curse of Ra is set in ancient Egypt and has higher difficulty. It also consists of four dungeon levels, with 179 rooms total. In 1983, Epyx released the action-oriented Gateway to Apshai, a prequel to Temple of Apshai whose story is set at a time before the Temple of Apshai, where the original game took place, was rediscovered. In 1985, Epyx published the remake Temple of Apshai Trilogy. Reception Temple of Apshai was very successful. Automated Simulations reported that it had sold 20,000 copies of the game by 1981.Paul Freiverger, \\"This Company Is Serious About Games\\", InfoWorld, 11 May 1981, p. 10 By 30 June 1982, it was 30,000 copies. After the Commodore 64 Version was released in 1983, it appeared on top of the Compute! Gazette list of best-selling Commodore 64 Entertainment programs, generated from surveys with retailers and distributors. It constantly remained among the five best-selling Commodore 64 games according to that list until the column was discontinued after March 1984. The VIC-20 version also appeared on the list of best-selling games for that system from December 1983 onwards. At the middle of June 1983, the wholesale software distributor Softsel International placed Temple of Apshai seventh in a list of best-selling computer games, compiled from sales to 4,000 retail outlets in 50 states and 30 countries. By that time, the game had been in the distributor's top 50 chart for 38 weeks. Temple of Apshai was Epyx's third best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Early reviews of Temple of Apshai praised the game's graphics and unusual complexity, while criticizing long loading times and slow screen build-up for the dungeon graphics. Compute! stated that Temple of Apshai for the PET \\"is for anyone who is tired of simple 'video games' ... [it] is quite an experience\\". It advised readers to be aware that \\"this is a serious game. Be prepared to THINK\\". Jerry Pournelle in BYTE called it \\"an excellent real-time dungeon game\\", and later reported that his sons had \\"nearly worn out the Dungeons of Apshai\\". Kilobaud Microcomputing criticized the long load times, but liked the game's graphics and \\"excellent\\" documentation. PC Magazine stated that the IBM PC version did not fully exploit the computer's graphics capability, but that players \\"will find excitement and entertainment ... it's certainly worth the silver to grab this game for the PC\\". The magazine was also favorable towards Upper Reaches of Apshai, which it called \\"better than Temple of Apshai in some ways\\". Popular Science called Temple of Apshai \\"a good example of a graphic adventure game\\", but also stated that in it and other games like it \\"the play seems to drag\\" because \\"it takes time to draw the pictures\\". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave Temple of Apshai an overall B rating, concluding that it was \\"an excellent game, one that's very involving\\", and gave the same grade to Hellfire Warrior and Curse of Ra. In 1991 and 1993 Computer Gaming Worlds Scorpia stated that the graphics \\"caused a sensation when it first appeared\\", but also criticized a lack of polish in the programming and slow speed due to the use of BASIC, issues which were improved upon in the Atari 8-bit version. A 2012 overview of TRS-80 games described it as \\"slow, clunky and crash-prone ... this early attempt at an action role-playing game managed little of either\\", and inferior to later Atari and Commodore versions, but \\"quite clearly compelling\\" as an early dungeon crawl. Temple of Apshai was awarded the Origins Award for \\"Best Computer Game of 1980\\", the first to receive this distinction.

Zombie Nation's single \\"Kernkraft 400\\" was a worldwide hit. History The first Zombie Nation EP was released in the spring of 1999 on DJ Hell's label, International DeeJay Gigolo Records. A remix of the song \\"Kernkraft 400\\" on this debut release reached high chart positions all over the world, including number 2 in the United Kingdom. Since 2001, Florian Senfter has released tracks on different labels under Zombie Nation and his other pseudonym John Starlight. In 2002 he did not renew his contract with International DeeJay Gigolo Records and started his own label, Dekathlon Records, where he released his second album \\"Absorber\\" in 2003. In early 2005, the new sublabel UKW Records was launched with John Starlight's John's Addiction Part 1 followed by Paeng Paeng 12\\" by Zombie Nation which was recorded a few months later. Sven V√§th realized the potential of the song at first glance and licensed it for his Cocoon Recordings imprint. The third album Black Toys which was released in 2006 on UKW Records Zombie Nation is a bass dominated soundscape from tech- hop to funk-laden house. In 2007, Zombie Nation collaborated with Tiga under the pseudonym ZZT on the recording \\"Lower State of Consciousness\\". Zombie Nation is also known today as an electronic music live act. Unusually for a DJ, he uses musical hardware on stage to create sounds. The main instrument is an Akai MPC 4000 Music sequencer which he uses in combination with a mixing console and several effects units to do a live arrangement and Mix of his music. In December 2009 and January 2010, Zombie Nation created an orchestrated track, and Florian tells the story like so: The result was a track by \\"Zombie Nation and Friends\\" titled \\"The Mind of Many\\".

Questions from her examinations have appeared in the \\"Education Life\\" section of The New York Times. Steinbock received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. She is a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution.The Hastings Center Hastings Center Fellows. Accessed November 6, 2010 She now lives in Oakland, CA, with her husband, Paul Menzel. In retirement, she has been a Visiting Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In retirement, she continues to publish, her most recent article being \\"Physician-Assisted Death and Severe, Treatment-Resistant Depression,\\" Hastings Center Report 47, no. 5 (2017): 30-42. In November 2018, she delivered \\"The Ethics of Editing Embryos,\\" at the National Conference of Bioethics in Shanghai, China. \\"Life Before Birth\\" Bonnie Steinbock is the author of \\"Life Before Birth,\\" published by Oxford University Press in 1992. As stated in the subtitle, the book discusses the \\"moral and legal status of embryos and fetuses.\\" Chapter One goes into detail about the \\"interest view,\\" the idea that all and only beings who have interests have moral status. The interest view is used to distinguish whose interests we are required to take into consideration. Besides the interest view, Steinbock touched on the legal status of the fetus. From prenatal injury torts, prenatal wrongful deaths, and criminal law, Steinbock gives details about each type of legislation surrounding the fetus. Steinbock further explains consciousness and nonconcious individuals and how that relates to interests. Chapters Two through Six build on the idea that beings with interests have moral status. These chapters discuss abortion, the legal status of the fetus, maternal-fetal conflict, fetal research, and embryo research. Views on animal pain According to Steinbock, the pain of animals is a morally relevant consideration but is not morally decisive. This differs from Peter Singer's view that there is no essential difference between the pain of non-human animals and that of human beings, and also differs from William Baxter's view that animals have no moral consideration on their own whatsoever. Also, she argues that there are morally good reasons for taking our own species as morally special, and thus the interests of non-human animals in relation to pain are not as important as those of human beings‚Äîthough she admits those interests to be existent. Furthermore, Steinbock affirms speciesism. For her, humans are more important than non-human animals, though non-human animals, in their own right, have moral status because they have interests of their own. Beings without interests of their own (e.g., plants, wilderness areas, species, works of art, embryos) do not have moral status, but may have moral value, if there are moral reasons to protect or preserve them. These reasons do not stem from their interests, since they do not have any interests of their own, and so are not \\"golden-rule type\\" reasons, but may be morally very important.

It is often abbreviated M. paratuberculosis or M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis. It is the causative agent of Johne's disease, which affects ruminants such as cattle, and suspected causative agent in human Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The type strain is ATCC 19698 (equivalent to CIP 103963 or DSM 44133). Pathophysiology MAP causes Johne's disease in cattle and other ruminants. It has long been suspected as a causative agent in Crohn's disease in humans,. but studies have been unable to show definite correlation. Recent studies have shown that MAP present in milk can survive pasteurization, which has raised human health concerns due to the widespread nature of MAP in modern dairy herds. MAP survival during pasteurization is dependent on the D72C-value of the strains present and their concentration in milk.Mullan, W.M.A. (2015). HTST pasteurization. Is it time to raise statutory time / temperature conditions to destroy Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP)?. [On- line]. Available from: https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/food- model/277-htst-pasteurization.html . Accessed: 30 July, 2018. Updated October, 2017; April 2018. It is heat resistant and is capable of sequestering itself inside white blood cells, which may contribute to its persistence in milk. It has also been reported to survive chlorination in municipal water supplies. MAP is a slow growing organism and is difficult to culture. Bacterial cultures were regarded as Gold standards for detection of MAP. Detection is very limited in fresh tissues, food, and water. Recently, John Aitken and Otakaro Pathways have discovered a method to culture MAP from human blood. Testing is ongoing. Professor John Hermon-Taylor of Kings College London is developing a new vector type anti MAP vaccine which he claims is both curative and preventative. Stage 1 human trials began in January 2017 and concluded successfully in September 2019. He is also developing a companion MAP blood test. It is not susceptible to antituberculosis drugs (which can generally kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis). MAP is susceptible to antibiotics used to treat Mycobacterium avium disease, such as rifabutin and clarithromycin, however the capacity of these antibiotics to eradicate MAP infection in vivo has not been established. =Crohn's disease= MAP is recognized as a multi- host mycobacterial pathogen with a proven specific ability to initiate and maintain systemic infection and chronic inflammation of the intestine of a range of histopathological types in many animal species, including primates. MAP has been found in larger numbers within the intestines of Crohn's disease patients and in significant amount of irritable bowel syndrome patients compared to those suffering from ulcerative colitis or otherwise healthy controls. One study concluded that MAP \\"may act as a causative agent, have a role in the context of secondary infection, which may exacerbate the disease, or represent non-pathogenic colonisation.\\" Genome The genome of MAP strain K-10 was sequenced in 2005 and found to consist of a single circular chromosome of 4,829,781 base pairs, and to encode 4,350 predicted ORFs, 45 tRNAs, and one rRNA operon.

It begins in the Alaska Range and flows southwest to Nushagak Bay, an inlet of Bristol Bay, east of Dillingham, Alaska. The Mulchatna River is a major tributary. Other navigable tributaries include the Nuyakuk River and the King Salmon River. Jet-boats are commonly used to access these tributaries and the upper Nushagak. The Wood River, Iowithla River and the Kokwok River are smaller tributaries. Fishermen gillnetting on the Nushagak River, 1917 The villages of Portage Creek, Ekwok, Koliganek and New Stuyahok are on the river. The town of Dillingham (Pop. 2,466) is on Nushagak Bay. The Nushagak River is downstream of the proposed Pebble Mine, whose tailings storage lake would sit at the headwaters of the Koktuli River, one of the Nushagak's tributaries. Villages on the Nushagak are among the major opponents of the proposal. Five species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, coho, sockeye, chum, and pink) spawn in the river or its tributaries. Commercial, subsistence and sport fishing are important in the area. Most notable is the annual run of king (Chinook) salmon which occurs from mid-June to mid-July.

Main characters * Drew Allison Carey (Drew Carey) ‚Äì Drew Carey is the main protagonist of the series. A perpetual \\"nice guy\\", for most of the series, he works in the human resources department of Winfred-Louder, a multinational department store chain. Drew is the founder and co-owner of Buzz Beer, a coffee-flavored caffeinated beer (at the time, such drinks were legal but uncommon in the United States). He has a long-standing feud with co-worker Mimi Bobeck; both play endless, occasionally complicated, seriously mean- spirited pranks on each other until she becomes his sister-in-law, after which they still dislike each other. * Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney) ‚Äì Mimi Bobeck is Mr. Wick's assistant/secretary and the main antagonist of the series. Much like Fonzie from Happy Days and Steve Urkel from Family Matters, the Mimi character was originally a one-time character, only appearing in the pilot episode.http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-drew-carey-show-reunion/ She is an overweight woman who wears a lot of makeup, yet has a very high but unstable self-esteem. (As an in-joke, Mimi's mother was played by known makeup addict and connoisseur Tammy Faye Bakker.) Mimi is Drew's nemesis; she vowed to make Drew's life a living hell after Drew denied her a job based on her makeup. Mimi's pranks included gluing Drew's hand to a pornographic magazine, covering Drew's desk with garbage, and eventually sending Drew to China while he is unconscious. She is also known for calling him \\"Pig\\" and \\"Doughboy.\\" Mimi's past has a lot of connections to the world of music; she often talks about being a roadie for Foghat and was married to Eddie Money for two weeks after appearing at his first concert. Additionally, she claims to have slept with both Joe Walsh and Peter Frampton. Later on, Mimi becomes more of a friend to Drew (they agree to put their feud on hold while Mimi dates and later marries his brother, Steve) and a loving, if unconventional, mother to Gus. Early in the series, it was revealed that Mimi was Catholic and of Polish ancestry, and inherited the title of Duchess of Krak√≥w after her aunt died. (Starting in 2009, Mimi/Kinney resurfaced as a guest on The Price is Right, hosted by Drew Carey since October 15, 2007, during the show's April Fool's episode, first in 2009 as a model and then ransacking Mike Richards' position as executive producer on the show, in 2010. Carey usually promotes Kinney's next project during the closing of that episode.) * Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) ‚Äì Forms a double-act with Oswald. Lewis, who is tall, gangly, and perpetually bemused. Ryan Stiles once described Lewis as \\"Not even a character at first, just a creep really.\\" He possesses an IQ of 162, but works as a janitor for a company called DrugCo, which conducts bizarre experiments. Due to accidentally releasing a strain of bacteria into the population, he was busted down to janitor from a position that required him to wear a lab coat. At one point, he posed as Drew to take his physical exam for him, unexpectedly taking a psychiatric exam as well. He tried to give answers which he thought suited Drew's life and situation, and the results showed him to be mentally unstable and possibly criminally insane. He mentioned in one episode he was adopted. * Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) ‚Äì Lewis's slightly shorter, dark-haired friend is the dumb one of the double-act, which tends to be his most distinguishing characteristic. Lewis described him once as a \\"man-child stuck in a sort of prolonged adolescence.\\" Oswald was a deejay at the beginning of the first season but later on became a delivery driver for Global Parcel (a fictional package-delivery service whose uniforms are modeled after those of UPS). He later attempted to become a nurse, but he failed the required tests. Drew later got him a job as a delivery man for Never Ending Store, but Oswald was injured on store property. After receiving damages, he bought the Warsaw. In the episode Bus-ted, it is revealed that Oswald joined the group of friends to replace Adam, a childhood friend who fell through the ice on a lake. Aside from Carey, Bader is the only cast member to appear in every episode of the series. * Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) ‚Äì Friends with Drew, Lewis, and Oswald since they were kids. Kate is a bit of a tomboy and a hothead and good with her fists. She and Oswald almost got married at one point, but she called it off just after Oswald threw her a surprise wedding (essentially leaving Oswald at the altar). She later found out about Drew's long-standing crush on her at their high school reunion, and she realized that she had feelings for him too. They dated for a season (even becoming engaged) but broke up when they disagreed about having kids. Drew and Kate were married for a short time in a later season, although this was illegal, as Drew had just become married to his old girlfriend, Nicki. Eventually, Drew's sham was discovered and Kate felt betrayed. Drew eventually regained Kate's trust and they became friends again. Kate left at the beginning of the eighth season, marrying a Naval aviator and moving from Cleveland to Guam. * Nigel Algernon Wick (Craig Ferguson) ‚Äì Drew's boss after the first season, replacing Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak). English, crude, boisterous and offensive, he was also a cocaine addict before he was forced to go into rehab. For some time, he and Drew were in a same-sex marriage (technically a civil union) in order for Mr. Wick to get his green card and Drew to get his job back. When he first appeared on stage in guest episodes in the last two seasons he was greeted with thunderous applause. Wick always had unusual methods of firing employees (usually men surnamed Johnson), which he does in most episodes. He is almost always referred to as \\"Mr. Wick\\", and his first name, Nigel, is rarely used. In the show's first April Fool's Day episode, Wick was shot in the crotch with a crossbow by an employee (named Johnson) whom he had just fired. Wick had to have one of his testicles removed. Wick also lost a toe and a nipple in a fox hunt that went terribly wrong. Craig Ferguson initially auditioned at Warner Bros. for a role as a Hispanic photographer on Suddenly Susan, and after he failed his audition, the casting director referred him to The Drew Carey Show which was auditioning across the studio. Ferguson, who is Scottish, played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent \\"to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents.\\" At the end of one episode, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent. * Steve Carey (John Carroll Lynch) ‚Äì Drew's straight but cross-dressing older brother. He came to Cleveland and got a job in the cosmetics department at Winfred-Louder. He fell in love with Mimi and after one season of dating they married in a ceremony in Drew's backyard, with Drew officiating along with an online minister from an Internet website. In later seasons the concept of Steve being a cross-dresser is abandoned entirely with little explanation (though it is hinted that he gave it up to make Mimi happy). He left, along with Kate and Wick, early in the eighth season. John Carroll Lynch is in reality 5 years younger than Drew Carey. * Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) ‚Äì Drew's childhood friend. She has had a crush on Drew since high school but never told him. She was married but her husband cheated on her with her sister. Her mother is an alcoholic and leaves her father, eventually hooking up with Lewis. After Kate leaves, Drew realizes that he loves Kellie. Drew is afraid to tell Kellie because it may ruin their friendship like it did with Kate. After Lily leaves Drew, they confess their feelings for each other. When Kellie comes out while Drew is talking to his dad and asks Drew what they are going to do about their feelings for each other, Drew's dad falls off the roof and dies. Eventually during the beginning stage of their relationship Kellie finds out she is pregnant with Drew Jr. but won't marry Drew because she doesn't think he is ready for marriage. During the finale she decides Drew is ready. But her water breaks and she and Drew get married right when the baby is born. Drew's marriages Much of the show's humor revolved around Drew's single life (in real life, Drew was engaged for the first time in 2007, shortly after becoming a game show host). However, Drew was married a number of times during the show's run. His spouses during the series were: * Diane (Nicole Sullivan) ‚Äì A cocktail waitress Drew met on a business trip to Las Vegas. She tricked Drew into marrying her because she believed having a husband would give her an edge in winning custody of her children. Drew agreed to help her with the social workers, and they divorced a week later. * Mr. Wick (Craig Ferguson) - Drew's boss for the majority of the series, desperately wanted a spouse when his visa expired and he was threatened with deportation. He bribed Drew with a promotion and several benefits to get Drew to marry him in Vermont. They stayed married for just over a year to throw off any suspicion from the INS. Drew kicked Mr. Wick out of his house once Wick became too \\"clingy\\" with Drew's friends and life. * Nicki Fifer (Kate Walsh) - A real estate agent whom Drew dated and became engaged to; she dumped him after gaining a large amount of weight while they were dating (and, in her own words, \\"couldn't be with a man who loved to eat\\"). She lost the weight, got married and came back to Drew after her divorce (when Drew had just left a mental institution). Drew asked her to marry him on an impulse, and she agreed. Unfortunately, Drew married Kate soon after (thus becoming a bigamist) and she left him. Nicki returned later, having regained all her previous weight, and attempted to kill Drew because she blamed him for all the recent problems in her life. Drew let Nicki stay at his house until she could get back on her feet, after which she was rarely seen again. Lewis helped her through something. He tried to have a relationship with her, but she refused. * Kate ‚Äì The love of Drew's life and his best friend since childhood, Drew and Kate first broke off their engagement after a disagreement about having kids. After Drew's stint in the mental hospital, Kate realized that she still loved Drew and asked him to marry her. Drew agreed (despite having recently married Nicki and still being married to Mr. Wick) and kept both his marriages a secret for a time. Both wives discovered the situation, and Kate, furious, dumped Drew and told the newspapers about the situation; Drew became known as \\"The Impotent Bisexual Bigamist.\\" * Lily (Tammy Lauren) ‚Äì A Southern belle who met Drew after Oswald and Lewis started a campaign to find him a wife. Drew brought Lily to Cleveland and attempted to establish a relationship with her, but found it difficult to deal with Lily's night terrors. Drew ended up proposing to Lily on three different occasions: once in his house, another in a movie theater, and finally, back at his home again. After Drew tore up all of his pre-determined wedding plan receipts, Lily agreed to marry him. Lily left Drew after the wedding, driving off without him after giving Drew his ring back. At the reception, Drew and Kellie expressed their hidden love for each other and began their relationship, which would also lead to Drew's final marriage. * Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) ‚Äì Drew's childhood friend who was introduced in the eighth season. Drew went to a strip club and discovered that Kellie was working as a stripper to support herself after her divorce from her husband. Drew takes her into his home and their friendship blossoms. They were both reluctant to confess their feelings for each other, but they became a couple after Drew and Lily's wedding. Kellie soon becomes pregnant, but refuses to marry Drew for another eight months. On their wedding day and the series finale, Kellie gave birth to Drew Jr. Other characters * Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) ‚Äì One of Drew's co-workers, Larry is a bumbling and somewhat unprofessional employee who is often willing to resort to less than savory methods to gain the upper hand. During a competition to determine the new employee representative on the Winfred-Louder board of directors, he managed to obtain the position by having sex with Mrs. Louder, a practice he repeats several times after being dumped by his wife. He loses his job on the board shortly after receiving the promotion, but continues his secret relationship with Mrs. Louder. He also ends up in jail for selling drugs, but is released and continues his job at the department store. After leaving Winfred-Louder, he set up a reasonably successful dating service which later expanded into a television chat show. * Gerald Hawthorne Bell (Kevin Pollak) ‚Äì Drew's boss for the show's first season. Mr. Bell only appeared in person for his last appearance. He gets caught having relations with a woman in his office, and he and Mrs. Louder have to talk it out. When he appears, he is wearing a Santa costume. We only heard his voice on Drew's speakerphone, despite the fact that Drew had his desk very close to Bell's office. Little was known about him, but he behaved in a sexist and unprofessional manner, including liaisons with at least one female staffer. In the last episode of the first season, Mr. Bell finally appeared on camera as he was seen leaving his office after getting fired from the store. The running joke of his never being officially seen until this moment is referenced in dialogue when he says; \\"What's the matter, Carey? You act like you've never seen me before!\\" * Fran Louder (Nan Martin) ‚Äì Mrs. Louder is one of the executives' \\"cougars\\" and partial namesake of the Winfred-Louder corporation who originally inherited the store from her dead husband. She is the CEO of the company that owns the department store, and retains her position even after the corporation is bought out by a larger company located in Amsterdam. As the head of the store, she thinks very little of Drew, and openly expresses surprise at the assertion that he still has dreams of becoming more successful, Mrs. Louder occasionally gives him minor promotions throughout the series, but his personality clashes with her ruthless and businesslike nature. She is somewhat sex-obsessed and conducts a long affair with the boorish, lazy, and obnoxious Larry Almada, played by Ian Gomez. (In another episode we learn Almada is superendowed sexually.) Mrs. Louder is last seen accompanying Mimi and Steve on their honeymoon (she advises them that she is a voyeur but they are forced to take her with them, anyway). She is removed from power shortly after when a member of the board improvises a speech slurring ethnic groups and gays. The insulted employees begin to riot, gaining the attention of the bosses in Amsterdam, who replace the entire board of directors except, for some reason, for Mr. Wick. * Robert Soulard (Mark Curry) ‚Äì One of Drew's bosses at Winfred-Louder, Mr. Soulard was appointed by the Dutch as Mrs. Louder's replacement after the latter was fired along with the original board of directors. Slightly more open-minded than his predecessor, Mr. Soulard agrees to listen to the employees after he is made the new boss, and quickly appoints Drew to be the new Store Manager when Mr. Wick's incompetence gets him sent to Toledo for retraining. * Beulah Carey (Marion Ross) ‚Äì Drew's and Steve's mother, married to George Carey (Stanley Anderson). George Carey dies towards the end of the series' run, although not due to the death of the actor. * Kim Harvey (Adrienne Barbeau) ‚Äì Oswald's mother, who wears tight clothes and sweaters with plunging necklines. Her sexiness caused the young Drew in his childhood to commit some embarrassing faux pas. * King Augustus Antonio Carey (Dakota and Ryan Williams) ‚Äì Gus is Steve and Mimi's son as well as Drew's nephew, who saved Mimi from being fired by Drew in the episode \\"Drew Pops Something On Kate\\". Just as Drew is about to fire Mimi, he kicks while in the womb for the first time, causing him to feel compassion for Mimi and preventing him from firing her. Gus was born while Drew was in a coma, and his spirit (voiced by Jon Polito) met Drew up in Heaven before being born. After hearing Drew make jokes about how horrible Mimi was, Gus was afraid to be born. Drew convinced him that Mimi would be a good mother by going back down to Earth and spending time in the baby's body. Drew told this story to the others after coming out of his coma, but nobody believed him. Gus was an infant for most of his time on the show, but received an age boost (putting him somewhere between 5 and 6 years old) for the final season (played by Matthew Josten). He burns down his house, initially thought to be with a wood-burning kit that Drew gives him as a gift. Since Mimi and Gus had nowhere to live, Drew offers his home to them, and they stay there almost until the end of the show. It was later discovered that Gus was a pyromaniac and intentionally started a fire in the house. * Lisa Robbins (Katy Selverstone) ‚Äì Drew's girlfriend from season one, she is prevented from dating him as the rules at Winfred-Louder do not allow management to participate in romantic relationships with their employees. Although this initially forces them to hide their relationship in public, they eventually find a way to overcome this obstacle. She vies for a job as the head of the personal shopper department to become a member of the store's management, prompting a competition with fellow applicants Kate and Mimi. Lisa begins dating Drew after she gets the job, but after a failed attempt to live together they agree to break up. She leaves her dog, Speedy, behind to stay with him and departs for good after her marriage in the second season. * Lord Mercer (Jim Piddock) ‚Äì An extremely wealthy Englishman, who bought Winfred- Louder and became the new owner after the Dutch divested themselves of the company/store(s). He also brings back Mr. Wick, saying only Englishmen know how to run a business: despite this, he once put his teenybopper daughter Milan (Jessica Cauffiel) in charge of Winfred-Lauder. * Christine Watson (Wanda Sykes) ‚Äì Hired to replace Nigel Wick as manager, falls in love with Drew. * Jay Clemens (Robert Torti) ‚Äì Kate's handsome boyfriend from season one. * Evan (Kyle Howard) ‚Äì Co-owner of Never Ending Store with his brother, Scott (of the two bosses, he is regarded as the 'nice' one). He is a Zen- seeking Buddhist who promotes peace and support, although he himself has a life coach, sees a family therapist with his brother, and takes anti-anxiety pills. He has a tenuous relationship with Scott because they spend so much time together. * Scott (Jonathan Mangum) ‚Äì Co-owner of Never Ending Store with his brother, Evan. He is more business-minded than Evan, and can get very irritated by Evan's peace-seeking way of life. He teaches computer classes during the summer. * Mrs. Wick (Richard Chamberlain) ‚Äì Nigel Wick's \\"Mum\\" Maggie, played by Chamberlain in drag. The character is clearly promiscuous, young Nigel having grown up with a series of \\"uncles\\" in and out of his life. * Chuck (Kelly Perine) ‚Äì Security Guard/Head of Security at Winfred-Louder. Chuck is a fellow employee at Winfred-Louder who seems to have a friendly relationship with Drew, as he, in his first appearance in the episode \\"No Two Things Are Exactly Alike\\" in Season 1, he tips Drew to the person who complained about a fellow employee who became offended at a sexually offensive cartoon which he put on a memo in the hopes of boosting company morale. In Chuck's final appearance in the Season 5 episode \\"Drew and the Racial Tension Play\\", Chuck is among the many minority employees who become offended at the socially insensitive comments of senior company board member Arthur Crawford (Hansford Rowe) who try to solicit Drew to get Crawford to apologize for his comments or resign.

Obeah is difficult to define, as it is not a single, unified set of practices; the word \\"Obeah\\" was historically not often used to describe one's own practices.Maarit Forde and Diana Paton, \\"Introduction\\", in Obeah and Other Powers: The Politics of Caribbean Religion and Healing, ed. Diana Paton and Maarit Forde (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 10. Diana Paton has contended that what constitutes Obeah in Jamaica has been constructed by white society, particularly law enforcement.Diana Paton, \\"The Trials of Inspector Thomas: Policing and Ethnography in Jamaica,\\" in Obeah and Other Powers: The Politics of Caribbean Religion and Healing, ed. Diana Paton and Maarit Forde (Durham: Duke University Press, 2012), 173‚Äì74. Accordingly, different Afro-Caribbean communities use their own terminology to describe the practice, such as \\"spell casting\\", among the Jamaican Windward Maroons.Jenny Sharpe, Ghosts of Slavery: A Literary Archeology of Black Women's Lives (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2003), 3. Obeah is similar to other African diaspora religions such as Palo, Haitian Vodou, Santer√≠a, and Hoodoo in that it includes communication with ancestors and spirits and healing rituals. Nevertheless, it differs from religions like Vodou and Santeria in that there is no explicit canon of gods or deities that is worshipped, and the practice is generally an individual action rather than part of a collective ceremony or offering.Margarite Fern√°ndez Olmos and Lizabeth Paravisini-Gilbert, \\"Introduction\\", in Sacred Possessions: Vodou, Santeria, Obeah and the Caribbean (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1997), 6. According to some early colonial accounts, Obeah differed from Myal in that Obeah was viewed as nefarious while Myal was a more positive influence.Paul Easterling, \\"The Ifa‚Äô Diaspora: The Art of Syncretism, Part 5 ‚Äì Obeah and Myal\\" in (Afrometrics.org, 2017), 173-74. However, this denigration of Obeah as negative in relation to \\"positive\\" forms of religion in the Caribbean has been challenged by a number of scholars who emphasize Obeah's empowering or justice-making capabilities.https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo50271449.html J.

Brent Crosson, Experiments with Power: Obeah and the Remaking of Religion in Trinidad (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2020) and the Virgin Islands, as well as by the Igbo people of Nigeria. In some cases, aspects of these folk religions have survived through syncretism with Christian symbolism and practice introduced by European colonials and slave owners. Origins In parts of the Caribbean where Obeah developed, slaves were taken from a variety of African nations with differing spiritual practices and religions. It is from these arrivals and their spiritualisms that Obeah originates. The origins of the word \\"Obeah\\" have been contested in the academic community for nearly a century; there is not a widely accepted consensus on what region or language the word derives from, and there are politics behind every hypothesis. Orlando Patterson promoted an Akan-Twi etymology, suggesting that the word came from Gold Coast communities.Diana Paton, The Cultural Politics of Obeah: Religion, Colonialism, and Modernity in the Caribbean World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015), 28. In colonial British communities, aside from referring to the set of spiritual practices, ‚ÄúObeah‚Äù also came to refer to a physical object, such as a talisman or charm, that was used for evil magical purposes. The item was referred to as an Obeah-item (e.g. an 'obeah ring' or an 'obeah-stick', translated as: ring used for witchcraft or stick used for witchcraft respectively). Obeah incorporated various beliefs from the religions of later migrants to the colonies where it was present. Obeah also influenced other religions in the Caribbean, e.g. Christianity, which incorporated some Obeah beliefs. =Akan origin hypothesis= He and other proponents of the Akan-Twi hypothesis argued that the word was derived from obayifo, a word associated with malevolent magic by Ashanti priests.Nathaniel Samuel Murrell, Obeah: Magical Art of Resistance. In Afro-Caribbean Religions: An Introduction to Their Historical, Cultural, and Sacred Traditions (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2010), 231. (). Kwasi Konadu suggested a somewhat updated version of this etymology, suggesting that bayi, the neutral force used by the obayifo, is the source material ‚Äì a word with a slightly less negative connotation.Paton, Cultural Politics, 28. The first time in Jamaican history the term \\"obeah\\" was used in the colonial literature was in reference to Nanny of the Maroons, an Akan woman, considered the ancestor of the Windward Maroon community and celebrated for her role in defeating the British and securing a land treaty in 1739, as an old 'witch' and a 'Hagg'.Philip Thicknesse, Memoirs and anecdotes of Philip Thicknesse, late lieutenant governor of Land Guard Fort, and unfortunately father to George Touchet, Baron Audley (Dublin: Graisberry and Campbell, 1790), 77. Obeah has also received a great deal of attention for its role in Tacky‚Äôs Rebellion (also an Akan), the 1760 conflict that spurred the passage of the first Jamaican anti-Obeah law.British Parliament, \\"An Act to remedy the evils arising from irregular assemblies of Slaves, and to prevent their possessing arms and ammunition, and going from place to place without tickets, and for preventing the practice of obeah, and to restrain overseers from leaving the estates under their care on certain days, and to oblige all free negroes, mulattoes or Indians, to register their names in the vestry-books of the respective parishes of this Island, and to carry about them the certificate, and wear the badge of their freedom; and to prevent any captain, master or supercargo of any vessel bringing back Slaves transported off this Island,\\" in CO 139/21, The National Archives, UK. The term \\"Myal\\" was first recorded by Edward Long in 1774 when describing a ritual dance done by Jamaican slaves. At first the practices of Obeah and Myal were not considered different. Over time \\"Myal-men\\" involved in spirit affairs involved themselves with Jamaican Native Baptist churches, bringing Myal rituals into the churches. Over time these Myal influenced churches began preaching the importance of baptisms and the eradication of Obeah, thus formally separating the two traditions. =Igbo origin hypothesis= Despite its associations with a number of Akan slaves and rebellions, the origin of Obeah has been criticised by several writers who hold that an Igbo origin is more likely. According to W. E. B. Du Bois Institute database, he traces Obeah to the Dibia or Obia () traditions of the Igbo people. Specialists in Obia (also spelled Obea) were known as Ndi Obia () and practised the same activities as the Obeah men and women of the Caribbean like predicting the future and manufacturing charms. Among the Igbo there were oracles known as Obi·∫° which were said to be able to talk. Parts of the Caribbean where Obeah was most active imported a large number of its slaves from the Igbo-dominated Bight of Biafra. This interpretation is also favored by Kenneth Bilby, arguing that ‚Äúdibia‚Äô connotes a neutral ‚Äúmaster of knowledge and wisdom.‚ÄùPaton, Cultural Politics, 29. =Efik origin hypothesis= In another hypothesis, the Efik language is the root of Obeah where the word obeah comes from the Efik ubio meaning 'a bad omen'. Melville Herskovits endorsed a different Efik origin, arguing that obeah was a corruption of an Efik word for ‚Äúdoctor.‚Äù History =Beginnings= Obeah figure confiscated from a black man named Alexander Ellis on his arrest in suspicion of practicing as an 'obeah-man' in Morant Bay, Jamaica in 1887. Both of which were Akan speakers or \\"Coromantee\\". The term 'Obeah' is first found in documents from the early 18th century, as in its connection to Nanny of the Maroons. Colonial sources referred to the spiritual powers attributed to her in a number of derogatory ways, ranging from referring to her as ‚Äúthe rebel‚Äôs old obeah woman‚ÄùSharpe, 3. to characterizing her as ‚Äúunsexed‚Äù and more bloodthirsty than Maroon men.Herbert T. Thomas, Untrodden Jamaica (Kingston, Jamaica: A.W. Gardner, 1890), 36. Maroon oral traditions discuss her feats of science in rich detail. She is said to have used her obeah powers to kill British soldiers in Nanny‚Äôs Pot, a boiling pot without a flame below it that soldiers would lean into and fall in,Sharpe, 7. to quickly grow food for her starving forces,Kenneth M. Bilby, True Born Maroons (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2005), 253. and to catch British bullets and either fire them back or attack the soldiers with a machete.Bilby, 211. Discussion of Obeah became even more frequent when it was made illegal in Jamaica after Tacky's War. During the rebellion, Tacky is said to have consulted an Obeahman who prepared for his forces a substance that would protect them from British bullets, which boosted their confidence in executing the rebellion.Jones, James Athearn (1831), Haverill, or memoirs of an officer in the army of Wolfe (J.J & Harper), p. 199.

Akinwumi Ogundiran and Paula Sanders (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2014), 145. In 1787 a letter to an English newspaper referred to \\"Obiu-women\\" interpreting the wishes of the dead at the funeral of a murdered slave in Jamaica: a footnote explained the term as meaning \\"Wise-women\\".BECARA, i. e. White Man. \\"To the Editor of the Universal Register.\\" Times [London, England] 23 Nov. 1787: 1. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012. The practice of obeah with regards to healing led to the Jamaican 18th and 19th century traditions of \\"doctresses\\", such as Grace Donne, who nursed her lover, Simon Taylor (sugar planter), Sarah Adams, Cubah Cornwallis and Mary Seacole and her mother. These doctresses practised the use of hygiene and the applications of herbs decades before they were adopted by European doctors and nurses.Christer Petley, White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), pp. 88-9. =Discrimination= A continuing source of white anxiety related to Obeah was the belief that practitioners were skilled in using poisons, as mentioned in Matthew Lewis's Journal of a West India Proprietor. Many white Jamaicans accused women of such poisonings; one case Lewis discussed was that of a young woman named Minetta who was brought to trial for attempting to poison her master.Matthew G. Lewis, Journal of a West India Proprietor, 1815-1817, Edited with an introduction by Mona Wilson (London: G. Routledge & Sons Ltd., 1929), 149-150. Lewis and others often characterized the women they accused of poisonings as being manipulated by Obeahmen, who they contended actually provided the women with the materials for poisonings.Sasha Turner Bryson, ‚ÄúThe Art of Power: Poison and Obeah Accusations and the Struggle for Dominance and Survival in Jamaica‚Äôs Slave Society,‚Äù Caribbean Studies 41, no. 2 (2013): 63. The laws forbidding Obeah reflected this fear: an anti-Obeah law passed in Barbados in 1818 specifically forbade the possession of \\"any poison, or any noxious or destructive substance\\".\\"Colonial Intelligence.\\" Times [London, England]. 5 Dec. 1818: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012. A doctor who examined the medicine chest of an Obeah man arrested in Jamaica in 1866 identified white arsenic as one of the powders in it, but could not identify the others. The unnamed correspondent reporting this affirmed \\"The Jamaica herbal is an extensive one, and comprises some highly poisonous juices, of which the Obeah men have a perfect knowledge.\\"OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. \\"The Outbreak In Jamaica.\\" Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 11 June 2012 During the mid 19th century the appearance of a comet in the sky became the focal point of an outbreak of religious fanatical millennialism among the Myal men of Jamaica. Spiritualism was at that time sweeping the English-speaking nations as well, and it readily appealed to those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, as spirit contact, especially with the dead, is an essential part of many African religions. During the conflict between Myal and Obeah, the Myal men positioned themselves as the \\"good\\" opponents to \\"evil\\" Obeah.\\"The Obeah men are hired to revenge some man's wrong, while Myal men profess to undo the work of Obeah men and to cure those subject to Obeah alarms.\\" OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. \\"The Outbreak In Jamaica.\\" Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012. They claimed that Obeah men stole people's shadows, and they set themselves up as the helpers of those who wished to have their shadows restored. Myal men contacted spirits in order to expose the evil works they ascribed to the Obeah men, and led public parades which resulted in crowd- hysteria that engendered violent antagonism against Obeah men. The public \\"discovery\\" of buried Obeah charms, presumed to be of evil intent, led on more than one occasion to violence against the rival Obeah practitioners. Such conflicts between supposedly ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúevil‚Äù spiritual work could sometimes be found within plantation communities. In one 1821 case brought before court in Berbice, an enslaved woman named Madalon allegedly died as a result of being accused of malevolent obeah that caused the drivers at Op Hoop Van Beter plantation to fall ill.Randy M. Browne, ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòBad Business‚Äô of Obeah: Power, Authority, and the Politics of Slave Culture in the British Caribbean,‚Äù William and Mary Quarterly 68, no. 3 (2011): 451. The man implicated in her death, a spiritual worker named Willem, conducted an illegal Minje Mama dance to divine the source of the Obeah, and after she was chosen as the suspect, she was tortured to death.Browne, 469-73. Laws were passed that limited both Obeah and Myal traditions.In 1818 The Times reported the passing of an act by the House of Assembly in Barbados against the practice of Obeah, which carried the penalty of death or transportation for those convicted. \\"Colonial Intelligence.\\" Times [London, England] 5 Dec. 1818: 2. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 7 June 2012. Influence =Trinidad and Tobago= Trinidad and Tobago Obeah includes the unique practice of the Moko-Jumbie, or stilt dancer. Moko was a common word for Ibibio slaves. In the Trinidad and Tobago Obeah tradition, a Douen is a child who has died before being baptized, and is said to be forced to forever walk the earth at night in English-speaking regions of the Caribbean. Jewelry is made from deadly toxic red and black seeds called jumbies, jumbie eyes or jumbie beads (seeds of Abrus precatorius) in the Caribbean and South America. By contrast, the moko-jumbie of Trinidad and Tobago is brightly colored, dances in the daylight, and is very much alive. The moko-jumbie also represents the flip side of spiritual darkness, as stilt-dancing is most popular around holy days and Carnival. Obeah in the Bahamas Currently, the Bahamian Penal Code (Chapter 84: Sections 232-234) allows for up to 3 months of incarceration for practicing obeah. Interestingly, suspicion of possessing an instrument of obeah (vials, blood, bone, images) while in a courtroom, can result in immediate search without warrant and a fine where such item is found. Obeah Laws In Trinidad Trinidad has similar laws like Jamaica for Obeah as a crime. Trinidad did not have as many cases of people practicing Obeah compared to Jamaica. In Trinidad, there was discrimination of what was a religion practice or what was considered Obeah. The reason for this is the cultural differences of the Blacks and East Indian race living in Trinidad and Tobago (Page 68). These laws containing to obeah was set from the British laws. England ruled many island in the Caribbean included Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. In Trinidad, 13 percent of East Indian people also known as \\"coolie\\" made up the population of people being convicted of obeah. In Jamaica, where there wasn't a high population of East Indian people, there was only 4 percent of prosecution for the crimes of obeah. In Jamaica and Trinidad there was more people that believed that the East Indian descendants were known to be affiliated with being an \\"obeahman\\" because of their spiritual practices, that are connected to their religion. Some of those religions are Hindu and Muslim. People that were convicted of obeah in Trinidad has serve six months as a maximum punishment. These two countries had other smaller punishments like fines or lashes. Lashes are beatings that the person being convicted of obeah would receive with whips. These lashes would also be reported in how many lashes the person would receive in documents. =Literature= Although 19th-century literature mentions Obeah often, one of the earliest references to Obeah in fiction can be found in 1800, in William Earle's novel Obi; or, The History of Three- Finger'd Jack, a narrative inspired by true events that was also reinterpreted in several dramatic versions on the London stage in 1800 and following.Obi One of the next major books about Obeah was Hamel, the Obeah Man (1827). Several early plantation novels also include Obeah plots. In Marryat's novel Poor Jack (1840) a rich young plantation-ownerDescribed as a 'curly-headed Creole', possibly intended to be mixed-race. F. Marryat, Poor Jack, Chapter XLI. ridicules superstitions held by English sailors but himself believes in Obeah. The 20th century saw less actual Obeah in open practice, but it still continued to make frequent appearances in literature.

His life had three main phases, representing a progression in his thinking: a Zionist phase (c. 1883 ‚Äì c. 1900); a Jewish cultural autonomy phase (c. 1900 ‚Äì c. 1914) which included the promotion of the Yiddish language; and religious phase (c. 1914‚Äì1937) when he turned to Orthodox Judaism and became staunchly anti-Zionist.  Biography  Nathan Birnbaum was born in Vienna into an Eastern European Jewish family with roots in Austrian Galicia and Hungary.\\"Birnbaum, Nathan\\" (2007). Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Vol. 3. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. pp. 714-716. His father, Menachem Mendel Birnbaum, a merchant, hailed from Ropshitz, Galicia, and his mother, Miriam Birnbaum (n√©e Seelenfreund), who was born in northern Hungary (in a region sometimes called the Carpathian Rus), of a family with illustrious rabbinic lineage, had moved as a child to Tarnow, Galicia, where the two met and married.Olson, Jess (2013). Nathan Birnbaum and Jewish Modernity: Architect of Zionism, Yiddishism, and Orthodoxy. Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press. pp. 17‚Äì21.Menachem Mendel Birnbaum died when Nathan was eleven. He attended a public high school and gradually drifted away from religious observance but strongly believed in the idea of Jews as a nation.Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe, Robert S. Wistrich From 1882 to 1886, Birnbaum studied law, philosophy and Near Eastern studies at the University of Vienna. He married Rosa Korngut (1869‚Äì1934) and they had three sons: Solomon (Salomo) Birnbaum (1891‚Äì1989), Menachem Birnbaum (1893‚Äì1944), and Uriel Birnbaum (1894‚Äì1956). In 1933, at the time of the Nazi rise to power, Birnbaum and his wife, together with their son Menachem (an artist) and family, who at that time were all living in Berlin, fled to Scheveningen, Netherlands, with the help of businessman and diplomat Henri B. van Leeuwen (1888-1973). There, Birnbaum, van Leeuwen, and banker Daniel Wolfe published the anti-Zionist newspaper Der Ruf (\\"The Call\\"). (Menachem and his family were murdered by the Nazis in 1944.) At the same time, their son Solomon (Professor of Yiddish and Hebrew paleography) and his family fled from Hamburg to England. Their other son, Uriel, an artist and poet, and his family fled from Vienna to the Netherlands in 1939. Van Leeuwen, also an Orthodox Jew, became a Dutch anti-Zionist leader and Bergen-Belsen survivor.Jews backing academic boycott against Israel Birnbaum died in Scheveningen in 1937 after a period of severe illness.  Zionist activism  Street named for Nathan Birnbaum, Jerusalem, Israel In 1883, at the age of 19, he founded Kadimah, the first Jewish (Zionist) student association in Vienna, many years before Theodor Herzl became the leading spokesman of the Zionist movement. While still a student, he founded and published the periodical Selbstemanzipation!,\\"Self-Emancipation!\\" 1885‚Äì1894, with some interruptions, renamed 1894 \\"Juedische Volkszeitung\\" often written in large part by Birnbaum himself. In it he coined the terms \\"Zionistic\\", \\"Zionist\\", \\"Zionism\\" (1890), and \\"political Zionism\\" (1892).Alex Bein, Herzl Year Book vol. II, p. 6, New York, 1959 Birnbaum played a prominent part in the First Zionist Congress (1897) where he was elected Secretary-General of the Zionist Organization. He was associated with and was one of the most important representatives of the cultural, rather than political, side of Zionism. However, he left the Zionist Organization not long after the Congress. He was unhappy with its negative view of Diaspora Jewry and the transformation of the Zionist ideals into a party machine. His next phase was to advocate Jewish cultural autonomy, or Golus nationalism, concentrating in particular on the Jews of eastern Europe. He advocated for the Jews to be recognized as a people among the other peoples of the empire, with Yiddish as their official language. He ran (in Buczacz, eastern Galicia) on behalf of the Jews (and with the support of the local Ukrainians) as candidate for the Austrian parliament. Although he had a majority of the votes, his election was thwarted by corruption of the electoral process by the local Polish faction. He was chief convener of the Conference for the Yiddish Language held in Czernowitz, August 30 ‚ÄìSeptember 3, 1908. It was the first Yiddish-language conference ever to take place. At the conference, he took the place of his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist Sholem Aleichem who was critically ill.First Yiddish Language Conference. Louis Fridhandler, Two roads to Yiddishism (Nathan Birnbaum and Sholem Aleichem) Religious orthodoxy From about 1912 onwards, Birnbaum became increasingly interested in Orthodox Judaism, and he became a fully observant Orthodox Jew in about 1916. He continued to act particularly as an advocate for the Jews of eastern Europe and the Yiddish language. From 1919 to 1922, he was General Secretary of the Agudas Yisroel, a widely-spread and influential Orthodox Jewish organization. He founded the society of the \\"Olim\\" (Hebrew for the \\"Ascenders\\"), a society with a specific program of action dedicated to the spiritual ascent of the Jewish people.

It is in the ancient region of Formartine. Its name is believed to derive from the Gaelic term Eilean, an island, on account of the presence of an island in the River Ythan, which offered a convenient fording point.Aberdeenshire Towns Partnership accessed 5 September 2009  Places of interest  Places of interest within the town include the ruins of Ellon Castle, surrounded by walls known as the Deer Dyke, and the Auld Brig, a category A listed bridge across the Ythan, built in 1793 and still in use as a pedestrian bridge. The Riverside Park offers walkways alongside the Ythan, from which herons, salmon, trout and otters may be observed. In 2013, a new eco-brewery, owned and crowdfunded by BrewDog, was opened in a greenfield site just outside of Ellon.  Education  The town has three primary schools: * Ellon Primary School * Auchterellon Primary School * Meiklemill Primary School Each of these schools has some type of greenspace as well as a concrete playground. These schools feed into Ellon Academy, the local secondary school, which currently has a roll of about 1200 students; however, due to ongoing residential development in the area that figure is expected to rise. A new school (Ellon Academy) was opened in July 2015, on the outskirts of Ellon.  Leisure  Ellon has a community centre, which includes a swimming pool and caf√©.Located in the new Ellon Academy. Ellon Swimming Pool & Community Centre The Ythan Centre was a building dedicated to serving the needs of Ellon's teenage population. It is currently being used by Ellon Baptist Church who, from January 2019, began a five year lease on the property which had been unoccupied since February 2016. The Meadows sports centre, located on the outskirts of Ellon, has many sporting facilities and clubs, including football and rugby pitches, an astroturf pitch for hockey, a gym, and a multi-use sports hall. The Meadows is also home to Ellon United football team, the Ellon Rugby Club and Ellon Hockey Club.  Media  The town has two weekly newspapers: the Ellon Times, published on Thursdays by Angus County Press and the Ellon Advertiser, published on Fridays by Peters of Turriff.  Housing  Ellon has benefited from the North Sea oil demand, and is one of the main dormitory towns for Aberdeen. It is part of the proposed Energetica corridor of development.Energetica The population is expanding as young families seek to escape Aberdeen and move to nearby towns like Ellon, Inverurie and Banchory. During 2006, Ellon ranked as the town with the fourth most rapidly increasing average house prices in Scotland.  Transport  Ellon is bypassed by the A90 road, which offers convenient access to Aberdeen to the south and Peterhead and Fraserburgh to the north. Other major road links are the A920 west to Oldmeldrum and Huntly, and the A948 north to New Deer. Regular and frequent bus services link Ellon with Aberdeen, Inverurie, Peterhead, Fraserburgh and surrounding towns and villages, serving both the town centre and the large Park and Ride facility at the eastern edge of the town.Park and Ride details accessed 5 September 2009 Ellon railway station was a principal station on the Great North of Scotland Railway line that ran from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh and Peterhead. Due to the Beeching Axe, passenger services were withdrawn on the Formartine and Buchan Railway line in 1965. Freight services continued on the line until 1979 (Fraserburgh only, the Maud-Peterhead section was closed in 1970), at which point the entire line was closed. The former railway line was purchased by Grampian Regional Council in 1981, and is now part of the National Cycling Route network. Due to the population expansion since the North Sea Oil boom, the A90 has become overloaded between Aberdeen, Ellon and Peterhead. The Aberdeen Crossrail project has looked at reopening sections of the former railway, however as of March 2009 this is still unlikely. The Boddam Branch that ran to Boddam via Cruden Bay started at Ellon. This closed in 1945.

It was the production version of the Pilot ACE, itself a cut-down version of Alan Turing's ACE.  Hardware description  The DEUCE had 1450 thermionic valves, and used mercury delay lines for its main memory; each of the 12 delay lines could store 32 instructions or data words of 32 bits each. It adopted the then high 1 megahertz clock rate of the Pilot ACE. Input/output was via Hollerith 80-column punch-card equipment. The reader read cards at the rate of 200 per minute, while the card punch rate was 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE also had an 8192-word magnetic drum for main storage. To access any of the 256 tracks of 32 words, the drum had one group of 16 read and one group of 16 write heads, each group on independent moveable arms, each capable of moving to one of 16 positions. Access time was 15 milliseconds if the heads were already in position; an additional 35 milliseconds was required if the heads had to be moved. There was no rotational delay incurred when reading from and writing to drum. Data was transferred between the drum and one of the 32-word delay lines. The DEUCE could be fitted with paper tape equipment; the reader speed was 850 characters per second, while the paper tape output speed was 25 characters per second. (The DEUCE at the University of New South Wales {UTECOM} had a Siemens teleprinter attached in 1964, giving 10 characters per second input/output). Decca magnetic tape units could also be attached. The automatic multiplier and divider operated asynchronously (that is, other instructions could be executed while the multiplier/divider unit was in operation). Two arithmetic units were provided for integer operations: one of 32 bits and another capable of performing 32-bit operations and 64-bit operations. Auto-increment and auto-decrement was provided on eight registers from about 1957. Array arithmetic and array data transfers were permitted. Compared with contemporaries such as the Manchester Mark 1, DEUCE was about ten times faster. The individual words of the quadruple registers were associated with an auto-increment/decrement facility. That facility could be used for counting and for modifying instructions (for indexing, loop control, and for changing the source or destination address of an instruction).D. G. Burnett-Hall & P. A. Samet, \\"A Programming Handbook for the Computer DEUCE\\", Royal Aircraft Establishment, Ministry of Aviation, London (England), April 1959, Technical Note M.S.38. Being a serial machine, access time to a single register was 32 microseconds, a double register 64 microseconds, and a quadruple register 128 microseconds. That for a delay line was 1024 microseconds. Instruction times were: addition, subtraction, logical operations: 64 microseconds for 32-bit words; double-precision 96 microseconds; multiplication and division 2 milliseconds. For array arithmetic and transfer operations, time per word was 33 microseconds per word for 32 words. Floating-point operations were provided by software; times: 6 milliseconds for addition and subtraction, 5¬Ω milliseconds average for multiplication, and 4¬Ω milliseconds average for division. The front panel of the DEUCE featured two CRT displays: one showed the current contents of registers, while the other showed the content of any one of the mercury delay line stores. From about 1958, seven extra delay lines could be attached, giving 224 more words of high-speed store. An IBM 528 combined reader‚Äìpunch could be substituted for the Hollerith equipment, giving the same input/output speeds, in which case the machine was called Mark II. Automatic conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD was provided on input, and the reverse operation on output, for all eighty card columns. On this equipment, reading and punching could proceed simultaneously, if required, and thus could be used for reading in a record, updating it, and then punching an updated record simultaneously with reading in the next record. With the seven extra delay lines, the DEUCE was denoted Mark IIA.  Software The principal high-level programming languages were GEORGE (General Order Generator), ALPHACODE, STEVE, TIP, GIP, and ALGOL.Brian Randell & L. J. Russell, \\"DEUCE ALGOL\\", Report W/AT 844, Atomic Power Division, English Electric Co., Whetstone, Leicester, England, Feb. 1962. Assembler language translators included ZP43 and STAC.DEUCE Library Service, \\"DEUCE STAC Programming Manual\\", English Electric Co., Ltd, Kidsgrove, Staffs, England, c. 1960. Invented by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957, GEORGE was closest to present-day programming languages. It used Reverse Polish Notation. For example, to evaluate e = ay2 \\\\+ by + c, one wrote a y dup √ó √ó b y √ó + c + (e). where \\"dup\\" duplicates the previous entry, being the same as using \\"y\\" here. GEORGE provided a 12-position accumulator as a push-down pop-up stack. Using a variable name in a program (e.g., 'd') brought the value of variable 'd' into the accumulator (i.e., pushed d onto the top-of-stack), while enclosing a name in parentheses {e.g., (d) } assigned to variable 'd' the value at the top of the stack (accumulator). To destroy (pop and discard) the value at the top of the stack, the semicolon (;) was used. The following GEORGE program reads in ten numbers and prints their squares: 1, 10 rep (i) read dup √ó punch ; ] In the above program, the \\"dup\\" command duplicated the top of the stack, so that there were then two copies of the value at the top of the stack. GIP (General Interpretive Programme) was a control program for manipulating programs called \\"bricks\\". Its principal service was in the running of programs from the several hundred in the DEUCE linear algebra library. Preparation of such a program involved selecting the required bricks (on punch cards), copying them and GIP in a reproducing punch, and assembling the copies into a deck of cards. Next, simple codewords would be written to use the bricks to perform such tasks as: matrix multiplication; matrix inversion; term-by-term matrix arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division); solving simultaneous equations; input; and output. The dimensions of matrices were never specified in the codewords. Dimensions were taken from the matrices themselves, either from a card preceding the data cards or from the matrices as stored on drum. Thus, programs were entirely general. Once written, such a program handled any size of matrices (up to the capacity of the drum, of course).Deuce Library Service, \\"DEUCE General Interpretive Programme\\", 2nd Ed., The English Electric Company Limited, Kidsgrove, Staffs, England, c. 1963. Programming Programming the DEUCE was different from other computers. The serial nature of the Delay Lines required that instructions be ordered such that when one instruction completed execution, the next one was ready to emerge from a Delay Line. For operations on the single registers, the earliest time that the next instruction could be obeyed was 64 microseconds after the present one. Thus, instructions were not executed from sequential locations. In general, instructions could transfer one or more words. Consequently, each instruction specified the location of the next instruction. Optimum programming meant that as each instruction was executed, the next one was just emerging from a Delay Line. The position of instructions in the store could greatly affect performance if the location of an instruction was not optimum. Reading data from the card reader was done in real-time - each row had to be read as it passed the read brushes, without stopping. Similarly for the card punch; the word for a particular row was prepared in advance and had to be ready when a given row of the card was in position under the punch knives. The normal mode of reading and punching was binary. Decimal input and output was performed via software. The high-speed store consisted of four single-word registers of 32 bits each, three double-word registers, and two quadruple-word registers. Each 32-bit word of the double and quadruple-word registers could be addressed separately. They could also be accessed as a pair, and‚Äîin the case of the quadruple registers‚Äîas a group of three or four. The instruction store consisted of twelve mercury delay lines, each of 32 words, and numbered 1 to 12. Delay Line 11 (DL11) served as the buffer between the magnetic drum and the high-speed store. Being a \\"transfer machine\\", data could be transferred a word at a time, a pair of words at a time, and any number of words up to 33 at a time. Thus, for example, 32 words read from the drum could be transferred as a block to any of the other delay lines; four words could be transferred as a block from one quadruple register to the other, or between a quadruple register and a delay line‚Äîall with one instruction. The 32 words of a delay line could be summed by passing them to the single-length adder (by means of a single instruction).\\" 'English Electric' D.E.U.C.E. Programming Manual\\", The English Electric Company Limited, May 1956, publication No. NS-y-16. By a special link between DL10 and one register, namely, register 16, DL10 could be used as a push-down stack. Production The first three machines were delivered in the northern spring of 1955; in late 1958 a DEUCE Mark II improved model appeared. This version employed a combined card reader and punch. The combined IBM 528 reader and punch behaved like the separate Hollerith units on the earlier DEUCE Mark I machines; however, it was provided with hardware conversion of alphanumeric data to BCD on input, and vice versa on output. Data could also be read in and punched simultaneously at 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE Mark IIA provided seven extra mercury delay lines, each of 32 words. A total of 33 DEUCE machines were sold between 1955 and 1964, two being purchased by the engine manufacturer Bristol Siddeley. The success of DEUCE was due to its program library of over 1000 programs and subroutines. Copeland, B.

(1990) Dictionary of Eye Terminology. Gainesville, Florida: Triad Publishing Company It is usually the result of impaired function of the extraocular muscles, where both eyes are still functional, but they cannot turn to target the desired object.O'Sullivan, S.B & Schmitz, T.J. (2007). Physical Rehabilitation. Philadelphia, PA: Davis. . Problems with these muscles may be due to mechanical problems, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, disorders of the cranial nerves (III, IV, and VI) that innervate the muscles, and occasionally disorders involving the supranuclear oculomotor pathways or ingestion of toxins.Blumenfeld, Hal (2010). Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases. Sunderland MA: Sinauer. . Diplopia can be one of the first signs of a systemic disease, particularly to a muscular or neurological process, and it may disrupt a person's balance, movement, or reading abilities. Causes Diplopia has a diverse range of ophthalmologic, infectious, autoimmune, neurological, and neoplastic causes: Diagnosis Diplopia is diagnosed mainly by information from the patient. Doctors may use blood tests, physical examinations, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find the underlying cause. =Classification= One of the first steps in diagnosing diplopia is often to see whether one of two major classifications may be eliminated; both may be present. That involves blocking one eye to see which symptoms are evident in each eye alone. Binocular Binocular diplopia is double vision arising as a result of strabismus (in layman's terms \\"cross-eyed\\"), the misalignment of the two eyes relative to each other, either esotropia (inward) or exotropia (outward). In such a case while the fovea of one eye is directed at the object of regard, the fovea of the other is directed elsewhere, and the image of the object of regard falls on an extrafoveal area of the retina. The brain calculates the visual direction of an object based upon the position of its image relative to the fovea. Images falling on the fovea are seen as being directly ahead, while those falling on retina outside the fovea may be seen as above, below, right, or left of straight ahead depending upon the area of retina stimulated. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, the brain perceives two images of one target object, as the target object simultaneously stimulates different, noncorresponding, retinal areas in either eye, thus producing double vision. This correlation of particular areas of the retina in one eye with the same areas in the other is known as retinal correspondence. This relationship also gives rise to an associated phenomenon of binocular diplopia, although one that is rarely noted by those experiencing diplopia. Because the fovea of one eye corresponds to the fovea of the other, images falling on the two foveae are projected to the same point in space. Thus, when the eyes are misaligned, two different objects will be perceived as superimposed in the same space. This phenomenon is known as visual confusion'. The brain naturally guards against double vision. In an attempt to avoid double vision, the brain can sometimes ignore the image from one eye, a process known as suppression. The ability to suppress is to be found particularly in childhood when the brain is still developing. Thus, those with childhood strabismus almost never complain of diplopia, while adults who develop strabismus almost always do. While this ability to suppress might seem an entirely positive adaptation to strabismus, in the developing child, this can prevent the proper development of vision in the affected eye, resulting in amblyopia. Some adults are also able to suppress their diplopia, but their suppression is rarely as deep or as effective and takes much longer to establish, thus they are not at risk of permanently compromising their vision. In some cases, diplopia disappears without medical intervention, but in other cases, the cause of the double vision may still be present. Certain persons with diplopia who cannot achieve fusion and yet do not suppress may display a certain type of spasm-like irregular movement of the eyes in the vicinity of the fixation point (see: Horror fusionis). Monocular Diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye; this is called monocular diplopia, or where the patient perceives more than two images, monocular polyopia. While serious causes rarely may be behind monocular diplopia symptoms, this is much less often the case than with binocular diplopia. The differential diagnosis of multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as corneal surface keratoconus, subluxation of the lens, a structural defect within the eye, a lesion in the anterior visual cortex, or nonorganic conditions, but diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom. Temporary Temporary binocular diplopia can be caused by alcohol intoxication or head injuries, such as concussion (if temporary double vision does not resolve quickly, one should see an optometrist or ophthalmologist immediately). It can also be a side effect of benzodiazepines or opioids, particularly if used in larger doses for recreation, the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and zonisamide, and the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine, as well as the hypnotic drug zolpidem and the dissociative drugs ketamine and dextromethorphan. Temporary diplopia can also be caused by tired or strained eye muscles. If diplopia appears with other symptoms such as fatigue and acute or chronic pain, the patient should see an ophthalmologist immediately. Voluntary Some people are able to consciously uncouple their eyes, either by overfocusing closely (i.e. going cross-eyed) or unfocusing. Also, while looking at one object behind another object, the foremost object's image is doubled (for example, placing one's finger in front of one's face while reading text on a computer monitor). In this sense, double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing stereograms possible.http://www.focusillusion.com/Instructions/ Instructions on how to view stereograms such as magic eye Monocular diplopia may be induced in many individuals, even those with normal eyesight, with simple defocusing experiments involving fine, high-contrast lines. Treatment The appropriate treatment for binocular diplopia depends upon the cause of the condition producing the symptoms. Efforts must first be made to identify and treat the underlying cause of the problem. Treatment options include eye exercises, wearing an eye patch on alternative eyes, prism correction, and in more extreme situations, surgery or botulinum toxin. If diplopia turns out to be intractable, it can be managed as last resort by obscuring part of the patient's field of view. This approach is outlined in the article on diplopia occurring in association with a condition called horror fusionis. It is possible to cure it with glasses.

Science Museum London. The Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) was a British early electronic serial stored- program computer designed by Alan Turing. It was based on the earlier Pilot ACE. It led to the MOSIAC computer, the Bendix G-15, and other computers. Background The project was managed by John R. Womersley, superintendent of the Mathematics Division of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The use of the word Engine was in homage to Charles Babbage and his Difference Engine and Analytical Engine. Turing's technical design Proposed Electronic Calculator was the product of his theoretical work in 1936 \\"On Computable Numbers\\" (and ) and his wartime experience at Bletchley Park where the Colossus computers had been successful in breaking German military codes. In his 1936 paper, Turing described his idea as a \\"universal computing machine\\", but it is now known as the Universal Turing machine. Turing was sought by Womersley to work in the NPL on the ACE project; he accepted and began work on 1 October 1945 and by the end of the year he completed his outline of his 'Proposed electronic calculator', which was the first reasonably complete design of a stored- program computer and, apart from being on a much larger scale than the final working machine, anticipated the final realisation in most important respects.Origins and development of the ACE project, B. J. Copeland, in Copeland (2005). However, because of the strict and long-lasting secrecy around the Bletchley Park work, he was prohibited (because of the Official Secrets Act) from explaining that he knew that his ideas could be implemented in an electronic device. The better-known EDVAC design presented in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC (dated 30 June 1945), by John von Neumann, who knew of Turing's theoretical work, received much publicity, despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas. Turing's report on the ACE was written in late 1945 and included detailed logical circuit diagrams and a cost estimate of ¬£11,200. He felt that speed and size of memory were crucial and he proposed a high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 kilobytes, accessed at a speed of 1 MHz; he remarked that for the purposes required \\"the memory needs to be very large indeed by comparison with standards which prevail in most valve and relay work, and [so] it is necessary to look for some more economical form of storage\\", and that memory \\"appears to be the main limitation in the design of a calculator, i.e. if the storage problem can be solved all the rest is comparatively straightforward\\".Proposed electronic calculator, Turing, 1945. Reprinted Copeland (2005). The ACE implemented subroutine calls, whereas the EDVAC did not, and what also set the ACE apart from the EDVAC was the use of Abbreviated Computer Instructions, an early form of programming language. Initially, it was planned that Tommy Flowers, the engineer at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in north London, who had been responsible for building the Colossus computers should build the ACE, but because of the secrecy around his wartime achievements and the pressure of post-war work, this was not possible.  Pilot ACE  Turing's colleagues at the NPL, not knowing about Colossus, thought that the engineering work to build a complete ACE was too ambitious, so the first version of the ACE that was built was the Pilot Model ACE, a smaller version of Turing's original design. Turing's assistant, Jim Wilkinson, worked on the logical design of the ACE and after Turing left for Cambridge in 1947, Wilkinson was appointed to lead the ACE group. The Pilot ACE had fewer than 1000 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) compared to about 18,000 in the ENIAC.The ACE test assembly, H.D. Huskey, in Copeland (2005). It used mercury delay lines for its main memory. Each of the 12 delay lines was 5 feet (1.5 m) long and propagated 32 instructions or data words of 32 bits each. This ran its first program on 10 May 1950, at which time it was the fastest computer in the world; each of its delay lines had a throughput of 1 Mbit/s.Programming the Pilot ACE, J.G. Hayes. In Copeland (2005). The first production versions of the Pilot ACE, the English Electric DEUCE, of which 31 were sold, were delivered in 1955.  MOSAIC  A second implementation of the ACE design was the MOSAIC (Ministry of Supply Automatic Integrator and Computer). This was built by Allen Coombs and William Chandler of Dollis Hill who had worked with Tommy Flowers on building the ten Colossus computers. It was installed at the Radar Research and Development Establishment (RRDE) at Malvern, which later merged with the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to become the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE). It ran its first trial program in late 1952 or early 1953 and became operational in early 1955. MOSAIC contained 6,480 electronic valves and had an availability of about 75%. It occupied four rooms and was the largest of the early British computers. It was used to calculate aircraft trajectories from radar data. It continued operating until the early 1960s.\\"Catalogue: The MOSAIC Computer\\" Derivatives The principles of the ACE design were used in the Bendix Corporation's G-15 computer. The engineering design was done by Harry Huskey who had spent 1947 in the ACE section at the NPL. He later contributed to the hardware designs for the EDVAC. The first G-15 ran in 1954 and, as a relatively small single-user machine, some consider it to be the first personal computer. Other derivatives of the ACE include the EMI Electronic Business Machine and the Packard Bell Corporation PB 250.  Footnotes  Bibliography      External links  * Oral history interview with Donald W.

Det svenska rikets uppkomst. Stockholm, 1925. p. 79.) is a legendary character who appears in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf and scholars have pointed out that he also appears to be present in the Norse K√°lfsv√≠sa.Beowulf and some fictions of the Geatish succession by Frederick M. Biggs. In both Beowulf and K√°lfsv√≠sa, Weohstan (V√©steinn) fought for his king Onela (√Åli) against Eadgils (A√∞ils). Beowulf According to Beowulf, Weohstan is the father of Wiglaf, and he belongs to a clan called the W√¶gmundings. Ecg√æeow, the father of Beowulf, also belonged to this clan, so Weohstan is in some degree related to Beowulf. Thus he counts Weohstan's son Wiglaf as his kinsman. Weohstan is referred to as having died of old age before the action of the later part of the poem. Weohstan is first mentioned in Beowulf at line 2602. We learn that he had held an estate and rights in common land in Geatland, which Beowulf gave to him.Lines 2606-8. When the Scylfing prince Eanmund rebelled against his uncle, Onela, the king of Sweden, Weohstan fought in the service of Onela and killed Eanmund in battle; for this Onela gave Weohstan Eanmund's sword and armor.Lines 2610-19. In his old age, Weohstan gave this sword and armor to his son Wiglaf.Lines 2623-25. By that time both Weohstan and Wiglaf \\"lived among the Geats\\".Line 2623. His name appears in several places where Wiglaf is described as \\"the son of Weohstan\\".Lines 2752, 2602, 2862, 2907, 3076, 3110, 3120.) The scholar Frederick Klaeber speculates that though Onela himself did not seek a feud with Weohstan, once Onela was dead and Eanmund's brother Eadgils became king of the Swedes, Weohstan found it prudent to leave the service of the Scylfings, and this is how he came to be living among the Geats.Klaeber, Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, Third Edition, D.C.

However, the skald of the K√°lfsv√≠sa expected the listener to be familiar with these characters and mentions no more of what happened. However, as is told in passing in Beowulf and more in detail by Snorri, Eadgils won the battle.

He persuaded the World Bank's senior management, in the immediate aftermath of the Chinese authorities' repression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, that the Bank should stay actively engaged with China‚Äîa stance challenged at the time by many of the Bank's most powerful shareholder countries. He served as the Regional Vice-President for Latin America and the Caribbean during 1994‚Äì1999. He took a leave of absence from the World Bank to serve in a caretaker role as Pakistan's de facto Finance Minister for 67 days in 1996‚Äì1997 (exercising the responsibilities of the Finance Minister without assuming the title). He retired from the World Bank in 1999.  Publications  Burki is the author or editor of several books on Pakistan, including: Pakistan Under Bhutto (1980, Macmillan); Pakistan under the Military: Eleven Years of Zia Ul-Haq (with Craig Baxter, 1991, Westview Press); Pakistan: Fifty Years of Nationhood (1999, Westview Press); A Historical Dictionary of Pakistan (1999, Scarecrow Press); and Changing Perceptions, Altered Reality: Pakistan's Economy under Musharraf, 1999‚Äì2006 (2007, Oxford University Press, Karachi). Other publications on development include: A Study of Chinese Communes (1969, Harvard University Press); First Things First (with Paul Streeten, 1981, Oxford University Press); and Transforming Socialist Economies: Lessons from Cuba and Beyond (edited, with Daniel P. Erikson, 2005, Palgrave Macmillan).See Burki's short biography and list of publications at the website of the Peterson Institute for International Economics:  Other activities  Burki writes an opinion piece for a Pakistani newspaper (Dawn) once a week.

It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning . It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management (KM) . History and background Although as early as 1998 Davenport wrote on the importance to worker productivity of understanding individual knowledge processes (cited in ), the term personal knowledge management appears to be relatively new. Its origin can be traced in a working paper by . PKM integrates personal information management (PIM), focused on individual skills, with knowledge management (KM) in addition to input from a variety of disciplines such as cognitive psychology, management and philosophy . From an organizational perspective, understanding of the field has developed in light of expanding knowledge about human cognitive capabilities and the permeability of organizational boundaries. From a metacognitive perspective, it compares various modalities within human cognition as to their competence and efficacy . It is an underresearched area . More recently, research has been conducted to help understand \\"the potential role of Web 2.0 technologies for harnessing and managing personal knowledge\\" . Models identified information retrieval, assessment and evaluation, organization, analysis, presentation, security, and collaboration as essential to PKM (cited in ). Wright's model involves four interrelated domains: analytical, information, social and learning. The analytical domain involves competencies such as interpretation, envisioning, application, creation and contextualization. The information dimension comprises the sourcing, assessment, organization, aggregation, and communication of information. The social dimension involves finding and collaborating with people, development of both close networks and extended networks, and dialogue. The learning dimension entails expanding pattern recognition and sensemaking capabilities, reflection, development of new knowledge, improvement of skills, and extension to others. This model stresses the importance of both bonding and bridging networks . In Nonaka and Takeuchi's SECI model of knowledge dimensions (see under knowledge management), knowledge can be tacit or explicit, with the interaction of the two resulting in new knowledge . Smedley has developed a PKM model based on Nonaka and colleagues' model in which an expert provides direction and a community of practice provides support for personal knowledge creation . Trust is central to knowledge sharing in this model. Nonaka has recently returned to his earlier work in an attempt to further develop his ideas about knowledge creation Personal knowledge management can also be viewed along two main dimensions, personal knowledge and personal management . Zhang has developed a model of PKM in relation to organizational knowledge management (OKM) that considers two axes of knowledge properties and management perspectives, either organizational or personal. These aspects of organizational and personal knowledge are interconnected through the OAPI process (organizationalize, aggregate, personalize, and individualize), whereby organizational knowledge is personalized and individualized and personal knowledge is aggregated and operationalized as organizational knowledge . Criticism It is not clear whether PKM is anything more than a new wrapper around personal information management (PIM). William Jones argued that only personal information as tangible resource can be managed, whereas personal knowledge cannot . Dave Snowden has asserted that most individuals cannot manage their knowledge in the traditional sense of \\"managing\\" and has advocated thinking in terms of sensemaking rather than PKM . Knowledge is not solely an individual product‚Äîit emerges through connections, dialog and social interaction (see Sociology of knowledge). However, in Wright's model, PKM involves the application to problem solving of analytical, information, social, and learning dimensions, which are interrelated , and so is inherently social. An aim of PKM is \\"helping individuals to be more effective in personal, organisational and social environments\\" , often through the use of technology such as networking software. It has been argued, however, that equation of PKM with technology has limited the value and utility of the concept (e.g. , ). In 2012, Mohamed Chatti introduced the personal knowledge network (PKN) model to KM as an alternative perspective on PKM, based on the concepts of personal knowledge network and knowledge ecology . Skills Skills associated with personal knowledge management include: * Reflection. Continuous improvement on how the individual operates. * Manage learning. Manage how and when the individual learns. * Information literacy. Understanding what information is important and how to find unknown information. * Organizational skills. Personal librarianship. Personal categorization and taxonomies. * Networking with others. Knowing what your network of people knows. Knowing who might have additional knowledge and resources to help you * Researching, canvassing, paying attention, interviewing and observational \\"cultural anthropology\\" skills * Communication skills. Perception, intuition, expression, visualization and interpretation. * Creative skills. Imagination, pattern recognition, appreciation, innovation, inference. Understanding of complex adaptive systems. * Collaboration skills. Coordination, synchronization, experimentation, cooperation and design. Tools Some organizations are introducing PKM \\"systems\\" with some or all of four components: * Just-in-time canvassing: templates and e-mail canvassing lists that enable people to identify and connect with the appropriate experts and expertise quickly and effectively * Knowledge harvesting: software tools that automatically collect appropriate knowledge residing on subject matter experts' hard drives * Content management: taxonomy processes and desktop search tools that enable employees to subscribe to, find, organize and publish information that resides on their desktops * Personal productivity improvement: knowledge fairs and 101 training sessions to help each employee make more effective personal use of the knowledge, learning and technology resources available in the context of their work PKM has also been linked to these tools: * Social bookmarking and enterprise bookmarking * Knowledge logs (k-logs) * Email, calendars, task managers * Virtual assistants * Personal and semantic wikis Other useful tools include Open Space Technology, cultural anthropology, stories and narrative, mindmaps, concept maps and eco-language, and single frames and similar information visualization techniques. Individuals use these tools to capture ideas, expertise, experience, opinions or thoughts, and this \\"voicing\\" will encourage cognitive diversity and promote free exchanges away from a centralized policed knowledge repository. The goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and personal content management.

There is evidence that yoga nidra helps relieve stress. An ancient technique from India, it has now spread worldwide and is also being applied by the US Army to assist soldiers to recover from post-traumatic stress disorder. State of consciousness Yoga nidra is a state in which the body is completely relaxed, and the practitioner becomes systematically and increasingly aware of the inner world by following a set of verbal instructions. This state of consciousness is different from meditation, in which concentration on a single focus is required. In yoga nidra the practitioner remains in a state of light withdrawal of the 5 senses (pratyahara) with four senses internalised, that is, withdrawn, and only hearing still connects to any instructions given. The goals of both yogic paths, yoga nidra and meditation are the same, a state of meditative consciousness called samadhi. It is among the deepest possible states of relaxation while still maintaining full consciousness. In lucid dreaming, one is only, or mainly, cognizant of the dream environment, and has little or no awareness of one's actual environment. Yoga nidra results in conscious awareness of the deep sleep state, which is called prajna in the Mandukya Upanishad. History Vishnu asleep on the eternal waters. 19th century It is said that the history of yoga nidra is as old as yoga itself, as the first mention of yoga nidra is in the Upanishads. Lord Krishna is associated with yoga nidra in the epic Mahabharata: Modern usage In modern times, Satyananda Saraswati claimed to have experienced yoga nidra when he was living with his guru Sivananda Saraswati in Rishikesh. He began studying the tantric scriptures and, after practice, constructed a system of relaxation which he popularized in the mid-20th century. He explained yoga nidra as a state of mind between wakefulness and sleep that opened deep phases of the mind, suggesting a connection with the ancient tantric practice called nyasa, whereby Sanskrit mantras are mentally placed within specific body parts, while meditating on each part (of the bodymind). The form of practice taught by Satyananda includes eight stages (internalisation, sankalpa, rotation of consciousness, breath awareness, manifestation of opposites, creative visualization, sankalpa and externalisation). Satyananda used this technique, along with suggestion, on the child who was to become his successor, Niranjanananda Saraswati, from the age of four. He claims to have taught him several languages by this method. The Mindful Yoga teacher Anne Cushman states that \\"This body-sensing journey [that I teach in Mindful Yoga] ... is one variation of the ancient practice of Yoga nidra ... and of the body-scan technique commonly used in the Buddhist Vipassana tradition.\\" The western pioneer of yoga as therapy, Richard Miller, has developed the use of Yoga nidra for rehabilitating soldiers in pain, using the Integrative Restoration (iRest) methodology. Miller worked with Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the United States Department of Defense studying the efficacy of the approach. * Walter Reed * Dr Richard Miller: Not Recommending Yoga Would Be Malpractice * Soldier's Meditation IREST * The Yoga of Being on Retreat with Richard Miller According to Yoga Journal, \\"Miller is responsible for bringing the practice to a remarkable variety of nontraditional settings\\" which includes \\"military bases and in veterans' clinics, homeless shelters, Montessori schools, Head Start programs, hospitals, hospices, chemical dependency centers, and jails.\\" The iRest protocol was used with soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/yoga.aspx Based on this work, the Surgeon General of the United States Army endorsed Yoga Nidra as a complementary alternative medicine (CAM) for chronic pain in 2010. Scientific evidence At well-equipped laboratories Swami Rama demonstrated conscious entry into NREM delta wave sleep through yoga nidra, whereas his disciple was able to demonstrate delta and theta waves even with eyes open and talking. Yoga nidra meditation is associated with increased endogenous dopamine release in the ventral striatum of the brain. The reduced desire for action in the state is associated with the reduced flow of blood in parts of the brain connected with controlling actions, the prefrontal cortex, the cerebellum and the subcortex. Yoga nidra improves heart rate variability, a measure of balance in the autonomic nervous system, whether or not it is preceded by a session of hatha yoga asanas. The regular practice of yoga relaxation has been found to reduce tension and anxiety. The autonomic symptoms of high anxiety such as headache, giddiness, chest pain, palpitations, sweating and abdominal pain respond well. It has been used to help soldiers from war cope with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Rivers, Eileen. A Breath of Hope.

It was substantially larger than the original Chariot manned torpedo. Known individually as X-Craft, the vessels were designed to be towed to their intended area of operations by a full-size \\"mother\\" submarine ‚Äì usually one of the T class or S class ‚Äì with a passage crew on board, the operational crew being transferred from the towing submarine to the X-Craft by dinghy when the operational area was reached, and the passage crew returning with the dinghy to the towing submarine. Once the attack was over, the X-Craft would rendezvous with the towing submarine and then be towed home. Range was limited primarily by the endurance and determination of their crews, but was thought to be up to 14 days in the craft or 1,200 miles (1931 km) distance after suitable training. Actual range of the X-Craft itself was surfaced and at submerged.https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/how-the-royal-navys-x-class- midget-subs-helped-make-d-d-1709530716 Specification The craft was about long, maximum diameter and displaced surfaced and submerged. Propulsion was by a 4-cylinder Gardner 4LKhttp://www.gardnerengineforum.co.uk/Web%20PDF%20Versions/Newsletter%2011.pdf 42 hp diesel engine, converted from a type used in London buses and a 30 hp electric motor, giving a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of about one third of that. The crew initially numbered three‚Äîcommander, pilot and ERA (Engine Room Artificer, i.e. engineer), but soon a specialist diver was added, for whom an airlock, known as a \\"wet and dry\\" compartment, was provided. The ERA, usually a Navy Chief Petty Officer, operated and maintained the machinery in the vessel. The weapons on the \\"X-Craft\\" were two side- cargoes ‚Äì explosive charges held on opposite sides of the hull with two tons of amatol in each. The intention was to drop these on the sea bed underneath the target and then escape. The charges were detonated by a time fuse. The craft were fitted with electromagnets to evade detection by anti-submarine detectors on the sea bed and also with sonar and a periscope. Service A number of development craft were built before it was felt that a feasible weapon had been produced. The first operational craft was X3 (or HM S/M X.3), launched on the night of 15 March 1942. Training with the craft began in September 1942, with X4 arriving in October. In December 1942 and January 1943, six of the \\"5-10\\" class began to arrive, identical externally but with a completely reworked interior. These operations were part of a longer series of frogman operations; see human torpedo. The operational base and training establishment was at the former Kyles Hydro Hotel at Port Bannatyne on the Isle of Bute in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland. =Major operations= X25 underway Their first deployment was Operation Source in September, 1943, an attempt to neutralise the heavy German warships based at K√•fjord, Nordkapp in Northern Norway. Six X-Craft were used but only two successfully laid charges (under the German battleship Tirpitz). Two had become disconnected while being towed to Norway, one suffered mechanical failure and was scuttled, and another sank after being attacked. Only X6 and X7, commanded by Lieutenant Donald Cameron and Lieutenant Godfrey Place, respectively, were successful. Tirpitz was badly damaged, crippled, and out of action until May 1944; it was destroyed on 12 November 1944 by Avro Lancaster bombers during Operation Catechism in Troms√∏, Norway. For this action, Cameron and Place were awarded the Victoria Cross, whilst Robert Aitken, Richard Haddon Kendall, and John Thornton Lorimer received the Distinguished Service Order and Edmund Goddard the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal. The commander of X8, John Elliott Smart, was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). There was a possibility that X5 had also successfully planted explosive side charges before being destroyed, but this was never conclusively proven; its commander Henty-Creer was not awarded a medal, but was mentioned in dispatches. The lost boats were replaced early in 1944 with X20 to X25 and six training-only craft. Submarines X20 to X25 were dispatched to Bergen, Norway. On 15 April 1944, in Operation Guidance X24 attacked the Laksev√•g floating dock. X22 was intended for the mission, but had been accidentally rammed during training and sunk with all hands. X24 made the approach and escaped successfully, but the charges were placed under B√§renfels, a merchant vessel alongside the dock; the ship was sunk but the dock suffered only minor damage. On 11 September, the operation was repeated by X24; this time she succeeded in sinking the dock. hydraulically powered, net cutter of the type used by X boat divers to cut through torpedo nets protecting harbours X-Craft were involved in the preparatory work for Overlord. Operation Postage Able was planned to take surveys of the landing beaches with X20, commanded by Lt KR Hudspeth, spending four days off the French coast. Periscope reconnaissance of the shoreline and echo-soundings were performed during daytime. Each night, X20 would approach the beach and 2 divers would swim ashore. Soil samples were collected in condoms. The divers went ashore on two nights to survey the beaches at Vierville-sur-Mer, Moulins St Laurent and Colleville-sur-Mer in what became the American Omaha Beach. On the third night, they were due to go ashore off the Orne Estuary (Sword Beach), but by this stage fatigue (the crew and divers had been living on little more than benzedrine tablets) and the worsening weather caused Hudspeth to shorten the operation, returning to Dolphin on 21 January 1944. Hudspeth received a bar to his DSC. X20 and X23, each with a crew of five, acted as navigational beacons to help the D-Day invasion fleet land on the correct beaches (Operation Gambit), as part of the Combined Operations Pilotage Parties (COPP). The craft were also equipped with a radio beacon and echo sounder to help direct Canadian and British ships to the suitable positions on Sword and Juno beaches. Oxygen bottles on both craft enabled the crews to remain submerged for extended periods during this operation, 64 hours of the 76 total hours at sea. =Legacy= The only remaining intact example of an X-Craft, X24 was transferred from HMS Dolphin, where she had been on display since 1981, to the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in 1987.

In the media This type of midget submarine was portrayed in the 1955 war film, Above Us the Waves, featuring John Mills, which was based on both Operation Source and the earlier Chariot attacks on the Tirpitz. An X-class submarine - marked as \\"X2\\" - features in the 1959 film The Giant Behemoth (a.k.a. Behemoth the Sea Monster). This class of submarine was later featured in the 1968 movie Submarine X-1 starring James Caan as a Canadian Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer who after losing his submarine and fifty crew members in a battle with a German ship during World War II, gets a second chance training crews to take part in a raid using midget subs. A 2006 Alexander Fullerton novel, The Gatecrashers, features a fictionalized account of X-class midget submarines, including X-12 piloted by one of the protagonists, that lays explosive charges to damage the Tirpitz.

A miner and later Member of Parliament in County Durham, he served in the governments of Ramsay MacDonald and Clement Attlee. In 1950 he was ennobled as Baron Lawson, of Beamish in the County of Durham, and is sometimes referred to as Lord Lawson of Beamish. Background Lawson was born in the port town of Whitehaven, Cumberland, and grew up in the nearby village of Kells. His father John Lawson was a sailor and miner who had begun working in a colliery by the age of nine, sailed round the world by eleven, and later served in the Royal Naval Reserve. His mother, Lisbeth Savage, was a strict disciplinarian. Both parents were illiterate and the family lived in extremes of poverty common at the time. At the age of three, Lawson was sent to the local National School, Glass House School. Here, he learned to read, developing an avid interest in popular fiction as a boy, and moving on to literary fiction and poetry in later years. When he was six his family moved to the village of Flimby, near the towns of Maryport and Workington. The family now included ten children: five boys and five girls. Two of his elder brothers worked with his father at the local colliery and the family was no longer on the breadline. A year later, they moved to County Durham, where the working members were employed at Boldon Colliery. The family joined the Co-operative Society, and were committed trade unionists, active in the Durham miners' strike of 1892. Outside of school, Jack Lawson's time was consumed with chores and he often looked after his youngest brother, Will, born in 1890. Lawson eagerly began work in the colliery the day after he turned twelve. He started as a trapper, opening and shutting doors for the drivers, working a ten-hour day. He was paid ten pence per day, and his life greatly improved ‚Äì he was treated as an adult now. After a few months he became a driver, with his own pony. After a couple more years, he began off- hand work, braking inclines and attending to the signalling bells. He began attending union meetings, including the annual Durham Miners' Gala, where in later years he met the likes of Will Crooks, Ellen Wilkinson, Ernest Bevin and George Lansbury. At eighteen he became a putter and began speaking and working for the union. With five members of the family now working at the colliery, the Lawsons had a higher status and moved into a house closer to the pit, with a front room. Throughout this period he gambled frequently and read a lot: Eventually, reading won over gambling. He had read nothing of economics or politics yet, but had developed a strong sense of injustice, firmly believing that manual workers were under-paid and under-valued. These ideas generally seemed strange to his colleagues and family and he kept them to himself. He joined the Methodist Society, and found his ideas more accepted there. Through reading the Labour Leader and The Clarion, Lawson realised he was a socialist. At the age of 21 he met Isabella Graham Scott, a domestic servant from Sunderland who was staying with friends at Boldon. They were married in February 1906. Trade Unionist In 1904, Lawson joined the newly founded branch of the Independent Labour Party at Boldon. He was invited to be a speaker, but initially refused, unsure of his own ability. He discovered a socialist bookshop in Newcastle, where he met many like-minded people, and read books on economics and society, including those of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin. He became a hewer that year, working at the coal-face, and within a few months was elected as an assistant checkweighman. He had no ambition for work beyond being a hewer, but he did want to continue his education. He began teaching boys who worked at the colliery and then helped to set up a school for adults in two disused colliery houses. In 1905 Lawson became an active speaker for the ILP, expounding socialism and the Labour Representation Committee to the miners of Durham, who had traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Later that year, Lawson joined a correspondence class with Ruskin College, Oxford. The following spring, Lawson received a letter from the college offering him six months' scholarship if he could find the money to pay for the other six months. This was a significant expense that would be compounded by living costs, and as Lawson was determined that he would only ever work as a miner there was no obvious advantage to university study. Canon William Moore Ede, a county councillor and later Dean of Worcester, convinced him to go and helped raise some of the fees; Lawson and his wife sold their furniture and saved what they could, and the rest was paid by his parents. His wife moved to Oxford with him, finding work and accommodation as a servant in a series of homes. Amongst his tutors, Hastings Lees-Smith, the vice-principal of Ruskin and a lecturer on economics, had a particular influence on Lawson. At the end of the year, Lawson was offered a further six months scholarship on the same terms, and after working at Boldon over the winter to raise the money he began his second year of study in February 1908. Halfway through that year, he was told that the College Council had decided to extend his scholarship to cover the rest of the full year. It was suggested he should enter Manchester College, Oxford, to study for a degree. He was grateful but refused, not wanting a professional career; three months later, he returned to Boldon. He became well known around the county, as a speaker for both the ILP and the union. He was a negotiator for his union lodge and a delegate to the Miner's Council at Durham. In 1909, he was invited by the union to run for Durham County Council, but he was not yet on the electoral register and was ineligible to stand. Pete Curran, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Jarrow, had made Lawson his election agent: this was unpaid, hard work, and consumed all of Lawson's spare time during campaigns, as he travelled to and around Jarrow division. Curran was hit by ill health in the January 1910 general election and had trouble campaigning. He lost by less than 100 votes and died within a week. The Lawson's first daughter, Irene, was born later that year. Whilst campaigning in the general election in December, Lawson was asked by friends in Chester-le-Street to stand for the position of checkweighman at Alma Colliery. Elected and paid by hewers, as a checkweighman he would be responsible for ensuring miners received the full amount due for the coal they dug and would act as their legal representative. Lawson was reluctant to leave manual work, but allowed his name to go forward. Labour lost Jarrow again; at the same time, the miners at Alma, elected him almost unanimously. Member of Parliament Two years after moving there, Lawson was elected to the County Council for the Chester-le-Street division. He wrote a pamphlet campaigning for minimum wage for miners and was a leading figure in Durham during the miners' strike of 1912 on this issue. He and his wife had a second daughter, Edna, while his brother Will, whom he had tutored, took a diploma in Economics and Political Science at Ruskin. In 1913 he was a delegate to the Miner's International in Carlsbad. Journeying through Leipzig and Dresden, he saw the growing Prussian army, and once in the Balkans witnessed some of the troubles that would spark the first World War. When war broke out in 1914, Will Lawson became an officer in the Durham Light Infantry. Jack Lawson followed his example, volunteering for service; experienced with horses, he was assigned as a driver with the Royal Field Artillery, serving in France. Another brother, Tom, joined the Border Regiment. Will Lawson was sent to Ypres in January 1915, and died in battle thirteen months later. Following the end of the war, Jack Lawson was granted temporary leave to contest the Seaham division of Durham in the 1918 general election; he campaigned against war reparations and won only a third of the votes against a coalition candidate. After that he was sent to Clipstone in Derbyshire, where he was demobbed. Returning to work at Alma Colliery and as a county councillor, he started to have health problems and was sick during the council elections the following year. The Labour Party, which entered the election with around a dozen out of one hundred councillors, won control of the council. Later in 1919, John Taylor, Labour MP for Chester-le-Street since 1906 and a friend of Lawson's, resigned his seat due to ill health. Though reluctant to risk leaving Durham and the colliery for London and Parliament, Lawson was persuaded to stand for Labour in the by- election. He was sponsored by the Durham Miner's Association and won with a majority of eleven thousand, entering the House of Commons in November 1919. Ramsay MacDonald appointed Lawson as Financial Secretary to the War Office in the 1924 Labour government. He worked alongside Clement Attlee, and the two came to enjoy a very firm friendship and mutual admiration. Both felt odd, controlling generals they'd served under a few years before, but the generals liked them, considering them less idle than their predecessors. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour in the 1929 Labour government, but refused MacDonald's invitation to join the National Government following the split in 1931. The 1931 general election was disastrous for Labour, and Lawson was one of only two Durham Labour MPs to keep their seats, out of seventeen who won there in the 1929 election. During the 1930s, Lawson supplemented his income as an MP by writing. He published his autobiography, A Man's Life, in 1932, intended as a record of the family life of miners. He followed this with a novel about miners, Under the Wheels, and biographies of Peter Lee and Herbert Smith. He also wrote for newspapers and periodicals. Elder Statesman When Attlee became leader of the Labour Party in 1935, he created a new Defence Committee for the party, appointing Lawson along with A. V. Alexander and Manny Shinwell. In April 1936, Lawson wrote a column in the Sunday Sun criticising the National Government's policy of appeasement: Entitled \\"Watch Winston\\", it predicted the government's policy of appeasement would result in war, and that Winston Churchill, at that time a marginal figure, would return to become Prime Minister. In April 1939, during the build-up to the Second World War, Sir John Anderson, the Home Secretary, appointed Lawson as Deputy Commissioner for Civil Defence in the Northern Region. This region covered Durham, Northumberland and the North Riding; Lawson oversaw preparations for aerial bombardment and possible invasion, and the organisation of shelter and relief when bombing began. Lawson later refused the offer of a position in government to continue his work in civil defence. His third daughter, Alma, was a gunner in the ATS; his son Clive, born in 1932, was killed by a bomb in 1942.Civilian War Dead, 1939-45, https://www.cwgc.org/ With Labour's victory in the general election of July 1945, Lawson was appointed Secretary of State for War, with a seat in Attlee's Cabinet. During the closing months of the war, he travelled thousands of miles, visiting troops in India and the Far East, and speaking at military functions and mass meetings. His refusal to stick to the scheduled, whitewashed routes on official visits, insistence on seeing everything for himself, and willingness to stop and listen to everyone he met, made him unpopular with senior officers. However, he was very popular with soldiers, who were glad that one of their own was now in the War Office. Lawson oversaw planning for post-war operations, including the occupation of Germany, and for the mass demobilisation, ensuring it happened quickly and smoothly. He also served as one of Attlee's key allies in the Cabinet, particularly during early conflicts with Herbert Morrison. However, from the summer of 1946, Lawson found his job increasingly difficult: he suffered severe health problems and had to go into hospital, retiring from the front bench in October. In 1949, on Attlee's recommendation, the King appointed Jack Lawson as Lord Lieutenant of Durham. He resigned from parliament in December 1949 on appointment as vice- chairman of the National Parks Commission, he was made a hereditary peer as Baron Lawson, of Beamish in the County of Durham, in March 1950.The extract from The London Gazette, TUESDAY, 21 MARCH, 1950: Lords Lieutenant are unpaid, and Lawson, one of the first working-class men to hold such a position, received income support. He attended the House of Lords but did not take a front-bench position. Still a close friend of Attlee, he provided moral support during struggle to hold the Labour Party together during the 1950s. His prot√©g√©, Sam Watson, became General Secretary of the Durham Miners and one of the most influential trade unionists in the party. Lawson's grave in St Paul's Churchyard, West Pelton Lawson retired as Lord Lieutenant in 1958 and died in 1965, at the age of83. His hereditary peerage became extinct on his death. The Lord Lawson of Beamish Community School is named in his honour. He was for years on friendly terms with the historian Sir Arthur Bryant, despite the latter's more right-wing outlook.

It was an anti-tank arm-of-service that operated anti-tank artillery, and made exclusive use of the tank destroyers, which were also named Panzerj√§ger. Personnel wore ordinary field-gray uniforms rather than the black of the Panzer troops; however, those Panzerj√§ger troops who crewed the tank- destroyers wore the Panzer jacket in field gray. Development From 1940, the Panzerj√§ger troops were equipped with vehicles produced by mounting an existing anti-tank gun complete with the gun shield on a tracked chassis to allow higher mobility. The development of Panzerj√§gers into the fully protected Jagdpanzer armored vehicle designs began before the war with the Sturmgesch√ºtz-designated armored artillery vehicles, the initial German turretless tanks to use completely closed-in armored casemates, and continued until 1944, resulting in the fully enclosed Jagdpanzer \\"hunting tanks\\", purpose-built heavy-gun tank destroyers. These usually used upward extensions of both the glacis plate and hull sides to comprise three sides of their closed-in casemates. Panzerj√§ger continued to serve as a separate branch of the Heer until the end of the war, often replacing tanks due to production shortages. Initially, the chassis of captured light tanks were used after turrets were removed, providing a cost-effective solution to the German shortage of mobile anti-tank weapons in infantry divisions. Despite the shortcomings of light armour and high silhouette, they were successfully used in their intended role, which was basically a self-propelled anti-tank gun. Neither anti-tank guns nor Panzerj√§gers had any real armor to speak of, and while the Panzerj√§ger had a higher silhouette and was more visible than an anti-tank gun, it was also much more mobile, and was able to relocate or retreat far more rapidly than conventional anti-tank gun crews. The lack of armor meant little until the self-propelled guns began to take on more and more of the offensive duties of tanks as the war progressed and production lagged. Organisation From 1943, the Type 44 infantry divisions included the following divisional Panzerj√§ger-Abteilung: * Staff company (Stabskompanie) * 1. Panzerj√§ger-Kompanie equipped with 9 - 12 towed AT guns * 2. StuG-Batterie equipped with ten fully-casemated StuG III, IV or Hetzer vehicles * 3. Light anti-aircraft company (leichte FlaK-Kompanie) equipped with 12 towed 20 mm FlaK autocannons Combat use Panzerj√§ger units were either assigned as the 14th companies in infantry regiments, or as a whole Abteilung (battalion) within Panzer and Panzergrenadier divisions, in both the SS and the Heer (regular army). Independent battalions and regiments were used by corps to protect the most likely avenues of tank attacks, while divisions would often position their Panzerj√§ger on the flanks, or use them to support infantry advances against an enemy using tanks. When used with tanks, despite intense inter-branch rivalry, Panzerj√§ger would work in teams, with the tank crews enticing enemy tanks to fire, disclosing their position, and Panzerj√§ger engaging the enemy from a defilade. Panzerj√§ger were often called upon to provide direct high explosive supporting fire to infantry by destroying machinegun and artillery positions, particularly in urban fighting. Vehicle designs Designs of the Panzerj√§ger vehicles varied based on the chassis used, which could be of three types: * Early war open-topped superstructure on a light tank chassis * Mid-war fully enclosed crew compartment on a medium or heavy tank chassis, as an added-on entity not usually integral to the original hull armor * Late war unarmoured or shielded mounting on a half-track chassis Notable tank destroyers in the Panzerj√§ger classification were: *Panzerj√§ger I ‚Äì 47 mm PaK on Panzer I chassis. *Marder I ‚Äì 75 mm PaK on captured French chassis, the Lorraine 37L. *Marder II ‚Äì 75 mm PaK or reused Soviet 76.2 mm gun on Panzer II chassis. *Marder III ‚Äì 75 mm PaK or reused Soviet 76.2 mm gun on Czech-built Panzer 38(t) chassis. *Dicker Max ‚Äì 2 prototypes produced, one lost due to accidental fire, the other destroyed in combat. *Sturer Emil ‚Äì 1 out of 2 survives. *Hornisse/Nashorn ‚Äì 88 mm PaK on composite Panzer III/Panzer IV chassis. *Elefant ‚Äì the last Panzerj√§ger vehicle so designated, incorporating a fully enclosed, added-on casemate. The later Jagdpanzer designation was used from the beginning for the following more integrally armored vehicles: *Jagdpanzer 38(t) *Jagdpanther *Jagdpanzer IV *Jagdtiger See also *Deacon - a British mobile anti-tank gun. *M56 Scorpion - a US self-propelled gun *Panzerj√§ger Brechen Durch! (Tanks Break Through!) by Alfred-Ingemar Berndt, an eye-witness account of the battles that led to the fall of France. When the 1940 attack was in the offing, Berndt joined the Wehrmacht, was sergeant in an anti-tank division, and afterward published his recollections.

Also bitmap textures can be created to be used as repetitive patterns to fill an infinite area. The borders of these patterns or small textures should be treated to give a seamless appearance when applied to an image, unless, of course, the seam is something to be shown. When designed for print, textures should be created in high-resolution in order to achieve good results in the final print. On the other side, if these textures are meant to be used in multimedia, 3d animation or web design, they should be created in a maximum resolution that equals the one of the final display (TV, computer monitor, movie projector, etc.). If creating a texture with a computer is not an option, then textures can be obtained by purchasing stock images collections, which are expensive but often of a professional quality.

He produced tracks for Funkdoobiest, House of Pain, Dizzee Rascal, U2, Depeche Mode, Die Antwoord and more. He is a current member of hip hop group Cypress Hill, a member of the trip hop band Cross My Heart Hope To Die, and the leader of Los Angeles art collective Soul Assassins. Life and career Muggs was born in Queens, New York City, and was adopted into a Norwegian family. He moved to Los Angeles at age fourteen, and got his start DJing for hip hop group The 7A3, who put out one album in 1988 before disbanding. He has one daughter, named Francisca (aka Frankie). =Cypress Hill (1988‚Äì2004)= After linking up with B-Real and Sen Dog to form the group Cypress Hill,[Cypress Hill: Still Smokin' (The Ultimate Video Collection )(bonus Features).] he went on to produce seven studio albums with the group from 1991 to 2004. Of the seven, four reached platinum status, and three gold. Meanwhile, he scored hits on the side with Ice Cube's \\"Check Yo Self\\" and House of Pain's \\"Jump Around.\\" During Cypress Hill's early years, DJ Muggs met The Alchemist and his Dilated Peoples brethren on tour, deciding to take the young producer under his wing, providing a jump-start for his career. =Soul Assassins= In 1997, Muggs released an album under the name Soul Assassins. The album, Soul Assassins I, reached #86 on the Billboard 200 and earned critical praise. Produced by Muggs, it featured Dr. Dre, B-Real, LA Tha Darkman, Mobb Deep, RZA, GZA, Goodie Mob, KRS-One and Wyclef Jean. In 2000 he returned to the Soul Assassins with Soul Assassins II, which reached only #178 on the charts but garnered similarly positive reviews. He also put out the record Dust, an atmosphere-heavy trip hop affair with Greg Dulli, Amy Trujillo and Everlast on vocals. After the 2004 album Til Death Do Us Part, which reached #23 on the Billboard 200, Cypress Hill went on a hiatus from recording, enabling its members to focus more on their side projects. =Further solo projects and return of Cypress Hill (2005‚Äì2010)= In 2005, DJ Muggs teamed up with Wu-Tang Clan's GZA for the album Grandmasters, the first project released on his label Angeles Records. Patterned after a chess game, it received positive reviews; Muggs also announced a Soul Assassins III album, produced jointly by himself and Alchemist, reportedly to be preceded by a record called Cloak & Dagger, also featuring Alchemist. Instead, Muggs produced an album for Psycho Realm member Sick Jacken, Legend of the Mask and the Assassin two years later, in 2007. In 2008, Muggs announced that his album with California rapper Planet Asia would be the third Soul Assassins album, but the two released Pain Language later that year as a simple collaboration. Before the release of his solo album Smoke N Mirrors in 2009, B-Real reported that Cypress Hill has been working on an album for roughly a year. Currently in the mixing phase, Muggs has produced half of the album's material so far, going to DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Mike Shinoda for the rest. In 2009, Muggs entered the Gumball 3000 cross-country race, and on June 23, 2009, Soul Assassins: Intermission was released, featuring RZA, Prodigy, Evidence, The Alchemist and Bun B. The first single for the album was \\"Gangsta Shit,\\" by Bun B and M1 of Dead Prez. Despite its high-profile guest list, the release was met with lukewarm reception, and Muggs later clarified its status as a preview before the release of Soul Assassins III, the next full-fledged installment of his Soul Assassins series. Muggs plans next on recording his 5th V.S. album with group member B-Real. & in 2013 he confirmed a VS album with Meyhem Lauren as well. On the Soul Assassins official website, it was also revealed that Muggs will contribute Production to the album from rapper Apathy, Honkey Kong, which was released August 23, 2011. The Track is Titled \\"Fear Itself\\" In 2011, Muggs announced the release of a new album entitled Bass for Your Face, which he described as a West Coast Dubstep album. In October 2011, Muggs confirmed via his Twitter account that Public Enemy frontman Chuck D would contribute to the album, and the lead single would feature UK artist Dizzee Rascal and Los Angeles upstart MC Bambu. = Cross My Heart Hope To Die = Muggs returned to the trip hop genre by teaming up with vocalist BREVI, fellow producer Andrew Kline (from the hardcore punk band Strife) and Sean Bonner, who served as a curator, hacker and creative technologist of the project. CMHHTD released their debut four-track self-titled extended play on April 2, 2013, and it was promoted by three music videos \\"Wild Side\\", \\"Miracles\\" and \\"Roller Coasting\\". On July 29, 2014, the band released their second extended play, Vita E Morte, it was supported by two music videos \\"Two Shots\\" and \\"Tears Of God\\". Both EPs were released via Alpha Pup Records and also were released later as Cross My Heart Hope To Die eight-track album.

This world was designated Earth-9811 in Marvel Encyclopedia: Fantastic Four. Issue #-1, What if...starring Bishop (based on Uncanny X-Men #282), was published as a part of the \\"Flashback\\" event, in which most of Marvel's series published issues numbered \\"-1\\" that were set in the past. Marvel Alterniverse The Alterniverse was what Marvel briefly labeled their What If stories from 1995‚Äì1996. The stories told under the Alterniverse label are typically one-shots and limited series, such as Ruins, Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe, and The Last Avengers Story. Volume 3 (2005) A series of What If one-shot issues was released cover- dated February 2005. *What if Karen Page had lived? *What if Doctor Doom had become the Thing? *What if General Ross had become the Hulk? *What if Jessica Jones had joined the Avengers? *What if Professor X and Magneto formed the X-Men together? *What if Aunt May had died instead of Uncle Ben? *Wha‚ÄîHuh? (humor issue) The series, including the \\"Wha-Huh?\\" humor issue, was later collected into a trade paperback entitled What If: Why Not. Volume 4 (early 2006) The February 2006 one-shot issues took place in a single fictional universe, dubbed Earth-717 in previews, with four of the six stories more like DC's Elseworlds with various heroes in historical periods. *What if Captain America had lived in the American Civil War? *What if the Fantastic Four were Russian cosmonauts? *What if the Sub-Mariner had grown up on land instead of Atlantis? *What if Daredevil had lived in feudal Japan? *What if Thor was a Herald of Galactus? *What if Wolverine was Public Enemy Number One? The series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled What If: Mirror Mirror. Volume 5 (late 2006) The November 2006 one-shot issues were based on major storylines or crossovers: *What If: Avengers Disassembled - What if the Scarlet Witch had not acted alone? *What If: Spider-Man: The Other - What if Peter Parker had rejected his inner spider? *What If: Wolverine: Enemy of the State - What if Wolverine was never deprogrammed? *What If: Age of Apocalypse - What if both Xavier and Magneto were killed by Legion? *What If: X-Men: Deadly Genesis - What if Vulcan became the leader of the X-Men? The series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled What If: Event Horizon featuring the cover from the Spider-Man one-shot. Volume 6 (2007) The sixth series of What If? continued the theme of the previous series of examining possible alternatives for major storylines. *What If: Planet Hulk ** What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction on Sakaar instead of the Hulk? ** What if the Hulk had landed on the planet the Illuminati had intended for him? ** What if the Hulk had reverted to Bruce Banner when he crashed on Sakaar? *What If: Annihilation ** What if the Annihilation Wave reached Earth? *What If: X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire ** What if Vulcan absorbed the energies of the M'Kraan Crystal and became Phoenix? *What If: Civil War ** What if Captain America led all the heroes against the Superhero Registration Act? ** What if Iron Man lost the Civil War? *What If: Spider-Man vs. Wolverine ** What if Spider-Man had remained in 1980s Russia after an accidental death? *What If : Featuring Thor The series was also due to feature What If?: The New Fantastic Four, which featured the \\"original\\" New Fantastic Four with Spider-Man, Wolverine, the Ghost Rider, and the Hulk teaming up, as seen in Fantastic Four #347-349 and #374. This story was halted due to the passing of artist Mike Wieringo, and was released as a 48-Page Special as a tribute in June 2008. All the issues of this run, aside from the New Fantastic Four one, were later collected into a trade paperback simply entitled What If? Civil War. The version of the \\"New\\" Fantastic Four is also erroneous, as the Ghost Rider of that time period had been Danny Ketch, not Johnny Blaze, who appears in the issue instead for unexplained reasons (in reality, Wieringo had drawn the wrong Ghost Rider in his initial pages by mistake and it was not noticed until after his death). Volume 7 (2008) This series continues the theme of alternatives for three recent Marvel events along with two around a classic event. The New Fantastic Four story was a sequel to the one-shot What If? released previously, seeing Iron Man replace Ghost Rider in an alternate take on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline. However, this series also features a storyline featuring the Runaways that runs through all five comics. This series was released between December 2008 and January 2009. * What If: House of M - What if the Scarlet Witch had said 'No more powers' instead of 'No more mutants'? * What If: Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America - What if Iron Man had been killed instead of Captain America? * What If: Newer Fantastic Four - What if the New Fantastic Four had battled Thanos? * What If: Spider-Man: Back in Black - What if Mary Jane had been shot instead of Aunt May? * What If: Secret Wars - What if Doctor Doom had kept the Beyonder's power? * What If: Runaways - What if the Runaways had become the Young Avengers? (Runs though all five above issues) The seventh series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled What If?: Secret Wars featuring the cover from the Secret Wars one-shot. Volume 8 (2009) At Fan Expo Canada '09, it was revealed a new five-part What If series would be released, featuring five one-shot issues, each with two alternatives for the focused event, except for Daredevil vs. Elektra, which had only one story. As a back-up feature in the other four one-shot issues, there is a humorous Say What? short story. *What If? Spider-Man: House of M ** What if Emma Frost had not mindwiped Gwen Stacy? ** What if the Scarlet Witch had let Gwen Stacy and her son cross to the default reality and survive? *What If? Secret Invasion ** What if Reed Richards had been killed before revealing the Skrull weakness and the Skrulls won? ** What if the Skrulls had kept the invasion secret throughout all the campaign? *What If? World War Hulk ** What if Tony Stark had not hesitated to use the Red Satellite on the Hulk in the final battle? ** What if Thor had battled the Hulk instead of the Sentry? *What If? Daredevil vs. Elektra ** What if Daredevil had been shot and resurrected by the Hand instead of Elektra? *What If? Astonishing X-Men ** What if Ord had resurrected Jean Grey instead of Colossus? ** What if Ultron became aware of Danger during her battle with the X-Men and planned to make her his bride? The eighth series was later collected into a trade paperback entitled What If?: Secret Invasion featuring the cover from the Secret Invasion one-shot. Volume 9 (2010) In early September 2010, Marvel announced a series of new What If? issues, including the celebration of the 200th issue of What If?. It features a story regarding the Siege event, and a story by Stan Lee about the Watcher and Galactus. Further What If stories were released for Dark Reign, Spider-Man: Grim Hunt, a story focusing on Wolverine and his son Daken, and another on the pre-hero and villain lives of Iron Man and Doctor Doom. Those four issues also have a back-up story on Deadpool being controlled by the Venom symbiote. The Venom/Deadpool backup chapters were subsequently released as a stand-alone one- shot.https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/37991/what_if_venomdeadpool_2010_1 *What If?

What If?: Avengers vs. X-Men (2013) In July 2013, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries for What If based on the 2012 event Avengers vs X-Men, telling the story of what might have happened if Magneto had been more influential in Hope's development for Phoenix. What If: Age of Ultron (2014) In April 2014, Marvel released a five-issue miniseries for the 2013 event Age of Ultron, focusing on Wolverine and the Invisible Woman's trip back in time to kill Hank Pym in order to stop him from creating Ultron and showing the effects for the Marvel Universe if one of the other four founding Avengers had died, or if Hank had simply chosen not to create Ultron at all. * What if the Wasp had been killed instead of Hank Pym? * What if Iron Man had been killed instead of Hank Pym? * What if Thor had been killed instead of Hank Pym? * What if Captain America had been killed instead of Hank Pym? * What if Hank Pym had never created Ultron at all? What If? Infinity (2015) In October 2015, Marvel released a five-issue miniseries for the 2013 event Infinity that depicted alternate outcomes for Thanos' invasion of Earth and the war with the Builders. The five scenarios are the following: *What if Thanos had joined the Avengers?What If? Infinity - Thanos #1 *What if Black Bolt had betrayed Earth?What If? Infinity - Inhumans #1 *What if the X-Men were the sole survivors of Infinity?What If? Infinity - X-Men #1 *What if the Guardians of the Galaxy tried to free Thanos?What If?

With Great Power (2018) Marvel released a new series of What If? one-shot issues in October 2018, which revived the concept of the publisher's classic series that examines alternate outcomes for major storylines and alternate versions of well-known characters such as Spider-Man, Magik, the Ghost Rider, Thor, the X-Men and the Punisher. *What if Flash Thompson became Spider-Man?What If?

Improved technology allowed coal to fuel the Industrial Revolution, greatly increasing the consumption of coal. In economics, the Jevons paradox (; sometimes Jevons effect) occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that resource rises due to increasing demand. The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics. However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising. In 1865, the English economist William Stanley Jevons observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption. The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption rebound effects from improved energy efficiency. In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates economic growth, further increasing the demand for resources. The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used. Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as cap and trade or green taxes) can be used to control the rebound effect. History William Stanley Jevons, after whom the paradox is named The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist William Stanley Jevons in his 1865 book The Coal Question. Jevons observed that England's consumption of coal soared after James Watt introduced the Watt steam engine, which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired steam engine from Thomas Newcomen's earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in fuel efficiency tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: \\"It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth.\\" At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem. Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, water usage and interpersonal contact. It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics. Cause Elastic Demand: A 20% increase in efficiency causes a 40% increase in travel. Fuel consumption increases and the Jevons paradox occurs. Inelastic Demand: A 20% increase in efficiency causes a 10% increase in travel. The Jevons paradox does not occur. Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the demand for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the cost of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a good or service will increase the quantity demanded (the law of demand). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the rebound effect, and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in fuel use from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains. The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur. Khazzoom‚ÄìBrookes postulate In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's energy use. Brookes, then chief economist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission. In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in energy efficiency work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the Khazzoom‚ÄìBrookes postulate, and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical growth theory (the mainstream economic theory of capital accumulation, technological progress and long-run economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom‚ÄìBrookes postulate occurs in the neoclassical growth model under a wide range of assumptions. According to Saunders, increased energy efficiency tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the microeconomic level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption. That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the macroeconomic level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use. Energy conservation policy Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom‚ÄìBrookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels. There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use. However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited. The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher. The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that sustainable energy policy must rely on other types of government interventions as well. As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect. To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. green taxes, cap and trade, or higher emissions standards). The ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be \\"taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation.\\" By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.

Popular music The history of modern Gabonese music did not begin until about 1974, when the blind guitarist and singer Pierre Akendengu√© released his first album. He was classically trained in Europe, and his compositions reflect the influence of Western classical music. Akendengue's European career started after being treated for eye disease at a hospital in Paris. He stayed, and studied at the Petit Conservatoire. By the 1970s, he was at the forefront of a wave of popular Francophone African music stars, beginning with the release of Nandipo in 1974. Akendegue was supported by Pierre Barouh, a powerful man in the French music industry, responsible for launching the careers of Brigitte Fontaine and Jacques Higelin, among others. Akendegue came to be seen as a spokesperson for the Gabonese people, and for the poor and dispossessed of all Africa. After spending twenty years in France, Akendegue returned to Gabon despite concerns over government censorship of his music. He wound up being appointed a government advisor. The 1980s saw the formation of Africa No. 1, a radio station devoted to African music, and the opening of the first Gabonese recording studio, Studio Mademba. Musicians from across Africa and even in the Caribbean travelled to Libreville to record. Though Libreville was producing enough pan-African hits in the 80s to rival cities like Abidjan and Johannesburg for popular music, the end of the decade saw the music scene die out.

An out-of-print book is a book that is no longer being published. The term can apply to specific editions of more popular works, which may then go in and out of print repeatedly, or to the sole printed edition of a work, which is not picked up again by any future publishers for reprint. Most works that have ever been published are out of print at any given time, while certain highly popular books, such as the Bible, are always \\"in print\\". Less popular out-of-print books are often rare and may be difficult to acquire unless scanned or electronic copies of the books are available. With the advent of book scanning, and print-on-demand technology, fewer and fewer works are now considered truly out of print. A publisher creates a print run of a fixed number of copies of a new book. Print runs for most modern books number in the thousands. These books can be ordered in bulk by booksellers, and when all the bookseller's copies are sold, the bookseller has the option to order additional copies. If the initial print run sells out and demand still exists, the publisher will have more copies printed, if possible. When the book is no longer selling either at a rate fast enough to pay for the inventory or stock costs, or to justify another print run, the publisher will cease to print additional copies, and may remainder or pulp the remaining unsold copies. When all of the books in a print run have been sold to booksellers, the book is said to be \\"out of print\\", meaning that a bookseller cannot get any further copies from the publisher. If a book sells out unexpectedly quickly, it may be considered out of print briefly when its initial print run is exhausted, but is usually soon reprinted. Publishers may choose to list a book as \\"out of stock indefinitely\\", instead of declaring it out of print, as the publisher may have to give up copyright when declaring it out of print. Publishers will often let a book go out of stock for long periods, then reprint the book, usually with a new cover and formatting, to catch the presumably built up demand for the book. The author or their estate may have copyright reverted to them once the publisher has declared it out of print. The longer a book has been out of print, the more difficult it may be to obtain a copy. If there is enough demand for an out-of-print book, and all copyright issues can be resolved, another publisher may republish the book in the same manner as the original publisher might have reprinted it. In some cases, an out-of-print book, even one that sold very poorly, may be republished if the author becomes popular again. A reader who wishes to purchase an out-of-print book must either find a bookseller that still has a copy, wait for another print run, or find someone who will sell their own copy as a used book. The advent of the Internet has made this process much easier, as many websites sell used books offered by bookstores and individuals. Some publishers intentionally limit the print run of some or all titles to fewer copies than the anticipated demand, in creating limited editions marketed to collectors. In these cases, there is an implicit or explicit promise to collectors that the book will not be reprinted, at least in the same form as originally published.

It was named after Polish military commander and American Revolutionary War fighter Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski (Casimir Pulaski) because of the large Polish-American population in Greenpoint. It connects 11th Street in Queens to McGuinness Boulevard (formerly Oakland Street) in Brooklyn. Description Designed by Frederick Zurmuhlen, the Pulaski Bridge is a bascule bridge, a type of drawbridge. It carries six lanes of traffic and a pedestrian sidewalk over the water, Long Island Rail Road tracks, and the entrance to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The pedestrian sidewalk is on the west or downstream side of the bridge, which has views of the industrial areas surrounding Newtown Creek, the skyline of Manhattan, and of a number of other bridges, including the Williamsburg Bridge, the Queensboro Bridge, and the Kosciuszko Bridge. The bridge was reconstructed between 1991 and 1994. Located just over from the start of the New York City Marathon at the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Pulaski Bridge serves as the approximate halfway point in the race. History The Pulaski Bridge opened to traffic on September 10, 1954. It served as a replacement for the nearby Vernon Avenue Bridge, which had linked Vernon Avenue in Long Island City with Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint. From 1979 until 1990, a message reading \\"Wheels Over Indian Trails\\" was painted on the Pulaski Bridge over the approach to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The artwork was created by John Fekner as a tribute to the thirteen Native American tribes who inhabited Long Island. The bascule draw span open In 2012, in response to the lack of adequate bicycle facilities currently on the Pulaski Bridge, the NYC Department of Transportation began studying the possibility of installing dedicated bicycle lanes on the bridge.Miller, Stephen. \\"DOT Begins Study of Dedicated Pulaski Bridge Bike Lane\\". Streetsblog.org. November 21, 2012. Since the Pulaski is a drawbridge with an open section in the middle, it presents several challenges not faced by other bridges. First, physical dividers must be lightweight yet securely installed so they don't come loose when the drawbridge is opened. Secondly, the joints where the two leaves come together must be somehow protected to make them more bicycle wheel-friendly. In April 2013, in a letter to Assembly Member Joe Lentol, the NYC Department of Transportation Commissioner stated that the proposal for a two-way dedicated bike lane, which would convert the existing walkway to a pedestrian-only path, had met the requirements of a traffic analysis and that an engineering study and recommendations would be made by the end of the year.Miller, Stephen. \\"Pulaski Bridge Bike Lane OK‚Äôd by DOT Traffic Study; Engineering Review Next.\\" Streetsblog.org. May 3, 2013. On October 25, 2013, Lentol announced that the DOT was in the process of designing a dedicated bike lane and that the final design would be presented to community board 1 in Brooklyn and Community Board 2 in Queens before the end of the year. Bike lane construction was originally projected to occur late spring or early summer of 2014.Aaron, Brad. \\"Lentol: DOT Will Finalize Design for Pulaski Protected Bike Lane This Year.\\" Streetsblog.org.

Her most popular songs are \\"Do You Miss Me\\", \\"A Little Bit of Ecstasy\\", and the Stars on 54 (Ultra Nate, Amber, and Jocelyn Enriquez) cover of Gordon Lightfoot's \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\". Her success helped inspire and pave the way for many Asian American, particularly Filipino Americans from the San Francisco Bay Area, artists during the mid to late 1990's such as Buffy, Kai, One Vo1ce, Pinay, Sharyn Maceren, and others. Career Enriquez was first heard singing at the age of 3 along to Anita Ward's \\"Ring My Bell.\\" During her childhood she received formal voice training with the San Francisco Girl Chorus and San Francisco Opera Company. During high school she briefly joined girl group, Pinay Divas (later known as Pinay), a reference to girl group En Vogue who were known as the Funky Divas. She continued to perform around the Bay Area and eventually a demo of her singing \\"If You Leave Me Now\\" by Jaya catch the attention of Classified Records. In late 1993 she recorded \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" and in early 1994 the single was a success. \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" would garner a huge Freestyle fanbase with the East Mix which included a popular Freestyle sample at the time of the Afrika Bambaataa & Soul Sonic Force's \\"Planet Rock\\". The single gained heavy rotation in California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, and New York. As an homage to Victor Zaragoza, the DJ who in part broke the record on Enriquez's hometown radio station Wild 107.7, she recorded the song in Spanish too. Ironically, Enriquez was inappropriately labeled as a \\"sell-out\\" by some members of the Philippine- American community because of her Spanish rendition of \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\", it is ironic and inappropriate considering that the Philippines is a Hispanic nation having been part of the Spanish Empire for over three centuries. Her debut album, Lovely was released in the summer of 1994, which was produced by Glenn Gutierrez and Mario L. Augustin Jr (who also worked with Stevie B. and Jaya), and Elvin Reyes. The album Lovely spawned several more singles \\"Make This Last Forever\\", \\"You Are The One\\", \\"Big Love\\", \\"Big Love (Energy Box Mixes)\\", and \\"Only\\". The second single \\"Make This Last Forever\\" was well received in the markets that supported the first single. Lovely, was released the summer of 1994. The third single released in the fall of 1994 \\"You Are The One\\" led her to perform in San Diego where she would be introduced to her future husband. The fourth single \\"Big Love\\" was heavily inspired by Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\" would also be re-recorded, remixed and released as \\"Big Love (Energy Box Mixes)\\" as the albums fifth single. The last single \\"Only\\" was released on 12\\" and notably a fan favorite from the album. \\"Do You Miss Me?\\" became a Top 40 hit on dance and pop radio (#17 and #38 peaks, respectively), and peaked at #49 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single was also successful outside of the U.S. where it reached #7 in Singapore and was a Top 20 Pop hit in Canada. The music video was shot over a year later as the single maintained a popularity into 1997. Pop punk band Lucky Boys Confusion later covered \\"Do You Miss Me\\" on their 2001 album Throwing the Game. In 1996, Classified Records formed a joint venture with Tommy Boy Records and its imprint Timber! Records, this catapulted \\"Do You Miss Me?\\" as an international hit. Her second album, Jocelyn was released in 1997 and peaked at #182 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and at #11 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. \\"A Little Bit of Ecstasy\\" peaked at #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart and #55 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video was directed by Francis Lawrence who went on to direct Jennifer Lopez's \\"Waiting For Tonight\\" music video and the box office hits \\"I Am Legend\\" and \\"Hunger Games\\". \\"A Little Bit of Ecstasy\\" was licensed to the DDRMAX2 PlayStation 2 game. The success of the single also led her perform on MTV's \\"The Grind\\" and included in the box office hit \\"A Night At The Roxbury\\". The single was originally intended to be released in the fall of 1996 however Jocelyn's high school knee injury caught up to her and was not able to walk. However, due to scheduling she still recorded the video with an injured knee. As a compromise Jocelyn was lifted around set and stayed stationary for her shots. After filming she had surgery and returned to the stage for the San Francisco Bammie Awards in early 1997. She won for \\"Artist of the Year\\" and performed \\"A Little Bit of Ecstasy\\" for the first time. The \\"Jocelyn\\" album, saw three US commercially released singles \\"Do You Miss Me\\", \\"A Little Bit Of Ecstasy\\", and \\"Get Into The Rhythm\\". \\"Even If\\" was opted as a single, Soul Solution provided a remix, however the single never happened. \\"Stay With Me\\" was exclusively released as a single in Brazil. This album would lead Jocelyn to return to the Philippines, she'd not travelled to since childhood at this point, for the \\"Jocelyn\\" album tour. She made several appearances on TV and radio along with performances in various venues. Unfortunately, the joint venture between her labels Classified Records and Tommy Boy Music (along with Timber! Records) ended and Enriquez stayed with Tommy Boy. She began working on material for her then third album which was intended to venture Jocelyn in a more Pop/R&B; sound incorporating her Dance audience as well. In 1998 Stars on 54, which consisted of Enriquez, Amber, Ultra Nate, joined for a cover the Gordon Lightfoot 1971 hit \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" produced by The Berman Brothers. The Stars On 54 rendition of ‚ÄúIf You Could Read My Mind‚Äù wound up impacting various charts worldwide, while in the U.S. it landed at No. 3 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs and No. 52 on the Hot 100. After 54's film initial cut was chopped significantly, followed by reshoots, the Stars on 54 performed at the end of the film in the theatrical released edit. Enriquez's response to appearing in the film \\"My hair was so huge, oh my goodness. It was crazy! To be able film it at the actual venue, that was pretty cool.\\" The birth of her first child lead to a brief hiatus and a halt in her third album. In 2000, she returned with the Thunderpuss 2000 produced \\"When I Get Close to You\\" and hit #1 on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. This marked a more mature sound for Jocelyn and eventually lead her to being the vocalist for the Thunderpuss track \\"So Fabulous, So Fierce (Freak Out)\\", an interpolation of the disco anthem Chic's \\"Le Freak\\". The song appeared on the Disney \\"102 Dalmatians\\" film/soundtrack, and also appears in the Dance Dance Revolution video game series. After landing a distribution deal in 2002 she launched her own label JEM Entertainment. In 2003, Enriquez released her third album, All My Life. The first single of the album \\"No Way No How\\", produced by Al B Rich, peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The second and last single from the album was \\"Why\\". She then decided to focus on her family and take a brake from the industry. In 2018, she returned to recording music and released the single \\"To Love Again\\" and followed up with a remix package. The 20 year anniversary of \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" was also celebrated by Billboard Ultra Nat√©, Amber and Jocelyn Enriquez on Their 1998 Stars on 54 Collaboration 'If You Could Read My Mind'. Jocelyn noted with the recording process \\"They said, ‚ÄúThis is a good opportunity, but you have to go now!‚Äù I want to say I was in New York within three days so that I could record the song. We would all sing different harmonies and ad-libs, but never really saw the big picture until the end. So it was kind of mysterious how we recorded it.\\" Jocelyn embarked on a Philippines tour in 2019 to promote \\"To Be In Love Again.\\" In 2020, she released a re-recorded version of \\"You Are The One\\". Production duo Black Caviar released a cover of \\"A Little Bit of Ecstasy\\" in January 2020. Her latest single is \\"Beauty Comes Through Pain\\" and also complimented by a remix single. Personal life She graduated from Pinole Valley High School in 1993. Enriquez is married to Pastor Alain Macasadia. They formerly served at Calvary Chapel of San Diego doing worship and children's ministry. They moved to San Antonio in 2005. In 2006, Macasadia became the worship leader of Calvary Chapel San Antonio. They have four children, Matthew, Ashley, Jonathan, and Timothy.

Community The neighbourhood radiates out from the intersection of Gladstone and Fernwood Roads, where the Belfry Theatre, The Fernwood Inn, Little June Cafe, and Luna Collective, each occupy a corner. This dynamic urban village also boasts: Mesa Familiar, Stage Wine Bar (identified by EnRoute Magazine as one of the top 10 new restaurants in Canada the year it opened), Studio 1313 Hair Salon, The Yoga Den, Soma Active Health, Tonic Spa-tique, Fly the Cage Tattoo Studio, Who-Dyd-Your-Hair, The Paint Box School of Art, Aubergine Specialty Foods, Freedom Kilts, and 7 Rays New Age Store. The Belfry Theatre has been producing plays in the heart of Fernwood since 1976. A thriving music and arts scene has resulted in events such as FernFest (since 1995), and the Fernwood Art Stroll (since 2008) which take place annually during the fourth weekend in June. Little Fernwood Hall houses The Pandora Arts Collective, Little Fernwood Gallery, and Theatre Inconnu. The neighbourhood is enlivened by 3 vibrant schools with active extra-curricular programs, community celebrations, and involved Parent Advisory Councils: Victoria High School (the oldest public high school west of Winnipeg and north of San Francisco), Central Middle School, and George Jay Elementary. Several registered preschools and day care programs also nurture young families in the area. The Compost Education Centre, two allotment gardens, and Spring Ridge Commons (a permaculture garden) are community-initiated projects that contribute to the character of the area. Fernwood is also home to many wellness and recreational groups, including the Fernwood Football Association (soccer). Since 1979, Fernwood Neighbourhood Resource Group (Fernwood NRG) has provided child care, family support programs, and recreational activities through the Fernwood Community Centre. Fernwood NRG opened the Cornerstone Cafe and the Cornerstone Building affordable housing apartments in 2006, and in 2008 opened Park Place affordable housing apartments. In 2013, Fernwood NRG opened Studio 1313 Hair Design. These social enterprises continue to be operated by Fernwood NRG with all proceeds re-invested into neighbourhood programs and services (including events like FernFest & Telephone Pole Painting). The Fernwood Community Centre is home to a Community Orchard & Kitchen Garden Pilot Project. These projects demonstrate new ways of growing food in the City of Victoria in visible, public places. The Fernwood Community Association facilitates land use discussions (between developers, residents, and the City), oversees emergency preparedness and safety issues, operates the two neighbourhood allotment gardens, and provides meeting space in Little Fernwood Hall for various community gatherings including Cafe Sympatico and recovery support groups. Fernwood is known throughout the city as a particularly warm, creative, and engaged neighbourhood. Fernwood is sometimes referred to as 'funky Fernwood' for its creative spirit and community vibe. The 'Fernwood Murder' of crows roosts on Walnut street before nightfall during the summer and is noted on the Fernwood Community Map.  History  The Fernwood area was part of the territory originally inhabited by the Songhees prior to the establishment of Fort Victoria. It is believed that a Songhees village may have been located at what is today Cadboro Bay.Ellis, John J. The Fernwood Files Orca Book Publishers, 1989, p. 11 With the establishment of Fort Victoria, a trail linking the fort to Cadboro Bay ran through the area that would become Fernwood and was used by aboriginals and Europeans. Bishop Edward Cridge described the area as it was in the 1850s as \\"open country without a house or field till we arrived at the Company's farm [Cadboro Bay Farm]\\".Ellis, p. 13 Early European settlers in the area included John Work, born in Donegal, Ireland who developed the Hillside Farm on the northwest edge of today's Fernwood,Ellis, p. 21 and Benjamin Pearse, born in Devonshire, England . Pearse owned land between Denman Street and Pandora Avenue, bounded by Fernwood Road on the west and Belmont Avenue on the east. His home, Fernwood Manor, constructed in 1860, gave its name to the neighbourhood.Ellis, p. 27 After Pearse's death in 1902, Pearse's second wife, Sarah Jane Pearse resided there until her death in 1954. Fernwood Manor stood at Vining and Begbie Streets for 109 years before its demolition in 1969.Ellis, p. 39 Historically, a spring in Fernwood supplied Victoria with its main source of water, hence the earlier name of the neighbourhood, Springridge.Ellis, p. 40 In 1875 Victoria began piping water from Elk Lake, and in 1885, the site of the original springs became the location of the Empire Brewery.Ellis p. 47 Residential development began in earnest in the 1890s,Ellis, p. 50 and many homes in western Fernwood and along Fernwood Road itself date from this era. In the early 1900s a large area west of Fernwood Road was used as a sand and gravel pit to supply construction materials to local builders, to the dismay of many early residents.Ellis, p52 The problem was partly solved by the construction of the present Victoria High School in 1912 on some of the lands that had been used as the sand and gravel pit. Central Middle School stands on the site of the first public school, a wood-frame schoolhouse built in 1853 on the colonial school reserve.Ellis, p. 57Segger, Martin and Douglas Franklin, \\"Exploring Victoria's Architecture\\", Sono Nis Press, Victoria, 1996, p. 201 This building was replaced in 1876 by a building designed by Victoria architect John Teague, who also designed the Dominion Customs House on Wharf Street and Victoria City Hall. In turn, the 1876 school was replaced in 1902 by a brick building designed by Francis Rattenbury.Ellis pp. 59-60 However, the increase in Victoria's population in the early 1900s made this building inadequate within 12 years. The present Central Middle School (formerly Central Junior High School), built in 1952, was designed by the Victoria architectural firm Birley Wade Stockdill.Segger, p. 201 The commercial heart of Fernwood developed along Fernwood road in the 1890s and early 1900s and many of the commercial buildings in the village date from this time in part due to the intersection of Gladstone road and Fernwood road acting as the terminus of the streetcar line connecting the neighbourhood to downtown. The building now housing the Belfry Theatre was built in 1892 as Emmanuel Baptist Church.Ellis, p. 82 Another small commercial node developed along Haultain Road. Most of the Fernwood neighbourhood was built up by the end of the real estate boom of 1913.

Fatal Vision focuses on Captain Jeffrey R. MacDonald, M.D. and the February 17, 1970 murders of his wife and their two children at their home on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1979, MacDonald was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to life in prison. McGinniss was hired by MacDonald, prior to the start of the criminal trial, but he later became convinced that MacDonald was guilty, and the book supported MacDonald's conviction. The book sold well, and gave rise to a miniseries of the same name on NBC the next year. The book led to MacDonald suing McGinniss, a case that was settled out of court. The book and its conclusions were challenged by several subsequent publications. MacDonald murders and trial In the early morning hours of February 17, 1970, at their home on Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Green Beret Captain Jeffrey MacDonald, M.D., was injured, and his pregnant wife and two young daughters were murdered. MacDonald told Army investigators that they had been attacked by multiple assailants; the details were reminiscent of the sensational Tate- LaBianca murders of the preceding year. After several months of investigation, Army lawyers charged MacDonald with the three murders, leading to a three- months-plus adversarial hearing that recommended he not be prosecuted. In 1971, his father-in-law, Freddy Kassab, became progressively suspicious of MacDonald and sought formal reopening of the case. In July 1974, a Federal judge acted on a citizen's criminal complaint by Kassab and others, by putting the case before a grand jury. MacDonald was indicted for all three murders in January 1975, and after two rounds of appeals to Appeal and Supreme Courts, went to trial on July 16, 1979. After a six-week criminal trial, MacDonald was convicted of second-degree murder of his wife and older daughter and of first- degree murder of his younger daughter on August 29, 1979 and was immediately sentenced to three consecutive life terms (equivalent to life imprisonment). Afterwards, MacDonald raised further appeals, one of which set him free on bail for about 15 months before yet another reversal by the Supreme Court in March 1982. Fatal Vision In June 1979, MacDonald had hired McGinniss to write a book about MacDonald's innocence. Between the Supreme Court's denial of review and the trial date, MacDonald arranged with McGinniss to interview him, attend the trial, and write a book about the case. But McGinniss later became convinced that MacDonald was guilty of murdering his family. In the spring of 1983, McGinniss published Fatal Vision, saying that he had become convinced of MacDonald's guilt early in his research due to MacDonald's behavior and the court evidence, and presenting detailed arguments for guilt. As a motive, McGinniss suggests that MacDonald killed his family in a spur-of- the-moment, fit of psychotic rage as a result of taking amphetamines. Around the time of the murders Fort Bragg had been experiencing problems and crime associated with drug-addicted soldiers returning from Vietnam. Lawsuits MacDonald expected that the book would show his innocence; however, like other authors MacDonald had contacted, McGinniss insisted on a signed release from MacDonald, allowing him to write freely, and the final version was precisely the opposite of what MacDonald had expected. In 1984, MacDonald sued McGinniss for fraud and breach of contract, claiming he had breached an agreement to write a book about his innocence. In August 1987, the jury hearing the case deadlocked, and the case was settled out of court in November with MacDonald receiving $325,000. The Kassabs, MacDonald's in-laws, then sued MacDonald to try and prevent him from profiting from a crime for which he had been convicted. This suit was also settled, with the Kassabs receiving a percentage of the book's profit, but also paying for MacDonald's legal expenses. Subsequent publications In 1990, The New Yorker writer Janet Malcolm published an article, \\"The Journalist and the Murderer\\", with the thesis that journalism inevitably conflicts with morality as it is usually conceived; she considered Fatal Vision as the specific case leading her to this conclusion, and said that McGinniss committed a \\"morally indefensible\\" act in pretending that he believed MacDonald was innocent, even after he became convinced of his guilt. In 1995, Jerry Allen Potter and Fred Bost published Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the MacDonald Murders, attacking the murder jury's conclusions. In 2012, Errol Morris published A Wilderness of Error reviewing the MacDonald case, including discussions of McGinniss's book and Malcolm's book. In 2012, McGinniss published Final Vision: The Last Word on Jeffrey MacDonald, rebutting MacDonald's case in his multiple post-1983 appeals.\\"Joe McGinniss counters Errol Morris' 'Fatal Vision' claims: 'No doubt' that Jeffrey MacDonald has blood on his hands\\" Daily News Online Book Blog, December 14, 2012.

This eastern boundary current branches south from the North Atlantic Current and flows southwest about as far as Senegal where it turns west and later joins the Atlantic North Equatorial Current. The current is named after the Canary Islands. The archipelago partially blocks the flow of the Canary Current (Gyory, 2007). This wide and slow moving current is thought to have been exploited in the early Phoenician navigation and settlement along the coast of western Morocco. The ancient Phoenicians not only exploited numerous fisheries within this current zone, but also established a factory at Iles Purpuraires off present day Essaouira for extracting a Tyrian purple dye from a marine gastropod murex species. Upwelling A prominent feature of Eastern Boundary Currents is the presence of upwelling. Ekman drift causes offshore transport of surface waters, which are then replaced with deep water from below. Deep waters are cold and nutrient-rich and have a key role in stimulating primary productivity. Upwelling has led to the enhancement of coastal fisheries in western Morocco (Hance, 1975). Major upwelling occurs between 23 and 25 degrees northern latitude (Canary Current, 2002). Upwelling occurs year-round at Cap Blanc (Ras Nouadhibou) and northward. South of Cap Blanc, upwelling is limited to winter and spring due to the northward migration of the Azores high during summer, which is responsible for driving equatorward winds. Minas et al. (1982) showed that at the latitude of Cap Blanc, a front exists that separates North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) and South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). SACW, to the south of Cap Blanc, is richer in nutrients than NACW. A poleward subsurface counter-current is responsible for bringing SACW to the Cap Blanc region resulting in maximal primary production. Primary production to the north is limited by nutrient availability in NACW. Primary production to the south of Cap Blanc is limited by the occurrence of upwelling events. =Upwelling and primary production= Huntsman and Barber (1977) hypothesized that high productivity results from alternating upwelling events and relatively calm periods. Upwelling is necessary to bring the nutrients to the surface but if the event is sustained for a long period of time, it is tough for phytoplankton to remain in the euphotic zone. Calm periods allow for stratification to develop, which means that phytoplankton can grow and multiply while held in the shallow mixed layer. In other words, there is a miniature spring bloom during each calm period (Mann & Lazier, 1996). =Upwelling and zooplankton= Upwelling and primary production follow the onset of a strong wind within a few days (Mann & Lazier, 1996). Zooplankton, such as copepods, take longer to respond to the abundance of food available because they have life cycles of weeks rather than days. Zooplankton in the Canary Current reach their peak density in autumn when upwelling intensity decreases. The decrease in upwelling allows the zooplankton to stay over the shelf where their food supply exists. Due to the rapid response of phytoplankton to upwelled nutrients, zooplankton are seldom food-limited. =Upwelling and fish= Four types of fish comprise 75% of total catch in the Cap Blanc region (Mann & Lazier, 1996). Clupeids (Sardina pilchardus, the sardine, and Sardinella aurita) were the most abundant. S. pilchards dominate in the cooler northern waters while S. aurita are prevalent in warmer southern waters. Next most abundant were Jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and Redfish (Sparidae). Ansa-Emmin (1982) found that in 1974, the total fish landings reached 2.68 million tons. Nearly 1 million tons were Clupeidae with .67 million tons being sardines. Nutrient recycling Phytoplankton over the shelf area face two fates: They sink to the bottom or are consumed by zooplankton. If they settle to the bottom, phytoplankton release ammonia during their decomposition, which returns nitrogen to the waters. Consequently, the phytoplankton remains could be consumed by benthic dwellers, which also excrete ammonia. If consumed by zooplankton, nitrogen from the phytoplankton will be returned to the environment via excreted ammonia or fecal pellets, which settle to the bottom. Regardless of the mechanism, a high proportion of phytoplankton nitrogen ends up being released in the shoreward- moving lower layer of the water column (Mann & Lazier, 1996). This water will later be upwelled and can stimulate further primary production. Barber and Smith (1981) estimated that on the shelf off Cap Blanc, regenerated nitrogen accounted for 72% of total nitrogen.

Early life Abbott was born in Ithaca, New York to Syrian Christian refugees fleeing Turkish persecution in Syria. He enrolled in Cornell University to study architecture but dropped out a few credits short of his degree to organize farmers and the unemployed in Buffalo, New York and Niagara, New York during the Great Depression. In 1938, he met his wife, Ruth, in a Buffalo jail when she came to visit her father, a bricklayer and union activist, who had been arrested with Abbott. Together, they moved to Washington, D.C. in 1940, and Abbott and his father-in-law built a house in Takoma Park. When the United States entered World War II, Abbott enlisted in the Army Air Corps, serving in the European Theater and earning a Bronze Star. Post-war activism In the 1950s he actively campaigned for the adoption of the Bertrand Russell peace petition. He described himself as a Marxist, and in 1954, he was accused of being a member of the Communist party and called to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. After his testimony, he was fired from his job as a commercial artist, turning to freelance work. In the 1960s and 1970s, Abbott was one of the leaders of the Emergency Committee on the Transportation Crisis (ECTC), organizing the opposition to the construction of the North Central Freeway through Northeast Washington and Takoma Park, using the slogan, \\"No white men's roads through black men's homes.\\" He was also part of a group of local residents who organized against construction projects threatening Takoma Park. Alt URL In 1978, Abbott helped to organize the first Takoma Park Folk Festival to raise money to save the Takoma Theater. Mayor of Takoma Park Abbott ran for mayor of Takoma Park in 1978, but lost by just 8 votes. He won the office in 1980, and was re-elected in 1982 and 1984. As mayor, he oversaw the institution of rent control, installed speed bumps and four-way stops to slow traffic, and he successfully blocked the closing of public schools in Takoma Park. During his tenure, Takoma Park declared itself a Nuclear-free zone and a sanctuary for Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees. Abbott declared Takoma Park \\"Tree City, USA,\\" and the city, which had been known as \\"Tacky Park,\\" acquired the nickname of the \\"People's Republic of Takoma.\\" In his bid for a fourth term in 1985, Abbott lost by just seven votes. Death and legacy Abbott died of myelodysplasia anemia on December 15, 1990, at his Takoma Park home. The Takoma Park City Council passed a resolution lowering the city flag to half-mast, and the Montgomery County Council declared January 5, 1991, Sammie Abbott Day. Hundreds attended a memorial service that was held at the Washington Ethical Society. In 1991, Takoma Park added the name \\"Sam Abbott Citizens' Center\\" to its municipal building. In 2002, Abbott was inducted into the Montgomery County Human Rights Hall of Fame. In 2015, a plaque was dedicated for Abbott in the Citizens' Center. The plaque recognizes Abbott's contributions to Takoma Park and concludes with a quote from him: \\"If we can't make it happen in Takoma Park, there's no hope for the nation.\\" Abbott's wife, Ruth, died in 2009, and they are survived by their children Nancy Abbott Young, Susan Abbott, and Abraham Abbott.

Travis began his broadcasting career on the pirate radio station Radio Caroline in 1965. He moved to BBC Radio 1 where he became one of the station's leading presenters during the 1970s and 1980s, and a regular presenter of Top of the Pops. Following his resignation from the BBC in 1993, he worked for several British commercial radio stations. In November 2012, Travis was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree on suspicion of historic sexual offences, which he denied. In February 2014, he was found not guilty on twelve of the counts, with the jury unable to reach a decision on a further two counts. Travis faced a retrial on the two outstanding counts; with an additional alleged offence from 1995. The retrial began on 5 September 2014. On 23 September he was found guilty by a majority verdict of one count of indecent assault and on 26 September given a three-month prison sentence suspended for two years. Early life and career Born in Buxton, Derbyshire, Travis was raised in Manchester. His father was a stage manager and he attended Manchester Central Grammar School for Boys. Travis's first jobs were as a graphic designer, a designer of shop interiors and a photographer. At night and weekends he began working as a DJ at the Oasis Club in Manchester, making use of a Dansette autochanger. Giving up his other jobs, he went on a self-created and promoted UK tour of clubs, ballrooms and theatres presenting his own DJ shows. Consequently, he was asked by Herman's Hermits to become the tour manager and warm-up DJ on their next tour of the United States, supporting Bobby Vee and Freddy Cannon. On his return to the UK, Travis returned to the north of England and continued to promote his own shows in Blackpool, Bury and the surrounding areas. Radio =Radio Caroline= In September 1965, Travis started work at the offshore pirate radio station Radio Caroline South from the MV Mi Amigo off the Essex coast, later moving onto Radio Caroline North from the MV Fredericia off the Isle of Man until mid- August 1967. From spring 1966 until early 1969 he co-presented the monthly Beat-Club pop programme, on television in Germany together with Uschi Nerke. =BBC Radio 1= In 1967, offshore pirate radio was outlawed by the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act. Travis returned to Manchester to present the daily radio show Pop North on Radio 1 in 1968, and hosted Saturday afternoon programmes in the 4 to 5:30pm slot. In 1969, he took over a Sunday morning show from 10am to midday. In 1971, he was promoted to the weekday lunchtime show from 11am to 1pm, moving back to Sunday mornings in 1973 and also presenting the Radio 1 Club on Thursdays from 5 to 7pm. He also presented the Sunday afternoon request show between 3 and 5pm. In 1976, Travis took over the weekday teatime slot, 4:305:45pm (extended to run 4:307pm in 1977). He then took over The Radio 1 Breakfast Show from Noel Edmonds in May 1978 and continued in this slot until December 1980. He nicknamed himself \\"the Hairy Cornflake\\" during his time as the Radio 1 Breakfast Show host. In 1976, an on- air parody of C W McCall's US hit Convoy led to a release of the song Convoy GB as a single, recorded with fellow DJ Paul Burnett under the name Laurie Lingo and the Dipsticks. The song reached number four in the UK singles chart and Travis appeared as the song's narrator \\"Super Scouse\\" on Top of the Pops. In January 1981, Travis moved to weekday afternoons from 2:30 to 4:30pm. Later that year he moved back to the weekday lunchtime slot from 11:30am to 2pm, before moving to a Saturday morning show in 1983 from 10am to 1pm, then Sunday mornings from 10am to 1pm in 1987, taking over both Saturday and Sunday in September 1988. =On-air resignation= On 8 August 1993, Travis resigned on- air during his Sunday morning show, stating that he could not agree with changes that were being made to Radio 1. Travis told his audience that changes were afoot that he could not tolerate \\"and I really want to put the record straight at this point and I thought you ought to know ‚Äì changes are being made here which go against my principles and I just cannot agree with them\\". =A Jolly Good Show= From 1981 to 2001, Travis presented the BBC World Service music request programme A Jolly Good Show, having taken over from Noel Edmonds. In June 2011, Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi said the programme had given her a lifeline. The Nobel Peace Prize winner, who had spent 15 years under house arrest from 1989, told the BBC that A Jolly Good Show had made her \\"world much more complete\\". Travis said he was \\"touched\\" but \\"not surprised\\" that she had remembered it. =Since 1993= On leaving Radio 1, Travis hosted a networked Sunday morning show (10am1pm) across some of the UK's commercial radio stations. He also went to Classic Gold where he hosted the 10am1pm morning show (later 9amnoon), before moving to breakfast 7am9am and then back to mornings 9am11am. In 2002, Travis left Classic Gold to work for the British Army's Garrison FM. From March 2003 to March 2007, Travis returned to the BBC, and presented a Sunday morning show from 9am to noon on BBC Three Counties Radio, his local BBC radio station. Travis is a member of the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. Travis worked at the Magic Network from July 2006 until 2012. Following his arrest on sexual assault allegations, the station suspended him and did not renew his contract. Travis returned to the radio in April 2018 presenting a Saturday show on United DJs Radio. He left in September 2018 due to back pain but returned on 29 February 2020. Television Travis presented the German TV show Beat-Club, where he introduced such acts as Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Steamhammer. On BBC television, Travis presented editions of Top of the Pops in the 1970s and 1980s. He was also the presenter of The Golden Oldie Picture Show in the mid-1980s, an attempt by the BBC to create videos for classic pop songs that pre-dated the video age. Travis provided the UK commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest 1971 in Dublin, Ireland, and in 1985 presented the Eurovision Song Contest Previews on BBC1. On 14 February 2000, Travis was the subject of the This Is Your Life programme on British TV. In 2007, Travis appeared in the video for the Comic Relief version of the Proclaimers song \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\", performed by Peter Kay and Matt Lucas. Other TV appearances include The Weakest Link, Noel's House Party, Mrs. Merton, Stars Reunited, Kick Start, Dave's Lee's and Travis's and Today with Des and Mel. Sexual assault allegations In October 2012, two former BBC employees alleged that Travis had sexually assaulted several women during his time at the BBC. One of the women, who was 17 at the time, claimed in the media after making a formal statement to police that Travis put his hand up her skirt in 1977. The other, presenter Vivien Creegor, claimed Travis \\"jiggled her breasts\\" when she was live on BBC Radio 4 in the 1980s. On 15 November 2012, Travis was arrested at his home by the Metropolitan Police as part of the Operation Yewtree inquiry. He was the fourth person to be arrested as part of the investigation. In October 2013, Travis was charged (pleading not guilty) with 14 allegations of indecent assault and one of sexual assault between 1976 and 2008, relating to 11 female complainants aged between 15 and 29 at the time of the alleged offences. The trial began in January 2014 at Southwark Crown Court. On 13 February, Travis was found not guilty on twelve counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on the remaining two counts. Following the verdict, Travis told reporters \\"I do not feel like there is a victory in any way, shape or form. On the contrary, I think you already know that I have been through a year and a half of hell on this.\\" On 24 February, it was reported that the prosecution was seeking a retrial on the two outstanding counts. On 28 March 2014, it was reported that Travis would face another charge of indecent assault as well as the retrial on the two outstanding counts. On 15 April, it was reported that he was facing another charge of indecent assault on a woman aged over 16 in 1995. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 24 April, when he denied the charges. His trial began on 5 September at Southwark Crown Court. On 23 September, Travis was found guilty by a majority verdict of 10‚Äì2 of indecently assaulting a female researcher working on the Mrs Merton Show in 1995. He was found not guilty of indecently assaulting another woman while he was appearing in a production of Aladdin in 1990. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a third charge from 2008, involving a journalist who visited his home. On Friday 26 September 2014, he was sentenced to three months in prison, suspended for two years. The Attorney General's office rejected four complaints that the sentence was too lenient. On 8 December 2015, the Court of Appeal rejected Travis's bid to overturn his conviction. Personal life Travis lives in Buckland, Buckinghamshire, with his wife Marianne, whom he married in 1971. His interests include photography and classic cars. In 1987, he published a book of his photographs of well-known women, called A Bit of a Star, which he dedicated to his late father. In the 1970s, Travis was a regular drag racer.

Breema and Self-Breema exercises express the Nine Principles of Harmony upon which they are based. These principles claim to be distilled from the universal laws that govern life, and consequently, the body, its health, and its relationship to the energetic and physical aspects of the universe. The philosophy of Breema is derived from these same laws. Students of Breema learn health enhancing exercises and sequences that support mind-body connection and experiential understanding of the discipline's underlying nine principles of harmony: Body Comfortable; No Extra; Firmness and Gentleness; Full Participation; Mutual Support; No Judgment; Single Moment/Single Activity; No Hurry/No Pause and No Force. Movements embody these principles, and are meant to carry over into the practitioner's life outside of Breema.  Origin  The Breema Center was founded by Jon Schreiber, D.C, and a core group of individuals. Dr. Jon Schreiber studied extensively with Malouchek Mooshan and founded the Breema Center (in Oakland, California) in 1980. Today this bodywork system, with its practical tools for becoming more present and available to life, is taught worldwide.  Breema Bodywork and Self-Breema Exercises  Based on a profound yet practical understanding of the unifying principle of all life, Breema includes Self-Breema exercises as well as Breema bodywork, an extensive collection of treatment sequences through which practitioner and recipient can actualize physical, mental, and emotional balance and harmony. Breema bodywork employs nurturing, tension- relieving stretches and movements to create physical, mental, and emotional balance, in an atmosphere of harmony and non-judgment. Self-Breema refers to a vast repertoire of exercises that are a part of the comprehensive system of Breema. Each bodywork sequence and Self-Breema exercise is a perfect expression of the Nine Principles of Harmony, including the form of the treatment, its atmosphere, the practitioner-recipient dynamic, the practitioner's quality of touch, and the purpose and effect of the treatment or exercise. The philosophy and principles of Breema address the essential nature of life, the deeper meaning of health and how to actualize it, and the means of gaining practical, self-verified knowledge that can lead to an understanding of our unique potential as human beings.  Nine Principles of Harmony  Underlying Breema bodywork and Self-Breema exercises are Nine Principles of Harmony: * Body Comfortable * No Force * No Judgment * Mutual Support * Single Moment/Single Activity * No Extra * Firmness and Gentleness * No Hurry/No Pause * Full Participation  Training & Certification  The Breema Center in Oakland is the world headquarters for training and certifying instructors and practitioners. It offers a 165-hour practitioner certificate program in Breema bodywork. The required hours include a series of classes that lead to proficiency in a wide variety of sequences and Self-Breema exercises, along with a thorough knowledge of Breema principles. The Breema Center is approved to offer continuing education for massage practitioners and bodyworkers by the NCBTMB (#145251-00), registered nurses by the California BRN (#03852), and LMFTs, LCSWs, LPCCs, and LEPs by the CAMFT (#128568). Breema practitioners and instructors are available worldwide. The Breema Center maintains an up-to-date website that lists their contact information, as well as classes, workshops and events.

It was established as a small village controlled by a Health Committee in 1886 with the discovery of an outcrop of a gold reef on the farm Langlaagte. The population of the city grew rapidly, becoming a municipality in 1897. In 1928 it became a city making Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. In 2002 it joined ten other municipalities to form the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Today, it is a centre for learning and entertainment for all of South Africa. It is also the capital city of Gauteng. Prehistoric Era The region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by San people. They were hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago.See http://mk.org.za/mkhist1.htm By the 13th century, groups of Bantu-speaking people started moving southwards from central Africa and encroached on the indigenous San population. Stone-walled ruins of Sotho‚ÄìTswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated. Many of these sites contain the ruins of Sotho‚ÄìTswana mines and iron smelting furnaces, suggesting that the area was being exploited for its mineral wealth before the arrival of Europeans or the discovery of gold. The most prominent site within Johannesburg is Melville Koppies, which contains an iron smelting furnace.Mason, Revil, Origins of Black People of Johannesburg and the Southern Western Central Transvaal, AD 300-1880, Occasional Paper No. 16 of the Archeological Research Unit (University of the Witwatersrand), 1986. Republican Era =European Settlement and gold mining= Main Reef outcrop on original farms 1886. After the Great Trek European pastoralists also started settling in the Transvaal. Some of them chose to farm where Johannesburg was to rise later. Each burgher (citizen) was entitled to at least one farm, measuring 1500 morgen or about 3100 acres. The first recorded discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand was made by Jan Gerrit Bantjes in June 1884, on the farm Vogelstruisfontein. Other farms to become famous later included Langlaagte, Turffontein, Doornfontein and Braamfontein. George Harrison is today credited as the man who discovered an outcrop of the Main Reef of gold on the farm Langlaagte in February 1886.MJ Viljoen & WU Reimold, An Introduction to South Africa's Geological and Mining Heritage, Mintek, Randburg, 1999, p. 33. On 12 May 1886 Harrison and his partner, George Walker, entered into a prospecting agreement with the owner of Langlaagte, one G.C. Oosthuizen. Two days later Colonel Ignatius Ferreira staked out his camp on Turffontein to serve as a centre for diggers.Viljoen & Reimold, supra, p. 33. Louwrens Geldenhuys found the Main Reef on Turffontein and Henry Nourse located it on Doornfontein. On 8 September 1886 nine farms, extending from Driefontein in the east to Roodepoort in the west, were declared public diggingsViljoen & Reimold, supra, p. 34. Carl von Brandis was appointed as the mining commissioner for the area. On 8 November 1886 a diggers' committee was elected to assist the mining commissioner in the execution of his duties.John R Shorten, Die verhaal van Johannesburg, Voortrekkerpers, Johannesburg, 1970, p. 94, to be quoted later as Shorten(1). Nineteenth century stamp battery to crush ore. The earliest mining activities were concentrated along and adjacent to the outcrops of the main reef. Initially the diggers could perform the work themselves, using relatively little equipment. As the pits grew deeper, they needed additional labourers and machinery. Black Africans were recruited to perform the unskilled work. Machinery had to be imported from Europe and fuel had to be found to power the machinery.Viljoen & Reimold, supra, p.35 The discovery of coal on the far east Rand at Springs and Boksburg, as well as the construction of the Rand Steam Tram from the colliery to the gold fields and into Johannesburg facilitated the growth of the industry in its early years.Diana Cammack, The Rand at War, University of Natal Press, Pietersmaritzburg, 1990, p. 2. Soon, too, the railway arrived from the coast: in September 1892 the Cape railway reached the Rand. Two years later the line from Louren√ßo Marques (now Maputo) arrived in the Republic and a third route was opened from Durban the next year.Cammack, supra, p. 46. In 1890 the MacArthur-Forrest cyanidation process successfully overcame the problems of treating the refractory ore from deeper levels.Viljoen & Reimold, supra, p. 35. It soon became apparent that individual diggers were not equal to the task of mining gold in Johannesburg. Wealth could only be recovered by means of deep-shaft working and by capital- intensive companies having the necessary technical skills.Trewhella Cameron (general editor), An Illustrated History of South Africa, Jonathan Ball Publishers, Johannesburg, 1986, p. 184. Individual claims were soon joined into small mining groups. The amalgamation of smaller mining groups became a common occurrence and by 1895 the scene was dominated by a limited number of large monopolistic companies. These companies were: the Wernher-Beit-Eckstein group, Consolidated Goldfields, the J B Robinson group, the S. Neumann group, the Albu group, the A Goerz group, the Anglo-French group and the Lewis-Marks group. Of these, Cecil John Rhodes's Consolidated Goldfields was the most important.Cameron, supra, p. 185. Johannesburg stock exchange in 1893. In 1893 Johannesburg's first stock exchange was opened. From then until today Johannesburg has been the seat of the South African stock exchange and the country's financial heartland. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is presently in Sandton, Johannesburg. The Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic became the single biggest gold producer in the world, with a contribution of 27,5 percent in 1898.Cameron, supra, p. 184. =Founding of a city= The fledgling town of Johannesburg was laid out on a triangular wedge of \\"uitvalgrond\\" (area excluded when the farms were surveyed) named Randjeslaagte, situated between the farms Doornfontein to the east, Braamfontein to the west and Turffontein to the south. The property belonged to the government. The Surveyor-General of the ZAR issued an instruction that the farm be surveyed as a township, consisting of 600 stands measuring fifty feet by fifty feet. The first auction of stands took place on 8 December 1886.E.L.P. Stals (editor), Afrikaners in die Goudstad, Hollandsche Afrikaansche Uitgevers Mpy, Pretoria, 1978, The settlement was named after two officials of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR), Christiaan Johannes Joubert and Johannes Rissik,http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&id;=275&Itemid;=51 who both worked in land surveying and mapping. The two men combined the name they shared, adding 'burg', the archaic Afrikaans word for 'fortified city'. Early in 1887 the inhabitants started petitioning the government to proclaim a town council for the area. Eventually in November 1887 a proclamation was issued instituting a health committee. Its area was defined as \\"the place Johannesburg, including the stands known as Marshall Town and Ferreira's Town\\".Shorten(1), supra, p. 156 The committee's authority extended for a radius of three miles from the market square.Elizabeth Ann Cripps, Provisioning Johannesburg 1886‚Äì1906, M.A.-dissertation, Unisa, 2012, p. 9 The mining commissioner and the district surgeon were to be ex-officio members of the committee. The area of the committee's jurisdiction was to be divided into five wards. Each ward could elect one committee member. All adult male inhabitants had the vote. In 1890 six wards were proclaimed, each ward being entitled to elect two committee members.Stals, supra, p. 114. It was only in 1897 that the government approved, in terms of Act 9 of 1897, a town council for Johannesburg. In terms of the Act the area was divided into 12 wards. Each ward could elect two town councillors, one of which had to be a citizen of the ZAR.Shorten(1), supra, p. 206 The Rissik Street Post Office was built in 1897.The Rissik Street Post Office was built in 1897, having been designed by the architect Sytze Wierda. The Post Office was at one time the tallest building in Johannesburg. The Post Office became a national monument in 1978, and it remained in operation until 1996 when the South African Post Office vacated the building. The monument was gutted by a fire in 2009. The old City Hall is opposite the Post Office in Rissik Street. =Gold rush= Within ten years of the discovery of gold in Johannesburg, 100 000 people flocked to this part of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic in search of riches. Colonials, escaping the boredom of small-town life, joined Indians trekking from the sugar fields of Natal. Cape Coloureds and Chinese shopkeepers mixed with Africans, eager to experience the fast pace of urban life. Artisans and miners from the gold and silver fields of the Americas and Australia, from coal and tin mines of Europe, joined the wagon loads of men who had learnt their craft in the pits of Kimberley. Jews in search of freedom and employment, headed south to Africa from Eastern Europe and Russia. Mine managers and businessmen, solicitors and engineers, men with skills, education and contacts, confident of their expertise and frequently arrogant in their manner, took up positions in the burgeoning city of Johannesburg and in the new mines along the reef. In addition there were the pimps and adventurers, crooks and philanderers.Diana Cammack, The Rand at War, University of Natal Press, 1990, p. 1, quoting Butler, W.F., Sir William Butler: an autobiography, Constable & Co. Ltd, London, 1911. Johannesburg around 1890. In January 1890 the Health Committee conducted its first census of the town. They found that Johannesburg had 26 303 inhabitants. There were 13 820 buildings, of which 772 were shops and stores and 261 hotels and bars. The following suburbs were recorded: Booysens, Fordsburg, Langlaagte, Braamfontein, Auckland Park, Marshall's Town, Ferreira's Town, Prospect and Jeppe's Town. There was also a Coolie Location and a Veldtschoendorp, the latter being a shanty town occupied by Dutch citizens of the ZAR.Cripps, supra, p.173 Another census was conducted in January 1896. It was recorded that Johannesburg then had 102 078 inhabitants, of whom 61 292 lived within the three mile radius of Market Square and 40 786 outside. There were 50 907 Europeans or Whites, 952 Malays, 4 807 Asiatics, 2 879 mixed or other races and 42 533 Natives of whom 14 195 lived within the three mile radius and 28 838 outside. Of the 24 489 Whites born in Europe, 12 389 were from England and Wales, 997 from Ireland and 2 879 from Scotland. Of the 24 500 Europeans born in Africa, 6 205 were born in the Transvaal and 15 162 in the Cape Colony. New suburbs included: Klipfontein, Forest Town, Hillbrow, Berea, Yeoville, Bellevue, Houghton, Vrededorp, Paarl's Hoop, Robinson, Ophirton, La Rochelle, Rosettenville, Klipriviersberg, City & Suburban, Doornfontein, Bertrams, Lorentzville and Troyeville. It was also recorded that there was a Malay Camp, Brickfields, a Coolie Location and a Kafir Location.Cripps, supra, p. 174-6 Kliptown is the oldest Black residential district of Johannesburg and was first laid out in 1891 on land which formed part of Klipspruit farm. =Society= From the start the city segregated itself spatially in terms of class and, to a lesser extent, race. Julius Jeppe and his partner, Lewis Peter Ford, bought a portion of the farm Turffontein. They had two townships surveyed and called them Fordsburg and Jeppestown. Both were next to the mines along the Main Reef. The stands in Fordsburg were auctioned is May 1887, but the prices were very low because the soil was marshy. The result was that white working-class families settled in Jeppestown and in Fordsburg factories, bars and \\"kafir-eating houses\\" sprang up.Stals, supra, p. 45. Just north of Jeppestown is Doornfontein, then known as a 'classy' suburb, where professional and commercial men lived. Many Jews lived there as well.Cammack, supra, p. 9. Their children attended school. The first English language school in Johannesburg was started by the Holy Family Sisters. In 1887 they opened a school in Fox Street, but it grew so fast that they had to move to bigger premises in End Street, next to Doornfontein.Felix Stark, Seventy Golden Years, 1886-1956, Municipal Public Relations Bureau, 1956, p. 430; http://www.stcschool.co.za/index.php/info/history . To the west of Doornfontein was Braamfontein, where white wage earners with families and single white men lived. In October 1887 the government of the ZAR bought the south-eastern portion of the farm Braamfontein. Quite a big stream flowed along the farm and they intended selling the water to the residents of Johannesburg. But there were also large quantities of clay, suitable for brickmaking, along the stream. The government decided that more money was to be made from issuing brick maker's licences at five shillings per month.Stals, supra, p. 51 The result was that many landless Dutch-speaking burghers (citizens) of the ZAR settled on the property and started making bricks. They also erected their shacks there. Soon the area was known either as Brickfields or Veldschoendorp.Stals, supra, p. 52. Soon other working poor, \\"Malays, Coolies and Kaffirs\\" also settled there. The government, who sought to differentiate the white working class from the black, laid out new suburbs for the Burghers, Indians, Coloureds and Africans, but the whole area simply stayed multiracial. The railway line and goods yards were just north of these slum areas. On 19 February 1896 there was a great dynamite explosion in the railway goods yard at Braamfontein. 55 tons of dynamite had been left in the blazing sun and was detonated by the impact of a shunting engine. The explosion left a crater 250 feet long, 60 feet wide and 30 feet deep. At least 78 people were killed and 1500 injured.John R Shorten, The Saga of Johannesburg, John R Shorten (Pty) Limited, 1970, p. 198. The government made another effort to separate the burghers from the non-whites by allowing them to become tenants in the newer suburb called Vrededorp. The suburbs was opened to white who could acquire the stands on leasehold for a mere two shillings and sixpence a month. Many whites took up the offer and then sublet the stands to Indians for five shillings a month. On the mines living conditions were harsh and alienating, particularly for the Africans who lived in large compounds. They were placed in bunk houses, which were overcrowded and cold in winter, where food was tedious and not abundant and where pulmonary disease was rife. White miners lived differently, though not in overwhelming comfort. Hohenheim was the first of the Parktown mansions when completed in 1894.The View Meanwhile, at the northern extremity of the town was Parktown, already known for its exclusivity and extreme wealth. Sir Lionel Phillips was the first Randlord to build a mansion in Parktown. \\"Hohenheim\\" was built in 1894 and demolished in 1972 to make way for the Johannesburg Academic Hospital. Sunny Side Park was designed by Frank Emley for Hennen Jennings and completed in 1896. Today it is part of the Sunny Side Park Hotel. \\"The View\\" was completed in 1897. It was built by Charles Aburrow as the residence of Sir Thomas Cullinan. =Franchise= The law of the land provided that every White (European) male who had resided in the Transvaal for five years, could be naturalized and become entitled to vote for a representative in the Volksraad (house of assembly).Cameron, supra, p. 189. As more and more foreigners (called Uitlanders) arrived in the country to dig for gold, the government realized as early as 1890 that these Uitlanders could easily gain control of the country. The solution was to create a Second Volksraad. Uitlanders who had been naturalized for two years were granted the right to vote for candidates for the Second Volksraad. The Second Volksraad only had a say in regard to specific matters relating to Johannesburg and the mines. The bills of this body only became law after ratification by the First Volksraad. The residential qualification enabling Uitlanders to vote for the First Volksraad was extended from five to fourteen years and the voting age increased to forty years. Only a small number of Uitlanders took the trouble to register as voters for the Second Volksraad. Uitlander dissatisfaction persisted. Some of their main complaints were nepotism and corruption of officials. What upset them most was that the prices and quality of essential goods for the mining industry were adversely affected by the government's system of concessions. These included the supply of water to Johannesburg, the manufacture and distribution of liquor and dynamite and the construction of railway lines.Cameron, supra, p. 186 Then too the republican machinery of state was primarily geared to meeting the needs of a pastoral-agricultural community and it did not have the skills to administer a rapidly growing industrial state.Cameron, supra, p. 186. The time was ripe for rebellion. In Johannesburg a Reform Committee was formed, while Cecil John Rhodes, the prime minister of the Cape Colony, arranged for Leander Starr Jameson to invade the republic from the west. The Jameson Raid was a failure and all the culprits were arrested.Cameron, supra, p. 190-1 Rhodes had to resign as prime minister. Afterwards the British Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, took up the cause of the Uitlanders in their fight for the franchise. He appointed fellow- imperialist, Alfred Milner, as British Commissioner in South Africa.Cameron, supra, p. 194. No settlement could be reached and eventually, on 11 October 1899, war broke out between Great Britain and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek.Cameron, supra, p. 197. Second Boer War =Up to 31 May 1900= Flight By May 1899 it began to look as though war was a real possibility. First to leave were the wives and children of middle and upper- class families. By June white miners joined the flight. Shop assistants and others in the urban economy were notified by their employers that their services would not be required after the end of the month. Between May and mid-October nearly 100,000 white people fled the district. Thus, at the onset of war, there were only about 10,000 whites in the city.Cammack, supra, pp. 38-41. The task of transporting this number of people ‚Äî as well as the more than 100,000 non-whites who left ‚Äî was an enormous one. At first only third- class passengers were consigned to trucks which normally carried coal, livestock or Africans. By the middle of October even first class passengers were quite happy to travel in coal trucks to the coast.Cammack, supra, p. 42. John Sidney Marwick was a civil servant in the employ of the Department of the Secretary for Native Affairs in the colony of Natal. In 1896 he was transferred to Johannesburg and appointed as Native Agent for Zululand. He was only twenty years old.Elsab√© Brink, 1899 The Long March Home, Kwela Books, 1999 (), p. 43. His function was to look after the Zulu men working in the mines on the Witwatersrand. In 1897 alone, 20,615 Zulus from Zululand and Natal had registered at the pass office in Johannesburg.Brink, supra, p. 45-6. By the end of September 1899 some 5,000 Zulus were stranded in Johannesburg and Marwick obtained permission for them to walk back to Natal.Brink, supra, p. 61. They were to walk to the border at Volksrust, some 150 miles from Johannesburg. The march started on 6 October. On 11 October they reached the town of Standerton, where Marwick learnt that the Boers had delivered an ultimatum to the British and it would expire at five o'clock that afternoon. The Boer commandos, numbering some 8,000 men, had been assembling at Sandspruit on the road between Standerton and Volksrust.Brink, supra, p. 78. Marwick rode ahead to see General Joubert at Sandspruit, but found that the Boer forces had advanced to Volksrust. On 12 October the Zulus marched to within three miles of Sandspruit.Brink, supra, p. 80. That night a heavy downpour of rain came on. A large number of natives were suffering severely from exposure. The next day they reached Volksrust. They saluted General Joubert as they marched past him and then crossed the border into Natal.Brink, supra, p. 83. Unfortunately there were no trains available and the Zulus landed up behind some Boer commandos invading Natal. Marwick and his Zulus were eventually allowed through and they reached Newcastle on 14 October 1899, when the long march home ended. Some walked to Zululand, while others boarded trains for Durban.Brink, supra, p. 87. See too Cammack, supra, pp. 51-2 Closing of mines On 4 September 1899 the state attorney, Jan Smuts, wrote to the government that the mines would be of the utmost importance in the event of war. They would be a vital source of money if they could be kept open. To guarantee their operation, supplies of material and men had to be maintained and this, in turn, meant that whole staffs, even if British, had to be encouraged to stay. The government responded by reintroducing the Gold Law (Law 15 of 1898). It provided that after martial law had been declared, if a mine ceased operations, the government could order it to reopen and, if it did not comply, it could take over the operation itself. The government would then be entitled to use any gold thus won for its own benefit. The government would be obliged to return the mine to its owner upon repeal of martial law, provided that the owners had not been found guilty of high treason. Over the weekend of 30 September many of the well-known mines closed, including Simmer & Jack, Wolhuter, Geldenhuis Deep, Henry Nourse and Ferreira. Robinson Deep closed on 3 October. By that time all the Consolidated Gold Fields mines had closed. On 7 October the government listed 66 major mines closed, with only 17 having applied to continue operations.Cammack, supra, p. 48. Some mines offered bonuses to white workers if they remained.Cammack, supra, p. 49. Some of the discharged Africans started rioting and looting. Thus blacks from Robinson Deep looted Chinese shops at Ophirton. On 8 October, at a 'puza' shop in the location near Vrededorp, shots were fired and shops looted.Cammack, supra, p. 50. Some of the foreigners were arrested and charged with treason, like the jingoist editor of the Transvaal Leader R.J.Pakeman.Cammack, supra, p. 53 Others joined the Boer forces, like John Y.F. Blake, an Irish-American, who commanded the First Irish Brigade. The Scandinavian corps, renowned for their bravery, was virtually wiped out at the battle of Magersfontein. Viscount Villebois-Mareuil formed a small French force.Cammack, supra, p. 55 Joburg under the Boers In late September the government appointed a Rust en Orde (Peace and Order) commission. It consisted of D.E. Schutte (the peacetime commissioner of police), Dr F.E.T. Krause (the head public prosecutor) J.L.van der Merwe (the mining commissioner) and N.P.van den Berg (the head landdrost [magistrate]).Cammack, supra, pp. 61-2 A new police force was established for the whole Witwatersrand. Its leader was Captain de Korte, a former officer in the Dutch army.Cammack, supra, p. 64. Johannesburg was relatively unaffected by the first eight months of the war. There were of course disrupted services, shortages and a certain amount of fear, tension and boredom.Cammack, supra, p. 78. By mid-October the government had taken over and begun to work three mines: the Robinson, the Bonanza and the Ferreira Deep. J.H.Munnik, the acting state mining engineer, was appointed manager of the Robinson mine. In November they added the Rose Deep as well. Several other mines were allowed to operate under their own management. These were Ferreira, Village Main Reef, the Wemmer, the Johannesburg Pioneer and the Worcester. Later Langlaagte Deep, Crown Deep, Geldenhuis Estate were added.Cammack, supra, p. 84. It is thought that between 12,000 and 13,000 blacks remained on the mines.Cammack, supra, p. 85 From 10 October to 30 April 1900 gold valued at an estimated ¬£1,710,549 was won from the mines. In May another ¬£240,000 was taken. Working expenses were put at about ¬£630,000 of which only two-thirds was paid. The profit accruing to the government was ¬£1,5 million, enough to cover war expenses up to that point in time.Cammack, supra, p. 89. Also of use to the Boers was Begbie's armaments factory. Thomas Begbie & Company, a foundry situated near the City and Suburban mine just south of Johannesburg, was commandeered by the government two days after the war had begun.Cammack, supra, p. 95 On 24 April 1900 there was a huge explosion at Begbie's factory. The critical question facing the authorities was whether it was an accident or sabotage. Several arrests were made, the suspicion being that it was the work of British agents, but nothing was proved. The carelessness of men filling shells or smoking cigarettes nearby, could not be excluded.Cammack, supra, p. 105. As a result of the explosion Schutte was removed as special commandant of the Witwatersrand and Dr Krause was appointed in his stead.Cammack, supra, p. 106. On 3 May 1900 Lord Roberts left Bloemfontein and resumed his march to Pretoria. In the Transvaal there was much talk about a conspiracy to destroy the gold mines before the British arrived. Munnik, the state mining engineer, and ex-judge Antonie Kock were certainly involved. British military intelligence thought Jan Smuts and F.W. Reitz were also involved.Cammack, supra, p. 101, and endnote 1 on p. 113. In mid-May Kock, at the head of a commando, arrived in Johannesburg with a letter from Reitz instructing him to destroy the mines. Krause refused him access to any mines.Cammack, supra, p. 107. On 29 May Krause arrested Kock and had him sent to Pretoria.Cammack, supra, p. 109. Plaque commemorating British occupation of Johannesburg Lord Roberts crossed the Vaal River on 29 May and reached Germiston on 30 May. On that morning his representatives entered the town to demand its surrender. Krause agreed to hand the town over the next day. On 31 May the British troops marched into Johannesburg. In front of the court house the Vierkleur was taken down and the Union Jack raised. The new military commissioner of police, Major Francis Davis, imposed a night curfew and closed all liquor stores. The British then had to figure out how to govern the Rand and its population of 13,000 blacks and an unknown number of whites who were probably hostile.Cammack, supra, p. 112. = After 31 May 1900 = One of the first steps taken by Lord Roberts was to declare an Imperial Government Municipality for Johannesburg. Colonel Colin MacKenzie was an appointed as its Military Governor. He had to deal with thousands of previous employees wanting to return to the Rand.Shorten(2), supra, p. 227. On 25 October 1900 the Transvaal was annexed.Thomas Pakenham,The Boer War, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1979, , P. 582. Lord Alfred Milner was appointed Administrator of the Transvaal in May 1901. He issued the Municipal Proclamation No.16 of 1901 whereby the town was granted a municipal council of 18 members, all nominated.Shorten(2), supra, p. 228 In December 1903 they were replaced by a wholly elected town council consisting of 30 councilors. Municipal boundaries were extended to embrace, within a six-mile radius of the central area, mining properties and all vacant land of which the suburbs of the town were likely to develop.Shorten(2), supra, pp.229-230. Proclamation 13 of 1902 extended the boundaries of the town's jurisdidiction to 79 square miles.Shorten(2), supra, 232 Granite plaque at Suideroord for 716 Turffontein concentration camp deaths Very little is known about the British concentration camp in Turffontein Johannesburg.See, for example, Cammack, supra, p. 191. It was apparently constructed on the site of the Turffontein Turf Club, which was started in 1887 and still exists at the same place. Those who died at the concentration camp were buried at a cemetery where the suburb Suideroord was laid out many years later. The location is 26¬∞16.357'S, 28¬∞01.638'E. The site still exists, but it is surrounded by palisade fencing and the gates are securely locked. The cemetery was vandalized at the beginning of the Second World War, with the result that the gravestones were replaced by a memorial. The memorial is in the shape of seven coffins. One marble slab, erected on 10 October 1957, records that it replaced a marble slab that had also been vandalized in March 1957. Another records that 716 persons who had died in the concentration camp, were buried in that cemetery. Johannesburg High CourtIn 1902 Lord Milner also issued a proclamation establishing two supreme courts in the Transvaal. The one intended to serve the Witwatersrand gold fields was initially called the Witwatersrand District Court.Proclamation 14 of 1902; See too 1902 (XIX) South African Law Journal 221 Later it was called the Transvaal High Court. Although the opening of the court was anticipated for 20 May 1902, the High Court building was only inaugurated in 1910.Advocate, April 2010, p. 49. The stained glass window above the court entrance contains the only remaining coat of arms of the Transvaal Colony. The court is situated in Pritchard Street, opposite Kruis Street. After Union in 1910, the court was called the Witwatersrand Local Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. At present (2016) it is called the South Gauteng High Court. The Colonial Transvaal Johannesburg gold fields and suburbs, 1902 In April 1904 there was a bubonic plague scare in the shanty town area of Brickfields. The town council decided to condemn the area and burn it down. Beforehand most of the Africans living there were moved far out of town to Klipspruit (later called Pimville), where the council had erected iron barracks and a few triangular hutments. The rest of them had to build their own shacks. No provision was made for the alternative accommodation of other racial groups. The fire brigade then set the 1600 shacks and shop, plus an Indian temple, in Brickfields alight. Out of this holocaust there emerged one rat that was promptly shot. Thereafter the area was redeveloped as Newtown where a new market was built.Shorten(2), supra, p. 240. Gandhi and staff in front of his office in 1905. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, a qualified English barrister, came to southern Africa in 1893 to act as legal representative of some Indian traders in Pretoria. He moved to Natal, where he was instrumental in forming the Natal Indian Congress. In 1902 he concerned himself with the rights of Indians in the Transvaal Colony.Cameron, supra, p. 222. He opened his own firm of attorneys (solicitors) in Johannesburg. In 1910 his supporters gave him the use of land to open an ashram, named Tolstoy Farm and dedicated to the ideas of the Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, outside Johannesburg, which was to become the centre of the next phase of satyagraha (nonviolent resistance).Cameron, supra, pp. 226 & 232. In 1913 Gandhi and 2,000 Indian men and women flouted the law and marched from Natal into the Transvaal. He was arrested and jailed. Eventually he reached agreement with General Smuts, resulting in the South African Parliament passing the Indian Relief Act of 1914. He regarded his work in South Africa as done and returned to India in 1915.Cameron, supra, p. 236. He acquired the honorific title Mahatma. Sophiatown was originally part of the farm Waterval. In 1897 the speculator Hermann Tobiansky acquired a 237-acre portion of the farm, which was situated about four miles or so west of the centre of Johannesburg. In 1903 he had some of the land surveyed as leasehold township, divided into almost 1700 small stands. The township was named after Tobiansky's wife, Sophia, and some of the streets were named after his children Toby, Gerty, Bertha and Victoria. Blacks started acquiring land in Sophiatown. Northwards, originally built in 1904 Eastington, a mansion on Harrow Road All the gold mines reopened and the Randlords returned to Johannesburg. The first mansion to be built was not in Parktown, but on the hill overlooking Doornfontein suburb. It was called \\"Eastington\\" and was built in 1902 for John Dowell Ellis. Soon they started building their Parktown mansions as well. One of the first to be built was \\"Northwards\\". It was designed by Herbert Baker and built at 21 Rockridge Road for Sir John and Lady Josie Dale Lace. When they fell on hard times it was taken over by George Albu. The present owner is the University of the Witwatersrand. The house was built by specialist craftsmen and masons rather than from manufactured parts which had become popular during the Industrial Revolution. The house possesses some beautiful romantic features like a minstrel gallery and Juliette balconies. Crown Mines Limited, which was founded in 1909 by the combination of seven mining properties, including the Robinson Mine and the Crown Mine, was for many years the biggest producer of gold in the world. It continued mining until 1977.Viljoen & Reimold, supra, p. 36. Rand Club, built in 1904. The Rand Club of Johannesburg is the oldest private members' club in Johannesburg, South Africa, and founded in October 1887. The plan for the current, third, clubhouse was put on paper in 1902 and its construction was finished in 1904 on the design by architects Leck & Emley in the Edwardian neo-baroque style. Lord Alfred Milner left South Africa on 2 April 1905 and was succeeded as High Commissioner by the Earl of Selbourne. In January 1906 the Liberal Party in the United Kingdom won the general election and decided to grant the Transvaal responsible government. An election was held in 1907 and General Louis Botha became the Prime Minister of the Transvaal.Cameron, supra, p. 225. The various religious organisations were also building their houses of worship. The synagogue was in President street, while the Baptist Church building was in Plein Street. The Central Congregational Church was in Bree Street.Shorten, supra, p.247. Standard Bank building in 1908 The Standard Bank building at the corner of Harrison and Commissioner Streets was completed in 1908. It was built in the Beaux Arts Style, then popular in fashionable areas of London. Among the public amenities provided by the town council in the first decade was the Ellis Park swimming pool, which opened in 1909.Shorten, supra, p. 254. The population of Johannesburg increased from 13,027 whites and 78,106 non-whites in 1904 to 24,708 whites and 189,912 non- whites in 1910. In the same period the value of gold produced increased from ¬£15 million to ¬£33 million.Shorten(2), supra, p. 248. In 1909 a National Convention was attended by the four self-governing British colonies in South Africa, namely Cape of Good Hope, Natal, Transvaal and Orange River, to consider closer cooperation. The result was that the British Parliament passed the South Africa Act, 19099 Edward VII, Chapter 9 and the said colonies became the Union of South Africa with effect from 31 May 1910.Cameron, supra, p. 226. Union of South Africa =Pre-1948= 1910 to 1919 Johannesburg and suburbs in 1912 The constitution of the Union of South Africa provided for a highly centralized Westminster-type union, modified by subservient provincial councils with limited powers. One of the powers delegated to provincial councils was control of municipal affairs.South Africa Act, 1909, 9 Edward VII, chapter 9, Part V, sections 68-94. In 1912 the Transvaal Provincial Council approved a number of ordinances to control local government institutions in the province. These included the Local Government Ordinance (no. 9 of 1912), the Local Authorities Rating Ordinance (no. 6 of 1912) and the Municipal Elections Ordinance (no. 8 of 1912). There was a portion of the quitrent farm \\"Cyferfontien\\" No. 2 in the District of Johannesburg, transferred to Gert Pieter Johannes Labuschagne by deed dated 31 March 1875. In 1905 the portion known as Alexandra was transferred to Alexandra Township Ltd., the name \\"Alexandra\\" being that of King Edward VII's wife. On the property a township was laid out consisting of 388 lots, 2 parks and a square, in addition to streets. It was intended for occupation by white persons, but the lots were not sold and in 1912 the township company decided that properties in the township, to use the elegant language of the deed of transfer, \\"shall not be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of excepting to a native or person of colour, provided that an Asiatic shall not be included in the terms 'native or person of colour'.\\" Although ordinarily an African could not purchase land outside certain scheduled areas, this prohibition did not apply in regard to a township established prior to the commencement of Act No 27 of 1913, and it was therefore lawful for Alexandra Township Ltd to sell lots to black persons. And thus black persons acquired the precious right of freehold title to land when they purchased lots in Alexandra Township. There were 2525 lots, nearly all of which had been sold in 1936 when the population in the area was about 16753.Jack Unterhalter,Q.C., The Dark City, Alexandra Township, Reality, Volume 10 No. 4, July 1978, pp. 11&12, found at While a limited amount working-class housing existed within Johannesburg, the number of workers wanting to live in the city far exceeded the housing that was available and actually preferred the more expensive slum-yards than the workers' compounds. Segregationist laws like the Natives' Land Act of 1913, which defined less than 10% of South Africa as black \\"reserves\\" and prohibited the sale or lease of land to blacks outside of the reserves, sought to restrict Africans from access to cities and effectively prevented Africans from land ownership throughout the country. However, the labor needs of Johannesburg's growing manufacturing sector, especially in the wake of World War I, when increased industrialization also increased the need for African labor, meant that the Johannesburg municipal government ignored national policy and allowed racial mixing in these growing urban slums to occur.Parnell, Susan. \\"Race, Power and Urban Control: Johannesburg's Inner City Slum-Yards, 1910-1923.\\" Journal of Southern African Studies 29, no. 3: 615-37. A municipal system of exemption certificates obtained through employers did exist to grant African workers the right to live in urban areas. However, disregard on the part of the employer's for filling out the paperwork meant that most Africans resided in the city illegally. Johannesburg City Hall, built in 1914Johannesburg Art Gallery, completed in 1915. Johannesburg City Hall was constructed in 1914 by the Hawkey and McKinley construction company. The plan for the building was drawn in 1910 and construction was started in 1913 and finished in 1914. The style is described as Edwardian Baroque with a portico of Ionic columns and tower with a half dome entrance described as neo-Renaissance. Florence Phillips, an art collector and the wife of mining magnate Lionel Phillips, established the first collection for the Johannesburg Art Gallery using funds donated by her husband. The architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, came to South Africa in 1910 to examine the site and begin the designs, after Lady Florence Phillips had secured funding from the city for a purpose-built museum. The gallery was possibly Luytens's first public building in the Beaux Arts style. It was built with a south-facing entrance, but was not completed according to the architect's designs. It was opened to the public, without ceremony, in 1915, just after the start of the First World War. In 1919 the municipality laid out another native location next to the Sophiatown township. It was called Western Native Township and was owned and controlled by the municipality.David Goodhew, Working-class Respectability, The Journal of African History, Volume 14 No. 2, pp. 241-266 1920 to 1929 At the end of 1921 the miners of the Witwatersrand went on strike. At one stage they occupied the Johannesburg suburbs of Fordsburg and Jeppe. The uprising was also known as the Rand Revolt. Central Block of Wits on East Campus On 1 March 1922, the University College, Johannesburg, was finally granted full university status after being incorporated as the University of the Witwatersrand. The Johannesburg municipality donated a site in Milner Park, north-west of Braamfontein, to the new institution as its campus and construction began the same year, on 4 October. In 1925, the Prince of Wales opened Central Block (which includes the Great Hall). The Rand Water Board Supplementary Water Supply (Private) Act was passed by the Union Parliament in June 1914. The measure gave the Board the right to impound annually sufficient of the Vaal River's surplus water to supply the Witwatersrand with 20 million gallons a day. A loan of ¬£1,250,000 was raised for the construction of the barrage below Vereeniging. It was only completed in 1923.Shorten(2), supra, p. 271. In 1926 the Transvaal Provincial Council repealed the Local Government Ordinance of 1912 and passed the new Local Government Ordinance, No. 11 of 1926.http://www.repository.up.ac.za/dspace/handle/2263/55941 The Transvaal Provincial Council adopted a Private Ordinance (No. 15 of 1928) in terms of which the Town of Johannesburg acquired the designation of the City of Johannesburg. The Town Council became known as the City Council of Johannesburg. In 1923 the Parliament of the Union of South Africa passed the Natives (Urban Areas) Act. This Act required local authorities to provide accommodation for Natives (then the polite term for Africans or Blacks) lawfully employed and resident within the area of their jurisdiction. Pursuant to this Act the Johannesburg town council formed a Municipal Native Affairs Department in 1927.It bought a large tract on the farm Klipspruit No. 8 and the first houses in what was to become Orlando Location were built there in the latter half of 1930.Stark, supra, p. 525. 1930 to 1939 City Library opened in 1935. Ansteys Building during the 1930s In 1935 the Johannesburg City Library eventually opened its doors to the public. The Ansteys Building at the corner of Jeppe and Joubert Streets was designed by Emley and William and completed in 1937. It is recognised as a prime example of Art Deco Architecture, a style synonymous with modernisation, optimism and Americanisation before World War 2. The departmental store, N. Anstey's and Company, occupied the first four floors of the building. The tea terrace was on the fourth floor and was a destination of choice for the ladies of the northern suburbs. The building is 20 storeys high and was, when it was completed, the highest building in the southern hemisphere. The remaining storeys were offices and apartments, some of them occupying an entire floor. The building terminates in a mast designed for docking air ships. In 1939 the Transvaal Provincial Council once again passed a brand new ordinance to control local governments in the Transvaal. It was called the Local Government Ordinance, 1939. 1940 to 1948 Baragwanath Hospital, 1942 In 1940 London asked Pretoria to provide hospitals for Imperial troops stationed in the Middle East. South African agreed to build one such hospital on the road between Johannesburg and Potchefstroom. The exact place was to be at the 8th milestone near the old Wayside Inn, owned by a Cornishman called John Albert Baragwanath. Construction started in November 1941 and within 6 months the first soldiers could be admitted in May 1942. Britain paid ¬£328,000 pounds for the 1,544-bed hospital. The facility was called the Imperial Military Hospital, Baragwanath. Towards the end of the war more and more tuberculosis patients were treated, some also coming from Burma. Those who died were buried at the new Westpark Cemetery near Emmarentia. King George VI visited the facility on 5 April 1947 and presented medals to some of the troops who were still patients there. Later, the Transvaal Provincial Administration bought the hospital for ¬£1 million. On 1 April 1948 the Black section of Johannesburg Hospital (known as Non-European Hospital or NEH) was transferred to Baragwanath Hospital.https://www.chrishanibaragwanathhospital.co.za/; http://www.joburg.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=297&Itemid;=51 From 1944 many more Natives started arriving in Johannesburg. Soon they started spilling out of Pimville and other parts of the western and eastern areas of Johannesburg, soon congregating on a site to the west of Orlando. At the beginning of 1947 the City Council started a new emergency camp called Moroko. They made 10,000 small sites available. Residents were expected to build their own makeshift shanties on cramped six metre by six metre plots and using communal bucket-system toilets. The emergency camp was only dismantled in 1955, when it housed 58,000 people.Philip Bonner & Lauren Segal, Soweto ‚Äî A History, Maskew Miller Longman, 1998, p. 27. =1948 to 1961= In 1948 the National Party won the general election and this was set to change the face of South African history for ever. The support the National Party gained from the electorate was largely the result of white fears regarding the rapid urbanisation of blacks after the Second World War. The Nats campaigned vigorously for racially segregated cities under a policy they called \\"apartheid\\". They imposed stricter pass laws which made it more difficult for black workers to travel to town,cleared black freehold townships and other areas of black settlement in the inner city and built 7,000 new houses in Johannesburg.Bonner & Segal, supra, p. 27-8. By 1956 the Johannesburg City Council had provided 26,134 black families with houses in the seven townships under its control. These were Orlando (14356 houses), Western Native Township (2,250), Eastern Native Township (617), Pimville (1,246), Jabavu (5,100), Dube (1,115) and Mofolo (1,450).Stark, supra, p. 525-7 But the housing backlog had climbed to 57,000.Bonner & Segal, supra, p. 27. The logjam was soon broken. The central government decided to rather let land to Africans so that they could erect their own houses on the Moroka Emergency Camp. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research designed a standard house for low cost housing. It was a 40-square-metre four roomed house. Then in 1951 it passed the BantuThe latest polite term for Blacks Building Workers Act, permitting Blacks to be trained as artisans in the building industry. It also passed the Bantu Services Levy Act in 1952, which imposed a levy on the employers of Africans and used the proceeds to pay for infrastructure in their townships.Bonner & Segal, supra, p.28. The Johannesburg City Council provided 10,000 serviced sites by the end of 1955. The next year the townships of Tladi, Zondi, Dhlamini, Chiawelo and Senoane were laid out to provide 28,888 people with accommodation. In 1957 Jabulani, Phiri and Naledi followed. By 1958 Moroka and all shelters in Orlando had been cleared. But formal housing was lagging behind and by 1954 only 3,000 had been provided. Then Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was invited to visit Moroka. Sir Ernest was aghast and he arranged with other mining companies to join Anglo-American in providing the city with a loan of ¬£3 million to be repaid over thirty years. Between 1954 and 1959 24,000 additional houses were built and 14,000 of them were financed by these loans.Bonner & Segal, supra, p. 29. The first Group Areas Act was promulgated on 7 July 1950, and it was implemented over a period of several years. The Act empowered the Governor-General to declare certain geographical areas to be for the exclusive occupation of specific racial groups. In particular the statute identified three such racial groups: whites, coloureds and natives. The Act permitted the removal of person from an area reserved for persons of a different racial group. This Act was repealed and re-enacted in consolidated form as the Group Areas Act, 1957. The townships of Meadowlands and Diepkloof were built by the central government. Between 1956 and the early 1960s 23,995 houses were built, particularly for those Blacks evicted from Sophiatown, Martindale, Newclare and Western Native Township in terms of the Group Areas Act. The Johannesburg City Council (controlled by the opposition United Party) would have nothing to do with the forced removals. So it was done by the government's Natives Resettlement Board. Subsequently, the Board administered those two townships.Grinker, infra, p.xi. Before 1948 the township of Dube was set aside as an area where wealthier Africans could obtain freehold title and build their own houses. The National Party put a stop to this and changed it to 30-year leaseholds. By 1954 African residents had built 2,500 houses from their own resources. The top-of-the-range houses cost around ¬£1,500 compared to the ¬£250 of the \\"matchbox\\" houses in other townships.Bonner & Segal, supra, p. 31. In 1959 Mr. Carr, the city council's manager of Non-European Affairs, launched a competition to find a new name for the council's showpiece of slum clearance. He offered a prize of ¬£10. After four years of hot arguments the naming committee decided to call it Soweto, an abbreviated version of South- Western Townships. The 1957 Alexandra bus boycott was a protest undertaken against the Public Utility Transport Corporation (PUTCO) by the people of Alexandra. The bus boycott lasted from January 1957 to June 1957. At its height, 70,000 township residents refused to ride the local buses to and from work. For many people this daily journey to downtown Johannesburg was a twenty-mile round trip. In the 1950s the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) decided to move its headquarters from the centre of town to Braamfontein. ESCOM acquired a whole block fronting on Smit, Harrison, Loveday and Wolmarans Streets, a site formerly occupied by a dairy. The cost of the site was ¬£261 220 and the building cost was ¬£1 854 620. The building was completed in 1958 and was 17 storeys high. It was called Eskom Centre.http://www.eskom.co.za/sites/heritage/Pages/ESCOMCENTRE.aspx Randburg was founded in 1959 as a new municipality of 32 suburbs northwest of Johannesburg. Although economically linked to Johannesburg, residents chose to create their own town council. The name Randburg was chosen in a competition, and is derived from the South African Rand currency, which was introduced at around the same time that the new municipality was established. Randburg was a stronghold of the National Party during the apartheid era. On 31 May 1961 the Union of South Africa became the Republic of South Africa. Republic of South Africa =1961 to 1969= Albert Hertzog Tower The Albert Hertzog Tower in Brixton Johannesburg was completed in 1962. It is 237-metre-high (778 ft) high concrete radio and (now) television tower. The first transmission took place on 22 December 1961. Presently 18 FM programs and 7 TV stations are broadcast from there. When Albert Hertzog fell into disfavour with the government, it was called the Brixton Tower. At present it is called the Sentech Tower. In 1964 the Johannesburg Botanical Garden was established in the suburb of Emmarentia. The Emmarentia Dam forms part of the Garden. The Garden is best known for its roses. The Rand Afrikaans University was founded in 1966. Its first campus was on the erstwhile premises of South African Breweries in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Later it moved to its new campus in Auckland Park. The University of Johannesburg came into existence on 1 January 2005 as the result of a merger between the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), the Technikon Witwatersrand (TWR) and the Soweto and East Rand campuses of Vista University. =1970 to 1979= thumb The Standard Bank Centre is in Fox and Simmond Streets in central Johannesburg. During the excavation, three stories below ground level, they came across an old stope. It was part of the workings of the old Ferreira Mine. The building's foundations were stabilised by backfilling the No. 1 level of the workings with concrete grout, but part of the stope was preserved as a museum. The building was completed in 1970. It was constructed by first building a central core and cantilever arms and then suspending the floors from the arms. The Centre houses a renowned art gallery. The Carlton Hotel, Johannesburg The enormous Carlton Centre, built at a cost of R88 million, contained a fifty-storey office tower, the thirty-storey luxury Carlton Hotel, a five-storey Garlicks department store, three-and-a- half-acre public plaza with a two-story underground shopping centre beneath it and parking garages with space for 2000 cars. The Carlton Hotel (Johannesburg) opened for business on 1 October 1972. Hillbrow Tower left and Ponte City right Ponte City is a skyscraper in the Berea neighbourhood, just next to Hillbrow. It was built in 1975 to a height of 173 m (567.6 ft), making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa. In 1971 the South African Broadcasting Corporation was eventually allowed to introduce a television service. When television was finally introduced, there was only one channel with airtime divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, alternating between the two languages. Test transmissions in Johannesburg began on 5 May 1975, followed in July by ones in Cape Town and Durban. Nationwide services finally commenced on 5 January 1976. In 1971 Parliament passed the Black Affairs Administration Act, No. 45 of 1971. In terms of this Act the central government appointed the West Rand Administration Board to take over the powers and obligations of the Johannesburg City Council in respect of Soweto.Mngomezulu & Others v City Council of Soweto, (1988) ZASCA 163. As chairman of the board it appointed Manie Mulder, a political appointment of a person who had no experience of the administration of native affairs.David Grinker, Inside Soweto: Memoir of an Official 1960s to 80s, Eastern Enterprises, 2014, p. xii The Soweto Uprising was a series of protests led by high school students in South Africa that began on the morning of 16 June 1976. Students from numerous Sowetan schools began to protest in the streets of Soweto in response to the introduction of Afrikaans as the medium of instruction in local schools. It is estimated that 20,000 students took part in the protests. The number of protesters killed by police was officially given as 176, but estimates of up to 700 have been made. In remembrance of these events, 16 June is now a public holiday in South Africa. A thirteen year old Black boy, Hector Pieterson, is the iconic first victim of police brutality, but Dr Melville Edelstein, who had devoted his life to social welfare among blacks, was soon forgotten. He was stoned to death by the mob and left with a sign around his neck proclaiming \\"Beware Afrikaners\\". Following the riots the government founded three community councils, namely Soweto proper, Dobsonville and Diepmeadow (the latter for the townships of Diepkloof and Meadowlands). When elections were held for their councils, only 16% of voters in Diepmeadow and 6% in Soweto went to the polls. In 1978 the government transferred local administrative powers to the three councils, but their decisions had to be ratified by the Minister of Plural Relations.Grinker, supra, p. xiv. In 1983 the community councils acquired full local government status in terms of the Black Local Authorities Act, No. 102 of 1982Grinker, supra, p. 22. Bulldozed house in Pageview Fietas Museum Pursuant to the Group Areas Act, Pageview (previously a part of Vrededorp) was declared a white group area on 27 July 1956. The result was that all \\"non- whites\\" became \\"disqualified persons\\" in Pageview and were obliged to leave the area.Nazir Carrim, Fietas, Save Pageview Association, 2000, p. 89. Between 1964 and 1970 all non-white (mainly Indian) residents were issued ejectment orders. Some moved to the new Indian suburb of Lenasia, while others resisted the orders.Carrim, supra, p. 104. The government tried to force the removal by closing all the Indian schools in the Pageview area.Carrim, supra, p. 108. During the period 1974 to 1981 the government gradually removed all Indians from their homes and shops and dumped them in Lenasia.Carrim, supra, p. 126. Bulldozers moved in and demolished most of the structures.Carrim, supra, p.148. One of the structures not demolished, was a shop belonging to the Surtees outfitters. It is now the Fietas Museum. =1980 to 1989= Midrand was established as a municipality in 1981 (in an area known as Halfway House, after its position between Pretoria and Johannesburg), but ceased to be an independent town in the restructuring of local government that followed the end of apartheid in 1994. It was incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in 2000. In 1982 Parliament passed the Black Local Authorities Act, No. 102 of 1982. In terms of this Act the City Council of Soweto came into being.Mngomezulu & Others v City Council of Soweto, (1988)ZASCA, 163 =1990 to 1994= The New South Africa The establishment of metropolitan municipalities took a long time. In 1989 the Central Witwatersrand Metropolitan Chamber came into being to show the way for local government transition across the country. In 1993 the Local Government Transition Act, No. 203 of 1993, recognised the importance of negotiation and formalised the Greater Johannesburg Local Negotiating Forum. The Act provided for a two-tier system of government with strong local councils and a weaker metro tier playing a coordinating role. The first fully democratic local government elections were held in November 1995. It gave birth to a Greater Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council and four Transitional Metropolitan Local Councils. Unfortunately this arrangement led to a very serious financial crisis, mainly because the local councils were not obliged to balance their budgets. In the meantime Chapter 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, dealt with local government. In terms of section 155(1)(a) a category A municipality is one that has exclusive municipal executive and legislative authority in its area. In the Municipal Structures Act (Act 117 of 1998) it is laid down that this type of local government is to be used for conurbations, i.e. \\"centre[s] of economic activity\\", areas \\"for which integrated development planning is desirable\\", and areas with \\"strong interdependent social and economic linkages\\". Johannesburg is such a municipality and these are called Metropolitan Municipalities. Eleven local authorities were to be joined together in 2000 to form the new Johannesburg metropolitan municipality. These included Roodepoort, Randburg, Sandton, Johannesburg, Soweto, Diepmeadow, Dobsonville, Lenasia and Midrand.

Founded in 1867, ASU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.  History  Alabama State University was founded in 1867 as the Lincoln Normal School of Marion in Marion. In December 1873, the State Board accepted the transfer of title to the school after a legislative act was passed authorizing the state to fund a Normal School, and George N. Card was named president. Thus, in 1874, this predecessor of Alabama State University became America's first state-supported educational institution for blacks. This began ASU's history as a \\"teachers' college.\\" In 1878, the second president, William Paterson, was appointed. He is honored as a founder of Alabama State University and was the president for 37 of the school's first 48 years. Paterson was instrumental in the move from Marion to Montgomery in 1887. In 1887, the university opened in its new location in Montgomery, but an Alabama State Supreme Court ruling forced the school to change its name; it was renamed the Normal School for Colored Students. The campus was chosen in 1889 although preparing the buildings at the site took a while longer. In the decades that followed, Lincoln Normal School became a junior college, and in 1928 became a full four-year institution. In 1929 it became State Teachers College, Alabama State College for Negroes in 1948, and Alabama State College in 1954. In 1969, the State Board of Education, then the governing body of the university, approved a name change; the institution became Alabama State University. The 1995 Knight vs. Alabama remedial decree transformed ASU into a comprehensive regional institution paving the way for two new undergraduate programs, four new graduate programs, diversity scholarship funding and endowment, funding to build a state-of-the art health sciences facility, and a facility renewal allocation to refurbish three existing buildings. WVAS-FM was launched on June 15, 1984, beaming 25,000 watts of power from the fifth floor of the Levi Watkins Learning Center for two years before moving to its current location at Thomas Kilby Hall. Today, WVAS has grown to 80,000 watts and has a listenership that spans 18 counties, reaching a total population of more than 651,000. In recent years, the station has also begun streaming its broadcast via the Web, connecting a global audience to the university. The early 1990s witnessed the beginning of WAPR-FM (Alabama Public Radio), which Alabama State University and Troy University, both of which already held station licenses of their own, cooperated with the University of Alabama in building and operating.

Bush. Rainville won the Republican primary on September 12, beating Shepard by a wide margin. There were also numerous third party and independent candidates: Chris Karr (WTP), Bruce Marshall (Green Party), Dennis Morrisseau (Ind), Jane Newton (Liberty Union Party), Keith Stern (Ind), and Jerry Trudell (Ind). Morrisseau gathered the most votes, with 1% or 1,383 votes. By September 14, 2006, the race between Rainville and Welch was close. An American Research Group poll showed Welch with a 48‚Äì45% lead. On October 4, 2006, The Burlington Free Press reported that one of Rainville's staffers, Christopher Stewart, resigned from her campaign after committing plagiarism‚Äîcopying policy statements from other politicians, including Senator Hillary Clinton, and using them on Rainville's website.

Ace was performed by Jim Carrey in the films Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, released in 1994, and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, released in 1995, and was voiced by Michael Daingerfield in the Ace Ventura: Pet Detective television series. Biography Ace is a Miami-based private detective specializing in the retrieval of missing animals, the son of Rex Ventura and descendant of such as \\"Ernest Ventura Shackleton\\" and \\"Jacques Ventura Costeau\\". It is not known whether the animated television series was contiguous with the feature-films; but if it was it may take place before them because the only one of his pets to appear in the series is his capuchin monkey, Spike. His eccentricities make him a laughing stock to the Miami-Dade Police Department in the early part of the first movie, but he eventually earned their respect after his rescue of Dan Marino and the dolphin, Snowflake. =Ace Ventura: Pet Detective= During the first film, Ace lives in an apartment alongside many different animals, all of whom hide from his landlord, Mr. Schickadance (Mark Margolis) in his absence, and to whom he owes money for rent. He is tasked with not only finding a stolen dolphin, but also trying to prevent the kidnapping of Dan Marino from a psychopath ex-football player, Ray Finkle, bent on revenge for costing the Dolphins the game with the botched field goal. He is certain that Finkle is the man responsible, but he can't find Finkle. Ace also learns of a missing hiker who coincidentally is named Lt. Lois Einhorn and tries to figure out the connection she has with his suspect. Eventually, Ace not only discovers the connection that Finkle has with Einhorn, but also that they're the same person in a transgender disguise. This may imply that Finkle had killed Einhorn, and then undergone a partial sex change to assume her identity and take advantage of her position in the Miami PD. Disgusted by the thought that when he had been previously kissed by Einhorn, he had actually been kissed by a man, Ace spends the night rinsing his mouth out and washing himself. Following Einhorn to the hideout inside a wharf, he tries to test his theory on her but finds a normal feminine body and actual hair. Before Ace was about to give up, Marino secretly alerts him to a bulge sticking between her legs. With concrete proof, Ace makes a short humiliating speech at Einhorn while revealing to the entire Miami PD about her true motive in killing Roger Podacter, when he discovered her true identity as Finkle (\\"He found Captain Winky!\\"). He proves it by forcibly turning Einhorn over to reveal the bulge sticking out of her silk panties. Everyone in the PD, as well as Marino and Snowflake, reacts in disgust when they learned that Finkle had kissed them the same way as Ace. Now humiliated and exposed, Finkle makes her last attempt to kill Ace out of revenge, but he flips her over into the wharf. As he attempts to pull himself up, Ace steps over Finkle's hand and takes the ring which was indeed missing a stone to finalize his theory that Einhorn is no doubt the disgraced Ray Finkle. Ace begins a relationship with Miami Dolphins press officer, Melissa Robinson, while Finkle is arrested for her crimes. =Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls= During the second film, Ace attempts monasticism after a failed rescue attempt of a raccoon, only to be called out of retirement to investigate a missing sacred animal named Shikaka, although he has a severe fear of bats. During meditation with the Abbot, he discovers Vincent Cadby who originally hired him to find the bat is the same kidnapper who wanted the war to happen so he can take control of the guano deposits there. He thwarts Cadby's plans to have the two tribes go to war and returns the sacred bat. After the marriage between the Wachati chief's daughter and Tiny Warrior, Ace is eventually hunted down by both tribes, implying he had something to do with the princess no longer being a virgin. Family and Ace Irwin Ventura Jr. By the events portrayed in Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective, it is established that after resolving his case in Africa, Ace returned to Miami and started a family. He married Melissa and they had a son, Jr.. But Ace has disappeared somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle, and never appears in the film itself. However, Ace Jr. inherited his ability to discern trouble, which he must rely on when he must assist in finding his classmates' pets along with the missing animals and clear his mother's name when she is accused of the theft. Ace Jr. believes her innocence and seeks the help of his grandfather, Rex, to help him investigate the whole thing. They begin to suspect that one of his classmates was involved in the theft and with the help of A-Plus, Ace Jr. suspects that Pennington Jr. had been involved with Dr. Sickenger (who is insane). Sickenger is found to be innocent and he helps lead Ace Jr. along with Rex to the true culprit, Quinton Pennington Sr. After finding the animals in the Pennington family home, Pennington Sr. confesses to his crime, admitting that he stole the pets along with the famous animals because he was trying to keep his son happy. He eventually got fed up with his spoiled nature when he refused to be satisfied. Melissa is cleared of the theft charges and Pennington Sr. is arrested for his crimes. Ace Jr. is rewarded as a hero for his efforts. Personality Ace Ventura is an eccentric self-styled \\"pet detective\\" who forsook regular police work to concentrate on this latter pursuit. Like other fictional detectives, he is notable for extraordinary powers of observation and deduction; and on at least one occasion, he has managed to escape being shot by catching a bullet in his teeth. Ventura's eccentricities include his persistent vulgarity and exceedingly flamboyant behaviour; despite this, he is a dedicated detective, driven by an insatiable adoration of animals and a desire to protect them from human mistreatment. In Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective, it is implied that his abilities, personality and appearance are hereditary. Although Ace is an animal lover, Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls reveals a deep-seated fear of bats. Ace as he appears in the animated series. In most appearances, Ace usually wears an unbuttoned Aloha shirt over a plain white A-shirt, with red and black striped trousers and black biker boots.  Crossover with The Mask In the episode \\"The Aceman Cometh\\" of The Mask: Animated Series, when Milo, the pet dog of Stanley Ipkiss, was stolen by Dr. Pretorius, Ipkiss calls Ace for help. Both Ipkiss/the Mask and Ace Ventura were the animated versions of characters portrayed by Jim Carrey himself. The crossover continued in the Ace Ventura: Pet Detective episode \\"Have Mask, Will Travel\\", in which Ace accidentally wears the mask on his buttocks, which assumes a face similar to his own and gains the ability to speak, suggesting a joke featured in Ace Ventura: Pet Detective of speaking while presenting his rump to the listener and moving it in semblance of a speaking mouth.  Reception  Ace was ranked the 59th Greatest Movie Character in a November 2008 list by Empire Magazine. Despite his popularity, he was also voted one of the most annoying film characters ever in a British online poll.

It is found in eastern and southern Africa, and is the national bird of Uganda. Taxonomy The grey crowned crane is closely related to the black crowned crane, and the two species have sometimes been treated as the same species. The two are separable on the basis of genetic evidence, calls, plumage and bare parts, and all authorities treat them as different species today. There are two subspecies. The East African B. r. gibbericeps (crested crane) occurs in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, of which it is the national bird represented in its national flag, and Kenya to eastern South Africa. It has a larger area of bare red facial skin above the white patch than the smaller nominate species, B. r. regulorum (South African crowned crane), which breeds from Angola south to South Africa. Description Portrait Two adults face to face The grey crowned crane is about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, weighs 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), and has a wingspan of 2 m (6.5 ft). Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are predominantly white, but contain feathers with a range of colours, with a distinctive black patch at the very top. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers. The sides of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger. Young birds are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff face. This species and the black- crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees, because of a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is assumed to be an ancestral trait among the cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily. Crowned cranes also lack a coiled trachea and have loose plumage compared to the other cranes. Distribution and habitat In Serengeti National Park, Tanzania It occurs in dry savannah in Sub-Saharan Africa, although it nests in somewhat wetter habitats. They can also be found in marshes, cultivated lands and grassy flatlands near rivers and lakes in Uganda and Kenya and as far south as South Africa. This animal does not have set migration patterns, and birds nearer the tropics are typically sedentary. Birds in more arid areas, particularly Namibia, make localised seasonal movements during drier periods. Behaviour The grey crowned crane has a breeding display involving dancing, bowing, and jumping. It has a booming call which involves inflation of the red gular sac. It also makes a honking sound quite different from the trumpeting of other crane species. Both sexes dance, and immature birds join the adults. Dancing is an integral part of courtship, but also may be done at any time of the year. Flocks of 30‚Äì150 birds are not uncommon. =Diet and feeding= These cranes are omnivores, eating plants, seeds, grain, insects, frogs, worms, snakes, small fish and the eggs of aquatic animals. Stamping their feet as they walk, they flush out insects which are quickly caught and eaten. The birds also associate with grazing herbivores, benefiting from the ability to grab prey items disturbed by antelopes and gazelles. They spend their entire day looking for food. At night, the crowned crane spends its time in the trees sleeping and resting. =Breeding= Eggs of Balearica regulorum gibbericeps at the MHNT A chick in Tehran Birds Garden Grey crowned cranes time their breeding season around the rains, although the effect varies geographically. In East Africa the species breeds year-round, but most frequently during the drier periods, whereas in Southern Africa the breeding season is timed to coincide with the rains. During the breeding season, pairs of cranes construct a large nest; a platform of grass and other plants in tall wetland vegetation. The grey crowned crane lays a clutch of 2-5 glossy, dirty-white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes for 28‚Äì31 days. Chicks are precocial, can run as soon as they hatch, and fledge in 56‚Äì100 days. Once they are fully grown and independent, chicks of different sexes will separate from their parents to start their own family. Grey crowned cranes have been seen to congregate in large numbers in a ceremony akin to a wedding when two chicks are being married off. The new couple dance for a while before flying off together to start a new family. Relationship with humans =Status and conservation= Although the grey crowned crane remains common over some of its range, it faces threats to its habitat due to drainage, overgrazing, and pesticide pollution. Their global population is estimated to be between 58,000 and 77,000 individuals. In 2012 it was uplisted from vulnerable to endangered by the IUCN. =Symbolism= Flag of Uganda The grey crowned crane is the national bird of Uganda and features in the country's flag and coat of arms.

He was named \\"Chef of the Century\\" by the guide Gault Millau in 1989, and awarded the Meilleur Ouvrier de France (France's best worker) in cuisine in 1976. He published several cookbooks, two of which have been translated into English, chaired the committee for the Larousse Gastronomique, and hosted culinary television shows in France. He operated more than a dozen restaurants in Bangkok, Bordeaux, Hong Kong, Las Vegas, London, Macau, Monaco, Montreal, Paris, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, and New York City, with the highest record of a total of 32 Michelin Guide stars among them (31 at the time of his death), the most of any chef in the world.Masterchef: The Professionals 2010 (Episode 16) Biography Robuchon was born in 1945 in Poitiers, France, one of four children of a bricklayer. He attended the seminary in Ch√¢tillon-sur-S√®vre (now Maul√©on), Deux-S√®vres, briefly considering a clerical career. In 1960, at the age of 15, he became an apprentice chef at the Relais de Poitiers hotel, starting as a pastry chef. After he turned 21, he joined the apprenticeship \\"Compagnon du Tour de France\\", enabling him to travel throughout the country, learning a variety of regional techniques. At the age of 29, Robuchon was appointed as head chef at the H√¥tel Concorde La Fayette, where he managed 90 cooks. In 1976 he won the Meilleur Ouvrier de France for his craftsmanship in culinary arts. While working as an Executive Chef and Food and Beverage manager of the Nikko hotel in Paris he gained two Michelin stars. In 1981 he opened his own restaurant, Jamin, which holds the rare distinction of receiving three Michelin stars in the first three years of existence. In 1984, Jamin is named \\"Best Restaurant in the World\\" by International Herald Tribune. Between 1987 and 1990, he became a regular of cooking shows on French television. In 1989, prestigious restaurant guide Gault Millau named Robuchon the ‚ÄùChef of the Century\\". He mentored many famous chefs, including Gordon Ramsay, Eric Ripert, and Michael Caines. In 1995, seeing many of his peers die of stress and heart attacks, Robuchon retired at the age of 50. He subsequently staged a comeback, opening several restaurants bearing his name around the world. He hosted Cuisinez comme un grand chef on TF1 from 1996 to 1999; in 2000, he hosted Bon app√©tit bien s√ªr on France 3. Through his various restaurants, including the newly awarded 3-star rating for his restaurant in Singapore, he accumulated a total of 32 Michelin Guide stars - the most of any chef in the world. In June 2018, Resort World Singapore stated that both the three-Michelin-starred Joel Robuchon Restaurant and the two-starred L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon would close at the end of the month. Robuchon was a Freemason of the Grande Loge Nationale Fran√ßaise, but claimed it did not affect his career.Interview to L'Express Robuchon died from cancer on 6 August 2018, a year after receiving treatment for a pancreatic tumour. He was 73. Personal life Robuchon and his wife Jeanine, whom he married in 1966, had two children, son Eric Robuchon, a pedicurist and podiatrist based in Paris, and daughter Sophie Kartheiser, who manages a restaurant named La Cour d'Eymet in Dordogne with her husband, chef Fran√ßois Kartheiser. He also has a son Louis Robuchon-Abe (born 1988) with a Japanese woman. Louis is a wine bar owner in Japan. Robuchon was survived by his wife, his three children and four grandchildren.https://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/a-la-une/tous-heritiers-de- robuchon Legacy Robuchon has been the most influential French chef of the post-nouvelle cuisine era. Since the mid-1980s, he has been called the primus inter pares of Paris' three star chefs for his work both at Jamin and at his eponymous restaurant. Robuchon has been known for the relentless perfectionism of his cuisine; he said there is no such thing as the perfect meal - one can always do better. He was instrumental in leading French cuisine forward from the excessive reductionism of nouvelle cuisine toward a post-modern amalgam of the nouvelle, international influences - especially Japanese cuisine - and even select traditions of haute cuisine. In particular, his style of cooking was often seen as of celebrating the intrinsic qualities of the best, seasonal ingredients (dubbed \\"cuisine actuelle\\" by Patricia Wells in her book, \\"Simply French\\"). Drawing his inspiration firstly from the simplicity of Japanese cuisine, he led the way in creating a more delicate style respectful of natural food ingredients.

Pulling (June 30, 1948 ‚Äì September 18, 1997)Social Security Death Index; Patricia A. Pulling; 223-68-4625 was an anti-occult campaigner from Richmond, Virginia. She founded Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons (BADD), an advocacy group that was dedicated to the regulation of role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Biography Pulling formed B.A.D.D. after her son Irving committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest on June 9, 1982. Irving was active in role-playing games, and she believed his suicide was directly related to the Dungeons & Dragons game. The grieving mother first filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her son's high school principal, Robert A. Bracey III, holding him as responsible for what she claimed was a D&D; curse placed upon her son's character shortly before his death. She also filed suit against TSR, Inc., D&D;'s publishers. She appeared on an episode of 60 Minutes which also featured Gary Gygax, creator of Dungeons & Dragons, and which aired in 1985. =B.A.D.D.= Pulling founded the public advocacy group \\"Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons\\" (B.A.D.D.) in 1983 after all of her lawsuits were dismissed and began publishing information circulating her belief that D&D; encouraged devil worship and suicide. B.A.D.D. described D&D; as \\"a fantasy role-playing game which uses demonology, witchcraft, voodoo, murder, rape, blasphemy, suicide, assassination, insanity, sex perversion, homosexuality, prostitution, satanic type rituals, gambling, barbarism, cannibalism, sadism, desecration, demon summoning, necromantics, divination and other teachings.\\" B.A.D.D. achieved some success in airing its views in the press, both through conservative Christian media properties as well as mainstream outlets. The organization distributed its materials in Australia through conservative advocacy groups affiliated with the Reverend Fred Nile, such as the Australian Federation for Decency. In addition, Pulling obtained a private investigator's license, became a consultant to law enforcement, and was an expert witness in several gaming-related lawsuits, all of which lost in court. She became a director of the National Coalition on TV Violence in 1984. Pulling co-authored a book, The Devil's Web: Who Is Stalking Your Children For Satan? published in August 1989. The book makes no distinction between H. P. Lovecraft's fictional Necronomicon and the Simon Necronomicon, a realization of the book. One portion of the book urges police officers to open interrogations of suspected teenage occultists with the question \\"Have you read the Necronomicon, or are you familiar with it?\\" As the popularity of Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games increased, Pulling's views and statements were increasingly called into question. For example, she once told a newspaper reporter that eight percent of the people living in Richmond, Virginia were Satanists. She had arrived at that figure, she explained, by estimating that four percent of adults and four percent of teenagers were involved with Satanism, and added them to get eight percent. When the reporter informed her that mathematically that was four percent, not eight percent, she claimed that it did not matter because even eight percent was a \\"conservative\\" figure. Response In 1989, game player and designer Michael A. Stackpole wrote Game Hysteria and the Truth, which went into all the flaws, misconceptions, inaccuracies, omission of relevant details, and questionable practices (including calling her editing of newspaper accounts illegal, since newspapers are copyrighted material and the owners were not contacted about the use of these articles) regarding Pulling's claims about RPGs in general and D&D; in particular, concluding: \\"If the suicide statistics for the 14 years since D&D;'s introduction show anything at all, gamers kill themselves at a rate that is a fraction of that of their peers.\\"Game Hysteria and the TruthHicks, Robert D. (1991) In pursuit of Satan: the police and the occult p. 291 A year later, the main points of Game Hysteria and the Truth regarding Pulling were reiterated by Stackpole in The Pulling Report, a review highly critical of B.A.D.D.'s methods of data collection, analysis and reporting. Stackpole determined that Pulling had misrepresented her credentials, and after the report was published in 1990, Pulling left B.A.D.D. Aftermath By 1991 the American Association of Suicidology, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, and Health and Welfare Canada all concluded that there was no causal link between fantasy gaming and suicide. B.A.D.D. effectively ceased to exist when Pulling died of lung cancer in 1997.

The national anthem of Kiribati is \\"Teirake kaini Kiribati\\" (Stand Kiribati), by Uriam Uriam; it was adopted upon independence in 1979. Kiribati folk music is generally based on chanting or other forms of vocalizing, accompanied by body percussion. Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (Te Kaimatoa) or the hip dance (Te Buki) a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed so as to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also stick dances (which accompany legends and semi-historical stories. These stick dances or 'tirere' (pronounced seerere) are only performed during major festivals. In 1963 Gerd Koch filmed on Tabiteuea traditional dances and songs of the ruoia series: the kawawa, the introductory song and dance; the kamei with a dance leader, the wan tarawa and the kabuakaka; and a bino song and dance complete with accompanying arm movements. Koch also filmed traditions songs and dances on Onotoa and Nonouti. Bata Teinamati has been described as one of Kiribati's most notable musicians.\\"Country profile: Kiribati\\", The Guardian, April 22, 2009 Folk song composition Its traditional music is composed by people known as te kainikamaen. These composers are said to receive their songs from myth or magic, an ability that is said to pass from father to son. After composition, a group called rurubene sings the song to the composer, after which it is made public and is sung by anyone; at this point, the song is considered blessed (mamiraki). Composers also write songs on demand, telling a story told to him by an individual. The composer will then sing it and teach it to the rurubene, making any needed changes. Composers also occasionally create songs of their own accord. Nowadays, not all music in Kiribati is composed by people known as te kainikamaen because of civilization and because of the introduction of western music, rather almost anyone can compose a song and sing it but he/she needs to count is as a song from a poem not from myth or magic otherwise there may be curses as part of the Kiribati Beliefs. Curses include: losing of hair and sudden death.

The treaty consisted of several agreements, including the Treaty of Wehlau signed on 19 September 1657 by the Brandenburg‚ÄìPrussian and Polish‚ÄìLithuanian envoys in Wehlau (Welawa, now Znamensk). Thus, the treaty of Bromberg is sometimes referred to as treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg or Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg (). In exchange for military aid in the Second Northern War and the return of Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) to Poland, the Polish king granted the Hohenzollern dynasty of Brandenburg hereditary sovereignty in the Duchy of Prussia, pawned Draheim (Drahim) and Elbing (ElblƒÖg) to Brandenburg, and handed over Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land to the Hohenzollerns as a hereditary fief. The treaty was confirmed and internationally recognized in the Peace of Oliva in 1660. While Elbing was kept by Poland, Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land and Draheim were subsequently integrated into Brandenburg-Prussia. The sovereignty in Prussia constituted the basis for the later coronation of the Hohenzollern as Prussian kings. Wehlau-Bromberg remained in effect until it was superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (18 September 1773) following the First Partition of Poland. The treaty is regarded as one of the biggest mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia and its consequences were fatal to Poland.Miasta warmi≈Ñskie w latach 1655-1663 J√≥zef W≈Çodarski Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Pedagogiczna w Olsztynie,page 62, 1993 Historical context Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia The Duchy of Prussia was established as a Polish fief under duke Albrecht (Albert) in the Treaty of Cracow of 8 April 1525.J√§hnig (2006), p. 71 The fief was hereditary, and in case Albrecht or his brothers' house became extinct in the male line, the treaty provided for it to pass on to the Polish king, who would then be obliged to appoint a German-speaking Prussian-born governor. On 4 June 1563, this provision was changed by Polish king Sigismund II Augustus in a privilege issued at Petrikau, which in addition to Albrecht's branch of the House of Hohenzollern (Hohenzollern-Ansbach) also allowed the Brandenburg branch of the Hohenzollern as possible successors.Ma≈Ç≈Çek (2006), p. 75 This privilege provided for the succession of the Brandenburgian electors as Prussian dukes upon the extinction of the House of Hohenzollern-Ansbach in 1618. In 1656, during the early Second Northern War, the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern first took the Prussian duchy and Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) as Swedish fiefs in the Treaty of K√∂nigsberg, before the Swedish king released them from the vassalage and made them absolute sovereigns in these provinces.Vierhaus (1984), p. 169 After fighting alongside with the Swedish army in 1656, most prominently in the Battle of Warsaw, Hohenzollern Frederick William I was willing to abandon his ally when the war had turned against them, and signalled his willingness to change sides if Polish king John II Casimir Vasa would grant him similar privileges as previously the Swedish king Charles X Gustav - these conditions were negotiated in Wehlau (Welawa, now Znamensk) and Bromberg (Bygost, Bydgoszcz).Wilson (1998), pp. 36-37 The Polish interest in an alliance with Brandenburg-Prussia was born out of the need to end the war with Sweden as soon as possible.Frost (2004), p. 98 On 3 November 1656, the Truce of Vilna had promised Alexis of Russia's election as a successor on the Polish throne at the next diet in turn for halting his offensive in Poland‚ÄìLithuania and fight Sweden instead.Frost (2004), p. 82 While in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania there was support for this treaty among the nobles, who hoped for more privileged positions, this was not true for the Kingdom of Poland, where the elites looked for ways to circumvent Alexis' succession.Frost (2004), pp. 86, 89, 98, 103, 128, 132 To quickly end the war with Sweden and thus be able to avoid the implementation of the Truce of Vilna, the anti-Swedish alliance had to be extended. The new-won Russian ally was reluctant to support Poland against Sweden as long as no diet had confirmed the Truce.Frost (2004), p. 86 A second ally, the Austrian Habsburgs were won in the first and second Vienna treaties,Frost (2004), p. 95 yet as the Habsburg forces were to be maintained by Poland, this alliance's prize was bound to rise the longer the war lasted. A third ally was Denmark-Norway, which joined the anti-Swedish coalition in June 1657 triggered by the second treaty of Vienna. Yet, Denmark was not fighting on Polish soil, and although its involvement bound Charles X Gustav's forces and a formal alliance with Poland‚ÄìLithuania was concluded in July, the Danish war aim was to recover Scandinavian territories lost in the Second Treaty of Br√∂msebro (1645). The Habsburgs' interest in the treaty was to build up good relations to Frederick William I, who as a prince-elector was a valuable ally if he was to support their policy in the Holy Roman Empire.Frost (2004), p. 97 Thus, the Habsburgs were interested in Frederick William I changing from the Swedish to their camp, and sent diplomat Franz Paul Freiherr von Lisola to mediate a respective settlement. Bromberg and Wehlau are regarded as \\"twin treaties\\",Nolan (2008), p. 334 \\"supplementary treaties\\"Stone (2001), p. 169 or one treaty, sometimes referred to as \\"Treaty of Wehlau and Bromberg\\"Materna (1995), p. 318 or \\"Treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg.\\"Frost (2004), p. 105 Ratification and confirmation King John II Casimir of Poland The preliminary treaty of Wehlau had been signed on 19 September 1657 by Frederick William I's envoys von Schwerin and von Somnitz, as well as by Warmian (Ermland) prince-bishop and Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski for the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and Habsburg delegate and mediator Freiherr .Frost (2004), pp. 97, 104Signatories at Wehlau (per Annotated edition, IEG Mainz, retrieved 2010-02-22 ): *Venceslaus de Leszno, episcopus Varmien[sis] s[acrae] r[egiae] m[ajesta]tis Poloniae et Sueciae plenipotentiarius *Vincentius Corvinus Gosiewski, supremus thesaurarius et campiductor m[agni] d[ucatus] L[ithuaniae] s[acrae] r[egiae] m[ajestatis] Poloniae et Sueciae plenipotentiarius *F[ranciscus] De Lisola, seren[issimi] m[ajestatis] Hungariae et Bohemiae regis ad hosce tractatum pro mediatione ablegatus, eiusdemque consiliarius *Ottho Liber Baro a Schwerin, plenipotentiarius electoralis *Laurentius Christophorus Somnitz, Plenipotentiarius electoralis The amended and final version of the treaty was ratified on 6 November by Frederick William I and John II Casimir in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz).Biereigel (2005), p. 63The signatories at Bromberg also included Miko≈Çaj Prazmowski and Kazimierz Samuel Kuszewicz.

Agreements The treaty ratified in Bromberg consisted of three parts. The first one contained twenty-two articlesKami≈Ñska (1983), p. 9 and dealt primarily with the status and succession of Prussia, the Brandenburg-Polish alliance and military aid, it was drafted in Wehlau and signed there by the Brandenburgian and Polish plenipotentiaries and the Habsburg mediator. The second part was a special convention (\\"Specialis Convention\\") containing 6 articles, also drafted and signed by the plenipotentiaries and the mediator in Wehlau, which further detailed the alliance and military aid. The third part amended the Wehlau agreement and primarily detailed Polish concessions.Annotated edition, IEG Mainz, retrieved 2010-02-22 =On the status of Prussia= The Duchy of Prussia, where Frederick William I was full sovereign by the Brandenburg-Swedish Treaty of Labiau, was accepted by the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth to be the sovereign possession of the House of Hohenzollern.J√§hnig (2006), p. 68 archbishop of Ermland (Warmia) Hereditary Hohenzollern sovereignty was only agreed on for the Duchy of Prussia, while Ermland (Ermeland, Warmia) was to be returned to Poland. In case of the extinction of the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern dynasty in the male line, it was agreed that the Prussian duchy should pass on to the Polish crown. Owing to this clause, the Prussian estates were obliged to pay conditional allegiance to an envoy of subsequent Polish kings upon their succession (\\"hommagium eventuale, Eventualhuldigung\\"), while they were released from previous oaths and obligations regarding the Polish crown. The Roman Catholic Church in the former Duchy of Prussia was to remain subordinate to the archbishop of Ermland (Warmia),Kami≈Ñska (1983), p. 10 retain its possessions and income and be granted religious freedom.Bahlcke (2008), p. 124 =On military aid= Brandenburg-Prussia was obliged to militarily aid Poland against the Swedish Empire in the ongoing Second Northern War.Schmidt (2006), p. 103 Frederick William I had already in Wehlau agreed to aid John II Casimir Vasa with 8,000 men,Motsch (2001), p. 85 and both parties agreed on an \\"eternal alliance\\".Wilson (1998), p. 36 In Bromberg it was agreed that from his Prussian province, Frederick William I was to dispatch 1,500 foot and 500 horse to join the army of the Polish king.Friedrich (2006), p. 150 =Financial and territorial agreements= K√∂nigsberg (January 1656) and Labiau (November 1656). In return, the Polish crown granted Brandenburg- Prussia Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land as a hereditary fief. The fief was to be held at the same conditions as previously granted to the House of Pomerania: it was to be free of duties, except that the House of Hohenzollern was obliged to send envoys to the coronations of successive Polish kings who were then to receive a written confirmation of the fief. In case the Hohenzollern dynasty was left without a male heir, the fief should return to the Polish crown. In addition to Lauenburg and B√ºtow land, Brandenburg-Prussia was to receive the town of Elbing (ElblƒÖg).Frost (2004), p. 104 In an amendment, Brandenburg- Prussia was obliged to return the town to Poland once the latter had bailed it out with 400,000 thalers.The sum stated as Elbing ransom by historian Robert I. Frost is 40,000 thalers in Frost (2004), p. 104, and 400,000 thalers in Frost (2000), p. 200. It is 300,000 thalers in Oakley (1992), p. 103 and Wilson (1998), p. 135. Kami≈Ñska (1983), p. 12 gives 400,000 thalers. The commented edition of the treaty at the Institut f√ºr Europ√§ische Geschichte (Institute for European History) in Mainz gives 400,000 reichstalers in the second amendment, overruling Article XII of the Wehlau tractates: instead of providing 500 horse, Brandenburg-Prussia was to return Elbing and level its fortification upon receiving the payment, sources given there are: AGADWarschau MK KK Volume 202, p. 40, print: Dogiel IV, p. 497; Pufendorf, p. 389; Dumont VI/2, p. 196; Dolezel, p. 208 The third Polish concession was the payment of 120,000 thalers to Brandenburg-Prussia for war-related damage suffered upon entering the war on the Polish side. As a security for this payment, the district of Draheim was to be handed over to Brandenburg for three years. This district comprised the town of Tempelburg (now Czaplinek) and 18 villages at the border of Brandenburgian Pomerania.Motsch (2001), p. 18 The sum was to be paid in annual rates of 40,000 thalers, and Brandenburg was to keep Draheim if not paid by the end of the third year. For the Catholics in Draheim, religious freedom was guaranteed. The Hohenzollern also agreed to grant religious freedom to the Catholic Church in Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land.Schmidt (2006), pp. 103-104 The Catholic communities were to stay subordinate to and be represented by the Kuyavian bishop and keep all of their income, while the Electors of Brandenburg and the local nobility were to have the patronage over the churches.Schmidt (2006), p. 104 The rights of the nobility of Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land were to be left unchanged, previous court sentences and privileges were to remain in force. The administration of the region should be exerted the same way as it was handled by the Pomeranian dukes. In a note issued separately from the treaty, John II Casimir assured the nobles that Poland would continue to treat them as members of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and that thus the nobles would enjoy the same rights and opportunities as the Polish nobles in case they decided to leave for Poland. Implementation and consequences =Prussia= The treaty first met the protest of the Prussian estates, who feared that the loss of privileges.Stone (2001), p. 170 As a leader of the opposition, K√∂nigsberg mayor Hieronymus Roth was incarcerated for sixteen years, until his death. The estates' protests ended in 1663, when they swore allegiance to Frederick William I. The ecclesiastical subordination of the Roman Catholic Church to the Polish Royal Prussian prince-bishop of Ermland (Warmia) also caused tensions with the House of Hohenzollern. Despite these problems, the sovereignty in the Prussian duchy provided the basis for the Brandenburgian Hohenzollern to crown themselves \\"King in Prussia\\" in 1701.Holborn (1982), p. 104 =Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land= Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land was officially handed over by John II Casimir's envoy Ignatz Bokowski and received by the Brandenburg-Prussian envoys Adam von Podewils and Ulrich Gottfried von Somnitz in April 1658. During the ceremony, the non-noble inhabitants swore the same oath of allegiance to the Brandenburgian electors that was previously sworn to the Pomeranian dukes, while the nobles swore a modified oath. The oath was given by 63 noble families from the Lauenburg district and 43 families of the B√ºtow district, represented at the ceremony by 220 persons. Three persons swore in Polish. The Brandenburg-Prussian administration did however not accept all of these families as nobles: in May, only thirteen indigenous and six immigrated Pomeranian families in the Lauenburg district and four families in the B√ºtow district were listed as nobles, the others were referred to as \\"besondere freye Leute\\" - \\"special free persons\\".Schmidt (2006), pp. 104-105 The Brandenburgian electors amended their title with \\"dominus de Lauenburg et Bytaw\\", despite Polish protests aimed at a change from \\"dominus\\" (lord) to \\"fiduciarus\\" (fiduciary). Until 1771, Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land was administered from Lauenburg (now Lebork), where the local Oberhauptmann had his seat, the nobles swore allegiance to the electors and assemblies of the nobles were held in a landtag named \\"Seymik\\".Schmidt (2006), p. 105 After 1771, the region was governed from Stettin (now Szczecin) like the rest of Brandenburgian Pomerania, and allegiance to subsequent Prussian kings was given together with the other Pomeranian estates in Stettin. The provision that Brandenburgian envoys were to be sent to the inauguration of subsequent Polish kings was followed until 1698, before Brandenburg-Prussia ceased to send delegations. The treaty of Bromberg was superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (1773), which followed the First Partition of Poland in 1772. In Warsaw, the terms of Bromberg were cancelled, including the guarantees for the Catholic Church and the nobles, and the Polish crown renounced all rights on Lauenburg and B√ºtow Land, which accordingly was no longer a fief and neither would be inherited by the Polish king in case the Hohenzollern line became extinct. =Elbing/ElblƒÖg= Elbing (ElblƒÖg) In 1660, the Swedish garrison withdrew from Elbing (ElblƒÖg), yet the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth seized it before Brandenburg-Prussia despite not having paid the sum agreed on in Bromberg. Because of this, Frederick William I did not support Poland in the contemporary Russo-Polish warFriedrich (2006), p. 151 and instead yielded the neutrality agreement he had concluded with Russia in 1656. Poland was to keep the town until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, with short interruptions in 1698/1699 and 1703: In 1698, Polish king August the Strong permitted Prussian troops to siege and storm Elbing,Wilson (1998), p. 135 but the Prussian troops withdrew in the following year when Russia mediated its exchange for the Polish Crown Jewels as a security for the bills receivable.Wilson (1998), p. 136 When August the Strong nevertheless failed to pay, the town was re-occupied in 1703, during the Great Northern War, but the Prussians again withdrew shortly afterwards due to Swedish pressure. =Draheim= Ruins of Draheim castle In addition to Elbing, the commonwealth aimed at also keeping Draheim, yet Frederick William I was able to thwart these plans by occupying it in 1663. While since the 1720s the government of the Brandenburgian province of Pomerania subsequently took over administrative tasks regarding Draheim, it retained its independence from the Pomeranian province until the terms of Bromberg were superseded by the Treaty of Warsaw (1773).Motsch (2001), p. 25 Before the 1773 treaty, Poland had nominally held the right to bail out Draheim,Motsch (2001), pp. 18-19 which however was never actually pursued.Motsch (2001), p. 87 Nevertheless, the Polish crown underlined this right by granting privileges to the local Schulze until 1680. In Article V of the Warsaw treaty, Poland renounced her right to buy Draheim back, and ceded it to Prussia \\"for eternal times\\". Impact and assessment According to Robert I. Frost the House of Hohenzollern, Wehlau-Bromberg was a \\"major geopolitical gain and surge in wealth and prestige\\",similarly: Frost (2004), p. 97: of \\"undeniable importance in the subsequent rise of Brandenburg-Prussia\\" while Poland had \\"substantially benefited\\" from Brandenburgian support during the war. The concessions Poland made in Wehlau and Bromberg were thought as tactical and open to later reversal - which however did not happen due to the internal weakness of the Commonwealth. Christopher M. Clark says that John Casimir of Poland was on the one hand \\"eager to separate Brandenburg from Sweden and to neutralize it as a military threat\\" when Poland‚ÄìLithuania was threatened by the Tsardom of Russia, and on the other hand was ready to accept the Hohenzollerns' demands due to pressure by the House of Habsburg, who after the emperor's incidental death earlier that year needed to secure the elector's vote, and whose \\"urgings [...] carried considerable weight since the Poles were counting on Austrian assistance in the event of a renewed Swedish or Russian attack.\\"Clark (2006), p. 49. Clark thus views Frederick William as a \\"beneficiary of international developments beyond his control,\\" and verifies his thesis by the post-Bromberg developments, where the elector lost all further war gains due to French intervention at the Treaty of Oliva.Clark (2006), pp. 49-50. J√≥zef W≈Çodarski regards the treaty as one of the heaviest mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia with fatal consequences for Poland.W≈Çodarski (1993), p. 62. According to Anna Kami≈Ñska, the treaty marked the point when Poland's influence on the Baltic was lost and Poland‚ÄìLithuania's position in Europe declined.Frost (2004), p. 97, referring to Kami≈Ñska (1983), p. 3 Frost says that the treaty was subject to criticism of historians such as Kazimierz Piwarski, who says that the price paid by Poland in Bromberg was unnecessarily high.Frost (2004), p. 97, referring to K. Piwarski (1938) According to Frost, these critics argue from a post-partition point of view, and neglect the complexity of the contemporary situation: \\"Contemporary [Polish] politicians were aware of the dangers of conceding sovereignty, which they accepted not because they were stupid, indifferent, or lacking in foresight, but because the alternatives seemed more damaging to the Commonwealth's interests\\", he says. While Frost regards Piwarski's assertion, that the Polish decision was heavily influenced by the Habsburgs, to have merit, he also says that the Polish interest in a rapprochement with Brandenburg had already emerged in 1656, long before Lisola entered the scene.

It specialises in operatic and musical productions, with occasional dramatic shows. History In April 1871, the brothers John and Michael Gunn obtained a 21-year license to establish \\"a well-regulated theatre and therein at all times publicly to act, represent or perform any interlude, tragedy, comedy, prelude, opera, burletta, play, farce or pantomime\\". The brothers built the Gaiety Theatre on South King Street for ¬£26,000. Designed by architect C.J. Phipps, construction was completed in just 28 weeks. The Gaiety was opened on 27 November 1871 with the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland as guest of honour for a double bill which included the comedy She Stoops to Conquer and a burlesque version of La Belle Sauvage. The Gaiety was extended by theatre architect Frank Matcham in 1883, and, despite several improvements to public spaces and stage changes, it retains several Victorian era features and remains Dublin's longest-established, continuously producing theatre. Patrick Wall and Louis Elliman bought the theatre in 1936 and ran it for several decades with local actors and actresses. They sold it in 1965, and in the 1960s and the 1970s the theatre was run by Fred O'Donovan and the Eamonn Andrews Studios, until - in the 1980s - Joe Dowling (former artistic director of the Abbey Theatre) became director of the Gaiety. In the 1990s, Groundwork Productions took on the lease and the theatre was eventually bought by the Break for the Border Group. The Gaiety was purchased by music promoters MCD (in turn owned by Denis Desmond and his wife Caroline) in the late 1990s. The new owners undertook a refit of the theatre, with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism contributing to the restoration fund. Use Performers and playwrights associated with the theatre have been celebrated with hand-prints cast in bronze and set in the pavement beneath the theatre canopy. These handprints include those of Luciano Pavarotti, Brendan Grace, Maureen Potter, Twink, John B Keane, Anna Manahan, Niall Toibin and Brian Friel. The theatre played host to the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest, the first to be staged in Ireland, during the Gaiety's centenary year. Clodagh Rodgers (a contestant in that particular contest) later presented her RT√â TV series The Clodagh Rodgers Show from the theatre in the late 1970s. The Gaiety is known for its annual Christmas pantomime and has hosted a pantomime every year since 1874. Actor and director Alan Stanford directed both Gaiety productions of Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. Irish entertainer June Rodgers starred in the Gaiety pantomime for years, until she began to headline the equally established Olympia Theatre panto. The Gaiety's pantomimes have included Irish performers that appeal to home grown audiences, including a number of Fair City actors.

Aviation Challenge offers a taste of military fighter pilot training, including simulations, lectures, and survival exercises. Both camps provide residential and day camp educational programs for children and adults. Exhibits A mock-up display of the Saturn V rocket (scale 1:1) at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center beside the Davidson Center for Space Exploration Some of the rockets in the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. From left to right: Saturn I, Jupiter IRBM, Juno II, Mercury-Redstone, Redstone, and Jupiter-C The U.S. Space & Rocket Center has one of the most extensive collections of space artifacts and displays more than 1500 pieces. Displays include rockets, engines, spacecraft, simulators, and hands-on exhibits. The Space & Rocket Center introduces visitors to U.S. rocketry efforts via both indoor and outdoor displays, from its predecessor at Peenem√ºnde with the German V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, through a progression of U.S. military rockets, such as the Redstone and Jupiter IRBM vehicles, and civilian derivatives such as the Mercury-Redstone and the Juno II, up to the Saturn rocket family civilian rockets, including the vertically displayed Saturn I Block 2 Dynamic Test Vehicle, SA-D5, which has become a famous local landmark, and on to the Space Shuttle. The Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle, SA-500D, the only Saturn V of the three on display to have been brought together outside a museum, is displayed overhead in a new building designed specifically for the rocket named Davidson Center for Space Exploration. The was the first manufactured Space Shuttle Orbiter ‚Äî a mockup made of steel and wood to test facilities for later handling the actual vehicle ‚Äî and it now sits atop an external tank with solid rocket boosters attached. The center showcases significant military rockets, including representatives of the Project Nike series, which formed the first ballistic missile defense, MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missile, Hermes, an early surface-to-surface missile, MGR-1 Honest John and Corporal nuclear missiles and Patriot, first used in the Gulf War of 1991. The F-1 rocket engine stands high, and produces of thrust. The rocketry collection includes numerous engines, as well. In addition to the authentic engines mounted on rockets on display, the museum has unmounted engines on display, including two F-1s, the type of gigantic engine that produced to push Saturn Vs off the launch pad, J-2 engine that powered second and third stages of the Saturn V, and both Descent and Ascent Propulsion System (DPS/APS) engines for the Lunar Module. Engines from the V-2 engine to NERVA to the Space Shuttle Main Engine are on display as well. The Apollo program gets full coverage in the Davidson Center for Space Exploration with artifacts outlining Apollo missions. Astronauts crossed the service structure's red walkway to the White Room, both on display, and climbed in the Command Module atop a Saturn V which was their cabin for the trip to the Moon and back. The Apollo 16 command module, which orbited the Moon 64 times in 1972, is on display.NASA Apollo 16 summary page The Saturn V Instrument Unit controlled five F-1 engines in the first stage of the rocket as it lifted off the pad. Several exhibits relate the complexity and magnitude of that phase of the journey. They took a Lunar Module (mockup on display) to the lunar surface where they collected Moon rocks such as the Apollo 12 specimen at the museum. Later Moon trips took a Lunar Roving Vehicle (displayed beside the LM). The first few Moon trips ended at a Mobile Quarantine Facility (Apollo 12's is on display) where astronauts stayed to ensure containment of any Moon contamination after that mission. The Apollo 16 capsule, which orbited the Moon 64 times in 1972, is displayed with the recovery parachute hanging above it. A restored engineering mock-up of Skylab is also on display, showing the Apollo project's post-lunar efforts. Various simulators help visitors understand the spaceflight experience. Space Shot lets the rider experience launch-like 4 gs and 2‚Äì3 seconds of weightlessness. G-Force Accelerator offers 3 gs of acceleration for an extended period by means of a centrifuge. Several other simulators entertain and educate visitors. Other exhibits offer a hands-on understanding of concepts related to rocketry or space travel. A bell jar demonstrates the reason for using a rocket instead of a propeller in the vacuum of space. A wind tunnel offers visitors the opportunity to manipulate a model to see how forces change with its orientation, and The Mind of Saturn exhibit demonstrates gyroscopic force (necessary for rocket navigation). An Apollo trainer offers visitors the opportunity to climb in. Gemini astronauts trained in this capsule. Some simulators on exhibit were used for astronaut training. A Project Mercury simulator shows the cramped conditions endured by the first Americans in space. A Gemini simulator shows visitors the accommodations when two people flew together to space for the first U.S. missions involving extra- vehicular activities and space rendezvous. Exhibits also cover the future of space flight. Two Orion spacecraft exhibits show the next NASA spacecraft, and a Bigelow Aerospace commercial habitat model details a space tourism effort. =Bus tours= A tour bus waits as tourists inspect the Redstone Test Stand on a 2012 tour of Marshall Space Flight Center. The Space & Rocket Center offers bus tours of Marshall Space Flight Center. The tour offers views of all four National Historic Landmarks at the center including a stop at the landmark Redstone Test Stand, where Alan Shepard's Redstone Rocket was tested prior to launch. Another scheduled stop is the Payload Operations and Integration Center, which serves as mission control for a number of experiments. Bus tours originally started July 4, 1972, but were suspended following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Tours resumed July 20, 2012, the 43rd anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, limited to United States citizens because of security protocol at the Army installation, Redstone Arsenal, which contains Marshall Space Flight Center. =Traveling exhibits= In the summer of 2010, the Space and Rocket Center began hosting traveling exhibits. The first was Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination with other exhibits planned. The United States Space Camp hosted at the facility has provided themed camps in conjunction with the exhibits, including a Jedi Experience camp. Other traveling exhibits include: * The Chronicles of Narnia: The Exhibition Traveling Exhibit * CSI: The Experience Traveling Exhibit * A T-Rex Named Sue and Be the Dinosaur * 100 Years of Von Braun: His American Journey * Mammoths and Mastodons: Titans of the Ice Age Miss Baker gravesite The U.S. Space & Rocket Center is the resting place of Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey who flew on a suborbital test flight of the PGM-19 Jupiter rocket on May 28, 1959. Baker lived in a facility at the Center from 1971 until she died of kidney failure in November 1984. History Visitors to the new museum saw Mercury and Apollo 6 capsules, lunar rovers and lander concepts, and more. The idea for the museum was first proposed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, who led the efforts of the United States to land the first man on the Moon. Plans for the museum were underway in 1960 with an economic feasibility study for the Huntsville-Madison County Chamber of Commerce. Von Braun, understanding the dominance of football in the Alabama culture, persuaded rival Alabama and Auburn coaches Bear Bryant and Shug Jordan to appear in a television commercial supporting a $1.9 million statewide bond referendum to finance museum construction. The referendum passed on November 30, 1965, and a donation of land from the Army's Redstone Arsenal provided a location on which to build. On display immediately were the lunar landscape with lunar lander mockup, and a wide variety of hardware from United States Army Aviation and Missile Command, NASA, and aerospace companies, including a helicopter, and the rocket park. \\"Early blockhouse modern\\" describes the architectural style chosen by Huntsville architect David Crowe for the initial museum building. To help draw tourists from far afield, the center needed a crown jewel. The Huntsville Times reported, Center director \\"Edward O. Buckbee is the type of guy with the tenacity to 'arrange' for this planet's largest, most complex mechanical beast to become a part of the Alabama Space and Rocket Center at Huntsville. / Pulling off the coup ‚Äì getting a Saturn 5 moon rocket here which cost 90 times the center itself ‚Äì was 'a little difficult,' admits Buckbee in a galloping understatement.\\" Buckbee worked with von Braun to see that the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle would be delivered to the site as it was on June 28, 1969. The Saturn I Block 2 Dynamic Test Vehicle which stands erect at the museum was delivered the same day. Initial plans called for visitors to walk through the Saturn V. The center opened on March 17, 1970. The Space & Rocket Center was a \\"major sponsor\\" of the United States pavilion at the 1982 World's Fair, providing exhibits on space and energy as well as equipment and operations for the IMAX theater at the fair. At the time, the Space & Rocket Center also served as the Alabama Energy Information Center. The Spacedome IMAX theater at the museum opened December 19, 1982. The theater closed October 7, 2018, to be converted into a planetarium with high- definition digital projectors opening February 28, 2019. Mike Wing plunged the Center into debt as its executive director from 1998 to 1999. Wing oversaw construction of a full-scale vertical Saturn V replica to be finished at by the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, July 1999. It serves as a towering landmark in Huntsville, and cost the center $8.6 million of borrowed money. The Huntsville Times estimated interest costs at $10 million. Wing also sought to create a program for fifth grade students in Alabama and elsewhere to attend Space Camp at no cost to them. Anonymous corporate pledges that Wing promised would fund the $800 per student never arrived. Wing prolonged the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission's investigation into the pledges by writing bogus personal checks and having the center record them as received. The program ultimately cost the center $7.5 million. Wing was pressured to resign, and several members of the governing Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission were ousted from that board as a result of the debacle. At the end of Wing's term as director, the center was $26 million in debt. The state sued Wing for $7.5 million over the Space Camp fraud. They settled for $500,000. The expenditures would shape more than the next decade for the center. The new board of directors included Larry Capps who was selected to head the museum on February 9, 2000 after Wing. He reduced the debt to $16 million while also building the Davidson Center for Space Exploration and moving the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle into its custom-built facility. Capps was director through his retirement in 2010. Dr. Deborah Barnhart, who headed Space Camp from 1986‚Äì1990, was selected to run the museum in 2010. She has since brought Orion and other post-Shuttle training apparatus to Space Camp and retired the center's line of credit, reducing interest expenditures. The center had about $13 million debt in May 2014. Buildings The SA-500D Saturn V is the centerpiece in the main hall of the Davidson Center for Space Exploration. Front side of the Davidson Center for Space Exploration Huntsville architect David Crowe designed the initial building with of exhibit space. Since 1969, Huntsville residents could point to the vertical Saturn I rocket at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center as a distant landmark (located a few miles from the city center). In 1999, a full-scale model of the Saturn V rocket was erected, standing nearly twice as tall as the Saturn I. Since 1979, a surplus Saturn IB rocket example owned by the museum stands at the Alabama Welcome Center in Ardmore \\"as a reminder to visitors of Alabama's role in the space program.\\" The dome theater addition opened December 19, 1982, to be replaced by a planetarium after a 36-year run. The 1986 film SpaceCamp promoted the camp and inspired more than a doubling of camp attendees (from 5,000 in 1986 to 11,000 in 1987), and the facilities had to be expanded again. A $3 million NASA Educator Resource Center was built during Larry Capps's tenure, opening mid-2005. The newest addition to the U.S. Space & Rocket Center is the Davidson Center for Space Exploration, named after Dr. Julian Davidson, founder of Davidson Technologies.Davidson Technologies Inc. The building opened January 31, 2008. The Davidson Center was designed to house the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and many other space exploration exhibits. The vehicle is elevated above the floor surface with separated stages and engines exposed, so visitors have the opportunity to walk underneath the rocket. The Davidson Center also features a 3D movie theater in addition to the planetarium in the original museum. When the Davidson Center opened in 2008, the museum's ticket center and entrance was relocated to the Davidson Center, so it is now the first exhibit museum visitors experience. This, however, necessitated that visitors enter the original museum through the rear doors, causing it to be viewed out of its original sequence. Governance The U.S. Space & Rocket Center is owned by the State of Alabama and operated by the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission (ASSEC) whose 18 members are appointed by the Governor for terms of four or eight years. The composition and authority of the board are set forth in Title 41, Article 15 of the Code of Alabama. ASSEC meetings are open to the public. The U.S. Space & Rocket Center Foundation is a nonprofit organization that raises funds for the ASSEC.http://www.gospaceeducation.org/foundation Visitors The Space & Rocket Center saw 540,153 visitors in 2010 and 553,137 in 2011, and over 584,000 in 2013, the latter earning the museum recognition as the top paid tourist attraction in Alabama. In 2017, more than 786,820 people visited the center, ranking it first among state attractions that charge admission, according to the Alabama Department of Tourism. The NASA Human Exploration Rover Challenge, previously known as the Great Moonbuggy Race, has run every year since 1994, and all but the first two have been held at the Space & Rocket Center. The race challenges high school and college students to design and build a small moonbuggy that they can assemble on-site and ride across a simulated lunar terrain. In popular culture The U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the setting for feature films SpaceCamp (1986), Beyond the Stars (1989), and Space Warriors (2013), along with the 2012 made- for-TV movie A Smile as Big as the Moon. The U.S. Space & Rocket Center was the site of a Roadblock and Pit Stop at the end of Leg 3 of The Amazing Race: Family Edition aired in October 2005. Good Morning America has featured the Space & Rocket Center multiple times. In their 2006 proclamation the \\"Seven wonders of America\\", GMA selected the Saturn V and particularly featured the Saturn V Dynamic Test Vehicle at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center.

He was one of the first of the blues musicians active in the 1920s to be brought out of retirement and given new opportunities to record during the folk blues revival of the 1960s. Life and career Lewis was born in Greenwood, Mississippi. His birth year is uncertain. Many sources give 1893, the date he gave in his later years, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1899, based on his 1900 census entry, and other sources suggest 1895 or 1898. His family moved to Memphis when he was seven. He acquired the nickname \\"Furry\\" from childhood playmates. By 1908, he was playing solo at parties, in taverns, and on the street. He was also invited to play several dates with W. C. Handy's Orchestra. In his travels as a musician, he was exposed to a wide variety of performers, including Bessie Smith, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Alger \\"Texas\\" Alexander. Like his contemporary Frank Stokes, he grew tired of traveling and took a permanent job in 1922. His position as a street sweeper for the city of Memphis, a job he held until his retirement in 1966, allowed him to continue performing music in Memphis. Lewis made his first recordings for Vocalion Records in Chicago in 1927. A year later he recorded for Victor Records at the Memphis Auditorium, in a session with the Memphis Jug Band, Jim Jackson, Frank Stokes, and others. He again recorded for Vocalion in Memphis in 1929. The tracks were mostly blues but included two- part versions of \\"Casey Jones\\" and \\"John Henry\\". He sometimes fingerpicked and sometimes played with a slide. He made many successful records in the late 1920s, including \\"Kassie Jones\\", \\"Billy Lyons & Stack-O-Lee\\" and \\"Judge Harsh Blues\\" (later called \\"Good Morning Judge\\"). In July 1968, Bob West recorded Furry along with Bukka White in Furry's Memphis apartment. In 1972 West, with Bob Graf, in Seattle, released the recording on a 12-inch vinyl record. In 2001 the recording was released on CD as \\"Furry Lewis, Bukka White & Friends, Party! at Home\\", by Arcola Records. In 1969, the record producer Terry Manning recorded Lewis in his Fourth Street apartment in Memphis, near Beale Street. These recordings were released in Europe at the time by Barclay Records and again in the early 1990s by Lucky Seven Records in the United States and in 2006 by Universal Records. In 1972 he was the featured performer in the Memphis Blues Caravan, which included Bukka White, Sleepy John Estes, Clarence Nelson, Hammie Nixon, Memphis Piano Red, Sam Chatmon, and Mose Vinson. He opened twice for the Rolling Stones, performed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, had a part in a Burt Reynolds movie (W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings, 1975), and was profiled in Playboy magazine. Joni Mitchell's song \\"Furry Sings the Blues\\" (on her album Hejira), is about her visit to Lewis's apartment and a mostly ruined Beale Street on February 5, 1976. Lewis despised the Mitchell song and felt she should pay him royalties for being its subject. \\"Furry Lewis\\", by Greg Johnson - Article Reprint from the July 2001 BluesNotes, via Cascade Blues Association Lewis began to lose his eyesight because of cataracts in his final years.

Ashley. The Ashley Book of Knots. Doubleday, 1944. p.306. is a simple adjustable knot, commonly used by climbers, cavers, and rescuers to control friction in a life-lining or belay system. To climbers, this knot is also known as HMS, the abbreviation for the German term Halbmastwurfsicherung, meaning half clove hitch belay. This technique can be used with a special \\"pear-shaped\\" HMS locking carabiner, or any locking carabiner wide enough to take two turns of the rope. The Munter hitch is named after Werner Munter, a Swiss mountain guide who popularised its use in mountaineering. The hitch is simply a set of wraps using a rope or cord around an object, generally a round object like a pipe, pole or more commonly, a carabiner. Its main use is as a friction device for controlling the rate of descent in belay systems. Method of operation The Munter hitch creates friction by having the rope rub on itself and on the object it has been wrapped around. There is no localized abrasion on any part of the rope as it is a continuously moving hitch. One very useful aspect of the Munter is its reversibility; it can be pulled from either side of the rope and it still works just as effectively. The Munter hitch is a self regulating hitch. The heavier the load the tighter the bends in the hitch become and therefore creating more friction and self regulating. Use for rappeling This hitch can be used to rappel or abseil down a vertical or semi vertical wall although it is not recommended as it causes severe twisting of the rope. When using the Munter hitch to rappel make sure to get proper training before using the hitch. Using this method to rappel is very hard on rope because of the rope on rope contact and is generally considered an emergency option only. =Use as load releasable tie off= As with most belay devices and some hitches the Munter can be tied off (dogged/dogged off) to maintain tension in a manner which is easily released under tension, this is often referred to as a Munter-Mule-Overhand or MMO (Munter Mule Overhand) The control rope (the rope not going to the load) is tied to the load rope with a Mule Knot (aka Halter hitch) - not a slipped overhand! - and the bight (loop) that sticks out is tied in an overhand around the load rope. A carabiner is then sometimes clipped through the end of the bight and around the load rope. Examples of when a tie off would be employed include: * tensioning the line for use as a track line * fall restraint line * restraining/guying purposes. When a belayer needs to transfer the load from his harness to the anchor to escape the system: a rope grab (mechanical or friction knot/Prusik) is placed on the load line towards the load, rope is terminated on the rope grab (or the tails of accessory cord are used when using a cordelette with a Prusik as a rope grab) and runs back to the anchor where a Munter mule is tied under tension. The load can then be lowered (transferred) from the original belay onto the Munter Mule via the rope grab. The new line is often consider independent of the safety system so the original belay needs to be maintained throughout the process and secured back to the anchor before the system can be left unattended.  Use as a belay  A belay system incorporating the Munter hitch is the same as any other belay system, which incorporates a belayer to tend the rope and an anchor, which secures the belay system and belayer. There are several advantages to the Munter hitch. It requires no additional hardware other than a carabiner. It's also the most common belay system which locks with the brake hand in line with the load, and as such is a more suitable method for direct belays than using a normal belay plate.S. Long, The Climbing Handbook, 64 This can be useful when the anchor, carabiner and Munter hitch are above or behind the belayer whilst attention is paid to the loaded end of the rope. It can also more effectively dissipate heat than a belay device because no two surfaces of the rope are in contact with each other for more than an instant. However, it places more bends in a rope than other belay methods, and creates significantly more friction on the outer sheath. Another disadvantage is that it can introduce significant twists to the rope. It is a versatile knot to know and can be used for full rope length vertical descents without the need for gloves. The friction of the rope against the screw on the carabiner can cause the screw to undo and the carabiner to open, potentially weakening the strength of the carabiner, or allowing the rope to escape the carabiner completely. Military use The Munter hitch is taught on Australian military roping courses as a simple and effective method for descending steep or overhanging terrain with combat equipment and can also be used for lowering heavy stores or casualties, the only equipment required being a harness or webbing seat, a locking carabiner, and a rope. Arboreal usage For the recreational tree climber or working arborist, the Munter is useful to know as a reliable lowering knot for moderate loads. This hitch performs well on both 16 strand arborist climbing lines and the 11 mm double braid lines like Blaze and Velocity. Tower technicians Tower technicians also use this knot for lowering loads, and tagging heavy loads while hoisting. It is commonly referred to in the tower industry as a tag knot.

The university is home of the Eddie G. Robinson Museum and is listed on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. The university is a member-school of the University of Louisiana System. Grambling State's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Grambling State Tigers. The university is a member of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). History Bust of Charles P. Adams, the founder and first president of Grambling State University Grambling State was founded in 1901 and accredited in 1949. The school became Grambling College in 1946, named after Judson H. Grambling, a white sawmill owner who donated a parcel of land for construction of the school. Grambling State University developed from the desire of African- American farmers in rural north Louisiana who wanted to educate other African Americans in the northern part of the state. In 1896, the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association led by Lafayette Richmond was formed to organize and operate a school. After opening a small school west of what is now the town of Grambling, the Association requested assistance from Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Charles P. Adams, sent to aid the group in organizing an industrial school, became its founder and first president. Under Adams' leadership, the Colored Industrial and Agricultural School opened on November 1, 1901. Four years later, the school moved to its present location and was renamed as the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School. By 1928, the school was able to offer two-year professional certificates and diplomas after becoming a state junior college. The school was renamed Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute. In 1936, the program was reorganized to emphasize rural education. It became known as \\"The Louisiana Plan\\" or \\"A Venture in Rural Teacher Education.\\" Professional teaching certificates were awarded when a third year was added in 1936, and the first baccalaureate degree was awarded in 1944 in elementary education. The institution's name was changed to Grambling College in 1946 in honor of a white sawmill owner, P.G. Grambling, who donated a parcel of land for the school. Thereafter, the college prepared secondary teachers and added curricula in sciences, liberal arts and business. With these programs in effect, the school was transformed from a single purpose institution of teacher education into a multi-purpose college. In 1949, the college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The Grambling science building is one of twenty-six public structures in Louisiana constructed by prominent contractor George A. Caldwell, who completed major public buildings throughout the state. In 1974, the addition of graduate programs in early childhood and elementary education qualified the school as a university; it was called Grambling State University. From 1977 to 2000, the university grew and prospered. Several new academic programs were incorporated. New facilities were added to the campus, including a business and computer science building, school of nursing, student services building, stadium, stadium support facility, and an intramural sports center. State Representative George B. Holstead of Ruston, whose grandfather had been instrumental in the founding of Louisiana Tech, worked to increase state appropriations for both Louisiana Tech and Grambling State University during his legislative tenure from 1964-1980. On December 7, 2010, the Grambling State University Historic District, an area comprising 16 buildings dating from 1939 to 1960, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. with 16 photos and two maps In 2019, Grambling broke ground for building of the first digital library on a HBCU campus and first for a Louisiana collegiate institution.

Adams, Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones became the second president and the highly successful baseball coach from 1936 until his retirement in 1977. Five presidents served from 1977 to 2001: Dr. Joseph Benjamin Johnson, Dr. Harold W. Lundy, Dr. Raymond Hicks, Dr. Leonard Haynes III, and Dr. Steve A. Favors. Dr. Neari Francois Warner was selected as the university's first female president, when she served a three-year interim term.

History Commercial diving support vessels emerged during the 1960s and 1970s, when the need arose for offshore diving operations to be performed below and around oil production platforms and associated installations in open water in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Until that point, most diving operations were from mobile oil drilling platforms, pipe-lay, or crane barges. The diving system tended to be modularised and craned on and off the vessels as a package. As permanent oil and gas production platforms emerged, the owners and operators were not keen to give over valuable deck space to diving systems because after they came on-line the expectation of continuing diving operations was low. However, equipment fails or gets damaged, and there was a regular if not continuous need for diving operations in and around oil fields. The solution was to put diving packages on ships. Initially these tended to be oilfield supply ships or fishing vessels; however, keeping this kind of ship 'on station', particularly during uncertain weather, made the diving dangerous, problematic and seasonal. Furthermore, seabed operations usually entailed the raising and lowering of heavy equipment, and most such vessels were not equipped for this task. This is when the dedicated commercial diving support vessel emerged. These were often built from scratch or heavily converted pipe carriers or other utility ships. The key components of the diving support vessel are: *Dynamic Positioning ‚Äì Controlled by a computer with input from position reference systems (DGPS, Transponders, Light Taut Wires or RadaScan), it will maintain the ship's position over a dive site by using multi-directional thrusters, other sensors would compensate for swell, tide and prevailing wind. *Saturation diving system ‚Äì For diving operations below 50 m, a mixture of helium and oxygen (heliox) is required to eliminate the narcotic effect of nitrogen under pressure. For extended diving operations at depth, saturation diving is the preferred approach. A saturation system would be installed within the ship. A diving bell would transport the divers between the saturation system and the work site lowered through a 'moon pool' in the bottom of the ship, usually with a support structure 'cursor' to support the diving bell through the turbulent waters near the surface. There are a number of support systems for the saturation system on a diving support vessel, usually including a remotely operated vehicle ROV and heavy lifting equipment. =Modern diving support vessels= The 2015 launched DSV Curtis Marshall Most of the vessels currently in the North Sea have been built in the 1980s. The semi-submersible fleet, the Uncle John and similar, have proven to be too expensive to maintain and too slow to move between fields. Therefore, most existing designs are monohull vessels with either a one or a twin bell dive system. There has been little innovation since the 1980s. However, driven by high oil prices since 2004, the market for subsea developments in the North Sea has grown significantly. This has led to a scarcity of diving support vessels and has driven the price up. Thus, contractors have ordered a number of newbuild vessels which are expected to enter the market in 2008. These vessels are built and designed nowadays not only to support diving activities, but they also support remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) operations with dedicated hangar and LARS for ROV's, support seismic survey operations, support cable-laying operations, etc. Owing to these nature of the modern-day vessels, they may have at any time 80 to 150 project personnel on board, including divers, diving supervisors and superintendents, dive technicians, life support technicians and supervisors, ROV pilots, ROV superintendents, survey team, clients personnel, etc. For all these personnel to carry out their contracted job with an oil and gas company, a professional crew navigate and operate the vessel as per the requirements and instructions of the diving or ROV or survey team superintendents. However, ultimate responsibility lies on the master of the vessel for the safety of every person on board. In expanding the utility of the vessel, just like liveaboard dive boats, these vessels in addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the vessel will have specialised mix gas diving compressors and reclaim systems, gas storage and gas blending facilities, as well as purpose-built saturation chambers where the divers in compression live. These vessels are designed to be hired by diving service providing companies or directly by oil and gas contractors who then will also hire a diving or ROV or survey service- providing company, which will then utilize the vessel as platform to carry out their activities. Diving from a DSV Diving from a DSV makes a wider range of operations possible, but the platform presents some inherent hazards, and equipment and procedures must be adopted to manage these hazards as well as the hazards of the environment and diving tasks. =Hazards= * Hazards of the positioning system ** Anchor patterns ** Thrusters =Equipment= * On board recompression facilities * Equipment to transport the diver through high risk zones * Equipment to limit access to known hazards * Hyperbaric evacuation facilities =Procedures= * Use of stages and bells to transport the diver through the interface between air and water * Surface-supplied diving with limited umbilical length * Underwater umbilical tending See also     References  External links Diving support equipment Ship types ","title":"Diving support vessel"},{"id":"989005","text":"Thor Power Tool Company v. Commissioner, 439 U.S. 522 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld IRS regulations limiting how taxpayers could write down inventory. Thor manufactured equipment using multiple parts that it produced. It capitalized the costs of these parts when produced. When it had inventories of parts in excess of production needs, the company's accounting practice was to write down those inventories, taking a loss based on management judgment. However, IRS regulations accepted this \\"lower of cost or market\\" method for tax purposes only if the taxpayer could demonstrate a reduced market price, or the goods were defective or \\"subnormal\\". It did not permit companies to write down goods simply because they were not selling them.Pratt & Kulsrud, Federal Taxation, 2006, p. 10-33. . In court, the company argued that its deduction for loss should be allowed for tax purposes because it was permitted for accounting purposes. But the Court upheld the IRS regulations, saying, \\"There is no presumption that an inventory practice conformable to 'generally accepted accounting principles' is valid for tax purposes. Such a presumption is insupportable in light of the statute, this Court's past decisions, and the differing objectives of tax and financial accounting.\\" Effects The Thor decision caused publishers and booksellers to be much quicker to destroy stocks of poorly-selling books in order to realize a taxable loss.

Also a teacher, libertarian and social activist by occupation, she assumed the office of Defence Production Minister on 20 August 2018. After successfully contesting in general elections held in 2002 on a PML(Q) platform, she came in national prominence and public fame as a leading woman minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. From 2002‚Äì07, she was the minister of Minister of Education (MoEd) and unsuccessfully contested for general elections held in 2008 on a PML(Q) platform. After a five-year brief break from the national politics, she joined the Pakistan Muslim League and but stepped down in favour of Kiran Haider who successfully retained her seat in 2013 general elections, although she retains herself as a woman leader of the Pakistan Muslim League. Social and political activism =Teachings and services to education= After returning from Kuwait, she helped established a school for girls in her village with the support of her father because in that time in such traditional conservative Baloch society did not allowed women to go to schools. While teaching at school, she also taught English literature at the Balochistan University. In 1993, her services were recognised by the Government of Pakistan and honoured her with Pride of Performance Award for Education by the President of Pakistan. She has authored many publications include Papers on Baloch Embroidery and Poverty alleviation. Her political activism started after joining the centre-right Pakistan Muslim League (PML) led by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1988; but defected to dissident group in 2000. She successfully contested in general elections held in 2002, securing 44,177 voted from her NA‚Äì27 constituency. In 2002, she was appointed as the minister of Minister of Education (MoEd) and took oath from President Pervez Musharraf as part of the Prime Minister Zafarullah Jamali's cabinet. She would later given extension and would continue served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. =Education ministry= In 2004, Zubaida Jalal announced that \\"all religious seminaries will now be involved in all mainstream education programmes.\\" Approved by President Pervez Musharraf, the programme was in making the madrassa (seminaries) integrated with modern education reforms. Jalal personally had approved the ‚Ç®. 225‚Äì500 million from the government for 2003‚Äì04; all funding were jointly released by the US AID. Reforms were set to be carried out to change the school curriculum and many revival updates, deregulation of the textbooks were part of the program which was oversaw by the Zubaida Jalal. Despite initiation and modernisation, the programme did not moved an inch, according to the media reports. The education ministry did not made no movement on seminary reforms and registration, with no related meetings scheduled and new no policy guidelines issued to government departments. In a media report published by Daily Times, the Education ministry failed in making the madrassa (seminaries) reforms successful in 2004. They asked the government to reopen madrassa registration for more people to benefit from the Madrassa Reforms Package. Approximately, ‚Ç®. 6 billion were set-aside for the reforms' first three years and the government gave an additional ‚Ç®. 225 million to four provinces, but the provinces failed to use the funds. According to the officials worked under Zubaida Jalal's administration confirmed that no new policy on madrassa reforms had been prepared and the old policy was still intact. In 2009, educationist, Saleem Ali wrote a thesis in his book, \\"Islam and Education: Conflict and Conformity in Pakistan‚Äôs Madrassas\\", that \\" indeed all private and public schools, are still subject to government approval, whereas the madrassa programmes at present have no government oversight.\\" The government's inability to impose the program and lack of interest in topics further diminished. The powerful clerics threatened the government upon which the federal education minister Zubaida Jalal immediately clarified that no chapter or verses relating to jihad or Holy War or shahadat (martyrdom) had been deleted from textbook and that the particular verse referring to jihad had only been shifted from the biology textbook for intermediate students. According to the Education ministry, the major reason for this failure was the view of the madrassas that the project was part of an American agenda. Others maintained that there were \\"high level interests\\" which had hampered the process. Furthermore, majority of the funds were lost during a tug of war between the Interior ministry, Religious ministry and Education ministry which Zubaida Jalal led. This squabble was eventually resolved by a personal intervention of President Pervez Musharraf in 2007. =2008 general election campaign= In 2008, Jalal decided not to obtain the PML(Q) ticket, and instead contested in 2008 general elections as an independent candidate, from the NA‚Äì272 constituency. She lost the 2008 general election while securing only 33,564 votes and losing to Yaqoob Bizanjo of Balochistan National Party (Awami). =2013 general election campaign= In 2013, Zubaida Jalal endorsed PML(N) candidate Nawaz Sharif's bid for premiership. In a meeting with Nawaz Sharif, Jalal announced to join the PML-N, reposing full confidence in the leadership of Nawaz Sharif. Zubaida Jalal Joined BAP and successfully contested the elections. Following the PTI government coalition with BAP she was inducted into the federal cabinet of Imran Imran Khan as Minister for Defence Production. Personal life =Political controversies= Soon after the general elections in 2008, the FIA launched an investigation on Zubaida Jalal over the financial scam. The FIA investigations were launched under the directives of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani who felt that \\"the role of the minister of that time Zubaida Jalal needs to be investigated without which the objectives of the whole exercise will remain unmet.\\" Zubaida Jalal has strongly denied the allegations of corruption against her. In 2009, the FIA investigations were wrapped In 2010 publications edited by Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDT), Zubaida Jalal is a second richest politician from Balochistan, having declared the total assets worth ‚Ç®. 57.87 million. =Political philosophy= Zubaida Jalal was touted as General Pervez Musharraf's most enlightened face and was one of the notable minister under Musharraf's regime. In 2008, she publicly endorsed the support for President Pervez Musharraf during the times of impeachment movement was in effect against the former president. In a television interview, Zubaida Jalal said that as a bold and brave leader, Pervez Musharraf will live in Pakistan and for Pakistan. While talking to APP this afternoon after the Pervez Musharraf announced his resignation, Begum Jalal said that to the extent she knows Musharraf, he is not likely to leave the field empty but will continue his struggle for an enlightened, peaceful and progressive Pakistan.

A population pyramid, also called an \\"age-gender-pyramid\\", is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population (typically that of a country or region of the world), which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured by raw number or as a percentage of the total population. This tool can be used to visualize the age of a particular population. It is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population; an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species. Structure Population pyramids often contain continuous stacked-histogram bars, making it a horizontal bar diagram. The population size is depicted on the x-axis (horizontal) while the age-groups are represented on the y-axis (vertical). The size of the population can either be measured as a percentage of the total population or by raw number. Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right. Population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and distribution of a population, partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent.Department of Health Home A great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid, and this can shed light on the extent of development and other aspects of the population. The measures of central tendency, mean, median, and mode, should be considered when assessing a population pyramid. since the data is not completely accurate. For example, the average age could be used to determine the type of population in a particular region. A population with an average age of 15 would have a young population compared to a population that has an average age of 55, which would be considered an older population. It is also important to consider these measures because the collected data is not completely accurate. The mid-year population is often used in calculations to account for the number of births and deaths that occur. A population pyramid gives a clear picture of how a country transitions from high fertility to low fertility rate. The broad base of the pyramid means a relative majority of the population lies between ages 0‚Äì14, which tells us that the fertility rate of the country is high and above population sub-replacement fertility level. The older population is declining over time due to a shorter life expectancy of sixty years. However, there are still more females than males in these ranges since women have a longer life expectancy. As reported by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, women tend to live longer than men because women do not partake in risky behaviors. Also, Weeks' Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues, considered that the sex ratio gap for the older ages will shrink due to women's health declining due to the effects of smoking, as suggested by the United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau. Moreover, it can also reveal the age- dependency ratio of a population. Populations with a big base, young population, or a big top, an older population, shows that there is a higher dependency ratio. The dependency ratio refers to how many people are dependent on the working class (ages 15‚Äì64). According to Weeks' Population: an Introduction to Concepts and Issues, population pyramids can be used to predict the future, known as a population forecast. Population momentum, when a population's birth rates continue to increase even after replacement level has been reached, can even be predicted if a population has a low mortality rate since the population will continue to grow. This then brings up the term doubling time, which is used to predict when the population will double in size. Lastly, a population pyramid can even give insight on the economic status of a country from the age stratification since the distribution of supplies are not evenly distributed through a population. In the demographic transition model, the size and shape of population pyramids vary. In stage one of the demographic transition model, the pyramids have the most defined shape. They have the ideal big base and a skinny top. In stage two, the pyramid looks similar, but starts to widen in the middle age groups. In stage three, the pyramids start to round out and look similar in shape to a tombstone. In stage four, there is a decrease in the younger age groups. This causes the base of the widened pyramid to narrow. Lastly, in stage five, the pyramid starts to take on the shape of a kite as the base continues to decrease. The shape of the population is dependent upon what the economy is like in the country. More developed countries can be found in stages three four and five while the least developed countries have a population represented by the pyramids in stages one and two. Types Each country will have different or unique population pyramids. However, population pyramids will be defined as the following: stationary, expansive, or constrictive. These types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country.Population Pyramids - Oregon State University ;\\"Stationary\\" pyramid :A pyramid can be described as stationary if the percentages of population (age and sex) remains constant over time. Stationary population is when a population contains equal birth rates and death rates. ;\\"Expansive\\" pyramid :A population pyramid that is very wide at the younger ages, characteristic of countries with high birth rate and low life expectancy. The population is said to be fast-growing, and the size of each birth cohort gets larger than the size of the previous year. ;\\"Constrictive\\" pyramid :A population pyramid that is narrowed at the bottom. The population is generally older on average, as the country has long life expectancy, a low death rate, but also a low birth rate. However, the percentage of younger population are extremely low, this can cause issues with dependency ratio of the population. This pyramid is more common when immigrants are factored out. This is a typical pattern for a very developed country, a high level of education, easy access to and incentive to use birth control, good health care, and few negative environmental factors. : : Youth bulge Median age by country. A youth bulge is evident for Africa, and to a lesser extent for West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America. Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau Gary Fuller (1995) described Youth bulge as a type of expansive pyramid. Gunnar Heinsohn (2003) argues that an excess in especially young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest, war and terrorism, as the \\"third and fourth sons\\" that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology. Heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers (such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment) and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge. This factor has been also used to account for the Arab Spring events.Korotayev A. et al.A Trap At The Escape From The Trap? Demographic-Structural Factors of Political Instability in Modern Africa and West Asia. Cliodynamics 2/2 (2011): 1-28. Economic recessions, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and the late 2000s recession, are also claimed to be explained in part due to a large youth population who cannot find jobs. Youth bulge can be seen as one factor among many in explaining social unrest and uprisings in society. A 2016 study finds that youth bulges increases the chances of non-ethnic civil wars, but not ethnic civil wars. A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough ‚Äì in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16‚Äì29 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males. In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.Huntington, Samuel P. 1996.

Today, the nearly 111 million individuals aging between 15 to 29 living across the region make up nearly 27 percent of the region‚Äôs population.\\" Structural changes in service provision, especially health care, beginning in the 1960s created the conditions for a demographic explosion, which has resulted in a population consisting primarily of younger people. It is estimated that around 65% of the regional population is under the age of 25. The Middle East has invested more in education, including religious education, than most other regions such that education is available to most children. However, that education has not led to higher levels of employment, and youth unemployment is currently at 25%, the highest of any single region. Of this 25%, over half are first time entrants into the job market. The youth bulge in the Middle East and North Africa has been favorably compared to that of East Asia, which harnessed this human capital and saw huge economic growth in recent decades. The youth bulge has been referred to by the Middle East Youth Initiative as a demographic gift, which, if engaged, could fuel regional economic growth and development. \\"While the growth of the youth population imposes supply pressures on education systems and labor markets, it also means that a growing share of the overall population is made up of those considered to be of working age; and thus not dependent on the economic activity of others. In turn, this declining dependency ratio can have a positive impact on overall economic growth, creating a demographic dividend. The ability of a particular economy to harness this dividend, however, is dependent on its ability to ensure the deployment of this growing working-age population towards productive economic activity, and to create the jobs necessary for the growing labor force.\\" See also *Age class structure *Baby boom *Demographic analysis *Demographic transition *List of countries by median age *Middle East Youth Initiative *Overpopulation *Political demography *Population *Population growth *Sex ratio *Waithood References = Citations = =Additional references= * U.S. Census Bureau, Demographic Internet Staff (June 27, 2011). \\"International Programs, International Data Base\\".

Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked him as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth. Biography =Early life= James Jerome Gibson was born in McConnelsville, Ohio, on January 27, 1904, to Thomas and Gertrude Gibson. He was the oldest of three children and had two younger brothers, Thomas and William. Gibson's father worked for Wisconsin Central Railroad, and his mother was a schoolteacher. Because his father worked on the railroad, Gibson and his family had to travel and relocate quite frequently, moving throughout the Dakotas and Wisconsin until they finally settled down in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette. When Gibson was a boy, his father would take him out on train rides. Gibson recalled being absolutely fascinated by the way the visual world would appear when in motion. In the direction of the train, the visual world would appear to flow in the same direction and expand. When Gibson looked behind the train, the visual world would seem to contract. These experiences sparked Gibson's interest in optic flow and the visual information generated from different modes of transportation. Later in life, Gibson would apply this fascination to the study of visual perception of landing and flying planes. =Education and career= Gibson began his undergraduate career at Northwestern University, but transferred after his freshman year to Princeton University, where he majored in philosophy. While enrolled at Princeton, Gibson had many influential professors including Edwin B. Holt who advocated new realism, and Herbert S. Langfeld who had taught Gibson's experimental psychology course. After taking Langfeld's course, Gibson decided to stay at Princeton as a graduate student and pursued his Ph.D. in psychology with Langfeld serving as his doctoral adviser. His doctoral dissertation focused on memory of visual forms, and he received his Ph.D. in 1928. E. B. Holt, who was taught by William James, inspired Gibson to be a radical empiricist. Holt was a mentor to Gibson. While Gibson may not have directly read William James‚Äô work, E. B. Holt was the connecting factor between the two. Holt‚Äôs theory of molar behaviorism brought James philosophy of radical empiricism into psychology. Heft argues that Gibson‚Äôs work was an application of William James‚Äô. Gibson believed that perception is direct and meaningful. He discussed the meaning of perception through his theory of affordances. Gibson also was influenced by James' neutral monism, nothing is solely mental or physical. Gibson started his career at Smith College where he taught psychology. While at Smith, Gibson encountered two influential figures in his life, one of which was the Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka. Although Gibson did not agree with Gestalt psychology, he nevertheless agreed with Koffka's belief that the primary investigations of psychology should be problems related to perception. The other important figure Gibson met during his time at Smith College was his wife, Eleanor Jack, who became a prominent psychologist known for her investigations such as the \\"visual cliff.\\" The two were married on September 17, 1932, and later had two children, James Jerome Jr. in 1940 and Jean Grier in 1943. In 1941, Gibson entered the U.S. Army, where he became the director of a unit for the Army Air Forces' Aviation Psychology Program during World War II. Of particular interest to him was the effect flying an aircraft had on visual perception. He used his findings to help develop visual aptitude tests for screening out pilot applicants. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946. After the war ended, he returned to Smith College for a short period during which he began writing his first book, The Perception of the Visual World, in which he discussed visual phenomena such as retinal texture gradient and retinal motion gradient. Before the book was published in 1950, Gibson moved to Cornell University where he continued to teach and conduct research for the rest of his life. =Honors and awards= After publication of his book in 1950, Gibson won the Warren Medal as a member of the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 1952. He also became a division president for the American Psychological Association (APA) and for the Eastern Psychological Association. Among many of Gibson's other honors were receiving the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award in 1961, becoming a Fulbright fellow at Oxford University, a fellow of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University, and a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University. Gibson was elected into the National Academy of Sciences in 1967. Gibson received honorary doctorates by Edinburgh and Uppsala Universities. Gibson died in Ithaca, New York on December 11, 1979. He was 75 years old. Major contributions and works =Gibson's approach to visual perception= The question driving Gibson's research on perception was \\"how do we see the world as we do?\\". This instigated his empirical research, the environment, and how the individual experiences said environment. There were two primary ways in which James J. Gibson reformed the way psychology views perception. The first is that the templates of our stimulation are affected by a moving organism. This was shown through his research on optic arrays. Secondly, he formulated the idea of three-dimensional space being conceptual. To Gibson, perception is a compilation of the person's environment and how the person interacts with it. James Gibson's major contributions throughout his career were published in three of his major works: The Perception of the Visual World (1950), The Sense Considered as Perceptual Systems (1966), and The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1979). Much of Gibson's work on perception derives from his time spent in the U.S. Army Air Force. Here, he delved into thoughts on how imperative perception is on daily functions. His work may be the first to show a distinct difference between types of perception. Form perception, on one hand, is a display of two static displays, whereas object perception, involves one of the displays to be in motion. Gibson laid down the base for empirical perception research throughout his lifetime. He did work on adaptation and inspection of curved lines, which became a precursor for perceptual research later. His basic work rejected the perspective that perception in and of itself is meaningless, he instead argued meaning is independent of the perceiver. He claimed that the environment decides perception, and that meaning is in what the environment \\"affords\\" the observer. =Major works= In his classic work The Perception of the Visual World (1950) he rejected the then fashionable theory of behaviorism for a view based on his own experimental work, which pioneered the idea that animals 'sampled' information from the 'ambient' outside world. He studied the concept of optical flow (later published as part of his theory of affordance). According to Gibson, one determines the optical flow (which can be described as the apparent flow of the movement of objects in the visual field relative to the observer) using the pattern of light on the retina. The term 'affordance' refers to the opportunities for action provided by a particular object or environment. This concept has been extremely influential in the field of design and ergonomics: see for example the work of Donald Norman who interacted with Gibson and who adapted Gibson's idea of affordances (with significant conceptual amendments) to industrial design. In his later work (such as, for example, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1979)), Gibson became more philosophical and criticised cognitivism in the same way he had attacked behaviorism before. Gibson argued strongly in favour of direct perception and direct realism (as pioneered by the Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid), as opposed to cognitivist indirect realism. He termed his new approach ecological psychology. He also rejected the information processing view of cognition. Gibson is increasingly influential on many contemporary movements in psychology, particularly those considered to be post-cognitivist. One of the most impotant statements in this book is that Gibson maintains that the optical information of an image is not an impression of form and color, but rather of invariants. A fixated form of an object only specifies certain invariants of the object, not its solid form. (p. 227) Gibson did work on perception with his wife, Eleanor J Gibson. Together they proposed perceptual learning as a process of seeing the differences in the perceptual field around an individual. An early example of this is the classic research study done by Eleanor Gibson and R. D. Walk, the visual cliff experiment. In this experiment an infant that was new to crawling was found to be sensitive to depth of an edge. =Ecology and perception= Gibson believed that the environment and animals are not separable items. He stated that without the environment animals cannot survive and without animals there is no environment. The environment is what we perceive at any given moment. All animals are able to perceive. Humans perceive the environment directly. This is why we are unable to perceive things in the environment that are too small to see, such as an atom. =Affordances= Gibson coined the noun affordance. For Gibson the noun affordance pertains to the environment providing the opportunity for action. Affordances require a relationship in which the environment and the animal can work together. An example is that mankind has changed the environment to better suit our needs. When coming across Earth's natural steep slopes, man designed stairs in order to afford walking. In addition, objects in the environment can also afford many different behaviors, such as lifting or grasping. Gibson argued that when we perceive an object we observe the object's affordances and not its particular qualities. He believed that perceiving affordances of an object is easier than perceiving the many different qualities an object may have. Affordances can be related to different areas of the habitat as well. Some areas of the world allow for concealing while some allow for foraging. =Social affordances= He expanded on the affordance theory to include social affordances. He believed affordances were important to understanding social behaviors. Our behavior depends on what we perceive the other person intentions to be. It is not about the behavior itself but how we perceived their behavior. This is how misconceptions occur, we misinterpret another individual's behavior. Gibson stated that behavior affords behavior. Therefore, if someone is being nice to you then this affords a nice reaction. This can be applied to why humans get married or form friendships. Legacy James J. Gibson left a lasting impact on the way that psychologists and philosophers conceptualize perception and action. He rejected the behaviorists' assumptions that learning involves the formation of associations between stimuli and responses, adopting instead a holistic view related to that of the Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka with whom he had contact. He argued that the perceived environment is not composed by stitching together such elements as shapes and edges, but rather that the world is made up of meaningful features that are experienced continuously as wholes. He will perhaps be best remembered for his theory of affordances, which some theorists have suggested provides a fundamental way to understand the duality of mind and external reality. Previous theories of sensory meaning have argued that perceptions are separate and private from one another. This stance placed all of the perceptive meaning on the individual, which meant there was no way to find common ground on individuals' shared experiences. Gibson contended that when stimulus information is being sought out, meaningful properties of that stimulus are also perceived relationally. For instance, a softball affords \\"throwing\\" if the observer notices that the ball fits well in a person's hand, and that the weight allows it to be thrown. The training of aviators is a practical application of Gibson's views, which such suggest that training should be as realistic and unconstrained as possible. Gibson's work indicates the interactivity of observers and the natural environment, and has been dubbed ecological psychology as a result. Gibson also argued that perceptual experimenters were misguided in their control over physical variables of stimuli, and the display of stimulus information should be manipulated instead. This stance breaks from traditional thought in that Gibson posited that fundamentally sound experiments could be conducted in the external world without having to construct artificial laboratory settings.

Medway Elementary is the primary center of education for grades k-5.  History  =European Discovery and the Founding of a Settlement (1671-1771)= When European explorers, namely French fur traders, reached the Mad River in 1671, they found an abundance of beaver pelt among other prized furs. They followed the Honey Creek, through the current locations of the town of Medway where they established a small base camp (later moved to a Shawnee trading post near present-day Springfield, Ohio). On September 17, 1671, the Spangler party claimed all the lands comprising the drainage basin of the river, later renamed the Mad River, for Louis XIV as part of New France. During the 1740s, the Wood's River Land Company, which was represented by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne, attained a large tract of land within present-day southwest Ohio. Part of the tract became Clark County and Montgomery County and was sold to settlers entering the region. The Drapier and Ingles families were among those that built their homes somewhere between present locations of Medway and the subdivision of Park Layne. The settlement came to be called Drapier's Meadow by 1748. Seven years later, the Ohio Valley was involved in the brutality of the French and Indian War. This war resulted in British control over much of France's North American holdings, including the Mad River fur trading posts located in present-day Medway. By the end of the war, the French had retreated and the Shawnee Amerindians gained control over the post. They subsequently moved to Springfield where the tribe already had a large settlement.Lower Valley: A Brief Early History[Battle of Piqua-George Rogers Clark Park, 2002 OHS] =George Rogers Clark and American Revolution (1772-1797)= Medway played a notable role as part of the western campaign during the American Revolutionary War. General George Rogers Clark, led over 1,000 soldiers (among them Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton) across the Ohio River near present-day Cincinnati and engaged in numerous skirmishes with British regulars that had occupied French forts after the French and Indian War, and the Shawnee who were at the time allies of the Red Coats. The Shawnee gradually withdrew during the first few days before finally engaging American forces 7 miles west of Springfield in present-day Medway on August 8, 1782. After several hours of fighting, both sides suffered moderate casualties before scattering the small Shawnee rearguard. The victory against the Shawnee in the Medway/Mad River Valley area discouraged further Amerindian raids against Kentucky and other parts of the American frontier, and helped in part to secure the whole of the Ohio Territory for the Colonials. Rogers later remarked that the area that is now Medway was of significant strategic importance to the American cause as \\"the Mad River was the artery to the Miami River, and the Miami, the Ohio River thereto.\\" Medway was therefore of strategic importance and, as such, the federal government encouraged many veterans to use their war pensions to settle in the area; descendants of several of these Revolutionary war families reside in the village.http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=477|title=Battle of PiquaThe American Review: A Whig Journal, Devoted to Politics and Literature.

Retrieved 27 February 2012. She is best known for her involvement in the intersection of architecture and social justice. Since her official retirement from architectural practice in 2000, her UN-recognized NGO Heritage Foundation Pakistan has been taking on humanitarian relief work and historical conservation projects in rural villages all around Pakistan. She was awarded with the prestigious Fukuoka Prize in 2016. Early life Yasmeen Lari was born in the town of Dera Ghazi Khan and spent her early years in and around Lahore in a renowned clan of Iraqi Biradari. Her father Zafarul Ahsan, an ICS officer, was working on major development projects in Lahore and other cities, through which Lari was exposed to architecture. Her sister is Pakistani politician Nasreen Jalil. When she was 15 years old, she first left Pakistan to go to London with her family. Initially there for a vacation, she and her siblings ended up enrolling in school in London. Upon her rejection from architecture school, Yasmeen Lari studied two years of arts in London before being accepted into the Oxford Brookes University School of Architecture. Career After graduating from the Oxford School of Architecture in 1964, Lari returned to Pakistan at 23 with her husband, Suhail Zaheer Lari, and opened her architecture firm Lari Associates in Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. She became the first female architect in Pakistan. Initially, she faced difficulties when workers at construction sites challenged her authority or knowledge because of her gender. In 1969, Lari became an elected Member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Her later projects included housing, such as the Angoori Bagh Housing (ABH) (1978), and commercial buildings, such as the Taj Mahal Hotel in 1981, the Finance and Trade Center in 1989, and the Pakistan State Oil House (PSO Company headquarters) in Karachi in 1991. Lari retired in 2000 from architectural practice. However, she remains active with her historical preservation by serving as the advisor of the UNESCO project, as the executive director of Heritage Foundation Pakistan, and as the chairperson of the Karavan Initiatives. Between 2010 and 2014, among other projects Lari had built over 36,000 houses for those affected by Pakistan's floods and earthquakes. Lari implements traditional building techniques and local materials in rebuilding the Sindh Valley region of Pakistan. In 2013, she helped villagers in Awaran District who were hit by the 2013 Balochistan earthquake. Yasmeen Lari is one of the founders and current chairwoman of the Pakistani Chapter of the International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture & Urbanism (INTBAU), created in 2018.  Design philosophy  On architectural practice in Southeast Asia, Lari has said, \\"The two ends of the spectrum of the two worlds we live and work in are best captured in the words of two famous architects, Mies van der Rohe and Hassan Fathy. Mies van der Rohe, a master of putting the elements of a building together and the grand master of detail, has said: \\"I am first interested in a good building.

Ecological psychology is a school of psychology, which follows much of the writings of Roger Barker and James J. Gibson. Those in the field of Ecological Psychology reject the mainstream explanations of perception laid out by cognitive psychology. The ecological psychology can be broken into a few sub categories, perception, action, and dynamical systems. As a clarification, many in this field would reject the separation of perception and action, stating that perception and action are inseparable.  Barker  Roger Barker's work was based on his empirical work at the Midwest Field Station. He wrote later: \\"The Midwest Psychological Field Station was established to facilitate the study of human behavior and its environment in situ by bringing to psychological science the kind of opportunity long available to biologists: easy access to phenomena of the science unaltered by the selection and preparation that occur in laboratories.\\" (Barker, 1968). The study of environmental units (behavior settings) grew out of this research. In his classic work \\"Ecological Psychology\\" (1968) he argued that human behaviour was radically situated: in other words, you couldn't make predictions about human behaviour unless you know what situation or context or environment the human in question was in. For example, there are certain behaviours appropriate to being in church, attending a lecture, working in a factory etc., and the behaviour of people in these environments is more similar than the behaviour of an individual person in different environments. He has since developed these theories in a number of books and articles.* Barker, R. G. (1968). Ecological psychology: Concepts and methods for studying the environment of human behavior.

Gibson, too, stressed the importance of the environment, in particular, the (direct) perception of how the environment of an organism affords various actions to the organism. Thus, an appropriate analysis of the environment was crucial for an explanation of perceptually guided behaviour. He argued that animals and humans stand in a 'systems' or 'ecological' relation to the environment, such that to adequately explain some behaviour it was necessary to study the environment or niche in which the behaviour took place and, especially, the information that 'epistemically connects' the organism to the environment. It is Gibson's emphasis that the foundation for perception is ambient, ecologically available information ‚Äì as opposed to peripheral or internal sensations ‚Äì that makes Gibson's perspective unique in perceptual science in particular and cognitive science in general.Gibson, James J. (1966). The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems, Boston: Hughton Mifflin, p. 21. The aphorism: \\"Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head's inside of\\" captures that idea.Mace, W. M. (1977). James J. Gibson's strategy for perceiving: Ask not what's inside your head, but what your head's inside of. In R. E. Shaw & J. Bransford (Eds.), Perceiving, acting, and knowing. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Gibson's theory of perception is information-based rather than sensation-based and to that extent, an analysis of the environment (in terms of affordances), and the concomitant specificational information that the organism detects about such affordances, is central to the ecological approach to perception. Throughout the 1970s and up until his death in 1979, Gibson increased his focus on the environment through development of the theory of affordances - the real, perceivable opportunities for action in the environment, that are specified by ecological information. Gibson rejected outright indirect perception, in favour of ecological realism, his new form of direct perception that involves the new concept of ecological affordances. He also rejected the emerging constructivist, information processing and cognitivist views that assume and emphasize internal representation and the processing of meaningless, physical sensations ('inputs') in order to create meaningful, mental perceptions ('output'), all supported and implemented by a neurological basis (inside the head). His approach to perception has often been criticised and dismissed when compared to widely publicised advances made in the fields of neuroscience and visual perception by the computational and cognitive approaches. However, developments in cognition studies which consider the role of embodied cognition and action in psychology can be seen to support his basic position.Clark, A., (2008), Supersizing the Mind, Oxford, Oxford University Press. Clark, A. and D. Chalmers, (1998), \\"The Extended Mind.\\" in Analysis, 58(1): 10-23.No√´, A., Out of Our Heads (2009) and Action In Perception (MIT Press, 2004) Given that Gibson's tenet was that \\"perception is based on information, not on sensations\\", his work and that of his contemporaries today can be seen as crucial for keeping prominent the primary question of what is perceived (i.e., affordances, via information) ‚Äì before questions of mechanism and material implementation are considered. Together with a contemporary emphasis on dynamical systems theory and complexity theory as a necessary methodology for investigating the structure of ecological information, the Gibsonian approach has maintained its relevance and applicability to the larger field of cognitive science.

Visual markers of marital status are particularly important because they indicate that a person should not be approached for flirtation, courtship, or sex. In some cultures, married people enjoy special privileges or are addressed differently by members of the community. Marital status markers are usually gender-specific. Husband Male marital status markers are usually less elaborate than female marital status markers. In many cultures, they may not exist. =Jewelry= In many Western nations, some husbands wear a wedding ring on the third or fourth finger of the left hand. In parts of Europe, especially in German-speaking regions, as well as in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine, the wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand. In the Netherlands, Catholics wear their wedding rings on the left hand, while most other people wear them on the right. Some spouses choose to wear their wedding ring on the left hand in Turkey. In China, Western influence has resulted in some husbands donning wedding rings. Traditionally, Chinese men did not wear rings, and were expected to have several concubines. A ring symbolizing marriage to only one spouse was not considered necessary. In modern times, the material of wedding rings is not strictly prescribed; they may be forged of gold, rose gold, white gold, argentium silver, palladium, platinum, titanium, or tungsten carbide. Manual laborers sometimes wear rings of inexpensive or more durable materials like tungsten while working or bear an ink tattoo to avoid damaging a ring of precious metal or personal injury. Additionally, the use of silicon wedding bands has become more common among men (and women) while in a gym or other environment with potential hazards (firefighter, etc.); these bands have enough flexibility to snap off if caught and are not typically electrically conductive. =Beard= Among the Amish, and Hutterite communities of Canada and the United States, only married men are permitted to wear a beard. Unmarried men are required to shave. =Tallit= In some Ashkenazi Jewish communities, men wear a prayer shawl, denominated a \\"tallit\\" or \\"tallis\\", only upon marriage. It is customary for the father of the bride to present the groom with a tallit as a wedding present. In other Jewish communities, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic, all males wear the tallis, but only husbands wear it over their heads. Wife =Jewelry= * Engagement ring: In many Western cultures, a proposal of marriage is traditionally accompanied by the gift of a ring. The man proposes and offers the ring; if the woman accepts this proposal of marriage, she will wear the ring, showing she is no longer available for courtship. In British-American tradition, diamond rings are the most popular type of engagement ring. The engagement ring is usually worn on the left ring finger (sometimes this ring is switched from the right to the left hand as part of the wedding ceremony). * Wedding ring: Many Western wedding ceremonies include the exchange of a wedding ring or rings. A common custom is for the groom to place a ring on the bride's finger and say, \\"With this ring I thee wed.\\" Sometimes both bride and groom present each other with rings and repeat either these or similar words. After the ceremony, the rings are worn throughout the marriage. In the event of divorce, the couple usually removes their rings; but some widows continue to wear their wedding ring, sometimes switching it to the right hand, while others do not. In Jewish tradition, the wedding ring must be a plain band, without gemstones. China has acquired the custom of wedding rings as late as the era of post-Cultural Revolution economic reforms, when rings were affordable and Western influence was allowed in. As an adopted habit, there are variations on how rings are used, if at all, and when. Some women wear the wedding ring on the left hand, men on the right (representing yin and yang). Some men wear the ring on the right hand. Many Chinese put the ring away to protect it, except for important holidays, such as anniversaries. In Chinese tradition, higher status for men was signified by having several young female partners or concubines. A ring denies that status. For this reason, many modern Chinese men do not wear a wedding ring. Diamonds and two-partner wedding rings are advertised in modern China.http://www.nipic.com/show/4/79/7f01e48287204bfa.html The Japanese, despite American occupation in the 1950s, only acquired a culture for wedding and engagement rings in the 1960s. In 1959, the importing of diamonds was allowed. In 1967 a U.S. advertising agency created a marketing campaign on behalf of the De Beers diamonds. The campaign equated rings with other symbols of Western culture. The campaign resulted in a sharp increase in demand: From 5% in 1967, to 27% in 1972, to 50% in 1978, to 60% in 1980. * Mangalsutra: In Hindu wedding ceremonies, the groom gives the bride a gold pendant or necklace incorporating black beads or black string. This is called a \\"mangal-sutra\\". It not only proclaims a woman's marriage, but it is believed by many to exercise a protective influence over the husband. That is, a wife's love and concern, as shown by her donning of the mangal-sutra, is magically helpful to the husband. This resembles the karwa-chauth celebration, in which a wife fasts and prays for her husband's welfare. * Bangles: Hindu wives also wear bangles of either white (\\"sankha\\") and/or red colour (\\"pala\\") on both hands, and do not remove them until they are single. Often made of glass, they are broken when the marriage ends. Bollywood uses this to great dramatic effect in Hindi films, with a woman being informed of the demise of her husband by the messenger, often her son, smashing her glass bangles and wiping the sindoor off her forehead. Bangles made of gold, silver, or other materials are also worn by middle class wives. The concept of mourning jewelry, which is colored black, is becoming an accepted, visible custom for widows and widowers. Usually a black wedding band is worn on the third finger of the left hand. Usually the ring is a black wedding band, but black eternity bands and black solitaires are also worn. Such jewelry is denominated a \\"widow's ring\\" and the mourning ring is added to the marriage ring(s) and worn for the duration of the mourning period. =Headwear= In Orthodox Judaism, married women cover their hair at all times outside of their home. The kind of hair covering may be determined by local custom or personal preference. Headscarves, snoods, hats, berets, or - sometimes - wigs are used. Turkmen wives wear a special hat similar to a circlet that is denominated a \\"Alynda≈ày\\". =Hairstyle= * Hairstyle indicating marital status * Zuni hair styles =Cosmetics= * Sindoor, a red powder (vermilion), is put on Hindu wives' foreheads to indicate their marital status. =Clothes= * Hindu widows wear white. (See White clothing (religious)) * Tibetan wives wear aprons. * In western and northern Europe, it was previously common for widows to wear black, at least until the first anniversary of the death of their husbands, and some still practice this custom.

It was Hardy's second published novel, and the first of what was to become his series of Wessex novels. Critics recognise it as an important precursor to his later tragic works, setting the scene for the Wessex that the author would return to again and again. Hardy himself called the story of the Mellstock Quire and its west-gallery musicians \\"a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages, ways, and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of [the 1850s].\\"  Plot  The novel follows the activities of a group of west gallery musicians, the Mellstock parish choir, one of whom, Dick Dewy, becomes romantically entangled with a comely new village schoolmistress, Fancy Day. The novel opens with the fiddlers and singers of the choir ‚Äî including Dick, his father Reuben Dewy, and grandfather William Dewy ‚Äî making the rounds in Mellstock village on Christmas Eve. When the little band plays at the schoolhouse, young Dick falls for Fancy at first sight. Dick, smitten, seeks to insinuate himself into her life and affections, but Fancy's beauty has gained her other suitors including Shiner, a rich farmer, and Mr Maybold, the new vicar at the parish church. Maybold informs the choir that he intends Fancy, an accomplished organist, to replace their traditional gallery singing and string accompaniment to Sunday services. Reuben Dewy and the rest of the band visit the rectory to negotiate, but reluctantly give way to the vicar's wishes. Dick seems to win Fancy's heart, and the two become secretly engaged. When he is told, Fancy's father is initially opposed, but changes his mind when as a consequence Fancy stops eating and her health deteriorates. Some months later, after Fancy's first Sunday service as organist, Maybold unexpectedly proposes marriage, and promises Fancy a life of relative affluence; racked by guilt and temptation, she accepts. The next day, however, at a chance meeting with Dick, Maybold learns that Fancy is in fact already spoken for. Maybold writes her a letter, admonishing her to be honest with Dick and to withdraw her commitment to him if she indeed meant what she said in accepting Maybold. Fancy, on reconsideration, withdraws her consent to marry Maybold, and asks him to keep her initial acceptance forever a secret. Maybold again urges her to be honest with Dick about the episode. The final chapter is a joyful and humorous portrait of Reuben, William, and the rest of the Mellstock rustics as they celebrate Dick and Fancy's wedding day. The novel concludes after the ceremony with Dick telling Fancy that their happiness must be due to there being such full confidence between them. He says that they will have no secrets from each other, \\"no secrets at all\\". Fancy replies ‚ÄúNone from to-day‚Äù and, changing the subject, thinks \\"of a secret she would never tell\\".  Principal characters  * Dick Dewy: a young member of the Mellstock Choir, in love with Fancy Day * Fancy Day: the new teacher at the village school * Mr Maybold: the new vicar of Mellstock * Robert Penny: one of the choir, a boot and shoe-maker by profession * Reuben Dewy: Dick's father, a tranter (carrier), and the de facto leader of and spokesman for the Mellstock Choir * William Dewy: Dick's grandfather * Geoffrey Day: Fancy's father, gamekeeper and steward at one of the Earl of Wessex's outlying estates * Frederic Shiner: a rich farmer in Mellstock, and Dick's rival in the courtship of Fancy. Background Hardy began work on what would become the first of his Wessex novels, Under the Greenwood Tree in 1871, the genesis of the novel being a conflict between his grandfather‚Äôs ‚Äòstring choir‚Äô of viols and voices in Stinsford church, and a new vicar who was determined to replace the choir with an up-to-date organ. He modelled Mellstock on Stinsford and Brockhampton, and the Dewy‚Äôs house on his own family home. Although the characters were not directly modelled on members of his family, he did make use of the fact that his sister Mary had trained as a schoolteacher. Writing forty years later, Hardy recalled \\"This story of the Mellstock Quire and its old established west-gallery musicians ... is intended to be a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages, ways, and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the villages of fifty or sixty years ago.\\" The book was originally to be called The Mellstock Quire, but during the summer of 1871 Hardy added significant additional material, de-emphasising the tribulations of the choir and focusing the plot on the love story between Dick and Fancy. With the new structure came a new title, Under the Greenwood Tree, taken from a song in Shakespeare's As You Like It (Act II, Scene V), and a subtitle, A Rural Painting of the Dutch School. Having received a discouraging reply from Macmillan, to whom he offered the manuscript in 1871, Hardy accepted an offer from the ultimate publisher, Tinsley, of ¬£30 for the copyright. Later, when Hardy had become more established, he attempted to retrieve the copyright but declined to pay Tinsley's quoted price of ¬£300; the copyright was to remain with the publisher and his successors until after Hardy's death.  Publication  Under the Greenwood Tree was published by Tinsley on 15 June 1872, with the author's name not appearing on the first edition. The novel was published in the United States in June 1873 by Holt & Williams, and was serialised there the following year. When the book was re-published in the UK in 1912 by Macmillan, the full title became Under the Greenwood Tree, or, The Mellstock Quire: A Rural Painting of the Dutch School.  Criticism and analysis  The book was well reviewed on its publication, receiving special praise for its freshness and originality. Sometimes grouped with Hardy's lesser novels, Under the Greenwood Tree is also recognised by critics as an important precursor to his major works. In his 1872 review of the novel for the Saturday Review, the critic Horace Moule, one of Hardy's mentors and friends, called it a \\"prose idyll\\", and that judgement has stuck. While the novel closes on an ambiguous and even sceptical note, it is nevertheless distinguished among Hardy's fiction‚Äîparticularly his Wessex novels‚Äîfor its relative happiness and amiability. For the critic Irving Howe, Under the Greenwood Tree served as a kind of necessary prequel and establishing myth for the world of Wessex that Hardy depicted in subsequent tragic works: the novel, he argued, \\"is a fragile evocation of a self-contained country world that in Hardy's later fiction will come to seem distant and unavailable, a social memory by which to judge the troubled present.\\" Hardy‚Äôs 2006 biographer Claire Tomalin praised Hardy for the beauty and precision of his descriptive writing, and noted that the book has charmed generations of readers. Indeed, she said, there are always readers who go to him primarily to immerse themselves in ‚Äúthe Dorset woodlands, streams and rivers, fields and meadows, cottages and churches, soft skies and birdsong‚Äù. Tomalin considered the villagers to be drawn sympathetically, and with beautifully turned dialogue, but noted that the author rather distances the rustic characters, inviting the reader to smile with him at their simplicity. This was something that Hardy himself recognised, and in 1912 he wrote ‚ÄúIn rereading the narrative after a long interval there occurs the inevitable reflection that the realities out of which it was spun were material for another kind of study of this little group of church musicians than is found in the chapters here penned so lightly, even so farcically and flippantly at times.

It was released anonymously by Tinsley Brothers in 1871. Plot summary In Desperate Remedies a young woman, Cytherea Graye, is forced by poverty to accept a post as lady's maid to the eccentric Miss Aldclyffe, the woman whom her father had loved but had been unable to marry. Cytherea loves a young architect, Edward Springrove, but Miss Adclyffe's machinations, the discovery that Edward is already engaged to a woman whom he does not love, and the urgent need to support a sick brother drive Cytherea to accept the hand of Aeneas Manston, Miss Adclyffe's illegitimate son, whose first wife is believed to have perished in a fire; however, their marriage is almost immediately nullified when it emerges that his first wife had left the inn before it caught fire. Manston's wife, apparently, returns to live with him, but Cytherea, her brother, the local rector, and Edward come to suspect that the woman claiming to be Mrs. Manston is an impostor. It emerges that Manston killed his wife in an argument after she left the inn, and had brought in the impostor to prevent his being prosecuted for murder, as the argument had been heard (but not seen) by a poacher, who suspected Manston of murder and had planned to go to the police if his wife did not turn up alive. In the novel's climax, Manston attempts to kidnap Cytherea and flee, but is stopped by Edward; he later commits suicide in his cell, and Cytherea and Edward marry.

The battle of Pulo Aura was a minor naval engagement fought on 14 February 1804, in which a fleet of East Indiamen, including Earl of Abergavenny, intimidated, drove off, and chased a powerful French naval squadron, although the French squadron was much stronger than they. Commodore Nathaniel Dance's aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral Charles- Alexandre Durand Linois to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance, in Warley, together with several of the other vessels, then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger. The British lost only one man killed. Earl of Abergavenny did not actually take part in the exchange of fire. Earl of Abergavenny reached Malacca five days later, on 19 February 1804 and Penang on 1 March. She arrived at St Helena on 9 June and the Downs on 8 August. Voyage #5 (1805‚Äìwreck) \\"Part of the Crew of the Abergavenny East Indiaman, delivered\\", Thomas Tegg, 1808, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Earl of Abergavanney left on her fifth voyage, this one to Bengal and China, under the command of Captain John Wordsworth, Jnr. She sailed with four other Indiamen and two whalers from Portsmouth on 1 February 1805. The four Indiamen were , , , and . Captain William Stanley Clarke of Wexford was the senior EIC commander. Captain John Draper and , herself a former merchantman, provided the naval escort. On 5 February Earl of Abergavenny struck on the Shambles off the Isle of Portland and then sank in Weymouth Bay with the loss of 263 lives, including Wordsworth, out of 402 people on board. Her complement for this voyage consisted of 160 officers and crew. She also carried 159 troops, from both the British Army and East India Company. Forty passengers were listed as being at the Captain's table, while 11 were listed as being at the Third Mate's table. In addition, there were 32 Chinese passengers. Her loss was due to the pilot's incompetence. After she struck on the Shambles she was got off, but sank as Wordsworth attempted to sail her onto the beach. Wordsworth stayed at his post and went down with his ship. About 90 to 100 people survived the sinking. The total value of Earl of Abergavennys cargo was estimated to be ¬£200,000. It consisted of porcelain and some ¬£70,000 in specie. The EIC put the value of the cargo it had lost at ¬£79,710.Reports from the Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed to enquire into the present state of the affairs of the East India Company, together with the minutes of evidence, an appendix of documents, and a general index, (1830), Vol. 2, p.977. Subsequent salvage attempts recovered the specie, which was in the form of 62 chests of dollars. By October 1807 almost all the valuable property had been recovered, including 30 pipes of wine. In September 1812 the wreck was blown up under water to prevent her forming a dangerous shoal.

The Spanish suffered a major military defeat, almost always referred to by the Spanish as the Disaster of Annual (), which led to major political crises and a redefinition of Spanish colonial policy toward the Rif.  Background  In early 1921, the Spanish Army started an offensive into northeastern Morocco from the coastal regions that they already held. The advance took place without extended lines of communication being adequately established or the complete subjugation of the areas occupied. In the course of the Spanish offensive, the Spanish commander, General Manuel Fern√°ndez Silvestre, had penetrated almost 130 km into the enemy lines, but during the hasty advances, neither defensible forts nor accessible water supply points had been put in place. The territory newly occupied by the Spanish was garrisoned only by multiple small makeshift blockhouses (blocaos), each manned by a handful of soldiers (typically 12-20). The outposts were widely spread, typically located in high places, distant from water sources and lacking good communications with the main positionsABC (Spain)  Annual  In January 1921 the Spanish forces under Silvestre occupied the small village of Annual in the valley of Beni Ulicheck, and established their main forward base for completing the seizure of the eastern region of Morocco. Silvestre was considered an impetuous and aggressive personality, who was known to be a favourite of King Alfonso XIII. During his year in military command of the Medilla comandancia, Silvestre had doubled the amont of territory held by the Spanish in the central Rif.David S. Woolman, page 91 \\"Rebels in the Rif\\", Stanford University Press 1968 Annual was situated about eighty miles to the south-west of Medilla. Surviving photographs show the Annual encampment itself to have been a sprawling tented encampment spread over several slopes in a starkly empty landscape.  Battle  General Silvestre and staff 1921 On July 22, after five days of skirmishing, 5,000 Spanish troops occupying the advanced encampment of Annual were attacked by 3,000 Rif fighters. With ammunition low and a support base already over-run General Silvestre, who had arrived at Annual only the day before, decided upon a withdrawal along the line of the previous Spanish advance. Just before 5 a.m. a last radio message was sent, reporting Silvestre's intention to evacuate Annual later the same morning. At about 10 a.m., the garrison began to march in column from the encampment, but confused leadership and inadequate preparation meant that any hope of a disciplined withdrawal quickly degenerated into a disorganised rout. The Spanish conscripts, under heavy fire and exhausted by the intense heat, broke into a confused crowd and were shot down or knifed by the tribesmen. Only one cavalry unit, the Cazadores de Alc√°ntara, kept in formation and was able to conduct a fighting retreat (see painting above). The riffi irregular forces were commanded by Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi (usually known as Abd el Krim), a former civil servant at the Spanish administration in the Office of Indigenous Affairs in Melilla and one of the leaders of the tribe of the Aith Ouriaghel. The overextended Spanish military structure in the Western Spanish Protectorate in Morocco crumbled. After the battle, the Riffian Berbers began to advance eastward and overran more than 130 Spanish blocaos.Sasse, 2006, page 40. The Spanish garrisons were destroyed without mounting a coordinated response to the attacks. By the end of August, Spain had lost all the territories that it had gained in the area since 1909. General Silvestre disappeared and his remains were never found.David S. Woolman, page 91 \\"Rebels in the Rif\\", Stanford University Press According to one report, Spanish sergeant Francisco Basallo Berrcerra of the Kandussi garrison, Sgt Berrcerra was a survivor of the Dar Quebdani massacre, where 900 Spanish soldiers were reportedly killed in cold blood after they had surrenderedAnnual: horror, masacre y olvido|El Pa√≠s identified the remains of Silvestre by his general's sash. A Moorish courier from Kaddur Namar claimed that eight days after the battle, he saw the corpse of the general lying face down on the battlefield.Juan Pando, Historia Secreta del Annual (Madrid: Ediciones Temas de Hoy, 1999), 335‚Äì36.  Spanish retreat  Spanish officers inspecting the remains of the garrison at Monte Arruit in January 1922. At Afrau, on the coast, Spanish warships were able to evacuate the garrison. At Zoco el Telata de Mtalsa, in the south, Spanish troops and civilians were able to retreat to the French Zone. Spanish survivors of the battle retreated some 80 km to the spread-out fortified base of Monte Arruit, which was built between 1912 and 1916 and located south of Melilla. There, a stand was attempted under the leadership of General Felipe Navarro. As the position was surrounded, and cut off from water and supplies, General D√°maso Berenguer Fust√©, Spanish High Commissioner in the protectorate, authorised its surrender on August 9. The Rife√±os reportedly did not respect the conditions of surrender and killed 3,000 Spanish soldiers. Vozpopuli.com, accessed August 8, 2016 General Navarro was taken prisoner, along with 534 military personnel and 53 civiliansJuan Pando, Historia Secreta del Annual (Madrid: Ediciones Temas de Hoy, 1999), p. 335. who were ransomed some years later. Melilla was only some 40 km away but was in no position to help since the city was almost defenceless and lacked properly-trained troops. The exhausted and demoralised survivors of Annual who reached Melilla were in no condition to reinforce the existing garrison effectively.Sasse, 2006, p. 41. However, the Riffian tribal forces had largely dispersed following the capture of Monte Arruit, leaving Abd-el-Krim with insufficient men to lay siege to Melilla. In addition, citizens of other European nations lived in Melilla, and he did not wish to risk international intervention. Abd-el-Krim later stated that to have been was his greatest mistake.J. Roger-Mathieu, Memoires d'Abd-el-Krim (Paris, 1927) Spain quickly assembled about 14,000 reinforcements from elite units of the Army of Africa, which had been operating south of Tetuan in the Western Zone. They mainly comprised units of the Spanish Legion who had been newly raised in 1920, and Moroccan regulares. Transferred to Melilla by sea, the reinforcements enabled the city to be held and Monte Arruit to be retaken by the end of November. Retreat of the Spanish troops to Melilla after the battle of Annual The Spaniards may have lost up to 22,000 soldiers at Annual and in the subsequent fighting. The German historian Werner Brockdorff states that only 1,200 of the 20,000 Spanish troops escaped alive, but that estimate of losses appears to be exaggerated. Rif casualties were reportedly only 800.Johannes Ebert, Knut G√∂rich, Detlef Wienecke-Janz: Die gro√üe Chronik Weltgeschichte ‚Äì Band 15 Der erste Weltkrieg und seine Folgen, wissenmedia Verlag, 2008, , p. 203. The final official figures for the Spanish death toll, both at Annual and during the subsequent rout which took Riffian forces to the outskirts of Melilla, were reported to the Cortes Generales as 13,192 killed.David S. Woolman, p. 96. Rebels in the Rif, Stanford University Press Materiel lost by the Spanish, in the summer of 1921 and especially in the Battle of Annual, included 11,000 rifles, 3,000 carbines, 1,000 muskets, 60 machine guns, 2,000 horses, 1,500 mules, 100 cannons, and a large quantity of ammunition.Dirk Sasse, Franzosen, Briten und Deutsche im Rifkrieg 1921‚Äì1926, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2006, , p. 157. Abd el Krim remarked later: \\"In just one night, Spain supplied us with all the equipment which we needed to carry on a big war\\". Other sources give the amount of booty seized by Rif warriors as 20,000 rifles (German made Mausers), 400 machine guns (Hotchkisses), and 120 to 150 artillery pieces (Schneiders).Margaret Peil, Olatunji Y.

G. Lepage: The French Foreign Legion: An Illustrated History, McFarland, 2008, , p. 125.  Aftermath  The political crisis brought about by this disaster led Indalecio Prieto to say in the Congress of Deputies: \\"We are at the most acute period of Spanish decadence. The campaign in Africa is a total, absolute failure of the Spanish Army, without extenuation.\\" The Minister of War ordered the creation of an investigative commission, led by General Juan Picasso Gonz√°lez, which developed the report known as Expediente Picasso. The report detailed numerous military mistakes, but the obstructive action of various ministers and judges made it not go so far as to lay political responsibility for the defeat. In all, the defeat is often thought of in Spain as the worst of the Spanish army in modern times.La derrota m√°s amarga del Ej√©rcito espa√±ol - ABC.es The reasons for the crushing defeat may lie with Manuel Fern√°ndez Silvestre's tactical decisions and the fact that the bulk of the Spanish army was formed by poorly-trained conscripts. Popular opinion widely placed the blame for the disaster upon King Alfonso XIII, who, according to several sources, had encouraged Silvestre's irresponsible penetration to positions far from Melilla without having adequate defenses in his rear. Alfonso's apparent indifference (vacationing in southern France, he reportedly said, \\"Chicken meat is cheap\\" when informed of the disasterWoolman, 102 even though other sources render the quote as \\"chicken meat is expensive\\" when he was informed about the ransom demanded by Abd-el-Krim for the officials made prisoners in Mount Arruit) led to a popular backlash against the monarchy. The crisis was one of the many that over the course of the next decade undermined the Spanish monarchy and led to the rise of the Second Spanish Republic. On 2 July 2012, the cavalry regiment Cazadores de Alc√°ntara was awarded the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand by the Council of Ministers for its rearguard action in Annual.

It was Hardy's third published novel, and the first not published anonymously upon its first publication. Plot The book describes the love triangle of a young woman, Elfride Swancourt, and her two suitors from very different backgrounds. Stephen Smith is a socially inferior but ambitious young man who adores her and with whom she shares a country background. Henry Knight is the respectable, established, older man who represents London society. Although the two are friends, Knight is not aware of Smith's previous liaison with Elfride. Elfride finds herself caught in a battle with her heart, her mind and the expectations of those around her ‚Äì her parents and society. When Elfride's father finds that his guest and candidate for his daughter's hand, architect's assistant Stephen Smith, is the son of a mason, he immediately orders him to leave. Knight, who is a relative of Elfride's stepmother, is later on the point of seeking to marry Elfride, but ultimately rejects her when he learns she had been previously courted. Elfride, out of desperation, marries a third man, Lord Luxellian. The conclusion finds both suitors travelling together to Elfride, both intent on claiming her hand, and neither knowing either that she already is married or that they are accompanying her corpse and coffin as they travel. Characters Elfride Swancourt, the heroine, is both extremely attractive and emotionally naive; a Victorian Miranda. Stephen Smith, her first suitor, also has this childish innocence, and she loves him because he is 'so docile and gentle' (chapter 7). Henry Knight, the second suitor, is more dominantly masculine, with the expectation of Elfride's spiritual and physical virginity. Background This was the third of Hardy's novels to be published and the first to bear his name. It was first serialised in Tinsley's Magazine between September 1872 and July 1873. The novel is notable for the strong parallels to Hardy and his first wife Emma Gifford. In fact, of Hardy's early novels, this is probably the most densely populated with autobiographical events. Reception A review in the Examiner of Far from the Madding Crowd retrospectively referred to it as \\"not so exclusively pictoral [as Under the Greenwood Tree]; it was study of a more tragic kind, with more complex characters and a more stirring plot...Both Under the Greenwood Tree and A Pair of Blue Eyes are very remarkable novels, which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation, and pictoral and narrative power of the writer.\\" Late in his life, Hardy met composer Sir Edward Elgar and discussed the possibility of Elgar basing an opera on the novel. Hardy's death put an end to the project. BBC Radio 4 recorded the book as a serial, with Jeremy Irons as Harry Knight. Literary criticism A Pair of Blue Eyes normally is categorised as one of Hardy's minor works, 'a book with a few good points but a failure as a whole'. Like Desperate Remedies, it contains melodramatic scenes that appear disconnected from the characters and plot. A focus of critical interest of the novel is the scene in which Henry Knight reviews the entire history of the world as he hangs over the edge of a cliff (reputedly the origin of the term 'cliffhanger'), and eventually is rescued by a rope of Elfride's underwear. Carl J. Weber sources the scene to a picnic Hardy and his wife had, in which he was sent to search for a lost earring, claiming this passage is the \\"first indication in the novels of Hardy's ability to sustain interest in a tense situation by sheer power of vivid description.\\" On the other hand, Millgate claims the scene forms part of the \\"irrelevant\\" description suited to the \\"rag-bag\\" of a novel. For Jean Brooks, the scene is 'macabre' and an illustration of 'cosmic indifference', also highlighting the comic in the rescue. However, Gittings and Halperin claim it is more likely the idea for this scene comes from an essay by Leslie Stephen titled 'Five minutes in the Alps'. The 'cliff without a name', as it is referred to, is probably based on Beeny Cliff.

It was written, in serial form, for the Cornhill Magazine, which was edited by Leslie Stephen, a friend and mentor of Hardy's. Unlike the majority of Hardy's fiction, the novel is a comedy, with both humour and a happy ending for the major characters and no suicides or tragic deaths.

Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p. 236 Plot summary At the beginning of the book, it is told that Ethelberta was raised in humble circumstances but, through her work as a governess, married well at the age of eighteen. Her husband died two weeks after the wedding and, now twenty-one, Ethelberta lives with her mother-in-law, Lady Petherwin. In the three years that have elapsed since the deaths of both her husband and father-in-law, Ethelberta has been treated to foreign travel and further privilege by her benefactress, but restricted from seeing her poor family. The events of the story concern Ethelberta's career as a famous poet and storyteller as she struggles to support her family and conceal her secret‚Äîthat her father is a butler. Beautiful, clever, and rational, she easily attracts four very persistent suitors (Mr. Christopher Julian (a struggling musician), Mr. Neigh and Mr. Ladywell, both gentlemen and friends, and Lord Mountclere, a 65-year old aristocrat with a dubious past), but is reluctant to give her much-coveted hand. She finally elects for Lord Mountclere, after he comes to know the secret of her low birth and family, and she comes to dominate him, running his estate and saving him from bankruptcy. Her unrequited suitor Christopher Julian realises he would never have been happy with her had she married him, and settles for her younger sister Picotee who had been in love with him for years.

Career Guillory first began performing in 1965, while still attending St. John's River Junior College where he became a member of The Illusions, eventually becoming lead guitarist. While studying music at Roosevelt University in Chicago during 1965 to 1969, he recorded two albums with The Cryan' Shames as bass player. Towards the end of 1965, Guillory moved to Chicago where he studied guitar at the Chicago School of Music. He then attended Wright Junior College for three years where he played with The Revelles. The group played with Chicago DJ, Art Roberts, of WLS. He then played with The Cryan' Shames. During 1970 to 1976 Guillory performed at the Shakespeare's Head Folk Club in Carnaby Street, London. After active resistance to the Vietnam War, Guillory left the USA in November 1970, acquired a Martin D-35 and lived throughout Europe. He worked as an acoustic solo performer and settled in the United Kingdom. Guillory came to earn a reputation as one of the best guitarists ever. Many guitarists today emulate techniques Guillory evolved in the early 70's while living in the south of Spain. A particular signature technique that he developed was 'hybrid picking', where he would sustain a bass line with a plectrum held between his thumb and first finger, whilst picking chord and melody lines with his second and third fingers. Having studied classical guitar in his younger years, Guillory would often incorporate quasi-classical techniques into his playing and on occasions would even throw in some pure classical guitar pieces, merging them into various songs as a medley. His soft American accent always went down well with British audiences and Guillory would exploit this with his witty on-stage banter between songs. Throughout his career, Guillory sought to encourage younger musicians at every opportunity and would often allow them to play as a 'floor-act' before he came on stage. He was widely known for insisting on carrying his own PA sound system with him from gig to gig. This allowed him to reproduce the exact sound he wanted night after night regardless of the venue. This was quite rare at the time with solo singer/guitarists on the folk circuit and certainly helped him to communicate his renowned performing skills to his audiences without having to fear the usual technical blips that can occur using a venue's house PA. He always concentrated on live solo performances (which put him up-close with more intimate small audiences) and sharing his understanding of music; touring, creating his own online guitar school.Guillory guitar school at anetstation.com After an initial recording deal with Atlantic Records published five more CDs on his own independent label, Personal Records.Personal Records at anetstation.com As a performer he was dedicated to sharing his gift with both audience and fellow musicians, and as a teacher he never hesitated to share in a manner that others could understand. He performed frequently as a guest artist for recordings and films with, among many others, Al Stewart, Donovan, Mick Jagger, Elkie Brooks, Peter Sarstedt, Buggles, Barbara Dickson, and Nick Heyward. Guillory released Isaac Guillory, a self-titled album in 1974. For a while he delved into jazz fusion and recorded with Pacific Eardrum. Isaac lectured at the Guildhall School of Music in London. His music can be heard on 'A' Net Station, a web radio station that he helped found, where his website continues to be available.Guillory page at anetstation.com He also wrote The Guitar Hand Book with friend, Ralph Denyer, which became the foundation for the BBC series Rockschool. In his later years, he performed on the folk club circuit in Great Britain. His virtuoso guitar playing made him popular with audiences and ensured a steady stream of work as a performer and teacher. His final album, The Days of '49, recorded on tour during late 1999 and released in early 2000, included a number of solo compositions as well as arrangements of some folk standards. His tribute to the British guitarist John Renbourn, \\"Dear John\\", is one of the highlights of an outstanding album. Personal life Guillory was born at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, the son of Victoria (Ojalvo) and Easton Joseph Guillory, an American sailor. His maternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Turkey, who met and married by arrangement only 10 days before they sailed for Cuba. His family was Jewish. He attended the Conservatory of Music, Havana, where he studied classical piano at the age of six. Guillory's mother, a professional musician, taught him to play guitar. When he was 11, Guillory moved to Tallahassee, Florida. At age 14, he moved again to Gainesville, then finally settled in Palatka, Florida. By age 14, after enrolling in University of Florida's swimming program, he became an assistant swimming instructor. He was a student at St. Johns River State College, at the time named St. Johns River Junior College, in Palatka. There, he studied the cello and saxophone. He married twice, first to the English model Tina Thompson (divorced 1990), mother of Jace and British actress and model Sienna Guillory, then in 1993, to Victoria McMillan, mother of Easton and Ellie. Guillory died on New Year's Eve 2000. His death was attributed to complications from cancer that had gone undetected for some time.

In United States railroad terminology, a troop sleeper was a railroad passenger car which had been constructed to serve as something of a mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations. This method allowed part of the trip to be made overnight, reducing the amount of transit time required and increasing travel efficiency. History =Background and development= Between December 1941 and June 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed services personnel. As there were not enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry to build 440 troop kitchen cars.Hediger, p. 80 This new rolling stock was either converted from existing boxcars or built from scratch based on Association of American Railroads standard 50'-6\\" single-sheathed steel boxcar designs, and were constructed entirely out of steel with heavily reinforced ends. In some instances baggage cars were converted into temporary kitchen cars before ACF could complete its order.McGuirk, p. 90 The cars were painted the standard Pullman Green and affixed with gold lettering. Along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's \\"Surf Line,\\" trains consisting of 10-12 former Southern Pacific interurban trailer cars, owned by the U.S. Maritime Commission but bearing Santa Fe markings, were fitted with conventional knuckle couplers at each end of the trainset and pressed into service to handle the additional passenger loads.Duke and Kistler, p. 119 Equipped with special Allied Full Cushion high-speed swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers were designed to be fully interchangeable with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors similar to those found on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules.Signor, p. 31 Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side at the center of the cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens. Troop sleepers, generally intended for use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, and slept 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were laid out in a cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted at each end of the car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.McGuirk, p. 92 United States Army \\"Medical Department Kitchen Car\\" #8762 sits at the Lafayette, Indiana shops of the Monon Railroad on April 17, 1947. =Troop kitchens= Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, also joined the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took their meals in their seats or bunks). As the cooking was performed by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped with a pair of 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed in the middle of the train so that food could be served from both ends.Hediger, p. 82 Troop hospital cars, also based on the troop sleeper carbody, transported wounded servicemen and typically travelled in solid strings on special trains averaging fifteen cars each. Each had 38 berths for patients, 30 of which were arranged in the central section of the car in three tiers on each side. There was also a section with six berths which could be used for isolation cases as well as private compartments for special cases. Each unit was ice air- conditioned and came fitted with a shower room along with a modern kitchen with the latest equipment.Wider, p. 87 =Afterlife and preservation= Troop cars saw service through 1947, after which many were declared surplus and sold by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and were subsequently converted into baggage cars, express service boxcars, refrigerator cars, and cabooses, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use as bunk cars by maintenance of way crews.Pearce, p. 62 Several Kitchen Cars remained in Department of Defense service, being converted into Guard Cars to accompany sensitive military rail movements, such as military unit equipment deployments, and the Strategic Air Command's mobile B-52 and KC-135 cockpit simulators. Subsequent conflicts have not created the need for such an arrangement, partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long-distance transportation of troops. Today, preserved troop sleepers and kitchen cars can be seen at several railroad museums and tourist railroads across the United States.

Retrieved on April 5, 2012. MVSU is a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. History The institution, which opened in 1950, was created by the Mississippi Legislature as Mississippi Vocational College. The legislation to form the institution was signed into law by Governor Thomas L. Bailey on April 5, 1946. On February 10, 1950, Governor Fielding L. Wright served as the main speaker at the opening ceremony. The legislature anticipated that legal segregation of public education was in danger because there were increasing challenges to it through legal suits (in 1954 it was declared unconstitutional in the United States Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education). It created this institution in the hopes that it would attract African American applicants who might otherwise apply to Mississippi's premier whites- only institutions: the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi. State leaders hoped that founding separate institutions of higher learning for Mississippi's black population would reduce the pressure to integrate the state's premier universities. To attract the support of those who opposed any government action to provide higher education to blacks, those proposing creation of M.V.C. used the term \\"vocational\\" to imply that the institution's main purpose would be to train blacks to take on blue-collar jobs. The site selection committee appointed by the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning had originally selected as a site the former Greenwood Army Air Base, which had many facilities ready for use and thus would have been a very cost- effective choice. The Greenwood Commonwealth celebrated the choice. However, residents of Carroll County, Mississippi objected to having the institution located near their properties.James Herbert White. Up From a Cotton Patch: J.H. White and the Development of Mississippi Valley State University([s.n.] 1979), p. 36. After further study, the committee selected a site in Itta Bena. Whites of that town also objected to having a black institution nearby, so the final site chosen was away from the downtown area, and on land that was not good for cultivation. In 1964, Mississippi Vocational College was renamed Mississippi Valley State College. In February 1969, a nonviolent student boycott, which included eight hundred students, male and female, was organized to protest President James Herbert White's administration. The students demanded required courses in black history, more library purchases of works by black writers, remedial courses in English and Math, scheduling of prominent black speakers, and fewer curfew restrictions. In the early 1970s, civil rights leaders continued to protest the inequalities in higher education opportunities offered to whites and blacks in Mississippi. In an effort to defuse some of the criticism, Gov. Bill Waller proposed changing the names of three black institutions from \\"colleges\\" to \\"universities\\". Thus, in 1974, the institution was renamed again, as Mississippi Valley State University. Following President White, Dr. Ernest A. Boykins, Jr. took office in July 1971. Dr. Joe L. Boyer became MVSU's third president in January 1982 and was followed by Dr. William W. Sutton in July 1988. Dr. Lester C. Newman became the fifth president of MVSU on July 1, 1998. Dr. Donna H. Oliver became MVSU's sixth president and first female president on January 1, 2009. On November 6, 2013, Dr. William Bynum took office as MVSU's seventh president. In May 2017, Bynum departed MVSU to become president of Jackson State University. Dr. Jerryl Briggs, who served as executive vice president and chief operating officer in Bynum's administration, was named interim president of the university shortly afterwards. On October 19, 2017, Briggs was officially named as the university's eighth president.Briggs named president of Mississippi Valley State University, mississippi.edu; accessed October 27, 2017. In a 1997 article in Innovative Higher Education, the journalist Dale Thorn describes MVSU's successful attempt to avoid a merger with another institution and to remain a separate entity. In 1998, the university renamed many of the buildings on campus, except for those named for white supremacist politicians Walter Sillers, Jr., Fielding Wright, and J. H. White. Campus The campus is on a tract of land adjacent to U.S. Highway 82 in unincorporated Leflore County, in the Mississippi Delta region, northwest of Itta Bena. The university is about from Greenwood, about from Greenville, about north of Jackson, and about south of Memphis, Tennessee. Academics Mississippi Valley State University offers undergraduate and graduate degrees through the following entities: *College of Art & Sciences *College of Professional Studies *College of Education *Graduate School MVSU offers an honors program to better cater to high-achieving undergraduate students on campus. MVSU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees.

He pioneered extremely detailed studies of the way people use language in everyday life. Despite his early death in a car crash and the fact that he did not publish widely, he founded the discipline of conversation analysis. His work has had significant influence on fields such as linguistics, discourse analysis, and discursive psychology. Academic career Sacks received his doctoral degree in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley (1966), an LL.B. at Yale Law School (1959), and a B.A. at Columbia College (1955). He lectured at the University of California, Los Angeles and Irvine from 1964-1975. Work Sacks became interested in the structure of conversation while working at a suicide counseling hotline in Los Angeles in the 1960s.[ The calls to the hotline were recorded, and Sacks was able to gain access to the tapes and study them. In the 1960s, prominent linguists like Noam Chomsky believed that conversation was too disorganized to be worthy of any kind of in-depth structural analysis . Sacks strongly disagreed, since he saw structure in every conversation, and developed conversation analysis as a result. Sacks's recorded lectures were transcribed (by Gail Jefferson who also edited them posthumously) but the tapes were not saved. The duplicated copies of the transcribed lectures were made freely available by Sacks and achieved international circulation and recognition during his lifetime and subsequently . He treated such topics as: the organization of person-reference; topic organization and stories in conversation; speaker selection preferences; pre- sequences; the organization of turn-taking; conversational openings and closings; and puns, jokes, stories and repairs in conversation among many others.Sacks, H., & Jefferson, G. (1995). Lectures on conversation. Legacy Emanuel Schegloff, one of Sacks's close collaborators, colleagues and co- authors, became his literary executor. The subsequent handling of the literary estate (Nachlass, to use the academic term) has attracted some controversy. Sacks's major work, Lectures on Conversation, is composed of edited revisions of transcribed lectures held from Spring 1964 through to 1972, and comprises about 1200 pages in a two-volume work published by Basil Blackwel in 1992. This publication project was instigated largely by David Sudnow and Gail Jefferson, colleagues and students of Sacks at Berkeley, UCLA and Irvine, and includes an introduction by Emanuel Schegloff. In her acknowledgements in these volumes, Jefferson mentioned the help of Sudnow in dealing with Sacks's literary estate. The Harvey Sacks Memorial Association, registered as a not- for-profit Association, was formed by Sudnow. These Lectures have been important for Sacks's later influence and for the field of Conversation Analysis. Sudnow was a follower of Alfred Schutz in phenomenology, and Harold Garfinkel in ethnomethodology. Sudnow regards the work of Sacks as outside the ethnomethodological mainstream.

The union organises in all sectors from early years to further education and represents teachers in all roles including heads and deputies. It is the second largest teachers' union in the United Kingdom. The NASUWT is not affiliated to any political party, and seeks to influence educational policy on behalf of its members with national government and the devolved assemblies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The NASUWT today describes itself as union was born of teachers demanding a living wage and decent working conditions, a union that was made of teachers who said enough is enough and who were prepared to break from the status quo and to break new ground. It retains a representative democratic structure, premised on serving teachers representing serving teachers focused on exerting pressure and influence to secure the best for members.  The early years 1919‚Äì1976; breakaway and the formation of a new union  The origins of the NASUWT can be traced back to the formation of the National Association of Men Teachers (NAMT) in 1919, which formed as a group within the National Union of Teachers (NUT) to promote the interests of male teachers . The formation of the NAMT was in response to an NUT referendum the same year, approving the principle of equal pay for women. The NAMT continued its campaign to further the interests of male teachers, changing its name in 1920 to the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS). In 1922 the NAS broke away from the NUT and established it own organisation . The secession came about indirectly following a decision at the NAS Conference that year, to prohibit NAS members from continuing to also be members of the NUT after the 31 December 1922. The NAS aimed to recruit every schoolmaster into the NAS, to safeguard and promote the interests of male teachers, to ensure recognition of the social and economic responsibilities of male teachers, and to ensure the representation of schoolmasters on matters concerned with education, with both the Local Education Authorities (LEA‚Äôs) and Government. The NAS also maintained that all boys over the age of seven should be taught mainly by men and that schoolmasters should not serve under women heads. As the secondary education sector expanded, the NAS built its organisation among male secondary teachers, it adopted the methods of collective bargaining and militant industrial action in pursuing a narrow range of pay and conditions issues related to the interests of full-time male 'career teachers'. By the 1960s, the union was still opposed to admitting women as members, but it was concerned that the unions open to women teachers were all hostile to its objectives. As a result, it encouraged the formation of the Union of Women Teachers (UWT). In 1976 the NAS merged with the Union of Women Teachers (UWT) and the Scottish Schoolmasters Association (SSA). The merger was largely a consequence of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which made it unlawful to exclude from membership on grounds of gender. It then became the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers (NAS/UWT).M. Ironside and R. Seifert, Industrial Relations in Schools, (London: Routledge 1995), p.97 Subsequently the 'slash' separating the two sections of the union was later dropped and the name usually appeared subtitled 'The Career Teachers Union' - a reference to the life long commitment of the 'career' classroom teacher. Although from many years the union had officially registered its name with the Certification Office for Trade Unions ans Employers Associations as the NASUWT, it is only since 2015 that the union has adopted its name in the short form using only the initials NASUWThttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/822399/167T_2018.pdf and subtitled 'The Teachers' Union'. The change reflected that 84 per cent of its members were now women https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/822399/167T_2018.pdfand it was effectively able to remove from its name the now archaic term 'schoolmasters'.  Industrial relations, bargaining and strikes  The union as the National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) with 21,000 members attempt to seek representation in national pay negotiations known as the 'Burnham Committee' was rejected in 1960. The Burnham Committees however were dominated by representatives of the much larger National Union of Teachers (NUT) with a membership of 201,000. However following a series of strikes and rallies the NAS achieved recognition for national pay bargaining on the Burnham Committees in 1962. Despite a successful campaign, the NUT continued to hold the majority of seats. In 1969 for instance, the NUT had 15 members on the Teachers‚Äô Panel, with the NAS holding the 2 seats it achieved on joining the Committee in 1962. The NUT general secretary also held the joint secretaryship of the main Burnham Committees and the leadership of their Teachers' Panels for most of their existence. By the mid 1980s, the pay rises for teachers of the previous decade had been considerably eroded by inflation In February, 1985 the NASUWT along with other teaching unions withdrew 'goodwill' in pursuit of higher pay. Members refused to supervise at lunchtimes, attend meetings with parents outside school hours, or cover for absent colleagues. The dispute escalated and a series of strikes followed for a period of the next two years. By 1987 the divisions over strategy with other unions, notably the NUT, brought the dispute to an end. The result was the 1987 Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act, which abolished the national pay negotiations and replaced them with an Interim Advisory Committee on School Teachers' Pay and Conditions, on which the unions had no representation. This was in turn replaced in 1991 by The School Teachers‚Äô Review Body (STRB). An independent body to examine and report on such matters relating to the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales. Social partnership and work force reform From 2003 to 2010 the NASUWT was involved in \\"social partnership\\" ‚Äì a programme of meetings between union leaders, the Labour government and employers' organisations. The meetings were initially to discuss pay and workforce issues but developed into a forum for broader discussion on policy proposals. The National Union of Teachers chose not to participate in social partnership. The NASUWT argues that social partnership brought about benefits to teachers' terms and conditions through the \\"National Agreement ‚Äì Raising Standards, Tackling Workload\\", especially the introduction of defined planning and assessment time for all teachers. Social partnership was confined to the Labour government, and did not continue after the establishment of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010. Instead, the union lodged a formal trade dispute with the government over workload, conditions of service, pensions, and jobs. In November 2011, members of the NASUWT voted by a 4-to-1 margin (on a 39% turnout) to take strike action, and begin working to the letter of their contracts. The NASUWT set aside historical differences with the National Union of Teachers; a joint declaration in May 2012 led to a co-ordinated work-to-rule and strike action in autumn 2013. NASUWT campaigns The NASUWT has initiated a number of influential campaigns in recent years, including a campaign leading to the abolition of a code of conduct proposed by the General Teaching Council, a campaign recognising the effects of cyberbullying, a campaign to preserve the anonymity of teachers from malicious or false allegations, and a campaign to bar members of the British National Party from the teaching profession. After 2010, the union joined campaigns against the coalition government. It asserted that \\"the Education Act 2011 heralded the break-up of the entire state education service\\" and subsequently lobbied under the slogan \\"Reclaim the promise\\", harking back to the Education Act 1944. NASUWT encouraged its members to join marches sponsored by the TUC, and participated in the Robin Hood tax campaign. Location The headquarters is situated by the Licky Hills Counrty Park in North Worcestershire which borders the southern edge of the City of Birmingham (NASUWT Rose Hill, Rednal, Birmingham B45 8RS) The union also has nine regional centres in England, and national centres each of Northern Ireland, Wales/Cymru and Scotland.

As a counter to mainstream psychology's treatment of discourse as a \\"mirror\\" for people's expressions of thoughts, intentions, motives, etc., DP's founders made the case for picturing it instead as a \\"construction yard\\" wherein all such presumptively prior and independent notions of thought and so on were built from linguistic materials, topicalised and, in various less direct ways, handled and managed.Potter, J. (1996) Representing Reality. London: Sage. Here, the study of the psychological implies commitment not to the inner life of the mind, but rather, to the written and spoken practices within which people invoked, implicitly or explicitly, notions precisely like \\"the inner life of the mind\\".Edwards, D., Potter, J. (2005) Discursive psychology, mental states and descriptions, in L. te Molder, J. Potter (eds.) Conversation and Cognition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 241-259. Discursive psychology therefore starts with psychological phenomena as things that are constructed, attended to, and understood in interaction. An evaluation, say, may be constructed using particular phrases and idioms, responded to by the recipient (as a compliment perhaps) and treated as the expression of a strong position. In discursive psychology, the focus is not on psychological matters somehow leaking out into interaction; rather, interaction is the primary site where psychological issues are live. It is philosophically opposed to more traditional cognitivist approaches to language. It uses studies of naturally occurring conversation to critique the way that topics have been conceptualised and treated in psychology. History The origins of what is now termed \\"discursive psychology\\" can arguably be traced to the late 1980s, and the collaborative research and analysis sessions that took place as part of Loughborough University's then newly formed Discourse and Rhetoric Group (DARG). A key landmark was the publication of Jonathan Potter and Margaret Wetherell's classic text Discourse and social psychology: Beyond attitudes and behaviour in 1987. Charles Antaki, writing in the Times Higher Education Supplement, described the impact of this book: > Potter and Wetherell have genuinely presented us with a different way of > working in social psychology. The book's clarity means that it has the power > to influence a lot of people ill-at-ease with traditional social psychology > but unimpressed with (or simply bewildered by) other alternatives on offer. > It could rescue social psychology from the sterility of the laboratory and > its traditional mentalism. The field itself was originally labeled as DP during the early 1990s by Derek Edwards and Potter at Loughborough University. It has since been developed and extended by a number of others, including (but by no means limited to): Charles Antaki, Malcolm Ashmore, Frederick Attenborough, Bethan Benwell, Steve Brown, Carly Butler, Derek Edwards, Alexa Hepburn, Eric Laurier, Hedwig te Molder, Sue Speer, Liz Stokoe, Cristian Tileaga, Sally Wiggins and Sue Wilkinson. Discursive psychology draws on the philosophy of mind of Gilbert Ryle and the later Ludwig Wittgenstein, the rhetorical approach of Michael Billig, the ethnomethodology of Harold Garfinkel, the conversation analysis of Harvey Sacks and the sociology of scientific knowledge of those like Mike Mulkay, Steve Woolgar and Bruno Latour. The term \\"discursive psychology\\" was designed partly to indicate that there was not just a methodological shift at work in this form of analysis, but also, and at the same time, that it involved some fairly radical theoretical rethinking. Study Discursive psychology conducts studies of both naturally occurring and experimentally engineered human interaction that offer new ways of understanding topics in social and cognitive psychology such as memory and attitudes. Although discursive psychology subscribes to a different view of human mentality than is advanced by mainstream psychology, Edwards and Potter's work was originally motivated by their dissatisfaction with how psychology had treated discourse. In many psychological studies, the things people (subjects) say are treated as windows (with varying degrees of opacity) into their minds. Talk is seen as (and, in experimental psychology and protocol analysis, used as) descriptions of people's mental content. In contrast, discursive psychology treats talk as social action; that is, we say what we do as a means of, and in the course of, doing things in a socially meaningful world. Thus, the questions that it makes sense to ask also change. DP-in-action: an illustration DP can be illustrated with an example from Edwards' research on script formulations.Edwards, D. (1994) Script Formulations: An Analysis of Event Descriptions in Conversation, Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 13(3): 211-247. Traditional social psychology treats scripts as mentally encoded templates that guide action. Discursive psychology focuses on the foundational issue of how a description is built to present a course of action as following from a standardized routine. Take the following example from a couple counselling session (the transcription symbols here were developed by Gail Jefferson). The Counsellor says: \\"before you moved over here how was the marriage\\". After a delay of about half a second, Connie, the wife who is being jointly counselled, replies \\"Oh to me all along, right up to now, my marriage was rock solid. Rock solid = We had arguments like everybody else had arguments, but to me there was no major problems.\\" One thing that discursive psychologists would be interested in would be the way that Connie depicts the arguments that she and her partner have as the routine kind of arguments that everybody has. While arguments might be thought as a problem with a marriage, Connie \\"script formulates\\" them as actually characteristic of a \\"rock solid\\" marriage. Action and interaction is accomplished as orderly in interactions of this kind. Discursive psychology focuses on the locally organized practices for constructing the world to serve relevant activities (in this case managing the live question of who is to blame and who needs to change in the counselling). In the discursive psychological vision, scripts are an inseparable part of the practical and moral world of accountability. Applications of DP: spoken and textual approaches In the past few years, one particular strand of discursive psychological has focused its analytic gaze on spoken interaction. As a consequence, it has relied heavily on (but also contributed to the development of) the principles and practices of conversation analysis. Focusing on material drawn from real world situations such as relationship counselling, child protection helplines, neighbour disputes and family mealtimes, it has asked questions such as: How does a party in relationship counselling construct the problem as something that the other party needs to work on? How does a child protection officer working on a child protection helpline manage the possibly competing tasks of soothing a crying caller and simultaneously eliciting evidence sufficient for social services to intervene to help an abused child? And what makes a parent's request to a child to eat different from a directive, and different in turn from a threat? Although most recent DP oriented studies take talk-in- interaction as their primary data, it is not difficult to locate another strand of DP-related research in which texts are approached as sites for the active literary/narratorial management of matters such as agency, intent, doubt, culpability, belief, prejudice, and so on.Attenborough, F. (2015, forthcoming) A forgotten legacy? Towards a disursive psychology of the media, in C. Tileaga, E. Stokoe (eds.) Discursive Psychology: Classic and Contemporary Issues. London: Routledge. One of the founding studies for this kind of textual approach was \\"Who killed the Princess? Description and Blame in the British Print Press\\" by Derek Edwards and Katie MacMillan.MacMillan, K., Edwards, D. (1999) Who Killed the Princess? Description and Blame in the British Press, Discourse Studies, 1(2): 151-174 The \\"generally applicable discourse analytic approach\\" articulated and demonstrated therein has proved particularly useful for the study of media texts. Whereas traditional DP studies explore the situated, occasioned, rhetorical use of our rich common sense psychological lexicon across various forms of spoken data, this newer form of textual DP shows that and how authors use that same lexicon in order to present themselves (or others) as individuals and/or members of larger collectives that are (ab)normal, (ir)rational, (un)reasonable, etc. This approach has proved particularly productive in an age marked by the growth in usage of social media, SMS texts, photo messaging apps, blogs/vlogs, YouTube, interactive websites (etc.): never before have so many opportunities for explicitly public, accountably interactional and rhetorically motivated invocations of psychological terms been available to so many people.

(p. 61-2) While a student at Grinnell College (Iowa) in 1961, Bisson was one of a group of twelve students who traveled to Washington, D.C. during the Cuban Missile Crisis supporting U.S. President John F. Kennedy's \\"peace race\\". Kennedy invited the group into the White House (the first time protesters had ever been so recognized) and they met for several hours with McGeorge Bundy. The group received wide press coverage, and this event is regarded as the start of the student peace movement.Grinnell Magazine, Fall 2011: The Grinnell 14 Go to Washington After leaving Grinnell College, Bisson graduated from the University of Louisville in 1964. He lived \\"on and off\\" in New York City for most of the next four decades, moving to Oakland, California in 2002. He became a \\"working\\" writer in 1981. A self-identified member of the New Left, he operated Jacobin Books, a \\"revolutionary\\" mail-order book service, from 1985 to 1990, in partnership with Judy Jensen. Bisson has been married three times. He and his first wife, Deirdre Holst, have three children. His second marriage was to Mary Corey.

Bisson's first novel was Wyrldmaker, a science fiction novel influenced by James Blish's The Seedling Stars. His next novel was Talking Man (1986), a fantasy about the titular wizard living in the then- contemporary American South. In 1996, he wrote two three-part comic book adaptations of Nine Princes in Amber and The Guns of Avalon, the first two books in Roger Zelazny's \\"Amber\\" series. In 1997, Bisson used Walter M.

History  The Tai Situpa is one of the highest-ranking lamas of the Karma Kagyu lineage. Chokyi Gyaltsen was the first to bear the title \\"Grand Situ\\" (), conferred upon him in 1407 by the Yongle Emperor of Ming China. He was a close disciple of Deshin Shekpa, 5th Karmapa Lama, who appointed him abbot of Karma Goen, the Karmapa's principal monastery at the time. The full title bestowed was Kenting Naya Tang Nyontse Geshetse Tai Situpa which is shortened to Kenting Tai Situ. The full title means \\"far reaching, unshakable, great master, holder of the command\\".History of Tibet ‚Äì A Few Chapters (Part 3) The 9th Karmapa bestowed the 5th Kenting Tai Situpa a Red Vajra Crown of Radiant Gold, which mirrored the Karmapa's own Black Vajra Crown. The Red Crown symbolizes the inseparability of the Karmapa and Kenting Tai Situpa. Through seeing the Red Crown, which is presented in a ceremony even today by the Kenting Tai Situpa, one is instantly and irreversibly set onto the path of enlightenment and receives the blessing of the Bodhisattva Maitreya. The current, 12th Tai Situpa, Pema T√∂ny√∂ Nyinje, was born in a farming family named Liyultsang in 1954 in the village of Palmey, which is part of Palyul () or Baiy√º County, Sichuan, China that was formerly part of the Kingdom of Derge. The Palpung Thupten Chokhorling monastery in Derge was founded by the 8th Tai Situpa \\"Situ Panchen\\" in 1727, where presently all the traditional Buddhist teachings are taught to the monks and has preserved traditional printing centre for the Buddhist teaching scrolls. At the age of twenty-two, the 12th Tai Situpa founded his own new monastic seat, Palpung Sherabling Monastery, Himachal Pradesh, in Northeast India providing traditional Buddhist teachings, astronomy, traditional Tibetan medicine curriculum, higher Tibetan Buddhist university teaching (Shedra), primary teachings to young students, sports facility for students for physical fitness, traditional Tibetan herbs medicine garden, medical clinic , old age home and has accommodations for students. Palpung Sherabling Monastery currently has approximately 1000 monks; 250 are enrolled in the monastic university curriculum on the premises. Palpung Yeshe Rabgyeling Nun Monastery is located near the city of Manali, in the Bunthar town has about 200 nuns. The Monastery also offers the traditional Kagyu three-year retreat for both monks and nuns on the compound. The Palpung congregation[10] consists of monasteries and temples throughout some Chinese and Tibetan districts. Palpung Congregation also has branch institutions in Europe, USA, Canada Oceania and Asia. The 12th Tai Situpa traveled widely, making his first visit to the West in 1981 to Kagyu Samye Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre in Scotland.Biography of 12th Tai Situpa The 12th Tai Situpa was instrumental in recognizing Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa, whom he enthroned at the Tsurphu Monastery the traditional ancient seat of the Karmapa outside Lhasa in August 1992. He also recognized Choseng Trungpa, born on February 6, 1989 in Chamdo County, Tibet Autonomous Region, as the reincarnation of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa.

Geography Wilno is nestled in the rolling, picturesque terrain of the Madawaska valley which was largely shaped during the demise of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at the end of the last North American Ice Age. History Wilno is the first and oldest Polish settlement in Canada. The original settlers in this area, circa 1858, were from the Kaszuby region Kashubian from the then Prussian area of Poland. They constitute an integral part of what has been called the Kashubian diaspora.Blank, Joshua C. Creating Kashubia: History, Memory and Identity in Canada's First Polish Community. (Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2019 One of the reasons they chose this area to settle was because of the landscape which reminded them of their original homes. Rolling Madawaska Hills Hwy 60 Wilno's namesake was the city of Vilnius (Wilno in Polish), then in a Russian-occupied area of Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, now capital of Lithuania, the birthplace of Reverend Ludwik Dembski, who was a prominent community spiritual leader and town founder, who would not have wanted the town named after himself. Therefore, the townsfolk, grateful for his contributions to their town, may have suggested the name of Wilno.Stories of WilnoCanada's First Polish Settlement The first church, known as St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, was built in 1875, destroyed by fire in 1936 and rebuilt as Saint Mary - Our Lady of Czestochowa. It is now known as St. Mary's Catholic Church. The first general store and post office was initially operated by Adam Prince (1855-1933) who became the community's first postmaster in 1885. The settlement was initially named Princetown before being renamed Wilno. Flora‚Äôs Store was started by Flora Bank in 1937; it was destroyed by fire in 1940 but rebuilt. The business went through several owners and changes but was closed down in 2015.Stories of Wilno[http://www.stmaryswilno.com/history.html Wit√≥m√´ w Wilno - Witamy w Wilno - Welcome to Wilno] In 1894 the Canadian Atlantic railroad arrived in the Madawaska Valley.Stories of Wilno Previously, John Rudolphus Booth's Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway ran through the town mainly serving the lumber industry. The first hotel near the Wilno rail station was the \\"Stopping Place\\"; a new owner added more rooms and a dining room, and re-named it the \\"Exchange Hotel\\". Subsequent owners modified the property and it became the \\"Wilno Tavern\\" in 1979 and the \\"Wilno Tavern Restaurant\\" more recently.Stories of Wilno The restaurant remained in operation as of 2020; Corinne Higgins has owned it since 1981.Dining Out With History The former train route has now been redeveloped into a recreational path. Where the former train station was located, an early settler building and museum that present the early history of the town was built. The museum and open air wooden skansen (Swedish for \\"ethnographic museum\\") contain the history of the first Kashubian people as well as their immigration to Canada, freedom and eventually, after many hardships, their settlement journey to the Wilno area. The Polish Kashub Heritage Museum & Skansen opened in 2002.

The Confluence of the Abbey and Shannon Rivers at the Potato Market King's Island is an area of central Limerick, Ireland.King's Island Limerick. The area is often referred to colloquially as The Island and consists of two distinct areas, Englishtown and St Mary's Park. The historical city of Limerick known as Englishtown is located on the southern end and St Mary's Park; a local authority housing estate is located on the northern end. The island is formed from a distributary of the River Shannon. The Abbey River diverts from the Shannon before meeting it again at a confluence near the Potato Market. The island probably took its name after the 13th-century English King John's Castle was built. However, a 150AD map by Ptolemy shows a place called 'Regia' at the same site as King's Island, and history suggests the presence of earlier settlements in the area. The island's location offers an ideal defensive position at a natural river crossing. Englishtown Athlunkard Street. In times past, the ancient city of Limerick itself was entirely contained in the area now known as Englishtown as a walled city. The Vikings established the city in this area following the Viking Invasion of Ireland. After the Norman Invasion of Ireland, the city was taken by Norman or Old English settlers. It is from this time that the area became referred to as Englishtown and also to distinguish it from Irishtown south of the Abbey River which was populated by native Irish. It was during the Norman Conquest that many of the city's landmarks were built in this district such as the 13th century King John's Castle and the 800-year-old St Mary's Cathedral. Nicholas Street and Mary Street on the island formed the medieval city centre of Limerick and are perhaps the oldest streets in the city. Samuel Lewis writing in 1837 in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland describes Limerick's old city of Englishtown as resembling the city of Rouen, Normandy with the housing built in Flemish fashion. Even by then though there is evidence the district was in decline as he describes the area as exhibiting a 'dirty & neglected appearance'. Following the development of Newtown Pery the city centre shifted south to the present day centre of the city and the Englishtown area lost its position as the fashionable area of the city. By the late 18th Century the old continental style cramped lofty Dutch & Flemish houses that once characterised the area were transformed into tenements and rented to Limerick's poorest. Englishtown became characterised by poverty, slum living and squalor. All of the slums were cleared in the early to mid 20th Century, resulting in the loss of most of the areas historical built heritage such as the collection of Flemish townhouses, Ireton's Castle, the Exchange building, the Tholsel amongst much more. Unfortunately many buildings and shops in the area remain derelict or in deteriorating conditions today. St Mary's Park St Mary's Park is a local authority housing estate located on the northern part of the island known as the Island Field. As one of the most deprived areas in Limerick city, it is earmarked as part of the overall Limerick city regeneration project which will see the estate replanned and rebuilt with greater integration to the city. Landmarks St Marys Cathedral, Limerick King John's Castle As the most historic and ancient part of Limerick, King's Island and the Englishtown area contains many notable buildings and landmarks such as: * King John's Castle, Castle Street, dates from the 13th Century * St Mary's Cathedral, Bridge Street, dates from the 14th Century * Limerick City Museum, Merchant's Quay * Old Bishop's Palace, (now headquarters of Limerick Civic Trust), Castle Street, c1750 * St Munchin's Church (now the Island Theatre Company), Church Street, c1825 * Villier's Almhouses, Verdant Place, c1820 * (Royal) Military Cemetery, King's Island, which dates from 1856 * Bourke's Castle, Athlunkard Street * Fanning's Castle, Mary Street, c1641 * City Courthouse, Merchants Quay, c1800 * Barrington's Hospital, George's Quay * St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Athlunkard Street * Exchange Walls (formerly the Exchange Building), Nicholas Street * Ruins of the old Dominican Friary, Bishop Street * Limerick City Hall & Civic Buildings, Merchants Quay * Baal's Bridge dates from 1830 replacing an earlier structure (which connected Irishtown to Englishtown in medieval times). The bridge is also known for the Baal's Bridge Square. When the new bridge was constructed in 1830 an old brass square of Freemasonry symbolism was found in the foundations of the original bridge with a date inscribed to 1517. The Square is reputed to be one of the earliest Masonic items found in the world.

They are mentioned briefly in Ptolemy's Geography, and there is no other historical record of them. Their cultural and ethnic affinity is commonly assumed to have been Brittonic. Assertions that the Solway Firth preserves the name of the Selgovae are without foundation. 'Solway' is Anglo- Saxon from the thirteenth century (sol = 'mud', w√¶th = 'ford'), and this was the name of the main crossing at Eskmouth at that time. The firth has been known by various names in the past, and this one happened to be the survivor.  The historical record  = Ptolemy = 240px The sole record of the Selgovae and their towns is their mention by Ptolemy in c. 150. Their name appears in the 8th century Ravenna Cosmography as 'Segloes',, Ravenna Cosmography but the document here is taken to be an imperfect copy of classical sources such as Ptolemy, and not an independent historical reference. The Novantae are unique among the peoples that Ptolemy names in that their location is reliably known to have been in Galloway due to the way he named several readily identifiable physical features. Since the Selgovae were adjacent to them, their homeland is similarly known. Ptolemy said that the towns of the Selgovae were Carbantorigum, Uxellum, Corda, and Trimontium. However, there were no towns as such in the area at that time, so he was probably referring to Roman military camps and native strong points such as duns. In the Ravenna Cosmography the town names appear as Carbantium, Uxela, Corda, and Trimuntium, resp., and the towns are given in a list that does not associate any of the towns with any particular people., Ravenna Cosmography Efforts have been made to determine the locations of the towns, but there is not enough information available to reach any degree of certainty, and the locations suggested are little more than guesswork. In the 19th Century, Carbantorigum was thought to be the Motte of Urr by Skene, and Rhys thought the name derived from Carbantorion (chariot town). Uxellum was at Wardlaw Hill at Caerlaverock according to Skene and Horsley; it was noted that the name sounds like Welsh uchel (high) or Gaelic uas, uasal. Corda was at Sanquhar, according to Skene. Trimontium was at Birrenswark Hill, according to Skene, who says its name probably represents Welsh Tref mynydd (Town on a Mountain)., Celtic Scotland, Vol. I Rhys, agreeing with Wyntoun, thought that 'Selgovae' means 'the hunters' (, , 'hunting'). Celtic Britain = Roman Era = 240px Archaeological evidence indicates that the Selgovae lived in two principal settlement types: stone-built huts and so-called \\"scooped enclosures\\", some of which were abandoned in the 1st century AD while others were established in the 2nd century and developed into multivallate structures. They had possibly lived in the area since the Bronze Age, and certainly during the pre-Roman Iron Age. The pattern of forts subsequently established in the area by the Romans suggests that the Selgovae lived in a number of distinct communities and probably had some degree of tribal and political organisation, perhaps influenced by individuals who had fled the Roman advance further south. They are thought to have had a tribal centre at Eildon Hill North near Melrose. They built a significant number of hillforts, more so than their neighbours, which may explain why the Romans targeted them before the relatively less organised and therefore less threatening tribes to the west and north. In his account of the campaigns of Gnaeus Julius Agricola (governor 78 ‚Äì 84), Tacitus says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay, campaigning against the peoples there. He did not return until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the lands that he had conquered., Life of Agricola, Chapters 19 ‚Äì 23. The territory of the Selgovae was substantially planted with Roman forts at this time, at Broomholm, Blatobulgium (Birrens), Ward Law, Milton, Drumlanrig, Dalswinton, and at Glenlochar on the eastern bank of the River Dee, which was perhaps the boundary between the Selgovae and the neighbouring Novantae., Britannia This suggests (but does not confirm) that the Selgovae were among the British peoples who had strongly resisted Roman occupation. This is in contrast to the neighbouring Novantae, where there are no signs of Roman occupation save the fortlet at Gatehouse of Fleet, in the southeast of their territory. Following the reorganisation of northern Roman Britain and the construction of Hadrian's Wall (c. 122), the only Roman forts in Selgovae territory were at Birrens and Netherby., Britannia However, with the construction of the Antonine Wall and the re-occupation of territory north of Hadrian's Wall (c. 142), Selgovae territory was again heavily planted with Roman forts, at Netherby, Broomholm, Birrens, Burnswark, Raeburnfoot, Shieldhill, Milton, Drumlanrig, Dalswinton, Carzield, Lantonside, and Glenlochar., Britannia There were no Roman forts planted in the territory of the neighbouring Novantae. When Rome largely abandoned its occupation of territory north of Hadrian's Wall under the reorganisation of Marcus Aurelius (c. 175), they nevertheless retained forts at Birrens and Netherby,, Britannia though there would never again be a large-scale military occupation of Selgovae territory. Rome permanently abandoned Selgovae territory by 370., Britannia = Cultural affinity = The ethnic and cultural affinity of the Selgovae is assumed to have been Brittonic and there have been suggestions that they were an integral part of the tribe of the Brigantes. Archaeological evidence is scant, but it includes a Roman-era figure and inscription found at Birrens (the Roman Blatobulgium) that was dedicated to 'Brigantia', similar to dedications found in known Brigantian territory in Cumbria and Yorkshire. Tacitus says that the Brigantes were a large tribe,, Life of Agricola, Chapter 17 and artefacts associated with the Brigantes have been found across the region just north of Hadrian's Wall, both in England and in Scottish Dumfriesshire and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. The Brigantes were troublesome to Roman rule, strongly resisting initial Roman occupation and frequently rising in efforts to throw off Roman rule. The Roman response was overwhelming force and the subsequent heavy plantation of forts of occupation. The heavy plantation of forts in Selgovae territory is similar to the Roman occupation of the Brigantes and unlike Roman treatment of other neighbouring peoples such as the Novantae and Votadini, who were never known to be at war with the Romans, and who were not heavily occupied. Much later history, better recorded, shows that the territory of the Selgovae was continually associated with Cumbria (homeland of the Brigantes) and Alt Clud (homeland of the Damnonii), both of which are known to have been Britonnic in culture and language.  Contradicting Ptolemy  Ptolemy's placement of the Selgovaean town of Trimontium was accepted to be somewhere along the southern coast of Scotland until William Roy (1726‚Äì1790) placed it far to the east at Eildon Hills, near Newstead. Roy was trying to follow an itinerary given in the 1757 De Situ Britanniae, and moving Ptolemy's Trimontium made the itinerary seem more logical according to his historical work, Military Antiquities of the Romans in North Britain (1790, published posthumously in 1793). Roy did not alter Ptolemy's placement of the Selgovae in southern Scotland, but chose to assign Trimontium to a different people who were described in De Situ Britanniae., Military Antiquities, Book IV, Chapter III Location of the Selgovae town of Trimontium according to Roy, who was trying to reconcile problems with the spurious De Situ Britanniae. When De Situ Britanniae was debunked as a fraud in 1845, Roy's misguided placement of Trimontium was retained by some historians, though he was no longer cited for his contribution. Furthermore, some historians not only accepted Roy's placement of Trimontium, but also returned the town to the Selgovae by moving their territory such that they would be near Eildon Hills. Ptolemy's placement of the Novantae in Galloway was retained, and since Ptolemy said that they were adjacent to the Selgovae, Novantae territory was greatly expanded beyond Galloway to be consistent with this thesis, which survives in a number of modern histories. ‚Äì see, for example, the influential Iron Age Communities in Britain, map of the tribes of Northern Britain, attributed to \\"various sources\\" The result is that an 'error correction' to the sole legitimate historical reference (Ptolemy), made so that a fictional itinerary in De Situ Britanniae would seem more logical, is retained; and the sole legitimate historical reference is further 'corrected' by moving the Selgovae far from their only known location. While Roy's historical work is largely ignored due to his unknowing reliance on a fraudulent source, his maps and drawings are untainted, and continue to be held in the highest regard. Roy's work is highly supported by the town Selkirk, which relates to the church of the Selgovae  See also  * Ptolemy's Geography * Roman Britain * Scotland during the Roman Empire Citations References       Tribes of ancient Scotland Celtic Britons Scotland in the Roman era 2nd century in Scotland Historical Celtic peoples Tribes mentioned by Ptolemy ","title":"Selgovae"},{"id":"989113","text":"These are lists of U.S. county name etymologies.

It first appeared in the magazine Belgravia, a publication known for its sensationalism, and was presented in twelve monthly installments from January to December 1878. Because of the novel's controversial themes, Hardy had some difficulty finding a publisher; reviews, however, though somewhat mixed, were generally positive. In the twentieth century, The Return of the Native became one of Hardy's most popular and highly regarded novels.Oxford Reader's Companion to Hardy (Norman Page, editor). Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 375‚Äì7. Plot summary The novel takes place entirely in the environs of Egdon Heath, and, with the exception of the epilogue, Aftercourses, covers exactly a year and a day. The narrative begins on the evening of Guy Fawkes Night as Diggory Venn is slowly crossing the heath with his van, which is being drawn by ponies. In his van is a passenger. When darkness falls, the country folk light bonfires on the surrounding hills, emphasising the pagan spirit of the heath and its denizens. Venn is a reddleman; he travels the country supplying farmers with a red mineral called reddle (dialect term for red ochre) that farmers use to mark their sheep. Although his trade has stained him red from head to foot, underneath his devilish colouring he is a handsome, shrewd, well-meaning young man. His passenger is a young woman named Thomasin Yeobright, whom Venn is taking home. Earlier that day, Thomasin had planned to marry Damon Wildeve, a local innkeeper known for his fickleness; however, an inconsistency in the marriage licence delayed the marriage. Thomasin, in distress, ran after the reddleman's van and asked him to take her home. Venn himself is in love with Thomasin, and unsuccessfully wooed her two years before. Now, although he believes Wildeve is unworthy of her love, he is so devoted to her that he is willing to help her secure the man of her choice. At length, Venn reaches Bloom's End, the home of Thomasin's aunt, Mrs. Yeobright. She is a good woman, if somewhat proud and inflexible, and she wants the best for Thomasin. In former months she opposed her niece's choice of husband, and publicly forbade the banns; now, since Thomasin has compromised herself by leaving town with Wildeve and returning unmarried, the best outcome Mrs. Yeobright can envision is for the postponed marriage to be duly solemnised as soon as possible. She and Venn both begin working on Wildeve to make sure he keeps his promise to Thomasin. Wildeve, however, is still preoccupied with Eustacia Vye, an exotically beautiful young woman living with her grandfather in a lonely house on Egdon Heath. Eustacia is a black-haired, queenly woman, whose Italian father came from Corfu, and who grew up in Budmouth, a fashionable seaside resort. She holds herself aloof from most of the heathfolk; they, in turn, consider her an oddity, and some even think she's a witch. She is nothing like Thomasin, who is sweet-natured. She loathes the heath, yet roams it constantly, carrying a spyglass and an hourglass. The previous year, she and Wildeve were lovers; however, even during the height of her passion for him, she knew she only loved him because there was no better object available. When Wildeve broke off the relationship to court Thomasin, Eustacia's interest in him briefly returned. The two meet on Guy Fawkes night, and Wildeve asks her to run off to America with him. She demurs. Eustacia drops Wildeve when Mrs. Yeobright's son Clym, a successful diamond merchant, returns from Paris to his native Egdon Heath. Although he has no plans to return to Paris or the diamond trade and is, in fact, planning to become a schoolmaster for the rural poor, Eustacia sees him as a way to escape the hated heath and begin a grander, richer existence in a glamorous new location. With some difficulty, she arranges to meet Clym, and the two soon fall in love. When Mrs. Yeobright objects, Clym quarrels with her; later, she quarrels with Eustacia as well. \\"Unconscious of her presence, he still went on singing.\\" Eustacia watches Clym cut furze in this illustration by Arthur Hopkins for the original Belgravia edition (Plate 8, July 1878). When he sees that Eustacia is lost to him, Wildeve marries Thomasin, who gives birth to a daughter the next summer. Clym and Eustacia also marry and move to a small cottage five miles away, where they enjoy a brief period of happiness. The seeds of rancour soon begin to germinate, however: Clym studies night and day to prepare for his new career as a schoolmaster while Eustacia clings to the hope that he'll give up the idea and take her abroad. Instead, he nearly blinds himself with too much reading, then further mortifies his wife by deciding to eke out a living, at least temporarily, as a furze-cutter. Eustacia, her dreams blasted, finds herself living in a hut on the heath, chained by marriage to a lowly labouring man. At this point, Wildeve reappears; he has unexpectedly inherited a large sum of money, and is now in a better position to fulfill Eustacia's hopes. He comes calling on the Yeobrights in the middle of one hot August day and, although Clym is at home, he is fast asleep on the hearth after a gruelling session of furze-cutting. While Eustacia and Wildeve are talking, Mrs. Yeobright knocks on the door; she has decided to pay a courtesy call in the hopes of healing the estrangement between herself and her son. Eustacia looks out at her and then, in some alarm, ushers her visitor out at the back door. She hears Clym calling to his mother and, thinking his mother's knocking has awakened him, remains in the garden for a few moments. When Eustacia goes back inside, she finds Clym still asleep and his mother gone. Clym, she now realises, merely cried out his mother's name in his sleep. Mrs Yeobright, it turns out, saw Eustacia looking out the window at her; she also saw Clym's gear by the door, and so knew they were both at home. Now, thinking she has been deliberately barred from her son's home, she miserably begins the long, hot walk home. Later that evening, Clym, unaware of her attempted visit, heads for Bloom's End and on the way finds her crumpled beside the path, dying from an adder's bite. When she expires that night from the combined effects of snake venom and heat exhaustion, Clym's grief and remorse make him physically ill for several weeks. Eustacia, racked with guilt, dares not tell him of her role in the tragedy; when he eventually finds out from a neighbour's child about his mother's visit‚Äîand Wildeve's‚Äîhe rushes home to accuse his wife of murder and adultery. Eustacia refuses to explain her actions; instead, she tells him You are no blessing, my husband and reproaches him for his cruelty. She then moves back to her grandfather's house, where she struggles with her despair while she awaits some word from Clym. Wildeve visits her again on Guy Fawkes night, and offers to help her get to Paris. Eustacia realises that if she lets Wildeve help her, she'll be obliged to become his mistress. She tells him she will send him a signal by night if she decides to accept. Clym's anger, meanwhile, has cooled and he sends Eustacia a letter the next day offering reconciliation. The letter arrives a few minutes too late; by the time her grandfather tries to give it to her, she has already signalled to Wildeve and set off through wind and rain to meet him. She walks along weeping, however, knowing she is about to break her marriage vows for a man who is unworthy of her. Wildeve readies a horse and gig and waits for Eustacia in the dark. Thomasin, guessing his plans, sends Clym to intercept him; she also, by chance, encounters Diggory Venn as she dashes across the heath herself in pursuit of her husband. Eustacia does not appear; instead, she falls or throws herself into nearby Shadwater Weir. Clym and Wildeve hear the splash and hurry to investigate. Wildeve plunges recklessly after Eustacia without bothering to remove his coat, while Clym, proceeding more cautiously, nevertheless is also soon at the mercy of the raging waters. Venn arrives in time to save Clym, but is too late for the others. When Clym revives, he accuses himself of murdering his wife and mother. In the epilogue, Venn gives up being a reddleman to become a dairy farmer. Two years later, Thomasin marries him and they settle down happily together. Clym, now a sad, solitary figure, eventually takes up preaching. =Alternative ending= In a footnote towards the end of the novel in some compendium editions, Hardy writes: Discussion With its deeply flawed heroine and its (for the time) open acknowledgement of illicit sexual relationships, The Return of the Native raised some eyebrows when it first appeared as a serial in Victorian Britain. Although he intended to structure the novel into five books, thus mirroring the classical tragic format, Hardy submitted to the tastes of the serial-reading public sufficiently to tack on a happy ending for Diggory Venn and Thomasin in a sixth book, Aftercourses. In Hardy's original conception, Venn retains his weird reddleman's character, while Thomasin lives out her days as a widow.Oxford Reader's Companion to Hardy, ibid. Hardy's choice of themes‚Äîsexual politics, thwarted desire, and the conflicting demands of nature and society‚Äîmakes this a truly modern novel. Underlying these modern themes, however, is a classical sense of tragedy: Hardy scrupulously observes the three unities of time, place, and action and suggests that the struggles of those trying to escape their destinies will only hasten their destruction.Asquith, Mark. \\"A drama of grandeur and unity: Egdon Heath in The Return of the Native\\". The English Review, 14.1 (Sept 2003): 21(3) To emphasise this main part he uses as setting an ancient heath steeped in pre-Christian history and supplies a Chorus consisting of Grandfer Cantle, Timothy Fairway, and the rest of the heathfolk. Eustacia, who manipulates fate in hopes of leaving Egdon Heath for a larger existence in Paris, instead becomes an eternal resident when she drowns in Shadwater Weir; Wildeve shares not only Eustacia's dream of escape, but also her fate; and Clym, the would-be educational reformer, survives the Weir but lives on as a lonely, remorseful man. Some critics‚Äînotably D. H. Lawrence‚Äîsee the novel as a study of the way communities control their misfits. In Egdon Heath, most people (particularly the women) look askance at the proud, unconventional Eustacia. Mrs. Yeobright considers her too odd and unreliable to be a suitable bride for her son, and Susan Nunsuch, who frankly believes her to be a witch, tries to protect her children from Eustacia's supposedly baleful influence by stabbing her with a stocking pin and later burning her in effigy. Clym at first laughs at such superstitions, but later embraces the majority opinion when he rejects his wife as a murderer and adulteress. In this view, Eustacia dies because she has internalised the community's values to the extent that, unable to escape Egdon without confirming her status as a fallen woman, she chooses suicide. She thereby ends her sorrows while at the same time‚Äîby drowning in the weir like any woman instead of floating, witchlike‚Äîshe proves her essential innocence to the community.Malton, Sara A. \\"The woman shall bear her iniquity: Death as social discipline in The Return of the Native\\". Studies in the Novel, Summer 2000.  Character list  * Clement (Clym) Yeobright‚ÄîA man of about thirty who gives up a business career in Paris to return to his native Egdon Heath to become a ‚Äúschoolmaster to the poor and ignorant‚Äù (Hardy himself gave up a successful career as a London architect and returned to his native Dorchester to become a writer). \\"The beauty here visible would in no time be ruthlessly overrun by its parasite, thought.\\" Clym is the \\"native\\" to which the book's title refers. * Eustacia Vye‚ÄîA raven-haired young beauty, of half-Italian ancestry, who chafes against her life on the heath and longs to escape it to lead the more adventure-filled life of the world. Some of the heathfolk think she is a witch. Hardy describes her as \\"the raw material of a divinity\\" whose \\"celestial imperiousness, love, wrath, and fervour had proved to be somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon.\\" * Mrs. Yeobright‚ÄîClym‚Äôs mother, a widow of inflexible standards. Thomasin has lived with her for many years, but Clym is her only child. She strongly disapproves of Eustacia. * Thomasin (Tamsin) Yeobright‚ÄîClym‚Äôs cousin and Mrs. Yeobright's niece, a young girl of gentle ways and conventional expectations. In Hardy's original manuscript, Wildeve tricks her with a false marriage to seduce her. \\"Mrs Yeobright saw a little figure...undefended except by the power of her own hope.\\" * Damon Wildeve‚ÄîEustacia's former lover and Thomasin's first husband. He is an ex-engineer who has failed in his profession and who now keeps an inn, \\"The Quiet Woman\\"‚Äîso-called because its sign depicts a decapitated woman carrying her own head. He has a wandering eye and an appetite for women. \\"A lady killing career.\\" * Diggory Venn‚ÄîA resourceful man of twenty-four and a reddleman (a travelling seller of reddle, red chalk used for marking sheep). He selflessly protects Thomasin throughout the novel despite the fact that she refused to marry him two years before. He keeps a watchful eye on Eustacia to make sure Wildeve doesn't go back to her. At the end, he renounces his trade to become a dairy farmer like his father, and in doing so loses the red skin. He is then seen as a suitable husband for Thomasin. Venn's red coloration and frequent narrative references to his 'Mephistophelean' or diabolical character are symbolic and important. In one particularly significant chapter (\\"The Morning and Evening of an Eventful Day\\"), Venn displays an increasingly unlikely string of good luck, repeatedly rolling dice and defeating a rival. This event makes Venn something of a deus ex machina, as well as a quasi- magical figure. While Hardy abandons these aspects of Venn's character by the end of the novel, during his 'reddleman' phase, Venn lends elements of magical realism and what modern readers would understand to be superheroic elements to the novel. * Captain Drew‚ÄîEustacia‚Äôs grandfather and a former naval officer (renamed Captain Vye in later editions). * Timothy Fairway‚ÄîA sententious man of middle age who is greatly respected by the other heathfolk. * Grandfer Cantle‚ÄîA somewhat senile and always lively ex-soldier of about sixty-nine. * Christian Cantle‚ÄîGrandfer Cantle's fearful and timid thirty-one-year-old son. * Humphrey‚ÄîClym's eventual colleague, a furze cutter (furze is a low, prickly shrub more commonly called gorse). * Susan Nunsuch‚ÄîEustacia's nearest neighbour and bitterest enemy who convinces herself that Eustacia's witchery has caused her son's sickliness. In a memorable scene, Susan tries to protect him by making a wax effigy of Eustacia, sticking it full of pins, and melting it in her fireplace while uttering the Lord's Prayer backward. Eustacia drowns later that night. * Johnny Nunsuch‚ÄîSusan‚Äôs son, a young boy. He encounters Mrs. Yeobright during her fatal walk home and, in obedience to her wishes, reports her last words to Clym: I am a broken-hearted woman cast off by my son. * Charley‚ÄîA sixteen-year-old boy who works for Captain Drew and who admires Eustacia, largely from afar. * Egdon Heath‚ÄîThe setting for all the novel's events; considered by some critics to be the leading character as well.Asquith, Mark. ibid. It is profoundly ancient, the scene of intense but long-forgotten pagan lives. As its tumuli attest, it is also a graveyard that has swallowed countless generations of inhabitants without changing much itself. To Thomasin, Clym, and Diggory, it is a benign, natural place; in Eustacia's eyes, it becomes a malevolent presence intent on destroying her.

Life Jonathan Potter was born in Ashford, Kent, and spent most of his childhood in the village of Laughton, East Sussex; his father was a school teacher and his mother was a batik artist. He went to School in Lewes and then on to a degree in Psychology at the University of Liverpool in 1974 where he was exposed to the radical politics of the city, became (briefly) interested in alternative therapies, and responded to the traditional British empirical psychology that was the mainstay of the Liverpool psychology degree programme at the time. He read the work of John Shotter, Kenneth Gergen and Rom Harr√© and became excited by the so-called crisis in social psychology. This critical work led him to a master's degree in philosophy of science at the University of Surrey where he worked on speech act theory and had a first exposure to post structuralism and in particular the work of Roland Barthes. He read and wrote about Thomas Kuhn, Paul Feyerabend and Imre Lakatos. At the same time, philosophy of science provided a pathway to the new sociology of scientific knowledge and in particular to the work of Harry Collins, Michael Mulkay and Steve Woolgar. In 1979 he applied for a PhD funding at the University of Bath to work with Harry Collins. He was offered a place but in the summer of 1979 the offer was withdrawn after the incoming Thatcher government cut the budget for social science. He started a part-time PhD with Peter Stringer in Psychology at the University of Surrey, while also working on a project on overseas tourists' experiences of Bath's bed and breakfast hotels. In this period he met and started to live with Margaret Wetherell, who was doing a PhD with John Turner and was, with Howard Giles and Henri Tajfel, one of the key figures in British social psychology. He took part in the vibrant intellectual culture of social psychology in Bristol at the time although he was a lone voice against the broadly experimental focus of Bristol tradition of so-called European Social Psychology. When Peter Stringer left Surrey to move to a Chair in the Netherlands Potter applied for DPhil funding again and started to work with Michael Mulkay at the University of York. He worked within the sociology of scientific knowledge tradition, focusing on recordings of psychologists debating with one another at conferences. Increasingly that work evolved into an analysis of scientific discourse. When Margaret Wetherell was appointed to a post in St Andrews University in 1980 he moved to Scotland, doing his PhD long distance. In 1983 he gained his DPhil and started a temporary job whose primary duty was to teach statistics in the Psychological Laboratory (as the department was called at the time). Covering the statistics allowed him a lot of flexibility in other teaching and he developed a course simply called Discourse which covered speech act theory, implicature, semiotics, post-structuralism, critical linguistics and conversation analysis. The intensive engagement with this range of thinking influenced much of his later work. After 4 years of temporary contracts at St Andrews he was offered a post at Loughborough University where he taught until July 2015, first as lecturer, then Reader in Discourse Analysis from 1992, then Professor of Discourse Analysis from 1996, and Head of Department from February 2010. At Loughborough he worked with and was influenced by Derek Edwards, Michael Billig, Charles Antaki and, more recently, Elizabeth Stokoe. Since 1996 he has lived with, and collabored with, Alexa Hepburn. In the last decade he has taught workshops and short courses in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Venezuela, New Zealand, Australia, US and the UK. In 2005 his book Cognition and Conversation (jointly edited with Hedwig te Molder) received the inaugural prize of the American Sociological Association Ethnomethodology and Conversation Analysis section in 2007. In 2008 he was elected to UK Academy of Social Sciences. Work In 1984 he published Social Texts and Context: Literature and Social Psychology with Margaret Wetherell and Peter Stringer. This collaboration was devoped in parallel to Potter and Wetherell's PhD work. He is co-author, with Margaret Wetherell of the influential book Discourse and Social Psychology which is one of the foundational texts that developed a discourse analytic approach to social psychology, a programme now refined into discursive psychology. It offered new ways of conceptualizing fundamental social psychological notions such as attitudes, categories, social representations and rules. It has been cited more than three thousand times in more than a hundred different journals. One of its central achievements was to develop the analytic notion of 'interpretative repertoires' from Gilbert and Mulkay's work on scientific discourse and show how it could be more generally applied to social psychological topics. A joint grant led by Margaret Wetherell resulted in the volume Mapping the Language of Racism in 1992 that focused on the way racism is displayed and legitimated in conversations, newspaper articles and parliamentary debates. At the start of the 1990s, in the book Discursive Psychology, he and Derek Edwards built a specific style of work that is now commonplace in journals across the social sciences as well as indirectly fostering a swathe of non-experimental approaches to social psychology. This took on core notions in cognitive psychology and in particular memory and attribution. Its aim was to show that existing cognitive conceptions of these notions failed to encompass the situated and flexible nature of actual language use and to consider how peoples' accounts of cognitive processes and events are themselves parts of actions. For example, they reanalysed Ulric Neisser's classic work on the Watergate testimony showing the way John Dean's accounts of his excellent memory were used by counsel as parts of building the case against Richard Nixon. It was distinctive from the earlier discourse analytic approach to social psychology in its use of records of natural interaction rather than open ended interviews and its focus on sequential interaction rather than on the identification of interpretative repertoires. In 1996 he published the book Representing Reality. This was the fruition of a sustained engagement with the sociology of scientific knowledge and other approaches to factuality and provided an overview, extension and critique of social constructionism in social sciences. It developed a discursive version of constructionism in contrast to the more familiar social constructionisms of thinkers such as Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann. His collection Conversation and Cognition, co-edited with Hedwig te Molder, brought together a group of conversation analysts, ethnothodologists and discursive psychologists (including Geoff Coulter, John Heritage, Anita Pomerantz, and Robert Hopper) to address fundamental issues at the boundary of work on cognition and interaction. In 2007 he edited a three volume set of books that bring together a wide range of different studies in discursive psychology. Recent work Much of his recent work has been in collaboration with Alexa Hepburn. They developed a programme of study using material collected from the UK National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's child protection helpline. This has combined a theoretical interest in how ideas such as emotion and joint understanding are conceptualized in social psychological research with a focus on applied topics such as advice resistance and its management. Their paper on problems and prospects in the use of qualitative interviews in psychology, published in Qualitative Research in Psychology, generated debate with Jonathan Smith, Wendy Hollway and Elliot Mischler. It has been widely cited. This stimulated a further debate in Qualitative Research with Chris Griffin and Karen Henwood. New work is focused on studying video records of mealtime interaction in families with young children. This has looked at actions such as directives, requests and threats and has a broader concern about the contribution of interaction analysis to the study of obesity. In a 2010 paper in the British Journal of Social Psychology Potter summarised and continued the controversial debate over the status of discursive psychology with respect to both traditional social psychology and alternative styles of critical work.

While it tends to be dominated by poetry, especially the verse forms of the ghazal ÿ∫ÿ≤ŸÑ and nazm ŸÜÿ∏ŸÖ, it has expanded into other styles of writing, including that of the short story, or afsana ÿßŸÅÿ≥ÿßŸÜ€Å . Urdu literature is mostly popular in Pakistan, where Urdu is the national language and India, where it is a recognized language. It is also widely understood in Afghanistan and has moderate amount of popularity in Bangladesh. Origin Urdu developed in the Delhi Sultanate. Urdu literature originated some time around the 14th century in present-day North India among the sophisticated gentry of the courts. The continuing traditions of Islam and patronisations of foreign culture centuries earlier by Muslim rulers, usually of Turkic or Afghan descent, marked their influence on the Urdu language given that both cultural heritages were strongly present throughout Urdu territory. The Urdu language, with a vocabulary almost evenly split between Sanskrit-derived Prakrit and Arabo-Persian words, was a reflection of this cultural amalgamation. =Special contributors= Amir Khusro exercised great influence on the initial growth of not only Urdu literature, but the language itself (which only truly took shape as distinguished from both Persian and proto-Hindi around the 14th century). He is credited with the systematization of northern Indian classical music, including Hindustani music, and he wrote works both in Persian and Hindavi. While the couplets that come down from him are representative of a latter- Prakrit Hindi bereft of Arabo-Persian vocabulary, his influence on court viziers and writers must have been transcendental, for a century after his death Quli Qutub Shah was speaking a language that might be considered to be Urdu. Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah was a scholar in Persian and Arabic. He also wrote poetry in Telugu language, Persian language and Urdu language. His poetry has been compiled into Dewan or volume entitled \\"Kulliyat-e-Quli Qutub Shah.\\" Muhammed Quli Qutub Shah had the distinction of being the first Saheb- e-dewan Urdu poet and is credited with introducing a new sensibility into prevailing genres of Persian/Urdu poetry. It is said that the Urdu language acquired the status of a literary language due to his contributions. He died in the year 1611. Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri is considered as the first researcher of Deccaniyat. some of the works of Allama Hakeem Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri are Salateen e Muabber 1929, Urdu-i-qadim 1930, Tareekh E Maleebaar, Mowarrikheen E Hind, Tahfat al Mujahidin 1931, Imadiya, Nizam Ut Tawareekh, Tareekh Zuban Urdu-Urdu-E-Qadeem, Tareekh Zuban Urdu Al Musamma Ba Urdu-E- Qadeem, Tareekh Zuban Urdu Yaani Urdu-E-Qadeem, Tarikh Vol III, Asaarul Karaam, Tarikh Shijrah Asifiya, Ahleyaar, Pracina malabar  DƒÅstƒÅngoi (epics) ÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ ⁄ØŸàÿ¶€å  Urdu literature was generally composed more of poetry than of prose. The prose component of Urdu literature was mainly restricted to the ancient form of epic stories called dƒÅstƒÅn (). These long stories have complicated plots that deal with magical and otherwise fantastic creatures and events. The genre originated in the Middle East and was disseminated by folk storytellers. It was assimilated by individual authors. Dastan plots are based both on folklore and classical literary subjects. Dastan was particularly popular in Urdu literature, typologically close to other narrative genres in Eastern literatures, such as Persian masnawi, Punjabi qissa, Sindhi waqayati bait, etc., and also reminiscent of the European novel. The oldest known Urdu dastans are Dastan-i-Amir Hamza, recorded in the early seventeenth century, and the no longer extantBustan-i Khayal (The Garden of Imagination or The Garden of Khayal) by Mir Taqi Khayal (d. 1760). Most of the narrative dastans were recorded in the early nineteenth century, representing the inclusion of 'wandering' motifs borrowed from the folklore of the Middle East, central Asia and northern India. These include Bagh-o Bahar (The Garden and Spring) by Mir Amman, Mazhab-i-Ishq (The Religion of Love) by Nihalchand Lahori, Araish-i- Mahfil (The Adornment of the Assembly) by Hyderbakhsh Hyderi, and Gulzar-i- Chin (The Flower Bed of Chin) by Khalil Ali Khan Ashq. Other famous Urdu dastans include Nau tarz-i murassa‚Äò by Husain ‚ÄòAtƒÅ KhƒÅn Tahsƒ´n, Nau ƒÅ'ƒ´n-i hindƒ´ (Qissa-i Malik Mahm≈´d Gƒ´ti-Afroz) by Mihr Chand Khatrƒ´, Jazb-i ‚Äòishq by ShƒÅh Husain Haqƒ´qat, Nau tarz-i murassa‚Äò by Muhammad HƒÅdƒ´ (a.k.a. MirzƒÅ Mughal GhƒÅfil), and Talism Hoshruba by Muhammad Husain Azad.  (Tazkiras) (To Narrate) ÿ™ÿ∞⁄©€åÿ±€Å  Tazkiras, are compilations of literary memoirs that include verses and maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentaries on their styles. They are often a collection of names with a line or two of information about each poet, followed by specifics about his composition. Some of these tazkiras give biographical details, and a little idea of the style or poetical power is transmitted. Even the large anthologies do not systematically review an author's work. Most of them have the names in alphabetical order, but one or two are ordered by historical chronology. The majority quote only lyrics, and the quotations are usually chosen randomly.  Poetry ÿ¥ÿßÿπÿ±€å  Urdu poetry reached its peak in the 19th century. The most well-developed form of poetry is the ghazal, known for its quality and quantity within the Urdu tradition. =Sonnets= Urdu poets influenced by English and other European-language poetry began writing sonnets in Urdu in the early 20th century.Encyclopedic dictionary of Urdu literature p.565 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8182201918 Azmatullah Khan (1887-1923) is believed to have introduced this format to Urdu poetry.The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Five) p.4146 https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8126012218 Other renowned Urdu poets who wrote sonnets are Akhtar Junagarhi, Akhtar Sheerani, Noon Meem Rashid, Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi, Salaam Machhalishahari and Wazir Agha. Novels Initially, Urdu novels focused on urban social life, eventually widening in scope to include rural social life. They also covered the changing times under the progressive writing movement inspired by Sajjad Zaheer. However, the partition of India had a great impact on the novel, bringing up questions of identity and migration as can be seen in the major works of Abdullah Hussain and Quratul Ain Haider. Towards the end of the last century the novel took a serious turn towards the contemporary life and realities of the young generations of India. The most significant novels of the current generation of Indian novelists in Urdu, which demonstrate a new confidence in contemporary life, are Makaan by Paigham Afaqui, Do Gaz Zameen by Abdus Samad, and Pani by Ghazanfer. These works, especially Makaan, brought the Urdu novel out of the prevailing themes of partition and identity issues and took it into the realm of modern day realities and issues of life in India. Makaan had an impact on many English writers such as Vikram Seth, who turned to novel writing. These Urdu novels further impacted significant works such as Andhere Pag by Sarwat Khan, Numberdar Ka Neela by S M Ashraf and Fire Area by Ilyas Ahmed Gaddi. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, Paleeta, was published in 2011 and depicts the tension of the political sickening of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence. Bewildered by the disappointing state of democracy and the transformation of Indian society into a mental desert the central character dies after leaving behind his writings which catch fire. =Famous novels= *Mirat-al-Urus (The Bride's Mirror; 1868‚Äì1869) by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed is regarded as the first novel in Urdu. Within twenty years of publication over 100,000 copies had been printed; and was also translated into Bengali, Braj, Kashmiri, Punjabi, and Gujarati. It has never been out of print in Urdu. In 1903 an English translation was published in London by G. E. Ward. *Umrao-Jaan by Mirza Hadi Ruswa is also considered the first Urdu novel by many critics. *Binat-ul-Nash (The Daughters of the Bier, a name for the constellation Ursa Major) is another novel by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed. It was his 2nd novel after Mirat-tul-uroos. Like Mira-tul-Uroos, this novel is also on the education of women and their character building. *Zindagi (Everything Happens in Life; 1933‚Äì1934) by Chaudhry Afzal Haq describes the ups and downs of life for developing moral values and guidance of young people. His entire work is full of the teaching of moral values. *Taubat-un- Nasuh (Repentance of Nasuh; 1873‚Äì1874) by Deputy Nazeer Ahmed also focused on moral lessons for youth. *Fasaana-e-Mubtalaa (1885) was another novel for developing moral values and guidance for youth. *Jasoosi Dunya and Imran series by Ibn-e-Safi *\\"Aag Ka Darya\\" by Quratulain Haider *\\"Udas Naslain\\" by Abdullah Hussain *\\"Jangloos\\" by Shaukat Siddiqui *\\"Daira\\" (ÿØÿßÿ¶ÿ±€Å) by Muhammad Asim Butt *\\"Jannat Kay Pattay\\" by Nemrah Ahmed *\\"Pir-e-Kamil\\" by Umera Ahmad *\\"Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi \\" by Rahman Abbas *\\"Ek Mamnua Muhabbat Ki Kahani \\" by Rahman Abbas *\\"Rohzin \\" By Rahman Abbas In the first decade of twenty first century Rahman Abbas has emerged as most influential Urdu fiction writer. 'The Hindu', writes about work of Rahman Abbas, \\"With his uncanny ability to subvert what people believe, Rehman Abbas raises the art of story- telling to a new level.\\" =Short stories (afsanah nigari)= Urdu literature has included the short story form for slightly more than one hundred years. During this period it has passed through some major phases including the early romantic period, progressive writings, modernist writings, and the current phase. Although a number of male and female writers wrote short stories during the first phase G(including both romantic stories and social criticisms), the short story crystallized as a regular part of Urdu literature in the growth of the writings of Munshi Premchand. His notable short stories include \\"Kafan\\" and \\"Poos Ki Raat\\". The Urdu short story gained momentum with the phenomenal publication of Angare, a collection of many writers towards the end of the life of Premchand. Writers like Ghulam Abbas, Manto, Rajinder Singh Bedi, Krishan Chander and Ismat Chughtai, to name but a few, turned the short story into a major genre of Urdu literature. The next generation of Urdu short story writers included Qurratulain Hyder, Qazi Abdul Sattar and Joginder Paul. The short story tradition continues with younger generation writers like Zahida Hina, Paigham Afaqui, Syed Mohd Ashraf, Salam Bin Razzaq, Naeem Baig, Akhlaq Ahmed Khan and Moinuddin Jinabade. Urdu short stories have dealt with a wide range of the dimensions of life, but the most famous stories concern the trauma of the partition of the sub-continent and the violence generated out of it. Towards the end of the last century, short stories became grounded in the complexity of daily life which can be seen in the unique collection of short stories in Paigham Afaqui's Mafia. An entirely different approach is seen in the collection of short stories T'abir by Moinuddin Jinabade and Taus Chaman Ka Maina by Nayyer Masood. Drama Urdu drama evolved from the prevailing dramatic traditions of North India raas as practiced by exponents like Nawab Wajid Ali Shah of Awadh. His dramatic experiments led to the famous Inder Sabha of Amanat and later this tradition took the shape of Parsi Theatre. Agha Hashr Kashmiri is the culmination of this tradition. Urdu theater traditions have greatly influenced modern Indian theatre. Among all the languages, Urdu (which was called Hindi \\"meaning:Language of the Hind\\" by some early writers), along with Gujarati, Marathi, and Bengali theatres have remained popular. Many Urdu dramas have also been made into films. Classic playwrights include Prof Hasan, Ghulam Jeelani, J. N. Kaushal, Shameem Hanfi and Jameel Shaidayi. Danish Iqbal, Sayeed Alam, Shahid Anwar, Iqbal Niyazi and Anwar are a few of the post-modern playwrights actively contributing to Urdu drama. Sayeed Alam is known for his wit and humour in plays like Ghalib in New Delhi, Maulana Azad and Big B. Danish Iqbal's Dara Shikoh, directed by M S Sathyu, is considered a modern classic for its use of newer theatre techniques and a contemporary perspective. His other plays are Sahir, on the famous lyricist and revolutionary poet; Kuchh Ishq kiya Kuchh Kaam, a Celebration of the Faiz's poetry, featuring events from the early part of his life, particularly the events and incidents of pre-partition days which shaped his life and ideals; and Chand Roz Aur Meri Jaan, another play inspired from Faiz's letters written from various jails during the Rawalpindi Conspiracy days. He has written 14 other plays including Dilli Jo Ek Shehr Thaa and Main Gaya Waqt Nahin hoon. Shahid's Three B is also a significant play. He has been associated with many groups including 'Natwa'. Zaheer Anwar has kept the flag of Urdu Theatre flying in Kolkata. Unlike the writers of the previous generation, Sayeed, Shahid, Iqbal, and Zaheer do not write bookish plays but rather their work is a product of a vigorous performing tradition. Iqbal Niyazi of Mumbai has written several plays in Urdu. His play Aur Kitne Jalyanwala Baugh?? won several awards. Hence this is the only generation after Amanat and Agha Hashr who actually write for the stage and not for libraries. Literary movements =Progressive Writers Movement= According to The Dawn, the Progressive Writers Movement in Urdu literature was the strongest movement after Sir Syed's education movement. =Modernism= The modernist movement started in Urdu literature around 1960. This movement laid more stress on symbolic and other indirect expressions as opposed to direct and clear expressions. The most well-known names in this movement included Shamsur Rehman Farooqui and Gopichand Narang and the poets Noon Meem Rashid and Meeraji. Apart from them, a number of other poets like Zafer Iqbal, Nasir Kazmi, Bashir Bader and Shahryar are related to this movement. =Halqa e Arbab e Zauq= Halqa e Arbab e Zauq was a literary movement begun in Lahore, British Raj, India in 1939.Early members included poets Noon Meem Rashid, Zia Jallandhari, Muhtar Siddiqui, Hafeez Hoshiarpuri and Meeraji, brought to the meeting by his friend, Qayyum Nazar, an active member of the group. The Halqa was the second modern literary movement in Urdu poetry in the 20th century, founded just a couple of years after the leftist Progressive Writers' Movement, and is considered to be the most influential group on modern poetry in the Urdu Language. =Post-modernism= Post-modernism was introduced to Urdu literature by Gopi Chand Narang. Many other critics in Urdu literature are also attached to this approach to criticism. Post-modernism does not claim to be a movement and does not demand any writer to adopt a particular style of writing. It generally concentrates on a method of understanding contemporary literature in the light of its content‚Äîmostly examining features like feminism, Dalit, regional and other types of literature as opposed to seeking uniformity in the global literature on the basis of internationally established trends. =Independent writers= By the end of the 1980s the atmosphere in Urdu literature became very depressing. The progressive movement was almost dead and the modernist movement had started running out of ideas. But this was also the time for an upsurge of new creative forces rooted in the new life that was metamorphosing the socio-economic and political climate in the sub-continent. It was under this climate that a new era of fiction started with the publication of Paigham Afaqui's novel Makaan. Afaqui and other writers refused to be identified by any movement and displayed complete independence in using personally developed styles and techniques for writing novels and explored their own philosophy and vision of life. It was a serious departure from the theme of partition which dominated writers like Qurtul Ain haider and Abdullah Hussain and the theme of existentialism which was the benchmark of modernism. Writers like Ghazanfer and Musharraf Alam Zauqi have further widened the horizons of new themes and concerns. =Theatre of the Absurd= Theatre of the Absurd is a new and somewhat rare genre in the history of Urdu Literature. The first play of the genre was written and published by the Pakistan research-writer, poet, lawyer and columnist Mujtaba Haider Zaidi in December 2008 under the title Mazaron Ke PhoolIlm-o-Irfan Publishers, Urdu Bazaar, Lahore, Pakistan (i.e. Graveyard Flowers).

The objects of discourse analysis (discourse, writing, conversation, communicative event) are variously defined in terms of coherent sequences of sentences, propositions, speech, or turns-at-talk. Contrary to much of traditional linguistics, discourse analysts not only study language use 'beyond the sentence boundary' but also prefer to analyze 'naturally occurring' language use, not invented examples. Text linguistics is a closely related field. The essential difference between discourse analysis and text linguistics is that discourse analysis aims at revealing socio-psychological characteristics of a person/persons rather than text structure. Discourse analysis has been taken up in a variety of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences, including linguistics, education, sociology, anthropology, social work, cognitive psychology, social psychology, area studies, cultural studies, international relations, human geography, environmental science, communication studies, biblical studies, public relations and translation studies, each of which is subject to its own assumptions, dimensions of analysis, and methodologies. History =Early use of the term= The ancient Greeks (among others) had much to say on discourse; however, some scholars consider Austria-born Leo Spitzer's Stilstudien (Style Studies) of 1928 the earliest example of discourse analysis (DA). Michel Foucault translated it into French . However, the term first came into general use following the publication of a series of papers by Zellig Harris from 1952 reporting on work from which he developed transformational grammar in the late 1930s. Formal equivalence relations among the sentences of a coherent discourse are made explicit by using sentence transformations to put the text in a canonical form. Words and sentences with equivalent information then appear in the same column of an array. This work progressed over the next four decades (see references) into a science of sublanguage analysis (Kittredge & Lehrberger 1982), culminating in a demonstration of the informational structures in texts of a sublanguage of science, that of Immunology, (Harris et al. 1989) and a fully articulated theory of linguistic informational content (Harris 1991). During this time, however, most linguists ignored such developments in favor of a succession of elaborate theories of sentence-level syntax and semantics.John Corcoran, then a colleague of Harris in Linguistics at University of Pennsylvania, summarized and critically examined the development of Harris‚Äôs thought on discourse through 1969 in lectures attended by Harris‚Äô colleagues and students in Philadelphia and Cambridge. In January 1953, a linguist working for the American Bible Society, James A. Lauriault/Loriot, needed to find answers to some fundamental errors in translating Quechua, in the Cuzco area of Peru. Following Harris's 1952 publications, he worked over the meaning and placement of each word in a collection of Quechua legends with a native speaker of Quechua and was able to formulate discourse rules that transcended the simple sentence structure. He then applied the process to Shipibo, another language of Eastern Peru. He taught the theory at the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Norman, Oklahoma, in the summers of 1956 and 1957 and entered the University of Pennsylvania to study with Harris in the interim year. He tried to publish a paper Shipibo Paragraph Structure, but it was delayed until 1970 (Loriot & Hollenbach 1970). In the meantime, Kenneth Lee Pike, a professor at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, taught the theory, and one of his students, Robert E. Longacre developed it in his writings. Harris's methodology disclosing the correlation of form with meaning was developed into a system for the computer-aided analysis of natural language by a team led by Naomi Sager at NYU, which has been applied to a number of sublanguage domains, most notably to medical informatics. The software for the Medical Language Processor is publicly available on SourceForge. =In the humanities= In the late 1960s and 1970s, and without reference to this prior work, a variety of other approaches to a new cross-discipline of DA began to develop in most of the humanities and social sciences concurrently with, and related to, other disciplines, such as semiotics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and pragmatics. Many of these approaches, especially those influenced by the social sciences, favor a more dynamic study of oral talk-in-interaction. An example is \\"conversational analysis\\", which was influenced by the Sociologist Harold Garfinkel, the founder of Ethnomethodology. =Foucault= In Europe, Michel Foucault became one of the key theorists of the subject, especially of discourse, and wrote The Archaeology of Knowledge. In this context, the term 'discourse' no longer refers to formal linguistic aspects, but to institutionalized patterns of knowledge that become manifest in disciplinary structures and operate by the connection of knowledge and power. Since the 1970s, Foucault's works have had an increasing impact especially on discourse analysis in the social sciences. Thus, in modern European social sciences, one can find a wide range of different approaches working with Foucault's definition of discourse and his theoretical concepts. Apart from the original context in France, there is, at least since 2005, a broad discussion on socio-scientific discourse analysis in Germany. Here, for example, the sociologist Reiner Keller developed his widely recognized 'Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse (SKAD)'. Following the sociology of knowledge by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, Keller argues, that our sense of reality in everyday life and thus the meaning of every object, actions and events are the product of a permanent, routinized interaction. In this context, SKAD has been developed as a scientific perspective that is able to understand the processes of 'The Social Construction of Reality' on all levels of social life by combining Michel Foucault's theories of discourse and power with the theory of knowledge by Berger/Luckmann. Whereas the latter primarily focus on the constitution and stabilisation of knowledge on the level of interaction, Foucault's perspective concentrates on institutional contexts of the production and integration of knowledge, where the subject mainly appears to be determined by knowledge and power. Therefore, the 'Sociology of Knowledge Approach to Discourse' can also be seen as an approach to deal with the vividly discussed micro‚Äìmacro problem in sociology. Perspectives The following are some of the specific theoretical perspectives and analytical approaches used in linguistic discourse analysis: *Applied linguistics, an interdisciplinary perspective on linguistic analysis * Cognitive neuroscience of discourse comprehension *Cognitive psychology, studying the production and comprehension of discourse. *Conversation analysis *Critical discourse analysis *Discursive psychology *Emergent grammar *Ethnography of communication *Functional grammar *Interactional sociolinguistics *Mediated Stylistics *Pragmatics *Response based therapy (counselling) *Rhetoric *Stylistics (linguistics) *Sublanguage analysis *Tagmemics *Text linguistics *Variation analysis Although these approaches emphasize different aspects of language use, they all view language as social interaction and are concerned with the social contexts in which discourse is embedded. Often a distinction is made between 'local' structures of discourse (such as relations among sentences, propositions, and turns) and 'global' structures, such as overall topics and the schematic organization of discourses and conversations. For instance, many types of discourse begin with some kind of global 'summary', in titles, headlines, leads, abstracts, and so on. A problem for the discourse analyst is to decide when a particular feature is relevant to the specification required. A question many linguists ask is: \\"Are there general principles which will determine the relevance or nature of the specification?\\" Topics of interest Topics of discourse analysis include: * The various levels or dimensions of discourse, such as sounds (intonation, etc.), gestures, syntax, the lexicon, style, rhetoric, meanings, speech acts, moves, strategies, turns, and other aspects of interaction *Genres of discourse (various types of discourse in politics, the media, education, science, business, etc.) *The relations between discourse and the emergence of syntactic structure *The relations between text (discourse) and context *The relations between discourse and power *The relations between discourse and interaction *The relations between discourse and cognition and memory  Prominent academics  * Jan Blommaert * Teun van Dijk * Michel Foucault * Heidi E. Hamilton * Barbara Johnstone * Sinfree Makoni * Jonathan Potter * Deborah Schiffrin * Deborah Tannen * Margaret Wetherell * Ruth Wodak =Political discourse= Political discourse analysis is a field of discourse analysis which focuses on discourse in political forums (such as debates, speeches, and hearings) as the phenomenon of interest. Policy analysis requires discourse analysis to be effective from the post-positivist perspective.. Political discourse is the formal exchange of reasoned views as to which of several alternative courses of action should be taken to solve a societal problem. = Corporate discourse = Corporate discourse can be broadly defined as the language used by corporations. It encompasses a set of messages that a corporation sends out to the world (the general public, the customers and other corporations) and the messages it uses to communicate within its own structures (the employees and other stakeholders).

It was designed and operated by Michael J. Freedman. Coral used the bandwidth of a worldwide network of web proxies and name servers to mirror World Wide Web content, often to avoid the Slashdot Effect or to reduce the load on web servers.  Operation  Coral avoided high loads on individual nodes through an indexing abstraction called a distributed sloppy hash table (DSHT); DSHTs create self-organizing clusters of nodes which fetch information from each other to avoid communicating with more distant or heavily-loaded servers. DSHT is described in the paper Sloppy hashing and self-organizing clusters. The sloppy hash table refers to the fact that Coral was made up of concentric rings of distributed hash tables (DHTs), each ring representing a wider and wider geographic range (or rather, ping range). The DHTs are composed of nodes all within some latency of each other (for example, a ring of nodes within 20 milliseconds of each other). It avoids hot spots (the 'sloppy' part) by only continuing to query progressively larger sized rings if they are not overburdened. In other words, if the two top-most rings are experiencing too much traffic, a node will just ping closer ones: when a node that is overloaded is reached, upward progression stops. This minimises the occurrence of hot spots, with the disadvantage that knowledge of the system as a whole is reduced.  Usage  Coral users could access content through the Coral Cache by adding \`.nyud.net\` to the hostname in the site's URL, resulting in what is known as a 'coralized link'. So, for example, :\`http://example.com\` becomes :\`http://example.com.nyud.net\` Any additional address component after the hostname remains after \`.nyud.net\`; hence :\`http://example.com/folder/page.html\` becomes :\`http://example.com.nyud.net/folder/page.html\` For websites that use a non- standard port, for example, :\`http://example.com:8080\` becomes :\`http://example.com.nyud.net:8080\`  History  The project was deployed in March 2004, during which it has been hosted on PlanetLab, a large-scale distributed research network of several hundred servers deployed at universities worldwide.

As a regional style, its original form was characterized by jazz and swing influences. Later examples are often closer to blues rock and Southern rock. History Stevie Ray Vaughan was the most prominent figure in one style of Texas electric blues in the late 20th century Texas blues began to appear in the early 1900s among African Americans who worked in oilfields, ranches and lumber camps. In the 1920s, Blind Lemon Jefferson innovated the style by using jazz-like improvisation and single string accompaniment on a guitar; Jefferson's influence defined the field and inspired later performers. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, many bluesmen moved to cities including Galveston, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas. It was from these urban centers that a new wave of popular performers appeared, including slide guitarist and gospel singer Blind Willie Johnson. Future bluesmen, such as, Lightnin' Hopkins, Lil' Son Jackson, and T-Bone Walker were influenced by these developments. Robert Johnson's two recording sessions both took place in Texas, although he was from Mississippi. T-Bone Walker relocated to Los Angeles to record his most influential work in the 1940s. His swing-influenced backing and lead guitar sound became an influential part of the electric blues. It was T-Bone Walker, B.B. King once said, who ‚Äúreally started me to want to play the blues. I can still hear T-Bone in my mind today, from that first record I heard, ‚ÄòStormy Monday.‚Äô He was the first electric guitar player I heard on record. He made me so that I knew I just had to go out and get an electric guitar.‚Äù He also influenced Goree Carter, whose \\"Rock Awhile\\" (1949) featured an over-driven electric guitar style and has been cited as a strong contender for the \\"first rock and roll record\\" title.Robert Palmer, Church of the Sonic Guitar, pp. 13‚Äì38 in Anthony DeCurtis, Present Tense, Duke University Press, 1992, p. 19. . The state's R&B; recording industry was based in Houston with labels such as Duke/Peacock, which in the 1950s provided a base for artists who would later pursue the electric Texas blues sound, including Johnny Copeland and Albert Collins. Freddie King, a major influence on electric blues, was born in Texas, but moved to Chicago as a teenager. His instrumental number \\"Hide Away\\" (1961), was emulated by British blues artists including Eric Clapton.M. Roberty and C. Charlesworth, The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton (Omnibus Press, 1995), p. 11. In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Texas electric blues scene began to flourish, influenced by country music and blues rock, particularly in the clubs of Austin. The diverse style often featured instruments such as keyboards and horns with emphasis on guitar soloing.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to the blues: the definitive guide to the blues (Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2003), pp. 694‚Äì5. The most prominent artists to emerge in this era were the brothers Johnny and Edgar Winter, who combined traditional and southern styles. In the 1970s, Jimmie Vaughan formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds and in the 1980s his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan broke through to mainstream success with his virtuoso guitar playing, as did ZZ Top with their brand of Southern rock.E.

Distributed Cognition: an alternative framework for analysing and explaining collaborative working. Published in Journal of Information Technology, 1994, vol 9(2), 119-128. \\"DCog\\" is a specific approach to distributed cognition (distinct from other meanings) which takes a computational perspective towards goal-based activity systems.. Using insights from sociology, cognitive science, and the psychology of Vygotsky (cf. cultural-historical psychology) it emphasizes the ways that cognition is off-loaded into the environment through social and technological means. It is a framework for studying cognition rather than a type of cognition. This framework involves the coordination between individuals, artifacts and the environment. According to Zhang & Norman (1994), the distributed cognition approach has three key components: # Embodiment of information that is embedded in representations of interaction # Coordination of enaction among embodied agents # Ecological contributions to a cognitive ecosystem DCog studies the \\"propagation of representational states across media\\" (Rogers and Ellis, ibid.). Mental content is considered to be non- reducible to individual cognition and is more properly understood as off- loaded and extended into the environment, where information is also made available to other agents (Heylighen, Heath, & Overwalle, 2003). It is often understood as an approach in specific opposition to earlier and still prevalent \\"brain in a vat\\" models which ignore \\"situatedness, embodiment and enaction\\" as key to any cognitive act (Ibid.). These representation-based frameworks consider distributed cognition as \\"a cognitive system whose structures and processes are distributed between internal and external representations, across a group of individuals, and across space and time\\" (Zhang and Patel, 2006). In general terms, they consider a distributed cognition system to have two components: internal and external representations. In their description, internal representations are knowledge and structure in individuals' minds while external representations are knowledge and structure in the external environment (Zhang, 1997b; Zhang and Norman, 1994). DCog studies the ways that memories, facts, or knowledge is embedded in the objects, individuals, and tools in our environment. DCog is a useful approach for designing the technologically mediated social aspects of cognition by putting emphasis on the individual and his/her environment, and the media channels with which people interact, either in order to communicate with each other, or socially coordinate to perform complex tasks. Distributed cognition views a system of cognition as a set of representations propagated through specific media, and models the interchange of information between these representational media. These representations can be either in the mental space of the participants or external representations available in the environment. These interactions can be categorized into three distinct types of processes: # Cognitive processes may be distributed across the members of a social group. # Cognitive processes may be distributed in the sense that the operation of the cognitive system involves coordination between internal and external (material or environmental) structure. # Processes may be distributed through time in such a way that the products of earlier events can transform the nature of related events. Early research John Milton Roberts thought that social organization could be seen as cognition through a community . He described the cognitive aspects of a society by looking at the present information and how it moves through the people in the society. Daniel L. Schwartz (1978) proposed a distribution of cognition through culture and the distribution of beliefs across the members of a society. In 1998, Mark Perry from Brunel University London explored the problems and the benefits brought by distributed cognition to \\"understanding the organisation of information within its contexts.\\" He considered that distributed cognition draws from the information processing metaphor of cognitive science where a system is considered in terms of its inputs and outputs and tasks are decomposed into a problem space (Perry, 1998). He believed that information should be studied through the representation within the media or artifact that represents the information. Cognition is said to be \\"socially distributed\\" when it is applied to demonstrate how interpersonal processes can be used to coordinate activity within a social group. In 1999, Gavriel Salomon stated that there were two classes of distributive cognition: shared cognition and off-loading. Shared cognition is that which is shared among people through common activity such as conversation where there is a constant change of cognition based on the other person's responses. An example of off-loading would be using a calculator to do arithmetic or a creating a grocery list when going shopping. In that sense, the cognitive duties are off-loaded to a material object. Later, John Sutton (2006) defined five appropriate domains of investigation for research in Dcog: # External cultural tools, artifacts, and symbol systems. # Natural environmental resources. # Interpersonal and social distribution or scaffolding. # Embodied capacities and skills. # Internalized cognitive artifacts. Applications The application area of DCog is systems design and implementation in specific work environments. Its main method is field research, going into the workplace and making rigorous observations, e.g. through capturing work performances with video, studying and coding the recorded activities using qualitative research methods to codify the various ways in which cognition is distributed in the local environment, through the social and technical systems with which the workers engage. Distributed cognition as a theory of learning, i.e. one in which the development of knowledge is attributed to the system of thinking agents interacting dynamically with artifacts, has been widely applied in the field of distance learning, especially in relation to computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) and other computer-supported learning tools. For example, in the field of teaching English Composition, Kevin LaGrandeur has argued that CSCL provides a source of common memory, collaborative space, and a cognitive artifact (tool to enhance cognition) that allows students to more easily build effective written compositions via explicit and implicit machine-human collaboration. Distributed cognition illustrates the process of interaction between people and technologies in order to determine how to best represent, store and provide access to digital resources and other artifacts. Collaborative tagging on the World Wide Web is one of the most recent developments in technological support for distributed cognition. Beginning in 2004Mika,Peter.(2005) \\"Ontologies are us: A united model of social networks and semantics\\" Referenced 20 March 2014 and quickly becoming a standard on websites, collaborative tagging allows users to upload or select materials (e.g. pictures, music files, texts, websites) and associate tags with these materials. Tags can be chosen freely, and are similar to keywords. Other users can then browse through tags; a click on a tag connects a user to similarly tagged materials. Tags furthermore enable tag clouds, which graphically represent the popularity of tags, demonstrating co-occurrence relations between tags and thus jump from one tag to another. Dcog has also been used to understand learning and communication in clinical settings and to obtain an integrated view of clinical workplace learning. It has been observed how medical actors use and connect gestural practices, along with visual and haptic structures of their own bodies and of artifacts such as technological instruments and computational devices. In so doing they co-construct complex, multimodal representations that go beyond the mental representations usually studied from a cognitive perspective of learning (Pimmer, Pachler & Genewein, 2013).Pimmer, C., Pachler, N., & Genewein, U. (2013) \\"Reframing Clinical Workplace Learning Using the Theory of Distributed Cognition\\". Academic Medicine, 88(9), 1239‚Äì1245. Distributed cognition can also be seen through cultures and communities. Learning certain habits or following certain traditions is seen as cognition distributed over a group of people. Exploring distributed cognition through community and culture is one way to understand how it may work. With the new research that is emerging in this field, the overarching concept of distributed cognition enhances the understanding of interactions between individual human beings and artifacts such as technologies and machines, and complex external environments. This concept has been applied to educational research in the areas of distributed leadership and distributed instruction. Metaphors and examples Distributed cognition is seen when using paper and pencil to do a complicated arithmetic problem. The person doing the problem may talk with a friend to clarify the problem, and then must write the partial answers on the paper in order to be able to keep track of all the steps in the calculation. In this example, the parts of distributed cognition are seen in: * setting up the problem, in collaboration with another person, * performing manipulation/arithmetic procedures, both in one's head and by writing down resulting partial answers. The process of working out the answer requires not only the perception and thought of two people, it also requires the use of a tool (paper) to extend an individual's memory. So the intelligence is distributed, both between people, and a person and an object. Another well-researched site for analyzing distributed cognition and applying the discovered insights towards the design of more optimal systems is aviation, where both cockpits and air traffic control environments have been studied as scenes that technologically and socially distribute cognition through systems of externalized representational media. It is not the cognitive performance and expertise of any one single person or machine that is important for the continued operation or the landing and takeoff of airplanes. The cognition is distributed over the personnel, sensors, and machinery both in the plane and on the ground, including but not limited to the controllers, pilots and crew as a whole.Hutchins, E. (1995). How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds. Cognitive Science, 19(3), 265-288. Hutchins also examined another scene of distributed cognition within the context of navigating a US navy vessel.Caroll, J. M., (2003). HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks: Toward a Multidisciplinary Science. Morgan Kaufmann. In his book on USS Palau,Hutchins, E. (1995). Cognition in the wild. Bradford: MIT Press. he explains in detail how distributed cognition is manifested through the interaction between crew members as they interpret, process, and transform information into various representational states in order to safely navigate the ship. In this functional unit, crew members (e.g. pelorus operators, bearing takers, plotters, and the ship's captain) play the role of actors who transform information into different representational states (i.e. triangulation, landmark sightings, bearings, and maps). In this context, navigation is embodied through the combined efforts of actors in the functional unit. In his study on process, representation and taskworld, Mark Perry (1998) demonstrated how distributed cognition analysis can be conducted in a field study. His example was design analysis in Civil engineering. In this work, he showed how an information processing approach can be applied by carrying a detailed analysis of the background of the study - goals and resources, inputs and outputs, representations and processes, and transformational activity, \\"how information was transformed from the design drawings and site onto tables of measurements (different representations)\\" and then onto \\"a graphical representation\\" which provided a clearer demonstration of the relationship between the two data sets (Perry, 1998).

Air Force and Army Aviator Badges are issued in three ratings: Basic, Senior, and Command (Air Force)/Master (Army). The higher degrees are denoted by a star or star with wreath above the badge. Air Force regulations state that the basic rating denotes completion of specified training and that the advanced ratings denote experience levels. The Naval Aviator Badge is issued in a single rating for Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard aviators. United States Air Force =World War I= The first United States Aviator Badges were issued to members of the Air Service during World War I. The badges were issued in three degrees: Observer (a \\"US\\" shield and one left-side wing), Junior Aviator or Reserve Aviation Officer (a \\"US\\" shield between two wings), and Senior Aviator (a star over \\"US\\" shield between two wings). The Army Air Service also issued a badge for balloon pilots, known as the Aeronaut Badge. Enlisted Aviators wore their regular rank insignia and the Observer's badge. There were 29 enlisted pilots before the American entry into World War I. The second enlisted aviator, William A. Lamkey, got a discharge and flew for Pancho Villa. The remaining enlisted pilots received commissions in 1917. There were 60 enlisted mechanics who were trained as pilots in France during the war, but they were used for ferrying duties and did not fly in combat.https://web.archive.org/web/20070707111442/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1427 The recruiting and training of enlisted Aviators ended in 1933. =World War II= Command Pilot Badge, World War II U.S. Army Air Forces design and current U.S. Air Force regulation insignia. Senior Pilot Badge, World War II U.S. Army Air Forces and U.S. Air Force sample image. During World War II, with the rise of the Army Air Forces, a second series of aviator badges were issued to include a design that has survived to the modern day. The Pilot Badge was issued in three degrees, including Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Command Pilot. A polished silver colored version of these badges is currently used as the United States Air Force Pilot Badges. From August 1941 to November 1942, the Enlisted Aviator program was restarted. Candidates had to be at least 18, possess a high school diploma, and have graduated at the top of their high school class. Graduates were rated as Flight Staff Sergeants or Flight Technical Sergeants and wore the same pilot's wings as officers. They were usually assigned to pilots of transport and auxiliary aircraft to free officer pilots to pilot the more prestigious fighters and bombers. Auxiliary pilots received their own special wings to indicate their status and specialty. In November 1942 all enlisted pilots were promoted to Flight Officer rank and enlisted cadets were graded as Flight Officers or Second Lieutenants depending on merit. The qualifying requirements for the Senior Pilot Wings are: Seven (7) years as rated pilot and permanent award of pilot rating. Plus 2000 total hours or 1300 hours primary and instructor flight (refer to U.S. Air Force aeronautical rating for details). =Independent Air Force= In 1947, the U.S. Army Air Forces became its own separate service as the U.S. Air Force. The Air Force use the same pilot's badges as the earlier USAAF design, except that starting in the mid-1990s, they began to be made of chrome metal or sterling silver rather than the dull alloy wings used by the Army Air Forces and Air Force from 1947 to the mid-1990s. The U.S. Air Force currently issues several aviation badges including pilot, combat systems officer (formerly navigator), air battle manager, flight surgeon, flight nurse, non-rated officer aircrew, and enlisted aircrew. The requirements to earn these are listed here. United States Army After the creation of the U.S. Air Force as a separate service in 1947, Army Aviation continued to a degree that warranted a new badge for Army Aviators. The result was the creation of the Army Aviator Badge, which is a modified version of the U.S. Air Force Pilot Badge. It comes in three grades: Basic, Senior (7 years service and 1,000 flight hours), and Master (15 years service and 2,000 flight hours). The Aviator and Senior Aviator Badges were approved on 27 July 1950 and the Master Aviator Badge was approved on 12 February 1957. United States Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard The aviator badge currently used in the Navy has remained virtually unchanged since it was first issued on 13 November 1917. The Naval Aviator Badge is earned by all U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard pilots upon graduation from advanced flight training. Additional aviator badges exist for Naval Flight Officers (USN & USMC), Naval Flight Surgeons, Naval Aviation Physiologists, Naval Flight Nurses, Naval Aviation Observers (USN & USMC) and enlisted Naval Aircrewman (USN, USMC & USCG). Naval Aviators' badges are gold in color. Unlike the Air Force and the Army, the naval services do not employ senior or command/master aeronautical ratings. NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps NOAA Aviator insignia The NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps Aviator Insignia is a gold-colored pin, winged, with a central device consisting of a fouled anchor surcharged with a NOAA Corps device. NOAA Corps officer pilots and navigators may wear the NOAA aviator insignia after authorization by the Director of the NOAA Corps. NASA With the dawn of the Space Age, all of the United States Aviator badges are upgradable to the Astronaut Badge, for those military members who become astronauts.

Hutchins is one of the main developers of distributed cognition. Hutchins was a student of the cognitive anthropologist Roy D'Andrade and has been a strong advocate of the use of anthropological methods in cognitive science. He is considered the father of modern cognitive ethnography. His early work involved studies of logic in legal discourse among people of the Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea. For a time he worked in the Navy doing research on how crews of ship can function as a distributed machine, offloading the cognitive burden of ship navigation onto each member of the crew. He was a recipient of the prestigious MacArthur \\"Genius Grant\\". In 1995, Hutchins published Cognition in the Wild, a detailed study of distributed cognitive processes in a navy ship (an Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault shipAlthough Hutchins does not mention the ship class by name, he characterizes it as a amphibious helicopter carrier (Cognition in the Wild, p. 7).); like other works related to distributed cognition, it criticizes disembodied views of cognition and proposes an alternative which looks at cognitive systems that may be composed of multiple agents and the material world. Other areas of his work include the study of airline cockpitsHutchins, E. (1995). How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds. Cognitive Science, 19(3), 265-288., the development of cognitive ethnographic methods and tools, and human-computer interaction. He ran the Distributed Cognition and Human Computer Interaction Laboratory at UC San Diego, in collaboration with James Hollan until 2014. He is now professor emeritus in the UC San Diego Department of Cognitive Science.

These include middle ear infections, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease. It is also sometimes used before surgery and following a bite wound to try to prevent infection. Ceftriaxone can be given by injection into a vein or into a muscle. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and allergic reactions. Other possible side effects include C. difficile associated diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, gall bladder disease, and seizures. It is not recommended in those who have had anaphylaxis to penicillin but may be used in those who have had milder reactions. The intravenous form should not be given with intravenous calcium. There is tentative evidence that ceftriaxone is relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is a third-generation cephalosporin that works by preventing bacteria from making a cell wall. Ceftriaxone was patented in 1978, and approved for medical use in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.  Medical use  A vial of ceftriaxone, manufactured and sold in Russia Ceftriaxone and other third-generation antibiotics are used to treat organisms that tend to be resistant to many other antibiotics. Due to emergent resistance, ceftriaxone should not be used for the treatment of Enterobacter infections. Before using ceftriaxone, it is important to determine the susceptibility of the bacteria. If sepsis is being considered, empiric therapy may be initiated prior to susceptibility testing. Medical uses include: * lower respiratory tract infections * acute bacterial otitis media * skin and skin structure infections * urinary tract infections * uncomplicated gonorrhea * pelvic inflammatory disease * bacterial sepsis * intra-abdominal infections * meningitis * surgical prophylaxis * Lyme disease Ceftriaxone is also a choice drug for treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by pneumococci, meningococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and \\"susceptible enteric Gram-negative rods, but not Listeria monocytogenes.\\" In combination with doxycycline or azithromycin, ceftriaxone is recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the treatment of gonorrhea. By itself, it is not recommended due to the potential for resistance development. = Spectrum of activity = Like other third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone is active against Citrobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and beta- lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus and Neisseria. However, unlike ceftazidime and cefoperazone, ceftriaxone does not have useful activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is generally not active against Enterobacter species, and its use should be avoided in the treatment of Enterobacter infections, even if the isolate appears susceptible, because of the emergence of resistance. Some organisms, such as Citrobacter, Providencia, and Serratia, have the ability to become resistant through the development of cephalosporinases (these enzymes hydrolyze cephalosporins and render them inactive). = Available forms = Ceftriaxone is available for administration via the intramuscular or the intravenous routes. Diluents containing calcium should not be used to reconstitute ceftriaxone and it must not be administered in intravenous lines containing other calcium-containing solutions, as a ceftriaxone-calcium precipitate could form. = Specific populations = Pregnancy Ceftriaxone is pregnancy category B. It has not been observed to cause birth defects in animal studies, but a lack of well- controlled studies done in pregnant women exists. Breastfeeding Low concentrations of ceftriaxone are excreted in breast milk that are \\"not expected to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants.\\" The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering ceftriaxone to women who breastfeed.  Newborns  Hyperbilirubinemic neonates are contraindicated for the use of ceftriaxone. It can compete with bilirubin and displace it from binding to albumin, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.  Elderly  According to the package insert, clinical studies did not show differences in efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone in geriatrics compared to younger patients but \\"greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.\\"  Adverse effects  Although generally well tolerated, the most common adverse reactions associated with ceftriaxone are changes in white blood cell counts, local reactions at site of administration, rash, and diarrhea. Incidence of adverse effects greater than 1%: * Eosinophilia (6%) * Thrombocytosis (5.1%) * Elevations in liver enzymes (3.1‚Äì3.3%) * Diarrhea (2.7%) * Leukopenia (2.1%) * Elevation in BUN (1.2%) * Local reactions‚Äîpain, tenderness, irritation (1%) * Rash (1.7%) Some less frequently reported adverse events (incidence < 1%) include phlebitis, itchiness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, elevations of bilirubin, elevations in creatinine, headache and dizziness. Ceftriaxone may precipitate in bile, causing biliary sludge, biliary pseudolithiasis, and gallstones, especially in children. Hypoprothrombinaemia and bleeding are specific side effects. Haemolysis is reported. It has also been reported to cause post kidney failure in children. Like other antibiotics, ceftriaxone use can result in Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. =Contraindications= Ceftriaxone should not be used in those with an allergy to ceftriaxone or any component of the formulation. Although there is negligible cross-reactivity between penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins, caution should still be used when using ceftriaxone in penicillin-sensitive patients. Caution should be used in people who have had previous severe penicillin allergies. It should not be used in hyperbilirubinemic neonates, particularly those who are premature because ceftriaxone is reported to displace bilirubin from albumin binding sites, potentially causing bilirubin encephalopathy. Concomitant use with intravenous calcium-containing solutions/products in neonates (‚â§28 days) is contraindicated even if administered through different infusion lines due to rare fatal cases of calcium-ceftriaxone precipitations in neonatal lungs and kidneys. Mechanism of action Ceftriaxone is a third-generation antibiotic from the cephalosporin family of antibiotics. It is within the Œ≤-lactam family of antibiotics. Ceftriaxone selectively and irreversibly inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to transpeptidases, also called transamidases, which are penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that catalyze the cross-linking of the peptidoglycan polymers forming the bacterial cell wall. The peptidoglycan cell wall is made up of pentapeptide units attached to a polysaccharide backbone with alternating units of N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid. PBPs act on a terminal D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety on a pentapeptide unit and catalyze the formation of a peptide bond between the penultimate D-alanine and a glycine unit on an adjacent peptidoglycan strand, releasing the terminal D-alanine unit in the process. The structure of ceftriaxone mimics the D-alanyl-D-alanine moiety, and the PBP attacks the beta-lactam ring in ceftriaxone as if it were its normal D-alanyl-D-alanine substrate. The peptidoglycan cross-linking activity of PBPs is a construction and repair mechanism that normally helps to maintain bacterial cell wall integrity, so the inhibition of PBPs leads to damage and destruction of the cell wall and eventually to cell lysis.  Pharmacokinetics Absorption: Ceftriaxone can be administered intravenously and intramuscularly, and the drug is completely absorbed. It is not available orally. Distribution: Ceftriaxone penetrates tissues and body fluids well, including cerebrospinal fluid to treat central nervous system infections. The average volume of distribution in adults is 5.8‚Äì13.5 liters. Metabolism: 33‚Äì67% of ceftriaxone is renally excreted as unchanged drug, but no dose adjustments are required in renal impairment with dosages up to 2 grams per day. The rest is excreted in the bile as inactive compounds from hepatic and gut flora metabolism. Elimination: The average elimination half-life in healthy adults is 5.8‚Äì8.7 hours. In people with renal impairment, the average elimination half-life increases to 11.4‚Äì15.7 hours.  Chemistry  Ceftriaxone is commercially available as a white to yellowish-orange crystalline powder for reconstitution. Reconstituted ceftriaxone injection solutions are light yellow- to amber-colored depending on how long the solution had been reconstituted, the concentration of ceftriaxone in the solution, and the diluent used. To reduce pain with intramuscular injections, ceftriaxone may be reconstituted with lidocaine. The syn-configuration of the methoxyoxime moiety confers resistance to beta-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The stability of this configuration results in increased activity of ceftriaxone against otherwise resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In place of the easily hydrolyzed acetyl group of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone has a metabolically stable thiotriazinedione moiety. Research  Ceftriaxone has also been investigated for efficacy in preventing relapse to cocaine addiction. Ceftriaxone seems to increase excitatory amino acid transporter-2 pump expression and activity in the central nervous system, so has a potential to reduce glutamatergic toxicity. Ceftriaxone has been shown to have neuroprotective properties in a number of neurological disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite earlier negative results in the 1990s, a large clinical trial was undertaken in 2006 to test ceftriaxone in ALS patients, but was stopped early after it became clear that the results would not meet the predetermined criteria for efficacy.

Early life Fitzwilliam has one sister. She grew up in Jade Gardens Diamond Vale, Diego Martin and attended Diego Martin Girls R.C before attending St. Joseph's Convent in Port of Spain, she also studied Law. Miss Universe Fitzwilliam modeled for local fashion designer Meiling in her teenage and early years. She won Miss Trinidad and Tobago. At age 25, she participated in the 1998 Miss Universe pageant held at the Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. She beat off challenges from the other semifinalists: Top 10 semifinalists Anna Malova of Russia, Andrea Roche of Ireland, Kerishnie Naicker of South Africa, Lymaraina D'Souza of India and Michella Marchi of Brazil, Top 5 finalists Silvia Ortiz of Colombia and Shawnae Jebbia of USA, eventual 2nd Runner-Up Joyce Giraud of Puerto Rico, and eventual 1st Runner-Up Veruska Ram√≠rez of Venezuela. Fitzwilliam's regal air and perfect evening gown presentation won her the favor of the judges and made her the favorite to capture the crown that night. However, once the final 3 were announced, the final answer portion led people to suspense, since there was a deadlock between her and Ramirez of Venezuela who had won the swimsuit competition with the highest score ever seen at the time. Because there were eight members on the panel of judges and no way to break an eventual tie, the decision promised to be a nail-biter. In the end, Fitzwilliam prevailed and became the first contestant in history to win wearing a bikini in the swimsuit competition, denying Ram√≠rez that title as well. Her win came 21 years after another Trinidadian, Janelle Commissiong, who also happened to be the first Miss Universe of African heritage, captured in 1977 the crown for her country for the first time. Fitzwilliam is, thus, the second titleholder from Trinidad & Tobago and the third of African heritage, after Commissiong and biracial Chelsi Smith of the United States. During her reign, she was honored by the United Nations and bestowed the title of UNAIDS and UNFPA Goodwill Ambassador for her work in HIV/AIDS education and awareness. Her dedication to the HIV/AIDS cause also led her to found The Hibiscus Foundation (THF) in Trinidad & Tobago on 6 September 1998. This organization was established to heighten AIDS awareness in Trinidad & Tobago and to give assistance, financially and otherwise, to children‚Äôs homes in Trinidad. She was the international spokesperson for Clear Essence Skin Care and made several notable television appearances having hosted segments of \\"Wild On‚Ä¶\\" for E! Entertainment Television and the Miss Universe Special for the same network. She made appearances on \\"Live with Regis and Kathy Lee\\", \\"The Magic Hour\\", \\"Politically Incorrect\\", \\"The O‚ÄôReilly Factor\\", CNN‚Äôs \\"Talk Back Live\\", Trinidad & Tobago Carnival\\" for BET, \\"The Johnny Cockran Show\\" on Court TV, Soca Monarch Finals for CNMG with Danny Glover and Chris Tucker, among others. After Miss Universe After her reign, she recorded a jazz demo and continued her education. In 2000, she was admitted into the bar. Fitzwilliam has also acted as a judge and host for many regional and international pageants, such as Miss Guyana, Miss Trinidad & Tobago and Miss Universe. She was the Vice President of Investment Promotion at the Evolving TecKnologies and Enterprise Development Company Limited (E TecK), a state-owned company in Trinidad & Tobago. She is also attached to the Trinidad Guardian's Guardian in Education: Making a Difference project, a series of motivational school tours that also features former World Champion sprinter Ato Boldon and cyclist Michael Phillips, aiming to promote the development of the country's diversity.

Its population of 83,303Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica, Spanish National Statistics Institute. makes it the second most populated municipality of the province of Toledo and the fourth largest in the region. Although the city straddles both banks of the Tagus, few kilometres downstream from the junction of the former with the Alberche, most of the urbanisation concentrates on the right (northern) bank. There are two islands in the center of the city called Isla Grande and Chamelo Island. Three bridges cross the Tagus in Talavera. The city is well known by its pottery craft. The Talavera de la Reina pottery was declared intangible cultural heritage by the UNESCO in 2019. Toponymy There are remnants of prehistoric cultures in the area. The village was founded by the Celts as a ford of the Tagus. The first mention of the city (with the name Aebura) occurs in Livy's description of a battle between the Romans and the Carpetanoi, a Celtiberian tribe. After the Roman conquest of Hispania, it was known as Caesarobriga, one of many Celtic toponyms preserved in Roman Hispania, with a name connoting \\"fortified\\" that was extended to many non-fortified towns: \\"Caesarburg\\".Juan Luis Garc√≠a Alonso, \\"-Briga Toponyms in the Iberian Peninsula,\\" e-Keltoi 6 Caesarobriga served as an important center for agriculture and ceramics in the 3rd and 4th centuries BCE During the Visigothic period, Talavera reverted to a variant of its Celtiberian name: Elbora or Ebora. Its modern name is derived from Talabayra, the Muslim rendering of this Visigothic name. The city was conquered by Muslim forces in 713 and conquered by Christian forces under Alfonso VI of Castile in 1083. History = Foundation= Talavera de la Reina was founded at the confluence of the rivers Alberche and Tagus. This area of great ecological wealth was the settlement of Celtic people who built the most ancient ruins of the area. =Roman Empire and Visigothic Age= During the time of the Roman Empire the name of the city was Caesarobriga. In 182 BCE Quintus Fulvius Flaccus conquered the city, establishing it as part of the Roman province of Lusitania as a city that would pay a stipend, and as the capital of an extended area included in the legal convent of the city of Emerita Augusta. The leader Viriato, in his war against the Romans, lived in this territory between 145 and 139 BCE. In this period Talavera de la Reina was a rich city with cattle markets and commercial exchange. Christianity came early to the city, and with the fall of the Western Roman Empire the Visigoths established in the city. Talavera was known then as (Ak√ºis) or (Aibura). In the year 602, King Liuva II made a present to the city: the sculpture of the Virgin Mary, who was from then to the present day the symbol of the Christians in Talavera de la Reina, and the substitute for the goddess Ceres. In honour of the goddess Ceres, Talaverian Romans celebrated the spring festival called Mondas, which is still celebrated for the Virgin Mary. =Middle ages= An albarrana tower of the ancient city walls The Muslims conquered Talavera in 712. They built new walls and a castle in Talavera. They also brought the use of fountains, water mills and new products brought from Africa and Asia. The fertile soil produced quality vegetables, fruits and grass for animal feed. The markets gained new strength, and the population, a mixture of Christians, Muslims and Jews, lived in harmony for some centuries. Medina Al Talavayra took part in different wars between the kingdoms of Spain, becoming allied with C√≥rdoba and Badajoz. Alfonso VI of Le√≥n-Castile seized the city in 1083. The city was retaken temporarily by Muslims in 1109. Formerly a town, sometimes property of queens, such as Maria of Portugal, Talavera was transferred by Henry II of Castile on 25 June 1369 to G√≥mez Manrique (the transfer was confirmed in the 1371 Cortes of Toro), the Archbishop of Toledo, as payment for the latter's support in the Castilian Civil War, and, since then, the town became attached to the Archbishops of Toledo. The change from the concejo abierto towards a regimiento system of municipal government in Talavera should have happened by the second half of the 14th century. Unlike other locations the chief municipal public offices (regidur√≠as) in Talavera were not subject to transfer from father to son, so the nobiliary elite relied in an alternative strategy to ensure its supremacy, based on a system that allowed them to control the candidates to the regidor√≠a. King Sancho IV gave the royal privilege to hold two royal markets each year. =15th and 16th centuries= During the 15th and 16th centuries, Talavera achieved great recognition, thanks to its pottery. Wonderful pieces of pottery and Talavera tiles are found in the main museums of the world and in the most luxurious palaces all over Europe. Talaverian people participated in the conquest of America, like Francisco de Aguirre, Juan de Orellana and Jofr√©n de Loaisa. Other important Talaverian people were Hernando de Talavera, Isabella I of Castile's confessor, and the Admiral Francisco Verdugo. The beginning of the 16th century saw the release of the most important theater work in Spanish literature, The Tragicomedy of Calixto and Melibea, or Celestina, written by the Talaverian mayor Fernando de Rojas. By the late third of the 16th century the city reached a population of 10,000. =17th century= During this century the city lived in a golden age of arts and culture. Its main exponent is the father of Spanish History, Juan de Mariana, who wrote several books about history, law and politics, and who was very important for French revolutionary theories. =18th and 19th centuries= Upon the death of King Charles II in November 1700, two powerful nations fought for the Spanish Crown. Talavera supported Philip V's French faction, which was the winner. In the mid-18th century, by 1748, as part of the economic policies enforced by the Spanish Bourbons, the Royal Factory of Silk, Silver and Gold Fabric, was opened in the city, during the reign of Ferdinand VI. The Peninsular War had great consequences for Talavera. On 27 and 28 July 1809 the Battle of Talavera took place between the Anglo-Spanish army and the French. The Duke of Wellington's army expelled the French from the city. Iron Bridge in October 1908 The manufacturing complex of the Royal Silk Factory closed towards 1851. Talavera was granted the title of city (ciudad) in 1876. Following the and the ensuing installment of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, the local branch of the Patriotic Union (UP) formed in the city in March 1924 and the paramilitary in December 1924, during a event scheduled by Duchess of Talavera. A number of public events and demonstrations took place as part of the legitimization of the regime. The good connections of Mayor Justiniano L√≥pez Brea with provincial and national officeholders fostered several projects of public works in the later part of the dictatorial period. =Civil War and Franco period= The city was getting large during the beginning of the 20th century. The railroad brought new opportunities for improvement. In 1931 the Republic was the new political system in Spain. Talavera changed its name to Talavera del Tajo. The city had a population of 16,654 in 1936. On July 18, 1936, when the Nationalists had risen in arms, the Republicans opened a period of terror in Talavera, killing people. On September 3 the Nationalist army conquered Talavera and reopened the terror, this time against communists and socialists. During the rest of the war Talavera de la Reina was damaged by the Republican bombing attacks. The city had a population of 18,631 in 1940. During the Francoist dictatorship the Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci√≥n promoted a large irrigated zone in the surroundings of Talavera, following which two new settlements were created, called Talavera la Nueva and Alberche del Caudillo, the latter located in the neighboring Calera y Chozas municipality. During the 1960s a baby boom caused an increase in the population, added to by the immigrants coming from the nearby villages and poor areas of Extremadura. =Today= View of the city centre In 1975 Franco died, and democracy came to Spain. Talavera's first democratic mayor tried to create the province of Talavera, but the idea was not successful. The next mayor, Pablo Tello from the Socialist Party, made large projects such as the Alameda Park. In 1989 a feeling of marginalization enveloped the city, and a group of people called \\"Nosotros Talavera\\" (we Talavera) started fighting for the creation of a University Campus and other projects for the city. A Center for University Studies was opened in the city in 1994; it fully integrated as campus of the University of Castile-La Mancha (UCLM) four years later, in 1998.  Main sights  Rising over 192 metres, the , built in the outskirts of the city, is the highest bridge in Spain. Given the enormous cost and limited use, it is considered a wasteful investment.

A-class submarines moored in port HMS A13 model Design and construction While there was considerable variation amongst the boats of the class, they were around long and displaced around 200 tons when submerged. The first, A1 (ordered as Holland No. 6), was launched in July 1902, the last, A13, in April 1905. =Propulsion= All were propelled underwater by battery-powered electric motors and on the surface by shaft- drive Wolseley petrol engines of (A1), (A2-A4) or (A5-A12). A13 had an experimental Vickers diesel engine, which proved to be unreliable. =Armaments= Armament was two torpedo tubes with four torpedoes except for A1, which had 1 tube and 3 torpedoes. Service history This submarine class was plagued by numerous accidents and failures; almost every boat in the class (A1, A3, A4, A5, A7, and A8) was involved in some sort of accident over the course of their operational history. Many were fatal to the crew, and resulted in the decommissioning of the submarine. A1 was sunk off Portsmouth on 18 March 1904, in collision with the liner Berwick Castle, but raised and put back into service before finally being sunk as a naval gunnery target in 1911, followed in 1912 by A3. A7 was lost in Whitsand Bay in 1914 after diving into mud. A13 was laid up in 1914 due to engine unreliability. The remainder were used during World War I for harbour defence, A2 and A4, A5 and A6 at Portsmouth, A8 and A9 at Devonport, and A10, A11 and A12 at Ardrossan. All survived the war and were converted to training in 1918 and sold in 1919‚Äì1920 except for A2, which was wrecked while awaiting disposal and finally sold in 1925.

The portrait is located in the entrance hall of the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland Jeremiah Townley Chase (May 23, 1748 - May 11, 1828) was an American lawyer, jurist, and land speculator from Annapolis, Maryland. He served as a delegate for Maryland in the Continental Congress of 1783 and 1784, and for many years was chief justice of the state‚Äôs court of appeals. Early life  Chase was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Richard and Catherine Chase. When both his parents died in 1757 he was adopted by his uncle Reverend Thomas Chase, who was the Anglican rector of St. Paul's parish in Annapolis. (St. Paul's later became part of the American Episcopal Church.) His uncle also took over his education as he had done earlier for his own son, Samuel Chase.Owen M. Taylor, 2009. The History of Annapolis. Applewood Books. pp. 48‚Äì50. . When Jeremiah Chase was a young man, he followed his second cousin Samuel Chase to Annapolis. He read law in Samuel's office and was admitted to the bar of Anne Arundel County in 1771. Chase established a practice in both Annapolis and Baltimore, which he continued in Annapolis until 1791 with interruptions for public service. He never went into practice with his cousin but they made several appearances in court for the same clients, and a few as opponents. There were several young men who studied law with both cousins, especially when one was out of town. This list of men included Roger B. Taney who was later Chief Justice of the United States. He married Hester Baldwin on June 24, 1779. Political career  In 1773 Chase was elected to the Colonial House of Delegates. In 1774 he joined the prerevolutionary Maryland Committee of Correspondence for Baltimore and was elected to the revolutionary Annapolis Convention that created the state constitution of Maryland. In 1776 he attended the state's Constitutional Convention for Anne Arundel County. Under the new constitution he was elected to the House of Deputies in Baltimore from 1775 to 1777. Chase's adopted father, Rev. Chase, died in 1779 and after that Jeremiah moved fully to Annapolis. That same year he was named a member of Maryland's Executive Council, which functioned as the upper house of the legislature, and he would serve there until 1783, and later from 1785 to 1788. Chase was also Mayor of Annapolis in 1783 and 1784. Those same years he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, which held sessions for those years in Annapolis. It was there he became a friend of David Howell of Rhode Island. In 1788 Chase was a delegate to the Maryland convention called to ratify the United States Constitution. He was among those opposed to its adoption, believing that a Bill of Rights should be included. When the Bill of Rights was formally adopted by Congress in 1789, Chase generally became a supporter of the Federalist Party. He drafted the Northwest Ordinance of 1784 as part of its drafting committee. Jeremiah Chase and his cousin, John Francis Mercer vehemently opposed the Federal Constitution's ratification. Being elected to the state convention, he became an Antifederalist leader. Chase feared the Federalists would abolish state laws protecting personal rights, and he called for a federal bill of rights at the convention. Having owned 11 slaves, by mid 1780s Chase was of the opinion Maryland's slaves should be freed. At the 1788 state ratification convention he spoke against slavery being supported by a federal Constitution. He was one of 12 leaders who voted against the federal Constitution's ratification. Judicial career  Chase returned to state politics after the constitutional crisis. Despite his opposition to the Constitution, Chase was named as a justice in the state's General Court in 1789, serving for six years. He held the tax commissioner office of Anne Arundel County in 1788. As tax commissioner, together with Charles Ridgely and his cousin Samuel, he speculated in ex-Tory lands in Annapolis and the port of Baltimore. He also served in the Maryland State Senate in 1796, where he became a strong Republican in a Federalist state. In 1806 he was appointed chief justice of the Maryland Court of Appeals, for the third district, until 1826, retiring that year. Late life Jeremiah Chase remained married to Hester Baldwin until her death in 1823 and had five children: Richard, Frances, Hester, Matilda, and Catherine. He rented a wing of the Hammond House from Matthias Hammond as a law office. His residence was on nearby King George Street. In 1811 he purchased the Hammond-Harwood House for his eldest daughter Frances Lookcerman to live in with her husband Richard Loockerman. It was customary for the father in law to give the deed to his son in law. However, Judge Chase did not trust his son in law, and kept the deed in his name. When Chase died at home in 1828, he was buried in the City Cemetery, or St. Anne's Cemetery in Annapolis. Some of his land was confiscated by the state from former Tories.Jon L. Wakelyn, 2004.

Making his debut as one of the original seven playable characters in Mortal Kombat in 1992, he is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge for his death at the hands of Quan Chi. One of the franchise's signature characters, Scorpion has been playable in nearly every Mortal Kombat fighting game, except for the original version of Mortal Kombat 3 (1995). He has represented the series in crossover fighting games and in guest roles in other games, while appearing in various official series merchandise and alternate media. Scorpion is featured on the logo of NetherRealm Studios, the successor of Midway Games. Appearances =Mortal Kombat games= \\"Scorpion\\" is the alias of Hanzo Hasashi, formerly one of the finest warriors of the Japanese Shirai Ryu ninja clan, until he was slain by Bi-Han, a member of the Lin Kuei (a rival clan of Chinese assassins) who worked under the name \\"Sub-Zero\\". Scorpion became a \\"hellspawn\\" revenant residing in Hell, later called the Netherrealm, who sought vengeance against those responsible for the destruction of his clan and the murder of his family, including his wife Harumi and his son Satoshi. Although essentially neutral in allegiance, Scorpion joins forces with anyone who can assist in his plans of revenge. He was once manipulated by the sorcerer Quan Chi, whom he promised his life to in exchange for his impressive kombat abilities in order to defeat Sub-Zero.Mike Harradence, In the Spotlight: Scorpion, PlayStation Universe, April 23rd, 2011. In his initial backstory, displayed in the first game's (1992) attract mode, he is described as only having enmity towards Sub- Zero, which was attributed to rivalries between their opposing ninja clans. His ending revealed that he was actually an undead specter who had been killed by Sub-Zero and was survived by a wife and child.Scorpion MK biography - Mortal Kombat Warehouse. Retrieved August 27, 2014. This was further explored in a tie-in comic book written and illustrated by MK co-creator John Tobias and published by Midway. In a one-page scene, set aboard a junk en route to Mortal Kombat tournament host Shang Tsung's private island, Scorpion shocks Sub-Zero with his unexpected return exactly two years after his death, declaring that his \\"demons\\" had allowed him to return and avenge his demise. After Shokan Prince Goro's defeat at the hands of eventual champion Liu Kang, Shang Tsung's army launched an attack, forcing Scorpion to team up with Sub- Zero, the thunder god Raiden, and other tournament survivors to hold them back before he killed his rival and disappeared. In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Scorpion discovers Sub-Zero has somehow returned, and planned to compete in the second Mortal Kombat tournament held in the otherworldly dimension of Outworld and hosted by the realm's emperor Shao Kahn. He tracks his nemesis down but notices, in the process, Sub-Zero sparing the life of an opponent in battle. Scorpion realizes that this is not Bi-Han, but instead his younger brother, Kuai Liang, who had taken on his brother's codename in his memory and was tasked with completing his failed mission of assassinating Shang Tsung. As a result, Scorpion vowed to serve as the new Sub-Zero's guardian in atonement for killing his older brother.Scorpion MKII ending - Mortal Kombat Warehouse. Retrieved August 27, 2014. In the 2005 beat 'em up spin-off Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, set during the events of Mortal Kombat II, Scorpion is a boss character who attempts to kill the game's playable protagonists Liu Kang and Kung Lao. He appears in both masked and unmasked forms, with the latter being named \\"Inferno Scorpion\\". The planned co-op game, Mortal Kombat: Fire & Ice, which would have starred Scorpion and Sub-Zero as the protagonists, was canceled when Paradox Development, the developers of Shaolin Monks, \\"couldn't do it in time and under budget.\\" Scorpion, along with all of the game's palette-swapped human ninja characters, was not playable in Mortal Kombat 3, but returned in the 1995 upgrade Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 when Shao Kahn tried to conquer the Netherrealm after his invasion of Earth, and enlisted the ninja in his forces. Scorpion's allegiance to the Kahn quickly dissolved when he discovers, in a continuance of his MKII storyline, that Sub-Zero was one of Earth's chosen warriors, with whom he sided in their final showdown with Shao Kahn. Quan Chi was officially introduced into Scorpion's rivalry with Sub-Zero in the main MK storyline, starting with Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero (1997). Scorpion is featured therein as an unplayable boss character, appearing twice throughout the game. Despite playing a minor role, his background was officially expanded in a feature on the game's official website, where his real name and that of his clan were revealed, while his yellow outfit was described as an apparent mockery of the Lin Kuei after former Lin Kuei member Takeda developed ninjutsu before leaving the clan and forming the rival Shirai Ryu. Scorpion is enlisted by Quan Chi to find a map hidden in a Shaolin temple, a task the sorcerer also gave to Sub-Zero in order to engage the two rival ninjas in combat. If the player performs a killer move on Scorpion, he will reappear as another boss later in the game. In Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), Quan Chi tricked Scorpion into believing that Sub-Zero was involved in the deaths of his family and clan, resulting in the specter allying with him. In Scorpion's ending, he emerges victorious over Sub-Zero, but Quan Chi reveals his involvement in killing Scorpion's clan and family. When the sorcerer attempts to banish Scorpion, the latter grabs the former at the last minute, sending them both to the Netherrealm. A variation of this ending was seen in Sub-Zero's conclusion, when Sub-Zero stands over a fallen Scorpion before being knocked down by Quan Chi, who again reveals his scheme and claims that both ninjas were pawns for the fallen Elder God Shinnok, which results in Scorpion killing Quan Chi and declaring Sub-Zero free of his curse. Scorpion's MK4 ending is carried over into Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002), where he relentlessly hunts down Quan Chi, only to be attacked by the Oni Drahmin and Moloch, whom the sorcerer had hired as protection and to help free him from the Netherrealm. In his non-canonical ending, Scorpion is killed when Drahmin and Moloch hurl him into a Soulnado, a magical tornado consisting of tormented souls trapped between Earthrealm and Outworld. In Scorpion's biography in Mortal Kombat: Deception however, he is depicted as having escaped as well. He meets the Elder Gods, which, coupled with his witnessing Raiden's death and the emergence of Onaga, the Dragon King, causes him to accept a new role as the Elder Gods' servant while working to prevent Onaga's merging of the realms. In the Konquest mode of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006), Scorpion cuts a deal with the Elder Gods to serve them in exchange for the resurrection of the Shirai Ryu and his wife and son. However, they resurrect them as undead beings. Enraged, Scorpion seeks to destroy the Elder Gods' chance of preventing Armageddon by taking the elemental Blaze's power, but the Edenian demigod Taven defeats him and he is later killed by Sub-Zero in a battle royal amongst the series characters in the game's opening sequence. In the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot, an alternative-timeline retelling of the first three titles, Scorpion reprises his role from the first game in seeking vengeance against the elder Sub-Zero, Bi-Han. This time though, he serves Quan Chi from the start, unaware that the sorcerer is the mastermind behind the murder of his family and clan. Raiden, attempting to alter the timeline in hopes of averting Armageddon, talks Scorpion into sparing Sub- Zero's life in exchange for reviving the Shirai Ryu. Scorpion agrees, and when he defeats Sub-Zero in the Netherrealm, he refuses to kill him. However, Quan Chi convinces Scorpion otherwise by showing him a graphic vision of Sub-Zero murdering his wife and child. Despite Sub-Zero protests, Scorpion promptly incinerates him. He reappears on the tournament grounds holding Sub-Zero's skull and spinal column. Later in the game, the younger Sub-Zero Kuai Liang seeks revenge for his brother's death by demanding a fight with Scorpion in Shao Kahn's arena, which Quan Chi grants. Scorpion immediately recognizes the new Sub-Zero as the original's younger brother, and while he is defeated, Kuai Liang is apprehended by his clan before he finish the revenant off. Scorpion is last seen when he fights and loses to Raiden in the Netherrealm before disappearing. In his non-canonical arcade ending, the Shirai Ryu appear before Scorpion as ghostly apparitions who reveal the truth about their murder and aid him in killing Quan Chi for his deception. In Sub-Zero's ending, he learns the truth about his and Scorpion's families and offers the specter a chance to join him in his quest for vengeance. Scorpion accepts, joining Sub-Zero to form their own Deadly Alliance. In Mortal Kombat X, which takes place two years after the previous game, Scorpion was sent to attack the Special Forces alongside a revenant version of Kuai Liang. Due to the efforts of Raiden and his allies however, they were restored to their human forms and freed from Quan Chi's control. Over the course of the following two decades, the newly restored Hanzo Hasashi reformed the Shirai Ryu, trained Kenshi's son Takeda Takahashi, and made amends with the young Sub-Zero after he revealed Quan Chi was responsible for the murder of his family and clan. When the Special Forces captured Quan Chi, a revenge-minded Hasashi subdued them and released the sorcerer so he could challenge him to a final fight before he killed him. Concurrently, Quan Chi's associate D'Vorah appeared so she could have the sorcerer free Shinnok from his amulet. Hasashi decapitated Quan Chi, but not before he could finish reciting a spell to successfully free the fallen Elder God, who immediately incapacitated everyone in the surrounding area. In Mortal Kombat 11, Hasashi continues to lead the Shirai Ryu in protecting Earthrealm as its Grandmaster a further two years after MKX and Shinnok's defeat. When the keeper of time Kronika caused a time anomaly in an attempt to erase Raiden from history, she brought a past version of Scorpion to the present so she could recruit him to her fold with the promise of resurrecting his clan and family. Meanwhile, Hasashi worked with Sub-Zero to foil Lin Kuei clansman turned cyber ninja Sektor and his plans to build a Cyber Lin Kuei army. They were successful, despite facing opposition from Bi-Han, who had been resurrected as the revenant Noob Saibot, and learning that Sektor played a role in murdering Hasashi's clan and family. After Kronika's forces compromise or destroy most of their bases, Hasashi agrees to house his Earthrealm allies at the Shirai Ryu's Fire Gardens. To help locate Kronika's Keep, Hasashi suggests forging an alliance with Kharon, a ferryman who transports unfortunate souls to the Netherrealm who he and Sub-Zero met while they were revenants. He succeeds in recruiting Kharon and convincing his younger self to turn away from Kronika, but he is killed by D'Vorah. With his dying breath, he urges his younger self to abandon his pursuit of vengeance and defend Earthrealm. Scorpion keeps his word and joins the allied forces of Earthrealm and Outworld to stop Kronika. In his non-canonical arcade ending, the younger Scorpion fails to keep his promise to his future self, and kills Kronika so he can restart history to ensure his loved ones' survival. When he discovers that otherworldly forces conspire to make sure the tragedy always repeats itself, he undergoes a quest for revenge against them. Other games Scorpion appears in the 2008 crossover title Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, participating in the war between the two titular franchises. In his ending, the essence of Dark Kahn finds a host in Scorpion's body, making him the most powerful being in the universe. Scorpion joined the cast of 2013's Injustice: Gods Among Us as a downloadable character. In his single-player battle ending, wondering how he ended up in this world, Scorpion confronted the demon Trigon, who summoned him out of anger that he had left his demon army and robbed him the glory of defeating the One-Earth High Councilor (Superman). Scorpion fights and defeats Trigon before taking command of his demonic forces, which he plans to use to rule the world.

Character design and gameplay  Scorpion appeared in the first Mortal Kombat as one of three palette-swapped ninja characters along with Sub-Zero and Reptile. His early origins were revealed by the series' original chief character designer John Tobias in September 2011 when he posted several pages of old pre-production character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as \\"[a] palette swap for 2 ninjas‚Äîa hunter and the hunted,\\" while Tobias also considered the concepts of either one of them fleeing their clan, or a \\"revenge story\\" involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans.John Tobias (@therealsaibot) on Twitter, September 2011 In regards to the game's strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon recalled: \\"A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and so we knew that if we could take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we'd save a lot of money and we'd have two characters.\\" Scorpion was given a yellow palette with the developers deciding that it would symbolize fire as the exact opposite to Sub-Zero's ice blue, which \\"prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan- type characters.\\"Creating Scorpion and Sub-Zero - Ed Boon's 12 Best Mortal Kombat Memories - Complex, September 2012.

While his ninja-outfit template from the first generation of games has remained relatively unchanged over time, the software technology of the post-Mortal Kombat 4 three-dimensional releases have allowed more detailed costuming for the characters, and Scorpion's costumes were duly enhanced with objects such as two katana swords strapped to his back and his spear attached to a rope tied to his belt in Deadly Alliance,Scorpion Deadly Alliance biography - Mortal Kombat Warehouse.

Retrieved August 30, 2014. Scorpion was included with Sub-Zero, Reptile and Ermac in a bundle of classic costumes from the first Mortal Kombat that was released as downloadable content for the 2011 reboot. For Injustice: Gods Among Us, he received a new costume designed by comic artist Jim Lee. In the original Mortal Kombats fighter-selection screen, Scorpion had regular human eyes, as his identity as a resurrected specter was meant to be a mystery, but he was given solid yellow or white eyes for every release thereafter starting with MKII, while actors portraying Scorpion in live-action media such as the feature films and the Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series were outfitted with opaque contact lenses in order to achieve this effect. Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon has voiced Scorpion in a special move and has regarded him as his favorite character. Scorpion yells one of two taunts‚Äî\\"Get over here!\\" and \\"Come here!\\"‚Äîat his opponents when he hits them with his spear. They were voiced by Boon in the games and both feature films, but only one of them (\\"Come here!\\") was included in the home ports of MK and MKII due to memory constraints. According to Boon, the second of the character's phrases originated because he thought \\"it would be funny to have him yell out 'Get over here!' when he [threw the spear],\\" and he was thus encouraged to get behind the studio microphone and record the taunts. As confirmed by Daniel Pesina, that phrase was originally an idea of Kano's actor Richard Divizio, as was Scorpion's skull face, inspired by the classic film Jason and the Argonauts. Twenty years after the first MK game's release, Boon included creating the spear move as well as the character itself among his personal high points of the franchise's history, adding: \\"I remember people sitting in my office all day just doing this uppercut [on a speared enemy] again and again, like 'Oh my God, that feels so good.' It just became the cornerstone of [the game].\\"Reyan Ali, Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories, Complex.com, September 12, 2012. MKII saw the debut of the popular phrase \\"Toasty!\\", which was voiced by series sound designer Dan Forden during a variation of Scorpion's \\"Flaming Skull\\" Fatality or at random when any of the game's characters landed an uppercut. According to Tobias, it first originated as \\"You're Toast!\\", which was a taunt bandied among the designers during game-testing sessions.Making of Mortal Kombat 3: Into the Outworld - Midway Games/Williams Entertainment, 1995. Scorpion's signature special move throughout the series has him hurling a harpoon-like spear (described as a kunai) at his opponents, making him the only other character besides Kano to have a physical weapon in the first Mortal Kombat. The spear, attached to a length of rope, impales his opponents through the chest and sets them up for a free hit as Scorpion then jerks on the rope to pull them in to close range. This move was designed by Pesina, who did not like the original lasso move as it reminded him of that of Wonder Woman, and inspired by the ancient Asian weapons known as a rope dart. His other incumbent special throughout the series, save for Deadly Alliance, has been his Teleport Punch, where he flies offscreen during battle and then reappears to strike his opponent from behind. Scorpion additionally gained a new leg-takedown maneuver in MKII that was not well-received (Sega Saturn Magazine called it a \\"ridiculous\\" move that \\"no one ever used\\").Lomas, Ed.

Sega Saturn Magazine (April 1996), p. 48 He was considered a lower-tier character by GamePro in their 1993 MKII character rankings, rating him eighth out of the game's twelve playables and describing both him and Sub-Zero as \\"formerly a top-tier character [who] doesn‚Äôt have much of a chance in MKII since all of the male ninjas have some poor matchups,\\" with Scorpion faring the worst against Jax and Mileena. Ed Lomas of Sega Saturn Magazine described the character as having \\"simple yet effective\\" special moves in UMK3 that \\"make him good for beginners, [which] doesn't stop him from being a useful character,\\" while his \\"trusty\\" spear was \\"perfect for setting up combos.\\" GameSpy, in their Deception walkthrough, described the character as \\"a well- rounded character that has strengths in combos as well as in special and normal moves.\\" They additionally described the spear as \\"useful as ever\\" in Armageddon, adding, \\"Between [that and his] other special moves ... Scorpion pretty much has everything covered.\\" Prima Games' MK2011 strategy guide considered Scorpion to be well-balanced with no distinct weaknesses or advantages, while winning more than half of his fights against the game's other characters.Jason Wilson, Adam Hernandez, Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide, Prima Games 2011 (p. 208). He is also a playable character for both the versus and story modes in Shaolin Monks, where his move sets in this game are largely identical to Liu Kang's with some original techniques. Scorpion's signature finishing move from the original game up until Mortal Kombat 4 was his \\"Fire Breath\\" Fatality, in which he removes his mask to reveal a skull right before immolating his opponent. A variation of this finisher was included in MKII: entering a different button/joystick combination added the spoken \\"Toasty!\\" phrase that simultaneously appeared on the screen. While the \\"Fire Breath\\" was brought back for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe in 2008, his spear has otherwise served as his primary tool in his Fatalities in the three-dimensional games, from impaling his opponents through the head and then decapitating them in Deadly Alliance, using it to yank off their limbs in Deception, and plunging it into their chest before kicking them through a portal that left nothing but a skinned corpse hanging from the spear's chain in MK2011 (\\"Nether Gate\\"). His second Fatality in the reboot, \\"Split Decision\\", had Scorpion using one of his back-mounted swords to hack his opponent to pieces. Scorpion would indirectly play a role in the fabrication of the-then nonexistent character Ermac when Electronic Gaming Monthly published a doctored screenshot of Scorpion from the original game in 1993. A lot of other characters in MK1 like Chameleon use his template. This subsequently spawned false player rumors of a glitch that would turn Scorpion's sprite red with the name \\"Error Macro\\" appearing in the energy bar. Ermac became playable in UMK3, in which he was a red palette swap of Scorpion who shared his Teleport Punch. =Other media= Literature In Jeff Rovin's 1995 non-canon novelization, set before the first game, Scorpion plays a minor role and his backstory deviates from the games, as he is something of a combination of a father and son instead of an individual ninja specter. The father, a former Lin Kuei member turned tolltaker named Yong Park, was killed by Sub-Zero in front of Park's family and his body dumped into a canal. Yong's spirit merges with his young son Tsui's body in order for the latter to seek revenge under the form of Scorpion, during which his costume and armor magically appear on his body. When Scorpion challenges Sub-Zero to battle in hopes of avenging his father's murder, they do nothing more than exchange words before Sub-Zero sets off a smoke bomb and escapes. Scorpion never uses his spear aside from a scene in which he shoots it at a tree as a test shortly after his transformation. With the exception of the novel, Scorpion has been portrayed in alternate Mortal Kombat media as an antagonist, and his spear was never used in any sort of graphic nature as in the games. In the Mortal Kombat series produced by Malibu Comics, he is simply a specter consumed by revenge against Sub-Zero, and his spear was changed to a weapon resembling a spiked morning star that was attached to a whip-long length of either chain or rope. An altered version of his confrontation with Sub-Zero from the Midway comic was expanded in the first issue of the 1994 Blood & Thunder miniseries, by way of a one-page flashback of their fateful battle that ends with Scorpion being killed off-panel. Scorpion, along with the other series characters from the first game, seeks to solve all the riddles inside Shang Tsung's mystical tome, the Tao Te Zhan, in order to gain absolute power (which no one accomplishes). In the third issue, the combatants are all imprisoned inside Shang Tsung's dungeon before Scorpion appears and frees them from their bonds, and in the fourth issue, when the fighters are stranded in Outworld after Raiden frees them from the dungeon, Scorpion kills Hydro, a Lin Kuei companion of Sub-Zero created exclusively for the series. Sub-Zero then destroys Scorpion's mortal form in a quick battle, and Scorpion (now an apparition) is then driven off by Raiden, who then declares that Sub-Zero was now under his protection. Scorpion was additionally featured in a special #0 issue as the centerpiece of a short story titled Kombatants, which was originally published prior to the miniseries and has him facing Sub-Zero once more as the other combatants sing his praises in the background. The first page of the third issue of Blood & Thunder, which showed Scorpion hurling his weapon at an off-panel Sub-Zero, was a near-exact duplicate of Kombatants title page.Kombatants and Blood & Thunder title pages - 4thletter.net. Retrieved August 27, 2014. During the \\"Tournament Edition\\" double-issue conclusion of the miniseries, Scorpion loses a fight to Kitana, who had stopped him beforehand from killing an unconscious Sub-Zero. In the 1995 Battlewave miniseries, Outworld emperor Shao Kahn returns Scorpion to the living world using a mystical gem called the Deathstone, which also allows Kahn to resurrect an army of undead soldiers under his control with Scorpion as his general; his army replaces the mutants that engrossed his ranks. One of the warriors under Scorpion's command was the twin-fighting monk duo Siang, who had been killed by Goro in the Blood & Thunder miniseries and was resurrected but still maintained a mind of his own, and therefore wanted to escape Kahn's control; Scorpion therefore fatally stabs Siang through the heart in a mercy killing before destroying the Deathstone. In a 1995 one-shot featuring Baraka, titled \\"Babality\\", Scorpion still possesses the Deathstone and attempts to abduct an Outworld mutant baby who is under Baraka's protection, but he is thwarted by Noob Saibot before Baraka destroys the gem. Film and television Chris Casamassa as Scorpion in the 1995 film Mortal Kombat. His initial design had looked \\"nothing like in the games\\", but was changed later. Scorpion was played by Chris Casamassa in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film. His rivalry with Sub-Zero is only mentioned in passing by Shang Tsung in the storyline, which instead had them both serving as his slaves under his command. Scorpion's spear was a living snake-like creature that shot from a slit in his palm and could fly to a limited extent. It is first seen when he engages in a standoff with Johnny Cage on Shang Tsung's ship, and later during his fight in the tournament against Cage that begins in a rubber tree forest, when the spear directly follows Cage until it goes completely taut with Cage just out of reach. Scorpion fires the creature a second time, but Cage dodges it and it fatally smashes into a tree. The fight continues in Scorpion's lair until Cage finally wounds Scorpion with several discarded weapons right after Scorpion performs his \\"Fire Breath\\" Fatality as an offensive move, causing Scorpion to burst into flames as he bleeds a glowing lava-like blood before exploding entirely. Scorpion's lair was constructed inside an airplane hangar and was not included in the script nor the movie novelization, in which Cage merely knocks Scorpion out in the forest with his Shadow Kick. The character briefly returned in the 1997 sequel film Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, where he again worked for a higher power, this time Shao Kahn. Following a failed assassination attempt on Liu Kang and Kitana by Smoke and one of Kahn's extermination squads due to the unexpected interference of the younger Sub-Zero, Scorpion confronts the would- be targets, but ends up dueling Sub-Zero instead. After incapacitating Sub- Zero, he kidnaps Kitana and escapes through a portal. He was portrayed by J.J. Perry, who played Cyrax. Casamassa reprised his role from the first film in several episodes of the 1998-1999 TV series Mortal Kombat: Conquest with an origin different from that in the games. Scorpion commands his lover, Peron, to murder Sub-Zero's sister, and Sub-Zero kills Peron in retaliation, culminating in a duel which ends in a draw due to the arrival of Kung Lao, Siro, and Taja, who come to Sub-Zero's aid. Both Peron and Sub-Zero's sister were noncanonical characters created exclusively for the show. In the 1995 animated film Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, Scorpion was again depicted as a henchman to Shang Tsung opposite Sub-Zero. The backstory relationship of Scorpion and Sub-Zero is explored during the course of the film in a computer- animated fight sequence. He made one appearance in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm in the second episode (\\"Sting of the Scorpion\\"). His rivalry with Sub-Zero is vaguely explored, as no explicit mention is ever made of Sub-Zero killing him. Scorpion instead serves as an independent entity of evil, while his spear was depicted as a green snake-like head attached to a length of chain. In the 2010 live-action short film Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, directed by Kevin Tancharoen, Scorpion, addressed therein by his real name, is depicted as a voluntary prisoner being questioned by Deacon City police captain Jackson Briggs regarding an underground tournament hosted by Shang Tsung. Sonya Blade shows up late in the film with a confidential document stating that Scorpion had killed Sub-Zero's brother. Knowing that Sub-Zero will enter Shang Tsung's deadly tournament, Scorpion agrees to participate and leave no one alive. He was played by Ian Anthony Dale and appears as a normal human, though his eyes are completely white and his signature weapon does appear. Ian Anthony Dale as Scorpion in the 2013 second season of Mortal Kombat: Legacy. Dale, who has a background in kung fu, said that after rehearsals, his \\"arms and shoulders felt like they had daggers in them,\\" while the contacts he wore were \\"cumbersome\\" Dale reprised his role as Scorpion in both seasons of Tancharoen's Mortal Kombat: Legacy webseries. In a two-part episode in the 2011 first season, his story takes place in feudal Japan, when Hanzo Hasashi is the leader of the Shirai Ryu and a family man training his young son, Jubei, in combat, much to his wife's disapproval. Hanzo is later summoned to a meeting with the shogun, which turns out to be a ruse by Bi-Han (Sub-Zero) of the rival Lin Kuei clan in order to lure Hanzo away from his village and leave it open to attack, which Hanzo realizes after he finds the shogun murdered in the middle of an icy road. After subduing Sub- Zero in battle, he returns to his village to find his family slain before he himself is killed from behind by Sub-Zero. Shang Tsung appears with Sub-Zero, who reveals himself as Quan Chi. Quan Chi resurrects Scorpion as a specter and promises him revenge against Sub-Zero in exchange for his services. The dialogue of Scorpion, his family, and Sub-Zero were in Japanese with English subtitles, and the use of Scorpion's spear is faithful to the games for the first time in any alternate media in that it actually pierces Sub-Zero's chest before Scorpion reels him in for a hit, but no blood is shown. In the 2013 second season, a flashback shows that Hanzo and Bi-Han were childhood friends but driven apart by the mutual disdain of their clans. Two decades later, the Shirai Ryu and Lin Kuei have made some effort towards reconciliation, but Hasashi, while with his wife and son, encounters Bi-Han's younger brother, Kuai Liang, who provokes a fight and is killed by Hanzo offscreen. Hanzo and Bi-Han later meet to discuss the incident, and both are shown to be honorable men committed to maintaining the truce between their clans. Bi-Han swears that there will be no repercussions against the Shirai Ryu for Kuai's death, but after the events of season one, the resurrected Hanzo (now Scorpion) is convinced of Bi-Han's culpability in his family's and clan's deaths, not knowing that Bi-Han is not responsible and is instead incensed about the attack that he believes was carried out by his own Lin Kuei warriors. In the present day, Bi-Han and Scorpion fight in the Mortal Kombat tournament, during which Scorpion stabs his spear into Bi-Han's ankle. Despite Bi-Han's pleas that he was not involved in the death of his clan and family, Scorpion rips out his spine. This storyline was played out over the seventh and eighth episodes and filmed entirely in English. Dale said that the series \\"challenge[s] the assumptions that [Scorpion and Sub-Zero] have always been sworn enemies‚Äîwe have new layers in their story and rivalries.\\" Scorpion is the titular protagonist of the animated film Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge. The film follows the basic contours of the first game's storyline, as well as Scorpion's origins and past life as Hanzo Hasashi and the murder of his family and clan by Sub-Zero (actually Quan Chi in disguise) and the Lin Kuei. He is shown to more explicitly aid the Earthrealm warriors in the Mortal Kombat tournament before achieving his goal of avenging his family and clan by killing Quan Chi in combat. Hiroyuki Sanada will portray Scorpion in the 2021 reboot of the film series. =Promotion and merchandise= Along with the original series characters, Scorpion was highlighted on an individual track from The Immortals' 1994 album Mortal Kombat: The Album, titled \\"Lost Soul Bent on Revenge\\".

The character was featured along with Raiden, Ermac, Jax, and Shang Tsung in a 2014 animated short film produced by Comedy Central that parodied the Mortal Kombat games. =Critical reception and popularity= Scorpion, along with Sub-Zero, is often regarded as one of the most popular and iconic characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise, and in the fighting-game genre in general. SuperGamePower gave him and Ryu from Street Fighter a shared award for the best fighter of 1996. Game Informer rated Scorpion the third best fighting game character in 2009, while UGO Networks ranked Scorpion second only to the series' main protagonist Liu Kang in their 2012 list of the top characters in the franchise. PLAY magazine ranked him fourth on their list of top ninja characters in 2013.PLAY 232, page 34. Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar, in 2012, ranked him as the seventh best fighting game character in the genre's history due to the \\"coolness of his 'undead antagonist' factor. Despite the fact that he started out as a mere palette swap, Scorpion‚Äôs appeal made him a frontrunner in every major MK game to date.\\"Lucas Sullivan, The Top 7‚Ä¶ Best fighting game characters, GamesRadar, September 10, 2012 Complex featured Scorpion in a whole host of best-of lists: he was ranked the fifth-most brutal fighter in the series and the 15th best video game mascot, in addition to Complex naming him the fourth-\\"most dominant\\" fighting game character in 2012.Elton Jones, The 50 Most Dominant Fighting Game Characters, Complex.com, May 17, 2012. the 23rd \\"most badass\\" video game character of all time,Drea Avellan, The 50 Most Badass Video Game Characters Of All Time, Complex.com, February 1, 2013.

Sharing the fifth spot on the top video-game ninja list by PC World in 2009.Top Ten video game ninjas, PC World Australia, 6 August 2010. He tied with Sub-Zero at the top of Game Revolution's 2006 list of the top ten \\"old school\\" MK characters, and a 2011 GamesRadar article discussed their evolution across the Mortal Kombat series, citing them as its two most popular characters. Together, Scorpion and Sub-Zero were voted the fifth most iconic characters in the two-decade history of the PlayStation by readers of PlayStation Official Magazine ‚Äì UK in 2015. GamePro ranked Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and the other ninjas from the series third in their 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, adding that Midway Games \\"has turned the art of making new characters from other, different-colored characters into a science.\\" Special moves and Fatalities have been mostly very well received. In 2010, IGN listed Scorpion's \\"Flaming Skull\\" as the second best MK Fatality without specifying any particular title in the series, due to how the player's perception of the character changes when he removes his mask. They called it an \\"enduring classic\\", noting that the finisher was notably unchanged in future games as a result of its connection with the character. His spear attack was ranked ninth in GameSpot's 2002 list of the top ten fighting-game special moves of all time as the single most powerful yet balanced attack in the original game, as well as for its initial shock value, furthermore deeming it \\"the definitive Mortal Kombat move.\\" The \\"Nether Gate\\" from MK2011 was included by FHM on their list of the game's nine most brutal Fatalities. His MKII Friendship, shared with Sub-Zero and Reptile, placed in Prima Games' 2014 list of the series' top 50 Fatalities, in addition to the \\"Nether Gate\\", his stage Fatality from MK2011, and the \\"Flaming Skull\\" from the original MK. We Got This Covered ranked the \\"Nether Gate\\" among the reboot's top finishers: \\"Sub-Zero does another spine rip in this game, but it‚Äôs not as repulsive as it was a decade ago. Scorpion, however, has found a new way to use his favorite weapon for maximum damage.\\" Paste rated it the fourth best Fatality from MK2011, in addition to rating the \\"Flaming Skull\\" as the third best finisher from the first game. However, his Animality from UMK3/Trilogy (a penguin that lays an exploding egg) tied with that of Rain as the eighth worst finisher in the series according to GamePro. Scorpion's catchphrase \\"Get over here!\\" was listed in PLAYs joke list of ten best chat-up lines. According to PlayStation Universe in 2011, Scorpion \\"has spawned one of the most iconic catchphrases in gaming history\\" and \\"remains a firm fan favorite nineteen years since his debut.\\" The phrase was a factor in ScrewAttack ranking Scorpion first on their list of the top series characters.

The first major form of modern Djiboutian music began in the mid-1940s, when Djibouti was a part of the French Somaliland. Djiboutian music is characterized by poetry, so that listening to a Djiboutian song is first paying attention to its meaning. The artist rocks the listeners in the cheerfulness of the refrains and the turn of the sentences. Often sung by a couple, a song is played in the form of a sleight of hand between a man and a woman, one recounting his feelings and his love, even his passion for the other, until the other accepts or rejects this offer. The Djiboutian song is also distinguished by the \\"Gouux\\", a deep and sensual voice which highlights the artist's passion for his work. Overview Djibouti is a multiethnic country. The two largest ethnic groups are the Somali and the Afar. There are also a number of Arab, Ethiopian and European (French and Italian) residents. Traditional Afar music resembles the folk music of other parts of the Horn of Africa such as Ethiopia; it also contains elements of Arabic music. The history of Djibouti is recorded in the poetry and songs of its nomadic people, and goes back thousands of years to a time when the peoples of Djibouti traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, India and China. Afar oral literature is also quite musical. It comes in many varieties, including songs for weddings, war, praise and boasting. \\\\- Website no longer exists; link is to Internet Archive Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali folklore. Most Somali songs are pentatonic; that is, they only use five pitches per octave in contrast to a heptatonic (seven note) scale such as the major scale. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Modern Djiboutian popular music can be traced back to the late 1940s, Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (midho), songwriters (laxan), and singers (codka or \\"voice\\"). Balwo is a Somali musical style centered on love themes that is popular in Djibouti.Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, Culture and Customs of Somalia, (Greenwood Press: 2001), pp.170‚Äì172. \\"Dhooley\\" sung by Abdo Xamar Qoodh \\"Maadoora\\" sung by Abayazid Badri ft Dinkara Band The national anthem of Djibouti is \\"Djibouti\\", adopted in 1977 with words by Aden Elmi and music by Abdi Robleh. \\"Miniature poetry\\", invented by a truck driver named Abdi Deeqsi, is well known in Djibouti; these are short poems (balwo), mostly concerning love and passion. They perform music and dance from two of Djibouti's main ethnic groups (Somali, Afar), they feature regularly on Djiboutian radio and television shows and perform as representatives of Djiboutian culture around the world. This festival draws performers from all over the country, and live recordings of headliner acts have proved popular with international audiences. Among the best-known performers are the Dinkara and A√Ødarous. The government sponsors several organizations dedicated to the preservation of traditional culture and dance. Djiboutian traditional instruments include the tanbura, bowl lyre and oud. Music institutions The first radio station in Djibouti to air popular Djibouti music was (ORTF) Radio based in Djibouti. It started broadcasting in 1940 in French, Somali, Afar and Arabic. Djiboutian music is now regularly broadcast on the state-run Radio Television of Djibouti.

An anti-tank mine (abbreviated to \\"AT mine\\") is a type of land mine designed to damage or destroy vehicles including tanks and armored fighting vehicles. Compared to anti-personnel mines, anti-tank mines typically have a much larger explosive charge, and a fuze designed only to be triggered by vehicles or, in some cases, tampering with the mine. History = US Civil War = While obviously the anti-tank mine as such did not pre- date the deployment of tanks in 1916, essentially identical devices were used earlier against locomotives. For example, during the U.S. Civil War, Confederate forces created pressure-activated anti-railroad mines which destroyed at least two trains. =First World War= The first anti-tank mines were improvised during the First World War as a countermeasure against the first tanks introduced by the British towards the end of the war. Initially they were nothing more than a buried high-explosive shell or mortar bomb with its fuze upright. Later, purpose-built mines were developed, including the Flachmine 17, which was simply a wooden box packed with explosives and triggered either remotely or by a pressure fuze. By the end of the war, the Germans had developed row mining techniques, and mines accounted for 15% of U.S. tank casualties during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Third Battle of the Aisne, Battle of Selle and Meuse-Argonne Offensive. =Inter-War= The Soviet Union began developing mines in the early 1920s, and in 1924 produced its first anti-tank mine, the EZ mine. The mine, which was developed by Yegorov and Zelinskiy, had a 1 kg charge, which was enough to break the tracks of contemporary tanks. Meanwhile, in Germany, defeat spurred the development of anti-tank mines, with the first truly modern mine, the Tellermine 29, entering service in 1929. It was a disc-shaped device approximately 30 cm across filled with about 5 kg of high explosives. A second mine, the Tellermine 35 was developed in 1935. Anti-tank mines were used by both sides during the Spanish Civil War. Notably, Republican forces lifted mines placed by Nationalist forces and used them against the Nationalists. This spurred the development of anti-handling devices for anti-tank mines. The Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland also saw widespread use of anti-tank mines. =Second World War= Soviet TM-35 mine at the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain, Sevastopol The German Tellermine was a purpose-built anti-tank mine developed during the period between the first and second world wars, the first model being introduced in 1929. Some variants were of a rectangular shape, but in all cases the outer casing served only as container for the explosives and fuze, without being used to destructive effect (e.g. shrapnel). Tellermine was the prototypical anti-tank mine, with many elements of its design emulated in the Pignone P-1, NR 25, and M6 mine (among others). Because of its rather high operating pressure, a vehicle would need to pass directly over top of the mine to set it off. But since the tracks represent only about 20% of a tank's width, the pressure fuse had a limited area of effect. As one source has it: \\"Since they were pressure-detonated, these early anti-tank mines typically did most of their damage to a tank's treads, leaving its crew unharmed and its guns still operational but immobilised and vulnerable to aircraft and enemy anti-tank weapons ... During World War II they (the Wehrmacht) began using a mine with a tilt-rod fuze, a thin rod standing approximately two feet up from the center of the charge and nearly impossible to see after the mine had been buried. As a tank passed over the mine, the rod was pushed forward, causing the charge to detonate directly beneath it. The blast often killed the crew and sometimes exploded onboard ammunition. Now that tank crews were directly at risk, they were less likely to plow through a minefield.\\" Although other measures such as satchel charges, sticky bombs and bombs designed to magnetically adhere to tanks were developed, they do not fall within the category of land mines as they are not buried and detonated remotely or by pressure. The Hawkins mine was a British anti-tank device that could be employed as a mine laid on the road surface for a tank to run over setting off a crush fuze or thrown at the tank in which case a timer fuze was used. Shaped charge devices like the Hohl-Sprung mine 4672 were also developed by Germany later in the war, although these did not see widespread use. The most advanced German anti-tank mine of the war was their minimal metal Topfmine. German Riegel mine 43 In contrast to the dinner plate mines such as the German Tellermine were bar mines such as the German Riegel mine 43 and Italian B-2 mine. These were long mines designed to increase the probability of a vehicle triggering it, the B2 consisted of multiple small shaped-charge explosive charges along its length designed to ensure a mobility kill against enemy vehicles by destroying their tracks. This form of mine was the inspiration for the British L9 bar mine. =Modern= Anti Tank Mine used by Indian Army Several advances have been made in the development of modern anti-tank mines, including: *more effective explosive payloads (different explosive compounds and shaped charge effects) *use of non-ferrous materials making them harder to detect *new methods of deployment (from aircraft or with artillery) *more sophisticated fuzes (e.g. triggered by magnetic and seismic effects, or which ignore the first target vehicle to drive over it, or which make a mine blast resistant) *sophisticated \\"anti- handling\\" devices to prevent or discourage tampering or removal. Design More modern anti-tank mines are usually more advanced than simple containers full of explosives detonated by remote or the vehicles pressure. The biggest advances were made in the following areas: *Power of the explosives (explosives such as RDX). *Shaped charges to increase the armour piercing effect. *Advanced dispersal systems. *More advanced or specific detonation triggers. Most modern mine bodies or casings are made of plastic material to avoid easy detection. They feature combinations of pressure or magnetically activated detonators to ensure that they are only triggered by vehicles. Dispersal systems There are several systems for dispersing mines to quickly cover wide areas, as opposed to a soldier laying each one individually. These system can take the form of cluster bombs or be artillery fired. Cluster bombs contain several mines each, which could be a mixture of anti-personnel mines. When the cluster bomb reaches a preset altitude it disperses the mines over a wide area. Some anti-tank mines are designed to be fired by artillery, and arm themselves once they impact the target area. Off-route mines Polish MPB mine. Off-route mines are designed to be effective when detonated next to a vehicle instead of underneath the vehicle. They are useful in cases where the ground or surface is not suitable for burying or concealing a mine. They normally employ a Misznay‚ÄìSchardin shaped charge to fire a penetrating slug through the target armour. This self forging projectile principle has been used for some French and Soviet off route mines and has earned infamy as an improvised explosive devices (IED) technique in Israel and especially Iraq. Due to the critical standoff necessary for penetration and the development of standoff neutralization technologies, shaped charge off-route mines using the Munroe effect are more rarely encountered, though the British/French/German ARGES mine with a tandem warhead is an example of one of the more successful. The term \\"off-route mine\\" refers to purpose designed and manufactured anti-tank mines. Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFPs) are one type of IED that was used in Iraq, but most \\"home made\\" IEDs are not employed in this manner. Countermeasures The most effective countermeasure deployed against mine fields is mine clearing, using either explosive methods or mechanical methods. Explosive methods, such as the Giant Viper and the SADF Plofadder 160 AT, involve laying explosives across a minefield, either by propelling the charges across the field with rockets, or by dropping them from aircraft, and then detonating the explosive, clearing a path. Mechanical methods include plowing and pressure-forced detonation. In plowing, a specially designed plow attached to the front end of a heavily armored tank is used to push aside the earth and any mines embedded in it, clearing a path as wide as the pushing tank. In pressure-forced detonation, a heavily armored tank pushes a heavy spherical or cylindrical solid metal roller ahead of it, causing mines to detonate. Casspir Personnel Carrier There are also several ways of making vehicles resistant to the effects of a mine detonation to reduce the chance of crew injury. In case of a mine's blast effect, this can be done by absorbing the blast energy, deflecting it away from the vehicle hull or increasing the distance between the crew and the points where wheels touch the ground‚Äìwhere any detonations are likely to centre. A simple, and highly effective, technique to protect the occupants of a wheeled vehicle is to fill the tires with water. This will have the effect of absorbing and deflecting the mine's blast energy. Steel plates between the cabin and the wheels can absorb the energy and their effectiveness is enhanced if they can be angled to deflect it away from the cabin. Increasing the distance between the wheels and passenger cabin, as is done on the South African Casspir personnel carrier, is an effective technique, although there are mobility and ease of driving problems with such a vehicle. A mine resistant vehicle can use a wedge-shaped passenger cabin, with the thin edge of the wedge downwards, to divert blast energy away from occupants. Improvised measures such as sandbags in the vehicle floor or bulletproof vests placed on the floor may offer a small measure of protection against tiny mines. Steel plates on the floor and sides and armoured glass will protect the occupants from fragments. Mounting seats from the sides or roof of the vehicle, rather than the floor, will help protect occupants from shocks transmitted through the structure of the vehicle and a four-point seat harness will minimise the chance of injury if the vehicle is flung onto its side or its roof‚Äìa mine may throw a vehicle 5 ‚Äì 10 m from the detonation point. Police and military can use a robot to remove mines from an area. https://www.army- technology.com/projects/uran-6-mine-clearing-robot/ Combat use Anti-tank mines have played an important role in most wars fought since they were first used. =Second World War= Anti-tank mines played a major role on the Eastern front, where they were used in huge quantities by Soviet troops. The most common AT mines included the TM-41, TM-44, TMSB, YAM-5, and AKS. In the Battle of Kursk, combat engineers laid a staggering 503,663 AT mines, for a density of 1500 mines per kilometer. This was four times greater than what was seen in the Battle of Moscow. Furthermore, mobile detachments were tasked with laying more mines directly in the path of advancing enemy tanks. According to one source: \\"... Each artillery battalion and, in some cases, each artillery battery, had a mobile reserve of 5 to 8 combat engineers equipped with 4 to 5 mines each. Their function was to mine unguarded tank approaches after the direction of the enemy attack had been definitely ascertained. These mines proved highly effective in stopping and even in destroying many enemy tanks.\\" The Wehrmacht also relied heavily on anti-tank mines to defend the Atlantic Wall, having planted six million mines of all types in Northern France alone. Mines were usually laid in staggered rows about 500 yards (460 meters) deep. Along with the anti-personnel types, there were various model of Tellermines, Topfmines, and Riegel mines. On the Western front, anti-tank mines were responsible for 20-22% of Allied tank losses.On Allied Tank Casualties in the ETO and German AT Weapons Since the majority of these mines were equipped with pressure fuzes (rather than tilt-rods), tanks were more often crippled than destroyed outright. =Indo-China= During the Vietnam War, both 'regular' NVA and Viet Cong forces used AT mines. These were of Soviet, Chinese or local manufacture. Anti-tank mines were also used extensively in Cambodia and along the Thai border, planted by Pol Pot's Maoist guerrillas and the Vietnamese army, which invaded Cambodia in 1979 to topple the Khmer Rouge. Millions of these mines remain in the area, despite clearing efforts. It is estimated that they cause hundreds of deaths annually.Anti-tank mine kills 7 Cambodian de- miners =Southern Africa= Conflict in southern Africa since the 1960s have often involved Soviet, United States or South African supported irregular armies or fighters engaged in guerrilla warfare. What makes these conflicts significant to the study of anti-tank mines is that they featured the widespread use of these mines in situations other than conventional warfare (or static minefields) and also saw the development of effective mine resistant vehicles. As a result, both Angola and Mozambique are littered with such devices to this day (as with Cambodia). In the Angolan Civil War or South African Border War that covered vast sparsely populated area of southern Angola and northern Namibia, it was easy for small groups to infiltrate and lay their mines on roads before escaping again often undetected. The anti-tank mines were most often placed on public roads used by civilian and military vehicles and had a great psychological effect. Mines were often laid in complex arrangements. One tactic was to lay multiple mines on top of each other to increase the blast effect. Another common tactic was to link together several mines placed within a few metres of each other, so that all would detonate when any one was triggered. RG-31 Mine Protected Armored Personnel Carrier (MP APC) in service with the US Army in Iraq in 2006 It was because of this threat that some of the first successful mine protected vehicles were developed by South African military and police forces. Chief amongst these were the Buffel and Casspir armoured personnel carriers and Ratel armoured fighting vehicle. They employed v-shaped hulls that deflected the blast force away from occupants. In most cases occupants survived anti-tank mine detonations with only minor injuries. The vehicles themselves could often be repaired by replacing the wheels or some drive train components that were designed to be modular and replaceable for exactly this reason. Most countries involved in Middle Eastern peace keeping missions deploy modern developments of these vehicles like the RG-31 (Canada, United Arab Emirates, United States) and RG-32 (Sweden).

Awdry and his son, Christopher. In the first 2 books in the series (The Three Railway Engines and Thomas the Tank Engine) he is known as The Fat Director. In the third book (James the Red Engine) he becomes The Fat Controller, as the railway has been nationalised. His full name is revealed in the foreword to the 1951 book Henry the Green Engine. The Fat Controller also appears in the television series Thomas & Friends, adapted from the books. On television he was usually portrayed in the form of a static figure, but has been portrayed using CGI from the twelfth season onward. The name of \\"fat controller\\" has since been adopted in various contexts in the English language, beyond the sphere of the original stories. Origin of nickname The character is first seen in \\"The Sad Story of Henry\\" in the first book in the Railway Series, The Three Railway Engines. When Henry refused to leave a tunnel, the story says \\"a Fat Director who was on the train told the guard to get a rope\\". The character is referred to as the Fat Director/Controller for the remainder of the Railway Series, both in the narrative and by the other characters. The name Sir Topham Hatt is first mentioned in the Foreword to Henry the Green Engine and also appears on his luggage trunk in the same book in the story \\"Percy and the Trousers\\". The first use of the name Sir Topham Hatt in the narrative in the TV series comes in the episode 'The Sad Story of Henry' when Ringo Starr introduces him to the audience. The American version of the television series always refers to him as Sir Topham Hatt, and never as The Fat Controller due to different societal norms between the US and Britain. Biography (Railway Series) There have been three Fat Controllers. This is not revealed directly in the stories, as they all look very similar and are all known as Sir Topham Hatt. However, the books The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways (written by Rev. W. Awdry and George Awdry) and Sodor: Reading Between the Lines (by Christopher Awdry) make this clear. =Sir Topham Hatt, 1st Baronet (1880-1956)= He was a talented engineer who was apprenticed with Sir William Stanier at the Great Western Railway's Swindon works, which gave him a great love of all things Great Western. He went on to assist A. W. Dry in the construction of the Tidmouth, Knapford and Elsbridge Light Railway, which became the branch line, and designed the locomotives that ran upon it. When the standard gauge railways of the Island were merged into the North Western Railway in 1914, Topham Hatt was called upon for his engineering skill. He constructed a bridge to link Sodor with the Mainland, as well as a number of branch lines and improvements to locomotive facilities. He was immediately made a Director of the railway. Topham married Jane Brown and fathered a son (Charles Topham Hatt) and a daughter (Barbara Jane Hatt). Jane was sister to Sir Handel Brown, Liberal MP for Sodor East and owner of the Skarloey Railway, making all successive descendants of the two railway families cousins. Charles wed Amanda Croarie, daughter of the owner of the Ffarquhar Quarry Company, and Barbara married Henry Regaby, the Viscount Harwick. In light of this, Topham's family unit can be seen as an alliance of several of the most prominent families in Sodor. When the North Western Railway was nationalised and became part of British Railways in 1948, Topham Hatt was made Controller of the railway. 1948 also saw him made a baronet for his services to the railways of Sodor. This Fat Controller appears to be the one shown in the series. He appeared in... * The Three Railway Engines ** The Sad Story of Henry ** Edward, Gordon and Henry * Thomas the Tank Engine ** Thomas' Train ** Thomas and the Trucks ** Thomas and the Breakdown Train * James the Red Engine * Tank Engine Thomas Again ** Thomas and the Guard ** Thomas Goes Fishing ** Thomas and Bertie * Troublesome Engines ** Henry and the Elephant ** Tenders and Turntables ** Trouble in the Shed ** Percy Runs Away * Henry the Green Engine ** Coal ** The Flying Kipper ** Gordon's Whistle ** Percy and the Trousers ** Henry's Sneeze * Toby the Tram Engine * Gordon the Big Engine * Edward the Blue Engine ** Saved from Scrap ** Old Iron =Sir Charles Topham Hatt, 2nd Baronet (1914-1997)= Charles Topham Hatt was the son of the first Sir Topham Hatt and the second Controller of the NWR. He too served an apprenticeship with Stanier, this time working under the locomotive designer. Like his father, he was an innovative engineer and made a number of improvements to the railway and its engines. He was also the originator of the scheme to construct the Arlesdale Railway and the ballast consortium that used it. He was responsible for the line's policy of retaining steam locomotives long after they had been abolished on the rest of British Railways, and while Dr Beeching was closing down branch lines on the Mainland, Charles was reopening them on Sodor. He appeared in... *Percy the Small Engine ** Percy and the Signal ** Duck Takes Charge ** Percy's Promise * The Eight Famous Engines ** Percy Takes the Plunge ** Gordon Goes Foreign ** Double Header ** The Fat Controller's Engines * Duck and the Diesel Engine ** Pop Goes the Diesel ** Dirty Work ** A Close Shave * The Twin Engines * Branch Line Engines ** Thomas Comes to Breakfast ** Daisy ** Percy's Predicament * Stepney the \\"Bluebell\\" Engine ** Bluebells of England ** Bowled Out * Main Line Engines ** Buzz, Buzz ** Wrong Road ** Edward's Exploit * Small Railway Engines - Ballast * Enterprising Engines ** Tenders for Henry ** Super Rescue ** Escape ** Little Western * Oliver the Western Engine ** Donald's Duck ** Resource and Sagacity ** Toad Stands By ** Bulgy * Tramway Engines ** Woolly Bear ** Toby's Tightrope * Really Useful Engines ** Stop Thief! ** Fish ** Triple-Header =Sir Stephen Topham Hatt, 3rd Baronet (1941-)= Stephen Topham Hatt was first seen as a child in the book Toby the Tram Engine. As an adult, he was made the third Controller of the North Western Railway. His son, Richard Topham Hatt, is tipped to be the next Fat Controller on Stephen's retirement, and at Stephen's death, he will inherit the family's baronetcy and the title 'Sir Topham Hatt'. He appeared in: * Toby the Tram Engine - Toby and the Stout Gentleman * James and the Diesel Engines ** Old Stuck-Up ** Crossed Lines * More About Thomas the Tank Engine ** Thomas, Percy and the Coal ** The Runaway ** Better Late Than Never * Gordon the High-Speed Engine ** High-Speed Gordon ** Smokescreen ** Fire Escape ** Gordon Proves His Point * Toby, Trucks and Trouble ** Mavis and the Lorry ** Toby's Seaside Holiday ** Bulstrode ** Toby Takes the Road * Thomas and the Twins ** Scrambled Eggs ** Trevor Helps Out * Thomas and the Great Railway Show ** Museum-Piece ** Not the Ticket ** Trouble on the Line ** Thomas and the Railtour * Thomas Comes Home ** Snow Problem ** Washout! ** Thomas Comes Home * Henry and the Express ** Out of Puff ** Overhaul ** Sliding Scales ** Henry Sees Red * Wilbert the Forest Engine ** Percy's Porridge ** Wired-Up * Thomas and the Fat Controller's Engines ** Birdstrike ** Edward and the Cabbages ** Rabbits ** Golden Jubilee * Thomas and Victoria ** Overloaded ** Avalanche ** Toby's Vintage Train * Thomas and his Friends ** Thomas and the Swan ** Buffer Bashing ** Gordon's Fire Service ** Centenary Biography (television series) In the television series, The Fat Controller is always the same man, with the same wife and grandchildren. He is in his mid 60s (as evident in a newspaper article in the Great Discovery), although his voice in the UK versions sometimes hint at old age, and he has even appeared with a white moustache in certain episodes. Very little of his history is revealed, although we do see more of his extended family, including his mother (Dowager Hatt), and his mischievous twin brother (Sir Lowham Hatt). In the first season, he and all the other human characters were made out of lead. From the second season onwards, they were made out of resin so they could move around more easily. He is shown to be a qualified railway engine driver when he brings Percy to the yard for the first time. He is in charge of all the engines on Sodor and seemingly has a great deal of say over other vehicles. As a young man, he learnt to drive in Elizabeth the vintage Sentinel lorry, though in a few episodes, his driving skills are poorly developed, which were used as comedic gags for when the chance arises (often in Winston the Inspection Car). He has overseen the construction of a number of lines, railway services, and has been involved with the opening of several tourist attractions on Sodor. UK Narrator Michael Angelis portrayed the character with a strong Yorkshire accent, with a low gruff voice a trait of which has been continued when Pierce Brosnan briefly took over the mantle, and also when individual voice artists were brought in to voice the characters, The Fat Controller being voiced by Keith Wickham in both the UK and US versions as of 2015 onwards. Kerry Shale initially voiced him in the US prior to 2015, and gave the character a clear American accent and a deep, booming voice. In the American version, he has always been referred to by his actual name, Sir Topham Hatt, possibly because \\"fat\\" is a much more pejorative term in the US than in the UK. The Fat Controller's name was revealed to be Bertram by Alicia Botti, the famous opera singer, in \\"Play Time\\", and by his mother Dowager Hatt in \\"Percy's Parcel\\", \\"Jitters and Japes\\", \\"Edward the Hero\\" and \\"Stop that Bus!\\". Mode of dress In his iconic top hat and morning suit, the Fat Controller looks rather old-fashioned and formal. However, until at least the late 1950s it was customary for railway officials in Britain to be so dressed ‚Äì for Sir Topham Hatt to be dressed any other way would be far more unusual. In the television series, Sir Topham's suit has often been used for comic effect, being augmented with scarf and mittens in winter. The series plays on the outdated nature of this outfit, giving Sir Topham an entire wardrobe of old-fashioned and formal clothes for occasions when he is not \\"on duty\\". In the Series 8 episode \\"Halloween\\", he is shown wearing pyjamas and a nightcap, and in the Series 9 and 10 episodes \\"Flour Power\\" and \\"Sticky Toffee Thomas\\" he is briefly shown wearing a wizard costume. In yet another episode, he is shown wearing a kilt, a gift from a visiting Scottish Lord. In various CGI episodes, he dresses like Santa Claus. Sir Topham's household =Wife: Lady Hatt= Lady Jane Brown Hatt helps her husband run the railway, and is happiest when she sees new lines opened, and has had some special birthday parties. She likes the railway, but had a certain dislike of Annie and Clarabel, calling them beach huts. Later, she took a liking to them, after they got new coats of paint. Although her husband runs a railway, she likes a day out in their car or on a boat.

On this occasion, her Dalmatian dog (soon to be named Gremlin) ran away after being frightened by Gordon's whistle, and ended up in Thomas' cab, where he greatly enjoyed a long ride to the docks. She says the railway is really useful, and the Fat Controller says she is always right.

Stephen loves trains, and was excited when he first met Toby the Tram Engine. Stephen also has a bit of knowledge about the Island, of which is the reason they discovered the Old Castle and the mine (in which Bertram was found). In the Railway Series, Stephen ultimately took the railway over and is the current Fat Controller. In the television series, he has always remained a child. Voices: * Matt Wilkinson (UK; Season 13 only) * Teresa Gallagher (UK; Season 14 onwards / US; Season 19 onwards) * William Hope (US; Season 13 and 14 only) He has appeared in: Granddaughter: Bridget Hatt Bridget Amanda Hatt lives on Sodor, and regularly goes for outings and holidays with her grandparents and brother. On one occasion they went to Toby's old line, where she thought Toby was an electric tram and was reprimanded by her brother for offending him. Her parents (mentioned only in the book Sodor: Reading Between the Lines) are Charles and Amanda Hatt.

Lowham is mischievous and enjoys playing with the children. He seems to know little or nothing about railways. He played hide-and-seek with the children and then went into a signal box and pulled the lever, switching Gordon to the branchline. He dresses exactly like Sir Topham but has a moustache. It is unknown how and why he got his knighthood. He only appears in the series 13 episode, \\"Double Trouble\\". Voices: * Keith Wickham (UK) * Kerry Shale (US) =The Hatt's Butler= Sir Topham Hatt has a butler who is featured in the Railway Series and the Thomas (the Tank Engine) & Friends TV Series. He has appeared in only three stories - \\"Thomas in Trouble/Breaks the Rules\\" in Season 1, \\"Lady Hatt's Birthday Party\\" in Season 5 and \\"Fergus Breaks the Rules / Thomas and the Search for Fergus\\" in Season 7. In real life \\"Day out with Thomas\\" events are a popular way of raising money for heritage railways. These events are an opportunity for children to meet characters from the books and television series (or at least, engines that have been \\"dressed up\\" to resemble them). These events are invariably presided over by a Fat Controller, played by a railway volunteer of appropriate age and build. The copyright holders are strict about how these volunteers should appear: the South Devon Railway's Fat Controller was forced to either quit or shave off his beard,BBC News: Close shave for Fat Controller and it is absolutely forbidden for a Fat Controller to be too thin. In the United States, on the other hand, he is instead portrayed as a costumed character (with the performer's face hidden).

Tabu's performance opened to high critical acclaim; critic Ron Ahluwalia said: \\"Tabu shines in a dark role. The most versatile actress in Bollywood takes to villainy like a second nature. She is menacing and seductive, but keeps an innocent look on her face, making her even viler. The way Tabu delivers her taunts is simply perfect. Her gradual insanity is heart-wrenching and her final outburst is easily the highlight of the film.\\" Another critic said: \\"Tabu is fantastic in a complex role. Her performance in the film is worthy of awards. After Chandni Bar, this is another role that will be remembered for a long, long time.\\" She had a supporting role in Fanaa (2006), alongside Aamir Khan and Kajol.

A lower court charged her with the others under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and the IPC. She had filed a revision petition before a sessions court which discharged her of Section 51 (causing harm to wildlife) of Wildlife Act and both of 147 (punishment for rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly of persons) of the Indian Penal Code. The Rajasthan State Government then filed a revision petition before the Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur which again added Section 149 against her, which had been dropped earlier. In December 2012, the Jodhpur court summoned her along with all the accused for commencement of the trial with the revised charges on 4 February 2013. Although Tabu was acquitted in the blackbuck poaching case on 5 April 2018, the Rajasthan High Court issued her with a notice, challenging her acquittal on 11 March 2019.

The gorge runs south to north through a limestone ridge west of Bristol city centre, and about 3 miles (5 km) from the mouth of the river at Avonmouth. The gorge forms the boundary between the unitary authorities of North Somerset and Bristol, with the boundary running along the south bank. As Bristol was an important port, the gorge formed a defensive gateway to the city. On the east of the gorge is the Bristol suburb of Clifton, and The Downs, a large public park. To the west of the gorge is Leigh Woods, the name of both a village and the National Trust forest it is situated in. There are three Iron Age hill forts overlooking the gorge, as well as an observatory. The Clifton Suspension Bridge, an icon of Bristol, crosses the gorge.  Geology and formation  Portway on the right. The gorge cuts through a ridge mainly of limestone, with some sandstone. This particular ridge runs from Clifton to Clevedon, 10 miles (16 km) away on the Bristol Channel coast, although limestone is found throughout the Bristol area. The fossil shells and corals indicate that the limestone formed in shallow tropical seas in the Carboniferous, 350 million years ago. For a long time it was unclear what caused the Avon to cut through the limestone ridge, rather than run south west through the Ashton Vale towards Weston-super-Mare. However, Bristol was at the southern edge of glaciation during the Anglian ice age, and it has been suggested that ice blocked the river's natural route through Ashton Vale to the west.River Avon Trail, 'Avon Gorge'. Accessed 5 May 2006. At the Clifton Suspension Bridge the Gorge is more than wide and deep. In the 18th century the gorge was quarried to produce building stone for the city. Stone was taken by boat into the floating harbour. In the 19th century celestine was discovered in Leigh Court estate and the Miles family authorised quarrying. Between 1880 and 1920 Bristol was producing 90% of the world's Celestine, but the enterprise did not last long into the 20th century.C.G. Down, 1968. \\"Paradise Bottom.\\" The Industrial Railway Record No. 22 ‚Äì p352-354 Bristol Diamonds, brilliant quartz crystals found in geodes in dolomitic conglomerate in the gorge, were popular souvenirs for visitors to the Hotwells spa in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Quarries on the Bristol side of the gorge are now popular with climbers and are a habitat for Peregrine falcons and other wildlife.  Ecology  Observatory. The steep walls of the gorge support some rare fauna and flora, including species unique to the gorge. There are a total of 24 rare plant species and two unique trees: the Bristol and Wilmotts's whitebeams.BBC Bristol, \\"The Avon Gorge ‚Äì Bristol's Great Glacier?\\" Accessed 5 May 2006. Other notable plants include Bristol rock cress, Bristol onion, spiked speedwell, autumn squill and honewort.Myles (2000), page 161 Because of its steep sides, there are many parts of the gorge on which trees cannot grow, making way for smaller plants. The gorge is also home to rare invertebrate species.Avon Wildlife Trust, \\"The wildlife and habitats of Avon .\\" Accessed 24 March 2009. The gorge has a microclimate around 1 degree warmer than the surrounding land. The steep south-west facing sides receive the afternoon sunlight, but are partially sheltered from the prevailing winds. When winds come from the Bristol Channel in the north west they may be funnelled into the gorge, creating harsh and wet conditions. The steep gorge walls make an ideal habitat for peregrine falcons, with a plentiful supply of food nearby in the form of pigeons and gulls. Peregrines have a history of nesting in the gorge, but having become rare in the British Isles they did not breed and were rarely seen in the gorge after the 1930s. In 1990 Peregrines returned to the gorge, and have successfully bred in most of the following years. On warm days a strong uplift forms in the gorge, on which birds of prey soar while hunting. The gorge also houses large populations of Jackdaw and horseshoe bats, both of which find homes in the caves and bridge buttresses. The Avon Gorge viewed from Ashton Meadow, by Francis Danby 1822 Due to its geology and ecology, an area of of the gorge and surrounding woodland has been protected as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the original notification taking place in 1952. The site may in future be protected as a Special Area of Conservation under the European Commission Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). The Leigh Woods side of the gorge is largely owned by the National Trust. The Downs on the city side of the gorge are owned by Bristol City Council and managed as a large public park. The gorge side is protected in partnership with Bristol Zoo, WWF and English Nature. The council's management of the gorge involves balancing the need to protect its ecology with recreational uses such as rock climbing. Green-flowered helleborine is found on the western side of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.Myles (2000) page 249 lady orchid was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley on the west side of the Gorge; there is some doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction.Myles (2000) page 251 fly orchid and bee orchid are found in the gorge, along with their hybrid.Myles (2000) page 252 A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge.Myles (2000) page 68 Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods.Myles (2000), page 101 Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge.Myles (2000), page 102 Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native.Myles (2000), page 155 Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge.Myles (2000), page 156 Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.Myles (2000), page 186  History of human use  The Portishead Railway runs through a short tunnel under the bridge buttress. The gorge area was inhabited at least as early as the Iron Age, probably by the Dobunni tribe. In Leigh Woods above Nightingale Valley, a steep dry valley beside the suspension bridge, is Stokeleigh Camp, one of three Iron Age hill forts in the area. Stokeleigh was occupied from 3BC to 1AD, and was also used in the Middle Ages. The camp was protected on two sides by the cliff faces of the gorge and Nightingale Valley, and was also protected by earthworks, and is now a scheduled ancient monument. A second hill fort was situated across Nightingale Valley, but has since been built on, and bridge road cuts through it. The third hill fort was situated on the opposite side of the gorge, in what is now observatory green. Archaeology, plus the configuration of the three forts, suggest they played a role in defending the gorge. Avon Gorge and Clifton Suspension Bridge, looking towards the city of Bristol. The people are looking out of the Giants Cave view point on the gorge face. During the Middle Ages and industrial revolution the area which now forms The Downs was used as common grazing land. It was mined for lead, calamine, iron and limestone, and became home to a windmill which produced snuff from the tobacco which had become one of the city's principal imports. In 1777 the windmill burnt out in a storm, and the building was converted into the observatory, which houses a camera obscura. In the 18th and 19th centuries Bristol's economy boomed and Clifton became a desirable place to live. Mansion houses were built overlooking the gorge, but after grazing was stopped, trees grew and obscured the view from these mansions. In the Victorian era, with houses creeping further onto the Downs, an Act of Parliament was passed to protect them as a park for the people of Bristol. In 1754 a bridge to span the gorge was proposed, but it was nearly 80 years before work began on Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, and a further 30 years before it was completed.Vaughan, Adrian: Isambard Kingdom Brunel ‚Äî Engineering Knight Errant, John Murray, 1991, .Beckett (1980). Chapter 6: \\"Bridges\\". Today the bridge is perhaps the best known landmark in Bristol. Throughout Bristol's history the gorge has been an important transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. It is the gateway to Bristol Harbour, and provided protection against storms or attack. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner Gipsy in 1878, the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City. The phrase \\"ship shape and Bristol fashion\\" arises from when the main harbour in Bristol was tidal, the bottom of which was rocky. If ships were not of stout construction then they would simply break up as the tide receded, hence the phrase.Ship-shape and Bristol fashion on www.phrases.org.uk (retrieved 20 August 2007) A railway, the Bristol Port Railway, was built through the gorge on the east side from Hotwells to Avonmouth between 1863 and 1865. The Portishead Railway was opened on the west side in 1867. The section of the Bristol Port Railway between Hotwells and Sneyd Park junction was closed in 1922, when construction of a major road through the gorge, the Portway, was started. The Portway was opened in 1926. The road is now part of the A4 road, linking Bristol city centre to the M5 motorway, which bypasses the city near Avonmouth. Two railways still run through the gorge. On the east side the Severn Beach Line to Avonmouth and Severn Beach uses the remaining part of the Bristol Port Railway through part of the gorge, and through a tunnel under the Downs. On the west side the Portishead Railway was closed by the Beeching Axe in the 1960s, but has since been reopened for freight traffic as far as Royal Portbury Dock, 2.5 miles (4 km) downstream,Portishead Railway Group, 2006. \\"History of the Portishead Railway .\\" Accessed 15 April 2006 and funding is now in place to reopen the rest of the line and reintroduce passenger services to Portishead. Between 1893 and 1934, the Clifton Rocks Railway linked the passenger steamer pier at Hotwells with Clifton on the rim of the gorge. A footpath and National Cycle Network cycleway run alongside the Portishead Railway and along the old towpath. The gorge's proximity to the urban population of Bristol made it a popular venue for rock climbing from the 1940s ‚Äì a time when most UK climbing was centred in mountain areas. The first guide to climbing routes in Avon Gorge was published in 1955 by the University of Bristol Mountaineering Club. The same year, British mountaineer Chris Bonington climbed Main Wall putting up Mercavity. The 2017 edition of The Climbers' Club Guide to Avon Gorge by Martin Crocker lists 400 pages of routes and guidance. Avon Gorge is often criticised as being so over-climbed many of the routes are \\"polished\\".  Mythology  Sculpture of Goram the Giant in the grounds of Ashton Court The formation of the Avon Gorge is the subject of mediaeval mythology. The myths tell tales of two giant brothers, Goram and Vincent, who constructed the gorge. One variation holds that Vincent and Goram were constructing the gorge together and Goram fell asleep, to be accidentally killed by Vincent's pickaxe. Another variation tells of the brothers falling for Avona, a girl from Wiltshire, who instructs the giants to drain a lake which stretches from Rownham Hill to Bradford-on-Avon (i.e. the Avon valley). Goram began digging the nearby Hazel Brook Gorge in Blaise Castle estate, but consumed too much beer and fell asleep. Vincent dug the Avon Gorge and drained the lake, winning the affection of Avona. Upon waking Goram stamped his foot, creating \\"The Giant's Footprint\\" in the Blaise Castle estate, and threw himself into the Bristol Channel, turning to stone and leaving his head and shoulder above water as the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm.Eugene Byrne & Simon Gurr, 2002. \\"Bristol Myths and Legends.\\" Bristol 2008: St Vincent's Rock.

It is the largest HBCU in Louisiana, a member-school of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the flagship institution of the Southern University System. Its campus encompasses 512 acres, with an agricultural experimental station on an additional 372-acre site, five miles north of the main campus on Scott's Bluff overlooking the Mississippi River in the northern section of Baton Rouge. Southern University's 13 intercollegiate athletics teams are known as the Jaguars, and are members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) in NCAA Division I. The Human Jukebox is a well known collegiate marching band that has been representing the university since 1947. History President William McKinley speaks at Southern University in New Orleans, 1901. At the 1879 Louisiana State Constitutional Convention, African- American political leaders P.B.S. Pinchback, Theophile T. Allain and Henry Demas proposed founding a higher education institution \\"for the education of persons of color.\\" Louisiana before the American Civil War had an established class of free people of color, who were often property owners and educated; they kept that tradition for their children. In 1880, the Louisiana General Assembly chartered what was then called Southern University for Colored Students, originally located in New Orleans. Southern opened its doors on with 12 students. The school was held for a time at the former Israel Sinai Temple on Calliope Street, between St. Charles and Camp streets. In 1890, the legislature designated Southern as a land grant college for blacks, in order to continue to satisfy federal requirements under the land grant program to support higher education for all students in the state, despite having a segregated system. It established an Agricultural and Mechanical department. The 1904 \\"Picayune Guide to New Orleans\\" described the University, then on the 5100 block of Magazine Street in Uptown New Orleans, as \\"for the education of colored persons. Coeducation is in force here. The school is excellent and the instruction of an advanced character.\\" Because of continued growth and a lack of land for expansion, in 1914 the university moved to Scotlandville, along Scott's Bluff facing the Mississippi River and north of Baton Rouge. Now absorbed into the capital, this area is included as a historic destination of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. The first president of what is now known as Southern University at Baton Rouge was Dr. Joseph Samuel Clark. Clark, an African-American leader from Baton Rouge. He had led Baton Rouge College and the Louisiana Colored Teachers Association. In 1921, the Louisiana Constitutional Convention authorized the reorganization and expansion of Southern University; Legislative Act 100 of 1922 provided that the institution be reorganized under the control of the State Board of Education. Clark presided over Southern University during its resulting expansion. Student enrollment grew from 47 to 500, and two of the school's early buildings were built during this time. The Southern University Laboratory School System began operating in September 1922. The Laboratory School was first accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in 1936 and has conferred more than 5,000 high school diplomas since its inception. Clark presided until his retirement in 1938. Clark's son Dr. Felton Grandison Clark was appointed as president that year. He had been serving as a dean at Southern since 1934. The State School for the Negro Deaf and Blind was established here in 1938, under supervision of Southern University. In 1943, the university was visited by the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. F. G. Clark generated much more expansion of the university: 33 of 114 current buildings were erected during his 30 years of tenure. The student enrollment grew from 500 to nearly 10,000 students by the end of his tenure. Under segregated state education, LSU Law School had refused to admit Charles J. Hatfield, III, an African American college graduate who filed a lawsuit in 1946 to gain professional education in the state. A special Louisiana Convention established a law program in 1947 at Southern University; it is now known as the Southern University Law Center. F. G. Clark expanded affiliated centers for Southern University, founding Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO) (1956) and Southern University at Shreveport (SUSLA) (1964). They were officially incorporated by the legislature into the Southern University System in 1974. In 1969, Clark retired and Dr. G. Leon Netterville was selected as president. On November 16, 1972, in a second day of protests as students argued to be included in determining administration policies and decisions, Denver Smith and Leonard Brown were shot during a protest outside the Old Auditorium (now the Southern University Museum of Art). The murders have never been solved, but the students were killed with buckshot, which the sheriff's deputies were using. These two students were involved with \\"Students United,\\" a student activist group. The governor and sheriff's office denied that their people were responsible for the deaths. Governor Edwin Edwards ordered the campus temporarily closed, and it was patrolled by troops to keep the peace.\\"November 16, 1972: The Southern University Massacre Occurs\\", Black Then website, 2017 The institution continued to grow. In 1974, a special session in the Louisiana Legislature established the Southern University System, with Jesse N. Stone of Shreveport as its president. The system consists of Southern University and A&M; College, Baton Rouge (SUBR); Southern University, New Orleans (SUNO); Southern University Law Center (SULC); Southern University Agricultural Center (SUAC); and Southern University, Shreveport (SUSLA). SUSLA is a two-year, commuter college. The Southern University Museum of Art at Shreveport has been designated as a destination of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. In 1978, the legislature merged the Southern School for the Deaf with the Louisiana School for the Deaf, moving the students temporarily into the Mayflower North Campus, during construction of the new South Campus. In 1985, they entered the new buildings in the South. Between 1970 and 1990, the university consistently enrolled over 10,000 students and secured the title of being the largest HBCU in the nation. Between 2004 and 2013, Southern University ranked 4th in the nation for baccalaureate-origin institution of black male doctorate recipients.

Legacy of Lacumba This sign remains near Lacumba's campus home Southern University was the first HBCU to house a live mascot on campus. Henry J. Bellaire, alumnus and president of the 1961 senior class, and alumna Helen Williams presented a baby jaguar as a gift to the university. The jaguar was named Lacumba (meaning \\"Heart of Africa\\") and was born on May 26, 1971. In 1991, Lacumba retired to the Acadiana Zoo in Broussard, LA and was replaced with Lacumba II. Lacumba II (commonly referred to as simply Lacumba) was born on May 12, 1991, the offspring of two rare black jaguars bred in hopes of producing a black jaguar. However, Lacumba II was born brown; it grew to be 200 pounds. Lacumba II died of natural causes at the age of 15 in December 2004 and was the last jaguar to live on campus. Animal rights advocates dissuaded the university from purchasing a new jaguar. The jaguar pen remains in front of the A.W. Mumford football stadium off Harding Boulevard. The legacy of Lacumba lives on through the school's costumed jaguar mascot.

She was the first indigenous African to win Miss World. Early life Abonnema-native Darego was born in Lagos to a family as the sixth of eight children. At age two, her family relocated to Port Harcourt where she was raised in D-Line. Darego attended Bereton Montessori Nursery and Primary School, and at ten was sent to boarding school in a bid to shield her from her mother who had become very ill with breast cancer. Her mother, Inaewo, owned a rice trading business and a clothing boutique, but died two years after her daughter's move to boarding school. Darego has spoken of how the loss prepared her for tough challenges in the future. As a teenager, Darego longed to be a model, and auditioned for the M-Net Face of Africa modelling competition despite her conservative father's wishes, but was not chosen as a finalist. Darego attended Federal Government Girls' College, Abuloma. Upon completing her secondary education she attended University of Port Harcourt where she studied Computer Science and Mathematics.I Wear What Fits Pageantry In 2001, Darego was crowned Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria. Contrary to popular belief, Darego did not replace Valerie Peterside after the latter was dethroned as she had competed in rival pageant Miss Nigeria. A few months later she was a contestant at Miss Universe, and became the first Nigerian to place among the top 10 semi- finalists, finishing seventh overall. She was the only top ten contestant to wear a modest maillot as opposed to a revealing bikini during the swimsuit competition.Glamour queens In November that year, she became the first indigenous African to claim the Miss World title (Past African winners Penelope Coelen and Anneline Kriel from South Africa, are of European descent, and Antigone Costanda, who represented Egypt in 1954 is of Greek heritage). Darego's victory was widely welcomed in her home country, and her one-year tenure included goodwill trips and scheduled appearances on behalf of the pageant, and a national honour of MFR. Modelling Prior to winning MBGN, Darego featured in print commercials for boutique chain Collectables, and following her stint at Miss Universe was invited by Naomi Campbell to participate in Frock 'n' Roll - a charity fashion show in Barcelona, soon negotiating a modelling deal with Trump Model Management in America.Anne Titilope now Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria Shortly after her reign as Miss World she was represented by the London and Paris branches of Next Model Management and landed a three-year contract with L'Or√©al, becoming only the second Black model to accomplish this feat after Vanessa Williams, and was photographed by Annie Leibovitz, a big name in Americans portrait photograph sphere for Vogue. Other brands she has modelled for include Avon, Christian Dior, Sephora, Target, and Macy‚Äôs. Darego has also appeared in Elle, Marie Claire, Allure, Trace, Stitch, Cosmopolitan, and Essence magazines, working with numerous designers including Oscar de la Renta, Marc Bouwer, Tommy Hillfiger, Ralph Lauren, and Gianfranco Ferre. In her homeland Darego has appeared in advertising campaigns for hair care brand Gentle Touch with model Oluchi, and served as the face of Arik Air.Agbani Darego Becomes Arik‚Äôs Brand Ambassador She has also graced the covers of Complete Fashion, Mania, ThisDay Style, Genevieve, True Love, and TW Magazine.

Personal life In the aftermath of her win in 2001, Darego was awarded an honorary chieftaincy by the Council of Chiefs of Lagos. At the time of her investiture, she was one of the youngest chiefs in the country. Due to her busy work schedule, Darego left the University of Port Harcourt, but after moving to New York where she was signed to Next Model Management, Ford Models, and Trump Models, she enrolled with New York University to study Psychology, graduating in May 2012. In April 2017, Darego married her longtime partner Ishaya Danjuma, son of billionaire General Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma, in a ceremony held in Marrakesh. Together, they have a son who was born in September 2018.

This representation is allowed by the Chinese remainder theorem, which asserts that, if is the product of the moduli, there is, in an interval of length , exactly one integer having any given set of modular values. The arithmetic of a residue numeral system is also called multi-modular arithmetic. Multi- modular arithmetic is widely used for computation with large integers, typically in linear algebra, because it provides faster computation than with the usual numeral systems, even when the time for converting between numeral systems is taken into account. Other applications of multi-modular arithmetic include polynomial greatest common divisor, Gr√∂bner basis computation and cryptography. Definition A residue numeral system is defined by a set of integers :\\\\\\\\{ m_1, m_2, m_3,\\\\ldots, m_k\\\\\\\\}, called the moduli, which are generally supposed to be pairwise coprime (that is, any two of them have a greatest common divisor equal to one). Residue number systems have been defined for non-coprime moduli, but are not commonly used because of worse properties. Therefore, they will not be considered in the remainder of this article.Behrooz Parhami, Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware Design. 2nd edition, Oxford University Press, New York, 2010. 641+xxv p. . An integer is represented in the residue numeral system by the set of its remainders :\\\\\\\\{ x_1,x_2,x_3,\\\\ldots,x_k \\\\\\\\} under Euclidean division by the moduli. That is : x_i = x \\\\operatorname{mod}m_i, and :0\\\\le x_i for every Let be the product of all the m_i. Two integers whose difference is a multiple of have the same representation in the residue numeral system defined by the s. More precisely, the Chinese remainder theorem asserts that each of the different sets of possible residues represents exactly one residue class modulo . That is, each set of residues represents exactly one integer in the interval . In applications where one is also interested with negative integers, it is often more convenient to represent integers belonging to an interval centered at 0. In this case, if is odd, each set of residues represents exactly one integer of absolute value at most \\\\frac{M}{2}. Arithmetic operations For adding, subtracting and multiplying numbers represented in a residue number system, it suffices to perform the same modular operation on each pair of residues. More precisely, if :[m_1, \\\\ldots, m_k] is the list of moduli, the sum of the integers and , respectively represented by the residues [x_1,\\\\ldots, x_k] and [y_1,\\\\ldots, y_k], is the integer represented by [z_1,\\\\ldots, z_k], such that :z_i= (x_i+y_i)\\\\operatorname{mod} m_i, for (as usual, mod denotes the modulo operation consisting of taking the remainder of the Euclidean division by the right operand). Subtraction and multiplication are defined similarly. For a succession of operations, it is not necessary to apply the modulo operation at each step. It may be applied at the end of the computation, or, during the computation, for avoiding overflow of hardware operations. =Comparison= If two integers are equal, then all their residues are equal. Conversely, if all residues are equal, then the two integers are equal, or their differences is a multiple of . It follows that testing equality is easy. At the opposite, testing inequalities () is difficult and, usually, requires to convert integers to the standard representation. As a consequence, this representation of numbers is not suitable for algorithms using inequality tests, such Euclidean division and Euclidean algorithm. =Division= Division in residue numeral systems is problematic. A paper describing one possible algorithm is available at . On the other hand, if B is coprime with M (that is b_i ot =0) then :C=A\\\\cdot B^{-1} \\\\mod M can be easily calculated by :c_i=a_i \\\\cdot b_i^{-1} \\\\mod m_i, where B^{-1} is multiplicative inverse of B modulo M, and b_i^{-1} is multiplicative inverse of b_i modulo m_i. Applications RNS have applications in the field of digital computer arithmetic. By decomposing in this a large integer into a set of smaller integers, a large calculation can be performed as a series of smaller calculations that can be performed independently and in parallel.

Traditional music  Traditional music (known in Bislama as kastom singsing or kastom tanis) is still thriving in the rural areas of Vanuatu. Musical instruments consist mostly of idiophones: drums of various shape and size, slit gongs, as well as rattles, among others. In various regions, aerophones, such as conch shells, whistles or bamboo flutes, are (or used to be) played. Membranophones and chordophones were also found in some areas, but have fallen into disuse during colonial times. The large slit gongs which symbolize Vanuatu belong to these traditional instruments; they were most often used as musical drums to accompany certain dances, but also sometimes ‚Äì though seldom ‚Äì as a ritual means of communication; although widespread throughout Vanuatu, they are used vertically only in central areas of the archipelago (mainly on Ambrym). So- called traditional music is actually a very general cover term encompassing a wide and complex variety of musical genres known by every local community ‚Äì in a way very similar to the vague term classical music of Western societies.  String bands  Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as string band music. It combines guitars, ukulele, and popular songs.  Urban music  More recently the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s. The early part of that decade saw bands like Huarere and Tropic Tempo forge a distinctly ni-Vanuatu modern musical identity, and more bands have followed in their footsteps, including XX-Squad and Vanessa Quai. Popular genres of commercial music, which are currently being played in town, include African new wave, Reggae, zouk music and reggaeton. African Zouk, Reggae and Reggaeton, a variation of hip-hop rapped in Spanish, played alongside its own distinctive beat, is especially played in the local nightclubs of Vanuatu with, mostly, an audience of Westerners and tourists.Reggae is also becoming the Nations favorite and the local upcoming reggae stars are not limited to Naio Band, Stan and The Earthforce band, Tujah, Smol Fyah and Metoxcide!

Mugu Rock Mugu Rock, seen from the northwest Mugu Rock is a distinctive feature of the coastal headland promontory that has been featured in many film shoots and television commercials. This igneous dike marks the western end of the Santa Monica Mountains, and the Rancho Guadalasca boundary. The rock was formed when the roadway was cut through the near- vertical ridge of resistant volcanic rock in 1937. A route had been blasted out around the promontory in 1923‚Äì24 to complete Pacific Coast Highway between Malibu and the Oxnard Plain. This replaced a narrow path around the rock and much of that roadway has since eroded away. The site is a popular but dangerous place for fishing, sightseeing, cliff diving, and rock climbing up the sheer sides of the rock.

These are all remote controlled so that live weapons can be used. The range offers the HSMST, QST, FACT, and MST. These are capable of testing weapons that are air launched and also ones from land. = San Nicolas Island = The island is used as live munitions testing range. It supplies a realistic marine environment, Remote and Fixed telemetry sites, 50,000 pound missile rail( located at 33.264278,-119.539), target launcher, Inert Missile impact area, 10,000 foot airfield for c-5 and c-17 and dedicated ordnance and range staff. This gives them the ability to launch and control a wide variety of missiles, aerial and surface targets from a controlled secluded island. It was also one of the 8 candidates for the first detonation of the atomic bomb before White Sands Proving ground was selected for it. During WW2 there were stationed aircraft on the island Including j4f Widgeon Amphibians and TBF Avengers. In 1946 the Island became strictly used as an auxiliary landing field for the island. The island is now used for mostly target acquisition and live training for the US navy. They have continued to upgrade the island with new telemetry radar facilities. = Electronic targets = The range is capable of simulated GPS, radar and Active Denial Systems for weapons-survivability testing. This is used for testing of anti-radar and anti-GPS targets.

Its current name literally means \\"Old customs\\", named so after Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) had been included in Romania in 1913. In 1940, however, that region was transferred to Bulgaria, and the village has since lain once again near the border, but the name stuck. Even in Communist Romania, Vama Veche had the reputation of a non-mainstream tourist destination, which has only grown since the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the communist era, concern for border patrol sight lines spared Vama Veche the development that occurred in other Romanian Black Sea resorts. It became a hangout for intellectuals during the '70s when students and professors coming from the University Babe»ô-Bolyai of Cluj Napoca used to spend their summers here; Accommodations consisted of tents or rooms rented from peasants or fishermen. In the summer of 1988 the wife of dictator Nicolae Ceau»ôescu (Elena Ceau»ôescu), discovered the village when heading to Bulgaria and decided to demolish it as it appeared to her poor and inesthetic. Some of the houses, a school and a church were destroyed, but thanks to the '89 Romanian Revolution, the village escaped from the complete demolition.

The earliest needles were made of bone or wood; modern needles are manufactured from high carbon steel wire and are nickel- or 18K gold-plated for corrosion resistance. High quality embroidery needles are plated with two-thirds platinum and one- third titanium alloy. Traditionally, needles have been kept in needle books or needlecases which have become objects of adornment. Sewing needles may also be kept in an √©tui, a small box that held needles and other items such as scissors, pencils and tweezers. Types of hand sewing needles Needles used for hand sewing Thread through the eye of a No.5 sharp needle Hand sewing needles come in a variety of types/ classes designed according to their intended use and in a variety of sizes within each type.http://www.sewing.org/files/guidelines/22_110_hand_sewing_needle_guide.pdf *Sharp Needles: used for general hand sewing; built with a sharp point, a round eye, and are of medium length. Those with a double-eyes are able to carry two strands of thread while minimizing fabric friction. *Appliqu√©: These are considered another all-purpose needle for sewing, appliqu√©, and patch work. *Embroidery: Also known as crewel needles; identical to sharps but have a longer eye to enable easier threading of multiple embroidery threads and thicker yarns. *Betweens or Quilting: These needles are shorter than sharps, with a small rounded eye and are used for making fine stitches on heavy fabrics such as in tailoring, quilt making and other detailed handwork; note that some manufacturers also distinguish between quilting needles and quilting between needles, the latter being slightly shorter and narrower than the former. *Milliners: A class of needles generally longer than sharps, useful for basting and pleating, normally used in millinery work. *Easy- or Self- threading: Also called calyx-eyed sharps, side threading, and spiral eye needles, these needles have an open slot into which a thread may easily be guided rather than the usual closed eye design. *Beading: These needles are very fine, with a narrow eye to enable them to fit through the centre of beads and sequins along with a long shaft to thread and hold a number of beads at a time. *Bodkin: Also called ballpoints, this is a long, thick needle with a ballpoint end and a large, elongated eye. They can be flat or round and are generally used for threading elastic, ribbon or tape through casings and lace openings. *Chenille: These are similar to tapestry needles but with large, long eyes and a very sharp point to penetrate closely woven fabrics. Useful for ribbon embroidery. *Darning: Sometimes called finishing needles, these are designed with a blunt tip and large eye making them similar to tapestry needles but longer; yarn darners are the heaviest sub-variety. *Doll: Not designed for hand sewing at all, these needles are made long and thin and are used for soft sculpturing on dolls, particularly facial details. *Leather: Also known as glovers and as wedge needles, these have a triangular point designed to pierce leather without tearing it; often used on leather-like materials such as vinyl and plastic. *Sailmaker: Similar to leather needles, but the triangular point extends further up the shaft; designed for sewing thick canvas or heavy leather. *Tapestry: The large eye on these needles lets them to carry a heavier weight yarn than other needles, and their blunt tip‚Äîusually bent at a slight angle from the rest of the needle‚Äîallows them to pass through loosely woven fabric such as embroidery canvas or even-weave material without catching or tearing it; comes in a double-eyed version for use on a mounted frame and with two colors of thread. *Tatting: These are built long with an even thickness for their entire length, including at the eye, to enable thread to be pulled through the double stitches used in tatting. *Upholstery: These needles are heavy, long needles that may be straight or curved and are used for sewing heavy fabrics, upholstery work, tufting and for tying quilts; the curved variety is practical for difficult situations on furniture where a straight needle will not work Heavy duty 12\\" needles are used for repairing mattresses. Straight sizes: 3\\"-12\\" long, curved: 1.5\\"-6\\" long. Needle size Needle size is denoted by one or more numbers on the manufacturer's packet. The general convention for sizing of needles, like that of wire gauges, is that within any given class of needle the length and thickness of a needle increases as the size number decreases. For example, a size 9 needle will be thicker and longer than a size 12 needle. However, the needle sizes are not standardized and so a size 10 of one class may be (and in some cases actually is) either thinner or finer than a size 12 of another type. Where a packet contains a needle count followed by two size numbers such as \\"20 Sharps 5/10\\" the second set of numbers correspond to the range of sizes of needle within the packet, in this case typically ten sharps needles of size 5 and ten of size 10 (for a total of 20 needles). As another example, a packet labeled \\"16 Milliners 3/9\\" would contain 16 milliners needles ranging in sizes from 3 to 9. History =Prehistoric sewing needles= Magdalenian, Gourdan-Polignan France - Mus√©um of Toulouse The first form of sewing was probably tying together animal skins using thorns and sharpened rocks as needles, with animal sinew or plant material as thread. The early limitation was the ability to produce a small enough hole in a needle matrix, such as a bone sliver, not to damage the material. Traces of this survive in the use of awls to make eyelet holes in fabric by separating rather than cutting the threads. A point that might be from a bone needle dates to 61,000 years ago and was discovered in Sibudu Cave, South Africa. A needle made from bird bone and attributed to archaic humans, the Denisovans, estimated to be around 50,000 years-old, and was found in Denisova Cave. A bone needle, dated to the Aurignacian age (47000 to 41,000 years ago), was discovered in Potok Cave () in the Eastern Karavanke, Slovenia. Bone and ivory needles found in the Xiaogushan prehistoric site in Liaoning province date between 30,000 and 23,000 years old. Ivory needles were also found dated to 30,000 years ago at the Kostenki site in Russia.Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles, University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002 8,600-year-old Neolithic needle bones were discovered at Ek≈üi H√∂y√ºk, western Anatolia, in present-day Denizli Province. Flinders Petrie found copper sewing needles at Naqada, Egypt, ranging from 4400 BC to 3000 BC. Iron sewing needles were found at the Oppidum of Manching, dating to the third century BC. =Ancient sewing needles= Tibetan needle-case A form of needle lace named n√•lebinding seems to generally predate knitting and crochet by thousands of years, partly because it can use far shorter rough-graded threads than knitting does. Native Americans were known to use sewing needles from natural sources. One such source, the agave plant, provided both the needle and the \\"thread.\\" The agave leaf would be soaked for an extended period of time, leaving a pulp, long, stringy fibres and a sharp tip connecting the ends of the fibres. The \\"needle\\" is essentially what was the tip end of the leaf. Once the fibres dried, the fibres and \\"needle\\" could then be used to sew items together. Sewing needles are an application of wire-making technology, which started to appear in the second millennium B.C. Some fine examples of Bronze Age gold torques are made of very consistent gold wire, which is more malleable than bronze. However, copper and bronze needles do not need to be as long: the eye can be made by turning the wire back on itself and redrawing it through the die. =Later sewing needles= Metal container for pins from the second half of the 20th century. From the Museo del Objeto del Objeto collection The next major break- through in needle-making was the arrival of high-quality steel-making technology from China in the tenth century, principally in Spain in the form of the Catalan furnace, which soon extended to produce reasonably high quality steel in significant volumes. This technology later extended to Germany and France, although not significantly in England. England began creating needles in 1639 at Redditch, creating the drawn-wire technique still in common use today. About 1655, needle manufacturers were sufficiently independent to establish a Guild of Needlemakers in London, although Redditch remained the principal place of manufacture. In Japan, Hari-Kuyo, the Festival of Broken Needles, dates back to the 1600s.

First, it can refer to something of, relating to, or involving, an elegy or something that expresses similar mournfulness or sorrow. Second, it can refer more specifically to poetry composed in the form of elegiac couplets. An elegiac couplet consists of one line of poetry in dactylic hexameter followed by a line in dactylic pentameter. Because dactylic hexameter is used throughout epic poetry, and because the elegiac form was always considered \\"lower style\\" than epic, elegists, or poets who wrote elegies, frequently wrote with epic poetry in mind and positioned themselves in relation to epic. Classical poets The first examples of elegiac poetry in writing come from classical Greece. The form dates back nearly as early as epic, with such authors as Archilocus and Simonides of Ceos from early in the history of Greece. The first great elegiac poet of the Hellenistic period was Philitas of Cos: Augustan poets identified his name with great elegiac writing. One of the most influential elegiac writers was Philitas' rival Callimachus, who had an enormous impact on Roman poets, both elegists and non-elegists alike. He promulgated the idea that elegy, shorter and more compact than epic, could be even more beautiful and worthy of appreciation. Propertius linked him to his rival with the following well-known couplet: The 1st-century-AD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas second only to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Another Greek elegiac poet, the subject of an elegy by Callimachus, was Heraclitus of Halicarnassus.Greek Anthology Book 7, 7.80Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Philosophers, 9.17 Hermesianax was also an elegiac poet. The foremost elegiac writers of the Roman era were Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid. Catullus, a generation earlier than the other three, influenced his younger counterparts greatly. They all, particularly Propertius, drew influence from Callimachus, and they also clearly read each other and responded to each other's works. Notably, Catullus and Ovid wrote in non-elegiac meters as well, but Propertius and Tibullus did not. English poets The \\"elegy\\" was originally a classical form with few English examples. However, in 1751, Thomas Gray wrote \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\". That poem inspired numerous imitators, and soon both the revived Pindaric ode and \\"elegy\\" were commonplace. Gray used the term elegy for a poem of solitude and mourning, and not just for funereal (eulogy) verse. He also freed the elegy from the classical elegiac meter. Afterward, Samuel Taylor Coleridge argued that the elegiac is the form \\"most natural to the reflective mind\\" and that it may be upon any subject, so long as it reflects on the poet himself. Coleridge was quite aware that his definition conflated the elegiac with the lyric, but he was emphasizing the recollected and reflective nature of the lyric he favored and referring to the sort of elegy that had been popularized by Gray. Also, Charlotte Smith used the term to describe her series of Elegiac Sonnets. Similarly, William Wordsworth had said that poetry should come from \\"emotions recollected in tranquility\\" (Preface to Lyrical Ballads, emphasis added). After the Romantics, \\"elegiac\\" slowly returned to its narrower meaning of verse composed in memory of the dead. In other examples of poetry such as Alfred Tennyson's \\"The Lady of Shalott\\", an elegiac tone can be used, where the author is praising someone in a sombre tone. J. R. R. Tolkien in his essay \\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\" argues that Beowulf is a heroic elegy.

The country is best known for malouf, a kind of music imported from Andalusia after the Spanish immigration in the 15th century. Though in its modern form, malouf is likely very dissimilar to any music played more than four centuries ago, it does have its roots in Spain and Portugal, and is closely related to genres with a similar history throughout North Africa, including malouf's Libyan cousin, Algerian gharnati and Moroccan ala or Andalusi. During the Ottoman era, malouf was influenced by Turkish music. However, Tunisian repertoires, styles and also instruments remain distinctive ‚Äì the  ª≈´d t≈´nsƒ´ is an emblematic case. This is a close relative of the 'uds associated with Algeria and also Morocco.See also https://oudmigrations.com/2017/05/28/a-tunisian-musical-icon/ 20th century musicians from Tunisia include Anouar Brahem, an oud player, Jasser Haj Youssef, a composer and a violin player, and El Azifet, a rare all-female orchestra, as well as well-known vocalist Raoul Journo, singer and oud player Dhafer Youssef, singer, guitarist and lutenist Nabil Khemir, Lotfi Bouchnak, Khemais Tarnane, Saliha, Saleh Mehdi, Ali Riahi, Hedi Jouini, Fethia Khairi, Cheikh El Afrit, Oulaya and Na√¢ma.

(see Tunisian underground music) Modern music festivals in Tunisia include Tabarka Jazz Festival, Testour's Arab Andalusian Music Festival and the Sahara Festival in Douz. Malouf Malouf is played by small orchestras, consisting of violins, drums, sitars and flutes. Modern malouf has some elements of Berber music in the rhythms, but is seen as a successor to the cultural heights reached by Muslim Andalusia. Malouf has been called \\"an emblem of (Tunisian) national identity\\" . Nevertheless, malouf can not compete commercially with popular music, much of it Egyptian, and it has only survived because of the efforts of the Tunisian government and a number of private individuals. Malouf is still performed in public, especially at weddings and circumcision ceremonies, though recordings are relatively rare. The term malouf translates as familiar or customary. Baron Rodolphe d'Erlanger is an important figure of modern Tunisian music. He collected the rules and history of malouf, which filled six volumes, and set up The Rachidia, an important conservatory which is still in use. =Structure= Malouf is based on qasidah, a kind of classical Arabic poetry, and comes in many forms, including the post-classical muwashshah, which abandons many of qasidah's rules, shgul, a very traditional form, and zajal, a modern genre with a unique format. The most important structural element of malouf, however, is the nuba, a two-part suite in a single maqam (an Arab mode organized by quarter-tones), which lasts about an hour. A nuba is a musical form introduced to North Africa with the migration of Muslim inhabitants of Spain in the 13 and 14th Century. It is divided to many parts :Isstifta7 Msader which are instrumental pieces Then come Attouq and the Silsla which introduce to the poems. The sung pieces begin with the Btaihia: A set of poem composed on the Main mode of the Nuba (There are several Modes in Tunisian Music Thaiil raml Sikah tounssia Ispahan Isbaa√Øn) on a heavily syncopated rhythm called BtaiHi. Then come al barawil, Al khfeiif Al Akhtam which close the Nuba. The rhythms grow fast from a component to anthem of the Nuba. Each component of a Nouba has its specific rhythm which are the same in all the 13 Nouba known today. According to legend, a distinct nuba once existed for every day, holiday and other event, though only thirteen remain. Partway through a nuba, an improvisational section was played in the maqam of the following day to ready the audience for the next performance. =History= The earliest roots of the malouf can be traced to a court musician from Baghdad named Ziryab. He was expelled from the city in 830, and travelled west, stopping finally at Kairouan, the first Muslim city of great power in Africa. The city was a center for North African (Maghebian) culture, and was the capital of the Aghlabite dynasty. Ziryab crossed the Maghreb and then entered Cordoba during a period of cultural innovation among the diverse inhabitants of the region. He became a court musician again, and used influences from the local area, the Maghreb and his native Middle East to form a distinctively Andalusian style. Beginning in the 13th century, Muslims fleeing persecution by Christians in what is now Spain and Portugal settled in cities across North Africa, including Tunis, bringing with them their music. Tunisian malouf, and its closely related cousin in Libya, was later influenced by Ottoman music. This process peaked in the middle of the 18th century, when the Bey of Tunisia, Muhammad al-Rashid, a musician, used Turkish-style instrumental compositions in his work and firmly set the structure of the nuba. Though his system has evolved considerably, most of the instrumental sections of modern nubat are derived from al-Rashid. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Tunisia became a French protectorate and the declining malouf was revitalized. Baron Rodolphe d'Erlanger, a French- naturalized Bavarian living near Tunis, commission a collection of ancient works, working with Ali al-Darwish of Aleppo. Al-Darwish and d'Erlanger's pioneering study of Tunisian music was presented at the International Congress of Arabic Music, held in 1932. Baron Rodolphe d'Erlanger died only a few months after the congress, which revolutionized Arab music across the world. In Tunisia, the meeting inspired The Rachidia, which was formed in 1934 to preserve the malouf. The Rachidia undertook some alterations, revising lyrics that were considered profane, and also constructed two performance spaces in the old city of Tunis. The Institute also helped to transition malouf from being performed by folk ensembles with only a few instrument (including 'ud, tar, darbuka, rabab and bendir) to symphonic pieces inspired by Western classical music and Egyptian ensembles. The most influential such orchestra was called the Rashidiyya Orchestra, led by violinist Muhammad Triki. Rashidiyya Orchestra used a large chorus as well as contrabass, cello, violin, nay, qanun and 'ud sharqi, and followed the developing rules of Arab musical theory and notation. The thirteen surviving nubat were created during this time, distilled from the highly divergent folk forms still in use. Western musical notation was used; along with the popularization of recorded music, the use of improvisation quickly declined. These changes helped to popularize the malouf, though not without critics, and gave the music a reputation as classical art music. After Tunisian independence in 1957, the country's first president, Habib Bourguiba, promoted the malouf, recognizing its unifying potential. The then-director of the Rashidiyya Orchestra, Salah el-Mahdi, wrote the Tunisian national anthem, and eventually also became the leader of the music department of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. His musical theories became a major part of the Orchestra, as well as its successor, Institut Sup√©rieur de Musique.  Mezwed  Purely Tunisian music with pop Tunisian touch. Most popular mezwed singers are Heddi Habbouba, Habib el Khal, Samir Loussif, Hedi Donia,Faouzi Ben Gamra, Zina Gasriniya, Fatma Bousseha,Nour Chiba. Salhi Another authentic Tunisian genre, known as Salhi, can be heard on these tracks from 1931 , some of which are sung by Ibrahim Ben Hadj Ahmed, and others by another singer called Ben Sassi. The style may be related to Berber music, and is just as ancient and authentic as a facet of the (Tunisian) national identity.

During the Soviet period it was often known under name of Celtnieks or Stroitel (in Russian). After dissolution of the Soviet Union, the club became bankrupt and participated in competitions fielding its football academy, DYuSSh Daugavpils. In 1992-1994 there existed for short period Auseklis Daugavpils. =Season 2006= Hibernian v Dinaburg They qualified to play with Hibernian, of Scotland, in the second round of the 2006 Intertoto Cup after beating Havnar B√≥ltfelag, from the Faroe Islands, 2‚Äì1 on aggregate in the first round.

It developed from the earlier ska vocal group, the Wailers, created by Marley with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer in 1963. By late 1963 singers Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith had joined on. By the early 1970s, Marley and Bunny Wailer had learned to play some instruments and brothers Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett (bass) and Carlton Barrett (drums), had joined the band. After Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Marley began touring with new band members. His new backing band included the Barrett brothers, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl \\"Wya\\" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson on percussion. The \\"I Threes\\", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. History The Wailers were formed when self-taught musician Hubert Winston McIntosh (Peter Tosh) met the singers Neville Livingston (Bunny Wailer), and Robert Nesta Marley (Bob Marley) in 1963. =Early years= The lineup was known variously as the Teenagers, the Wailing Rudeboys, the Wailing Wailers and finally just the Wailers. The original lineup featured Junior Braithwaite on vocals, Bob Marley on guitar, Peter Tosh on keyboard, Neville Livingston (a.k.a. Bunny Wailer) on percussion, and Cherry Smith and Beverley Kelso on backing vocals. By 1966 Braithwaite, Kelso and Smith had left the band, which then consisted of the trio Livingston, Marley and Tosh. In 1964, the Wailers topped the Jamaican charts with \\"Simmer Down\\", which was recorded 1963 at Studio One with the rhythm section from studio house band The Skatalites. Some of the Wailers' most notable songs were recorded with Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and his studio band the Upsetters. The Wailers also worked with renowned reggae producer Leslie Kong, who used his studio musicians called Beverley's All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Paul Douglas, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Wright, Rad Bryan, Hux Brown) to record the songs that would be released as an album titled The Best of The Wailers. In 1966, they created a rocksteady record label, the Wail N Soul M. During the early 1970s the Upsetters members Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett and his brother Carlton (Carly) Barrett,Lee Scratch Perry Interview, New Musical Express, 17 November 1984 formed the Wailers Band, providing instrumental backing for The Wailers. The Wailers recorded groundbreaking ska and reggae songs such as \\"Simmer Down\\", \\"Trenchtown Rock\\", \\"Nice Time\\", \\"War\\", \\"Stir It Up\\" and \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\". An attempt at creating a full overview of all the music made by The Wailers prior to their signing to Island Records was made by the Roots Reggae Library. =Line-up changes= The original Wailers line-up disbanded in 1974 due to Tosh and Livingston's refusal to play \\"freak clubs\\". The pair believed doing so would violate their Rastafarian faith.(Marley 2012 by Magnolia Films) Bob Marley formed Bob Marley and the Wailers with himself as guitarist, songwriter and main singer, the Wailers Band as the backing band, and the I Three as backup vocalists. The Wailers Band included the brothers Carlton Barrett and \\"Family Man\\" Barrett on drums and bass respectively, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson playing lead guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl \\"Wya\\" Lindo playing keyboard, and Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson playing percussion. The I Three consisted of Bob Marley's wife Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths. Livingston believed that producer Chris Blackwell, whom he called \\"Chris Whiteworst\\", was responsible for the bad relationship between the band members, as he thought Blackwell released their albums under \\"Bob Marley and the Wailers\\" instead of \\"the Wailers\\" since 1969, which tested their friendship. Perry released two compilation albums for Trojan Records in 1974, Rasta Revolution and African Herbsman, which contained songs from Soul Rebels and Soul Revolution, respectively, and he was the copyright holder of several songs from these albums. These changes caused a major dispute between Marley and Perry, when the former saw the albums, six months after their publication, in the Half Way Road in England. =Later years= Bob Marley and the Wailers, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer all enjoyed considerable success as reggae music continued to gain popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. One of the last performances that included Marley was in 1980 at Madison Square Garden. Several of the group's members have died subsequent to Marley's death in 1981: Carlton Barrett and Tosh (both murdered) in 1987, Braithwaite (also murdered) in 1999, Smith in 2008, and Earl Lindo in 2017. Bunny Wailer and Beverley Kelso are the only surviving members of the group's original line-up. I Three The I Three from left to right: Judy Mowatt, Rita Marley, and Marcia Griffiths The I Three, commonly called I Threes, were formed in 1974 to support Bob Marley and the Wailers after Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer ‚Äì the original Wailer backing vocalists ‚Äì left the band. The three members were Marley's wife Rita Marley, Judy Mowatt and Marcia Griffiths. Their name is intended as a spin on the Rastafarian \\"I and I\\" concept of the Godhead within each person.

It lies within the upper region of the Great Appalachian Valley and drains all the way northward into Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence River drainage basin. The lake is situated along the historical natural (Amerindian) path between the valleys of the Hudson and St. Lawrence Rivers, and so lies on the direct land route between Albany, New York, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The lake extends about on a north-south axis, is deep, and varies from in width, presenting a significant barrier to east‚Äìwest travel. Although the year-round population of the Lake George region is relatively small, the summertime population can swell to over 50,000 residents, many in the village of Lake George region at the southern end of the lake. Lake George drains into Lake Champlain to its north through a short stream, the La Chute River, with many falls and rapids, dropping in its course‚Äîvirtually all of which is within the lands of Ticonderoga, New York, and near the site of the Fort Ticonderoga. Ultimately the waters flowing via the Richelieu River drain into the St. Lawrence River downstream and northeast of Montreal, and then into the North Atlantic Ocean above Nova Scotia. Geography Lake George is located in the eastsouthern Adirondack State Park and is part of the St. Lawrence watershed. Notable landforms include Anthony's Nose, Deer's Leap, Diver's Rock (a jump into the lake), and Double-Diver's (a jump), the Indian Kettles, and Roger's Rock. Some of the surrounding mountains include Black Mountain, Elephant Mountain, Pilot Knob, Prospect Mountain, Shelving Rock, Sleeping Beauty Mountain, Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Tongue Mountain Range. Some of the lake's more famous bays are Basin Bay, Kattskill Bay, Northwest Bay, Oneida Bay, and Silver Bay. The lake is distinguished by \\"The Narrows\\", an island- filled narrow section (approximately long) that is bordered on the west by the Tongue Mountain Range and the east by Black Mountain. In all, Lake George is home to over 170 islands, 148 of them state-owned. They range from the car- sized Skipper's Jib to the larger Vicar's and Long Islands. Camping permits are available for most islands. The lake's deepest point is , between Dome Island and Buck Mountain in the southern quarter of the lake. The northern end of the lake that is located near Ticonderoga is considered the southern end of the Champlain Valley, which includes Lake Champlain, as well as the cities Plattsburgh, New York, and Burlington, Vermont. The Jefferson Project, a collaboration that began in 2014 between IBM, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and the Fund for Lake George, is collecting data from the lake using depth sensors that can monitor currents, pH, salinity, and other data, leading the lake to be called, \\"[t]he smartest lake in the world.\\" Invasive species There are six known invasive species in Lake George. The Asian clam first found in 2010 is the biggest threat, along with the Eurasian watermilfoil. Other invasive species are the Chinese mystery snail, curly-leaf pondweed, spiny water flea, and zebra mussel. History The lake was originally named the Andia-ta-roc-te by local Native Americans. James Fenimore Cooper in his narrative Last of the Mohicans called it the Horican, after a tribe which may have lived there, because he felt the original name was too hard to pronounce. The first European visitor to the area, Samuel de Champlain, noted the lake in his journal on July 3, 1609, but did not name it. In 1646, the French Canadian Jesuit missionary Isaac Jogues, the first European to view the lake, named it Lac du Saint-Sacrement (Lake of the Holy Sacrament), and its exit stream, La Chute (\\"The Fall\\"). On August 28, 1755, William Johnson led British colonial forces to occupy the area in the French and Indian War. He renamed the lake as Lake George for King George II. On September 8, 1755 the Battle of Lake George was fought between the forces of Britain and France resulting in a strategic victory for the British and their Iroquois allies. After the battle, Johnson ordered the construction of a military fortification at the southern end of the lake. The fort was named Fort William Henry after the King's grandson Prince William Henry, a younger brother of the later King George III. In September, the French responded by beginning construction of Fort Carillon, later called Fort Ticonderoga, on a point where La Chute enters Lake Champlain. These fortifications controlled the easy water route between Canada and colonial New York. A French army, and their native allies under general Louis-Joseph de Montcalm laid siege to Fort William Henry in 1757 and burned it down after the British surrender. During the British retreat to Fort Edward they were ambushed and massacred by natives allied to the French, in what would become known as The Massacre at Fort William Henry. On March 13, 1758, an attempted attack on that fort by irregular forces led by Robert Rogers was one of the most daring raids of that war. The unorthodox (to Europeans) tactics of Rogers' Rangers are seen as inspiring the creation of similar forces in later conflicts‚Äîincluding the United States Army Rangers. Lake George's key position on the Montreal-New York water route made possession of the forts at either end‚Äîparticularly Ticonderoga‚Äîstrategically crucial during the American Revolution. Later in the war, British General John Burgoyne's decision to bypass the easy water route to the Hudson River that Lake George offered and, instead, attempt to reach the Hudson though the marshes and forests at the southern end of Lake Champlain, led to the British defeat at Saratoga. On May 31, 1791, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to his daughter, \\"Lake George is without comparison, the most beautiful water I ever saw; formed by a contour of mountains into a basin... finely interspersed with islands, its water limpid as crystal, and the mountain sides covered with rich groves... down to the water-edge: here and there precipices of rock to checker the scene and save it from monotony.\\" In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lake George was a common spot sought out by well-known artists, including Martin Johnson Heade, John F. Kensett, E. Charlton Fortune, Frank Vincent DuMond and Georgia O'Keeffe. =Ethan Allen accident= On October 2, 2005, at 2:55 p.m., the Ethan Allen, a glass-enclosed tourist boat carrying 47 passengers and operated by Shoreline Cruises, capsized during calm weather on the lake. According to reports from a local newspaper, 20 people (mostly senior citizens) died. Initial reports indicated that the tour group was from Canada, but these reports were later found to be incorrect. It was later determined that the group was from the Trenton, Michigan, area on a week-long fall trip along the East Coast by bus and rail, organized by Trenton's parks and recreation department and arranged through a Canadian company. Police said they had never seen a disaster of this magnitude on the lake. The captain survived and cooperated with police.The Albany Times Union, TRAGEDY ON LAKE GEORGE, Special Report; retrieved May 12, 2008. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the incident revealed that, although the boat was rated to carry 50 people when it was manufactured in 1966, subsequent alterations to the boat's design had greatly reduced its stability. At the time of the accident, the boat should have been rated to carry no more than 14 passengers. On February 5, 2007, the captain, Richard Paris, and the company that owned the boat, Shoreline Cruises, were indicted for having only one crew member aboard the boat. More serious charges were not filed because neither the captain nor the owners were aware they were violating safety standards. Character =Tourist destination= Fort William Henry Hotel in 1907 Situated on the rail line halfway between New York City and Montreal, Lake George attracted the era's rich and famous by the late 19th and early 20th century. Members of the Roosevelt, van Rensselaer, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Whitney families visited its shores. The Fort William Henry Hotel, in what is now Lake George Village, and The Sagamore in Bolton Landing opened at this time to serve tourists. The wealthiest visitors were more likely to stay with their peers at their private country estates. The Silver Bay YMCA on Lake George was constructed in 1900. It has since evolved into a summer family camp, serving several hundred organizations and tourists every summer. Since 1913, on the East Shore of Lake George, YMCA Camp Chingachgook has hosted thousands of guests every summer. Lake George is accessible by car via Interstate 87 and by air from Albany International Airport, which is about away. Today, Lake George remains a tourism destination, resort center, and summer colony. Popular activities in the Lake George area include water sports, camping, amusement parks, hiking, paddling, and factory outlet shopping. One of the nation's oldest gathering of hot air balloons occurs every September in nearby Queensbury. Lake George is responsible for generating about $2 billion annually to the local region. =Millionaires' Row= Millionaires' Row is the nickname of a stretch of Bolton Road (now Lake Shore Drive) on the west side of the lake where millionaires built mansions or resided there during the summer months. Such notables as Spencer Trask, Katrina Trask, Edward M. Shepard, George Foster Peabody, Harold Pitcairn, Russell Cornell Leffingwell, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Alfred Stieglitz, Royal C. Peabody, Charles Peabody, Fredrick F. Peabody, Marcella Sembrich, Charles Evan Hughes, Walter Price, William Gerard Beckers, Harry Kendall Thaw, Adolph Ochs, Louise Homer, Sidney Homer, Charles Wood, the Bixby family, and the Tuttle family built or resided in palatial summer homes here. Although sometimes called \\"cottages\\" by their owners, these grand houses typically had dozens of bedrooms and more than of floor space. Millionaire's Row differed markedly from the more rustic summer \\"camps\\" built by other wealthy Adirondack summer residents such as William West Durant and John D. Rockefeller. Unlike the log and timber structures at the camps, the houses of Millionaire's Row were built of stone and masonry in the Tudor Revival, Georgian Revival and Italianate styles. Unlike their contemporaries in Newport and the Hamptons, which were built on tiny pieces of land, the cottages of Millionaires' Row were mansions in the true sense of the word. They were often built on hundreds of acres of pristine lakeside wilderness. With the changing economic climate and the introduction of income tax, the mansions of Millionaires' Row became less sustainable by the 1930s. By the 1950s, with the advent of affordable auto and air travel, Lake George became more attractive to the growing middle class and less so to the \\"jet set\\". Most of the mansions of Millionaires' Row were torn down or turned into hotels and restaurants. Among the surviving mansions are Evelley, Halcyon, Sun Castle (Erlowest), Oak lawn, Wikiosco, Green Harbour, Homeland, Cramer Point, Depe Dene, Cannon Point, Hermstone, Mohican Point, Villa Marie Antoinette‚Äôs gatehouse, Three Brothers Island, Nirvana, and Wapanak.

The team exists in the MC2 Universe, an alternate future to the Marvel Universe. A continuation of the Fantastic Four, the team was originally composed of the Human Torch, his wife Ms. Fantastic/Lyja (a Skrull), the Thing, Big Brain (Reed Richards' remote-controlled robotic body), and Psi-Lord (Franklin Richards, Reed's son). Fictional team biography The team first appeared in What If (volume 2) #105 (1998), an issue that focused on Spider-Girl, the daughter of Spider-Man. Spider-Girl became popular and was given her own series, along with the other characters in the MC2 universe (including the Fantastic Five). The Fantastic Five's series lasted only five issues, but they remained recurring characters in the Spider-Girl title, which lasted for 100 issues in its first volume. A new Fantastic Five mini-series was published in 2007, after the success of two mini-series events set in MC2 line. In the first series, it was revealed that \\"Big Brain\\" is a drone controlled from the Negative Zone, where Sue Storm is held in a kind of stasis. Her powers are holding back a breach in reality, and Reed is at her side. When this problem is corrected, Reed and Sue return to Earth. The team also appears in Last Hero Standing and Last Planet Standing. In Spider-Girl and Last Planet Standing, additional children of the original Fantastic Four are shown as members of the Fantastic Five, including Super-Storm (Torus Storm, son of Lyja and Johnny Storm, who possesses the powers of both parents), Grim (Jacob \\"Jake\\" Grimm, son of Ben Grimm, stuck in a rock-like yet strong form like his father), and Rad (Alyce Grimm, daughter of Ben Grimm, twin sister of Jacob, appears to have radiation-oriented powers, including flight). Doom, aka Kristoff Vernard, is also shown to be a member of the \\"young\\" Fantastic Five; he wears Doctor Doom-like armor. A five issue mini- series called Fantastic Five was published. It features such characters as: Psi-Lord, Invisible Woman, Thing, Sharon Ventura, Human Torch, Ms. Fantastic (Lyja Storm), Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom. Doom, imprisoned for years by the Sub-Mariner, finally breaks free, and imbues countless robotic duplicates with the Power Cosmic. Just one robot manages to decimate the Five and destroy Ben's robotic implants. Although the team manages to stop the robot by trapping it in a stasis beam, the real Doom appears and banishes the younger members to a spaceship orbiting earth, and trapping the others within Mr. Fantastic's own rubbery body. Franklin has the others remove the inner shielding of the ship, and exposes himself to a massive amount of cosmic rays, which increases his powers dramatically. He manages to destroy the Doombot guarding them, but is greatly pained by using his increased powers. Doom, seeking to humble Reed once and for all, has the other freed from his body, and has Reed and himself plugged into an Infinity Device for a mental duel, the loser of which will have his mind sent to the Crossroads of Infinity. Reed's teammates use the opportunity to escape, and with Kristoff's help, shut down the cosmically powered Doombots. Reed and Doom are shown to be evenly matched in their duel, and both minds are sent to the crossroads as a result, leaving their bodies blank and motionless. Sue and Kristoff decide to remain in Latveria and look after Reed, while Alyce goes home with her mother. Ben's son Jacob takes Reed's place in the F5. Roster =Active= *Johnny Storm, the Human Torch - While Reed and Sue were in the Negative Zone, Johnny took command of the team. On their return, however, Johnny would clash with Reed over leadership techniques, even considering whether to form his own team. *Ben Grimm, the Thing - Badly injured in a final battle with Terrax, Ben was outfitted with mechanical implants. Recently, his injured flesh has shown signs of regeneration. *Lyja Storm, Ms. Fantastic - Johnny's wife, a member of the shape-shifting Skrull race. *Franklin Richards, Psi-Lord - Son of Reed and Sue, and master of telepathy and telekinesis. After absorbing a large amount of cosmic ray radiation, his head now has the appearance of a glowing skull, and he must wear a helmet to protect others from the excess energies. *Jacob Grimm, Grim - The son of Ben Grimm and Sharon Ventura, he is similar in appearance to his father, and also possesses his strength levels. He joins the F5 in Reed's absence. =Former= *Sue Storm, the Invisible Woman - Badly injured during a battle with Hyperstorm, she too was occupied in the Negative Zone until recently. She decides to remain in Latveria and care for her catatonic husband. *Kristoff Vernard, Doom - Former ward of Doctor Doom. After the monarch's disappearance, he joined the Fantastic Five. In battle, he utilizes Doom's armor and weaponry. He too remains in Latveria, attempting to find and dismantle Doom's weapon stockpiles. *Alyce Grimm, Rad - Jacob's sister, she is able to control and project Cosmic Radiation. She decides to forgo the superhero life and returns home with her mother. *Torus Storm, Super-Storm - Johnny and Lyja's young son. Not an actual member of the team, but he insists on leaping into the fray whenever he can. He has his father's fire powers and his mother's shape-shifting abilities. In battle, he regularly takes the form of an older version of himself wearing an F5 uniform with a \\"6\\" on its chest. Other versions *What If..? #1 is set in an alternative universe where Spider-Man joins the Fantastic Four (rather than leaving when he learns there isn't a salary, as happened in The Amazing Spider-Man #1), and they become the Fantastic Five. This universe is revisited in What If..? #21, by which time Susan Storm has left the team and chosen to marry Namor of Atlantis. *What If..? (vol. 2) #27 showed Namor joining the Fantastic Four, briefly making it the Fantastic Five until Reed Richards left to found Richards Technology. *In Exiles #44, the Weapon X team‚Äîled by Hyperion‚Äîbegan their conquest of the actual world they were on, by killing its superhero teams. At the beginning of the issue, they began killing the members of the Fantastic Five, which consisted of Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the Thing, and Spider-Man as a fifth member. *In Excalibur (vol. 1) #51, the Fantastic Five was the Earth-99476 counterpart of the Fantastic Four, consisting of dinosaur versions of the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man. *\\"The All New Fantastic Five?!?\\" also appears in Spider-Girl #87. Co-creator Tom DeFalco states that the new F5 were to appear in Fantastic Five #6 had the series continued. *Fatal Five - Due to Seth's return to action, Spider-Girl and American Dream travel to an alternate universe that was last seen in A-Next #11 to recruit Thunderstrike.

We The Curious is \\"an idea and a place for everybody\\", and its aim is \\"to create a culture of curiosity\\". It features over 250 interactive exhibits over two floors, and members of the public and school groups can also engage with the Live Science Team over programming in the kitchen, studio and on live lab. We The Curious is also home of the United Kingdom's first 3D planetarium. As part of its charitable status, We The Curious has an extensive community engagement programme.https://www.wethecurious.org/community In regular weekends throughout the year We The Curious hosts \\"Hello!\\" weekends for communities who are currently under-represented in their visitors while also providing a community membership for charities and groups working in and for the community. Alongside this, We The Curious is working with local schools and community groups to plan exhibits and programming for the future.  History  = Background and origins = @Bristol opened in 2000 as the successor to the Exploratory, a science museum and demonstration centre, founded by Richard Gregory in the former terminus train shed at Bristol Temple Meads railway station (later home to the British Empire & Commonwealth Museum). The Exploratory was a separate organisation and none of the exhibits or staff were transferred when Bristol's new museum opened in a city centre site as part of the regeneration of the historical Floating Harbour. The project was funded with ¬£44.3 million from the National Lottery, Millennium Commission, South West of England Regional Development Agency, and a further ¬£43.4 million from commercial partners (including a controversial donation from Nestl√©) and Bristol City Council. The selection and design of exhibits were criticised by Gregory and other scientific adviser as being \\"totally inappropriate to the spirit of science\\". Go√©ry Delac√¥te served as Chief Executive from 2005 until 2012. The centre is situated on the former Canon's Wharf. Wildwalk and the IMAX cinema occupied a modified 19th century former lead-works building, and Explore occupied a 1906 railway goods shed measuring . The goods shed was one of the first buildings to use reinforced concrete and both buildings are Grade II listed buildings. The buildings are located around Millennium Square - also part of the regeneration ‚Äî and Pero's Bridge, a footbridge across the harbour which links it to the Arnolfini art gallery, Bristol Industrial Museum and Queen Square. At its opening the centre consisted of Explore, which contains features on mechanics, sound and light, computer science, space and the human brain; Wildwalk, a science centre comprising two artificial rainforests, aquariums and other ecology-related exhibits; and an IMAX theatre. = Closure of Wildwalk and IMAX = Wildwalk-At-Bristol and the IMAX Theatre from the outside. The large translucent canopy was the roof of the botanical house Wildwalk and the IMAX Theatre closed at the end of March 2007 due to lower popularity with the public, running cost and a lack of funding and government support. Despite At-Bristol's insistence that the government should have supported Wildwalk, the science centres that were established by the Millennium Commission in 2000 were intended to be self-financing, once established. This proved difficult for some of the 18 centres established in 2000, with The Earth Centre, Big Idea and Wildwalk all closing within 10 years. The Wildwalk building was converted into an aquarium by Blue Reef Aquarium, with the IMAX cinema being used to show nature and wildlife films. The Aquarium owners took the decision to stop screening IMAX films in November 2011, but the space is still used for venue hire events. Though the charity had no problems securing short term funds and grants to cover this when the centre was set up, enabling them to run the three attractions for just over six years, by 2005/2006 most of these had either decreased greatly or ended altogether. This left only two options: close the whole centre, or close Wildwalk and IMAX, enabling existing funds to be channelled exclusively to Explore. As Explore was more popular with visitors, whereas Wildwalk and the IMAX theatre were more expensive to run, it was decided that the second option was viable, and in this way Explore could become financially viable in the future. For these reasons, Wildwalk and the IMAX theatre closed for the last time on Saturday, 31 March 2007, making 45 people redundant. alt=The Regional Development Agency worked alongside Bristol City Council to find new uses for the buildings, and at the same time the University of the West of England expressed an interest in taking over the buildings to use for public outreach work with schools. In April 2008 it was announced that the Wildwalk building was to be converted into an aquarium and that the IMAX will be used to show nature and wildlife films. The ¬£4 million plan by Newquay firm Blue Reef Aquarium, intended to provide a site for tropical marine and freshwater creatures, which opened in October 2009. = 2010-2017 = Explore rebranded to At-Bristol in June 2010. Since opening in 2000, At-Bristol had had an annual operating deficit of around ¬£1.5 million to be filled by fundraising. = Rebrand as We The Curious = In September 2017, At-Bristol reopened as We The Curious, with a new mission to \\"create a culture of curiosity\\", in response to a consultation showing that the previous mission to \\"make science accessible to all\\" was no longer unique. Testing showed that the audience wanted the centre to be more challenging, to feature art as well as science and to be more inclusive. A new manifesto was produced in response to these themes, and the over 400 new names were considered before deciding on We The Curious. The name was tested with members, focus groups, volunteers and staff and it tested at 92% positive. We The Curious is currently working on Project What If, funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of the Inspiring Science fund. We The Curious is currently run by a team of over 150 part-time and full-time staff, led by Anna Starkey and Donna Speed as Chief Creative Officer and Chief Operations Officer respectively.  Current exhibits  The exhibitions are themed into various areas, some of which are permanent features, others change on a periodic basis. The ground floor of We The Curious is being re-fitted with brand new exhibits in 2020. * The Planetarium - The UK's first 3D planetarium with seasonal, presenter-led star shows for all ages. * The Tinkering Space - Opened in July 2016. A space on the first floor to design, create and invent with a giant ball run, a Baxter (robot), Nao (robot), 3D printers and an air table. * Food - A kitchen and living greenhouse with exhibits about the science of food and programming spaces to have a go at making your own. * Live Lab - An evolving lab space where visitors can experience current science including practical lab skills, research and dissections. * All About Us - This opened in Spring 2011 and has 50 interactive exhibits which allow visitors to discover how amazing the human body is. * Real Brain - As part of the All About Us exhibition, We The Curious has an exhibit that displays a real human brain. Real Brain has been produced to give visitors an understanding of medical science research. * Animate It! - this exhibition was developed with Aardman Animations. Visitors can make their own animated films (2D and 3D), see a film set from Wallace & Gromit's 'A Matter of Loaf and Death', or make Morph spin in a Praxinoscope. * Our World - Allows visitor to discover the world around us through investigation. Includes Icy Bodies, Giant Bubbles and the Turbulent Orb. * Your Amazing Brain ‚Äì The second large section on the ground floor, this area deals with the human brain, in particular optical illusions and memory. * Curiosity Zone ‚Äì Incorporating most of the upper level, this area deals with sound, light, force, magnets. * Space Gallery ‚Äì This area includes exhibits about space travel and discovery, and the 3D Planetarium, in which 6-8 shows are given daily. We The Curious has its own exhibition workshop on site. Many of the interactive exhibits on the exhibition floor have been made by the workshop team in house, including the distinctive 'Hamster wheel' of the 'Wet Move-it' exhibition. We The Curious is housed in a former railway goods shed, which was renovated to house the centre. The renovations included the addition of a large glass atrium to the North of the building, and stainless-steel sphere to the south, housing the planetarium. The architect behind the renovation was Chris Wilkinson. The building includes a eutectic tank, which is a high transparent tube filled with thousands of balls containing eutectic salts. As the temperature within the building rises, the crystals within the balls melt, taking in the heat and cooling the building. As the building cools, the salts crystallise again, giving out heat. In this way, the tank helps keep the temperature within the centre constant.  Former exhibits  * Wildwalk - Wildwalk was an Ecology Science centre, which contained two artificial rainforests, aquariums, hands-on exhibits, and live animal exhibits. The centre comprised a large building (previously a lead-works building) with a ‚Äòliving rainforest‚Äô attached to the southern side, and was designed by Michael Hopkins & Partners. The centre housed animals, including butterflies, crabs, chameleons, frogs, finches, partridges, piranhas, seahorses, scorpions, snakes, spiders, tarantulas, triggerfish: in total over 150 species from all major animal groups. The botanical house was split into two distinct sections: Plants on Land, which traced the development of plants from simple mosses through to complex flowering plants; and Tropical Forests, which showcased plants from tropical continents, including a cycad which produced a rare, bright red cone tall and in circumference in 2003. Following Wildwalks closure, all animals and plants were re-homed to other zoos and natural history venues. Some elements of the exhibits from Wildwalk have been incorporated into Explore. The first part of the botanical house in Wildwalk- At-Bristol; Plants on Land Insects; one of the exhibits in Wildwalk-At-Bristol * IMAX - Housed in the same building as Wildwalk, the IMAX theatre was the first of the three At-Bristol attractions to open, on 20 April 2000. Since opening, the theatre received over 1.1 million visitors, and screened 70 films. The longest running film, and thus that with the highest attendance figures, was Cyberworld 3D.  Charitable status  As an educational charity, We The Curious fundraises to do work that is not necessarily profitable, but fulfils their vision 'to create a culture of curiosity'. This work includes specific projects, outreach work to groups who are unable to visit We The Curious, and bringing hard to reach groups to We The Curious. These groups include community groups, low-income schools and hospitals. Much of this work is made possible by the work of volunteers who have been part of At-Bristol and We The Curious since 2006 We The Curious has also recently embarked on a career ladder scheme with partnership school City Academy.  Venue Hire  There are rooms and roof terraces above the exhibition space that are used for private hire. These have been used by organisations such as Sky News, the BBC and FameLab as well as other conferences, meetings and events. These spaces have also been used for weddings and civil partnerships. We The Curious also hires out the exhibition floor, Planetarium, Millennium Square and Anchor Square.  Sustainability  Since its inception sustainability has been a key part of the We The Curious project. The We The Curious building (formerly Explore and At-Bristol) is an example of low-energy design with a phase-change storage tank enabling air source heat pumps to heat and cool the building using only night surplus electricity. At-Bristol (as the centre was then known) joined the 10:10 project in 2010 in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. One year later they announced that they had reduced their carbon emissions (according to 10:10's criteria) by 12%. Since 2010 We The Curious has been on an intense sustainability drive to improve its performance in all areas of sustainability whilst also ensuring that the subject is included in its educational and promotional work. In 2011 At-Bristol was awarded a Gold Green Tourism Award and a West of England Carbon Champions Carbon Champion Award and in 2012 a Silver South West Sustainable Tourism Award. March 2012 also saw At-Bristol's environmental performance being improved further with the installation of a 50-kilowatt peak solar photovoltaic array to produce electricity for the building from the sun. We The Curious now has 'Strive for Sustainable futures' as one of the core pillars of its manifesto, and is constantly reviewing its environmental impact in order to try and become carbon neutral in line with the Bristol One City Plan. Part of this is to use the platforms available to educate the public about pressing environmental concerns, such as supporting sustainable palm oil and reducing air pollution.

Since American colonization, popular traditions such as rap and hip hop have been integrated into Somoan music. Traditional Samoan musical instruments includes several different distinctive instruments, including a fala, which is a rolled-up mat beaten with sticks and several types of slit drum.  Instruments  Traditional Samoan musical instruments included a fala, which is a rolled-up mat beaten with sticks. It is an idiophone which often accompanied choral singing. Another idiophone, a soundingboard, sometimes accompanied the solo recitation of poetry. A conch shell was blown for signaling. Amusement for small groups and individuals in private was afforded by a jaw harp, a raft panpipe, and a nose-blown flute. Samoan wooden slit drums and variants have been used throughout Samoa for over a thousand years. There are many uses for these wooden drums, including calling village meetings, in times of war and peace, songs/chants and dance, and signalling long distances in inter-island naval warfare. In recent times they are used predominantly for calling chiefly and royal ceremonies as well as contemporary religious practices. These are the five Samoan slit drum variants from largest to smallest. 1) Logo - felled trees - largest of the drums - The logo can only be played by being struck from the side, for instance by sliding the beater or very large log-like playing stick across the top of the drums to hit the slit lip on the other side. The logo was used to announce the king of Samoa, high chiefs and monarchy in times of old. The logo was also used to announce attacks and signals during times of war see re: Samoan Civil War, the Fijian Wars and also the Tongan Wars. Samoa also has recorded historical records of lesser known battles with neighbouring islands of Manono, Pukapuka, Tokelau, Tuamotu and Rarotonga, these battles may be classed as independent isolated skirmishes and inter-Island skirmishes between large familial klan groups. 2) 2 x Lali - large drum - The Lali are always played in pairs by two drummers. One of them beats the larger of the two, this is called the Tatasi, the other drummer plays the smaller Lali in the rhythmic pattern called the Talua. Both slit drums are played with sticks called Auta. The Lali were said to be introduced from Fiji via Tonga before European discovery.. 3) Talipalau . The Talipalau skin drum was introduced to Samoa from east Polynesia in the 1800s, possibly as a result of early missionary society activities in both regions. 4) Pate - this hand-held slit drum was introduced from Tahiti in the 1800s, probably by British missionaries or their Tahitian converts. 5) Nafa - samaller slit drum drum also made from Milo wood. Now obsolete, only the name remains in proverbial expressions. \\"Amerika Samoa\\", a song with words by Mariota Tiumalu Tuiasosopo and music by Napoleon Andrew Tuiteleleapaga, has been the official territorial anthem of American Samoa since 1950. \\"The Banner of Freedom,\\" a song that honors the flag of Samoa, has been the national anthem of Samoa since 1962; it was composed by Sauni Iiga Kuresa. Post-European contact Samoa police brass band marching in Apia to flag raising ceremony. The band marches every morning Mondays - Fridays in Samoa. With the introduction of Christianity, especially after the arrival of LMS missionaries in 1830, the music of Samoa was greatly influenced by Western evangelical hymnody and popular music, particularly North American popular music. Two stringed instruments quickly became commonplace in the islands: the guitar (kitara) and in the early 20th century the 'ukulele. By the end of the 19th century, European-style brass bands had come into existence in the major towns. As the islands were Christianized late in the 19th century, ancient songs, accompanied by the percussive sound of sticks beating on a rolled mat, gave way to church choirs singing to the harmonies of pedaled organs. Later, radio transmissions brought more variety, as local artists and audiences embraced each wave of \\"new\\" music. The arrival of U.S. Marines during World War II helped solidify the affinity for American popular music. Many earlier bands copied or imitated this music‚Äîa trend that continues. It is common practice and well accepted for Samoan musicmakers to take a Western song, replace the lyrics with Samoan words, and reintroduce the tune as an original. The guitar and 'ukulele became the usual instruments for composing and performing music. That sound is now often replaced by the electronic keyboard and the multiplex of sounds and faux instruments available with it. Many current Samoan musicians \\"upgrade\\" old Samoan tunes with new technology, or imitate and copy American popular music. Modern music Modern pop and rock have a large audience in Samoa, as do several indigenous bands, which have abandoned most elements of Samoan traditional music, though there are folksy performers. Some pop musicians in New Zealand learned new dance styles on a trip to the islands of Samoa, an important early node in transmitting and translating U.S street dance to Aotearoa. Recently, the Samoan population has seen a resurgence of old Samoan songs, remixed in the style of Hawaiian reggae, but with some traditional elements, such as the use of the pate and the chord structure still in use. New Zealand continues to produce modern popular Samoan stars, such as Jamoa Jam and Pacific Soul. Even traditional hymns (pese lotu) have seen a fair amount of change. Some pop bands, such as the RSA Band and the Mount Vaea Band, are associated with hotels; some hotel bands have toured in New Zealand and elsewhere. Pop musicians include the Lole, Golden Ali'is, The Five Stars, and Jerome Gray, whose \\"We Are Samoa\\" remains an unofficial national anthem. A Samoan group called Le Pasefika, going against the current trend by playing only old music, has become the hottest-selling Samoan group in the United States. The nearly three decades of Samoan involvement in street dance and rap music in the United States has significantly affected cultural production in places where Samoans settled, particularly New Zealand. In the early 1980s, Footsoulijah, four Samoan performers from Wellington, credit the Blue City Strutters, who later became the hip-hop group Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E, for spreading their lifelong interest in street dance and their eventual gravitation towards hiphop. Footsoulijah is animated and colorful, and always perform in camouflage fatigues, which represent their militaristic name. The group composed the anthem \\"Represent for My People,\\" which includes the chorus \\"Always represent for my peoples / Pacific islanders of foreign soil / style lethal / take a look as we enter the next chapter / flip the script / Polynesian is my flavour.\\" There is currently a dichotomy between old and new in cultural aspects of Samoan life, especially dance. Some assert, \\"Whereas Samoan music has adopted guitars and other musical instruments, dance, which relies solely upon the performers body (with some exceptions‚Äîfire dance, knife dance, etc) still requires the performer to retain grace and move their arms and hands in the approved fashion\\" but a National Geographic article from 1985 shows a \\"juxtaposition of 'tradition' and 'modernity' with two markedly different photographs of Samoan youth.\\"April K. Henderson, \\"Dancing Between Islands: Hip Hop and the Samoan Diaspora.\\" In The Vinyl Ain‚Äôt Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, edited b7y Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, pp. 180‚Äì199. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press, 200. One photograph has a Samoan child in traditional garb, dancing in a traditional way; the other shows a youth dressed in typical hiphop-style dancing. Like other Samoans, Kosmo, one of the most famous Samoan hip-hop artists, picked up his dance moves while living in California. He integrated a combination of a bit of strutting, a little boogaloo and popping, and some tutting into his music. He learned the dance while staying with family in Carson, a community that drew large numbers of Samoans relocating from the islands in the 1950s-1970s. As he discovered, popping and other 'street dance' forms thoroughly saturated the lives of Samoan youth growing up in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Carson and neighboring Compton and Long Beach. He vividly remembers, \\"all the coolest cats was poppin' down at [Carson's] Scott Park.\\" When he returned to New Zealand, his vocabulary brought him prestige among his peers, most of whom tried to integrate dance moves from movies. \\"Kosmo didn‚Äôt consider himself any good until he returned to New Zealand. . . . Here they were just doing the basics, he knew more.\\" For young artists, this hiphop- oriented form of dancing was not only a way to express oneself creatively, but also a powerful sexual tool: ‚ÄúFor young men, dance skills also helped to attract the young women who were always present either as critical audience or fellow dancers. As Kosmo recalls, ‚ÄúAll the poppers got the girls,‚Äù highlighting another case of dance as an equalizing sexual power tool utilized by both sexes in global hip hop. In 1990, Kosmo and two fellow Samoans created The Mau, a hiphop group named for the organization that pushed for Samoan independence under the German and New Zealand colonial administrations. Although the name was rooted in Samoan history, it demonstrates U.S. influences. Similar to the movement of black consciousness in America, the motto for the Mau movement in Samoa was Samoa Mo Samoa 'Samoa for Samoans'. The group continued to articulate a diasporic Samoan cultural nationalism by drawing upon their knowledge of Samoan history, as well as the popular stories of the Black Power movement presently circulating in American hiphop. Their combination of Samoan heritage and American iconography influenced many groups that followed. Samoans abroad have achieved some musical renown. The Boo-Yaa TRIBE had a brief flirtation with the American mainstream, and the Samoan Sisters found more lasting fame in New Zealand. The shows My Idol and Samoa Star Search became important musical competitions in Samoa. Modern Samoan music shows influence from electrical instruments, jazz, and reggae, and even some house and techno styles. International Samoa has produced well-known artists. The band Past To Present / Ilanda (1990‚Äì2006) (which consisted of three Samoans and one MƒÅori: Frank Laga'aia, Lennie Keller, Norman Keller & Leighton Hema; Hema later left the band) gained popularity and commercial success in Samoa, New Zealand, Australia, and the United States; its achievement has not yet been equaled by any other islander band. In 2006, it was still in the music industry, touring, recording, or producing, as in its last production of Australia's \\"Young Divas.\\" A band with a similar career path and success was Kulcha, based in Sydney, which produced two albums but disbanded after a couple of years. The Katinas, whose parents are Assembly of God Pastors, moved to the United States at one point, are another popular Samoan Gospel band and are active members of the Assembly of God Church. It performed at the Junior Youth Christian Program in Melbourne, Australia, in 2005. References Bibliography * Kolinsky, Mieczyslaw. 1930.

Channelization made it one of the most heavily used bodies of water in the Port of New York and New Jersey and thus one of the most polluted industrial sites in the US, containing years of discarded toxins, an estimated of spilled oil, including the Greenpoint oil spill, raw sewage from New York City‚Äôs sewer system, and other accumulation from a total of 1,491 sites. Newtown Creek was proposed as a potential Superfund site in September 2009, and received that designation on September 27, 2010. Course Aerial photograph of Newtown Creek (2013). View looking east. The creek begins near the intersection of 47th Street and Grand Avenue on the Brooklyn-Queens border at the intersection of the East Branch and English Kills. It empties into the East River at 2nd Street and 54th Avenue in Long Island City, opposite Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan at 26th Street. Its waterfront, and that of its tributaries Dutch Kills, Whale Creek, Maspeth Creek, and English Kills are heavily industrialized. Combined sewer overflow (CSO) pipes drain into all four major tributaries, as well as the East Branch of the creek; during rainstorms, these handle raw sewage. Because the surrounded neighborhoods are completely sewerized, the creek has little natural inflow of natural freshwater, and is largely stagnant except as a result of tides. Its outgoing flow of per year consists of CSO, urban runoff, raw domestic sewage, and industrial wastewater. There is a layer (in some places ) of polluted sludge that has congealed on the creek bed. The Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), used only for freight west of Jamaica, runs along the north bank. = Tributaries = Dutch Kills starts at 47th Avenue and 29th Street in Long Island City, and empties into Newtown Creek on the right bank. The course of Dutch Kills is lined mainly with warehouses. Formerly, its headwaters were at Northern Boulevard and 33rd Street. It formed a navigable stream along with Sunswick Creek to the north, making it easy for merchants to transport produce and goods along the creek. Whale Creek starts at what is now the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and empties into the creek on the left bank opposite Dutch Kills. It originally extended further south to Greenpoint Avenue, but was straightened and turned into a canal in the 20th century. Much of the creek was infilled to make way for the treatment plant. Today, the Newtown Creek Nature Walk runs along the remaining spur of the creek. Maspeth Creek starts on the right bank, within Maspeth, Queens, and runs about before emptying into Newtown Creek. Prior to the industrial development of Queens, Maspeth Creek originated on the Ridgewood Plateau, a plateau that separated the watersheds of Newtown Creek to the south and Flushing River to the east. English Kills originates from a CSO pipe at 465 Johnson Avenue in East Williamsburg. It drains of sewage annually. The present path of English Kills was straightened in the late 19th century. The Kills is crossed by the LIRR Bushwick Branch and the Metropolitan Avenue Bridge. The East Branch originates at Metropolitan and Onkerdonk Avenues, at a CSO pipe that drains annually. It is crossed only by the Grand Street Bridge. History = Early history = The creek derives its name from New Town (Nieuwe Stad), which was the name for the Dutch and British settlement in what is now Elmhurst, Queens. Before the nineteenth century urbanization and industrialization of the surrounding neighborhoods, Newtown Creek was a longer and shallower tidal waterway,\\"Map of part of the village of Laurel Hill : about one mile from East River, situated on Newtown Creek opposite Greenpoint and Brooklyn\\" Queens Library Digital Archive wide enough that it contained islands, including Mussel Island and Furman Island. It drained parts of what are now the neighborhoods of Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Greenpoint in Brooklyn; and Maspeth, Ridgewood, Sunnyside, and Long Island City in Queens. At the time of the American Revolution, British General Warren had his headquarters along the creek.\\"Revolutionary War Encampment and Field at the Laurel Hill Site\\" Queens Library Digital Archive The Sackett House was inherited by the wife of DeWitt Clinton, and Clinton stayed there during much of the planning of the Erie Canal project. Apples called Newtown Pippins originated on the estate of Gershom Moore there, and soon had a wide reputation, appearing on the \\"Select List\\" of apples issues by the Horticultural Society of London, and drawing the praise of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Queen Victoria, who, after tasting the fruit, revoked the import tax on apples. Mouth of the Creek, seen from Pulaski Bridge. Manhattan Avenue Bridge formerly connected Manhattan Avenue on the left bank to Vernon Boulevard =Industrialization= Farmers used the creek to barge their goods to market early in the 19th century, but traffic on the creek increased dramatically when petroleum from Pennsylvania was shipped up the creek to facilities which had once distilled illuminating oil from coal. More refineries sprang up, including Robert Chesebrough's for making petroleum jelly, marketed as Vaseline. There was only one refinery in Queens in 1860, but the demand for kerosene and other petroleum products increased the number dramatically, all of which required large parcels of land for storage and processing, as well as pipelines for transporting the product. John D. Rockefeller decided that Standard Oil would be based in the Newtown Creek area, and soon began buying up the refineries of rivals, until by the 1880s the company was processing of crude oil weekly, employing two thousand people in their more than 100 stills. The pastoral land around the creek became \\"a vast interconnected complex of wharves, stills, tanks, and pipelines,\\" to service not only the refineries, but also the facilities of related industries such as manufacturers of paint and varnish, and chemical companies which produced sulfuric acid. It is estimated that, in all, these industrial facilities produced of waste material each week, which was burnt off, or discarded into the air or the water of the creek. The waste included sludge acid, a tar-like substance which was sold to companies that used it as an ingredient in superphosphate fertilizer. These companies, which built factories close to the source of their raw material, then dumped their waste into the environment, as did the chemical companies with the sulfur that was the waste from producing sulfuric acid. By the mid-19th century, Newtown Creek had become a major industrial waterway, with the city starting to dump raw sewage into it in 1866. It was bounded along most of its length by retaining walls, and the shipping channel was maintained by dredging. Public protests over the degradation of the waterway and the surrounding area, and frequent newspaper expos√©s did little to ameliorate the problem, considering the economic benefit of the industries located along the creek and nearby. Queens was not yet a part of New York City, meaning that the city's Board of Health had no jurisdiction there, and the Brooklyn Board of Health sided with the polluters in court. Even a report from The New York Times in 1885 that Standard Oil was dumping sludge acid into the creek, covering the banks at low tide, made little difference. By the end of the 19th century, the Times was reporting that the creek was totally devoid of any lifeforms. The oil industry was centered in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Across the creek, in Laurel Hill or West Maspeth, Queens, chemical plants and copper smelting facilities also polluted the waterway. The largest was the Laurel Hill Chemical Works, owned by Phelps Dodge, which was in operation between 1871 and 1983. At its peak the company employed approximately 1,250 people, but the workforce declined when the company closed the smelter, and eventually the site was sold to the United States Postal Service in 1986. When the USPS discovered unacceptable levels of heavy metal waste from the smelting process, the U.S. Attorney's office forced Phelps Dodge to void the sale, take the property back, and to clean it up, which, as of 2016, has not been done. A canal to connect Newtown Creek with Flushing River was first proposed in the late 19th century. The canal would have flushed out the stagnant water from Maspeth Creek and created a direct route between the two waterways, but was opposed by residents of central Queens, who were against the industrialization of what was then farmland. In 1914, surveys were made for the construction of a canal to connect Flushing River and Newtown Creek, plans for which dated back at least a century. The canal was never built. A dredging project for the creek, approved in 1929, eliminated Mussel Island by the 1930s. Around the same time, the small Shanty Creek on the eastern shore of Furman Island was drained, and the island became part of Maspeth.  Notable pollution incidents  Before 1950, bulk-oil storage facilities near the corner of Manhattan Avenue and Huron Street were spilling petroleum in amounts that were eventually more than the Exxon Valdez oil spill. An underground explosion at the same corner added to the problem. BP, Chevron, and ExxonMobil have since removed half of the spill, about , from the creek and surrounding area, selling the oil that was removed. In 1973 the Peter van Iderstine plant which had been turning butcher's discards and at least one 10-ton elephant into fertilizer, animal feed, and glue since 1855 was charged with contaminating the creek with animal fats. The plant closed two years later but the smell of burning animals lingered. In 1978 a United States Coast Guard helicopter on a routine patrol discovered the Greenpoint oil spill, a discharge that lasted another 30 years and spilled in total three times the oil of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In the early 2000s, during a construction boom, construction companies dumped concrete slurry into the creek. The city fined Empire Transit Mix in 2005 for ridding itself of its slurry through a secret pipe. The discharges of some other companies had pH levels equal to that of household ammonia. Three \\"digester eggs\\" at Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant Newtown Creek from the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge =Cleanup= The first steps towards cleaning up the toxic environment of Newtown Creek came in 1924, when the federal government passed an oil pollution law, albeit one which had been weakened by the industry as it made its way through Congress. In 1967 the city built the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, which is now the largest sewage treatment facility operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. Located on the south bank near the creek's mouth in Greenpoint, the plant handles a large portion of the drainage from the East Side of Manhattan. Sewage from the Financial District, Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Midtown East and the East Side up to 71st Street flows through of sewer pipes into interceptor pipes to the Thirteenth Street Pumping Station at 13th Street and Avenue D, from where it is sent under the East River to the plant. Normal influx is per day, which increases to during wet weather. When a significant overflow occurred during the New York City blackout of 1977 ( of raw sewage spilled into the East River), the federal government ordered in 1995 that the city build back-up facilities. Despite this, the Northeast blackout of 2003 produced of raw sewage spilled. In 1998, the city started its program to expand the facility. Construction was completed in 2014, and the plant remained opened throughout the renovation process. The plant's unusual aesthetics, especially its 140-foot (42 meter) tall metallic \\"digester eggs\\" which are illuminated at night with blue lights, have made it a local landmark. In part to appease neighborhood residents who initially opposed the plant's expansion, the City of New York built a nature walk alongside Newtown Creek just outside the plant's perimeter in 2009. Later, the North Brooklyn Boat Club built a boatyard and education center with funds from the Exxon's settlement with the state to allow access to the creek.Watson, Ryan (October 1, 2012) \\"A Dream On Its Way to Reality: The Greenpoint Boathouse & Environmental Education Center\\" Greenpoint Waterfront Association for Parks and Planning (GWAPP). Retrieved July 28, 2013 Even with the expansion of the plant, as of 2014, the city is still not in full compliance with the 1972 federal Clean Water Act, which mandates that secondary treatment should remove 85% of pollutants from incoming sewage, or with New York State's 1992 order for the city to prevent overflows by 2013.

In 2007, residents of Greenpoint, Brooklyn and the New York State Attorney General's Office filed lawsuits regarding the Greenpoint oil spill. On September 27, 2010, the federal Environmental Protection Agency designated Newtown Creek as a Superfund site, preparing the way for evaluation and environmental remediation of the stream. Environment advocacy groups supported the decision. Water quality Although the wastewater treatment plant has been expanded, even small amounts of rainfall can overwhelm the system and lead to the dumping of raw sewage and street runoff directly into the creek from 23 different locations. These combined sewer overflows contribute to ongoing pollution of the creek. The margin between rainfall and sewage overflow only thins with the city's further development. In addition, it was reported in December 2013 that in addition to oil and human waste, EPA crews were expected to find toxic substances such as arsenic, cesium-137, and polychlorinated biphenyls.  Bridges  The westernmost crossing of the creek is the Pulaski Bridge, built in 1954 to replace the Vernon Avenue Bridge slightly to the west.\\"Vernon Avenue Bridge\\" Queens Library Digital Archive Upstream is the Greenpoint Avenue Bridge, built in 1987 to replace bridges that dated to the 1850s. The final bridge upstream, before the convergence of English Kills and the East Branch, is the Kosciuszko Bridge carrying the Brooklyn Queens Expressway (Interstate 278); it was built in 1939 and replaced in 2017‚Äì2019. There are several now-demolished bridges that crossed Newtown Creek. The Vernon Avenue Bridge, connecting Manhattan Avenue in Brooklyn with Vernon Boulevard in Queens, was a Warren truss bridge that existed from 1905 to 1954. The Penny Bridge, near the current site of the Kosciuszko Bridge, was a swing bridge connecting Meeker Avenue in Brooklyn with Laurel Hill Boulevard in Queens. Various forms of the Penny Bridge existed from 1803 until the Kosciuszko Bridge was completed in 1939. Finally, the Maspeth Plank Road bridge connected the two sections of Maspeth Avenue in Brooklyn and Queens just north of where English Kills and the East Branch merge. It was eliminated in the late 19th century, having been deemed an obstruction to navigation.

The minister of Ruthwell parish church in Dumfriesshire, he founded the world's first commercial savings bank. He served as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1839. He was also an author, publisher and philanthropist. Early life Duncan was born in 1774 at Lochrutton, Kirkcudbrightshire, where his father, George Duncan, was minister. As a boy he met the poet Robert Burns, who visited Lochrutton Manse. Duncan was educated in Dumfries at the Academy. After studying for two sessions at St. Andrews University he was sent to Liverpool to begin commercial life, and under the patronage of his relative, Dr. James Currie, the biographer of Robert Burns, his prospects of success were very fair; but his heart was not in business, and he soon left Liverpool to study at Edinburgh and Glasgow for the ministry of the Church of Scotland. Whilst in Edinburgh he joined the Speculative Society, and became intimate with the political figures, Francis Horner and Henry Brougham. Ministry and works In 1798 he was ordained as minister of the Church of Scotland and became Minister at Ruthwell in Dumfriesshire in 1799, where he spent the rest of his life. Duncan from the first was remarkable for the breadth of his views, especially in what concerned the welfare of the people, and the courage and ardour with which he promoted measures not usually thought to be embraced in the minister's r√¥le. In a time of scarcity he brought Indian corn from Liverpool. At the time when a French invasion was dreaded he raised a company of volunteers, of which he was the captain. He published a series of cheap popular tracts, contributing to the series some that were much prized, afterwards collected under the title The Cottage Fireside. He originated a newspaper, The Dumfries and Galloway Courier, of which he was editor for seven years. =Savings banks= The measure which is most honourably connected with Duncan's name was the institution of savings banks. The first savings bank was instituted at Ruthwell in 1810, and Duncan was unceasing in his efforts to promote the cause throughout the country. His influence was used to procure the first act of parliament passed to encourage such institutions. By speeches, lectures, and pamphlets he made the cause known far and wide. The scheme readily commended itself to all intelligent friends of the people, and the growing progress and popularity of the movement have received no check to the present day. Great though his exertions were, and large his outlay in this cause, he never received any reward or acknowledgement beyond the esteem of those who appreciated his work and the spirit in which it was done. In 1810 Duncan opened the world's first commercial savings bank, which would eventually form part of the Trustee Savings Bank, paying interest on its investors' modest savings. The bicentenary of this event was celebrated with a conference held by the Centre for Theology and Public Issues at the University of Edinburgh. Speakers investigated Duncan's legacy in light of current social, financial, and religious dynamics. The Savings Bank Museum tells the story of early home savings in Britain. =Other works= In 1823 Duncan received the degree of D.D. from the University of St. Andrews. In 1836 he published the first volume of a work which reached ultimately to four volumes, entitled The Sacred Philosophy of the Seasons. It was well received, and ran through several editions. To the Transactions of the Scottish Antiquarian Society he contributed a description of a celebrated runic cross: the Ruthwell Cross (now in Ruthwell church), one of the finest Anglo-Saxon crosses in Britain. This late 7th/early 8th century cross, which he discovered in his parish and restored in 1818, and on which volumes have since been written, is remarkable for its runic inscription, which contains excerpts from The Dream of the Rood, an Old English poem. He made a memorable contribution likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a paper to the Royal Society of Edinburgh describing the discovery of the fossil footmarks of four legged vertebrate animals in the Permian red sandstone of Corncockle Quarry, near Lochmaben.Duncan, H. 1831. An account of the tracks and footmarks of animals found impressed on sandstone in the quarry of Corncockle Muir, in Dunfreisshire. Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 11:194‚Äì209. The paper, published in 1831, was one of the first two scientific reports of a fossil track (the other being made by Mr. J. GriersonGrierson, J. 1928. On footsteps before the flood, in a specimen of res sandstone. Edinburgh Journal of Science, 8:130‚Äì134.). Duncan also corresponded with the palaeontologist Rev William Buckland about the tracks. A cast of the tracks of Chelichnus duncani can be found in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. The original fossils can be seen at Dumfries Museum. While at first not very decided between the moderate and the evangelical party in the church, Duncan soon sided with the latter, and became the intimate friend of such men as Dr. Chalmers and Dr. Andrew Thomson. In the earlier stages of the controversy connected with the Scottish church he addressed letters on the subject to his old college friends Lord Brougham and the Marquis of Lansdowne, and to Lord Melbourne, home secretary. In 1839 Duncan became Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and at the time of the Disruption of 1843 became one of the founding ministers of the Free Church of Scotland leaving a manse and grounds that had been rendered very beautiful by his taste and skill. Henry Duncan was visited by Robert Murray M'Cheyne during his vacations in Ruthwell. Duncan was a man of most varied accomplishments ‚Äì manual, intellectual, social, and spiritual. With the arts of drawing, modelling, sculpture, landscape-gardening, and even the business of an architect, he was familiar, and his knowledge of literature and science was varied and extensive. In private and family life he was highly estimable, while his ministerial work was carried on with great earnestness and delight. The stroke of paralysis that ended his life on 19 February 1846 fell on him while conducting a religious service in the cottage of an elder. Family Duncan's first wife whom he married in November 1804 was Agnes Craig, daughter of his predecessor, the Rev. John Craig. They had two sons and a daughter. Agnes Duncan died of influenza in 1832.Hall, Sophy: Dr Duncan of Ruthwell, Founder of Saving's Banks, by his great Granddaughter, Edinburgh: Oliphant, Anderson and Ferrier 1910. Duncan's second wife whom he married in 1836 was Mary Grey, daughter of George Grey of West Ord, sister of John Grey of Dilston, a well- known Northumbrian gentleman (see memoir by his daughter, Mrs. Josephine Butler) and Henry Grey (a minister), widow of the Rev. R. Lundie of Kelso, and mother of Mary Lundie Duncan and Jane Lundie Bonar. She was a lady of considerable accomplishments and force of character, and author of several books. Duncan's son George John Craig Duncan was born in 1806. He became the minister at Kirkpatrick Durham. His wife was Isabelle Wight Duncan who was a notable author.Stephen D. Snobelen, 'Duncan , Isabelle Wight (1812‚Äì1878)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 19 Nov 2015 His second son, William Wallace Duncan, born in 1808, was the minister of Cleish and husband of his step-sister Mary Lundie Duncan. Henry Duncan's daughter Barbara referred to by Thomas Carlyle as \\"the bonny little Barbara Duncan\\" married the Rev. James Dodds of Dunbar.

Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylized martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), tambourines and cymbals with small drums. Other folk instruments include the oud and rebaba, both string instruments, as well as the ney. Male-only folk music =Sea music= Pearl diving in the Persian Gulf Work songs relating to the sea are the most recurrent type of folk music, particularly songs pertaining to pearl hunting. Each song, varying in rhythm, would narrate a different activity of the pearling trip, including spreading the sails, diving, and rowing the ships. Collective singing was an integral part of each pearling trip, and each ship had a designated singer, known locally as al naham. Singing was used to encourage crew members to work harder during the pearling drip, in addition to providing entertainment while they were resting. =Dance= Ardah, a folkloric dance, is still practiced in Qatar. The dance is performed with two rows of men opposite of one another, each of whom may or may not be wielding a sword, and is accompanied by drums and spoken poetry. The two main types of ardah in the Persian Gulf states are land ardah (ardah barriyya) and sea ardah (ardah bahri). Qatar's ardah is a mixture of the two. In some performances, men wear land ardah attire at a beach setting and are supported by sea band drumming. Female-only folk music Women primarily sang work songs associated with daily activities such as wheat grinding and cooking. The songs were performed collectively in small groups and varied in specificity - some pertained to general themes, whereas others were related to specific processes. Women would also sing when returning pearl ships were sighted. After a sighting was made, they would gather around the seashore where they would clap and sing about the hardships of pearl diving.Abu Saud, p. 147 =Dance= Public performances by women were practiced only on two annual occasions. The first was al-moradah, which involved women and girls of all social classes gathering in a secluded area where they would sing and dance in embroidered clothes. This was usually done in the weeks preceding Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. It was one of the most popular musical practices among Qatari women in previous decades. Each moradah would begin with a prayer to Muhammad. After this, the women would praise tribal leaders and elders, repeating each verse twice before a new verse was introduced. It was performed with two rows of women opposite of each other with the lead singers at the far ends, thus forming a three-sided rectangle. Moradah's dance consisted of all the women in each row swaying their bodies and moving their arms up and down while their hands were interlaced. For the most part, the practice was abandoned during the 1950s, though it is still sometimes practiced at the end of weddings. There have been efforts by Qatar's ministry of culture to reintegrate the practice in Qatari society. The second occasion of collective public singing, known as al-ashori, was performed exclusively at weddings. There were two main instruments used during a performance: al daf, a type of tambourine and al tabl, a longtidunal drum. Thematically, ashori songs are cheerful as they rejoice the marriage which is taking place.Abu Saud, p. 149 The lyrics are derived from nabati verse, a type of Arabic poetry and were generally symbiotic in nature. Ashori is still practiced by some classes of Qatari society. Folk instruments Traditional Qatari male musicians Percussion instruments are most popular in Qatari folk music. Galahs, a tall clay jar, was commonly used as a musical instrument by pearl fishermen. Tin drinking cups known as tus or tasat were also used, usually in conjunction with a tabl, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick. Contemporary music Local music artists are subject to many barriers in Qatar, such as lack of awareness, high prices of recording studios and a deficiency of agents. =Music institutions= In August 1980, the Ministry of Information established a subsidiary organization to serve as a music academy, referring to it as \\"the Institute\\". An academy building was provided to the institute by the government and it began classes on 1 October, 1980 with an initial capacity for 20 aspiring musicians. Qatar Foundation was responsible for commissioning the Qatar Music Academy in Katara Cultural Village in January 2011. Although the academy's primary focal point is providing musical education for children and teenagers from 5 to 18 years old, it also provides education for individuals not falling within that age bracket through its 'music for all' program. =Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra= The Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra was formed in 2007 at the behest of Qatar Foundation with an initial budget of $14 million. Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi =Recording companies= The first Qatari record label was established in January, 2015 by Dana Al Fardan as DNA Records. =Arabic/gulf music= Many contemporary Qatari singers perform what is popularly known as khaliji ('gulf') music. Notable male artists in this genre include Fahad Al Kubaisi, the first artist out of the Arab states of the Persian Gulf to be nominated for a Grammy award, Essa Al Kubaisi, Ali Abdul Sattar, and Bader Al Rayes. =Metal/rock= Naser Mestarihi, a Qatari born Jordanian-Pakistani singer-songwriter and multi- instrumentalist became the first rock/metal musician to release an album out of Qatar. He was also a member of Qatar's first ever metal band Asgard Legionnaires. References Further reading * Bahrain and Qatar, being next to each other, in the past exchanged musicians continuously.

He is alleged to have acted as one of many financial facilitators of the September 11 attacks in the United States.The 9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (2004, P. 172) 9/11 Commission Report. However, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture which was publicly released on December 9, 2014, disclosed an internal CIA cable between the chief of interrogations and the CIA Headquarters wherein he expressed reservations regarding al-Hawsawi's alleged role and involvement in the plot. The report reveals \\"following al-Hawsawi's first interrogation session, Chief of Interrogations asked CIA Headquarters for information on what al-Hawsawi actually \\"knows,\\" saying: \\"he does not appear to the [sic] be a person that is a financial mastermind.\\" Mustafa al- Hawsawi was captured in Pakistan by Pakistani agents in March 2003 and was transferred to the custody of the United States. He was held in secret CIA black sites until September 2006, when he was transferred to Guant√°namo Bay and U.S. officials finally acknowledged his imprisonment. It detained him at the Salt Pit, a secret black site in Afghanistan. It was reported in August 2010 that, after months of interrogation, the CIA transferred al-Hawsawi and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo Bay detention camp on September 24, 2003, for indefinite detention. Fearing that Rasul v. Bush, a pending Supreme Court case about detainees' habeas corpus rights, might result in having to provide the men with access to counsel, the CIA took back custody on March 27, 2004, and transported the four men to one of their black sites. It has long been known that, during al-Hawsawi's CIA captivity, his captors injured him, causing him to suffer from anal fissures, chronic hemorrhoids and, most seriously, symptomatic rectal prolapse. When the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published a 600 page unclassified summary of its 6,000 page report on the CIA's use of torture the world learned that the CIA routinely punished its captives by sodomizing them, claiming the sodomy was the long abandoned medical technique of rectal feeding. The United States Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation of the CIA's Torture Program revealed that detainees were routinely subjected to unnecessary rectal exams without evidence of medical necessity for purposes of behavioral control.\\"Report of the Senate Select Committee On Intelligence Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program Together with Foreword by Chairman Feinstein and Additional and Minority Views (2014, P. 100, n. 584)\\" (PDF). United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. December 9, 2014. CIA leadership, including General Counsel Scott Muller and DDO James Pavitt, were alerted to allegations that rectal exams were conducted with \\"excessive force\\" on two detainees at DETENTION SITE COBALT. CIA records indicate that one of the detainees, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse. Al-Hawsawi was transferred from CIA custody to military custody at Guantanamo on September 6, 2006. The Bush administration was then confident of passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which restricted detainee use of habeas corpus, and prohibited them from using the federal court system. (This provision was ruled unconstitutional in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) and numerous habeas corpus petitions were refiled in federal courts.)  Background  Although it is alleged that al-Hawsawi was a member of al- Qaeda, he stated in a Combatant Status Review Hearing that he is not a member of al-Qaeda, and never swore an oath of allegiance to Osama bin Laden. (p. 21-22) Al-Hawsawi was charged with being in the United Arab Emirates starting in April 2001, and with assisting at least one would be hijacker with travel arrangements to the United States.http://www.mc.mil/Portals/0/pdfs/KSM2/KSM%20II%20(Sworn%20Charges).pdf On September 11, 2001, al-Hawsawi travelled from the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan.>\\"Verbatim Transcript of Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing for ISN 10011\\"(p. 27) Al-Hawsawi said that he first learned of the 9/11 operation following the attacks and was surprised by the size of the 9/11 operation. Al- Hawsawi's arrest on March 1, 2003, in Pakistan was unrelated to any reporting from CIA detainees.\\"Report of the Senate Select Committee On Intelligence Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program Together with Foreword by Chairman Feinstein and Additional and Minority Views (2014, P. 188, n. 1106)\\" (PDF).

The CIA maintained a detention and interrogation site there. This was not confirmed by U.S. officials.Mustafa al-Hawsawi\\" , Cageprisoners  CIA custody  Al-Hawsawi was held in secret CIA custody, for several years. When the United States Senate Intelligence Committee published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,000 page classified report on the CIA's use of torture, it became known that al- Hawsawi was held in several CIA black sites during his years in secret detention, where he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques which amounted to torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. In particular, the report revealed that: * Al-Hawsawi had been held in detention site COBALT, believed to be situated in Afghanistan, in 2003.\\"confidential report of the International Committee of the Red Cross following its visit to fourteen \\"high value detainees\\" transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006\\", 14 February 2007 There he was subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, including water dousing without the approval from CIA headquarters and to rectal examinations conducted with \\"excessive force\\", leading to a diagnosis of chronic hemorrhoids, anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse; * During his detention in detention site VIOLET, believed to be located in Lithuania,\\"Europe: Breaking The Conspiracy Of Silence: Usa‚Äôs European ‚ÄòPartners In Crime‚Äô Must Act After Senate Torture Report\\", page 16 al-Hawsawi required emergency medical care, but officers denied him access to a local hospital. Moreover, the findings of the Senate Report raised doubts about Al- Hawsawi's detention, identifying him as one of a number of individuals who were detained under the CIA's program \\"despite doubts and questions surrounding [his] knowledge of terrorist threats and the location of senior al-Qa'ida leadership\\". In fact, after his first interrogation, the Chief of Interrogations wrote to CIA Headquarters saying that al-Hawsawi \\"does not appear to the [sic] be a person that is a financial mastermind.\\"  Questions from Salim Ahmed Hamdan's defense attorney  On April 23, 2008, attorneys working on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan requested permission to meet with Abdulmalik Mohammed and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Hamdan's attorneys had previously requested permission to get the \\"high-value detainees\\" to answer written questions. They believed the men would confirm that if Hamdan played a role in al Qaeda, it had been a peripheral one. Abdulmalik Mohammed and Mustafa al- Hawsawi declined to answer the questions, because they said they had no way to know that the questions purporting to be from Hamdan's attorneys were not a ruse. Andrea J. Prasow requested permission for Lieutenant Commander Brian Mizer to meet in person with the two men to try to assure them that the questions were not a ruse, and would not be shared with their interrogators.  Military commission trial  In June 2008, al-Hawsawi and four other \\"high- value detainees\\" (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Ammar al-Baluchi and Walid Bin Attash) were charged with crimes brought before the Guantanamo military commission. The charges included 2,973 individual counts of murder, one for each person killed in the September 11 attacks, as well as conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, terrorism, and providing material support for terrorism. The judge ordered al-Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh to undergo mental competency hearings. On December 8, 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to confess and plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after the competency hearings for al- Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh, so that all five men could make their plea together. The charges against all five were dismissed on January 21, 2010, before a plea was entered. In May 2009, Al Arabiya reported that Montasser al-Zayyat, a prominent Saudi Arabian attorney, had been invited to defend al-Hawsawi. Al Zayat described suspecting, at first, that he was the target of a hoax. On August 31, 2009, Corrections One, a trade journal for the prison industry, proclaimed that \\"Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi\\" was one of ten captives they speculated might be moved to a maximum security prison in Standish, Michigan.  Official status reviews  Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. = Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants = Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.

United States Senate Torture Report On December 9, 2014, a redacted executive summary of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture was publicly released. This executive summary revealed the following information regarding al-Hawsawi's torture: *He was subjected to rectal examinations conducted with excessive force and was later diagnosed with chronic hemorrhoids, an anal fissure, and symptomatic rectal prolapse. *He was subjected to water dousing without approval from CIA Headquarters in a manner that was indistinguishable from waterboarding.\\"Report of the Senate Select Committee On Intelligence Committee Study of the Central Intelligence Agency's Detention and Interrogation Program Together with Foreword by Chairman Feinstein and Additional and Minority Views (2014, P. 106)\\" (PDF).

December 9, 2014  Amnesty International, USA Campaign  On December 7, 2015, Amnesty International, USA launched a campaign to raise awareness regarding al-Hawsawi's military commission trial, which they alleged violates international fair trial standards by frustrating the truth seeking process by impeding transparency and denying accountability for torture.Amnesty International, USA, , Torture Survivor Facing Unfair Treatment  Human Rights bodies' criticism of al-Hawsawi's detention  = UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention = On January 23, 2015, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention held that al-Hawsawi's ongoing detention in Guant√°namo Bay was arbitrary, and in contravention of articles 9 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and 9 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\"Opinions adopted by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention at its seventy-first session (17‚Äì21 November 2014) No. 50/2014 (United States of America and Cuba)\\", 13 February 2015 = Inter- American Commission on Human Rights = On July 7, 2015, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on precautionary measures regarding al-Hawsawi requesting the United States of America, inter alia, to adopt the necessary measures to protect the life and personal integrity of al- Hawsawi, and to adopt the necessary measures to ensure access to medical care and treatment.\\"Inter-American Commission on Human Rights: Resolution 24/2015\\", 7 July 2015  Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment  On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts.

He is the author, co- author, editor, or co-editor of more than fifty books, mainly on British and American maritime history and naval warfare. In 2005, the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings described him as \\"one of the most widely known and well-respected naval historians in the world.\\"U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings, vol. 130/12/1,222 (December 2005), p. 64 In reference to his work on the history of naval strategy, an academic in Britain termed him the \\"doyen of US naval educators.\\"Beatrice Heuser, The Evolution of Strategy: Thinking War from Antiquity to the Present (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 287 A Dutch scholar went further to say that Hattendorf \\"may rightly be called one of the most influential maritime historians in the world.\\"Gijs Rommelse, Review of Stratgey and the Sea in Tijdschrift voor Zeegeschiedenis, no. 1 (2017), pp. 84-86, quotation on p. 84.

He has called maritime history \\"a subject that touches on both the greatest moments of the human spirit as well as on the worst, including war.\\" In 2011, the Naval War College announced the establishment of the Hattendorf Prize for Distinguished Original Research in Maritime History, named for him. Naval War College Press Release, 20 October 2011 The 2014 Oxford Naval Conference - \\"Strategy and the Sea\\" - celebrated his distinguished career on April 10‚Äì12, 2014. The proceedings of the conference were published as a festschrift. In March 2016, Hattendorf received the higher doctorate of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Oxford. Among the few Americans to have received such designation, Hattendorf remained actively engaged on the Naval War College campus after his formal retirement in 2016. Remaining in scholarly service as the Ernest J. King Professor Emeritus of Maritime History at the Naval War College, Hattendorf continued guiding discussions about the role of future history in understanding contemporary strategic problems in the global maritime arena. Recognizing his contributions in the fields of maritime history and naval strategy, the President of the Naval War College, Rear Admiral Jeffrey Harley, established the \\"John B. Hattendorf Center for Maritime Historical Research\\" in the summer of 2017. The Hattendorf Historical Center performs the mission of supporting future history requirements in Professional Military Education through original documentary research, scholarly publications, public education programming, and direct support to the seagoing forces of the U.S. Navy. As history is largely unclassified, the Hattendorf Historical Center also provides historical foundations for contemporary discussion in the interest of facilitating international partnerships in the global maritime commons. Family, education, and early life Hattendorf was born and raised in the village of Western Springs, Illinois. He is a ninth great-grandson (eleventh generation descendant) of Elder William Brewster of the Plymouth Colony.General Society of Mayflower Descendants number 82629 RI; Sons of the American Revolution No. 173386, RI No. 1730 His interest in the ships and the sea stemmed from summers spent at his family cottage at Portage Point, Michigan, where he was a sailing instructor on Portage Lake from 1958 to 1964. After graduating in the Class of 1960 from Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, Illinois, he earned his bachelor's degree in history in 1964 from Kenyon College, where he was inspired by Charles Ritcheson and Richard G. Salomon. In 1970, he graduated from the Frank C. Munson Institute of American Maritime History at Mystic Seaport, where he studied under Robert G. Albion and Benjamin W. Labaree. He earned his master's degree in history from Brown University in 1971, completing his thesis under the tutelage of A. Hunter Dupree on the history of strategic thinking and war gaming at the Naval War College. In 1979, he completed his doctorate at Pembroke College, Oxford with a thesis on English Grand Strategy in the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702‚Äì12, supervised by N. H. Gibbs and complemented by studies under Ragnhild Hatton, Sir Michael Howard and Piers Mackesy.Michael Duffy, \\"Piers Gerald Mackesy (1924-2014),\\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy, vol.

Naval career After graduation from Kenyon College, he served his country in uniform for eight years during the Vietnam War period, as a naval officer. He served on board USS O'Brien (DD-725), earning a commendation from the Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for outstanding performance of duty during combat operations in April 1967. Later, he served at sea in USS Purdy (DD-734) and USS Fiske (DD-842). While in the U.S. Navy, Hattendorf also served ashore at the Naval History Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (Op-09B9), in Washington, D.C. in 1967‚Äì69, where he was first trained in naval history under Rear Admiral Ernest M. Eller and Dr. William J. Morgan, and at the Naval War College in 1972‚Äì73, where he served as speech writer and research assistant to Vice Admiral Stansfield Turner and also taught in the college's strategy and policy department.Talking About Naval History, p. x Civilian academic career Hattendorf has spent most of his civilian academic career at the United States Naval War College, returning there as a civilian faculty member in 1977. He taught Strategy and Policy for a number of years. From 1988 to 2003, he directed the United States Naval War College's Advanced Research Department. In 2003, Hattendorf became the first chairman of the Naval War College's newly established Maritime History Department, where he oversaw its research section and also the director of the Naval War College Museum. He retired in September 2016 and was promoted to Ernest J. King Professor Emeritus of Maritime History. He identified four primary audiences for the U.S. Navy's maritime history programs: sailors, Navy leaders, government policymakers, and the American people. \\"The Uses of Maritime History in and for the Navy,\\" Naval War College Review, (April 2003) As a civilian scholar, he has been visiting professor of history at the National University of Singapore and at the German Armed Forces Military History Research Office, a senior associate member of St Antony's College, Oxford, and a visiting Fellow at Pembroke College, Oxford.

Hattendorf"},{"id":"989573","text":"Joshua Charles Malina (born January 17, 1966) is an American film and stage actor known for playing Will Bailey on the NBC drama The West Wing, Jeremy Goodwin on Sports Night, David Rosen on Scandal, and President Siebert on The Big Bang Theory. Early life and education Malina was born in New York City. His parents, Fran and Robert Malina, were founding members of Young Israel of Scarsdale in New Rochelle, where he grew up. His father was an attorney, investment banker and Broadway producer. The actor has commented that while the name \\"Malina\\" does not sound Jewish to most people and often leads them to assume he is Latino (often due to confusion of \\"Malina\\" with the Spanish surname Molina), the name is Polish-Jewish in origin, from the \\"Polish [word] for 'raspberry.'\\"Alan Pergament. \\"'West Wing' speechwriter addresses celebrity politics,\\" The Buffalo News (NY), September 13, 2005, page E7. Malina attended middle school at Westchester Day School and high school at the Horace Mann School. He earned a B.A. in Theater from Yale University. At Yale, he was a member of The Spizzwinks, an a cappella group, together with fellow actor Noah Emmerich.  Career  = Theatre = He made his acting debut in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men, and later in the play's run moved into a major role. Malina had contacted Sorkin initially at the suggestion of his parents when he first went to New York City, as they knew Sorkin was a high-school classmate and friend of Malina's cousins. The cousins, in turn, had spoken highly of Malina to Sorkin, who suggested he audition for the play.Rick Kushman. \\"White house rookie ‚Äì Joshua Malina rode the inside track to NBC's 'West Wing,'\\" The Sacramento Bee, March 2, 2003, page TK24. Malina has joked in interviews that Sorkin's casting him in subsequent productions may owe to the fact that he once performed the Heimlich maneuver on Sorkin, saving his life, when the writer began to choke while eating a hamburger at a bowling match with the cast of the play.Kevin D. Thompson. \\"A familiar face, a singular faith,\\" Palm Beach Post, November 30, 2005, page 1E. He has since appeared in many Sorkin film and TV projects. = Film and television = Malina's first job in the film business was as a production assistant on the Chevy Chase comedy Fletch Lives, an ill-received sequel to the star's hit movie Fletch. His first on-screen appearance was a three-line, five-word role in the film version of A Few Good Men, where he has said he appreciated the dedication that star Jack Nicholson showed by performing his lines in the scene himself even though his character was off screen and could easily have been played for him by a crew member. In his next film, Sorkin's The American President, Malina had a somewhat larger role as assistant to Annette Bening's environmental-activist character.Charlie Patton. \\"ABC's 'Sports Night' hard to categorize, but very enjoyable,\\" The Florida Times-Union. November 10, 1998, page C5. Malina played two different characters over four episodes on the talk-show satire The Larry Sanders Show. He appeared first in 1993 as Robert Brody, a fictional reporter for the real- life magazine Entertainment Weekly, to whom actor John Ritter gives a scathing interview after having his appearance in the show cancelled to make room for musician Warren Zevon to play a second song (episode: \\"Off Camera\\"). Five years later, Malina returned in a recurring role as Kenny Mitchell, a sleazy network executive who pushes Larry Sanders out of the show in favor of Jon Stewart. From 1998‚Äì2000, Malina starred as character Jeremy Goodwin on Sorkin's Sports Night, a show that attracted him from the moment Sorkin sent him the pilot script. The Goodwin character began as a research analyst, but was promoted to associate producer by the second season, creating a larger role for Malina.Sylvia Rubin. \\"Malina gets into the swing of \`Sports Night' - but critically acclaimed show may need a ratings boost to survive second season,\\" The San Francisco Chronicle, October 5, 1999, page B1. The critically acclaimed show was unable to find a large fan base and was canceled after two seasons, with some critics saying the show's troubles were exacerbated by having to share Sorkin's time with his concurrent project on rival network NBC, The West Wing. The actor counts Sports Night among his most popular roles and noted on the occasion of the show's 10th-anniversary DVD release, \\"If my straw poll of who stops me to say what is any indication, West Wing may only slightly edge Sports Night.\\"David Barron. \\"New on DVD ‚Äì Sports Night 10th anniversary edition available ‚Äì ABC series is credited with changing much about sit-coms,\\" Houston Chronicle, October 7, 2008, \\"Star\\" section, page 4.

His character initially was perceived by the public as an attempt to replace departing series star Rob Lowe,No author. \\"Delightful addition to 'West Wing' madhouse,\\" The Star-Ledger (Newark, NJ), February 20, 2003, page 34: \\"'Someone on the internet referred to me as \\"that horrible little man who's replacing Rob Lowe,\\" which is hurtful, because I think of myself as a delightful little man,' Malina said.\\" although Malina said in numerous interviews that the two actors and characters were too dissimilar to be viewed as anything but a change. During his tenure on The West Wing, Malina was known to the rest of the cast as a tireless prankster. It is said he coated telephones with Vaseline and reset producer Alex Graves's iPod menus to Mandarin Chinese.Gag Order, Josh Malina's Prank-Related Campaign of Terror, http://www.empireonline.com/west-wing/joshmalina.html He stole some of Bradley Whitford's letterhead stationery and used it in an elaborate prank. At the suggestion of co-star Janel Moloney, Malina sent a $200 Valentine's Day bouquet to season-six newcomer Jimmy Smits that included a card crafted on Whitford's stolen letterhead stating: \\"Jimmy, You are a delight. I enjoyed every moment we've had together. Be my Valentine.\\"Transcript of Joshua Malina's personal appearance , Jewish Student Union of the University of Florida, Reitz Union Grand Ballroom, March 23, 2005. Retrieved Jan. 1, 2009. Following the end of The West Wing, Malina campaigned for the leading role of Danny Tripp in Sorkin's next TV project, Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip, but the role went instead to Whitford. When the show was cancelled in its first season, Malina was teased by some in the industry who suggested he was Sorkin's good luck charm, but he pointed to Sorkin's upcoming film Charlie Wilson's War as evidence his friend could succeed without him.Heather Salerno. \\"Meet the 'Big Shot': Joshua Malina,\\" The Journal News (Westchester County, NY), September 24, 2007, page 1D. In 2007, Malina became one of the four stars of the short-lived ABC dramedy Big Shots. His character, Karl Mixworthy, was a pharmaceutical company executive juggling a wife and a mistress, who meet when the jilted lover tries to expose him to his wife but befriends her instead.Jamie Gumbrecht. \\"Lineup creates TiVo nightmare,\\" Lexington Herald- Leader (Lexington, KY; reprinted from The Seattle Times), September 13, 2007, page F2. Malina is a co-creator and producer of Bravo's cable TV series Celebrity Poker Showdown. In private life, he is an avid poker player, having played with Sorkin while on Broadway, used poker winnings to pay his rent early in his career,Jonathan Storm. \\"Stars sweeten the pot as Bravo bets on TV poker,\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 2, 2003, page F01.Heather Salerno. \\"Lucky guy,\\" The Journal News, November 30, 2003, page 1E. and organized a cast-and-crew game that lasted the full duration of Sports Night and occasionally delayed the start of shooting. The idea for the show came from a weekly high-stakes poker game hosted by Hank Azaria, which Malina and friend Andrew Hill Newman attended. From 2011 to 2019, Malina appeared as Pres. Siebert on The Big Bang Theory. In 2012, Malina held a recurring role on ABC's Scandal as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Rosen. He was promoted to a series regular for season 2. Malina co-hosted the podcast The West Wing Weekly with Hrishikesh Hirway. The series debuted in March 2016, and ended in January 2020. =Philanthropy= In 2004, Malina was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured \\"film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community\\" and included Greg Grunberg, Marlee Matlin, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman.Jewish Federations of North America: \\"Film and Television Celebrities Promote Jewish Federations in First-Ever National Television Advertising Campaign - Jewish Stars Promote Federations' Initiatives and Mission\\" August 2, 2004.

Reimer is a Progressive Conservative politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba (MLA) from 1990 to 2007, and served in the government of Gary Filmon. The son of Jacob Frank Reimer, a Russian immigrant, he grew up in East Kildonan where his father owned a service station and he graduated from Miles MacDonell Collegiate. Reimer has a degree in sociology from the University of North Dakota. Before entering politics, he was a marketing and management instructor for Imperial Oil, and worked in the automobile and tourism industries in Manitoba. He also owned a restaurant and service station. Reimer has received a Mayor's Award for Leadership and Service to the Winnipeg community, as well as a Certificate of Merit from the government of Canada. He married Joan McAdam. Reimer was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 general election, defeating Liberal candidate Linda Asper in the southeastern Winnipeg riding of Niakwa, 4950 votes to 4301. He was re-elected by a wider margin in 1995, in a period when provincial Liberal fortunes were on the decline (the New Democratic Party (NDP) does not have a strong historical presence in this section of Winnipeg). On May 9, 1995, Reimer was appointed Minister of Urban Affairs and Minister of Housing in Gary Filmon's government. He retained these portfolios until the Progressive Conservative government was defeated in 1999. Reimer himself was easily re-elected in the 1999 election, defeating his NDP opponent by over 2500 votes in the renamed Southdale riding. In the 2003 election, Reimer was re-elected by 1299 votes over his 26-year-old NDP opponent, Carolyn Frost. He held several critic positions while an opposition MLA. Reimer opposed efforts by the Manitoba government to provide safe injection paraphernalia to drug addicts, arguing instead for a zero-tolerance policy in such matters. He also criticized the expansion of a casino economy in the province. He lost his seat to his NDP challenger, former journalist Erin Selby, in the 2007 provincial election.

Five variations exist: *three variations in the style of ice hockey *two variations in the style of bandy, one of which is called floorball in English speaking regions. Two of these variations involve the use of wheeled skates and are categorized as roller sports under the title of roller hockey. Quad hockey uses quad skates and looks similar to bandy, while inline hockey uses inline skates and is of the ice hockey variation. All styles and codes are played on dry, flat floor surfaces such as a gymnasium or basketball court. As in other hockey codes, players on each team attempt to shoot a ball or puck into a goal using sticks, usually with a curved end.‚ÄúFloor Hockey Rules,‚Äù Floor hockey games differ from street hockey in that the games are more structured, and two use wheeled skates. The variations which do not involve wheeled skates are sometimes used for training children to play ice hockey and bandy in a training format known as dryland training. History Floor hockey codes derived from ice hockey were first officially played in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1875, but the game's official creation is credited to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame inductee, Samuel Perry Jacks, better known as \\"Sam Jacks\\". Jacks is the individual credited with both the creation of the official skateless game derived from ice hockey and codifying its first set of rules in 1936. At the time, Jacks was working as assistant physical director at the West End YMCA in Toronto. His achievement was later recognized by the United Nations. Floor hockey is a physical fitness sport in many public schools for physical education class.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Academic Edition, s.v. ‚ÄúIce Hockey‚Äù A version of ringette was introduced as a sport in the Winter Special Olympics in 1932. In 1970, the Special Olympics added team floor hockey as an event, with the distinction of it being the only team sport under its purview. The Canadian Ball Hockey Association (CBHA) was formed in 1991 to provide more formal leagues of ball-based floor hockey. The CBHA runs leagues for men, women, and juniors, and organizes National Championships for each division. In 2003, the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association Hockey Committee released a baseline set of rules for intramural floor hockey for college campuses across the United States. Equipment Floor hockey equipment differs between each code. Some codes use an indoor puck, a ring made of felt or other material ( Gym Ringette ) while others use a lightweight plastic ball, or a heavier ball. Some codes require standard ice hockey, field hockey or bandy sticks, while others use lightweight plastic. In gym ringette plastic bladeless sticks are used while the Special Olympics version of floor hockey uses wooden ones. The types of checking and protective equipment allowed also vary. Variations One variation, especially popular in Europe, is floorball. Floorball uses a lightweight plastic ball and sticks made of plastic and carbon fiber. Limited checking is permitted. Another variation, cosom hockey, uses plastic sticks and pucks, while gym ringette uses circular rings and sticks with no blade. Power hockey is a floor hockey game similar to floorball that has been designed for players using electric wheelchairs. Knee pads are required for the goal keeper  Rules  Although floor hockey is made up of several different codes, there are some basic rules which are typically followed regardless of code. With the exception of gym ringette, games start with a face-off, where a player from each team have an equal chance to gain possession. The face-off is also used to resume play after goals, and to start each period. A goal is scored when the entire puck or ball crosses the plane of the goal line, unless it is intentionally kicked in by the attacking team. The team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner. If the game is tied, the games usually proceed into golden goal period(s) in order to determine a winner. Overtime rules vary, but typically include extra time and/or penalty shootout. Penalties for illegal actions are enforced. A player committing a major infraction is required to sit out of the game for two minutes, resulting a power play, but a minor infraction may result in a free hit. Penalties are typically given for the following actions: * Tripping ‚Äì Using the body or stick to intentionally cause a player to fall * Hooking ‚Äì Using the curved end of the stick to impede a player's forward progress by pulling him or her back * Slashing ‚Äì Using the stick to hit an opposing player's body * Interference ‚Äì Using the body to move a player from his current position on the floor or preventing him from playing the ball or puck * High Sticking ‚Äì Allowing the curved end of the stick to come above your waist * Pushing Down ‚Äì Using the stick to push an opponent down * Checking from behind ‚Äì Hitting a player from behind * Cross-checking ‚Äì ramming opponent with stick using both hands * Too many players on court - to be served by designated player * Spearing ‚Äì stabbing opponent with stick blade (game misconduct) * Deliberate intent to injure opponents (game misconduct) Due to the limited padding worn by players, body checking is typically disallowed in floor hockey games,‚ÄúNIRSA Floor Hockey Basics,‚Äù Last modified 2010, The National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association, although shoulder-to-shoulder checking is allowed.

The Paraguayan polka comes from polka of Czech origin; that was danced for the first time in Asunci√≥n, on November 27, 1858.http://www.abc.com.py/edicion-impresa/suplementos/escolar/resena-de- nuestra-polka-paraguaya-921167.html The guarania was created by the Paraguayan musician Jos√© Asunci√≥n Flores, in January 1925, after experiencing different arrangements with the old Paraguayan musical theme \\"Ma'er√£pa reikuaase\\".http://www.ultimahora.com/el-dia-que-nacian-jose-asuncion-flores-y- la-guarania-n1104438.html The polka presents numerous variations on a similar rhythmic pattern, which are known as: Polka song, Galopa, Polka valseada, Polka pop√≥, Polka jekutu, Polka kyre'y, Polka syryry, Purah√©i jahe'o, Kyre'y, Chamam√©, among other. Another rhythm created by the fusion of rhythms is called \\"Avanzada\\", which in 1977 was elaborated by the Paraguayan musician Oscar Nelson Safu√°n.http://www.portalguarani.com/1476_oscar_nelson_safuan.html The modern rhythms reached Paraguay in the 50s, with the importation of electronic instruments that began to use dance orchestras.http://www.portalguarani.com/1080_luis_szaran/12838_orquestas_y_conjuntos_populares__por_luis_szaran.html Mainly in the 1970s, latin music, rock music, pop, dance, protest song, cumbia, among others, were developed. Currently there is also a growing scene of latin music, folklore, hiphop, blues music, jazz, rock, electronic music, ethnic, reggae, and other genres. Folk music The Paraguayan polka combines ternary and binary rhythms, where as the European only uses binary. The most famous style of music is Guarania, created by the Paraguayan musician Jos√© Asunci√≥n Flores in 1926. The Guarania accomplishes this by using a combination of slow rhythms and melodies of melancholia character. Other popular genres of traditional music in Paraguay are the zarzuela and the \\"Paraguayan Songs\\", which are derived from the Paraguayan polka.South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2) Publisher: Routledge; Har/Com edition (October 1, 1998) Examples of Paraguayan Guarania are Juan B. Mora ‚Äì Imposible, Duo √ëamandu ‚Äì Che Rope'a Vype, Lorenzo Perez ‚Äì Mi Dicha Lejana, Los Indianos ‚Äì Mis Noches Sin Ti and others.The greatest influence outside Paraguay was Lu√≠s Alberto del Paran√° y su Tr√≠o Los Paraguayos. There was a time in the 1950s when most of the LP's of Latin American music in the shops in London were by that group.The guaran√≠a mentioned above is a slow-to-medium style. The more lively music is called \\"polka paraguaya\\". Both styles are based on the rhythm\\" ONE2345- ONE2345-\\" Paraguayan songs tend to be sung in Guaran√≠ or a mixture of Guaran√≠ and Spanish. Music of a strongly Paraguayan character is also heard in the Argentine provinces of Misiones, Florida and Corrientes, across the River Paran√° from Paraguay itself. =Instruments= The Spanish guitar (not from Paraguay) and European harp are among the most popular instruments, while dances include the lively polka and distinctive bottle dance, which involves the performer twirling a bottle around her head. Composer and guitarist Agust√≠n Barrios is perhaps the country's best known export. Paraguayan harp The Paraguayan harp deserves special mention as a popular instrument with a national style associated with it. The harp in South America dates back to at least 1556‚Äì1557, possibly as early as the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced to Paraguay by Jesuit priests who came to evangelise (the native population of indigenous Guaranis) and founded many missions, called \\"reducciones\\" . It was frequently used in church music in place of the organ or harpsichord. The Paraguayan harp is the national instrument of Paraguay, its shape and size were consolidated in the early 20th century by interpreter and composer Felix Perez Cardozo, who composed some of the most memorable pieces for the Paraguayan harp. It stands about 1.5 metres (5 ft) high and is very light and portable. The sound box is made of cedro (a type of mahogany) and pine. It is played either in a sitting position, or standing up when it is fitted with extending legs. The harp has 36 or 37 strings, which go through the centre of the neck making it identical from either side, this being a unique characteristic of the Paraguayan harp. The lower strings were once made from the leather of the belly of horses and the upper strings of steel but now they are all made of nylon. The original wooden pegs have mostly been replaced by mechanical pegs like those on the guitar, making them easier to tune. It has no pedals and is a diatonic instrument, which limits much of the traditional music to a major key and its related minor. There are however several methods of making semitones. One is to shorten the strings at the lower end by pushing a small peg between the strings. Another method is to shorten the strings at the top end by means of a metal key which is held between the fingers of the dominant hand. However, more recently, harps have begun to be constructed with the addition of levers to overcome this limitation, and many players are now using levered harps.Paraguay 200 years of Independence in the Heart of South America. R.Munro 2010 Popular music =Rock= Some of the popular music in Paraguay are influenced by the local polka. Rock is a popular genre in the Paraguayan music scene. Former President Alfredo Stroessner established a dictatorship and oppressed freedom of expression during his term between 1954 and 1989. Rock band Aftermad's (Los Aftermad's) and Los Blue Caps were formed during this time in the 1970s, and until the end of the dictatorship of Stroessner in 1989, a new rock scene started. New rock band such as Flou, Revolber, Ripe Banana Skins, Area 69, Paiko, Berta Rojas, The Force were formed. 21st century Paraguayan rock scene is supported by rock festivals such as \\"Pilsen Rock\\" and \\"Quilmes Rock\\". =Jazz= There is a small but vibrant jazz community in Paraguay. Key players include: Palito Miranda (alto sax), Remigio Pereira (trombone), Victor \\"Toti\\" Morel (drums), Oswal Gonzalez (drums), Riolo Alvarenga (drums), Jorge \\"Lobito\\" Martinez (piano), Carlos Schvartzman (guitar), Carlos Centuri√≥n (piano), Gustavo Viera (guitar), Eduardo \\"Tato\\" Zilli (bass), Nene Salerno (bass), Ariel Burgos (bass), Victor Morel Jr. (drums), German Lema (organ), Jose Villamayor (guitar), Bruno Mu√±oz (tenor and alto saxophone) and others. Classical music The main exponents are Agust√≠n Barrios Mangor√©, Jos√© Asunci√≥n Flores and Juan Carlos Moreno. Silva studied abroad and reproduced, in the guarani vocal form, the indigenous music, based on the European technique.

He served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 1989 to 1992 and 1999 to 2012. He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Dublin North-West constituency from 1989 to 2002.

During the IRA Border Campaign, he was arrested while training other IRA members in Glencree in May 1956. He served seven months in Mountjoy Prison and was then interned at the Curragh Camp.Hanley, Brian, and Millar, Scott (2009). The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party. Dublin: Penguin Ireland. p. 17 He worked in his family's fruit and vegetable shop, and later was employed as a postman and an encyclopaedia salesman. Political activities and career He took the Official Sinn F√©in side in the 1970 split. In 1977, he contested his first general election for the party, which that year was renamed Sinn F√©in ‚Äì The Workers' Party (in 1982 the name changed again to the Workers' Party). He was successful on his third attempt, and was elected at the February 1982 general election as a Sinn F√©in ‚Äì The Workers' Party TD for the Dublin North-West constituency. He retained his seat until the 2002 general election when he stood down in order to devote more time to his work in the European Parliament. In 1988, De Rossa succeeded Tom√°s Mac Giolla as president of the Workers' Party. The party had been growing steadily in the 1980s, and had its best-ever electoral performance in the general and European elections held in 1989. The party won 7 D√°il seats with 5% of the vote. De Rossa himself was elected to the European Parliament for the Dublin constituency, where he topped the poll and the party almost succeeded in replacing Fine Gael as the capital's second-largest party. However, the campaign resulted in a serious build-up of financial debt by the Workers' Party, which threatened to greatly inhibit the party's ability to ensure it would hold on to its gains. Long-standing tensions within the Workers' Party, pitting reformers, including most of the party's TDs, against hard-liners centred on former general secretary Se√°n Garland, came to a head in 1992. Disagreements on policy issues were exacerbated by the desire of the reformers to ditch the democratic centralist nature of the party structures, and to remove any remaining questions about alleged party links with the Official IRA, a topic which had been the subject of persistent and embarrassing media coverage. De Rossa called a Special Ardfheis (party conference) to debate changes to the constitution. The motion failed to get the required two-thirds majority, and subsequently De Rossa led the majority of the parliamentary group and councillors out of a meeting of the party's Central Executive Committee the following Saturday at Wynn's Hotel, splitting the party. De Rossa and the other former Workers' Party members then established a new political party, provisionally called New Agenda. At its founding conference in March 1992, it was named Democratic Left and De Rossa was elected party leader. Later that year he resigned his European Parliament seat, in favour of Democratic Left general secretary Des Geraghty. Following the collapse of the Fianna F√°il‚ÄìLabour Party coalition government in 1994, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left negotiated a government programme for the remaining life of the 27th D√°il, which became known as the 'Rainbow Coalition'. De Rossa became Minister for Social Welfare. He initiated Ireland's first national anti-poverty strategy, a commission on the family, and a commission to examine national pension policy. The 1997 general election resulted in the defeat of the outgoing coalition. At this point, Democratic Left had accumulated a very significant financial debt. In light of the co- operation achieved in practically all policy areas during the Rainbow Coalition, the party decided to merge with the Labour Party. Labour leader Ruairi Quinn became leader of the unified party; De Rossa took up the symbolic post of party president, which he held until 2002. In 1999, De Rossa was elected at the European Parliament election for the Dublin constituency. He was re-elected at the 2004 European Parliament election. De Rossa did not contest his D√°il seat at the 2002 general election. As a member of the European Parliament, De Rossa took a strong pro-integration approach from a distinctly social democratic perspective, as well as a keen interest in foreign policy and social policy. He originally joined the Communist and Allies group before transferring to the PES, and then to the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D;) group. De Rossa was a member of the European Convention which produced the July 2003 draft European constitution. De Rossa was chair of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council. He was a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Conference of Delegation Chairs, and a substitute member of the Committee on Development and the delegation to the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. On 16 January 2012, he announced his decision to resign as an MEP, and stepped down on 1 February. Libel action During De Rossa's period as leader of Democratic Left, Irish journalist Eamon Dunphy, writing in the Sunday Independent newspaper, published an article alleging that De Rossa was aware, while a member of the Workers' Party, of the Official IRA's alleged illegal activities, including bank robberies and forgery. De Rossa sued the newspaper for libel and was awarded IR¬£300,000.

Lock in 1989 and originally published by Signal Research in Greensboro, North Carolina. The original publication began as Game Players Strategy to Nintendo Games (the cover featured a disclaimer that claimed it had no affiliation with Nintendo, which already had its official publication in Nintendo Power). The magazine evolved over the years, spinning off a separate publication called Game Players Sega Genesis Guide when Sega entered the console market. These two magazines were later folded together into one magazine. In 1996, the magazine changed its name to Ultra Game Players and introduced a radically different format.

The magazine also featured mini- strategy guides, paper toys, trading cards and other branded items and extras, like posters for games, that were included when the issue was polybagged. During 1989 and 1990, the company also put out a total of 16 \\"GameTapes\\", which were VHS tapes that showed how to beat certain NES games. Humor is included in almost every videogame review and image caption. Readers' letters come at the beginning of the magazine and are often one of the highlights of the magazine. The magazine often includes a \\"newsletter\\" with irreverent jokes about magazine staffers, as well as cartoons. The introduction of Ultra Game Players was intended to coincide with the release of the Nintendo 64 and Super Mario 64, as originally, the Nintendo 64 went by the name Nintendo Ultra 64. Ultra Game Players features an updated design which places the readers' letters at the end of the magazine. One of the features of Ultra Game Players is a \\"prize store\\" in which readers answered trivia questions for chances to win prizes. However, many readers complained that the humor that had made Game Players such an enjoyable magazine was missing from the Ultra version, which prompted a return to form soon after the switch.

Regional tartans of Canada are represented by all Canada's provinces and territories, except for Nunavut, having a regional tartan, as do many other regional divisions in Canada. Tartans were first brought to Canada by Scottish settlers; the first province to adopt one officially was Nova Scotia in 1956 (when registered at the Court of the Lord Lyon; adopted by law in 1963), and the most recent province was Ontario, in 2000. Except for the tartan of Quebec, all of the provincial and territorial tartans are officially recognized and registered in the books of the Court of the Lord Lyon, King of Arms of Scotland. Maple leaf tartan The official tartan for Canada as a whole is known as the \\"Maple leaf tartan\\" and became an official national symbol in 2011. The maple leaf tartan was designed in 1964 by David Weiser to commemorate the new Canadian flag.Lewis 2004: 286 The four colours reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the seasons‚Äîgreen in the spring, gold in the early autumn, red at the first frost, and brown after falling. The Maple Leaf tartan is used by the Royal Canadian Regiment Pipes and Drums, and has been worn by the second, third and fourth Battalions. Its International Tartan Index number is 2034. Provincial and territorial tartans =Alberta= The idea for Alberta's official tartan began in 1961 at the Edmonton Rehabilitation Society, a charitable organization set up to teach useful skills to the disabled.Lewis 2004: 284 The tartan was designed by Alison Lamb, the Society's director, and Ellen Neilsen, the weaving instructor, and was officially adopted by the province in an Act of the Legislature on March 30, 1961. The green represents the province's forests, while the gold represents its grain fields. The shade of blue, as well as the gold, are also Alberta's provincial colours. Its International Tartan Index number is 2055. Alberta also has a dress tartan used for formal attire or special events.

Manitoba's official tartan was designed in 1962 by Hugh Kirkwood Rankine, and officially adopted by the province in \\"The Coat of Arms, Emblems and the Manitoba Tartan Act\\", which received Royal Assent on May 1 of that year. The red in the design originates from the Red River Colony, founded in 1812 by the Earl of Selkirk, Thomas Douglas, and crofters from the Scottish Highlands, and the blue was taken from the Clan Douglas tartan. In addition, the green lines represent the varying cultures and races that make up Manitoban society, and the gold represents Manitoba's agricultural history.Lewis 2004: 288 Its International Tartan Index number is 144. =New Brunswick= The official tartan of New Brunswick was commissioned by William Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook in 1959 and designed by the Loomcrofters in Gagetown, New Brunswick.Lewis 2004: 289 It was officially adopted as the provincial tartan by an Order in Council in the same year.

Its International Tartan Index number is 1880. =Newfoundland and Labrador= The tartan of Newfoundland and Labrador. The official tartan of Newfoundland and Labrador was designed in 1955 by Samuel B. Wilansky, a local store owner on Water Street in St. John's. It was registered in the Court of the Lord Lyon in 1973. The white, gold, and yellow come from the province's official anthem, \\"Ode to Newfoundland\\":Lewis 2004: 290 When sun rays crown thy pine clad hills And summer spreads her hand When silvern voices tune thy rills We love thee, smiling land ... When spreads thy cloak of shimmering white At winter's stern command Thro' shortened day, and starlit night We love thee, frozen land.

Its International Tartan Index number is 1543. Labrador The region of Labrador also has its own design of tartan and it was created by Michael S. Martin. The tartan of Labrador, which can be related to Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, was sent to the Scottish Register of Tartans, which assigned reference number 10004 to the tartan. =Northwest Territories= The idea of an official tartan for Northwest Territories was proposed by Janet Anderson-Thomson after she attended an RCMP ball in 1966 and noticed that the piper was, as she later described it, \\"terribly drab\\". She and her husband John, a land surveyor, both discussed the idea with Stuart Hodgson, then Commissioner of Northwest Territories, who supported it. The design was then created by Hugh MacPherson (Scotland) Limited of Edinburgh, a tartan designer and manufacturer, with Anderson-Thomson's colour suggestions: green for the forests, white for the Arctic Ocean, blue for the Northwest Passage, gold for the territories' mineral wealth, red-orange for autumn foliage, and a thin black line to represent the tree line.

History The restaurant was started in 1896 by Joshua Anthony Rao, who moved with his parents from Italy to the United States. He bought a small shop in Italian Harlem, once a very large Italian-American community, and ran the restaurant until his death in 1909. Louis Rao took over the business. He was seen by many as a very suave man. He had his hair cut at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and wore many fancy suits. Former co-owner Frank Pellegrino described those days as \\"the days of big Cadillacs and usually convertibles.\\" He was much more conservative in behavior and looks and refined the cuisine into a simpler Italian menu, with the help of \\"Aunt Jake.\\" After Vincent Rao's death in 1999, the restaurant was taken over by Frank Pellegrino, Anna Pellegrino Rao's nephew, and Ronald Straci, another close relative. Anna Pellegrino Rao refined the menu further with the help of Vincent and she is the source of much of the menu's identity today. On December 6, 2006, Rao's opened a second restaurant in Las Vegas, under executive chef Carla Pellegrino, with two ten- table rooms and additional seating available on an outdoor garden patio. In early 2009, Rao's in Las Vegas opened a bocce bar outside and began offering bocce lessons and cocktails there. On July 25, 2013, Frank Pellegrino Jr. announced on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon that Rao's will open in Hollywood soon. It has since been opened. Rao's now sells products in gourmet markets and supermarkets. Products include pasta, sauces, as well as olive oil. Though small, Italian Harlem culture is still kept alive by Rao's and the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Every year on the second weekend of August in honor of Back To School, the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \\"Dancing of the Giglio\\" is performed while thousands of visitors and onlookers celebrate the once largest Italian community in New York City. The New York Post describes the restaurant as \\"one of the hardest places to get into in the city\\". Notable patrons of the eatery have included John Gotti, Rudy Giuliani, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Matt Sullivan, Paul Vario, Anthony Salerno, Henry Hill, Steven Crea, Michael Rosenthal, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Anthony Scaramucci, Donald Trump, and many New York members of La Cosa Nostra. In media =Film= In the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, which premiered in December 2013, Leonardo DiCaprio is seen eating dinner in Rao's Restaurant. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow would regularly eat at Rao's in the 1980s. Mrs. Rao inspired the character Tina Vitale in his 1984 film Broadway Danny Rose. =Music= In 2009, Jay-Z shot the music video for \\"D.O.A.\\" (Death of Autotune) at Rao's. =Television= Rao's was the basis for \\"Raimondo's,\\" a fictional restaurant featured as the site of a murder in the Law & Order episode \\"Everybody Loves Raimondo's.\\" The owner of the fictional restaurant was played by actor Ray Abruzzo, who later co-starred with Pellegrino on The Sopranos. The episode was based on a shooting at the restaurant in 2003. On Top Chef: All Stars, season 8, episode 8, an elimination challenge required the chefs to cook a three- course family-style Italian meal at Rao's restaurant for the judges and Rao's owners and staff. On an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, Season 7, episode 2 \\"Pantaleone's\\", Gordon Ramsay talks about the history of Rao's restaurant to the family who owns the pizza shop \\"Pantalone's\\" in Denver, Colorado. He then takes the father and son to the Rao's restaurant at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. They then meet the owner and learn that he is the 4th generation of successors to operate the family-owned restaurant.

Ingram, Gaye G., Labensky, Sarah R., Labensky, Steven. Webster‚Äôs New World Dictionary of Culinary Arts 2nd Edition. The dish originated in the United States during the early 20th century. History Early and mid-20th century American cookbooks offer plenty of sloppy joe-type recipes, though they go by different names: Toasted Deviled Hamburgers,Good Housekeeping Cook Book, Katharine Fisher [1944] (p. 534), Chopped Meat Sandwiches,Young America's Cook Book, Home Institute of the New York Herald Tribune [1940] (p. 36) Spanish Hamburgers,Cook Book, McCordsville Methodist Church [1951] (p. 7) Hamburg a la Creole,Prudence Penny's Cookbook, [1939] (p.67) Beef Mironton,The New Butterick Cook Book, Flora Rose [1924] (p. 266) and Minced Beef Spanish Style.Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book, Sarah Tyson Rorer [1902] (p. 157) Sloppy joe meat being prepared with Manwich sauce Marilyn Brown, Director of the Consumer Test Kitchen at H.J. Heinz in Pittsburgh, says their research at the Carnegie Library suggests that the sloppy joe's origins lie with the \\"loose meat sandwiches\\" sold in Sioux City, Iowa, in the 1930s and were the creation of a cook named Joe.The American Century Cookbook: The Most Popular Recipes of the 20th Century, Jean Anderson. References to sloppy joes as sandwiches begin by the 1940s. One example from Ohio is a 1944 Coshocton Tribune ad under the heading \\"'Good Things to Eat' says 'Sloppy Joes' ‚Äì 10c ‚Äì Originated in Cuba ‚Äì You'll ask for more ‚Äì The Hamburg Shop\\" and elsewhere on the same page, \\"Hap is introducing that new sandwich at The Hamburg Shop ‚Äì Sloppy Joes ‚Äì 10c\\".Coshocton Tribune (Coshocton, Ohio), Oct. 29, 1944, p. 11 The term sloppy joe's had an earlier definition of any cheap restaurant or lunch counter serving cheap food quicklyDictionary of American Slang, Wentworth & Flexner, 2nd supp. edition, p. 488 or of a type of casual clothing.Advertisement, Pittsburgh Press. Oct. 8, 1940 Food companies began producing packaged sloppy joe, in cans with meat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgNB9EVisZ8, or just the sauce, such as Manwich, by the 1960s. Variations Several variations of the sloppy joe exist in North America. In Quebec, Canada, sandwiches of stewed ground beef such as pain √† la viande and pain fourr√© gumbo are usually served on hot dog buns. A similar sandwich, the \\"dynamite\\", exists in the area around Woonsocket, Rhode Island, and is distinguished by the use of onions, bell peppers, and sometimes celery. Stewed meat sandwiches are common in several other culinary traditions as well. The rou jia mo, from China's Shaanxi Province, consists of stewed pork, beef, or lamb on a steamed bun. Keema pav of Indian cuisine uses a pav bread roll filled with keema, a minced, stewed, curried meat. Ground turkey or textured vegetable protein may be used as a substitute for ground beef. A sloppy joe differs from a traditional loose meat or tavern sandwich due largely to its tomato-based sauce. In some stores in northern New Jersey, an unrelated sandwich made with a combination of deli meat, such as turkey, roast beef or especially ham, with coleslaw, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese on three slices of rye bread is also known as a sloppy joe.

Founded in 1969 by Dr. Susan Chilvers, The New School employs a \\"project approach\\" to curriculum. Rather than dividing subject matter into discrete timeslots, units and individual facts, instructors draw together academic subjects into large scale projects, incorporating the interests and ideas of the students along the way. Plans for projects may be generated by one child, a group, a teacher, or a parent, and may end up involving just one individual, the entire school, or any sized group in between. This approach ensures that students don't get bored or \\"burned out,\\" while simultaneously empowering them in many ways. It also makes their work and their time more meaningful to them, and results in a deeper understanding of concepts, as opposed to a mere retention of data. Our students learn to take ownership for planning and carrying through on their work, and they find satisfaction in their own processes, as opposed to finding it merely in the approval of others. Creative play and problem solving are an integral part of the learning process. New School High School of Monmouth County (NSHS) was a high school in the Monmouth County area of New Jersey that opened in 1998, notable for its style of alternative education until its closure in 2004. The New School of Monmouth County High School Founded by former public school teacher Dale Thompson and the daughter of one of the founders of the original New School elementary school, Rebekah Chilvers, the New School High School marked a radical departure from traditional educational philosophy. The New School tenets were drawn from a variety of British alternative teaching practice known as \\"open-classroom.\\" Rather than relying on tests and grades to measure student progress, the New School High School or NSHS abolished these practices and instead centered on individualized learning centered on all-encompassing yearly themes. Work completed during the course of the year was collected in a portfolio, which served as an alternative method of measuring student's achievements (rather than using grades). The NSHS also had rather lax policies, compared to traditional public schools, in such areas as scheduling, dress codes, etc. However, the NSHS never grew to a particularly large size. After a peak in enrollment in the 2001-2002 school year, the size of the student body began declining. The replacement of Dale's Thompson's co-teacher twice also caused some difficulty for the school. In 2003, the NSHS's name was changed to the Atlantic School. The Atlantic School was short lived. In June 2004, the last graduates were promoted and the school itself shut down.

More recently, a Portuguese occupation has left its own marks, while geographic neighbors like the United Arab Emirates, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also had a profound influence. In contrast to other Arab countries, Omani traditional music has a strong emphasis on rhythm. Traditional music marks all the stages in the life of an Omani, including birth, circumcision, marriage and death. In contrast to many Arab countries, all Omanis participate in music, men and women, young and old.

Through photography, Opie, documents the relationship between the individual and the space inhabited. She is known for her portraits exploring the Los Angeles leather- dyke community.  Life  Opie was born in Sandusky, Ohio. She spent her early childhood in Ohio,Liesl Bradner (August 21, 2010), Football and art collide at LACMA Los Angeles Times. and was influenced heavily by photographer Lewis Hine. At the age of nine she received a Kodak Instamatic camera, and immediately began taking photographs of her family and community. She evolved as an artist at age 14 when she created her own darkroom. She later received a Masters of Fine Arts degree from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 1988. Prior to arriving at CalArts, she was a strictly black-and- white photographer. Opie's thesis project entitled Master Plan (1988) examined a wide variety of topics. The project looked deeper into construction sites, advertisement schemes, homeowner regulations, and the interior layout of their homes within the community of Valencia, California. In 1988 Opie moved to Los Angeles, California and began working as an artist. She supported herself by accepting a job as a lab technician at the University of California, Irvine.Catherine Opie: American Photographer, September 26, 2008 ‚Äì January 7, 2009 Solomon R.

Sheets (January 27, 2013), Home Views, Bound by Ice or Leather The New York Times. In 2001, Opie gave birth to a boy named Oliver though intrauterine insemination. At the Hammer Museum, Opie was on the first Artist Council (a series of sessions with curators and museum administrators) and served on the board of overseers.Susan Emerling (April 19, 2009), The Hammer Museum gets together with artists, outside the box Los Angeles Times. Along with fellow artists John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger and Ed Ruscha, Opie served as member on the board for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. In 2012, she and the others resigned; however, they joined the museum's 14-member search committee for a new director after Jeffrey Deitch's resignation in 2013.Mike Boehm (September 24, 2013), MOCA adds artists who resigned from board to its director search team Los Angeles Times.

She was also on the board of the Andy Warhol Foundation. Along with Richard Hawkins, Opie curated a selection of work by the late artist, Tony Greene, at the 2014 Whitney Biennial, in New York.David Ng (November 15, 2013), \\"Whitney Biennial 2014 to include L.A. artists, David Foster Wallace\\".

She currently instructs numerous courses, and serves as a board member for Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, as well as the Andy Warhol Foundation. Work Dusty by Opie, 2007 Opie's work is characterized by a combination of formal concerns, a variety of printing technologies, references to art history, and social/political commentary. It demonstrates a mix between traditional photography and unconventional subjects. For example, she explores abstraction in the landscape vis-a-vis the placement of the horizon line in the Icehouses (2001) and Surfers (2003) series. She has printed photographs using chromochrome, iris prints, Polaroids, and silver photogravure. Examples of art history references include the use of bright color backgrounds in portraits which reference the work of Hans Holbein and the full body frontal portraits that reference August Sander. Opie's work from the 1990s could be related to the traditions of Renaissance and Baroque art: placing her subjects central to the composition, utilizing stark, dramatic light source, allowing her subjects to fall in front of rich backgrounds; Opie's images relay a more aggressive undertone. Certain art historical attributes throughout her images, themes and/or icons that have been referenced throughout art history. Opie first came to be known with Being and Having (1991) and Portraits (1993‚Äì1997), which portray queer communities in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Being and Having looks at the outward portrayal of masculinity and is a reference to 17th-century Old Master portraiture. It conveyed strong ideals and perceptions based among persons of the LGBT community, referencing gender, age, race and identity; all constructed surrounding identity. This body of work similarly plays with performative aspects and play. These works read as iconography, themselves. Use of certain symbols in her works have allowed these portraits to sit separately from any of her previous works. The portraits, for instance, from Opie's more recent work in 2012, the image David, uses blood. The symbolism used in this work is recognized as a reoccurring statement for Opie, personally and allegorically. These images convey symbolic references to the celebration, embracing and remembrance of the shift and personal relationship with one's body. Opie's use of blood is also seen in another work, entitled, Self-portrait/cutting (1993). This particular piece is a photograph of an etching carved into her back. The blood etching is an image of two stick figure women holding hands. Behind them is a house, with birds flying through a partially sunny sky. It is very clearly a child's drawing. Opie is positioned in front of a baroque type wallpaper. It is emerald green, and coated in many symbolistic items. The items with the most symbolic value are the fruits. Fruits are known to symbolize fertility and abundance. It is important in this piece to recognize the significance of the fruit. These two women are not biologically able to produce a child, yet they stand in front of a house representing family. The overall placement of this etching suggests that she is proud to be a part of the LGBT community, yet she still feels the need to cover up her identity in certain situations. She may feel as though she always has to look over her shoulder to feel safe. Unlike other artists, Opie grounds her work in personal relationships, meanings and histories; however, this unfortunately precedent's the ability for one to read these images outside of the intimate content. Most of Opie's work sits in this very personal community, allowing for selective perceptions. Where some viewers may not understand certain allegories and symbols within her work, individuals who know Opie's work well can very identify specific conceptual or metaphorical statements within the images themselves. Where these images demand to be read as allegories, the performative aspect of this work differs from previous work Opie has produced. Opie's earlier work relies more heavily on documentary photography as opposed to allegorical, yet still provides a stark relationship to her investigation and use of powerful iconography throughout the years. A common social/political theme in her work is the concept of community. Opie has investigated aspects of community, making portraits of many groups including LGBT community; surfers; and most recently high school football players. Opie is interested in how identities are shaped by our surrounding architecture. Her work is informed by her identity as an out lesbian. Her works balance personal and political. Her assertive portraits bring queers to a forefront that is normally silenced by societal norms. Her work also explores how the idea of family varies between straight and LGBTQ communities. Opie highlights that LGBTQ households often base their families in close friendships and community while straight families focus on their individual family.Heartney, Eleanor, Helaine Posner, Nancy Princenthal, and Sue Scott. The Reckoning: Women Artists of the New Millennium. Munich: Prestel, 2013. Opie has referenced problems of visibility; where the reference to Renaissance paintings in her images declare the individuals as saints or characters. Opie's portraits document, celebrate and protect the community and individuals in which she photographs. In Portraits (1993‚Äì1997) she presents a variety of identities among the queer community such as drag kings, cross dressers, and F-to-M transexuals. During her time in Los Angeles, Opie focused heavily on her surrounding environment for her works Houses, Freeways, and Mini-malls. Houses (1995‚Äì1996) shifted towards domestic architecture through portraits of Beverly Hills and Bel Air mansions. Freeways (1994‚Äì1995) depicts the Los Angeles highway system in black and white, which was unique to her usual style. Mini-malls (1997‚Äì1998) concluded her works on iconic images of Los Angeles culture by depicting billboards as well as identifying various ethnic groups in shopping centers. This Los Angeles-focused series sparked her ongoing project American Cities (1997‚Äìpresent) which is a collection of panoramic black-and-white photographs of quintessential American cities. This series is similar to an earlier work of hers, Domestic (1995‚Äì1998) which documented her 2-month RV road trip, portraying lesbian families engaging in everyday house-hold activities across the country. Drawing inspiration from transgressive photography of Robert Mapplethorpe, Nan Goldin, and sex radicals, who provided a space for liberals and feminists, Opie has also explored controversial topics and imagery in her work. In her O folio‚Äî6 photogravures from 1999‚ÄîOpie photographed S-M porn images she took earlier for On Our Backs, but as extreme close-ups. In 2011 Opie photographed the home of the actress Elizabeth Taylor in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Taylor died during the project, and never met Opie. Opie took 3,000 images for the project; 129 comprised the completed study. The resultant images were published as 700 Nimes Road. Collector Daily noted the \\"relentless femininity of Taylor's taste\\" in the images contrasted with Opie's self declared \\"identity as a butch woman\\" in Opie's forward to 700 Nimes Road and Opie's \\"status as an ordinary mortal\\" in comparison to Taylor's stardom. Opie's first film The Modernist (2017) is a tribute to French filmmaker Chris Marker's 1962 classic La Jet√©e. Composed of 800 still images, the film features Pig Pen (aka Stosh Fila)‚Äîa genderqueer performance artist‚Äîas the protagonist. The Modernist has been described as an ode to the city in which it takes place, Los Angeles, but it is also seen as questioning the legacy of modernism in America. The twenty- two-minute film, in summary, is about an aggravated artist who just wants his own homes as he has fallen in love with the architecture of Los Angeles. Being unable to purchase a place to live, the performance artist goes around burning down lovely architecture of LA. Publications *Freeways.

Biography Claude was born in Fontainebleau, but as she was believed to have been conceived at Chateau d'Anet, she was nicknamed as 'Mademoiselle d'Anet' at court, a nickname that displeased her mother. Claude was raised alongside her sister Elisabeth, and her future sister-in-law, Mary, Queen of Scots. The royal children were raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d'Humi√®res and his wife Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers. Claude was victim of the unhealthy traits that Catherine appeared to pass on to all her children with the exception of Marguerite, and suffered from a hunchback and a club foot, and during her childhood she was frequently vulnerable to various child diseases. On 19 January 1559, at the age of 11, she married Charles III, Duke of Lorraine in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. The marriage was arranged as a symbolic union of peace between France and Lorraine, after Charles III had spent his childhood as a hostage at the French royal court, and completed after the Treaty of Chateau-Cambresis. Claude departed to Lorraine with her spouse in late 1559, shortly before the departure of her sister Elisabeth to Spain and her aunt Marguerite to Savoy. =Duchess of Lorraine= The relationship between Claude and Charles III was described as a happy one. Claude was a favorite of her mother, who occasionally visited her in Lorraine, visits described as rare occasions of private family gatherings in the life of Catherine de' Medici, who enjoyed to see her grandchildren by Claude and also liked her son-in-law Charles very much. Catherine de' Medici was, for example, present in Bar-le-Duc for the baptism of Claude's firstborn son Henry. Claude attended the wedding between Henry of Navarre and her sister Margaret of Valois in Paris in August 1572. On her way there, she had been ill and cared for by her mother in Chalons, which was the reason why Catherine de' Medici had been absent from the royal court during the border attack of Jean de Genlis near the Spanish Netherlands in July, which was used by Admiral Coligny to attempt to convince Charles IX to declare war on Spain. On the evening of the Massacre, Claude was evidently informed that a massacre was to take place against the groom of her sister and his followers, and Margaret of Valois described how Claude had tears in her eyes and tried to stop her from leaving their mother's chamber, when Margaret was about to retire to the chamber of her spouse. Claude took Margaret's arm and begged her not to leave: she was contradicted by their mother, who warned Claude not to tell Margaret anything. Claude told their mother that it was not right to send Margaret to be \\"sacrificed\\", as she would risk becoming a target, but Catherine de' Medici replied to Claude that Margaret would be safe if God wished it, that it would arouse suspicion if she did not go, and then told Margaret to leave, upon which Claude cried. After the massacre started, one of the courtiers of Navarre, de Leran, broke into the bedchamber of Margaret and begged her to save him from the captain of the Guards, M. de Nancay, who gave her the man's life, and then escorted her to the chamber of Claude, where she was given refuge during the massacre. During the last of her frequent visits to the French court, her brother the king gave her the gift of \\"the ransoms of Guyenne, which came from the confiscations that took place there\\", and in turn gave one of the ransoms to Jeanne de Dampierre when asked. Brant√¥me gave the following description of her: :\\"In her beauty she resembled her mother, in her knowledge and kindness she resembled her aunt; and the people of Lorraine found her ever kind as long as she lived, as I myself have seen when I went to that country; and after her death they found much to say of her. In fact, by her death that land was filled with regrets, and M. de Lorraine mourned her so much that, though he was young when widowed of her, he would not marry again, saying he could never find her like, though could he do so he would remarry, not being disinclined. [...] In short, she was a true daughter of France, having good mind and ability, which she proved by seconding wisely and ably her husband, M. de Lorraine, in the government of his seigneuries and principalities.\\" Claude died in childbirth in 1575 at the age of 27. Brant√¥me wrote that she \\"died in child-bed, through the appetite of an old midwife of Paris, a drunkard, in whom she had more faith than in any other.\\" Children Charles&Claude; wedding portrait Claude and her husband had nine children: * Henry II, Duke of Lorraine (1563‚Äì1624) * Christina of Lorraine (16 August 1565 ‚Äì 19 December 1637); married Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. * Charles of Lorraine (1567‚Äì1607), Cardinal of Lorraine and Bishop of Metz (1578‚Äì1607), Bishop of Strasbourg (1604‚Äì1607). * Antonia of Lorraine (1568‚Äì1610); married Jean-Guillaume, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg. * Anne of Lorraine (1569‚Äì1576) * Francis II, Duke of Lorraine (1572‚Äì1632) * Catherine of Lorraine (1573‚Äì1648), Abesse de Remiremont. * Elisabeth of Lorraine (1574‚Äì1635); married Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. * Claude of Lorraine (1575‚Äì1576) Ancestors  References  Sources    External links *Medici Archive Project 1547 births 1575 deaths French princesses House of Valois-Angoul√™me House of Lorraine Duchesses of Lorraine Deaths in childbirth People from Fontainebleau Princesses of Lorraine French people of Breton descent French people of Italian descent 16th-century French women 16th-century French people ","title":"Claude of France (1547‚Äì1575)"},{"id":"989733","title":"Palaiologos"},{"id":"989740","text":"Gardner's syndrome (also known as Gardner syndrome, familial polyposis of the colon, or familial colorectal polyposis) is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the colon together with tumors outside the colon. The extracolonic tumors may include osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas, as well as the occurrence of desmoid tumors in approximately 15% of affected individuals. Desmoid tumors are fibrous tumors that usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. The countless polyps in the colon predispose to the development of colon cancer; if the colon is not removed, the chance of colon cancer is considered to be very significant. Polyps may also grow in the stomach, duodenum, spleen, kidneys, liver, mesentery and small bowel. In a small number of cases, polyps have also appeared in the cerebellum. Cancers related to Gardner syndrome commonly appear in the thyroid, liver and kidneys. The number of polyps increases with age, and hundreds to thousands of polyps can develop in the colon. The syndrome was first described in 1951. There is no cure at this time, and in its more advanced forms, it is considered a terminal diagnosis with a life expectancy of 35‚Äì45 years; treatments are surgery and palliative care, although some chemotherapy has been tried with limited success. Cause Gardner syndrome is caused by mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC gene), located in chromosome 5q21 (band q21 on chromosome 5). This gene is also mutant in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a more common disease that also predisposes to colon cancer. Nuances in the understanding of genetics have caused some disorders to be split into multiple entities, while others merged into one genetic condition. After most of the second half of the 20th century, Gardner syndrome has been merged into FAP and is now considered simply a phenotypic subtype of FAP. FAP defined by the development of hundreds or thousands of polyps in the colon. Gardner syndrome is set apart as a subtype because, in addition to colonic polyps, there are also extra-colonic growths (both malignant and benign). There are many terms used to describe \\"APC-associated polyposis condition\\" including FAP, attenuated FAP, Gardner syndrome, Turcot syndrome, and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). There is a movement toward no longer using the terms Gardner Syndrome or Turcot Syndrome since both are part of the FAP spectrum. Gardner syndrome and Turcot syndrome are regarded primarily for historical interest. Genetics Gardner syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Gardner syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Typically, one parent has Gardner syndrome. Each of their children, male and female alike, are at 50% risk of inheriting the gene for Gardner syndrome. Diagnosis Gardner syndrome consists of adenomatous polyps of the gastrointestinal tract, desmoid tumours, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, lipomas, dental abnormalities and periampullary carcinomas. The incidence of the syndrome is 1:14,025 with an equal sex distribution. It is determined by the autosomal dominant familial polyposis coli gene (APC) on chromosome 5. Gardner syndrome can be identified based on oral findings, including multiple impacted and supernumerary teeth, multiple jaw osteomas that give a \\"cotton-wool\\" appearance to the jaws, as well as multiple odontomas, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), in addition to multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon. Gardner syndrome is also associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and may manifest as aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) of the retroperitoneum.DeVita. Cancer, Principles and Practice of Oncology, 8th Ed. p. 1742. Desmoid tumors arise most frequently from the aponeurosis of the rectus abdominal muscle of multiparous women. The extra- abdominal form is rare and desmoids of the breast may arise in the mammary gland or may occur as an extension of a lesion arising from the muscles of the chest wall. The incidence of mammary desmoid tumours is less than 0.2% of primary breast neoplasms. In Gardner‚Äôs syndrome the incidence ranges from 4% to 17%. Desmoid tumours associated with Gardner‚Äôs syndrome have been shown to have an alteration of the Œ≤-catenin pathway and over express Œ≤-catenin. Treatment There is no cure for Gardner Syndrome. Treatments focus on alleviating symptoms and reducing risk of cancer. Treatments for desmoid tumors may include surgery, NSAIDS, anti-estrogen medications, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Eponym The syndrome is named for Eldon J. Gardner (1909‚Äì1989), a geneticist who first described it in 1951.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York City. A prolific writer, he was highly influential in the development of cultural materialism. In his work, he combined Karl Marx's emphasis on the forces of production with Thomas Malthus's insights on the impact of demographic factors on other parts of the sociocultural system. Labeling demographic and production factors as infrastructure, Harris posited these factors as key in determining a society's social structure and culture. After the publication of The Rise of Anthropological Theory in 1968, Harris helped focus the interest of anthropologists in cultural-ecological relationships for the rest of his career. Many of his publications gained wide circulation among lay readers. Over the course of his professional life, Harris drew both a loyal following and a considerable amount of criticism. He became a regular fixture at the annual meetings of the American Anthropological Association, where he would subject scholars to intense questioning from the floor, podium, or bar. He is considered a generalist, who had an interest in the global processes that account for human origins and the evolution of human cultures. In his final book, Theories of Culture in Postmodern Times, Harris argued that the political consequences of postmodern theory were harmful, a critique similar to those later developed by philosopher Richard Wolin and others. Early career Being born just before the Great Depression, Harris was poor during his childhood in Brooklyn. He entered the U.S. Army toward the end of the Second World War and used funding from the G.I. Bill to enter Columbia University along with a new generation of post-war American anthropologists. Harris was an avid reader who loved to spend hours at the race track and he eventually developed a complex mathematical betting system that was successful enough to provide support for his wife, Madelyn, and him during his years of graduate school. Harris' early work was with his mentor, Charles Wagley, and his dissertation research in Brazil produced an unremarkable village study that carried on the Boasian descriptive tradition in anthropology‚Äîa tradition he would later denounce. After graduation, Harris was given an assistant professorship at Columbia and, while undertaking fieldwork in Mozambique in 1957, Harris underwent a series of profound transformations that altered his theoretical and political orientations. Theoretical contributions Harris' earliest work began in the Boasian tradition of descriptive anthropological fieldwork, but his fieldwork experiences in Mozambique in the late 1950s caused him to shift his focus from ideological features of culture toward behavioral aspects. His 1969 history of anthropological thought, The Rise of Anthropological Theory critically examined hundreds of years of social thought with the intent of constructing a viable understanding of human culture that Harris came to call Cultural Materialism. The book, affectionately known as \\"The RAT\\" among graduate students, is a synthesis of classical and contemporary macrosocial theory. Cultural materialism incorporated and refined Marx's categories of superstructure and base. Harris modified and amplified such core Marxist concepts as means of production and exploitation, but Harris rejected two key aspects of Marxist thought: the dialectic, which Harris attributed to an intellectual vogue of Marx's time; and unity of theory and practice, which Harris regarded as an inappropriate and damaging stance for social scientists. Harris also integrated Malthus' population theory into his research strategy as a major determinant factor in sociocultural evolution, which also contrasted with Marx's rejection of population as a causal element. According to Harris, the principal mechanisms by which a society exploits its environment are contained in a society's infrastructure‚Äîthe mode of production (technology and work patterns) and population (such as population characteristics, fertility and mortality rates). Since such practices are essential for the continuation of life itself, widespread social structures and cultural values and beliefs must be consistent with these practices. Since the aim of science, Harris writes: > is the discovery of the maximum amount of order in its field of inquiry, > priority for theory building logically settles upon those sectors under the > greatest direct restraints from the givens of nature. To endow the mental > superstructure [ideas and ideologies] with strategic priority, as the > cultural idealists advocate, is a bad bet. Nature is indifferent to whether > God is a loving father or a bloodthirsty cannibal. But nature is not > indifferent to whether the fallow period in a swidden [slash and burn] field > is one year or ten. We know that powerful restraints exist on the > infrastructural level; hence it is a good bet that these restraints are > passed on to the structural and superstructural components. (Harris 1979, > 57) Harris made a critical distinction between emic and etic, which he refined considerably since its exposition in The Rise of Anthropological Theory. The terms \\"emic\\" and \\"etic\\" originated in the work of missionary-linguist Kenneth Pike, despite the latter's conceptual differences with Harris' constructs. As used by Harris, emic meant those descriptions and explanations that are right and meaningful to an informant or subject, whereas etic descriptions and explanations are those used by the scientific community to germinate and force theories of sociocultural life. That is, emic is the participant's perspective, whereas etic is the observer's. Harris had asserted that both are in fact necessary for an explanation of human thought and behavior. Harris' early contributions to major theoretical issues include his revision of biological surplus theory in obesity formation. He also became well known for formulating a materialist explanation for the treatment of cattle in religion in Indian culture. Along with Michael Harner, Harris is one of the scholars most associated with the suggestion that Aztec cannibalism occurred, and was the result of protein deficiency in the Aztec diet.Harris, M. (1988). pp.468-469 An explanation appears in Harris' book Cannibals and Kings. Harris also invoked the human quest for animal protein to explain Yanomamo warfare, contradicting ethnographer Napoleon Chagnon‚Äôs sociobiological explanation involving innate male human aggressiveness. Several other publications by Harris examine the cultural and material roots of dietary traditions in many cultures, including Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture (1975); Good to Eat: Riddles of Food and Culture (1998; originally titled The Sacred Crow and the Abominable Pigs) and his co-edited volume, Food and Evolution: Toward a Theory of Human Food Habits (1987). Harris' Why Nothing Works: The Anthropology of Daily Life (1981; originally titled America Now: the Anthropology of a Changing Culture) applies concepts from cultural materialism to the explanation of such social developments in late twentieth century United States as inflation, the entry of large numbers of women into the paid labor force, marital stability, and shoddy products. His Our Kind: Who We Are, Where We're From, Where We Are (1990) surveys the broad sweep of human physical and cultural evolution, offering provocative explanations of such subjects as human transsexualism and nontranssexualism and the origins of inequality. Finally, Harris' 1979 work, Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture, updated and re-released in 2001, offers perhaps the most comprehensive statement of cultural materialism. A separate article lists the many and diverse publications of Marvin Harris. =Criticisms and controversies= While Harris' contributions to anthropology are wide,Giulio Angioni, Fare, dire, sentire (Nuoro, Il Maestrale, 2011) it has been said that \\"Other anthropologists and observers had almost as many opinions about Dr. Harris as he had about why people behave as they do.\\" The Smithsonian magazine allegedly called him \\"one of the most controversial anthropologists alive.\\" The Washington Post described him as \\"a storm center in his field\\", and the Los Angeles Times accused him of \\"overgeneralized assumptions\\". Harris could be an acerbic critic of other theories and frequently received return fire. In the last decade of his life, he engaged in a running battle with the postmodernists who he thought had inordinate influence in anthropology in the last part of the 20th century. Academic career Harris received both his MA and PhD degrees from Columbia University, the former in 1949 and the latter in 1953. He performed fieldwork in Brazil and Portuguese-speaking Africa before joining the faculty at Columbia. He eventually became chairman of the anthropology department at Columbia. During the Columbia student campus occupation of 1968, Harris was among the few faculty leaders who sided with the students when they were threatened and beaten by the police. During the 1960s and 1970s, he was a resident of Leonia in New Jersey.Marvin Harris , Cultural-Materialism.org. Accessed May 27, 2008. \\"Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Harris and his family lived in Leonia, New Jersey, which borders Fort Lee, right across the Hudson River from upper Manhattan.\\" Harris next joined the University of Florida anthropology department in 1981 and retired in 2000, becoming the Anthropology Graduate Research Professor Emeritus. Harris also served as the Chair of the General Anthropology Division of the American Anthropological Association. Harris was the author of seventeen books. Two of his college textbooks, Culture, People, Nature: An Introduction to General Anthropology and Cultural Anthropology, were published in seven editions. His research spanned the topics of race, evolution, and culture. He often focused on Latin America and Brazil, at University of Florida; accessed 2006. but also focused on the Islas de la Bahia, Ecuador, Mozambique, and India.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 2007, and served as speaker of the assembly from 1988 to 1995. Rocan was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, but became an independent in 2007. Rocan was born to a French Canadian family in Somerset, Manitoba and was raised in north-end Winnipeg. He is also m√©tis by background and a direct descendant of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodi√®re and Marie-Anne Gaboury. He was educated at Sacr√©- Coeur in Winnipeg, Somerset Collegiate and Otterburne College. He is fluently bilingual in English and French. Rocan worked as a farmer before entering political life, and also operated a building and moving company and a grain business. He is a Shriner and a freemason, as well as a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, winning the rural, southern constituency of Turtle Mountain. Rural seats in southern Manitoba are generally considered safe for the Progressive Conservative party, and Rocan was elected by more than 2,000 votes over his nearest opponent. The New Democratic Party won the election, and Rocan served as a member of the opposition. Rocan was re-elected over Liberal candidate Ross McMillan in the 1988 election, though his majority was cut to about 600 votes. The Progressive Conservatives emerged from this election with a minority government, and Rocan was appointed as speaker of the assembly by premier Gary Filmon on July 21, 1988. He was the first Franco- Manitoban to serve as speaker for the provincial assembly. Support for the Liberal Party declined in the 1990 provincial election, and Rocan was easily re-elected in the redistributed constituency of Gladstone. He won the constituency a second time in the 1995 election, but was not re-appointed as speaker and served for the next four years as a backbench supporter of Filmon's government. Rocan was respected by all parties in the legislature, and his tenure as speaker was free of the controversies over partisanship which plagued his successor, Louise Dacquay. Further redistribution brought Rocan into the riding of Carman for the 1999 provincial election. He was easily returned, and was re-elected again in the 2003 election. The Progressive Conservatives lost both elections to the New Democratic Party, and Rocan served as a member of the opposition. A former smoker, he supported premier Gary Doer's efforts to ban public smoking in 2003. Rocan supported his friend Reg Alcock in the federal elections of 2000 and 2004, despite the fact that Alcock is a Liberal. On November 16, 2006, Rocan lost the Carman Conservative nomination to Blaine Pedersen. On April 18, 2007, Rocan was removed from the Conservative caucus for supporting the NDP budget, which his party opposed. He considered running as an independent candidate in the 2007 election, but declined. Rocan later bought a small house in Arizona for the winter, becoming a long-haul trucker.

She was first elected to the Richmond City Council in 2004 when she was a member of the Green Party of California. She won two consecutive four-year terms as the city's mayor in 2006 and 2010. After reaching the mayoral term limit, she was reelected to the City Council in 2014. In June 2017, she announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor of California in the 2018 election. McLaughlin's election in 2006 made Richmond the largest U.S. city led by a Green Party member. She has espoused a minimum wage increase and a plan to forcibly appropriate foreclosed home mortgages from banks. She has led an ongoing effort to restrict the municipal influence of Richmond's largest employer, the Chevron Corporation, and to refashion its environmental obligations. Early life and education McLaughlin was born into a working class family in Chicago. The middle child of five daughters, her father was a union carpenter and her mother was a factory worker and housewife. During the 1980s, McLaughlin was an activist with the Central American solidarity movement and a steering committee member of CISPES (Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador). She also played an active role in the North Star Network, a national networking effort to unite progressives, and in coalition-building efforts with Rainbow/PUSH. She continues to work as a social activist in the peace, social justice, civil rights, and environmental movements. McLaughlin holds a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology, with graduate study in psychology and education.  Career  She has worked as a postal clerk, teacher, caregiver for the elderly, and tutor/clinician for children with learning disabilities. She has also worked in the capacity of support staff for various not-for-profit health and educational organizations.Mayor Gayle McLaughlin website , Gayle McLaughlin's official site, retrieved October 9, 2012 She has lived in Richmond since 2001. =Richmond Progressive Alliance= McLaughlin is a founder of the Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA), a non-partisan progressive group in western Contra Costa County, composed of members of the Green Party, Democratic Party, and the Peace and Freedom Party, as well as independent voters. In 2004, the RPA ran a slate of candidates to replace a municipal government that was widely seen as dysfunctional: \\"There are vacancies in virtually every major administrative department,\\" wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"and the city is operating with an interim city manager, city attorney, police chief and fire chief. The city has no library director and no parks and recreation director, and no one running its housing authority.\\" Together with RPA colleagues, McLaughlin won her first election to the Richmond City Council in November 2004. In Richmond, McLaughlin's activism has found her involved in many local struggles in support of both social and environmental justice. She opposed the Patriot Act, the criminalization of the homeless, and Chevron's Richmond Refinery tax perks. She has also been involved in an ongoing effort to stop development on the North Richmond shoreline and supports the Service Employees International Union. =Mayor of Richmond= Campaign sign, 2006 In 2006, McLaughlin decided to challenge Richmond's incumbent mayor Irma Anderson. She was elected on November 7, 2006 by a 242-vote margin over Anderson. At the time, her victory made Richmond the largest city in the country with a Green Party mayor. McLaughlin won a second term in office in the 2010 municipal election. She overcame a well-funded offensive to unseat her during the re-election campaign. Under McLaughlin's mayoralty, the \\"small, blue-collar city best known for its Chevron refinery has become the unlikely vanguard for anticorporate, left-wing activism\\". From early in her career, McLaughlin gave tangible governmental support to workers' cooperatives as a means of fighting unemployment. She was a strong proponent of Measure N, a proposed municipal soda tax that was met by determined, well-funded resistance from the American Beverage Association and other business interests. She also spearheaded a 2014 effort to raise Richmond's local minimum wage to US$12.30 per hour. The raise provided impetus to the broader statewide minimum wage movement. McLaughlin was a member of the nationwide advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition. McLaughlin was criticized for attending an Occupy rally on Veterans Day of 2011 instead of a symbolic ship-launching portrayal at the former Richmond Shipyards. McLaughlin stated she was a supporter of Veterans for Peace and Iraq Veterans Against the War. Eminent domain against banks The U.S. mortgage crisis of the late 2000s had a powerful impact on Richmond. Even by 2013, nearly half of all home mortgages in the city were \\"underwater\\", with owners owing more than their houses were worth. On average, homeowners with mortgages were indebted for about 45% more than the original value of their homes. McLaughlin mounted a unique and highly controversial effort to gain control of the mortgages. The city, in partnership with a private financing company, would seek to purchase mortgages from banks at fair market value and then allow the homeowners to refinance for a minimal fee. If the banks refused, the city would seize the mortgages using the legal power of eminent domain. Defending the plan, McLaughlin said mortgage seizures were necessary to alleviate \\"an unjust set of circumstances\\" facing homeowners after the Great Recession, and the use of eminent domain would be justified for the common good by preventing urban blight caused by abandoned foreclosed homes. The city thus has a right and duty to prevent foreclosures, as well as a legal necessity to protect its citizens: \\"People were tricked. They were sold these bad loans\\" which were far in excess of their value, and made Richmond \\"a community being victimized\\". In March 2013, the City Council voted 6‚Äì1 in favor of partnering with a San Francisco firm, Mortgage Resolution Partners (MRP), to begin enactment of the plan. Opponents in Richmond countered that the plan would help only a small subsection of mortgage-holders, while two banks, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, immediately filed lawsuits against the city. Arguing that it was an illegal use of eminent domain, the banks also warned that it would severely damage the U.S. mortgage industry by encouraging other municipalities to do the same. Other cities, including Newark, North Las Vegas, and Seattle were all said to be considering mortgage seizure, although only Richmond publicly pursued the plan. Undaunted, McLaughlin told the press in August 2013 that her administration was confident that it would prevail in court against the banks. The following month, after heated public debate, the City Council again voted to back McLaughlin and proceed with the plan. Chevron More than anything else, it is McLaughlin's contentious relationship with the Chevron Corporation that has defined her political history. The multinational energy corporation maintains a massive, century-old oil refinery in Richmond, and it has long dominated the city's economy and politics. After the RPA took root, however, the shift in government caused friction with Chevron, particularly after the McLaughlin administration fought it in court over the payment of various taxes. A major fire at the refinery in August 2012 led to another hotly contested lawsuit, this time for \\"willful and conscious disregard of public safety\\". Chevron spent $1.2 million in 2012 to oppose two Richmond Progressive Alliance (RPA) City Council candidates who were critical of the company and to support three that the oil company considered supportive. That was the one year that the RPA candidates lost. McLaughlin herself was not up for reelection that year, but strongly supported the two RPA candidates with whom she shared progressive values. =Return to City Council= Even after her mayoralty ended, Chevron continued to oppose her vigorously, \\"spending some $3 million ‚Äì an unheard of amount for a small, local election ‚Äì to campaign against McLaughlin and her slate\\" in the 2014 city council elections. She was nonetheless elected to the City Council in 2014 and served in this role until July 18, 2017, when she resigned to seek a higher political office. McLaughlin is not without critics such as the East Bay Times, which referred to her and the RPA in a 2016 editorial as \\"the biggest deniers of the city's fiscal crisis.\\" She and her fellow RPA candidates Eduardo Martinez and Jovanka Beckles all won by wide margins in 2014 despite having been heavily outspent by their opposition. The 2016 City Council elections were noticeably quieter in tone, with no financial input from Chevron, according to campaign finance reports. Two other RPA candidates, Melvin Willis and Ben Choi, won open seats creating a RPA majority in the City Council. In 2016, McLaughlin changed her political party registration from Green Party to NPP (\\"No Party Preference\\") so she could vote for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders in the California presidential primary. = Campaign for lieutenant governor = In June 2017, McLaughlin declared her candidacy for lieutenant governor in the California lieutenant gubernatorial election of 2018. Her independent campaign refused to accept any corporate contributions. Although she ran with no party affiliation, her endorsements include California's Green Party, Our Revolution, and the Peace and Freedom Party. The hotly contested primary race saw over $10 million raised by campaigns ‚Äì \\"far more than the $7.6 million that candidates raised for the entire election cycle the last time the seat was open in 2010\\". In a crowded field of eight, McLaughlin took 3.6% of the vote. = Books = A chronicle of the McLaughlin administration's rise and legacy, Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Remaking of an American City, was published in 2017 with a foreword written by Bernie Sanders. This was followed in early 2018 by McLaughlin's own memoir, Winning Richmond: How a Progressive Alliance Won City Hall.

History The area of North Richmond was populated by Ohlone tribes which settled the area in the 6th century. However, Hokan speaking people may have inhabited the area even earlier, and archaeological evidence shows human settlement to have begun at least by 4000 BC. The Ohlone tribesmen subsisted from hunter-gatherering the bountiful amount of land and sea life of the area. Especially the great amounts of seafood made available along the coastline of Castro Cove and the surrounding marshlands and delta of Wildcat and San Pablo creeks. The majority of present- day North Richmond was territory of the Karkin tribe (or Carquinez) however the land lies on what was a border area with the Choche√±o tribe and likely had influences of both groups. The tribes made great use of the salmon and trout runs on the rivers. However, today, culverting and damming has decimated the habitat for these species and they are rarely present ever at the opening of the watercourse. In the early part of the 20th century, North Richmond was populated by Italian-Americans.Images of America: Richmond, by Donald Bastin, Arcadia Publishing (SC), November 2003 During World War II, many African- Americans moved from the South and Midwest and came to the Western United States in order to find jobs helping the war effort. Many came to work in Richmond's shipyards and consequently, moved into North Richmond. Subsequently many of the residents were employed in the petroleum, railway, and shipping industries. Currently the population is estimated to be about 2,300 by the county of Contra Costa and 2,500 by the Richmond Confidential. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that North Richmond had a population of 3,717. The population density was 2,399.6 people per square mile (926.5/km).

Government The West Contra Costa Housing Authority of Contra Costa County is located in North Richmond. The area is policed by the Contra Costa County Sheriff's department. The community is governed by the county of Contra Costa and the current representative is supervisor John Gioia. At a community level the town does not have a city council or its own neighborhood councils.North Richmond Municipal Advisory Council . Calendar. contra-costa.ca.us Contra Costa County website. 2011. 08-02-2011. North Richmond does, though, have a community council that represents the resident's voices at the county level, known as the North Richmond Municipal Advisory Council. Richmond has considered annexing North Richmond several times since the 1960s. In fall 2011, the neighboring city of San Pablo conducted a telephone opinion poll of San Pablo residents. Among other items, the poll sought to assess San Pablo citizens' opinions on the possibility of the City of San Pablo annexing unincorporated North Richmond. Reasons cited included the opportunity for North Richmond residents to have direct representation and also give San Pablo waterfront access to San Pablo Bay.  Recreation  Sports such as baseball and basketball are important activities in the neighborhood, especially for young men. Baseball is played at the North Richmond Ballfield Complex and at Shields-Reid Park. Baseball has been a long tradition here and has been played by residents for decades. The Bay Area's Hyphy scene also resonates in this community, especially among many young people who aspire to be rappers and singers. Hip hop, Rap, and R&B; music, as with many areas densely populated by African Americans, is prominent among the area's youth.  Transportation  This area is served by AC Transit bus lines 76, 71, and 376, that connect the community with Richmond BART & Amtrak station, Contra Costa College in San Pablo, and Hilltop Mall in addition to other areas of west county.AC Transit System Map, AC Transit website, access date October 12, 2008 The line 376 is an owl service, and due to several assaults and other crimes committed on board during 2010 the bus is now escorted by a county sheriff's vehicle while inside town limits.North Richmond bus line gets police escort. Ted Trautman. Richmond Confidential. 24-02-2011. Retrieved 06-03-2011. In fact, many bus drivers refuse to work this line because of how dangerous it can be. Richmond Parkway, a connector between I-580 at Point Richmond and I-80 at the Hilltop area, runs through the west of North Richmond. Crime The area is notable for having one of the highest per-capita homicide rates in the nation. Coupled with the highest homicide rate, citizens have complained that law enforcement is ineffective in dealing with shootings in their community and that killers are almost never brought to justice.  Environment  North Richmond is next to Chevron Richmond Refinery in Richmond's Point Richmond District. The public health risks associated with emissions and chemical spills, especially of sulfur trioxide, are major concerns for the entire area. A community warning system of loud sirens is in place to warn residents of chemical spills. This warning is tested on the first Wednesday of every month, and can be heard from miles away. The Richmond dump is also in a tiny strip of Richmond that runs through North Richmond. The landfill pays into a mitigation fund used for community projects to offset how blight and pollution impact the town. In 2011 $56,000 were granted out of a $100,000 budget to building community gardens on vacant lots leased to the volunteer effort. The project aims to provide education and training for the cultivation and eating of healthful vegetables. Although the gardens will provide otherwise unavailable produce, North Richmonders still have to go to San Pablo or Richmond areas for groceries.

Most operational Lancasters were shot down before they had reached 20 sorties: of the 107,085 sorties by Lancasters despatched in bombing raids on Germany 2687 aircraft went missingMoyes 1976, p. 328. G-George has the added distinction of bringing home, alive, every crewman who flew aboard it. Upon retirement from combat duty in 1944, G-George was flown to Australia by an all-RAAF crew of Bomber Command veterans, and played a major part in raising war bonds during a round-Australia publicity trip. Post war, it was left to decay in the open air at RAAF Base Fairbairn, before being moved to the AWM in the early 1950s. In 2003, G-George returned to display at the AWM in the new ANZAC Hall after a five-year restoration program at the Treloar Technology Centre, which restored the aircraft as faithfully as possible to its wartime configuration. It is displayed in conjunction with a sound and light show that attempts to convey something of the atmosphere of a World War II Bomber Command raid, and incorporates a German '88' flak gun and a Bf 109 fighter. The display is based on a sortie captained by Flying Officer \\"Cherry\\" Carter to Berlin on \\"Black Thursday\\" December 1943, so called because Bomber Command lost 50 of the 500 bombers detailed for the raid - more than half were lost in landing accidents due to bad weather. G-George serves as a memorial to all Australians who flew with Bomber Command, and to the 1,018 dead of 460 Squadron. The designation 'G-George' comes from the RAF phonetic alphabet in use at the time. Individual aircraft on a squadron were allocated a letter and would be referred to using the corresponding word from the phonetic alphabet. Many other RAF squadrons would also have had a G-George but with different aircraft bearing that designation as they were lost in action or otherwise.

The group has produced five acclaimed studio albums and six mixtapes. Little Brother is highly regarded among hip hop fans and critics. History =Early career and The Listening album= The individual members of the group, rappers Phonte (Phonte Coleman), and Rapper Big Pooh (Thomas Jones), and DJ/producer 9th Wonder (Pat Douthit), met in 1998 while enrolled as college students at North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina. The group began as a trio. Little Brother were members of the North Carolina-based alternative hip hop collective, Justus League. In a February 2003 interview with MVRemix.com, Phonte explained the origins of the group's name: The official debut for Little Brother came in August 2001 with their first recording, \\"Speed\\". According to 9th Wonder in an interview with Complex, another rapper Median was actually supposed to be on the track before they got a hold of Big Pooh: They continued to work the local, Raleigh-Durham-area scene and were eventually signed by independent record label ABB Records. In 2002, they released the cult hit 7\\" single \\"Atari 2600\\", with lyrics centering on video games. In 2003, the group released their first full-length studio album, The Listening to critical acclaim. National recognition for the group, and particularly 9th Wonder, came when Jay-Z tapped 9th Wonder for the song \\"Threat\\", from his eighth studio album The Black Album. Following the release of The Listening, Little Brother opened for Oakland-based alternative hip hop collective Hieroglyphics on the latter's Full Circle national tour. =The Chittlin' Circuit 1.5 mixtape= Little Brother's first commercially distributed \\"mixtape\\". Released on June 21, 2005 ahead of their sophomore album The Minstrel Show. =The Minstrel Show album= Little Brother's second album, The Minstrel Show, released in September 2005, saw increased success for the group due to their raised popularity and praise for the album from critics. The album's theme compared present day rap music and the music industry to the minstrel shows of the late 19th century. A music video for the single, \\"Lovin' It\\", was directed by Joey Boukadakis. In 2005, Little Brother became embroiled in a short-lived feud, when Young Jeezy's prot√©g√© Slick Pulla challenged the group to a battle after hearing an interview in which Phonte voiced some disapproval concerning \\"drug rap\\" and Young Jeezy's \\"snowman mascot\\". Little Brother did not respond, and instead, Phonte called Slick Pulla and the pair resolved the misunderstanding. =Getback album and 9th Wonder's departure= In late 2006, Little Brother began recording their third album, and second for Atlantic Records, Getback. However, in January 2007, the group announced both their departure from Atlantic and that producer 9th Wonder had left the group. The move from Atlantic was due to the commercial failure of The Minstrel Show, and creative differences over the group's future material. Rapper Big Pooh said: The group's manager Big Dho added that there were no \\"ill feelings towards their (Atlantic) company.\\" The group's reason for the break from Atlantic and for 9th Wonder's departure was ultimately due to creative differences, but in both cases, the break and departure were described as amicable. As to 9th Wonder's departure from the group, Rapper Big Pooh was quoted as saying: On October 23, 2007 Little Brother released Getback, the long-awaited follow-up to The Minstrel Show. With no major video or radio airplay, Getback sold approximately 9,600 copies during its first week in stores and landed at No. 89 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album consisted of 11 songs, and featured several guests, most notably New Orleans- based rapper Lil Wayne. Lil Wayne had been a longtime fan of the group's work and was invited to rap on the third verse for \\"Breakin My Heart\\". Following the release of Getback in late 2007, Little Brother toured with Los Angeles- based alternative hip hop artist Evidence of Dilated Peoples. The remainder of 2007 found Little Brother working on becoming completely independent artists and putting out records on their own. Big Pooh told L.A. Record in an April 2008 interview that \\"For the next record, we definitely want ownership‚Äîthe first record we'll have 100% ownership of.\\" =...And Justus For All mixtape= Following the release of Getback, in mid-2008, Little Brother officially released their 2007 mixtape ...And Justus For All with DJ Mick Boogie taking over production duties for the departed 9th Wonder. The mixtape was released through the Hall of Justus collective with Little Brother controlling the project. In a June 2008 interview with HipHopDX.com, Rapper Big Pooh said: ...And Justus For All featured 5 new songs as well as enhanced mastered versions of songs on their 2007 mixtape with DJ Mick Boogie. The CD version contained 5 new songs for the album and the iTunes version had 7 new songs. The iTunes version linked former groupmate 9th Wonder to the group with the single, \\"Black Light Special\\". =Individual member side-projects= Outside of Little Brother, Phonte began a collaboration with Netherlands-based producer Nicolay as the group The Foreign Exchange, that ultimately resulted in the release of their debut album, Connected, in 2004. The Foreign Exchange released their follow-up album entitled Leave It All Behind, in October 2008. Rapper Big Pooh released a solo album entitled Sleepers in 2005. In 2009, he released two albums, The Delightful Bars, and Rapper's Delight. In early 2010, Rapper Big Pooh released The Purple Tape mixtape as a free download. This mixtape featured Big Pooh rhyming over Detroit-based producer Black Milk's instrumentals from a collection that used Prince Purple Rain album samples. 9th Wonder has produced songs for major artists like Jay-Z, De La Soul, Kendrick Lamar, Rapsody and Destiny's Child, as well as underground artists such as Sean Price and Wale. 9th Wonder has produced entire, full-length studio albums for Jean Grae (Jeanius), Murs (Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition), Buckshot (Chemistry and The Formula), as well as a remix album of Nas' God's Son entitled God's Stepson. =Leftback album, hiatus, and disbandment= During a May 2008 interview with HipHopGame.com, Rapper Big Pooh hinted that he and Phonte may never record another album together: In June 2009, Phonte announced the forthcoming Little Brother album, Leftback, but also announced that the group would subsequently take a Black Star-esque hiatus, wherein he and Big Pooh would continue to collaborate on projects, but that another group album would not be released for a long while. Shortly before the April 2010 release of what would become Little Brother's final studio album, Leftback, Phonte and 9th Wonder exchanged pointed Twitter messages regarding Little Brothers' release of a previously unreleased 9th Wonder produced single, \\"Star\\", on the Leftback album. Shortly after the release of Leftback on April 10, 2010, Little Brother formally announced the group's breakup. Rapper Big Pooh noted: Phonte added: =Reunion & May The Lord Watch= The reunion of Little Brother was, in part, due to the death of Phife Dawg in 2016. At this time Rapper Big Pooh and Phonte had not spoken in 5 years. Pooh sent Phonte a short message of love and appreciation. Phonte followed this text with a phone call where the two were said to have spoken for several hours. This and many followup conversations allowed the duo to rekindle their friendship. Phonte, Rapper Big Pooh and 9th Wonder reunited on stage together for the first time in eleven years at their hometown in the 2018 Art of Cool Festival. This reunion was the result of Royce da 5'9\\" being unable to attend the festival. According to Phonte, he was contacted by the promoters to substitute for Royce and called Pooh and 9th to collaborate with him. The group had not performed together in over a decade, so they performed many of their known hits including \\"Say it Again,\\" \\"Loving It\\", \\"The Way You Do It,\\" and \\"Dreams.\\" Both artists felt that the energy from the show was a good omen, and after leaving the stage they knew they had something special. Following this performance, Phonte invited Pooh to a barbeque at his home where they decided to continue the collaboration. In May 2019, it was revealed that Little Brother was to return and release new music later in the year, announcing their appearance at the upcoming Hopscotch Music Festival at September 7, 2019 in Raleigh, North Carolina. However, it was also revealed that 9th Wonder would not be returning as a third member of the group, with Phonte and Rapper Big Pooh continuing under the name; as they have been doing since 2007. On August 19, 2019, it was announced that Little Brother will be releasing a new album, titled \\"May the Lord Watch\\", which was released the following day on the 20th. The album continues and updates the fictional UBN channel concept that was originally used for their well-known sophomore effort The Minstrel Show, and features no production from 9th Wonder; instead, working with producers such as Khrysis, Nottz, Focus and Black Milk. The album was completed in secret with many artists who featured on the album not knowing that they were contributing to a Little Brother album. The album was also remarkable for killing the singer Percy Miracles, who was an alter ego of Phonte. The first skit on the album features DJ Peter Rosenberg discussing the death of Percy. This concept was a tribute to the fact that the death of Phife Dawg was the event that brought the Phonte and Pooh back together. It was revealed in an interview on the Premium Pete Show that 9th Wonder was to have been a part of the reunion album, under its original title Homecoming. The title was changed due to Beyonce releasing Homecoming: The Live Album to coincide with her concert film Homecoming. Phonte and Pooh decided to continue the project without 9th after several disagreements over production and touring commitments.

Geography View from Alishan. Formosan cypress. Alishan is in area. Notable characteristics include mountain wilderness, four villages, waterfalls, high altitude tea plantations, the Alishan Forest Railway, and a number of hiking trails. The area is popular with tourists and mountain climbers. Alishan, itself has become one of the major landmarks associated with Taiwan. The area is famous for its production of high mountain tea and wasabi. Alishan is well known for its sunrises, and on a suitable morning one can observe the sun come up on a sea of clouds in the area between Alishan and Y√ºshan. Alishan, along with Taroko Gorge and Sun Moon Lake, is one of Taiwan's most popular scenic attractions. Climate Alishan National Scenic Area spans a broad range in altitude. Lower elevations, such as in Leye Township, share the same subtropical and tropical climate as the rest of southern Taiwan, while the climate changes to temperate and alpine as the elevation increases. Snow sometimes falls at higher elevations in the winter. Alishan National Scenic Area covers most, but not all, of Alishan Rural Township in Chiayi County, as well as parts of neighboring townships in Taiwan. Average temperatures are moderate: * Low elevations: 24 ¬∞C in the summer, 16 ¬∞C in the winter. * Medium elevations: 19 ¬∞C in the summer, 12 ¬∞C in the winter. * High elevations: 14 ¬∞C in the summer, 5 ¬∞C in the winter.

Boardwalk at Alishan National Scenic Area. Tsou Cultural Park. The Alishan area was originally settled by the Tsou tribe of the Taiwanese aborigines; the name derives from the aboriginal word Jarissang. Ethnic Han Chinese settlers first settled on the plains near modern-day Chiayi as early as the late Ming Dynasty (around the mid-17th century), but did not move into the mountains until the late 18th century, establishing the towns of Ruili (ÁëûÈáå), Ruifeng (ÁëûÂ≥∞), Xiding (ÈöôÈ†Ç), and Fenqihu (Â•ÆËµ∑Êπñ). The resulting armed clashes between the settlers and the aborigines pushed the aborigines even further into the mountains. Following the cession of Taiwan to Japan at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War, Japanese expeditions to the area found large quantities of cypress (Ê™úÊú®, or hinoki in Japanese). This led to the development of the logging industry in the area and the export of local cypress and Taiwania wood. A series of narrow-gauge railways were built in the area during this time to facilitate the transportation of lumber from the mountains to the plains below, part of which continues to operate as the Alishan Forest Railway. Several new villages also began to sprout up along the railway lines. It was also during this time that the first tourists began to visit the area. Plans were even drawn up to incorporate the area into the new Niitaka (New Highest) Arisan National Park (Êñ∞È´òÈòøÈáåÂ±±ÂõΩÁ´ãÂÖ¨Âúí). With the exhaustion of forest resources by the 1970s, domestic and international tourism overtook logging to become the primary economic activity in the area. The tourism industry continued to expand with the completion of the Alishan highway in the 1980s, displacing the railroad as the primary mode of transportation up the mountain. To combat the problems associated with the growing crowds of tourists and the expanding tea and wasabi plantations, the area was declared a national scenic area in 2001. On 1 December 2014, fire broke out at Alishan spreading over more than 5 hectares of land. The area affected was located near Tapang No. 3 Bridge. The fire was believed to happen due to dry ground which was vulnerable to fire because of the absence of rain in the area for months. Attractions and landmarks Fenqihu (Â•ÆËµ∑Êπñ) is a small town of low wooden buildings built into the mountainside at 1,400 meters, midpoint of the Alishan Forest Railway. It is famous for natural rock formations, mountain streams, forests, and the ruins of a Shinto temple in the vicinity, as well as for its production of high altitude food products such as bamboo shoots and aiyu jelly (ÊÑõÁéâ). The local box lunches (Â•ÆËµ∑Êπñ‰æøÁï∂, Fenqihu bento) are known across Taiwan and are sold from stalls at the train station and from Fenqihu Hotel on the Fenqihu Old Street Fenqihu is currently the terminal end of the Alishan Forest Railway line from Chiayi to Alishan, since the railway was heavily damaged by Typhoon Morakot in 2009 and only the Chiayi to Fenqihu portion was reopened in 2014.https://www.ali- nsa.net/user/Article.aspx?Lang=2&SNo;=04005405 See also * National parks of Taiwan * Alishan Range * Alishan Forest Railway * List of tourist attractions in Taiwan References Bibliography External links Alishan Township Office *Alishan National Scenic Area Official Website Protected areas of Taiwan Geography of Chiayi County Tourist attractions in Chiayi County ","title":"Alishan National Scenic Area"},{"id":"989848","title":"Muriel Hurtis-Houairi"},{"id":"989851","text":"Spring Arbor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Jackson County in the U.S. state of Michigan.

The development of such a village began but ended with the departure of the Free Will Baptists' seminary to what is now Hillsdale College. Remnants of this plot are clearly visible on an aerial view of the area: a portion of Matthews Road continues along a street directed at the intersections of Cross and Hammond. Falling Waters Park can be found at this former establishment with historical information about the area including the Potawatomi village, the founding of the village of Spring Arbor, the 1835 founding of what would eventually become Albion College, and the 1844 founding of the predecessor of both Hillsdale College and Spring Arbor University.
