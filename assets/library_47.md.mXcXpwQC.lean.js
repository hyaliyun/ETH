The trials were largely conducted from 1944 to 1949, with subsequent legal action continuing for decades afterward. Unlike the Nuremberg Trials, the √©puration l√©gale was conducted as a domestic French affair. Approximately 300,000 cases were investigated, reaching into the highest levels of the collaborationist Vichy government. More than half were closed without indictment. From 1944 to 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for treason and other offenses. Only 791 executions were actually carried out, including those of Pierre Laval, Joseph Darnand, and the journalist Robert Brasillach; far more common was \\"national degradation\\" ‚Äî a loss of civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.Judt, Tony, Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, Pimlico (London: 2007), p. 46. Immediately following the liberation, France was swept by a wave of executions, public humiliations, assaults and detentions of suspected collaborators, known as the √©puration sauvage (wild purge).Jackson (2003), p. 577 This period succeeded the German occupational administration but preceded the authority of the French Provisional Government, and consequently lacked any form of institutional justice.Jackson (2003), p. 577 Reliable statistics of the death toll do not exist. At the low end, one estimate is that approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. \\"The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by de Gaulle, and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the √©puration sauvage\\",Jackson (2003), p. 577 notably including members and leaders of the milices. US forces put the number of \\"summary executions\\" following liberation at 80,000. The French Minister of the Interior in March 1945 claimed that the number executed was 105,000.  Background  The term purge () had been used earlier by de Gaulle under different circumstances. When the Allies arrived in November 1942, North Africa supported Vichy. In 1942, before the Allied landings in North Africa, there were two French organizations opposed to the Vichy regime-- the Free French under General de Gaulle from London and Brazzaville, and the French armed forces in North Africa under the Henri Giraud in Algiers. Giraud had assumed command upon the assassination of Francois Darlan, formerly Prime Minister under Philippe Petain's Vichy regime. De Gaulle was bitterly opposed to anyone with connections to Vichy, and opposed Giraud's nomination, and also called for an of anyone who collaborated with Vichy. By March 1943, Giraud started to become more critical of Vichy (notably in a speech written by advisor Jean Monnet). By June, the two branches of Free France merged into one, creating the French Committee of National Liberation.  Context  De Gaulle during World War II; he typically wore the uniform of a Brigade general P√©tain meeting Hitler on 24 October 1940. Following the liberation of France, the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF) led by Charles de Gaulle was faced with rebuilding the country and removing traitors, criminals and collaborators from office. The Comit√© Fran√ßais de Lib√©ration Nationale (CFLN), which became the GPRF on 4 June 1944, issued an ordinance in Algiers on 18 August 1943, setting the basis for the judicial purge and establishing a Purge Commission (Commission d'Epuration). The official purge in metropolitan France began in early 1945, although isolated civil trials, courts martial, and thousands of extra-legal vigilante actions had already been carried out through 1944, as the nation had been freed. Women accused of \\"horizontal collaboration\\" were arrested, shaved, exhibited, and sometimes mauled by crowds after Liberation, as punishment for their sexual relationships with Germans during the occupation. In another example of action before the purge, following the landings in North Africa in November 1942, some important civil servants loyal to Vichy, including Pierre Pucheu, former Minister of the Interior, had been detained. Pucheu was indicted for treason by a military court martial at the end of August 1943, and his trial started on 4 March 1944. He was executed 20 days later.Pierre Buttin, Le proc√®s Pucheu, Paris, Amiot-Dumont, 1948Fred Kupferman, Le proc√®s de Vichy : Pucheu, P√©tain, Laval, Bruxelles, Editions Complexe, 1980 Organized implementation of the official purge was made difficult by the lack of untainted magistrates. With a single exception, all of the Third Republic's surviving judges had taken an oath to the disgraced regime of Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Three major types of civilian courts were set up: * the High Court of Justice (Haute Cour de justice) * the Cours de justice, modeled on the Cour d'assises (Assize Court) * and the \\"Civic Chambers\\" (Chambres civiques) A fourth category was the military courts martial. This jurisdiction covered French citizens charged with pro-German military acts, and German nationals charged with war crimes, such as Pierre Pucheu, Minister of the Interior of Vichy, and Otto Abetz, ambassador of Nazi Germany to Paris. The High Court judged 108 persons (including 106 Ministers). In total the courts investigated more than 300,000 people, classifying 180,000 of them without any indictment, and finally fewer than 800 executions were enacted. Three successive general amnesties were enacted, in 1947, 1951 and 1953.  Legal basis  While the laws of 1939 included provisions against treason, the particular nature of events related to the Occupation of France made a number of offenses legally unclear, such as joining the SS or the paramilitary Milice. Hence, exceptional legal procurements were made. The principles set unanimously by the Conseil National de la R√©sistance (National Council of Resistance, CNR) on 15 March 1944 called for the political elimination of any person guilty of collaboration with the Nazis between 16 June 1940 and the Liberation. Such offences included, notably: * Taking part in collaborationist organizations or parties * Taking part in propaganda * Delation (denunciation) * Any form of zeal in favor of the Germans * Black market activities On the other hand, preventing a civil war meant that competent civil servants should not be taken out of office, and that moderate sentences should be given where possible. More importantly, this prevented local Resistance movements from doing vigilante \\"justice\\" themselves, ending the \\"combative\\" period of the Liberation and restoring the proper legal institutions of France. These new institutions were set on three principles: * Illegality of the Vichy regime * France still being at war with Nazi Germany: the Franco-German armistice legally called for a cease fire and an end to military operations, but did not end the state of war, and no peace treaty was signed with Germany. Hence, it remained the duty of any French to resist occupation. * Retroactivity of the new texts On 26 August 1944, the government published an order defining the offence of indignit√© nationale (\\"national unworthiness\\"), and the corresponding punishment of d√©gradation nationale (\\"national stripping of rank\\"). Indignit√© nationale was characterised as \\"harming unity of France and neglecting one's national duty\\", and the sentence aimed in particular in prohibiting guilty individuals of exercising political functions. On 18 November, the Haute Cour de Justice (\\"High Court of Justice\\") was created, with the aim of judging members of the Vichy government charged of offences of Indignit√© nationale (Marshal Philippe P√©tain, etc.) Other suspects were judged by the cours de justice (\\"Courts of Justice\\"). A High Court of Justice already existed under the Third Republic: the Senate was then to organise a court to judge state leaders guilty of high treason. But this form of justice had been suppressed by Marshal P√©tain's Fifth Constitutional Act of 30 July 1940, establishing the Vichy regime. The new High Court was not composed anymore of senators, but presided over by the first President of the Court of Cassation, assisted by the President of the Criminal Chamber of the Court of Cassation and by the first President of the Appeal Court of Paris. It was also composed of 24 juries, randomly chosen on two lists of a dozen each. The first list included 40 senators or deputies in function on 1 September 1939, who had not voted the full powers to P√©tain on 10 July 1940 (the Vichy 80). The second list was composed of 50 persons chosen by the Consultative Assembly in Resistance movements. The composition of the High Court was changed again by 27 December 1945 Act. Thereafter, it was composed of 27 members, three magistrates and 24 juries randomly chosen on a list of 96 deputies of the Constituent Assembly, elected on 21 October 1945. Each political party was represented on this list proportionally to its presence in the Assembly. The High Court was further modified by 15 September 1947 Act, and then again by 19 April 1948 Act.  Internment of accused  The French concentration camps used by the Vichy regime to intern Jews, Gipsies, Spanish Republicans, Resistants and others, were now used to detain presumed collaborationists. In Paris, these included the Velodrome d'Hiver, the Drancy internment camp (managed by the Resistance until the arrival of the gendarmerie on 15 September 1944) and the Fresnes prison, which held Tino Rossi, Pierre Benoit, Arletty, and the industrialist Louis Renault. The 4 October 1944 ordinance authorised prefects to intern dangerous prisoners until the end of hostilities. For some Collaborationists, internment meant protection from popular vengeance. On 31 October 1944, the Minister of Interior Adrien Tixier created commissions charged with controlling the internment camps and home confinements. The Red Cross was permitted to visit the camps. Tixier then stated on 30 August 1945 that although the war was not yet officially ended, further internments were prohibited except for cases of spying or major black marketeering. The 10 May 1946 Act fixed the legal date of the end of the war, and at the end of May 1946, all internment camps were cleared.  Trials  The first high official tried in the purge was Jean- Pierre Esteva, Resident General of France in Tunisia. He was sentenced to detention for life on 15 March 1945, avoiding capital punishment because the court recognised that he had assisted patriots in May 1943, just before quitting Tunisia. In state of illness, Esteva was pardoned on 11 August 1950 and died a few months later. The trial of P√©tain began on 23 July 1945. P√©tain's defense lawyer, Jacques Isorni, pointed out that the public prosecutor, Andr√© Mornet, had also been in charge of the failed Riom Trials organized by P√©tain under the Vichy regime. This may not have impressed the judge, Pierre Mongibeaux, who had sworn allegiance to Petain in 1941. The 89-year-old Marshal was sentenced to death on 15 August but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He lived six more years, banished to the √éle d'Yeu. Pierre Laval as seen in Frank Capra documentary film Divide and Conquer (1943) Pierre Laval, the French Prime Minister from July to December 1940 and from April 1942 to August 1944, had fled to Francoist Spain. Franco sent him back to Innsbruck in Austria, which was part of the U.S. Occupation Zone. Laval was handed over to the French authorities and his trial started in October 1945. In a hasty, rancorous trial, he was sentenced by an openly hostile jury to death on 9 October 1945 and killed a week later. By 1 July 1949, the High Court had given out 108 sentences, 106 against former ministers: * In eight cases, the defendants had died before their trials and judicial proceedings were stopped, including that of Jean Bichelonne. * Three persons, including Marcel Peyrouton, were acquitted and 42 were given non- lieux (similar to acquittals), including Jacques Le Roy Ladurie and J√©r√¥me Carcopino, Minister of National Education in Fran√ßois Darlan's cabinet (1941‚Äì1942). * Eighteen were sentenced to death, of whom three were carried out on Pierre Laval, Milice leader Joseph Darnand and Fernand de Brinon, representative of the Vichy government to the German High Command in Paris and state secretary. Five sentences were commuted, among them P√©tain, Henri Dentz, commander of the Army of the Levant and Rapha√´l Alibert, signatory of the first Statute on Jews. Ten others were condemned to death in absentia (including Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Commissioner for Jewish Affairs). * Eight men were sentenced to forced labour, Jacques Chevalier, Minister Paul Baudoin, Charles Nogues, Minister Gabriel Auphan, Minister Hubert Lagardelle and others. * Fourteen were imprisoned, including Yves Bouthillier, Andr√© Marquis, pr√©fet maritime of Toulon, Bl√©haut Henri and others; a life sentence was given to Jean-Pierre Esteva. * Fifteen sentences of d√©gradation nationale were issued, including Fran√ßois Pi√©tri, Vichy ambassador to Spain, and Adrien Marquet. Seven of the sentences were suspended for compensating \\"acts of Resistance\\", including those of Jean Ybarnegaray and Andr√© Parmentier. Between 1954 and 1960, the High Court judged prisoners who had been sentenced in absentia or had been taken prisoner. More than a decade having passed, the court showed more leniency. For example, the General resident of Morocco, Charles Nogu√®s, had been sentenced in absentia to 20 years of forced labour on 28 November 1947 but his indignit√© nationale was immediately suspended on 26 October 1956.

Its name is derived from the ancient Gaul tribe of Pictones. The county was bounded on the north by the Duchy of Brittany, the counties of Anjou and Touraine, on the east by the County of La Marche and on the south by the County of Angoul√™me. The seat of the county was at Poitiers. Poitou was ruled by the count of Poitou, a continuous line of which can be traced back to an appointment of Charlemagne in 778. From the 950s on, the counts were also dukes of Aquitaine. After the marriage of Eleanor of Aquitaine with Louis VII of France in 1138, the Seneschal of Poitou was responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the county. From 1154, through Eleanor's second marriage, Poitou passed to the kings of England. Poitou was conquered by King Philip II of France in 1205 after he declared it a confiscated fief of the crown. Henry III of England failed to retake it in the Saintonge War. One of the main battlegrounds of Hundred Years' War between the French and English in the 14th and 15th centuries, Poitou was finally absorbed into the Kingdom of France in 1416.

Israeli driver Asher Weisgan killed the men in an effort to derail the Israeli disengagement from Gaza. Shooting A father of two children, Asher Weisgan (born in ) was a resident of Shvut Rachel and a driver for Palestinian laborers near the West Bank Israeli settlement of Shilo, Mateh Binyamin. On 17 August 2005, sometime after 5:00P.M., Weisgan used a knife to steal a security guard's M16 rifle, and then killed four Palestinians before turning himself in to security. Weisgan was well- acquainted with the men, having known and eaten with them for years. The fatalities of the shooting were Mohammed Mansour (aged 48) and Bassam Tauase (aged 30), both from Nablus; Halil Salah (aged 42) from Qalqilya; and Osama Moussa Tawafsha (aged 33) from Sanjil, near Ramallah. Another man, Ruhi Qassam, was only wounded by Weisgan. Saying he had no regrets about his actions, Weisgan had wanted to spur an Arab reprisal, thereby engaging the Israel Defense Forces, and preventing the further removal of Israelis from their homes in the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria (as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza). Trial Weisgan was convicted of murder. On 27 September 2006, Weisgan was sentenced by the Jerusalem District Court to pay restitution of , and to four back-to-back life sentences plus twelve years. According to Israeli human rights groups, convictions were rare for Israelis who commit crimes in the West Bank. Imprisoned in Ayalon Prison, Weisgan committed suicide by hanging in his cell on 22 December 2006.

It supplies water to the South East Queensland region via the South East Queensland Water Grid. The plant first supplied water to the grid in February 2009. It is owned by Seqwater and operated by Veolia. The plant is currently in 'hot standby' mode, which means it is not in permanent use but is capable of being brought back on line when needed.  Project rationale and background  Water supplies in south east Queensland reached very low levels during Australia's 'Millennium drought', primarily from 2003 to 2009. The region's major water storages reached around 50% of capacity in mid-2005 and 20% in mid-2007. In response to this worsening situation a range of water infrastructure projects were proposed to bolster supplies in south east Queensland. The Gold Coast City Council initially developed a plan for a 55 ML/day desalination plant during 2005., which was anticipated to cost around $260 million. Due to worsening drought conditions, in 2006 the Queensland Government joined with the Gold Coast to expand the plan to a 133 ML/day plant that could share output with the entire region. The Queensland Government contributed $869 million to the expanded project, which was to be developed through a 50:50 joint venture.  Design and construction   Construction partners  The construction process was led by a group known as the Gold Coast Desalination Alliance. It consists of Veolia Water, John Holland Group, Sinclair Knight Merz and Cardno.  Site selection  Investigations by the Gold Coast Desalination Alliance identified 13 possible sites of which three, Pimpama, Coombabah and Bilinga, were short-listed. The Gold Coast City Council chose Bilinga as the most suitable site for the desalination plant due to being closest to the coast, having low environmental impact and cost, and being best suited to achieving a timely construction process. This choice was aligned with community values and expectations ‚Äì community consultation conducted prior to construction highlighted that environmental impacts and cost were the most important issues when considering the location of the proposed plant. The Bilinga site is compatible with surrounding land use, requires the shortest intake and outlet pipelines of the three site options and the inlet and outlet pipes cross a minor fault line.  Design  The plant is a 'two-pass' reverse osmosis desalination plant. The first pass removes salt, minerals and other microscopic particles, while the second pass targets boron and bromide specifications suitable for drinking water. As well as the core desalination equipment, the project includes 1.5 kilometre marine intake and outlet tunnels, a 25 kilometre pipeline to connect to the South East Queensland Water Grid at Worongary, a pump station and a small reservoir.  Construction process and timeline  The project schedule was approximately: * August to November 2006: initial design * October 2006 to July 2008: tunnels and shafts * November 2006 to June 2008: desalination plant * July 2008 to November 2008: commissioning * October 2008 to January 2009: optimisation. The plant produced its first water in November 2008 and began supplying water to the grid in February 2009. Defects In January 2009, rust and valve problems delayed the plant's opening. The plant began operations in February 2009 and has been operating according to grid instructions since that time, except for a five- week shutdown in May 2009 and a three-month shutdown from June to August 2010 to repair previously identified defects. During the initial shutdown a formal investigation of these problems was undertaken. In June 2009 some further faults were identified, all bar one of which have now been rectified with the final piece of work to be completed by the end of August 2010. These defects do not affect the plant's ability to produce clean safe water but had implications for its long term viability. The Queensland Government has refused to accept ownership of the plant until all problems are rectified.  Awards  It is the first large-scale desalination plant on Australia's eastern seaboard and was named Membrane Desalination Plant of the Year (2009) at the Global Water Awards.  Possible future expansion  There is potential to increase output to 167 megalitres a day. However the plant was identified as a reserve, rather than priority, site on the Queensland Government's list of possible sites for future desalination plants. Lytton and either Marcoola or Bribie Island are the priority sites. The plant was officially handed over to the Queensland Government agency WaterSecure in October 2010. Since 1 July 2011 it is owned by Seqwater. Environmental concerns Ongoing monitoring is undertaken at the plant as part of its environmental licence. Underwater footage shows an abundance of marine life is now active around artificial reefs that have been created on the marine structures. Community groups such as the Queensland Conservation Council and GECKO have expressed concern over environmental issues with the project. Desalination is an electricity-intensive way to produce water. The plant uses around 3.58 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity for every cubic metre (kilolitre) of water it produces. To offset the carbon emissions associated with this electricity consumption, the plant operators purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs). The RECs have been produced by a range of renewable energy sources with the main source being solar hot water system installations. Other sources include solar photovoltaic, hydro and a small amount of wind. Mothballing Soon after being commissioned, rainfall and water storages increased in south east Queensland. Three major storages, Wivenhoe, Somerset Dam and North Pine dams, approached 80% of capacity in mid-2009 and reached 100% by the end of 2010. Due to the availability of ample water in south east Queensland's dams, water supply costs and impacts on household water bills could be reduced by minimising the plant's operations. On 5 December 2010, then Natural Resources Minister, Stephen Robertson confirmed the plant would go into standby mode that month as a cost-saving measure. The plant has been used for brief periods since 2010 for a range of contingencies. For example: * in January 2013 it returned briefly to 100% operation to supply drinking water during the flooding of South-East Queensland due to Cyclone Oswald * during September 2015 it returned to service when the Mudgeeraba water treatment plant was being refurbished * during August 2016 it supplied around 360 ML of water while the Molendinar water treatment plant was being refurbished. Between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2015 the plant supplied less than 9 GL of water, which is less than 5% of its theoretical maximum output over a four year period. Although currently on 'hot standby', the plant plays an important role in Seqwater's plans to manage future droughts. Seqwater's 2015 plan, Water for life, identifies that when regional water storages reach 60% the plant will return to service at 33% of capacity, and if storages reach 40% it will operate at 100% of capacity.

Racesafe was formed following initial meetings with the newly formed Motor Circuit Racing Control Board in October 1995. Subsequently the first marshal training day was held in February 1996 at Donington Park and the first meeting marshalled by Racesafe took place at Donington in April of that year. Racesafe was created one year after the Motor Circuit Racing Control Board (MCRCB), which was formed to run the newly inaugurated British Superbike Championship for the 1995 season. Previously in the UK, national championship races had been organised under the auspices of the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU), with individual rounds marshalled by members of clubs local to the circuits where they took place. The intention of the MCRCB was to run a more commercial championship series than had previously been the case. With this objective a new marshals' organisation was convened, with the aim of ensuring that the marshalling was of a high and consistent standard at all championship rounds. This remains the aim of the association. Organisation of Racesafe was loosely based on the system of marshalling for car racing in the United Kingdom, in that training was compulsory for all marshals, and that training had to repeated at intervals to remain a member. Up to 2011 Racesafe marshals were required to retrain every two years to remain members. At the end of 2011 this requirement was changed to every three years for marshals who have completed two training days and perform satisfactorily at the required number of events. On-line training and testing was introduced in 2013 for fully experienced marshals. Racesafe also introduced compulsory uniforms for marshals and issued all those completing training with an association membership card which could be used to marshal at any British Superbike round, a training record card, and for novice marshals an attendance card. Racesafe Marshals who have completed their first training day are considered to be novices until they have completed at least 12 days marshalling and a second training day. In 2018 Racesafe Marshals Association are responsible for supplying marshals to the British Superbike championship, the World Superbike Championship round at Donington Park, and the UK MotoGP round at Silverstone.

Tap pants, also known as side-cut shorts or dance shorts, are a form of lingerie designed for women, similar to French knickers in appearance. As the name implies, they are a type of shorts, in that they cover the pelvic area and the upper part of the upper legs. The name originates from shorts worn by tap dancers during the 1930s while practicing their routines. Tap pants are mostly made of lace, silk, satin, polyester, rayon and cotton voile. Some pairs may be trimmed in ruffles. Tap pants look much like track shorts, allow freedom of movement, and can be worn as an outer garment over other types of underwear (e.g., g-strings), however they are mostly worn as innerwear or leisure wear. From a distance, tap pants can be mistaken for a half slip. Tap pants generally hang loose around the body.

It won its only Cork Senior Club Football Championship in 1897. Other titles won include 2 Cork Intermediate Football Championships in 1972 and 1995, and 3 Cork Junior Football Championships in 1935, 1966, and 1993. In 2007, the club won its first ever county hurling championship when it won the Cork Junior B Hurling Championship. The club is part of the Carbery division of Cork. The Sam Maguire Cup which is presented to the All-Ireland winning football team each year is named after Dunmanway's most famous son, Sam Maguire who is buried in St. Mary's Graveyard. History Dohenys GAA club was founded in 1886. The first chairman of the club was a local national school teacher, John Mc Carthy, while the first secretary was Richard Hayes. The club attended the first meeting of the Cork County Board and became the first affiliated club in West Cork. The official name adopted by the club was the Michael Doheny Football Club after the Tipperary Young Irelander, Michael Doheny, who spent a short time in Dunmanway when on 'the run' in 1847. In 1897 the club established a very solid foundation when it won the Cork Senior Football Championship by defeating Wolf Tones of Kanturk in the final. This team, captained by Danny Rick O' Donovan of the Shamrock Bar, won its way through Munster Senior Football Championship but was defeated by Kickhams of Dublin in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final at Jones‚Äô Road, a game played in February 1899. Although defeated this team established a tradition, which has stood well to the club over the years and guaranteed its survival during difficult times in the years following. In its 127 year history the club has played a significant role in the affairs of the G.A.A. both in West Cork and the County. Although no further senior title has been won the club has won Cork Intermediate Football Championship titles in 1972 and 1995, and Cork Junior Football Championship titles in 1935, 1966 and 1993. Its under-age teams have won county titles in U16 football in 1999, Under 18 hurling in 2003, and U14 hurling in 2001. Many West Cork titles at all levels, in both football and hurling, have also been won.

It was marked by the death of Robert the Strong, the Neustrian margrave, and Ranulf I, the duke of Aquitaine. In 866, Salomon, Duke of Brittany, allied with Hastein (Hasting), a Danish chieftain, for an expedition into Anjou, Maine, and Touraine. In the course of the campaign, Le Mans was sacked. Robert, commander of the afflicted regions, assembled a large army to expel them. He was joined by Ranulf of the region of Poitou and by Gauzfrid and Herv√© of Maine. The Frankish army succeeded in intercepting the Danes before they reached their boats on the Loire River. The Danes attempted to take refuge in a church, but the Franks besieged them. During the night, the Danes attempted to escape. During the ensuing battle, Robert was killed, Ranulf mortally wounded by an arrow, and Herv√© injured. With the loss of their leaders, the Franks had to retreat. In 867, Charles the Bald entered negotiations with Salomon and recognised him as King of Brittany. He conceded the Cotentin and possibly the Avranchin to the Breton. Hastein continued to ravage the Loire Valley for many more years. He and his forces attacked Bourges in 867, Orl√©ans in 868, and Angers in 872. Charles appealed for assistance to Salomon.

By definition, cells in a side population have distinguishing biological characteristics (for example, they may exhibit stem cell-like characteristics), but the exact nature of this distinction depends on the markers used in identifying the side population. Examples Side populations were first identified in hematopoietic stem cells by Dr. Margaret Goodell.http://jem.rupress.org/content/183/4/1797.short SPs have been identified in hepatocellular carcinomas and may be the cells that efflux chemotherapy drugs, accounting for the resistance of cancer to chemotherapy. Recent studies on testicular stem cells indicate that more than 40% of the SP (defined in this case as cells that show higher efflux of DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342) was undifferentiated spermatogonia, while other differentiated fractions were represented by only 0.2%. SP cells can rapidly efflux lipophilic fluorescent dyes to produce a characteristic profile based on fluorescence-activated flow cytometric analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated SP cells in bone marrow obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that these cells might be candidate leukemic stem cells, and recent studies have found a SP of tumor progenitor cells in human solid tumors. These new data indicate that the ability of malignant SP cells to expel anticancer drugs may directly improve their survival and sustain their clonogenicity during exposure to cytostatic drugs, allowing disease recurrence when therapy is withdrawn. Identification of a tumor progenitor population with intrinsic mechanisms for cytostatic drug resistance might also provide clues for improved therapeutic intervention. The molecules involved in effluxing Hoechst 33342 are members of the ATP-binding cassette family, such as MDR1 (P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2.

The station schedule consists of a wide range of music and talk programming serving the campus and Madison community. History The radio station, which was known as WLHA, began in 1952, but went off the air in 1993. It restarted when a group of volunteers, including Stephen Thompson, a member of a former student radio group, founder of the Onion AV page and now of National Public Radio, and Dean Troyer, the newly elected Student Services Finance Chair, submitted a budget and proposal to the SSFC, the Associated Students of Madison and the UW‚ÄìMadison administration. Dr. James Hoyt, former chair of the UW‚ÄìMadison School of Journalism, and General Manager Dave Black, a journalism graduate student at the university, were asked to lead the effort to bring a student radio station back to UW-Madison. The university approved the project in June, 1995. The key to the proposal was getting Dr. Hoyt and Dave Black involved to add long-term stability to the project and getting the administration to apply for the FCC license. The station began in 1997 with an internet-only broadcast. In 2001, the FCC agreed to a radio tower to be built in the town of Montrose in southern Dane County. The proposal was met with contention from local citizens of Montrose, but after a lengthy legal battle, the tower was constructed and terrestrial broadcasting of WSUM began on February 22, 2002, at 2:22 PM. Since then, WSUM has expanded to near-24/7 programming. The station currently has over 250 members. Programming WSUM prides itself on the wide variety of programming it provides the community. Programming on WSUM is entirely free-form, in that hosts are allowed to completely program their own show. Programming schedules operate on a semesterly schedule. A typical schedule consists of a variety of sports, talk shows, and music shows, including indie rock, funk, house music, folk, and community affairs. Most of the programmers are students (of any area college), although there are some community members with shows.  On Wisconsin Radio  On Wisconsin Radio is the station's flagship public affairs program. The show covers the Badgers and everything Wisconsin, featuring the latest in political news, sports, music, culture, and community events through quality journalism, creative pre- production and energetic live performance. Previous guests include politicians Senator Tammy Baldwin, Mary Burke, and Madison mayor Paul Soglin, comedians Julian McCullough, Christopher Titus, Steve Byrne, and Adam Cayton-Holland, and former Green Bay Packer Ahman Green. The podcast debuted in February 2015. It quickly gained popularity in the city of Madison, and was an Isthmus Favorites Reader's Choice Award Top 3 Finalist. Student Staff Educating future broadcasters is one of the core objectives of WSUM, according to its mission statement. As such, the staff at WSUM operates much as a professional radio station. The station manager is elected each year in November by the members of WSUM, while the rest of the staff is hired by the station manager. The program director is primarily in charge of scheduling shows and training future hosts each semester. The music director is primarily in charge of talking to promoters and planning Snake on the Lake. The production director creates on-air fare for the station. The general manager, currently David Black, oversees the student staff and liaises with the administration for budget and other issues. WSUM sports The award-winning WSUM Sports Department provides UW-Madison students exceptional hands-on experience in the field of sports broadcasting. WSUM Sports offers numerous sports talk shows throughout the week, all of which are entirely produced and hosted by students. In addition, WSUM provides live play-by-play coverage of Wisconsin football, men's and women's basketball, and men's and women's hockey on its online sports stream. The station also has an exclusive partnership with www.UWBadgers.com, the official website of Wisconsin athletics, to broadcast Badger softball and women's hockey games. In January 2010, the WSUM Sports Department began an exclusive partnership to provide the on-air talent for the Big Ten Network as a part of its \\"Student-U\\" initiative.http://wsum.org/the- station/sports-department/ Online sports stream The WSUM online sports stream launched in October, 2008, with a broadcast of Wisconsin vs. Ohio State in football. Coverage has since expanded to include men's and women's basketball, men's and women's hockey, and women's softball. In October, 2009, WSUM Sports traveled to Minneapolis to broadcast its first road game: Wisconsin vs. Minnesota football. WSUM has since covered every Wisconsin football road Big Ten game, select away men's basketball games, The Rose Bowl, The Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, Women's Hockey Frozen Four, WCHA Final Five, and The 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Party in the Park Each year, WSUM puts together a free music festival that is funded through donations and fundraising events. The event was originally known as Party in the Park and was held in James Madison Park, near the UW‚ÄìMadison Campus. The festival has drawn bands from around the country including The White Stripes, Andrew WK, ‚Ä¶And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead.

It became Ford's flagship in that country. It was based on the U.S. 1966 Ford Galaxie. It was only offered as a 4-door sedan, although the American version was offered in a wide variety of bodystyles. After 1976, it gained more differences from the Galaxie and LTD, and featured the newly introduced 302 engine, a lighter 5.0L V8, and its radical restyling clearly resembling the 1965 Lincoln Continental. American origin, Brazilian style The Landau joined the existing models Galaxie 500 and LTD in the showrooms in 1976 as Ford's new top-of-the-range model. All three models featured the new 302 CID engine with 4942 cc and , which replaced the heavier 292, but the Galaxie and LTD kept their design elements from the American original. Initially the Landau offered in the single colour scheme ‚ÄúPrata Continental‚Äù (Continental Silver), an exclusive metallic clearcoat. The vinyl roof was painted silver coloured too. Trivia On June 25, 1979, during the oil crisis in Brazil, Ford includes in Galaxie/ Landau range an 302 CID engine with higher compression ratio (11,0:1 vs. 7,8:1), and that made use of true dual exhaust, aluminum intake manifold and nickel-covered carburetor, to accept the use of Ethanol (sugar cane alcohol).

Although the South Dakota state capital is Pierre, South Dakota, the state's Adjutant General has his office and headquarters in Camp Rapid. Background Camp Rapid developed as a summer encampment site for the South Dakota National Guard in the early 20th century, using land borrowed from the Bureau of Indian Affairs \\"Sioux Sanitorium\\" and Rapid City Indian School, today's Indian Health Service (IHS) SiouxSan Hospital, located just west of Camp Rapid. It became a permanent installation during and immediately after World War I, when it was used for mobilization of National Guard units for the front in France. Its use continued during the 1920s and 1930s, and it was taken over as a federal installation during World War II. Permanent and temporary buildings erected during World War II continue in use today. During the Cold War, Camp Rapid continued to host and support National Guard activities, including a series of annual exercises involving National Guard troops from many states conducting operations in the Black Hills. In the early 1990s, a new series of building projects replaced tent pads and brick and metal \\"tents\\" with permanent structures for use as armories, barracks, and support facilities. Security of the Camp was upgraded significantly in the early 2000s as part of nationwide security improvements.

The offence of Indignit√© nationale was meant to fill a legal void: while the laws in application in 1939 had provisions against treason, murder and such crimes, they did not take into account reprehensible behaviours which occurred during the Occupation and in the Vichy regime, such as participation in the Waffen SS or in the Milice. The bill of the \\"Ordinance Instituting National Indignity\\"Translation into English as in Kritz and Mandela p. 83. was presented by the Provisional Government of the French Republic government on June 26, 1944 and adopted by the National Assembly on August 26, 1944.Kritz and Mandela, pp. 83, 87-88. Indignit√© nationale ceased to be a criminal offense in January 1951 but the people convicted in 1944‚Äì1951 remained deprived of their civil rights until August 1953. History Gaullist legal preparations to post-war purges started in Lyon in 1942. Chief prosecutor for Paris Maurice Rolland joined the Lyon Commission in 1943.Kritz and Mandela, p. 81. Charles de Gaulle leaned to leave the post-war purification to ad hoc decisions of the judges, relying solely on the 1939 statute that punished treason with death. Meetings of the Consultative Assembly, which convened beginning on January 11, 1944, persuaded de Gaulle that \\"containing vengeance\\" would be more difficult than he thought.Kritz and Mandela, p. 82. Indeed, in the few months that followed the Normandy landings, at least 4,500 alleged collaborators were killed in summary judicial executions. De Gaulle and his government needed a legal instrument which, unlike the 1939 law on treason, would not involve harsh sentences and could thus be applied to a wide circle of offenders. They also wanted to avoid enacting an ex post facto law, and created the concept of continuing \\"state of indignity\\" as a workaround solution.Kritz and Mandela, p. 83. The new law instituted a new concept of a criminal state of a person, the state of indignity. A person entered the state of indignity through committing certain acts (not necessarily crimes) in the past, and this state continued until redemption through punishment. The acts leading to \\"state of indignity\\" included any voluntary aid to Axis powers after June 16, 1940, or any of numerous specific offences outlined in the law: * participation in the Vichy Cabinet; * executive posts in the Vichy propaganda or the Commisariat for Jewish Affairs; * active participation in pro-collaboration demonstrations; * mere membership in pro-collaboration organizations.Kritz and Mandela, p. 89. Those found guilty of indignit√© nationale were subject to a sentence of d√©gradation nationale and, from September 30, 1944, confiscation of property. The convicted offenders were reduced to a class of second-rate citizens, deprived of election rights, banned from government service, trade unions, mass media, and executive appointments in semi-public companies.Kritz and Mandela, p. 90. The duration of disqualification, from five years to life, was decided by the court on a case-by-case basis. The courts could suspend but not lift the penalty for those who served in the Free French Forces or participated in the Resistance. The courts were not allowed to choose a specific form of disqualification and had to invoke the whole set of bans or acquit the person. The only elective punishments were the confiscation of property and a ban on living in certain areas. The offenders also lost their pension rights, although this was not intended by the legislators and was uncommon in practice. By the beginning of 1951, when indignit√© nationale ceased to be a criminal offense, more than 46,000 people had been convicted: 3,158 by the Courts of Justice (counting only the cases where indignit√© nationale was the main offence) and 46,145 cases tried by the Civic Chambers. Only 3,184 people so charged were acquitted.Kritz and Mandela, p. 120. In 1953, all surviving convictees, except those convicted by the High Court, were amnestied of indignit√© nationale charges.Kritz and Mandela, p. 124.

(CARD) is among the largest autism treatment organizations in the world. Founded in 1990 by Doreen Granpeesheh, CARD provides a range of services for children and adults on the autism spectrum. These services include home-based, early intensive behavioral interventions based on the principles of applied behavior analysis (ABA), as well as diagnostic and psychological assessments. The Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, acquired CARD in 2018. Granpeesheh and the management at CARD invested in the company alongside Blackstone, and Granpeesheh remains the CEO of CARD. Theoretical assumptions CARDs philosophy and behavioral approach assumes the following to be true: * Recovery from autism exists. * All people within the autism spectrum are capable of learning. * Everything a person says or does is considered behavior. * Behavior can be improved and enhanced via learning opportunities. While Granpeesheh believes that all people with ASDs are capable of learning and recovery, she states there is currently no way to predict the outcome of treatment for any individual. Behavioral treatment CARD uses early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), that focuses on encouraging appropriate behaviors and replacing destructive behaviors while also teaching the child all the skills they are lacking, for as long as 30‚Äì40 hours per week. Most of the clients treated at CARD enter the program at age two and receive intensive services over the course of four years, with the ultimate goal of recovery at age six. For these children, the first year of treatment consists of intensive work on language and behavior with progression into social skills in the second year, more abstract cognitive and executive functioning skills in the third, and a gradual fade-out of services in the final year. The intensive services are usually provided initially in the child's home, with a transition to the child's school and community as the child's age allows. For older clients, aged ten to 21, CARD focuses on independent living skills, successful employment, development of leisure activities, friendships and attending school. The content of CARD's curriculum addresses all areas of human functioning across the following eight domains: language, play, social skills, motor, academic, adaptive skills, cognition and executive functioning. Clinical outcomes Methodological shortcomings, including unclear validity of the initial ABA diagnosis, limit any conclusion that can be made from the study. Documentary Staff members at CARD, as well as four families whose children received treatment from them, were featured in the documentary Recovered: Journeys Through the Autism Spectrum and Back. It was directed and edited by Michele Jaquis in collaboration with Granpeesheh.

Jackson after serving as lieutenant governor in exile. In 1864 he returned to the state, but was forced back into exile after the Battle of Westport. Reynolds was elected lieutenant governor in 1860 as a Douglas Democrat, privately supporting southern rights. When the Confederacy began to take shape in 1861, President Davis viewed the leaders of neutral Missouri with suspicion and initially refused to send military aid, so enabling the Union to dominate the state. Missouri's Confederate government fled to Arkansas, and Reynolds became demoralized and went to work in Richmond. Upon Governor Jackson‚Äôs death from cancer on December 6, 1862, Reynolds started planning the liberation of Missouri with Confederate Major-General Sterling Price. The planned expedition took place in 1864, but achieved nothing. After the American Civil War Reynolds fled to Mexico, returning to St. Louis in 1869. He jumped to his death there in 1887.  Early life and education  Reynolds was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1838 and received a doctor of laws degree, graduating summa cum laude, from Heidelberg University in 1842. He was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1844 and served as a charg√© d'affaires in Madrid before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1850. There he opened a law practice, served as United States Attorney, and rose in the Democratic Party, joining the anti-Benton wing when the party split over Senator Thomas Hart Benton‚Äôs failure to support the Southern side of the national debate in the late 1840s and early 1850s.Gerteis p. 66-68 Reynolds was fluent in German, as was his French-born wife. Early on in St. Louis, he had good relations with the influential German community. Republicans, however, consciously and aggressively pursued a Free Soil policy that fed on white fears that slavery and the Democratic Party would serve to debase white labor as it was forced to compete with slave labor. Reynolds, as a proslavery Democrat, lost the support of the German community and the Republican editor of the Missouri Democrat, Gratz Brown particularly drew Reynolds‚Äô ire. Reynolds challenged Brown to a duel in March 1855. This duel never happened, however, as Brown chose \\"the common American Rifle with open sights, round ball not over one ounce, at eighty yards.\\" Reynolds refused the terms because his short-sightedness would have put him at a severe disadvantage in making an accurate shot. The public attacks continued and Brown, chafing under Reynolds' accusations of cowardice for his manipulation to avoid the original duel, finally issued a challenge. Reynolds chose the more traditional dueling pistols and on August 26, 1856, the duel occurred on Bloody Island. Brown was shot in the leg (and was to walk with a limp for the rest of his life) while Reynolds was unscathed. Both returned to the political frayGerteis p. 69-71 and Brown would serve as Governor of Missouri from 1871 to 1873.  Lieutenant Governor of Missouri  In 1860, Reynolds was elected as lieutenant governor, serving along with Governor Claiborne F. Jackson, and assuming office in early 1861. The team, aware of the strong free soil sentiments of important factions of the Missouri electorate, had run as Douglas Democrats.Gerteis p. 66 Reynolds was an early leader of the secessionists in Missouri. On January 4, 1861, soon after his native South Carolina seceded, he called a meeting of secessionists in Jefferson City and began to help organize the Minutemen secessionist paramilitary organization at the same time Unionist companies, the \\"Home Guard\\" were being organized by Missouri Congressman Frank Blair, Jr. On January 8, Reynolds addressed a public meeting that adopted a resolution which said, in part, \\"We pledge Missouri to a hearty co-operation with our sister Southern States ‚Ä¶ for our mutual protection, against the encroachments of Northern fanaticism, and the co-ercion of the Federal Government.\\" On January 17, 1861, he made an influential speech before the Missouri Senate that led the way to the call for a state convention to consider secession.Castel p.9 At the beginning of the American Civil War, Missouri adopted a position that it would remain in the Union, but would not send troops or supplies to either side. Governor Jackson refused the call from President Lincoln to supply troops to the Union, and the Missouri General Assembly established the Missouri State Guard under Sterling Price to resist attempts to force the state to comply. Following the Camp Jackson Affair, when Union military troops and civilians clashed over the arrest of the Missouri Volunteer Militia, Price, Jackson, and Reynolds met on May 14, 1861, to discuss strategy. All appeared to agree with Reynolds that the best course was to organize the entire state militarily to resist any attempt by Lyons to occupy the state capital. On May 20 Price dispatched Reynolds to Richmond in order to secure a guarantee from Davis to protect the state secession convention if reconvened. However the next day, Federal authorities under William S. Harney reached a cease-fire arrangement with Jackson and Price in the Price-Harney Truce. Reynolds, when he heard about the truce through the newspapers, was upset and feared that Price was reverting to Unionism. Unionists such as Frank Blair also opposed the truce, and President Lincoln authorized Blair to overrule the agreement and relieve Harney of command. Harney's successor, Nathaniel Lyon, accompanied by Frank Blair, met with Governor Jackson and Price on June 11. Lyon demanded that the state government cooperate in suppressing the Southern rebellion, and that it permit federal military activities beyond the city limits of St. Louis.Castel p.30-32 Jackson and Price would only agree to preserve order in the state and resist any Confederate incursions into the state as long as Lyon agreed to disband loyal Home Guards organizations (including the 1st-5th U.S. Reserve Corps) and restrict Federal troops to metropolitan St. Louis. No agreement was reached. Jackson and Price left immediately for the state capital and the next day Jackson issued a proclamation describing the meeting and calling for fifty thousand volunteers to defend the state. Lyon‚Äôs reaction was to move immediately against the forces of Governor Jackson. On June 3, Reynolds had sent a letter to President Davis requesting that a Confederate army be sent to occupy Missouri, and on June 21 Reynolds and Edward C. Cabell, a representative sent separately by Governor Jackson, met with Davis in Richmond. Davis had his own concerns about the loyalty of Price and Jackson after the truce with Harney and their apparent willingness, based on the June 12 proclamation to resist the Confederacy. Davis declined to send troops until Missouri had actually seceded. According to Reynolds, Davis stated: > I think General Lyon acted very unwisely in not accepting Governor Jackson‚Äôs > proposals, and Mr. Lincoln may send him orders to accept them. Governor > Jackson in his proclamation makes a merit of having proposed them; now if I > agree to send Confederate troops into Missouri at your request, can you give > me any guarantee that Mr. Lincoln may not propose and Governor Jackson > assent to the agreement rejected by General Lyon, and compel those troops to > retire before their joint forces? Davis did, however, authorize Benjamin McCulloch to provide any necessary military assistance to Missouri consistent with protecting Arkansas and the Indian Territory. Lyon occupied the state capital in Jefferson City, Missouri in July 1861. The state constitutional convention was reconvened without the presence of pro-Southern representatives, and they declared the offices of Missouri governor and lieutenant governor vacant. Hamilton R. Gamble was appointed provisional governor, and Willard P. Hall was named lieutenant governor. Jackson and Reynolds, along with other pro-secession politicians such as David R. Atchison, maintaining they were still the elected government of the state, fled to the southwest corner of the state by Springfield, Missouri where Lyon was killed in the Battle of Wilson's Creek.Monaghan p. 158 Jackson and Reynolds convened the pro-South elected government in Neosho, Missouri and voted the Missouri secession to secede from the Union. Unable to defend themselves in the state, the government eventually moved to Marshall, Texas.  American Civil War  By December 1861 President Davis was trying to select an overall leader for Confederate forces in Missouri, Texas, and Arkansas. Jackson, Reynolds, and the Missouri Congressional delegation all lobbied for Sterling Price. Davis had concerns about Price based on his misunderstandings with McCulloch and his early support for neutrality. Davis was also unwilling to place in command of the area any general from the states of Missouri, Texas, or Arkansas--fearing that their objectivity for the entire Confederate war effort would be blinded by local concerns. After first offering the position to Henry Heth and Braxton Bragg, Mississippian Earl Van Dorn was eventually selected. The issue of local versus national control of Missouri troops did materialize after the Battle of Pea Ridge when Price‚Äôs troops, over the troops' and Price‚Äôs objections, were ordered across the Mississippi ‚Äì Price would eventually return to fight for Missouri but his troops would not.Castel p.66-83 Reynolds returned to Richmond to work with its Congressional delegation but eventually became frustrated with his inability to contribute. In April 1862 he returned to his family estate in Winnsborough, South Carolina. His active role in the war resumed and took on new importance, however, when he learned in December 1862 that Governor Jackson had died and that he was now governor. After the Battle of Corinth, Price had been strongly lobbying the Richmond government to return to Missouri with his troops. In late January 1863 Price went to Richmond to make his case, and Reynolds joined him there in his first act as governor. Both Price and Reynolds were concerned that with Missouri totally occupied by the Union any peace treaty might exclude Missouri from the Confederacy. Meeting with Davis and secretary of War James Seddon, the Missourians received the immediate assignment of Price west of the Mississippi with his troops to follow when circumstances warranted. Reynolds also received a letter designating him as an unofficial advisor to Generals Kirby Smith and Theophilus H. Holmes and an agreement from Davis to consult Reynolds before the appointment of any general officers.Castel p. 133-137 From this point on, despite an outwardly cordial appearance, the relationship between Reynolds and Price would deteriorate. In September 1863 forces under Price abandoned Little Rock, Arkansas, and Reynolds noted that \\"General Holmes and all the general officers under Price at Little Rock, except General Frost, considered the evacuation a blunder, and that Steele could have been beaten back with great disaster to him.\\".Castel p. 159 He did support and encourage the replacement of Holmes but he lobbied with the President to replace him with Simon B. Buckner rather than Price whom he considered (in Castel‚Äôs words) \\"devious, insincere, petulant, and arrogant\\" and \\"impulsive, tactless, and prone to indiscreet and exaggerated language.\\"Castel p. 166 Reynolds tried to exert his influence, backed up by his personal relationship with Jefferson Davis, over the civil and military decisions in the Trans-Mississippi Department. He brought some order to the records of the government which he had inherited from Governor Jackson but early on had differences with Price over the disbursement of the dwindling state treasury. The split became open and public when Reynolds appointed Colonel L. M. Lewis to the Confederate Senate to replace Price favorite and Davis critic, incumbent John B. Clark.Castel p. 159-170 As long as Missouri remained in Union hands, Reynolds remained a governor without an actual state to govern. Reynolds' final chance to become governor in fact occurred in October 1864 when he accompanied General Price in his raid back into Missouri. While both Price and Kirby Smith in their official reports painted a positive picture of the raid‚Äôs accomplishments (i.e. new recruits, railroads and bridges destroyed, prisoners taken, war materials gather), Castel notes: > Finally, neither Kirby Smith nor Price mentioned that the expedition failed > to seize St. Louis or occupy Jefferson City and install a Confederate > government, failed to bring about a mass uprising of Southern sympathizers, > failed to influence state elections except probably to increase the > Republican vote, and failed to do any damage to the Union military > installations in Kansas. In fact Price failed to achieve a single one of his > objectives other than obtain recruits, and he did that only in the imperfect > fashion described.Castel p.251-252 Similarly Prushankin p. 204 notes \\"But > the raid had not been a success and [Kirby] Smith knew it. Upon Price‚Äôs > return to Shreveport, Smith refused to receive him. Reynolds was proud of his own participation in the raid, claiming he had \\"been among the bullets on the battlefield, shared mule meat with the starving, and walked in the retreat\\".Castel p.256 At the same time he blamed Price for the raid‚Äôs failures which he characterized as nothing but \\"a weak and disgraceful plundering raid.\\" He was especially incensed at the failure to capture Jefferson City which would have allowed Reynolds to be officially installed as the state‚Äôs governor. Reynolds complained to Smith in October and in a December 23, 1864, published letter to the Marshall Texas Republican newspaper he thoroughly lambasted Price in the guise of defending two other officers that Reynolds claimed Price was using as scapegoats for his own failures. Reynolds followed this up by sending a copy to Price and asking him to resign from the military. Price responded by requesting that Smith conduct a formal investigation of Price‚Äôs charges and in a published letter to the Shreveport News denied Reynolds‚Äô charges while referring to him as someone \\"who pretends to be, and styles himself in it [the Texas Republican letter], the Governor of the State of Missouri.Castel p.257-261 A court of inquiry was held in late April 1865, but it was never concluded due to the end of the war. For the most part, Castel concludes that Reynolds‚Äô specific charges were not supportable and notes that Reynolds in 1887 effectively recanted the most serious charges. Referring to his public charges, Reynolds wrote, \\"It is against all the canons of history that, made in a heated controversy, they should be used, or even referred to, in stating ‚Äò‚Äôfacts‚Äô‚Äô of that campaign itself.\\"  Later life  Reynolds and a group of refugees including Kirby Smith, Sterling Price, John B. Magruder, and Joseph Shelby, with several hundred of his troops, retreated to Mexico in the summer of 1865. Reynolds took up residence in Mexico City where he served as a railroad commissioner and unofficial adviser to the Emperor Maximilian.Castel p. 273-274  Death  Reynolds killed himself in 1887 by jumping down an elevator shaft at the Customs House in St. Louis. A note with his body indicated he was afraid that he was losing his mental capacity.Castel p. 278-279 He is buried at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis.

The word may be rendered as \\"battalion\\", but Abels and Bachrach et al. say this is not accurate because the bataille was a completely ad hoc formation. In late medieval warfare, field armies were often drawn up into three main battles, also called guards: the vanguard (avant-garde), the middle guard, and the rearguard (arri√®re-garde), often abbreviated to simply the van, middle, and rear. These terms imply, correctly, that the van preceded the middle, which in turn preceded the rear, into battle if the battles were arranged sequentially as a column. If arranged abreast, the van was on the right and the rear the left.

Sokolow‚Äôs work uses both image and text to conjure connections among historical events, celebrities, politicians, and her own personal history in order to spur new consideration of alternate possible realities. Her work has been exhibited widely and is part of a number of permanent collections, including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art, the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Spertus Museum. Biography Deb Sokolow was born in 1974. She moved from Davis, CA to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana / Champaign, where she earned a BFA in 1996. She attended the school of the Art Institute, receiving her MFA in 2004. She is associate professor of instruction, art theory and practice at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, where she has worked since 2007.  Artwork  Sokolow has described her work as ‚ÄúText-driven narrative drawings‚Äù. She has shown works large enough to take up the gallery wall, as well as smaller drawings on notebook-size paper, as well as editions of hand-made and limited-run books. Her work includes drawings resembling floor plans, architectural renderings, as well as portraiture. Sokolow creates semi-fictitious narratives with drawing, collage and text which incorporate elements of history, politics, humor and the nefarious. Her large-scale installations, works on paper and panel, and artist books feature a nameless, paranoid narrator who uncovers sinister plots. Each piece includes writing which often present real people or real world scenarios, adding comical, fictional elements in order to invite the viewer to re-examine their own beliefs on a topic. Her work has covered many topics, including prominent or powerful men such as illusionist David Copperfield, drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Vladimir Putin, Frank Lloyd Wright, artist Willem De Kooning, and cult leader Jim Jones. She has used personal history as the starting point of compositions, as in the 2010 artist book, ‚ÄúBriefcase Exchange, Men‚Äôs Bathroom, McDonalds, Washington, D.C., 1986.‚Äù Sokolow populated a large 2010 piece called, ‚ÄúYou tell people you're working really hard on things these days‚Äù with an imagined set of characters based on the real-life occupants of Sokolow‚Äôs studio as well as the sculptor Richard Serra. Richard Serra had also appeared in a 2009 piece entitled, ‚ÄúDear Trusted Associate,‚Äù in which Sokolow portrays a paranoid alternate reality in which the noted sculptor engages in criminal activity. She often works with three distinct voices, which all interact and disagree with each other. In 2003, during graduate school at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, she had what she describes as an ‚Äúart crisis,‚Äù when she ‚Äúrealized I didn‚Äôt know what the heck I was doing or wanted to do as an artist. I had no personal investment in anything going on in the studio, so I stopped making work.‚Äù She returned home, and spent time watching movies, notably Rocky (1976). In order to have work ready for an upcoming show, she created the piece ‚ÄúRocky and Adrian (and Me).‚Äù The piece uses the tropes of a flowchart to analyze the love story between Stallone‚Äôs character, the small-time thug and boxer Rocky Balboa, and Adrian Pennino, a shy pet shop clerk portrayed by Talia Shire. In addition to charting the relationship depicted in the film, Sokolow inserted references to herself in relation to Rocky. In a discussion about this piece, an art history professor commented that looking at her work was ‚Äúlike doing homework.‚Äù She has been expanding on this mode of making art ever since. Someone Tell Mayor Daley, the Pirates are Coming is a single sheet of blue paper which maps out the narrator's suspicions that pirates have infiltrated your Chicago office. The narration is second person, and you suspect something is wrong when all of your co-workers are wearing bandannas and chunky gold earrings. As you delve further into the plot, you realize that the pirates are after Mayor Richard M. Daley's treasure buried at the former site of Meigs Field. Her work has been written about in The New York Times, Artforum.com, Art in Print, and she is included in VITAMIN D2, a hardcover survey of contemporary drawing practices published by Phaidon. Podcast interviews include Tyler Green's Modern Art Notes Podcast and Bad at Sports.

The Flock did not achieve the commercial success of other Columbia jazz-rock groups of the era such as Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears, but were recognized for featuring a violin prominently in their recordings. The violinist, Jerry Goodman, went on to become a member of Mahavishnu Orchestra and a solo artist. History The Flock had three early singles on Destination Records and one on USA Records, local Chicago labels, recorded between 1966 and 1968. Goodman, the violinist, was not in this line-up but worked as a roadie with the band. All four singles, \\"Can't You See\\", \\"Are You The Kind\\", \\"Take Me Back\\" and \\"What Would You Do If The Sun Died?\\" are available on CD. The members at the time of their 1969 album recording were Fred Glickstein (guitar, lead vocals), Jerry Goodman (violin), Jerry Smith (bass), Ron Karpman (drums), Rick Canoff (saxophone), Tom (T.S. Henry) Webb (saxophone) and Frank Posa (trumpet). The promising first album was further into jazz fusion than either Chicago or Blood Sweat & Tears, influenced by the Miles Davis' Bitches Brew album in which Webb participated, but whose performance was not recorded. The first album was produced by John McClure, better known for his work with classical and jazz artistsSleevenotes to CD 'Truth' (Esoteric Recordings ECLEC22606), with liner notes written from the audience at Whiskey A Go Go by blues legend John Mayall, on July 9, 1969. The band went back into the studio and recorded a second album entitled \\"Dinosaur Swamps\\" (With Jon Gerber replacing Tom Web) featuring the hit \\"Big Bird\\". They began work on a third studio album, provisionally titled 'Flock Rock', but rumours at the time had Columbia Records' Clive Davis raiding The Flock and recruiting Goodman for the Mahavishnu Orchestra project (Apparently jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty was guitarist-bandleader John McLaughlin's first choice, but the U.S. government denied Ponty a work-permit visa). Glickstein's remembrance of the event was, according to the sleevenotes with The Flock compilation CD 'Truth', slightly more prosaic. \\"In reality the band members started going in different musical directions. You know. That old song\\". The Flock reunited briefly in 1975 for an album Inside Out, and in 2004 a CD was released of a 1973 live concert called Live in Europe, which features Michael Zydowsky on violin in place of Goodman and includes original members Fred Glickstein, Jerry Smith, and Ron Karpman. In late 1976, Fred Glickstein and Ron Karpman recruited bassist/cellist Thom Blecka (formerly of T.S. Henry Webb Group featuring Frank Posa, Corky Siegel w/Sam Lay, Albert King, Johnny Ross, and The Babysitters) and formed a power trio called FLOCK 3. The new outfit played some older Flock compositions but emphasized new material co-written by Glickstein & Karpman, with some arrangements contributed by Blecka. The rock-oriented fusion trio played a few local gigs opening for Cheap Trick and The Cryan' Shames. They were occasionally joined onstage by Flock alumnus T.S. Henry Webb (sax/vocals) and also friends Dennis Tiger (blues harp/vocals) and Jeff Gates (keyboards). The band's live performances were never captured on tape and studio recording attempts fell by the wayside due to personnel conflicts. There is film footage of the big-band version of the Flock (the Dinosaur Swamps version of the group) playing the song \\"Big Bird (Fly)\\" on the 1971 Dutch documentary Stamping Ground. Goodman is prominently featured in the video among members of the group.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVgWxjJNYqQ Stamping Ground (The Flock appear at 1:00:58) Discography * The Flock (1969) * Dinosaur Swamps (1970) * Inside Out (1975) * Live in Europe (2004) * Flock Rock ‚Äì The Best of The Flock (2008) * 2131 South Michigan Ave (2009) * Heaven Bound: The Lost Album (recorded 1977) (2014) References External links *[ Allmusic] *Myspace.com *Saxophonist, Tom (T.S.

The Acts would have extend protection to \\"the appearance as a whole of an article of apparel, including its ornamentation,\\" with \\"apparel\\" defined to include \\"men's, women's, or children's clothing, including undergarments, outerwear, gloves, footwear, and headgear;\\" \\"handbags, purses, and tote bags;\\" belts, and eyeglass frames. In order to receive the three-year term of protection, the designer would be required to register with the U.S. Copyright Office within three months of going public with the design. H.R. 2511, 112th Congress H.R. 2511 was introduced July 13, 2011 by Representative Robert Goodlatte [R-VA6] with thirteen co-sponsors. On August 25, 2011, the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary referred the Bill to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-2511 H.R. 2033, 110th Congress H.R. 2033 was introduced April 25, 2007 by Representative Bill Delahunt with fourteen co-sponsors. On May 4, 2007 the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary referred the Bill to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. A hearing was held February 14, 2008, but the bill never made it out of the subcommittee. S. 1957, 110th Congress S. 1957 was introduced on August 2, 2007, in Washington, D.C. by Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) with ten co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary but progressed no further. H.R. 2196, 111th Congress H.R. 2196 was introduced on April 30, 2009, by Representative Delahunt and twenty-three co-sponsors. The bill was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary on the same day and then stalled in committee. Current Status of Fashion Design Protection Currently, fashion may only be protected by copyright to the extent that its shape is non-utilitarian enough to qualify as a creative \\"sculpture,\\" or to the extent that a design, pattern, or image on the clothing qualifies as \\"pictorial\\" or \\"graphic.\\" While current laws against counterfeit goods do provide some protection for designers, this is so only when the trademark is used and not when merely the design is copied under a different label. In addition, fashion may be protected by design patents if the requirements for patentability are met. To be patentable an ornamental design must be new, original and non-obvious. The United States Patent and Trademark Office website (www.uspto.gov) has a searchable database of patents, and includes patents on apparel in class D2, carrying articles in class D3, and eyeglass frames in class D16. Technological advances to the means of textile and garment production, as well as increases in the number of distribution channels and the availability of cheap labor in emerging economies have enabled those who would copy these designs to do so quickly and inexpensively. Legislation targeting design piracy has already been enacted in Europe, India, and Japan. Criticism Critics claim that, contrary to the bill's claims, the bill will actually harm independent fashion designers. The majority of independent designers do not have the litigation funds to effectively challenge big business should they be accused of copyright infringement. Furthermore, because distributors of accused designs can be penalized as well as the designer, distributors of clothing will become very wary of new designs unless the designer has adequate funds, influence, and power to hire skilled and effective lawyers. Pattern companies frequently utilize prevailing trends; so they too are vulnerable. Because of the legal risks of producing fashion patterns, fewer people will sew their own clothing, and fabric and sewing stores will suffer losses as well. As evidence of the bill's hypocrisy, critics point to how one of the most vocal supporters of the bill, Diane von F√ºrstenberg, was recently caught copying and distributing a piece of clothing originally designed by an independent Canadian designer. Critics also argue that the industry is already thriving commercially and encourages innovation. They point attention to the concept that originality in fashion design is too insubstantial for copyright law to distinguish protected elements from non-protected elements, and that extending copyright protection would stifle independent designers while giving powerful, big-business fashion houses a near-monopoly. Related Bills H.R. 5055, 109th Congress: To Amend Title 17, United States Code, to Provide Protection for Fashion Design H.R. 5055 was introduced March 30, 2006 by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte (R-Va.), with six co-sponsors from both parties. The bill was referred by the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. The subcommittee held a hearing on the bill on July 27, 2006, at which there was disagreement among legal experts as well as representatives of the fashion industry as to whether there was a need for copyright protection. Proponents of the Act claimed that new technology threatened American designers' ability to compete with the products of lower-cost countries, because the distribution of images of new designs and the automation of copying and manufacturing could occur within hours. They additionally pointed out that the United States was the exception among western nations in failing to protect designs. S. 3728, 111th Congress: Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act S.3728 was introduced on August 5, 2010, by Senator Chuck Schumer with ten co- sponsors. On December 1, 2010, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted unanimously for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor. This is the furthest that any of the design bills has progressed since 2006. Under the IDPPPA, a copy of a design would have infringed if it was found to be \\"substantially identical\\" to the original work with little to no changes to set that design apart. Penalties for false representation would have been increased from $500 to $5,000 and from $1,000 to $10,000. \\"Apparel\\" items that would be protected by this Act include women's, men's, and children's clothing as well as luggage, handbags, wallets and eyeglass frames. A \\"fashion design\\" under the IDPPPA would be defined as an entire article of apparel including its embellishment and also includes elements of the original apparel that are the creative work of the original designer and are unique. Supporters argue that this act would create more protection for fashion designers. Opponents have argued that the bill would \\"bring more lawyers into every step of the design process,\\" outlaw \\"inspiration and creativity,\\" prevent \\"unrestricted use of works in the public domain,\\" and \\"slow down the fast-paced design process.\\" Some designers have supported the IDPPPA for protecting their current and future fashion designs. For example, Kurt Courtney of the AAFA has praised the bill as a \\"great compromise and a product of hard work,\\" but added that its effects will largely be seen in court cases involving the bill.[BNA's Patent, Trademark & Copyright Journal, December 3, 2010.] S. 3523, 112th Congress: Innovative Design Protection Act S.3523 was introduced on September 10, 2012, by Senator Chuck Schumer with ten co-sponsors. On September 20, 2012, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary voted for the bill to proceed to the Senate floor without amendment. \\"Bill Summary & Status, 112th Congress (2011-12), S. 3523\\", THOMAS.

He purchased Halifax properties, which included the over-extended poor, likely the source of the comment that he was a \\"Litigious troublesome Man‚Ä¶ who has treated us in a Barbarous cruel manner.\\" In 1754 Salter expanded his operations into the field of government contracts. He was subsequently called upon to provide certain mercantile evaluations for the government. Salter was an early member of the grand jury in Halifax and served as a captain of militia (1761‚Äì1762) and an Overseer of the Poor (1765‚Äì1766). In 1757, he became a leader in the committee of Halifax freeholders which used legal effort to force Governor Charles Lawrence to convene a representative assembly in October 1758, Salter was amongst its 20 members. For 15 years Salter sat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, representing Halifax Township from 1759 to 1765 and Yarmouth Township from 1766 to 1772. During the Seven Years‚Äô War Salter was owner, with other Halifax entrepreneurs, of the privateer ship Lawrence. With his development of a sugar-house at Halifax in the mid-1760s. This and his American trade connections enabled him to capitalize upon the embargos placed on British goods by the Thirteen Colonies in the late 1760s. Despite his various interests, and further government contracts during the administration of Michael Francklin his fortunes continued to follow the decline of the Nova Scotia economy. In 1768 shipping and other losses were too much and after two years settling his debts in Nova Scotia and New England, he operated his sugar-house himself. In 1773 he built a vessel at Liverpool, Nova Scotia to return to the sea, as a trader, where he had begun - as a youth. American Revolution Malachy's son Montagu Wilmot Salter Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) Salter was tried and convicted for uttering seditions words in February 1777. In November 1777, he was also charged with the serious misdemeanour of treasonable correspondence. Because of poor health, his trial was postponed and hung over him for the last three years of his life. Barry Cahill, \\"The Treason of the Merchants: Dissent and Repression in Halifax in the Era of the American Revolution\\", Acadiensis, Vol. 26, 1 (Autumn 1996), p. 53 Later the same year his brig Rising Sun was captured by Salem privateers as prize. When prisoner in New England, he obtained a pass from the Massachusetts government to settle his family there. On his return to Halifax later that year, he saw continued court proceedings against him. Salter has been ranked by historians among the most important entrepreneurs of early Halifax, yet he failed to establish himself securely within its profitable network. The large house he constructed at the corner of Hollis and Salter streets, about 1760 was eventually purchased by William Lawson and, later demolished to become part of the site of Maritime Place, in downtown Halifax.  Family  He was born at Boston, second son of Malachy Salter and Sarah Holmes. He married Susanna Mulberry, on 26 July 1744 in Boston, and they had at least 11 children. He died at Halifax, Nova Scotia and is buried in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) (His son Malachi Salter (d.1752) has the oldest grave marker in the burying ground).

It is the centerpiece of a former monastery complex of the Canons Regular of the Lateran. Its interior has masterful compositions of some 2,000 stucco figures by Giovanni Pietro Perti and ornamentation by Giovanni Maria Galli and is unique in Europe.Paknys (2011‚Äì2013) The church is considered a masterpiece of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Baroque. It was funded by Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, commemorating a victory over the Muscovites and their expulsion from Vilnius after six years of occupation. History The foundation of the first church in this location is unknown. While digging the foundations for the present-day church, workers found a sculpture of an unknown knight. That inspired a legend that the first wooden church was founded by Petras Go≈°tautas, a legendary ancestor of the Go≈°tautai family, well before the official conversion of Lithuania to Christianity by Jogaila in 1387. More likely, the church was founded by Wojciech Tabor, Bishop of Vilnius (1492‚Äì1507). The wooden church burned down in 1594 but was rebuilt in 1609‚Äì16. In 1625, Bishop Eustachy Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz invited Canons Regular of the Lateran. Their new monastery was officially opened in November 1638. Bishop of Samogitia Jerzy Tyszkiewicz gifted a painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy () to the church and the monastery. The painting was brought by Tyszkiewicz from Faenza, Italy around 1641‚Äì47, and depicts Our Lady of Graces, patron of Faenza. Even though it was not canonically crowned, it was covered in silver riza and attracted votive offerings. This painting of the church's founder, Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, hangs in the apse. During the wars with Russia in 1655‚Äì61, the monastery was burned down and the church was destroyed. The construction of the new church was commissioned by the Great Lithuanian Hetman and Voivode of Vilnius Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac. It is said that Pac was inspired to rebuild the church after a 1662 incident when he hid in its ruins and thus narrowly escaped death from mutinous soldiers who later killed Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski, Field Hetman of Lithuania, and Kazimierz ≈ªeromski.Kviklys (1985), p. 317 Before this project, Pac, having made only a couple relatively minor donations to Bernardines in Vilnius and Jesuits in Druskininkai, was not known as a patron of the church or the arts.Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 28 Pac, who never married, envisioned that the church would become a mausoleum for the Pac family. The construction works started on 29 June 1668 (the day of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul) under the supervision of Jan Zaor from Krak√≥w and finished in 1676 by Giovanni Battista Frediani. Pac brought Italian masters Giovanni Pietro Perti and Giovanni Maria Galli for interior decoration. The works were interrupted by the founder's death in 1682. According to his last wishes, Pac was buried beneath the doorstep of the main entrance with the Latin inscription Hic Jacet Pecator (here lies a sinner) on his tombstone. At the end of the 18th century, lightning hit the church, knocked down a sculpture which fell and fractured the tombstone; the incident inspired many rumors about Pac and his sins.ƒåaplinskas (2010), p. 188 The tombstone is now displayed on the right wall of the main entrance. The church was finished by Pac's brother, Bishop of Samogitia Kazimierz Pac,Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 30 and was consecrated in 1701, while the final decoration works were completed only in 1704. The construction of the church revitalized Antakalnis and attracted other nobles: Sapiehas who built Sapieha Palace and S≈Çuszkos who built Slushko Palace. The interior of the church changed relatively little since that time. The major change was the loss of the main altar. The wooden altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766. The altar is now dominated by the Farewell of St. Peter and St. Paul, a large painting by Franciszek Smuglewicz, installed there in 1805. The interior was restored by Giovanni Beretti and Nicolae Piano from Milan in 1801‚Äì04. At the same time, a new pulpit imitating the ship of Saint Peter was installed. In 1864, as reprisal for the failed January Uprising, Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky closed the monastery and converted its buildings into military barracks. There were plans to turn the church into an Eastern Orthodox church, but they never materialized. In 1901‚Äì05, the interior was restored again. The church acquired the boat-shaped chandelier and the new pipe organ with two manuals and 23 organ stops. The dome was damaged during World War II bombings, but was rebuilt true to its original design. When in 1956 Vilnius Cathedral was converted into an art museum by Soviet authorities, the silver sarcophagus with sacred relics of Saint Casimir was moved to the St. Peter and St. Paul's Church.Kviklys (1985), p. 326 The sarcophagus was returned to its place in 1989. Despite religious persecutions in the Soviet Union, extensive interior restoration was carried out in 1976‚Äì87.Vitkauskienƒó (2005) Architecture Exterior thumb|upright|Floor plan: 1\\\\.

The main altar The church is located on a small hill near the Neris River and the former main road to Nemenƒçinƒó. It is part of a monastery complex that occupies approximately .Bielinis (1988), p. 77 The churchyard is surrounded by a thick high brick wall that has four small octagonal chapels.Kviklys (1985), p. 316 The churchyard used to have a small cemetery, but it was demolished in the 19th century. The church is a 17th- century basilica with a traditional cross floor plan and a dome with a lantern allowing extra light into its white interior. However, the dome is lowered and is visible only from a distance. The exterior was copied from the parish church of Tar≈Ç√≥w, built in 1645‚Äì55 and most likely designed by the same architect Jan Zaor.ƒåerbulƒónas (1994), p. 104 The facade is of heavy proportions. It is divided by a prominent balcony, freestanding columns (used for the first time in Lithuanian ecclesiastical architecture), windows, and cornices. The central facade is framed by two bell towers that are circular at the bottom and octagonal at the top. Two brass bells, in height, survive from 1668.Bielinis (1988), pp. 86‚Äì87 The double broken pediment has a relief of Mary standing on a cannon, flags, and other military attributes. Below the relief, Latin inscription reads REGINA PACIS FUNDA NOS IN PACE (Queen of Peace, protect us in peace) and reflects the intentions of the founder Pac and is a word play on his last name. Further below is the main portal. Surrounded by two puttos holding papal tiara (symbol of Saint Peter) and a sword (symbol of Saint Paul), there is a large cartouche with Pac's coat of arms Gosdawa. Two terracotta sculptures depicting Saint Augustine (patron saint of Canons Regular of the Lateran) and Stanis≈Çaw Kazimierczyk (Polish member of Canons Regular) were created in 1674. They measure in height.Bielinis (1988), p. 80 There were many more sculptures on the front and back of the church, but they did not survive.Bielinis (1988), p. 84 The facade was also decorated with a painting depicting Virgin of Mercy protecting people from the plague of 1710 in Vilnius. Imagery of Mary holding broken arrows of god's wrath was borrowed from the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy that hangs inside the church. Created in 1761, it was restored at least five times and lost its original features. After the last restoration in 2000, it was moved inside the church. Interior: decor and central nave Central nave looking south-west towards the entrance St. Peter and St. Paul's is one of the most studied churches in Lithuania. Its interior has over 2,000 different decor elements that creates a stunning atmosphere. The main author of the decor plan is not known. It could be the founder Pac, monks of the Lateran, or Italian artists. No documents survive to explain the ideas behind the decorations, therefore various art historians attempted to find one central theme: Pac's life and Polish‚ÄìLithuanian relations, teachings of Saint Augustine, Baroque theater, etc.Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 27 Art historian Birutƒó R≈´ta Vitkauskienƒó identified several main themes of the decor: structure of the Church as proclaimed at the Council of Trent with Saint Peter as the founding rock, early Christian martyrs representing Pac's interest in knighthood and ladyship, themes relevant to the Canons Regular of the Lateran, and themes inherited from previous churches (painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and altar of Five Wounds of Christ).Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 34 The decor combines a great variety of symbols, from local (patron of Vilnius Saint Christopher) to Italian saints (Fidelis of Como),Samuolienƒó (2001), p. 35 from specific saints to allegories of virtues. There are many decorative elements ‚Äì floral (acanthus, sunflowers, rues, fruits), various objects (military weapons, household tools, liturgical implements, shells, ribbons), figures (puttos, angels, soldiers), fantastical creatures (demons, dragons, centaurs), Pac's coat of arms, masks making various expressions ‚Äì but they are individualized, rarely repeating.Bielinis (1988), pp. 82‚Äì83 The architects and sculptors borrowed ideas from other churches in Poland (Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak√≥w, Sigismund's Chapel of Wawel Cathedral) and Italy (St. Peter's Basilica, Church of the Ges√π). The main entrance is flanked by two large sculptures of Saint Christopher carrying baby Jesus and a skeleton (grim reaper with a cloak and a large scythe) standing on crowns and other symbols of power. Saint Christopher is a protector, but death is still awaits everyone equally and Christians should prepare for it. The vestibule also has a scene of Last Judgment with various monsters and demons. The left side of the vestibule has a small room used as baptistery, while the right has a room for wakes. The latter has a scene of Pilate's court that thematically starts the Stations of the Cross. The colorful stations hang in the central nave and lead to the Altar of the Five Wounds of Christ. The central nave is decorated with evenly spaced sculptures of the twelve apostles. It also has a number of torture scenes from the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. These martyrs include Saint Sebastian, knights Saint George and Martin of Tours, Saint Maurice and the Theban Legion, Fidelis of Como and Victor Maurus. However, they are not immediately visible as they are placed in niches. Therefore, the nave is dominated by plain white walls that contrast with the opulent decorations elsewhere. From the central nave, the entrance to each of the four chapels has two allegorical female figures, representing eight Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount and created according to the iconography of Cesare Ripa. Their placement above the entrance arch is very similar to the Basilica of Santa Maria del Popolo.Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 33 However, they are not depicted in order but rearranged so that they would better reflect the themes of the chapels.Samuolienƒó (2001), p. 39 Interior: chapels and side altars Central nave looking north-east towards the altar The church has one central nave. Similar to the Church of the Ges√π in Rome, the narrow side aisles are turned into interconnecting chapels.ƒåerbulƒónas (1994), p. 103 There are four chapels: Women's or Queens', Saint Augustine's, Saint Ursula's, and Soldiers' or Knights'. The Queens' chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Petronilla, traditionally identified as daughter of Saint Peter. The chapel has four figures representing women's virtues: piety, generosity, purity, and assiduousness. The figure of generosity presents a stark social contrast between a wealthy lady and a pauper.Bielinis (1988), p. 83 Some art historians attempted to associate these figures with Queens of Poland. Painting of Saint Monica, mother of Saint Augustine, hangs in the chapel. The ceiling has scenes of executions and torture of early Christian martyrs, including Saint Fausta and Saint Theodora. The Knights' chapel has four figures of soldiers who became early Christian martyrs, including Saint Martinian, who helped Saint Peter to escape prison, and Saint Florian. The chapel also has a scene of Saint Casimir miraculously helping Lithuanians in the Siege of Polotsk and Saint Wenceslaus fighting with his brother Boleslaus the Cruel. This chapel clearly reflects Pac's interests: he dedicated most of his life to military and thought of himself as a knight. The chapel of Saint Ursula has more figures of early martyrs (Saint Apollonia, Saint Barbara, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria) that emphasize purity. The chapel of Saint Augustine emphasizes his teachings on Holy Trinity as undivided unity. The transept has altars of two brotherhoods that were active in the church: Merciful Mother of God and Five Wounds of Christ. These brotherhoods existed before the current church was built and, therefore, the imagery is inherited from the previous church. The western (left) transept displays the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and two large Turkish war drums (timpano, in circumference)Bielinis (1988), p. 86 that were seized from the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn of 11 November 1673 and granted to the church by its founder Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac.Kviklys (1985), p. 325 The transept ceiling has stucco reliefs from the life of Mary (with Visitation at the center) and crucifixion of Jesus.Samuolienƒó (2001), pp. 38‚Äì39 The Rococo pulpit was installed in 1801‚Äì1804. Carved of wood in a shape of a boat, it is supported by two tritons from the bottom. It is decorated with gilded details, including reliefs of eagle, bull, lion, and angel which symbolize the Four Evangelists. Interior: main altar Main altar with Jesus of Antakalnis on the left A noticeable feature is the missing main altar, which is known only from a description found in the inventory from 1766. It was carved from dark wood, gilded, and served as the focal center of the otherwise white interior.Paknys (1998) The altar had two levels. The upper level had a miraculous painting of Saint Peter that was most likely brought from the previous church.Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 32 It was surrounded by sculptures of the twelve apostles representing the twelve tribes of Israel or the chosen people. The lower lever had a painting of Saint Paul surrounded by sculptures depicting twelve pagan nations representing the world or the converted people. This altar was moved to the Catholic church in Daugai in 1766 and only fragments survive to the present day. With the loss of the altar, imagery of Saint Paul diminished significantly within the church. The altar as such was not replaced. Instead, Kazimierz Jelski sculpted four prophets (Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Elijah) while Franciszek Smuglewicz painted the large central painting depicting the emotional final parting of Saint Peter and Paul. Four other paintings hang in the choir: another painting by Smuglewicz depicting Archangel Michael, painting of Saint Mary Magdalene of Pazzi, a formal portrait of founder Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, and a painting of crucified Jesus.Bielinis (1988), pp. 81‚Äì82 This painting depicts a solar eclipse symbolizing crucifixion darkness and is said to be Pac's favorite. Parts of Jesus (crown of thorns, four nails, and perizoma) are covered in metal. The apse has four sculptures that stand inside wall niches, including Saint Jacob, John the Baptist, and resurrected Christ.Samuolienƒó (2001), p. 38 The ceiling of the apse is decorated with three stucco reliefs depicting the conversion of Paul the Apostle, calling of Saint Peter, and handing over of the keys of Heaven and papal tiara to Peter by Christ. This scene emphasizes that Peter and subsequent popes derived their power directly from God and is a strong Counter-Reformation statement. Above them, there is a relief of the Holy Spirit represented as a dove. The ceiling of the choir has a relief of the dinner at Emmaus. Next to it, there is a Latin inscription that reads domus dei aedificata est supra firmam petram (your house is built on firm rock) which echoes with the inscription on the base of the dome. The left corner between the transept and the choir has a sculpture of Jesus known as Jesus of Antakalnis. The sculpture is life-sized (), made of hardwood, dressed in clothes of white silk and purple velvet, and has a wig of natural black hair. A copy of a statue displayed in the Basilica of Jesus de Medinaceli in Madrid, it is the most prominent example of Spanish Baroque in Lithuania. It depicts the scene of Ecce homo: flogged Christ with a crown of thorns facing an angry mob. The sculpture's hands and head were ordered by Jan Kazimierz Sapieha the Younger from Roman artists in 1700. They were attached to a locally made torso and can be rotated. According to an 1804 canonical visitation, there are sacred relics sealed inside the head of the sculpture. The sculpture was displayed in the main altar of the Trinitarian Church built by Sapieha until the church was converted into an Eastern Orthodox church in 1864.Raƒçi≈´naitƒó (2011‚Äì2013) At that time it was moved to its present-day location at St. Peter and St. Paul's. The opposite corner has a stucco sculpture of Saint Francis of Assisi made in the first half of the 20th century.Bielinis (1988), p. 85 Interior: dome and ceilings Ceiling The dome's pendentives depict the Four Evangelists. The inscription surrounding the base of the dome (Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo ecclesiam meam et portae inferi non praevale buntadversus eam: You are Peter (rock) and on that rock I shall build my church and gates of hell shall not prevail against it) is from the Confession of Peter and is the same as that of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican.Vai≈°vilaitƒó (2001), p. 31 Above it, there are sculptures of four Doctors of the Church: Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine (his sculpture can be seen from the entrance), Saint Ambrose, and Pope Gregory I. Still above them there are scores of angels. The composition culminates with God the Father in the center of the dome as if to say that God sees everything. This composition seems inverted since the Evangelists are below the Doctors, but that could be a purposeful statement to emphasize importance of the Church after the Council of Trent. A boat-shaped chandelier made of brass and glass beads hangs from the middle of the dome and reminds that Saint Peter was a fisherman. Made by craftsmen from LiepƒÅja and installed in 1905, it had eight seven-branch candle holders. The ceiling is decorated with five frescos that cover Bielinis (1988), p. 81 which are the second largest ceiling frescoes (after the Pa≈æaislis Monastery) in Lithuania.Paknys (2001), p. 43 The three smaller frescoes above the organ form a triptych from Saint Peter's life: healing a cripple, escape from prison, and vision of a sheet with animals. The other two frescoes depict Quo vadis? and Peter's confrontation with Simon Magus.Paknys (2001), pp. 44‚Äì45 These frescoes are of a rather simple composition,ƒåerbulƒónas (1994), p. 105 poorly executed, and lack background detail,Paknys (2001), p. 49 but the figures are expressive, making complex, dynamic, almost theatrical movements. The authorship of the frescoes is unknown. Vladas Drƒóma attributed them to Martino Altomonte, while Mieczys≈Çaw Skrudlik suggested Michelangelo Palloni.Paknys (2001), pp. 43‚Äì44 Mindaugas Paknys, using surviving written records, disproved both hypotheses and attributed the frescoes to Johann Gotthard Berchhoff.Paknys (2001), pp. 43‚Äì51Paliu≈°ytƒó (2005), p. 73 Two other frescoes by a different author decorate the sacristies. They depict Jesus saving Saint Peter from drowning and a vision of Stanis≈Çaw Kazimierczyk.

It was founded in 1898 by Charles DeKay, an art and literary critic of the New York Times to \\"stimulate, foster, and promote public interest in the arts and to educate the American people in the fine arts\\". Since 1906 the organization has occupied the Samuel J.

The National Arts Club is noted for allowing members access to a Gramercy Park key. The National Arts Club has several art galleries, and hosts a variety of public programs in all artistic areas including theater, literature and music. Although the club is private, many of its events are free and open to the public. The club's mansion headquarters was designated a New York City landmark in 1966,, p.86 and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976. It is located in the Gramercy Park Historic District. History A group of friends, all of them involved in architecture, art, or civic affairs, discussed the possibility of a new kind of club that would embrace all the arts. The establishment of the Club came at a time when American artists were increasingly turning to their own nation rather than exclusively to Europe as a center of work and creativity. Significantly, the Club would offer full membership for women at the onset, reflecting their accomplishment in the arts.The west parlor of The National Arts Club.While the group was working out an organizational plan, Charles DeKay, the literary and art critic of the New York Times for 18 years, returned from a diplomatic post abroad. An inspired organizer and entrepreneur, he sent letters to men and women of importance in the New York area as well as in metropolitan areas across the country. The response was so enthusiastic that the Club was able to apply to Albany for its charter in 1898. With the application went a list of the officers, Board of Trustees, and members totaling more than 1200. The list included such collectors as Henry Frick, William T. Evans, Benjamin Altman, Jules Bache and Henry Walters. Though not a charter member, J. Pierpont Morgan joined the Club early in its development and later was made an Honorary Vice President. Among the artists of the period, earlier charter members, or those joined in the early days of the Club were Frederic Remington, William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri and George Bellows. The Club's first home was a brownstone on West 34th Street. Commerce, meanwhile, was moving up from downtown, and the neighborhood of brownstones was changing. Spencer Trask, its treasurer, was asked to find the Club a new home. He found that 14 and 15 Gramercy Park South, the former home of Samuel Tilden, was on the market. Legend has it that he was so afraid that some other buyer would also find it that he put down some money of his own to bind the bargain. In 1906, the Club acquired the Samuel J. Tilden House.

Controversy The president of the club from 1985 to 2011 was O. Aldon James, Jr. James was credited with revitalizing the organization and doubling the membership. In the same period, however, there was a conviction for fraudulent use of the club's nonprofit tax identity by James's twin brother John, and another conviction for the theft of tax receipts by the club's dining room manager, as well as a high-profile conflict with Gramercy Park trustees over the cutting of trees that the club sought to save. In September 2012, an 18-month investigation into the final five years of James' presidency by New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman resulted in a $2 million lawsuit against James by the state, charging that he misused the club's funds and real estate for his own benefit. The state charges that James used his control of the club to take over numerous real estate units under its auspices, and that he and his twin brother hoarded clothes, antiques and other valuable artifacts until their rooms could no longer be lived in. According to the state, since 2006, James' activities cost the club $1.5 million in lost rentals, as well as a quarter of a million dollars the club provided for James' opulent lifestyle. James also fraudulently used money from a fellowship fund to pay for repairs to the club's facade. In July 2013, the state Attorney General's office and James reached a settlement with the former president agreeing to pay the club $900,000. The state's investigation also resulted in agreements with the club for reforms, such as term limits on officers and board members, as well as changes in some of its real estate practices.Leland, John. \\"Attorney General Sues Club‚Äôs Ex-Leader for $2 Million, Citing Misuse of Its Money\\" New York Times (September 21, 2012) References  External links   National Arts Club records at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:Culture of New York City Category:Gentlemen's clubs in the United States Category:Gramercy Park Category:Organizations based in Manhattan Category:Arts organizations established in 1898 Category:1898 establishments in New York (state) Category:Clubs and societies in New York (state) ","title":"National Arts Club"},{"id":"7179370","text":"Michael T.

It lies along FM 922 along Clear Creek, midway between Forestburg in Montague County and Era in Cooke County. In 2000, Rosston reported a population of 110. The community boasts a general store, a volunteer fire department, two church buildings, and several residences, as well as a wealth of agricultural enterprises. Just east of the town, there is the Liberman Broadcasting Tower Era, one of earth's tallest structures, and as of May 2007 was the tallest structure in Texas.Antenna Structure Registration - Federal Communications Commission The tower is named for its proximity to Era, though it is much closer to Rosston and Leo.Texas' tallest structure brings emergency communication, Spanish radio to area - Gainesville Daily Register, 10 May 2007 History Anglo settlement began as early as the Texas Revolution in Cooke County, drawing many to establish homesteads and ranches in the Rosston vicinity. In 1865, the area of present-day Rosston was settled. The scattered community was promptly raided by tribes from Indian Territory in what would become the last raid of Indians on white settlers in Cooke County. Settlers from Grayson County later established Rosstown in 1870. The namesake Ross family owned a general store, cotton gin, and mill to serve the farmers of the area. A post office opened in 1872 and the town officially became Rosston. The Butterfield Overland Mail route passed near Rosston, operating between Gainesville in Cooke County and Jacksboro in Jack County, Texas. Rosston, like many other small Texas towns, was bypassed by railway lines and slipped into relative obscurity in the 20th Century. But one local claim to fame is that notorious outlaw Sam Bass used Rosston as a hideout, and the town celebrates Sam Bass Day every year on the third Saturday in July.

He was the third husband of World War II heroine Odette Sansom (n√©e Brailly); they married in 1956. Biography Hallowes was born in Kensington, London, the son of Edward Price Hallowes, a partner in Twiss, Browning & Hallowes of London, importers of Dry Monopole champagne, and Aileen Macleod of Adelaide, South Australia. He was educated at the Aldro prep school, Eastbourne, the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz in Switzerland, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, but left without a degree. During the Second World War, Hallowes initially served with the 2nd Battalion, the Gordon Highlanders in the defence of Malaya against Japan in 1942. His unit was one of the last to escape into Singapore before the causeway to Malaya was destroyed. When Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942, Hallowes joined Major \\"Nick\\" Nicholson to form one of two pairs of officers who were sent to carry the order to ceasefire to garrisons on the islands of Pulau Blakang Mati and Pulau Brani. They were given permission to try to escape from the Japanese after the order was delivered. They took a boat to the east coast of Sumatra, and walked to Padang, from whence they were rescued by Royal Navy destroyer which called in to refuel after the Battle of the Java Sea. They were shipped to Ceylon, and then flown to India. Hallowes became a staff captain in Bombay in May 1942, but volunteered to join SOE. He joined a special forces training school in Haifa, and became a member of SOE's Force 133, in Cairo, earmarked for assignments in Yugoslavia. Before long, he was reassigned to Peterborough to join an SOE \\"Jedburgh\\" team. 94 of these three-member teams, with one British or American officer, one French officer and a radio operator, were parachuted into France after D-Day, to assist the French Resistance with sabotage. Hallowes led his team, code-named \\"Jeremy\\", with French Lieutenant Henri Charles Giese and radio operator Sergeant Roger Leney. He and his team travelled via Algiers to arrive in the south of France on 24 August 1944, where they were met by American SOE operative Virginia Hall. Hallowes and Giese travelled to Le Puy, the local Gaullist headquarters. He assisted the Free French forces by arranging a drop of arms, assisting them to liberate French villages, and encouraging them to prevent the Germans from withdrawing across the Rh√¥ne. He received a Croix de Guerre for his activities in France. Back in Britain in September 1944, Hallowes joined SOE's Special Planning Unit 22, to consider the feasibility of sending German-speaking SOE operatives (particularly Poles and former German prisoners of war) into German territory. He took charge of the prisoner of war elements, which gained useful intelligence of the Germans before the war ended, and of Soviet forces afterwards. He was mentioned in dispatches in 1945. Post-Second World War After the war, Hallowes returned to Britain and joined the family wine importing company. He was co-founding director of the International Distillers & Vintners in 1962, and the first chairman of the newly created IDV Europe in 1972. Death He retired from the board of IDV in 1983, and died in 2006, aged 88, and is buried with his wife at Burvale Cemetery, Hersham, Surrey. In March 2008 a cache of arms was discovered during a house-clearance in a property in Walton-on-Thames. The weapons ‚Äì an American M1 carbine, German MP 40 submachine gun, British .38 Enfield No. 2 revolver, and American .45 Ithaca M1911A1, .32 Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless and German 9 mm Navy Model Luger pistols ‚Äì were identified at the Imperial War Museum as belonging to Hallowes, before being donated to the Gordon Highlanders Museum in Aberdeen.

He batted and threw left-handed, stood tall and weighed . Baumann signed with the Red Sox in 1952 out of high school in his native St. Louis, receiving a $90,000 bonus from owner Tom Yawkey, who nicknamed him \\"Beau\\". He won 10 of 11 decisions for the Triple-A Louisville Colonels in 1953, his second season in professional baseball, before being drafted into United States Army service during the Korean War. When he mustered out of the Army in mid-1955, he joined the MLB Red Sox in late July. In his debut, he earned a victory with 5 innings of scoreless relief, as Boston defeated the Detroit Tigers, 3‚Äì2. But an arm injury incurred during his military service hampered his Red Sox tenure. He needed return trips to the minor leagues from 1956‚Äì58 before making the Red Sox roster for the full campaign. Then, that November, he was traded to the White Sox for first baseman Ron Jackson. In , as a member of the defending American League champions, he had a 13‚Äì6 mark for the White Sox, and led AL pitchers with a 2.67 ERA. In 47 games pitched, including 20 starts, he compiled seven complete games and two shutouts. He added four saves as a relief pitcher. But he followed in with a disappointing 10‚Äì13 record, led the AL in earned runs allowed, and his ERA ballooned by almost three full runs, to 5.61. His effectiveness largely returned in , but thereafter he made only one more start over his final two years with the ChiSox and in he again struggled on the mound. His ERA climbed to 6.19, and Baumann was traded to the cross-town Cubs during the off-season. He made four appearances out of the Cub bullpen in 1965, posted an ERA over 7.00, and was sent to Triple-A during the May roster cutdown from 28 to 25 men. His active career concluded after that season. In his 11-season MLB career, Baumann posted a 45‚Äì38 record with a 4.11 ERA and 14 saves in 244 games pitched. Of his 78 starting assignments, 19 were complete gates and four were shutouts. In 797 innings pitched, he allowed 856 hits and 300 base on balls, with 384 strikeouts.

It is a strategy game, involving one or more players either by hotseat, on LAN, modem, or even PBEM (play-by-email). The game is set starting in the year 1493, and deals with the discovery and conquest of the Americas. A deluxe version of the game was released in 1997. It was later released on GOG.com.http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/conquest_of_the_new_world Gameplay Players move their various units (including explorers, colonists, and soldiers) through a blacked-out world, uncovering mountains, plains, and rivers. Landmarks are named by the first player to discover them. After mapping out some of the local terrain, players must build a colony and make it self-sufficient; to this end, players can build sawmills, metal mines, housing, and farms to generate the resources and space necessary to expand, and eventually, build more colonies. Lastly, players must train armies with which to conquer the other colonists and eventually proclaim independence from their mother country. The player controls one of 6 different nations (five European and the High Natives) in their attempt to colonize and conquer a \\"new\\" continent. The game is turn-based, and combat is a mini-game taking place on a 3x4 square battlefield where victory can be achieved by killing all enemy troops or capturing the enemy's flag. The gameworld is represented in an isometric point of view with three-dimensional terrain features. Colonies consist of a Colony Centre, exerting an area of control within which all buildings must be placed. Most buildings, including the Colony Centre, can be upgraded, adding to their production capabilities. Resources are used for construction and trading. Victory conditions are customizable, so the game can be played as a pure conquest game with the last nation standing, being the winner, or as a more peaceful race for victory points to a pre-determined score. Reception A reviewer for Next Generation judged that while Conquest of the New World is not as enthralling or addictive as its competitors Civilization II or Sid Meier's Colonization, and is too lacking in flair and style to appeal to the casual player, it has a distinctive simplicity and a need for forethought which would make it enjoyable for hardcore strategy fans. He particularly complimented the ability for players to adjust the level of complexity by setting either the colonies or the military on automatic. In contradiction, Trent Ward of GameSpot argued that Conquest of the New World is much less dry than other historical simulations. He commented that the battles are tactically deep while refreshingly short, and that features such as the ability to name landmarks and networked multiplayer make the game generally outstanding. Scott Gehrs of Computer Game Review concluded, \\"For players that are into strategy games, Conquest of the New World should be one of the games on the shelf.\\" The game scored 3/5 in Computer Games Magazine, and 4/5 in Adrelinelane Vault. In 2000, Conquest of the New World passed 500,000 units in sales.https://web.archive.org/web/20050219000040/http://www.cdmag.com/articles/028/152/conquest.html References External links Conquest of the New World Central - a fan site Category:1996 video games Category:Age of Discovery video games Category:DOS games Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Interplay Entertainment games Category:Mac OS games Category:Play-by- email video games Category:Quicksilver Software games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Conquest of the New World"},{"id":"7179514","text":"Roy Davis Jr. is an American electronic musician from Chicago, Illinois, specialising in house music.

It was Killingg√§nget's follow-up to Nilecity 105,6. It was directed by Walter S√∂derlund and produced by Magdalena Jangard. The loose plot of the series revolves around a number of mostly unrelated storylines which are told in segments in each episode. These segments are flanked by various stand-alone sketches that sometimes elaborate on minor characters. Plot The primary storyline concerns Percy Nileg√•rd (Johan Rheborg), who has gone into psychotherapy, where he meets Dr J. Tull, which may not be his real name, and reveals how he took over another person's life to make money. Percy feels lonely and wants Dr. Tull to help him write his memoir. Their conversation then shifts to a series of flashbacks in which Percy relates the story of how he exploited the new boss of an old family-run brewery. Other storylines include: *Christer Fuglesang tries to become the first Swede in space but has to deal with his extremely eccentric teacher Captain Kl√§nning (Dress).

Grey was an English illustrator, best remembered for his illustration of Jane Turpin stories by Evadne Price. He was with the publishing house of Robert Hale, Ltd. and illustrated all ten collections of Jane stories published by Robert Hale. The 1985 collection of Jane stories - Jane and Co published by Macmillan also uses his illustrations. Frank R. Grey also produced a lot of work for British magazines of various profiles. His work was published extensively in the 1920s and 1930s, starting as early as 1914. Among the wide range of magazines for which he produced works were : Punch, Chums, The Scout, Boy's Own Paper, Windsor Magazine, Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, and The Dreadnought. His work was also published in several short story compilations and reference books. Grey was also a member of the Kathleen Boland Studio, an illustration agency presently known as Illustration. Jane stories were published by three publishing houses over time (John Hamilton, Newnes, and Robert Hale), and each publishing house employed their own illustrator, who portrayed Jane Turpin in different ways. Newnes employed the noted illustrator of William Brown books - Thomas Henry. However, the depiction of Jane Turpin by Grey is the most popular one, and the image of the angelic looking, golden haired girl with curls actually influenced Evadne Price's descriptions of Jane. Grey used watercolours for cover art and a hatch style of illustration on the Jane books.

Nieto was born in Venice. He first practised as a physician and officiated as a Jewish preacher at Livorno, Italy. There he wrote in Italian a work entitled \\"Paschologia\\" (Cologne, 1702), in which he dealt with the differences of calculation in the calendars of the Greek, Roman, and Jewish churches, and demonstrated the errors which had crept into the calendar from the First Council of Nicaea until 1692. In 1702 Nieto succeeded Solomon Ayllon as ecclesiastical chief of the Portuguese Jews in London; and two years after his settlement in that city he published his theological treatise, Della Divina Providencia, √≥ sea Naturalezza Universal, √≥ Natura Naturante (London, 1704). He explained that 'nature' was a modern word, and in reality referred to the action of God in governing natural phenomena. This work provoked opposition against him, including accusations of Spinozism (which in the atmosphere of the time meant pantheism or atheism), but some of the accusers were believed to be heretics motivated by their support for Shabbetai Zevi. Tzvi Ashkenazi, who was called in as arbitrator, decided in his favor (Hakham Tzvi, Responsa, No. 18). Not only was he exonerated, but he was highly praised for his teachings. Nieto was also highly praised by Rabbi Chaim Azulay (the 'Chida'). He died in London and is buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Mile End Road. Nieto was a powerful controversialist. In his Matteh Dan, or Kuzari Heleq Sheni (London, 1714), written in Hebrew and Spanish on the model of the Kuzari of Judah ha-Levi, he defended the Oral Torah against the Karaites, and showed that the disagreements in the Talmud lay not in essential laws but in minor matters. (Within the fictional framework of the book, his spokesman argues against the historic Karaite etc., even quoting from Karaite literature, but as there were few if any actual Karaites in Western Europe at the time of writing, the real attack was against Jewish dissidents such as Uriel Acosta.) He also waged war untiringly on the supporters of the Shabbethaian heresies, which he regarded as dangerous to the best interests of Judaism, and in this connection wrote his Esh Dat (London, 1715) against Hayyun (who supported Shabbetai Zevi). Nieto was one of the most accomplished Jews of his time and was equally distinguished as philosopher, physician, poet, mathematician, astronomer, and theologian. A prolific writer, his connection with Christian scholars was extensive, especially with Ungar, the bibliographer. Nieto was the first to fix the time for the beginning of Sabbath eve for the latitude of England.

Its mission began on 1 January 1997. The coalition partners of the United States, United Kingdom, and Turkey provided approximately 45 aircrafthttp://www.1stfighter.org/F15s/images_f15s/onw.jpg and more than 1,400 personnel to support Operation Northern Watch. The joint U.S. forces of some 1,100 U.S. personnel, included airmen, sailors, soldiers, and Marines, as well as aircraft from every arm of the United States Armed Forces. The original mandate from the Turkish government allowed the operation to continue for six months. Turkey subsequently approved two 6-month extensions, but indicated that it would not become a permanent mission. For the first year of the mission, northern Iraq was quiet, with no combat between Coalition aircraft and Iraqi forces. Operation Northern Watch forces did not take part in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. After Desert Fox, Iraq announced they would no longer recognize the no-fly zones and urged their troops to attack Coalition aircraft. On 28 December 1998 Iraq fired SA-3 surface to air missiles against coalition aircraft patrolling the northern no- fly zone. In response, U.S. Air Force (USAF) F-15Es, F-16CJs, and U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) EA-6Bs launched anti-radiation missiles and dropped precision guided munitions (PGMs) on the SA-3 ground-based missile site that fired on the ONW aircraft, and destroyed it.Transcript from 16 Nov 1999 briefing of Brig Gen David A. Deptula, commander ONW 1998, 1999 at the Aerospace Power Seminar series, Washington, D.C. From December 1998 to March 1999, U.S. aircraft over northern Iraq came under almost daily fire from Iraqi surface- to-air missile sites and anti-aircraft guns. U.S. aircraft responded by bombing Iraqi air-defense sites, using laser-guided bombs as well as AGM-88 HARM missiles and AGM-130 long range air-to-surface missiles.\\"Operation Northern Watch: 1999 Events\\". GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 22 February 2016. The first combat use of the AGM-130 was conducted during ONW. Coalition aircraft flew patrols on an average of 18 days per month, and were usually fired upon. The most common threat was from anti-aircraft guns. Despite Saddam Hussein offering a $14,000 reward for downing a Coalition aircraft, no warplanes were shot down.Operation Northern Watch Low level conflict continued up until the invasion of Iraq in 2003, although the number of response incidents declined dramatically after 1999. The final combat air patrol occurred on 17 March 2003 (from the Incirlik Air Base). Six weeks later the operation concluded with an official stand down on 1 May 2003. A grand total of 36,000 sorties were flown during Operation Northern Watch, and 40,000 personnel had been deployed at some point during the operation. Operation Northern Watch was the longest combat operation in the history of the European Command.

He led the organization from 1949 until 1959, and hosted the abortive Apalachin meeting in 1957. Barbara died on June 17, 1959. Early life Barbara was born on August 9, 1905, in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, to Giuseppe Barbara and Angela Galante. He immigrated to the United States in 1921, at the age of 16 and became a naturalized citizen in 1927. He was soon working as a hitman for the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family. During the 1930s, Barbara was arrested for several murders, including the 1933 murder of rival bootlegger Sam Wichner. Wichner had gone to Barbara's house for a business meeting, where Barbara allegedly strangled Wichner to death. However, law enforcement never obtained enough evidence to prosecute Barbara. It is also speculated that in 1940, Barbara murdered Pittston, Pennsylvania, mob boss John Sciandra in order to take over his criminal organization,The Pittston Family Dieland:Mob although newspaper articles say Sciandra died of natural causes in 1949. Barbara married Josephine Vivona on June 24, 1933, in Endicott, New York, and fathered two sons, Joseph Jr. and Peter, and two daughters, Angeline, who died at the age of two, and Angela. Country estate In 1944, Barbara bought a parcel of land in the rural town of Apalachin, New York, and built an estate on 625 McFall Road for a total of $250,000. Barbara soon involved himself in local business circles and philanthropy. When Barbara applied for a New York handgun permit, the police chief of Endicott, New York, served as a reference.\\"How America Met the Mob\\" American Heritage Magazine July‚ÄìAugust 2000 In 1946, Barbara was convicted of illegally purchasing 300,000 pounds of sugar (intended for the manufacture of bootleg alcohol). Soon after this, Barbara entered the soft drink distribution business, buying a Canada Dry bottling plant. Barbara eventually gained control of the beer and soft drink market in Binghamton, New York. In 1956, a conference between dozens of mobsters was held at Barbara's estate; Barbara also suffered a heart attack that year. The Apalachin meeting In 1957, after taking control of the Luciano crime family from boss Frank Costello, boss Vito Genovese wanted to legitimize his new power by holding a national Cosa Nostra meeting. Genovese elected Buffalo, New York boss and Commission member, Stefano \\"the Undertaker\\" Magaddino, who in turn chose northeastern Pennsylvania crime boss Joseph Barbara and his underboss Russell Bufalino to oversee all the arrangements. On November 14, 1957, Barbara's estate in Apalachin was used again to hold a large meeting‚Äîover 100 mafiosi from the United States, Italy and Cuba. Cuba was one of the Apalachin topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of La Cosa Nostra on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda. The New York garment industry interests and rackets, such as loansharking to the business owners and control of garment center trucking, were other important topics on the Apalachin agenda. A local state trooper named Edgar D. Croswell had been aware that Carmine Galante had been stopped by state troopers following a visit to Barbara's estate the previous year. A check of Galante by the troopers found that he was driving without a license and that he had an extensive criminal record in New York City. In the time preceding the November 1957 meeting, trooper Croswell had Barbara's house under occasional surveillance. He had become aware that Barbara's son was reserving rooms in local hotels along with the delivery of a large quantity of meat from a local butcher to the Barbara home. That made Croswell suspicious, and he therefore decided to keep an eye on Barbara's house. When the state police found many luxury cars parked at Barbara's home they began taking down license plate numbers. Having found that many of these cars were registered to known criminals, state police reinforcements came to the scene and began to set up a roadblock. Having barely started their meeting, Bartolo Guccia, a Castellammare del Golfo native and Barbara employee, spotted a police roadblock while leaving Barbara's estate. Guccia later said he was returning to the Barbara home to check on a fish order. Some attendees attempted to drive away but were stopped by the roadblock. Others trudged through the fields and woods ruining their expensive suits before they were caught. Many Mafiosi escaped through the woods surrounding the Barbara estate. Up to 50 men escaped, but over 60 were apprehended, including Commission members Genovese, Carlo Gambino, Joseph Profaci and Joseph Bonanno. Virtually all of them claimed they had heard Joseph Barbara was feeling ill and that they had visited him to wish him well. Aftermath of Apalachin Barbara found himself investigated by law enforcement and indicted for not testifying to a grand jury about what transpired at his home on November 14, 1957. In 1959, he was also charged with income tax evasion and submitting fraudulent corporation tax forms. On April 27, 1959, Barbara pleaded innocent to income tax charges before the Federal District Court in Syracuse, New York. Barbara's business interests declined, as he lost his lucrative bottling contract with Canada Dry. Barbara's health continued to deteriorate, suffering a heart attack on May 27, 1959, and another on June 17, 1959, at Wilson Memorial Hopital in Johnson City, New York, killing him. Following his death, Barbara's Apalachin estate was sold for $130,000, and, for a time, was used for sightseeing tours. Barbara is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Johnson City, New York. The Apalachin meeting put the media spotlight directly on the secretive Cosa Nostra, triggering both state and federal hearings. As a result, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover could no longer deny the existence of the Cosa Nostra in the United States.

The sole species in the genus is Gynerium sagittatum, a tall grass that grows up to six metres (twenty feet) high. It is a very vigorous species that grows into a considerably dense mass of vegetation. The species is known as \\"cana-do-rio\\", \\"cana-flecha\\", \\"cana-frecha\\", \\"ub√°\\" and \\"cana- brava\\" in Brazil, \\"ca√±a brava\\" in Peru and Colombia, \\"chuch√≠o\\" in eastern Bolivia, and \\"ta√±il\\" in Guatemala and other Spanish speaking countries. It is known in English as \\"wildcane\\" or \\"wild cane\\", while \\"arrow cane\\" is less common (sagitta is Latin for arrow).  Description  The stems are straight and erect, the lower part is covered with \\"vainas\\" from the fallen leaves, while in the middle part the leaves are arranged in fan shaped groups. The upper part, round and thin, stiff on the outside and soft on the inside, develops a large bloom at the top. There are many varieties in the plant's stems. The bark zone, which is the main factor in the unusual height, functions as a water distribution system, transporting water from the underground roots to the superior part of the plant including the leaves. This vital function occurs at any season of the year.  Ecology  Being one of the first plants to colonise open areas, G. sagittatum is an important pioneer species that reaches new sites via wind-distributed seeds. Once established, it spreads vegetatively, and is found usually near rivers and lakes, and even beaches.  Uses  * In Colombia its straw is used to create different accessories including the traditional sombrero vueltiao, symbol of Colombia. * In Brazil, the lower and middle parts are used in cheap or improvised fences, and in cheap trellises for climbing plants and cultivation of tomato. The upper part, with the bloom at the top, is sometimes used in decoration. The more homogeneous section of the upper part is used to make arrows and birds cages.

Truncated distributions arise in practical statistics in cases where the ability to record, or even to know about, occurrences is limited to values which lie above or below a given threshold or within a specified range. For example, if the dates of birth of children in a school are examined, these would typically be subject to truncation relative to those of all children in the area given that the school accepts only children in a given age range on a specific date. There would be no information about how many children in the locality had dates of birth before or after the school's cutoff dates if only a direct approach to the school were used to obtain information. Where sampling is such as to retain knowledge of items that fall outside the required range, without recording the actual values, this is known as censoring, as opposed to the truncation here.Dodge, Y. (2003) The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms. OUP. Definition The following discussion is in terms of a random variable having a continuous distribution although the same ideas apply to discrete distributions. Similarly, the discussion assumes that truncation is to a semi-open interval y ‚àà (a,b] but other possibilities can be handled straightforwardly. Suppose we have a random variable, X that is distributed according to some probability density function, f(x) , with cumulative distribution function F(x) both of which have infinite support. Suppose we wish to know the probability density of the random variable after restricting the support to be between two constants so that the support, y = (a,b] . That is to say, suppose we wish to know how X is distributed given a < X \\\\leq b . :f(x|a < X \\\\leq b) = \\\\frac{g(x)}{F(b)-F(a)} = \\\\frac{f(x) \\\\cdot I(\\\\\\\\{a < x \\\\leq b\\\\\\\\})}{F(b)-F(a)} \\\\propto_x f(x) \\\\cdot I(\\\\\\\\{a < x \\\\leq b\\\\\\\\}) where g(x) = f(x) for all a and g(x) = 0 everywhere else. That is, g(x) = f(x)\\\\cdot I(\\\\\\\\{a < x \\\\leq b\\\\\\\\}) where I is the indicator function. Note that the denominator in the truncated distribution is constant with respect to the x. Notice that in fact f(x|a < X \\\\leq b) is a density: :\\\\int_{a}^{b} f(x|a < X \\\\leq b)dx = \\\\frac{1}{F(b)-F(a)} \\\\int_{a}^{b} g(x) dx = 1 . Truncated distributions need not have parts removed from the top and bottom. A truncated distribution where just the bottom of the distribution has been removed is as follows: :f(x|X>y) = \\\\frac{g(x)}{1-F(y)} where g(x) = f(x) for all y < x and g(x) = 0 everywhere else, and F(x) is the cumulative distribution function. A truncated distribution where the top of the distribution has been removed is as follows: :f(x|X \\\\leq y) = \\\\frac{g(x)}{F(y)} where g(x) = f(x) for all x \\\\leq y and g(x) = 0 everywhere else, and F(x) is the cumulative distribution function.  Expectation of truncated random variable  Suppose we wish to find the expected value of a random variable distributed according to the density f(x) and a cumulative distribution of F(x) given that the random variable, X , is greater than some known value y . The expectation of a truncated random variable is thus: E(X|X>y) = \\\\frac{\\\\int_y^\\\\infty x g(x) dx}{1 - F(y)} where again g(x) is g(x) = f(x) for all x > y and g(x) = 0 everywhere else. Letting a and b be the lower and upper limits respectively of support for the original density function f (which we assume is continuous), properties of E(u(X)|X>y) , where u is some continuous function with a continuous derivative, include: (i) \\\\lim_{y \\\\to a} E(u(X)|X>y) = E(u(X)) (ii) \\\\lim_{y \\\\to b} E(u(X)|X>y) = u(b) (iii) \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}[E(u(X)|X>y)] = \\\\frac{f(y)}{1-F(y)}[E(u(X)|X>y) - u(y)] and \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}[E(u(X)|X (iv) \\\\lim_{y \\\\to a}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}[E(u(X)|X>y)] = f(a)[E(u(X)) - u(a)] (v) \\\\lim_{y \\\\to b}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}[E(u(X)|X>y)] = \\\\frac{1}{2}u'(b) Provided that the limits exist, that is: \\\\lim_{y \\\\to c} u'(y) = u'(c) , \\\\lim_{y \\\\to c} u(y) = u(c) and \\\\lim_{y \\\\to c} f(y) = f(c) where c represents either a or b. Examples The truncated normal distribution is an important example.Johnson, N.L., Kotz, S., Balakrishnan, N. (1994) Continuous Univariate Distributions, Volume 1, Wiley. (Section 10.1) The Tobit model employs truncated distributions. Other examples include truncated binomial at x=0 and truncated poisson at x=0.  Random truncation  Suppose we have the following set up: a truncation value, t, is selected at random from a density, g(t), but this value is not observed. Then a value, x, is selected at random from the truncated distribution, f(x|t)=Tr(x). Suppose we observe x and wish to update our belief about the density of t given the observation. First, by definition: :f(x)=\\\\int_{x}^{\\\\infty} f(x|t)g(t)dt , and :F(a)=\\\\int_{x}^a \\\\left[\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x|t)g(t)dt \\\\right]dx . Notice that t must be greater than x, hence when we integrate over t, we set a lower bound of x. The functions f(x) and F(x) are the unconditional density and unconditional cumulative distribution function, respectively. By Bayes' rule, :g(t|x)= \\\\frac{f(x|t)g(t)}{f(x)} , which expands to :g(t|x) = \\\\frac{f(x|t)g(t)}{\\\\int_{x}^{\\\\infty} f(x|t)g(t)dt} .  Two uniform distributions (example)  Suppose we know that t is uniformly distributed from [0,T] and x|t is distributed uniformly on [0,t]. Let g(t) and f(x|t) be the densities that describe t and x respectively. Suppose we observe a value of x and wish to know the distribution of t given that value of x. :g(t|x) =\\\\frac{f(x|t)g(t)}{f(x)} = \\\\frac{1}{t(\\\\ln(T) - \\\\ln(x))} \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } t > x .

It is approximately eight kilometres north-east of Moe, and 146 kilometres south-east of Melbourne. Prior to 1947 Yallourn North was known as \\"Brown Coal Mine\\". The Post Office opened on 3 September 1917 as Brown Coal Mine and was renamed Yallourn North in 1947. This tiny hilltop town contains many churches, including the only Serbian Orthodox Church and Mosque in the region. Sports available are Australian rules football, cricket, lawn bowls and carpet bowls, netball and angling. There is a Social Golf Club, and pistol club. The town has an Australian Rules football team, Yallourn-Yallourn North, which competes in the Mid Gippsland Football League. History The beginning of a town Yallourn North owes its origins to the discovery of brown coal in the Morwell area of Gippsland, in eastern Victoria. Initially private enterprise unsuccessfully attempted to profit from the large quantity of coal that was accessible close to the surface. The Victorian Mines Department took over the abandoned mine in 1917, after protracted strikes by coal miners in New South Wales threatened Victoria's electricity Supply.Harvey, Colin. Yallourn Power Station. A History 1919 to 1989, p. 8 State Electricity Commission of Victoria. Educating the children In 1917 the need for a school became evident. W. H. Dooley reported that a school should be formed, but not a costly one. The address of the school was given as \\"Great Morwell Coal Mine\\" and a large marquee was initially used as the school building. The school was allocated the temporary number 3967, which is still in use today. After a tear in the marquee during a storm in December 1918, the school was temporarily relocated to Bevis's Pioneer Boarding House until a new structure could be built on the old site. Over the years demand grew, as did the space required.Ringin, Kath. \\"The Old Brown Coal Mine\\", p. 58. National Library of Australia, The current school building was constructed in the late 1960s. Wartime During the Second World War, an area within a radius of from the open cut mine was designated as a Prohibited Area for aircraft. Anti- aircraft defences were erected in late 1941, with the placement of four static Bofors guns to help protect the mine and State Electricity Commission of Victoria (SECV) infrastructure. Each group of four Bofors guns needed 90 people to operate them, but neither the Australian Army nor the Volunteer Defence Corps could find enough available operators.Harvey, Colin. Yallourn Power Station. A History 1919 to 1989, p. 218 State Electricity Commission of Victoria. The location of the Bofors guns was approximately between Boundary Road and Anderson Avenue. Static 3.7 inch Bofors guns at the Brown Coal Mine. The Big Slip The township underwent a massive transformation after 1950. On 29 June 1950, thirty people narrowly escaped death as of earth and brown coal slid into the old open cut. After the slip, a number of owners moved their shops to where they are today, which is the reason why shops at Yallourn North aren't in one central location. The eastern half of town was redesigned, with the addition of streets such as Gooding Street, Low Road, and East Street. The map layout of the Brown Coal Mine before the Big Slip in 1950 The township as it exists today Privatisation of the SECV After the Kennett Government privatised and sold the SECV in 1994, Yallourn North was significantly affected economically. Many people moved away from the area in search of work elsewhere, following the loss of 4,500 jobs (out of 10,000) in the greater Latrobe Valley during the three years to 1993.Bolton, Sue. \\"Unions scuttle La Trobe Valley anti-privatisation campaign\\", The Green left weekly, 4 August 1993. However, over the last 20 years the town has undergone a resurgence, with the economy of Latrobe City now finding its feet, and new families moving in to replace those of old. Monash Hall History Monash Hall, Reserve St, circa 1980. Monash Hall, Reserve St, 2012. After the Big Slip of 1950, the town's shops temporarily moved into the camp recreation building while a new building was sourced. A Nissen hut was brought in pieces from an SECV work yard on trucks, and erected in Reserve Street. Purvis's, Dobinsons Drapery, Meadows Bakery and a hairdresser moved to the hut. The businesses moved out in turn as they each gained their own new locations. Ernie Pincini from Mirboo North then transformed the Nissen hut into a picture theatre. It was supposed to open in November 1955 but given post-war work shortages and huge labour demand elsewhere, it didn't open until June 1961, not long before the first television transmission to the area by GLV-10, which quickly saw the picture theatre's demise. After 1962 the hall was re-opened as a public facility. Also known as Yallourn North Hall, the name Monash Hall adorns the building today. In the 1990s the hall received a minor facelift and coat of paint, and was further improved in 2008, with an upgrade to the kitchen. Monash Hall Clubrooms during construction, 2013. The completed clubrooms prior to the official opening. Present day In October 2013 the regional growth fund assisted in the completion of a $680,000 redevelopment of the hall. The local cricket club, and junior football club agreed to merge their facilities under the one roof at the hall. Eight months of renovations took place resulting in a brand-new multi-purpose commercial kitchen, new club rooms and toilet facilities, as well as extra meeting rooms and wheelchair facilities. It was officially opened by mayor Sandy Cam on 15 October 2013. As well as the sporting groups, common users of the hall include Moartz, Line Dancers, Yallourn North Action Group, and Yallourn North Primary School. It has also held other events recently such as ballet classes and hosted a primary school in the emergency following a fire in the Hazelwood open cut mine.  Places of worship  St Brigid's Catholic Church St. Brigid's Catholic Church In 1933 work on building St. Brigid's commenced, on land donated by the SECV, on the corner of North Road and Reserve Street. It was officially opened and blessed on 1 March 1936 by Bishop Ryan, assisted by Father Nolan, and the first mass was celebrated that same day.Ringin, Kath. \\"The Old Brown Coal Mine\\", p. 167. National Library of Australia, Under Father Walsh, the church was enlarged in 1950 by the addition of the \\"T\\" shaped part at the rear. The original building was lifted and moved at an angle to accommodate the extension on the same block. A few of the parishioners collected money via door knocking to raise extra funds for the work. In December 1979 the house next door became the official Presbytery and was blessed in a ceremony conducted by Bishop Fox. No longer used as a Presbytery, it is once more a private home. St. James Church, on the corner of Reserve and Gooding streets. The Church of England St.James's was built on \\"the hill\\", on a site in Reserve Street, and was dedicated on 17 November 1927.Ringin, Kath. \\"The Old Brown Coal Mine\\", p. 166. National Library of Australia, When the little town of Morwell Bridge had to go because of the expanding Yallourn coal mine, the Church of England building was shifted to Brown Coal Mine to be used as a hall. On the eve of its removal it was set alight and required considerable repair. It served the township for a time and was later removed altogether. The first clergyman was the Reverend Vizard who was sent from Walhalla to the Brown Coal Mine in 1920. The Methodist Church Uniting Church rebuilt after fire.Brown Coal Mine and Yallourn were at first attached to the Morwell circuit and the Superintendent Minister was the Reverend A.G.Day. Before Yallourn was built he conducted services at the school in Brown Coal Mine. In 1923 a Methodist probationer, Reverend E.L.Vercoe, was appointed to the area and was given accommodation in the Eastern Camp. Services were conducted in the camps, homes and the school buildings. Reverend Vercoe purchased a mess room in the 1920s and had it erected at Brown Coal Mine on a site not far from the old Main Street. Voluntary workers altered the windows to make them look more like a church, and a vestry was added. The church was moved to Reserve Street in 1938, by a bullock team. The main building was extended and a larger vestry and a new porch were added, and a stained glass window was fitted. Some years later, what once had been an ablutions block was added to the rear of the church. It was restored to become an all-purpose room, which still serves the community today. In 1977, the Methodist Church Australia-wide combined with the Presbyterian and Congregational Churches to become the Uniting Church in Australia. In the early hours of Boxing Day 1997 the church was badly damaged by fire, and only the community hall at the rear was saved. The church was demolished and a new modern building was constructed on the same site. A Service of Celebration for the opening of the new building was held on 2 April 2000.The Old Brown Coal Mine Museum Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Parish and church community The initial Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church, circa 1980. The Holy Trinity Serbian Orthodox Church today, September 2012 In 1950 a number of Orthodox Serbs came to live in Yallourn and soon wished to establish a Serbian Orthodox Church. On 8 June 1952 the Serbs of Yallourn and surrounding towns convened a general meeting at which the decision was made to establish a church and parish. The following year, Father Theodore Demjanjuk, a Russian by background, was appointed as the first parish priest, and services were initially held in the Anglican church. In 1957 land was obtained from the SECV for the building of the new church on North Road. Consequently, the church hall was built and consecrated in 1975 by Bishop Dimitrije. It has since been widened so that it can hold about 250 people. After Father Theodore, numerous priests served in the parish, while currently the parish priest is Father Milan Milutinovic who holds monthly services. It is the only Serbian Orthodox church in the region.\\"Electoral Representation Review for the Latrobe City Council\\", p 17, Victorian Electoral Commission, 2007. Yallourn North today Yallourn North is still a small and quiet town, but is undergoing continual change. At the , Yallourn North had a population of 1,493. The town historically has a higher percentage of older residents, but many of them are moving into more suitable accommodation, allowing new families to move in. A few new dwellings have been built, along with a rural subdivision outside the township to the east (See: Rennie Property Sales). The town has a local subscription newsletter with a monthly circulation of 700. It also has a Facebook page, YouTube channel, and is currently working on a town website. There is a modestly-sized Foodworks supermarket that services many of the residents' needs. Larger supermarkets, such as Coles, Woolworths and Aldi, are in neighbouring towns within driving distance. Other shops within the town include a fish and chip shop, Sheek Hairdressing, Central Gippsland Family Practice Medical Centre, an op-shop and also the Rossmore Hotel. The town has a local mechanic operating out of the former petrol station. Swimming pools of three different sizes, all solar heated. Skate park, Reserve Street. Recently resurfaced tennis courts, Reserve Street. Synthetic bowling green. There are two main sporting reserves. In town is the Yallourn North Hall and Reserve which consists of Monash Hall, the Junior Football Club, Cricket Club, and Tennis Courts. The other sporting reserve is just out of town to the West and is known as George Bates Reserve. This oval hosts the Senior Football club, Netball club, and on occasion hosts cricket matches. The town also has a modern and centrally located Skate Park and BMX track, as well as a Fire Brigade training track. There is a lawn bowling club in town, as well as a senior citizens club. There is also an angling club, a pistol club, an outdoor swimming pool and Museum. The town has a primary school which has approximately 100 students. It participates in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Gardens program. There is also a kindergarten and pre-school. Two electrical contractors servicing the greater Latrobe Valley region, Contracting Kings and Powersauce Electrical, are resident in the town. Community and events Yallourn North is increasingly community-focused. After the decline in the decades following the privatisation of the SECV, many recent events have assisted in restoration of positive community sentiment. Two large events illustrating this are the Kelso Road Project, and the Yallourn North Christmas Festival. There is also an annual Australia Day breakfast on 26 January at the Lion's park,Latrobe City Council. \\"Australia Day to be celebrated throughout Latrobe\\", Gippsland.com 23 January 2002.Online Media. \\"Australia Day in Latrobe Valley\\", The Latrobe Valley Express, Latrobe Valley, 31 January 2014. as well as a morning ANZAC Day Service on Reserve Street at the memorial on 25 April \\"Northe: Anzac Day Message\\", TRFM 23 April 2014.Latrobe City Council.

Laid out in the 1950s, Rossmore Street runs centrally through the town, and is the site of the Rossmore Hotel. Quarry Road offers superb views of the town. The Kelso Road project The Yallourn North community came together following the deaths of two members of the Sporton family. To assist the family, a dedicated group of 140 volunteers renovated the Sporton family home. The original renovation budget was set at $30,000, but after considerable donations from 208 community members and 70 local businesses, the group managed to raise $48,000 for the work. The final result was an entirely updated home and garden - a far cry from what was originally intended to be a new entrance and a \\"spruced up\\" kitchen, laundry, bathroom and lounge room. Yallourn North Christmas Festival On 5 December 2014, Yallourn North hosted its inaugural Christmas Festival, which began with a Twilight Market at Yallourn North Primary School. 70 stalls were held on the school grounds. This was followed by Christmas carols and a trivia quiz at Monash Hall, Barefoot Bowls at the bowling club, an outdoor cinema, and pool party on following days. \\"1000 shoppers browsed through the stalls\\" at the market, with a further 1000 attending the other events.\\"Yallourn North gets festive\\", Moe and Narracan News, Moe, 15 December 2014.

Zuyev had married the daughter of the Chief-of-staff of the Air Division at the age of 25, and had applied to the test pilot school in Aktyubinsk due to his excellent performance but failed to get selected. Zuyev turned bitter about the rejection and when his marriage fell into difficulties, coupled with his personal doubts about the Soviet system, he decided to defect to the United States of America. Defection Zuyev was an interceptor pilot with the Baku PVO regiment at Gudauta, along the northeast coast of the Black Sea. The day before his defection, he baked a large cake, having mixed a large amount of sleeping pills in the batter. He then announced that his wife was pregnant with a boy (Dmitry Baglay), and invited the personnel in his regiment to celebrate. During the party Zuyev personally handed each coworker a slice, except for four people: the commander who was preparing a flight plan, two mechanics on guard duty, and a unit member who was expected to be at another base.Canadian MiG Flights, Harold Skaarup, iUniverse, 2008 When everyone was asleep, Zuyev cut the telephone lines, then approached the aircraft. The two sentries would not let him near the airplane. Zuyev returned and waited for some time past shift change time. The second shift was incapacitated, so one of the sentries went to the squadron. While he was gone, Zuyev approached the airplane and informed the mechanic on guard duty that his replacement would be late and that Zuyev would fill in. This mechanic, already upset about his relief being late, was happy to hand Zuyev his assault rifle and walk away. The other mechanic found everyone asleep at the squadron, and became suspicious of a problem. He returned to the airplane and confronted Zuyev. Zuyev tried to disarm the mechanic, but failed, shot him with a pistol and wounded him. Zuyev was wounded in the right arm. The aircraft were almost ready and Zuyev took off in one. After takeoff, he had planned to shoot other aircraft on the ground, but failed because he forgot to remove one of the two locks on the gun. He then flew south across the Black Sea to Trabzon, Turkey, where the aircraft was impounded. The plane Zuyev had flown was one that had been in storage, and shreds of tarpaulin were still hanging from parts of the plane after it landed. Aftermath Turkish officials immediately agreed to a Soviet request to return the MiG-29, with a spokesman emphasising Ankara's wish to maintain good ties with the Soviet Union. A Soviet plane with technicians and apparently another pilot had been expected the next day at Ankara, but it showed up later at Trabzon on the same day Zuyev arrived. Controllers refused to grant landing permission.Soviet pilot defects with MiG-29, United Press International, May 20, 1989. The next afternoon, the Soviets were allowed to depart with the airplane, escorted out of Turkish airspace by Turkish Air Force jets.MiG returned to Soviet Union, United Press International, May 21, 1989. Zuyev's first words at the Turkish airfield were: \\"Finally, I - an American!\\" He underwent surgery for his wounds. He was allowed to immigrate to the United States where he settled in San Diego, California, and opened a consulting firm. Zuyev wrote a book titled Fulcrum: A Top Gun Pilot's Escape from the Soviet Empire (). Originally, Zuyev faced criminal charges such as hijacking in the Turkish courts, but the charges were dismissed for political reasons.Fulcrum: A Top Gun Pilot's Escape from the Soviet Empire, pp. 348-350.

Prolific aviation author Yefim Gordon in his 2007 book Mikoyan MiG-29 was sharply critical of Zuyev, referring to a prior suspension of Zuyev for poor discipline and that Zuyev's superiors were considering a dishonorable discharge. Gordon speculated that this is what spurred Zuyev into leaving the Soviet Union.\\"Famous Russian Aircraft: Mikoyan MiG-29\\", Yefim Gordon, Midland Publishing, , 2007. Life in the United States On January 3, 1993, Zuyev revealed that the reason that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 succeeded in crossing over Kamchatka without being shot down was because Arctic gales had knocked out the Soviet radars on Kamchatka ten days previously. Zuyev began working as a consultant for the CIA and Department of Defense. On June 10, 2001, Zuyev died along with another aviator, Jerry \\"Mike\\" Warren, in a crash near Bellingham, Washington, when their Yakovlev Yak-52 entered and failed to recover from an accelerated stall.

Workers' associations first formed in the 1860s which assumed union functions, mutual insurance activities, sponsored candidates for election and campaigned in referendums. In 1873 a number of the associations in the German-speaking areas formed the Workers' Federation (), which represented around 5,000 by the late 1870s and campaigned for legislative reform. In 1880, the Workers' Federation dissolved itself into two separate wings; the Swiss Trade Union Federation (SGB/USS) and the Social Democratic Party. For the most of the latter half of the 20th Century, trade unions enjoyed relatively stable and secure positions within the country's consensus-oriented industrial relations system. However, following the recession of the early 1990s, trade unions came under increasing pressure from employers and the government which promoted the deregulation of labour markets, less binding collective bargaining and weaker wage growth. At present, there are two national trade union centres; the Swiss Trade Union Federation (SGB/USS) with approximately 385,000 members and Travail.Suisse with approximately 170,000 members. The former is associated with socialist political currents in Switzerland, the latter somewhat associated with Christian Democratic currents.

United States Central Command's Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) had the mission of monitoring and controlling the airspace south of the 32nd Parallel (extended to the 33rd Parallel in 1996) in southern and south-central Iraq during the period following the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf War until the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Summary Operation Southern Watch began on 27 August 1992 with the stated purpose of ensuring Iraqi compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 (UNSCR 688) of 5 April 1991, which demanded that Iraq, \\"immediately end this repression and express the hope in the same context that an open dialogue will take place to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected.\\" Nothing in the resolution spelled out the Iraqi no-fly zones or Operation Southern Watch. Following the end of the Gulf War in March 1991, the Iraqi Air Force bombed and strafed the Shi‚Äôite Muslims in Southern Iraq during the remainder of 1991 and into 1992. The U.S. and UK deemed that Saddam Hussein was choosing not to comply with the resolution. Military forces from Saudi Arabia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France participated in Operation Southern Watch. The commander of JTF-SWA, an aeronautically rated United States Air Force (USAF) Major General, assisted by an aeronautically designated United States Navy (USN) Rear Admiral, reported directly to the Commander, United States Central Command (USCENTCOM). Military engagements in Southern Watch occurred with regularity, with Coalition aircraft routinely being shot at by Iraqi air defense forces utilizing surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and anti- aircraft artillery (AAA), although such incidents were usually only reported in the Western press occasionally. An intensification was noted prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, though it was said at the time to just be in response to increasing activity by Iraqi air-defense forces. It is now known that this increased activity occurred during an operation known as Operation Southern Focus. Military operations Immediate postwar At first, Iraqi forces did not attack Coalition aircraft. However, after the United Nations voted to maintain sanctions against Iraq, Iraqi forces began to fire on the aircraft and American E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft reported an unusual amount of Iraqi Air Force activity. On 27 December 1992, a lone Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat crossed into the no-fly zone and flew towards a flight of USAF F-15 Eagles before turning north and using its superior speed to outrun the pursuing Eagles. Later in the day, several Iraqi fighters dodged back and forth across the 32nd parallel, staying out of missile range of American fighters. However, an Iraqi MiG-25 crossed too far and was trapped inside the 32nd parallel by a flight of USAF F-16 Falcons of the 33rd Fighter Squadron. After intelligence verified the aircraft was hostile, the fighter pilot received clearance to fire. The lead plane piloted by then-Lieutenant Colonel Gary North, USAF, fired a missile which destroyed the Iraqi fighter. This was the first combat kill by an F-16 in USAF service, and the first combat kill using the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. On 17 January 1993, a USAF F-16C destroyed an Iraqi MiG-23 Flogger with an AMRAAM missile for the second USAF aerial victory.\\"F-16 Aircraft Database: F-16 Airframe Details for 86-0262.\\" F-16.net. Retrieved: 16 May 2008. On 7 January 1993, Iraq agreed to American, British, and French demands to withdraw their surface-to-air missiles from below the 32nd parallel. However, they did not remove all of them, and U.S. President George H. W. Bush ordered U.S. aircraft to bomb the remaining missile sites. On 13 January, more than 100 American, British, and French aircraft attacked Iraqi missile sites near Nasiriyah, Samawah, Najaf, and Al-Amarah. Around half the Iraqi sites south of the 32nd parallel were hit. On 29 June, a USAF F-4G Phantom II destroyed an Iraqi radar which had illuminated it, and a month later, two U.S. Navy EA-6B Prowlers fired AGM-88 HARM missiles at more Iraqi radars. Operations \\"Vigilant Warrior\\" and \\"Desert Strike\\" The first nine months of 1994 were quiet, and the USAF began to withdraw forces from the region. In October, Saddam deployed two divisions of Iraqi Republican Guard troops to the Kuwaiti border after demanding that UN sanctions were to be lifted, precipitating Operation Vigilant Warrior, the rushing of American troops to the Persian Gulf region. Saddam later withdrew the Iraqi Republican Guard out of the Kuwaiti border due to massive American military buildup. This served to increase Coalition resolve to enforce the no-fly zones and contain Iraqi aggression. On 25 June 1996, terrorists bombed the U.S. base at Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia which housed personnel at King Abdulaziz Air Base supporting Operation Southern Watch. The attack killed 19 American airmen and injured an additional 372 people. This event led to a re-alignment of American forces in Saudi Arabia from Khobar Towers to Prince Sultan Air Base and Eskan Village, with both installations located away from population centers. In August 1996, Iraqi forces invaded the Kurdish regions of northern Iraq and American forces responded with Operation Desert Strike against targets in southern Iraq. As a result, the no-fly zone was extended north to the 33rd parallel. This marked renewed conflict with Iraqi air defenses and several more radars were destroyed by F-16 fighters. Operation \\"Desert Fox\\" F-14B Tomcat of VF-102 (foreground) and an EA-6B Prowler of VAQ-137 - over Iraq during January 1998. On 15 December 1998, France suspended participation in the no-fly zones, arguing that they had been maintained for too long and were ineffective. On 16 December, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered execution of Operation Desert Fox, a four-day air campaign against targets all over Iraq, citing Iraq's failure to comply with UNSC Resolutions. This resulted in an increased level of combat in the no-fly zones which lasted until 2003. Last years On 30 December 1998, Iraqi SA-6 missile sites fired 6 to 8 surface- to-air missiles at American military aircraft. USAF F-16s responded by bombing the sites. On 5 January 1999, four Iraqi MiG-25s crossed into the southern no- fly zone, sparking aerial combat with two USAF F-15 Eagles and two USN F-14 Tomcats. The American fighters fired a total of six missiles at the Iraqi aircraft, but the Iraqi aircraft were able to evade all of the missiles and escape back to the north. On 22 May 2000, it was reported that since execution of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, there had been 470 separate incidents of AAA or surface-to-air missile fire at Coalition aircraft, while at the same time, Iraqi aircraft had violated the southern no-fly zone 150 times. Over the same time period, American aircraft had attacked Iraqi targets on 73 occasions. On 16 February 2001, American and British aircraft launched attacks against six targets in southern Iraq, including command centers, radars and communications centers. Only about 40% of the targets were hit. This operation sparked scathing editorials in the foreign press, which reflected growing world skepticism about American-British policy towards Iraq. Incidents of Coalition planes coming under fire, followed by retaliatory air strikes began to happen on a weekly basis. In late 2001, a Sudanese man with links to al-Qaeda fired a man-portable SA-7 Strela missile at a USAF F-15 Eagle fighter taking off from Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. The missile missed the target and was not detected by the pilot or anyone at the base. Saudi police found the empty launcher in the desert in May 2002, and a suspect was arrested in Sudan a month later. He led police to a cache in the desert where a second missile was buried. In June 2002, American and British forces stepped up attacks on Iraqi air defense targets all over southern Iraq. It was later revealed that this was part of a pre-planned operation called Southern Focus which had the goal of degrading the Iraqi air-defense system in preparation for the planned invasion of Iraq. From August 1992 to early 2001, Coalition pilots had flown 153,000 sorties over southern Iraq. From 1992 to 2003, various Coalition naval assets also supported maritime interdiction operations in the Persian Gulf under the banners of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Northern Watch. Basing and Withdrawal Prior to late February 2003, all USAF, USN, USMC, RAF and French Air Force aircraft based in Saudi Arabia had been \\"defensive\\" assets in support of the defense of Saudi Arabia, e.g., with the exception of AGM-88 HARM missiles carried by USAF F-16CJ and USN or USMC EA-6B aircraft as defense against Iraqi surface-to-air missiles, they carried no \\"offensive\\" air-to-ground ordnance with which to strike ground targets in Iraq in response to hostile actions against Coalition aircraft in Iraqi airspace enforcing UNSCR 688. As a result, strike aircraft with offensive ordnance were limited to USAF A-10, F-15E, F-16C, RAF Tornado GR4, and occasionally USMC F/A-18 or AV-8B aircraft based at Ali Al Salem Air Base and Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait, and USN and USMC F-14, F/A-18 and EA-6B aircraft aboard US aircraft carriers and USMC AV-8B aircraft aboard US amphibious assault ships operating in the Persian Gulf. In addition to USAF E-3 AWACS and E-8 J-STARS command & control aircraft and KC-135 air refueling aircraft based in Saudi Arabia, additional USAF KC-10 and KC-135 air refueling aircraft were also based at Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE, while RAF VC10 K3 refuelers were based at the U.S. Navy's Aviation Support Unit (ASU) at Bahrain International Airport in Bahrain to support these strike aircraft. On 27 February 2003, it was announced that the U.S. would be allowed to launch warplanes with offensive ordnance from its bases inside Saudi Arabia to support the Iraq War ‚Äì and would in turn begin a phased withdrawal from the country.Telegraph.co.uk On 29 April 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that he would be withdrawing U.S. troops from the country, stating that the Iraq War no longer required the support installations within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz had earlier said that the continuing U.S. presence in the kingdom was also putting American lives in danger. All non-Royal Saudi Air Force aircraft and units at Prince Sultan Air Base relocated to other bases in the region, mainly Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar and Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE. This included the Coalition Air Operations Center (CAOC), which had relocated to PSAB from Eskan Village in September 2001, and which now resides at Al Udeid AB.

It contains a mixture of shops and restaurants, with the emphasis on food and drink which is located on the roofs of the shops. Retailers include Sainsbury's, Deichmann, Boots, Argos and Poundland, the upper levels of the centre include a 168-room hotel. It is located on land bounded by High Street, Union Street, Bull Street and Corporation Street, with primary retail frontages on all these streets. It is directly opposite the House of Fraser department store, formerly known as Rackhams. The Martineau Way pedestrian route runs through the centre of Martineau Place, and includes further retail frontages. This also connects the Centre to main thoroughfare New Street (via Union Passage) and to the separate Priory Square shopping centre (via Dalton Way). Original construction The centre was originally developed between 1959 and 1965, as part of a large development for insurance company Commercial Union. It took the name of a street on the site, which was named after the Martineau family, a family that included several Lord Mayors of Birmingham. The original development was designed by J. Seymour Harris & Partners, and was the first slab-and-podium in the commercial centre of the city. A fourteen- storey office tower in the style of the Pirelli Tower in Milan, with tapered ends and a rooftop arcade, sits above the shopping precinct, restaurants and covered parking. 2001 redevelopment The shopping centre levels of Martineau Place were extensively redeveloped in 2001 by the Birmingham Alliance. Detailed planning permission was granted in 1999. Martineau Place was completed in September 2001. As part of the development, the \\"Bull Street Hump\\", a subway system for vehicles and pedestrians, was removed and repaved to create a crossing. This was completed in July 2000. Martineau Way, the pedestrian route that runs through the centre of Martineau Place The undulating topography of the area meant that the area at ground level for Union Street has to be accessed via steps on Bull Street. This topography meant that shops could be created on Bull Street ground level which would generally be underground if located on Union Street. Above the shops, a sheltered public square was created. The same material used to shelter the square has been used to cover the entrance at Union Street and the entrance to a Sainsbury's supermarket. As part of the development, the facade was modernised from the 1960s appearance. A new frontage on Corporation Street was constructed with a circular turret-like structure on the junction of Corporation Street and Union Street forming the entrance to a Gap store. In 2004, contracts were exchanged and the Birmingham Alliance sold the redeveloped shopping centre, raising sale proceeds of ¬£93 million net of costs. The redevelopment of Martineau Place in 2001 had been planned as the first phase of a wider development of the area, with a second phase expected to redevelop further 1960s-era buildings at the other side of Bull Street, including the adjacent shopping centre formerly known as Martineau Square. The completed development originally received a single combined planning approval, and was to be known as \\"Martineau Galleries\\" when completed. However the second phase was not progressed, and the un-modernised part is now called Priory Square. Office block One Martineau Place above the centre, pictured before it was refurbished and converted to a hotel 2016 Hotel development In 2016 One Martineau Place, the 13-storey office building above the development (which had not been part of the 2001 modernisation of the centre, and was by then vacant, having previously been occupied by insurer Aviva) underwent a ¬£35 million refurbishment, and was converted to a 168-room apartment hotel under the Staybridge Suites brand. Recent developments In July 2015, Poundland agreed a ten-year lease on a 30,000 square foot unit on Corporation Street (following a temporary presence in a smaller unit in te centre). Burger King also agreed a 20-year lease on an 8,000 square foot unit that would become its flagship store in Birmingham city centre (relocating from a smaller and less prominent unit inside the centre on Martineau Way). In 2017, the West Midlands Metro was extended running past the northern entrance to Martineau Place, with the Corporation Street tram stop adjacent to the centre. In 2017, the owners of the centre secured flexible use categories for many of the units in the inner Martineau Way part of the development, which had seen higher vacancy levels than the main frontages on the outer part of the development, in order to ensure vacancies could be quickly filled.

He played nine seasons with the Detroit Tigers (1932‚Äì38), Philadelphia Athletics (1943‚Äì44), and Cincinnati Reds (1944). Born in Red Oak, Georgia, Joyner White was known as \\"Jo-Jo\\" because of the way he pronounced the name of his native state of Georgia. The , White batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He began his playing career in minor league baseball in 1928 and after four full years of apprenticeship, he made the Tigers' roster at age 22 at the outset of the season. Outfielder for Tigers' 1934‚Äì35 champs White was the starting center fielder for the Detroit Tigers teams that won back-to-back American League pennants in and , and the 1935 World Series. In 1934, he batted .313, scored 97 runs, and stole 28 bases‚Äîthe second most in the American League. His .418 on-base percentage was seventh best in the league. He played in all seven games of the 1934 World Series, walking eight times and scoring six runs against the Gashouse Gang St. Louis Cardinals, who beat Detroit in seven games. In 1935, White's batting average dropped 73 points to .240, but he still scored 82 runs and was among the AL leaders with 12 triples and 19 stolen bases. He played in five games of the 1935 World Series, scoring three runs with a .417 on-base percentage. White also hit a single in the 11th inning of Game 3 to drive in Marv Owen for the win, contributing to the Tigers' first-ever world championship, as they defeated the Chicago Cubs in six games. White was roommates with Detroit slugger Hank Greenberg for five years. In his autobiography, Greenberg wrote that they had a great relationship and enjoyed being on the road together, though they \\"used to fight the Civil War every night.\\" Greenberg noted that \\"no two people could be more different than me, coming from the Bronx, and Jo- Jo White, claiming he came from Atlanta.\\"Hank Greenberg, \\"Hank Greenberg: The Story of My Life, p. 46 White even confessed once to Greenberg, \\"I thought all you Jews had horns on your head.\\" Greenberg, op. cit., p. 190 Later playing career In 1936, White lost the starting job in center field and remained a backup with the Tigers from 1936 to 1938. After playing in only 55 games in the outfield in 1938, White was frustrated with his limited playing time. After \\"a drink or two\\" on a train ride late in the season, White \\"decided to attack\\" a brand new felt hat purchased by manager Del Baker. Baker finally found out that it was White who had deliberately ruined the hat, and White was traded to the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League on December 12 as part payment for young pitcher Fred Hutchinson.Greenberg, op. cit., p. 123 White played for Seattle for four full seasons (1939‚Äì42), helping them win the PCL pennant in both 1940 and 1941. White returned to the Major Leagues during World War II, following the depletion of the talent pool as top players went into military service. In 1943, he was acquired by the Philadelphia Athletics and played in more games (139) and had more at bats (500) and hits (124) than any other season in his MLB career. After playing 85 games for the A's in 1944, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds in August, finishing his career by playing 24 games for the Reds. In nine MLB seasons, he had a lifetime batting average of .256 in 878 games, with 678 hits, 456 runs scored, 386 walks, 42 triples, and 92 stolen bases. White's playing career did not end in 1944, however. In 1945, he returned to the Pacific Coast League, and he had his finest pro season at age 36: 244 hits, 162 runs scored and a .355 batting average (all leading the PCL) while playing for the Sacramento Solons. The following year, Sacramento sent White back to the Seattle Rainiers, where he made his managerial debut as a playing skipper late in the 1946 campaign. White also managed the Rainiers from 1947 through mid-1949, leading them to the 1948 playoffs. After his release in Seattle in 1949, he concluded his active career as a player only for the PCL Hollywood Stars, appearing in 31 games. Coach and interim manager He then had a long career as a scout, minor league manager and MLB coach, serving on the staffs of the Cleveland Indians (1958‚Äì60), Detroit Tigers (1960), Kansas City Athletics (1961‚Äì62), Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves (1963‚Äì66), and Kansas City Royals (1969), usually as third base coach. He was a longtime associate of manager Joe Gordon, working with him with the Indians, Tigers, Athletics and Royals. Indeed, as a coach under Gordon, White was involved in the bizarre trade of managers between the Indians and Tigers on August 3, 1960. That day, the Indians' Gordon was swapped even-up for Tigers' manager Jimmy Dykes. As the two pilots prepared to change teams, Cleveland needed an interim manager and tabbed White to handle the Indians for their night game with the Washington Senators at Griffith Stadium. In White's only MLB game managed, he oversaw a 7‚Äì4 Indians' win. Mudcat Grant hurled a complete game, supported by second baseman Ken Aspromonte's home run and three runs batted in.1960-8-3 box score from Retrosheet Four days later, it was announced that White also \\"traded\\" teams‚Äîleaving the Indians to rejoin Gordon with Detroit, while Tigers' coach Luke Appling simultaneously quit his post to rejoin Dykes with the Indians.The Associated Press, 4 August 1960 White died at age 77 in Tacoma, Washington. He was inducted posthumously into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1997. His son Mike White, a center fielder and second baseman, played in the Major Leagues for the Houston Colt .45s/Astros in 1963‚Äì65.

Ozerov, portrait by Johann Rombauer Vladislav Aleksandrovich Ozerov () (11 October 1769 ‚Äì 17 September 1816) was the most popular Russian dramatist in the first decades of the 19th century. Ozerov wrote five tragedies \\"in the stilted and sentimental manner of the Frenchified era\\".Vladimir Nabokov. Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse: Commentary. Princeton University Press, 1991. . p. 82. Their success was tremendous, largely owing to the remarkable acting of one of the greatest Russian tragediennes, Ekaterina Semyonova. What the public liked in these tragedies was the atmosphere of sensibility and the polished, Karamzinian sweetness that Ozerov infused into the classical forms. Ozerov's first success was Oedipus in Athens (1804), a wry comment on Alexander I's rumoured privity to the murder of his father Paul. The public was ecstatic about his next tragedy, Fingal (1805), staged with effective sets representing sombre Scottish scenery. Dmitry Donskoy (1807) was staged within days after the Battle of Eylau, when its patriotic ethos was particularly apposite. (It was later used as the basis for an opera of the same name by Anton Rubinstein). His last play was Polyxena (1809), variously assessed as the finest sentimental tragedy in the languageThe Cambridge History of Russian Literature (ed. by Charles Moser). Cambridge University Press, 1992. . p. 122. and the best Russian tragedy on the French classical model.D.S. Mirsky. A History of Russian Literature. Northwestern University Press, 1999. . p. 68. The production of Polyxena turned out to be a flop, largely due to intrigues adding to Ozerov's literary woes. He was forced to leave St. Petersburg for his country estate near Zubtsov, where he reportedly went mad and burnt all his papers. Ozerov's last years were spent in poverty, and his posthumous reputation was damaged by Pushkin's dismissal of his plays as \\"very mediocre\\".

The village is about from the county boundary with Hampshire. The parish includes the hamlets of Cowesfield Green (east of Whiteparish on the A27) and Newton (southwest, near the A36). History Cowesfield was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, together with nearby settlements at Alderstone (now extinct) and Frustfield (which became Whiteparish). The place-name 'Whiteparish' is first attested in 1319. It was earlier recorded as 'la Whytechyrche' in 1278, and 'Album Monasterium' in 1291, which both mean 'white church'.Eilert Ekwall, Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.514. The reference is presumably to a stone or whitewashed church. Local government The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. The parish falls in 'Alderbury and Whiteparish' electoral ward. The ward starts in the northwest at Alderbury and stretches south east to Whiteparish. The ward population taken at the 2011 census was 4,261. Churches The Church of England parish church of All Saints is Grade II* listed. It has 12th-century origins and was restored by William Butterfield in 1870. A painting St Peter denying Christ is by J F Rigaud. A Methodist church was built on Dean Lane in the 19th century. It was sold for residential use circa 2012. Schools Whiteparish All Saints Church of England Primary School teaches children from a nursery class up to year 6. In the middle of Whiteparish, it has about 150 children, some from outside the village. A school for teaching reading, writing, and accounts to twenty poor children had been founded at Whiteparish by the gift of J. Lynch in 1639. In 1833 this school was teaching thirty-five boys. There was also a girls' school, founded in 1722 by the Will of E. Hitchcock, which in 1833 was teaching twenty girls the Church catechism, reading, and needlework.\\"Whiteparish ‚Äì Boys' School\\" and \\"Whiteparish ‚Äì Girls' School\\" in Public Charities: Analytical digest of the Reports made by the Commissioners of inquiry into charities.

It received the Public Choice Award at the 2005 World Soundtrack Academy. Overview The film, directed by Oliver Stone, portrays the life of Alexander the Great in an epic style that is also reflected in the score. Alexander was a king (basileus) of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon who expanded the Hellenistic civilization with his conquests on the 4th Century BC; Vangelis, himself a Greek, was already famous for his scores to Chariots of Fire, Blade Runner and Conquest of Paradise. He was directly approached by Stone. :\\"I tried to remember how it was to live at the time, to be there. At the same time, I must speak the music language which is understandable today, because we're addressing thousands, millions in the audience.\\" - Vangelis in documentary Vangelis Scores AlexanderVangelis Scores Alexander, a documentary available on the official soundtrack website, on the computer game, and on some DVD releases of the film :\\"You could say that I composed it from memory, which is the most important thing in all of us... when you close your eyes, and make yourself available, you can really remember, and imagine certain things. And all of those ethnic, musical flavors will come to you. It's a universal music language.\\" - Vangelis on ethnic music from Alexander's time Release The CD was released in each market with one of three different covers. In some markets, a bonus track (not used in the film) was included, titled \\"Bizarre Bazaar\\". Charts At the Billboard New Age Albums chart peaked at #5 position. In Portugal reached #28, Belgium #96, and France #97. Composition Vangelis composed, arranged, and produced the music on his synthesizer since September 2003, and took almost a year to score due to re-editing of the film. He recalls \\"with Alexander I started working immediately, because Oliver needed music for his shooting. So some of the music, for the dances, for instance, I composed before the scenes were shot, working with the choreographer and so forth\\". He gave it to Nic Raine, who orchestrated it and conducted the result, with violinists Vanessa-Mae and Dominique Lemonnier, harpist Maria Bildea, the Epris Polyphonic Ensemble, tenor Konstantinos Paliatsaras, singer Irina Valentinovna Karpouchina, with around 200 players in the orchestra. According to Vangelis, 40% of the album is live while 60% synth. The soundtrack features a combination of synthesisers, acoustic instruments and percussion with the choral lines, such as \\"Titans\\" and \\"Drums of Gaugamela\\". The \\"Eternal Alexander\\" and \\"Tender Memories\\" are more reflective tracks with an exotic oriental flavour, beginning with a folk tune, and feature a chorus, symphony orchestra and guitar. \\"Gardens of Delight\\" and \\"Roxane‚Äôs Dance\\" for example feature violin, harp and percussion. Vangelis recorded double amount of music than was released on CD, however, not all film music was included or had the same editing like in the album, or was later released. The one track that wasn't heard in the movie at all, \\"One Morning at Pella\\", showed up in the \\"Final Cut\\" version of the movie. Reception The soundtrack has received mixed reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic observed that \\"what begins as a Blade Runner-esque wash of atmospheric, keyboard-driven subtlety quickly deteriorates into a thick wall of stock heroic motifs, swelling brass, and thunderous percussion\\", and gave the soundtrack two-and-half stars out of five. David Coscina of Film Score Monthly considered the soundtrack disappointing due to lack of full and expansive harmonies; \\"Titans\\", \\"the main theme from the film and the main harmonic body of this piece is a simple IV-I progression with little to no deviation in its melodic content from the basic triadic chords\\", concluding \\"if there were some interesting textures that compensate for this shortcoming, then I could find some merit in his music. But the antiquated synthesizer sounds only make the listening experience all the worse\\", and scored it one star out of five. Christian Clemmensen of Filmtracks.com praised the soundtrack for \\"a continuation of Vangelis' trend towards seeking the perfect harmony between synthetic and orchestral elements\\", \\"can be divided into two sections: that in which Vangelis unleashes the ensembles and his electronics in a massive bombardment of rhythm and theme, and those in which he attempts to provide realistic source-like underscore for the erotic and/or Eastern sequences\\", concluding \\"on its attempts to insert a synthetic element into music for this general historical period, Alexander succeeds better than Zimmer's Gladiator ever did\\", scoring it five stars out of five. Messrob Torikian of Soundtrack.Net gave the album 4/5 score, concluding \\"strong themes, haunting melodies, and the ever present feeling of a vast army always on the march make the album immensely enjoyable\\". Jennifer Ravensdale of Sputnikmusic in review summary concluded \\"always exemplifying the moment, yet constantly struggling to create an identity for itself\\", and scored it 3/5. Peter Simons of Movie Music UK concluded that \\"a few good tracks save the album from being a complete waste, but they hardly outweigh the simplicity of the composition and the annoyance of the endlessly repeated percussion\\", and scored it 2/5. James Southall of Movie Wave rated the album 3/5, saying \\"Vangelis pulls out every imaginable clich√©, but somehow the album features a not inconsiderable amount of highly- entertaining music\\". Adrian Edwards of Gramophone noted that \\"Eternal Alexander\\" and \\"Tender Memories\\" could become the \\"most frequently aired themes\\", concluding that \\"a number of tracks segue from one to another, carrying the mood through and avoiding the fragmentary nature of soundtrack listening. A huge array of credits testify to a job well done\\".

The play premiered at the Prince of Wales Theater in Birmingham, where it was successful enough to be moved to the Haymarket Theatre in London, on 30 April 1864.Robertson, T. W. David Garrick: The Play and the Novel It was a major success for the actor Edward Askew Sothern, who played the title role, but came later to be associated with the actor Charles Wyndham. The play was designed as a star vehicle, since the principal actor has to portray David Garrick himself as an actor giving a performance. A scene from the play was painted by Edward Matthew Ward, a friend of Sothern's. The play was Robertson's first major commercial success and was frequently revived throughout the Victorian era and beyond. Several silent films were made based on David Garrick, including versions in 1913 (starring Seymour Hicks and Ellaline Terriss), 1914 and 1916. A 1923 book, Public Speaking Today, recommends it for performance by high school students alongside The Importance of Being Earnest and The Rivals. In 1922, the play was adapted as a comic opera by Reginald Somerville and played at the Queen's Theatre.Parker, John. Who's Who in the Theatre: A Biographical Record of the Contemporary Stage\\", Small, Maynard & Company (5th Edition, 1925) History Garrick and his wife, Eva Marie Veigel, painted by William Hogarth. The painting is in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. The play was evidently written in 1856, after Robertson saw a French theatre troupe performing Sullivan; but the new play was rejected by every theatre manager Robertson took it to. He sat on it for many years, then eventually showed it to Sothern, who took interest in the project. Reportedly, as Sothern read the play aloud to his manager John Buckstone ‚Äì > [Sothern] frequently interrupted himself with such remarks as \\"Capital\\" > \\"First-rate!\\" \\"Strong situation!\\" and \\"I like that!\\" But when he came to the > party scene, in which David acts like a madman, Sothern became so excited > that he began to smash the glasses and upset the furniture. \\"I think that > will do, Bucky?\\" he said to his manager. \\"Yes, it will do,\\" replied > Buckstone, \\"and I rather like that fellow Chevy [sic].\\"The Making of > Victorian Drama, by Anthony Jenkins. After some revisions at Sothern's request, Robertson was able to sell the play for a sum of ¬£10.Famous Actor Families in America, by Montrose Jonas Moses Robertson's story of Garrick has very little to do with fact: among other things, it ends with Garrick presumably married to a woman named Ada Ingot‚ÄîGarrick's real wife was Eva Marie Veigel. Robertson was quoted as saying, in response to critics of this historical inaccuracy, \\"The real, actual Mr. David Garrick was not married until the year 1749. Whatever adventures may have occurred to him before that time are a legitimate theme for speculation.\\" He then suggests that Ada and Garrick could have been prevented from marrying by death, break-up or other external factors, and thus his story would not be contradictory to history. The story is, according to the title page of most printed versions, \\"Adapted from the French of Sullivan, which was founded on a German Dramatization of a pretended Incident in Garrick's Life.\\" Sullivan was a French comic play of 1852 by Anne-Honor√©- Joseph Duveyrier de M√©l√©sville, which Adams' Dictionary of Drama claims to have been based on Joseph Bouchardy's 1836 short story Garrick M√©decin. The confusion with the \\"German dramatization\\" appears to be thus ‚Äì Garrick M√©decin was adapted into another French play entitled Le Docteur Robin, which became widely known through a German translation. A misunderstanding caused the belief that Sullivan was actually based on Doktor Robin rather than the two being based on a mutual source, as evidenced in an 1895 article in The New York Times. Another German play, Garrick in Bristol, added to the confusion.\\"Sir Charles Wyndham: A Biography\\" by T. Edgar Pemberton Characters *David Garrick, A famous actor *Mr. Simon Ingot, A wealthy businessman, father to Ada *Squire Richard Chivy, Ada's distant cousin and her fianc√© *Mr. Alexander Smith, A friend of Ingot *Mr. Brown, A friend of Ingot, father of Araminta *Mr. Jones, Friend of Ingot and paramour of Araminta *Thomas, Ingot‚Äôs butler *George, Garrick‚Äôs valet *Ada Ingot, Betrothed unwillingly to Chivy, in love with Garrick from afar *Mrs. Smith, wife of Mr. Smith *Miss Araminta Brown, Daughter of Mr. Brown, beloved of Mr. Jones *Two Servants, Ingot‚Äôs employees Plot summary The action takes place in 1740s London. A young woman, Ada, has developed a crush on the actor David Garrick so strong that she refuses to accept a marriage arranged by her father, Mr. Ingot. Ingot contrives to meet with Garrick and initially tries to persuade him to leave the country or give up acting, but when Garrick learns the reason, he assures Ingot that he will be able to cure Ada of her attraction and asks Ingot to arrange a meeting with her. Garrick is sympathetic to Ada's plight because he himself has fallen in love with a girl he doesn't know, but he promises Ingot that he will not make any romantic moves towards Ada. Garrick is invited to a dinner party at Ingot's house, where he is stunned and horrified to realise that Ada is the very girl he had been admiring from afar, but because of his promise, he goes through with his plan. He spends the evening antagonizing the other guests and pretending to be a drunk and a gambler. When he leaves, Ada is crushed, but she agrees to go through with the marriage her father intends for her. Her fianc√© Richard Chivy arrives, actually as drunk as Garrick was just pretending to be, and he tells the Ingots about how he just met David Garrick at his club and listened to him tell a story of how he had spent an evening pretending to be a scoundrel so as to cure a girl of her attraction to him. Chivy does not recognise that the story is about Ada and her father, though they both recognise themselves, and Ada is cheered by the news. Chivy then mentions how someone at the club insulted the girl and father of Garrick's story, and that Garrick is now scheduled to fight a duel with the man. The next day, Ada goes to Garrick's home, both to escape her impending marriage and to try to stop the duel set for later in the day. Chivy has followed her, and she hides from him. Garrick learns that Ada is hiding in the room, but he plays dumb and offers to help Chivy look for her, until the two men leave together for the duel. Not long after they leave, Ingot arrives and finds Ada. He says he will disown her because of how she has misbehaved. Ada is so upset by the news that she faints. Ingot tries to tell her he didn't mean it, but when he sees she has fainted unconscious he goes to get help. Ada then awakens, the last thing she heard being that she was disowned. Garrick eventually comes into the room, having won the duel, and tries to comfort Ada. He convinces her that her father loves her and that she should listen to him. Ingot overhears this and decides that David Garrick is a better man than Chivy, who by now has left in pursuit of Garrick's housemaid, and so he agrees to allow Ada to marry him. Notable scene One of the play's defining moments is the point when Garrick's feigned drunkenness appears to work, and Ada forces him to leave the party. Garrick makes an exit of high comedy, improving upon past insults to the other guests and quoting from Shakespeare's Coriolanus before destroying a window fixture with his exit: ADA. If you do not leave, the servants shall turn you out. GARRICK. And serve him right, too. (releases SMITH, and goes up C., a little. To INGOT, aside). Get me out of this, I can't bear it longer. (aloud) Put out old Coco. I am going. Good-bye, mother of seventy children. MRS. SMITH. Oh! GARRICK. Good-bye, Cold Muffins. SMITH. Cold Muffins! GARRICK. Farewell! (pathetically.) Farewell, and treasure deep that which I love the most yet leave behind. Farewell! SMITH (follows GARRICK up C.) Jones, kick him out. GARRICK (turns fiercely and SMITH runs down L. C., front).

Despising, for you, the City, thus I turn my back: There is a world elsewhere.\\" (snaps his fingers end lifts his foot as if in a contemptuous kick. Up to R. U. E., tears down curtain of R. U.

Early Victorian DramaThe Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907‚Äì21). Volume XIII. The Victorian Age, Part One. Edited by A. W. Ward and A. R. Waller. Robertson originally fashioned the story as a novel, David Garrick: A Love Story, which was first printed in 1864 as a serial in the magazine The Young Englishwoman.\\"Peeps into the Past\\" However, in the 1865 printing in book form, Robertson says in his preface that it was the other way around, and his novel was adapted from his play. While the plots are virtually identical, the tone of the novelisation is much more sentimental and somber. Whereas in the play, the wedding between Ada and Chivy is called off after Chivy openly races off in pursuit of Garrick's housemaid and carelessly leaves out embarrassing love letters sent between himself and other women, the novel shows the wedding cancelled when it is revealed that Chivy (called Raubreyne in the book) has an illegitimate child with a woman he has falsely promised to marry; and even then, Ada is only permitted to marry Garrick after \\"dying of love\\" leaves her otherwise incurably bedridden for several months. The element of the duel is also removed from the novel. In the introduction to the 2009 reprint, it is speculated that the \\"less farcical tone\\" may have more closely resembled Robertson's early drafts of the play, before Sothern's contributions.Felix, Talia (ed.) \\"David Garrick: The Play and the Novel\\", CreateSpace, 30 January 2009 While much of the humour was removed in the novelisation, a great deal of exposition was added, and the story actually begins on the day Garrick and Ada first meet. Many of the character's names were altered from the play. Simon Ingot becomes Alderman Trawley, Richard Chivy becomes Robert Raubreyne, \\"Sawney\\" Smith becomes \\"Sammy\\" Smith, and Ada Ingot becomes Ada Trawley.

History Bulcher was founded in the spring of 1872 when John A. Davis moved his family into the area. The threat of Indian raids had dwindled and the vicinity offered a voluminous amount of cheap, fertile farm land laid out just south of the Red River. It didn't take long for others to follow the lead of the Davises. The population shot up to 250 by the end of a decade and a school house was established along with a handful of other businesses. Postmaster Matthew A. Morris founded the post office in 1874 and settler William H. Cox built a cotton gin in 1875. The census remained on a slight downward slide from 1887 into the 1900s due to the bypass of the railway 10 miles south of town until the village enjoyed a small oil boom in the summer of 1926. The community was briefly rejuvenated by the discovery but the well had run dry by the early 1930s and only 40 residents resided in Bulcher in the year 1933. The population remained roughly unchanged for the next fifty years until the last of the town's citizens began to migrate in the late 1980s, leaving the site with 0 permanent residents for much of the 1990s and early 2000s. Today, just 6 people remain. Today, it is a popular area for self-guided foliage tours, as well as home to a 2500-acre (10 km) off-road motorcycle park popular with riders from all over the United States. The park is host to the annual Last Man Standing rough-terrain motorcycle race. Almost all of the vacated buildings have been completely destroyed due to vandalism and just a broken down church remains along with the old abandoned Valley Creek school house hidden in the woodlands two miles east of town.

This plant, and the variegated cultivar 'Variegatum', have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Description Trachelospermum jasminoides is an evergreen woody liana growing to high. When they meet a wet surface, they emit aerial weed roots, otherwise they surround the support (they are twining). If cut, like most Apocynaceae, they exude a white latex, resembling sticky milk. Young twigs, initially pubescent, become glabrous with age. The leaves are opposite, oval to lanceolate, long and broad, with an entire margin and an acuminate apex. Dark green in summer, the leaves turn bronze in winter. Inflorescence The fragrant flowers are white, diameter, with a tube-like corolla opening out into five petal-like lobes. The white, actinomorphic flowers have a calyx formed by five narrow, smooth, reflexed sepals 2‚àí5 mm , much shorter than the corolla tube. The latter has a dilated tube in the middle, 5‚àí10 mm long, terminating in 5 obliquely bypassed lobes, all curved, resembling a helix turning counterclockwise. The five stamens are inserted in the middle of the corolla tube. The ovary is formed of a style and two carpels, with five glands at its base. They are grouped in paniculate, terminal and axillary cymes. The fruit is a slender follicle long and broad, containing numerous seeds. Cultivation Trachelospermum jasminoides is commonly grown as an ornamental plant and houseplant. In gardens, public landscapes, and parks it is used as a climbing vine, a groundcover, and a fragrant potted plant on terraces and patios. It will flower in full sun, partial shade, or total shade, and requires well-drained soil (if constantly kept damp it may succumb to fungal infection), moderate water, moderate fertilizer, and a climbing structure (whether a trellis or another plant is secondary). Propagation is most commonly done with cuttings/clones. It is widely planted in California and also particularly in the Southeastern United States, where its hardiness is confined to USDA Zones 8‚Äì10. It is debated however, where the common name for this plant, confederate jasmine, comes from. While some dictionaries (such as Merriam-Webster and dictionary.com) suggest that the name comes from the plant's common cultivation in the southern United States, others argue that the term actually comes from Malaysia, and the former Malay confederacy. It gets another of its common names, trader's compass, from an old Uzbekistan saying that it pointed traders in the right direction, provided they were of good character. It is also called star jasmine in Europe and Chinese jasmine or Chinese ivy in Asia. Its irritating, milky latex-like sap makes it resistant to the depredations of Australian possums.Miller, Ming, horticulturalist, Bunnings Box Hill (pers comm 29 Dec 2013) Uses A valuable perfume oil is extracted from the steam distilled or tinctured flowers and used in high end perfumery. In a dilute form, tinctured flowers are much used in Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai incenses. A bast fibre is produced from the stems.

She shared this title with another American-built ship, the steamship Adriatic until the launch of Great Eastern in 1860. She was also the largest full rigged ship ever built in the United States. Construction Great Republic, as originally built in 1853 Designed by naval architect and shipbuilder Donald McKay as a four-deck four-masted medium clipper barque, Great Republic--at 4,555 tons registryMost likely Gross Register Tonnage or GRT measurement--was intended to be the most profitable wooden sailing ship ever to ply the Australian gold rush and southern oceans merchant trade. The ship's launch was planned for September 4, 1853‚Äîbuilder Donald McKay's birthday‚Äîbut it was postponed to October 4 due to problems with the timber supplies. The City of Boston made the launch a public holiday.J. Ernest Kerr, Imprint of the Maritimes, 1959, Boston: Christopher Publishing, p. 135 Between 30,000 and 50,000 spectators attended, among them Ferdinand Laeisz of the Flying P-Line of Hamburg. The ship was christened by Captain Alden Gifford using a bottle of pure Cochituate water. The ship's name was drawn from the title of a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. After outfitting, Great Republic sailed in ballast from Boston to New York, where in December 1853 her first cargo was loaded. Currier and Ives print of Great Republic Great Republic required \\"1,500,000 feet of pine ... 2,056 tons of white oak, 336¬Ω tons of iron, and 56 tons of copper\\" - about three times as much pine as was typically required for a large clipper ship. The Essex Institute Historical Collections provide a very detailed description of Great Republic in Volume LXIII, published in 1927. Fire and re-rigging On December 26, 1853 a fire broke out in the buildings of the Novelty Baking Company on Front Street near the piers where Great Republic and several other wooden merchant vessels were moored. The fire quickly spread to the packet ship Joseph Walker, and to the clippers White Squall, Whirlwind, and Red Rover, with sparks from the fire showering onto the deck of the Great Republic, whose crew was mustered shortly after midnight to unsuccessfully dowse the sails. The first three ships were destroyed; Red Rover was damaged, and Great Republic burnt to near the waterline and was scuttled at dawn to save her hull at dock., accessed May 30, 2018. Bloated by grain which burst her seams, Great Republic was declared a total loss, and Donald McKay, who was said never to have gotten over the tragic event, was compensated by insurers. The sunken hulk was sold by the insurance underwriters to Captain Nathaniel Palmer, working on behalf of A. A. Low and Bro., who salvaged and rebuilt it as a three-deck vessel with reduced masts. 300px Voyages Still the largest clipper ship in the world at 3,357 tons registry, Great Republic, under command of Captain Joseph Lymburner, started back in merchant service on February 24, 1855. Her maiden voyage brought her to Liverpool in 13 days. Great Republic was \\"chartered by the French Government to bring munitions and troops to the Crimea,\\" and served in the general cargo and guano trades. In 1862 the fourth mast was removed and the others re-rigged, and the clipper became a three-masted full-rigged ship, a so-called three-skysail-yarder. In 1864 Captain Lymburner retired and the ship's registry moved to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. In 1869 she was sold to the Merchants' Trading Company of Liverpool and renamed Denmark. She continued sailing until March 5, 1872 when a hurricane off Bermuda caused the ship to leak badly and she was abandoned. Records set During her 19-year merchant career, Great Republic proved to be very fast under leading breeze conditions and often out-distanced the fastest merchant steamers on Mediterranean routes. Sailing around Cape Horn, Great Republic averaged to set a record by logging in a single day. Comparison to other large wooden sailing ships A wooden sailing vessel larger than Great Republic was launched nearly three decades earlier in June 1825: the 5,294-ton Baron of Renfrew was a disposable ship built for a single voyage from Quebec to London. There it would be dismantled and sold piecemeal to English shipbuilders at premium prices since large timbers were in short supply. The vessel itself was exempt from British taxes imposed on \\"oak and square pine timber cargoes\\" and thus gained an economic advantage. Unfortunately, Baron of Renfrew was wrecked as it was being towed toward London in a storm. Although reports differ, most indicate the timbers were recovered and sold, and the venture was ultimately successful. Nevertheless, when the British tax on timber cargoes was changed shortly afterwards, the economic advantage disappeared and disposable ship construction ceased. Great Republic was the largest, but not the longest wooden sailing ship ever built. Despite her 400 ft length overall, the record of being the longest wooden ship is held by the six-masted schooner Wyoming built at the Percy & Small shipyard, Bath, Maine, in 1909. Her overall length including her -long jibboom and her protruding spanker boom was , on deck. Sailing card Further reading *Francis B. C.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii Chow was the third of sixteen children and the first son born to Sun Chow Hoon (AKA Ah Hoon Chow) and Rose Kalamalio Naehu. Chow's father came to Hawaii at the age of 19 and worked in a laundromat as a laborer. His mother was of Hawaiian descent. One of his brothers, John Chow- Hoon, would also become a well-known martial artist. Chow left school at age eleven when he was in the sixth grade. Training and lineage Chow studied several types of martial arts as a young man. These styles most likely included: boxing, wrestling, jujutsu, and karate. Though he stood no more than 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall, he was well known for his powerful breaking techniques. Chow eventually studied ‚ÄúKenpo Jiujutsu‚Äù or ‚ÄúKosho Ryu Kenpo‚Äù under the direction of James Mitose. As he progressed he often tested his prowess against US military personnel in street fights. In spite of this, it was never recorded that Chow ran afoul of the law. William Chow became one of five people awarded black belts under Mitose. Chow's black belt certificate was signed by Thomas Young. Young was Mitose's senior student and instructor. Instruction style Chow had a reputation for being a tough instructor, although this quote from Nick Cerio seems to indicate that the intent was to train, not to harm: > I got banged here and there with the old man, but not in a malicious way, > Chow was tough and gave you a good strong workout. He was adamant about > physical conditioning and when he did a technique, he meant business. I > believe he didn‚Äôt have the intention of hurting you. It was just that he was > so powerful and quick that he didn‚Äôt realize himself how much damage he did > when he demonstrated a technique on you.Breen 1997 Influence Kenpo Karate In 1944 Chow began teaching what he called ‚ÄúKenpo Karate‚Äù at the Nuuanu YMCA in Honolulu. As Mitose had referred to his art as \\"kenpo jujitsu,\\" rather than \\"kenpo karate,\\" this was a departure for Chow. His many students included Edmund Parker, Joseph D. and Adriano D. Emperado, Ron Alo, Anthony S.Agisa,Goshin Kenpo Ka Ju Abe KAMAHOAHOA, Bobby Lowe, Ralph Castro, Sam Kuoha, Matias Ulangca Jr, Bill Chun Sr., John Leone, William G. (Billy) Marciarelli (Kachi/Kenpo), Walter Liu, and Paul Pung. He did not create or perform any kata but focused more on individual techniques. Spread of Kenpo Karate William Chow's legacy grew as kenpo spread to the United States mainland with its introduction by Edmund Parker and other students of Chow such as Ralph Castro (Shaolin Kenpo), Adriano Emperado (Kajukenbo, Karazenpo go shinjutsu) and later from George Pesare, founder of the East Coast branch of Karazenpo/Kempo, and his student Nick Cerio, who were instrumental in bringing kenpo to students in the eastern United States. Additional students such as Anthony S. Agisa co-founder of ( Goghin Kenpo Ka Ju ), Tony Agisa, Carmelo Romano, and Ron Alo who was one of the first practitioners to bring Kara-Ho Kempo to the mainland, where he taught Chow's art in Southern California before developing his own Alo Kenpo system. Warrior ethos In spite of his heavy influence on the martial arts in the United States and his many notable students, Chow never had a dojo of his own, often teaching in the park and is thought to have lived in near poverty much of the time. Cerio once stated, \\"He was a very cautious individual who had no business sense whatsoever.\\" Chow referred to his style as an ‚ÄúWar Art‚Äù and focused largely on techniques that he felt worked in the streets. Death Shortly before his death in 1987, Chow renamed his system Kara-Ho Kempo. Chow died of a cardio-ventricular accident due to hypertension.Kuoha, Sam with Ka'imi Kuoha.

Book  Love, Money, and Parenting. How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids Published by Princeton University Press (January 2019, ). Love, Money, and Parenting. How Economics Explains the Way We Raise Our Kids by Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti proposes an international and historical look at how parenting choices change in the face of economic inequality. Parents everywhere want their children to be happy and do well. Yet how parents seek to achieve this ambition varies enormously. For instance, American and Chinese parents are increasingly authoritative and authoritarian, whereas Scandinavian parents tend to be more permissive. Why? Love, Money, and Parenting investigates how economic forces and growing inequality shape how parents raise their children. From medieval times to the present, and from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden to China and Japan, Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti look at how economic incentives and constraints‚Äîsuch as money, knowledge, and time‚Äîinfluence parenting practices and what is considered good parenting in different countries. Through personal anecdotes and original research, Doepke and Zilibotti show that in countries with increasing economic inequality, such as the United States, parents push harder to ensure their children have a path to security and success. Economics has transformed the hands-off parenting of the 1960s and '70s into a frantic, overscheduled activity. Growing inequality has also resulted in an increasing \\"parenting gap\\" between richer and poorer families, raising the disturbing prospect of diminished social mobility and fewer opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. In nations with less economic inequality, such as Sweden, the stakes are less high, and social mobility is not under threat. Doepke and Zilibotti discuss how investments in early childhood development and the design of education systems factor into the parenting equation, and how economics can help shape policies that will contribute to the ideal of equal opportunity for all. The book has been listed among the Ten Best Parenting Book of the Decade by Fatherly. It has also been selected by China's version of the Financial Times ‚ÄúEconomist's Book List: Top Ten Good Books for the Spring Festival‚Äù  Selected publications  His research interests include economic growth and development, the economic development of China, political economy, macroeconomics, international economics, and economics and culture.           Awards  In 2009, Zilibotti received the Yrj√∂ Jahnsson Award of the European Economic Association for ‚Äúgreatly [improving] our understanding of how technological innovation affects economic growth at different stages of economic development.

It is one of the most commonly used PBR ligands due to its high affinity for the PBR in all species, although it is starting to be replaced by newer and more selective ligands. Early autoradiographic studies using tritiated PK-11195 ([3H]-PK11195) demonstrated that in the central nervous system (CNS) of rodents, it binds primarily to the ependymal walls, choroid plexus, and olfactory bulb. However, in the injured nervous system there is a robust and widespread increase in [3H]-PK11195 binding. The binding sites have since been determined to be on glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating macrophages. The binding of [3H]-PK11195 is considered to be a useful tool in the assessment of neuronal damage. In addition to being a marker of neuronal damage in animal models of CNS damage, PK-11195 has been used successfully with human brain imaging techniques. [11C](R)-PK11195 has been used in positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to visualize brain inflammation in patients with neuronal damage. Increases in [11C](R)-PK11195 binding have been reported in patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury and in patients with chronic neurodegenerative conditions including Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. The first high-resolution 3D solution structure of mammalian (mouse) translocator protein (TSPO) in a complex with its diagnostic PK11195 ligand was determined by means of NMR spectroscopy techniques by scientists from the Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen in Germany in March 2014L. Jaremko, M. Jaremko, K. Giller, S. Becker, M. Zweckstetter, Structure of the mitochondrial translocator protein in complex with a diagnostic ligand, Science, 343 (2014) 1363-1366 and has a PDB id: 2MGY. The complex stoichiometry was found to be 1 : 1 as the one consistent set of 1H ligand resonances was found with the NOE contacts to five transmembrane helices (TM) in the upper cytosolic part of the protein channel. Residues involved in the ligand binding having direct NOE contacts with the ligand were identified and are as follows A23, V26, L49, V26, A50, I52, W107, L114, A147, L150. These residues are wrapped around the PK11195 ligand forming a stable hydrophobic binding pocket that can be also regarded as the hydrophobic core of the complex. The mammalian TSPO in a complex with diagnostic ligand is monomeric. The loop located in between TM1 and TM2 helices closes the entrance to the space between helices in which are bound with PK11195 molecule. Site- directed mutagenesis studies of mTSPO revealed that region important for PK11195 binding comprise amino acids from 41 to 51, because the deletion of this region resulted in the decrease in PK11195 binding.J.

That it was early is a reasonable conjecture, considering the facilities for communication with the East which the South of Italy possessed. The first indication that Amalfi was a Christian community is supplied by Pope Gregory the Great, who wrote in January 596 to the Subdeacon Antemius, his legate and administrator in Campania, ordering him to constrain within a monastery Primenus, Bishop of Amalfi, because he did not remain in his diocese, but roamed about.Reg., V, xiv; cf. Jaff√©, Regesta Pontificum Romanorum, 1403. The regular list of bishops began in 829. It was raised to Metropolitan Archbishopric of Amalfi by Pope John XV in 987, having lost territory to establish the dioceses of Capri, of Lettere, of Minori and of Scala. In 1206, it gained territory from the suppressed Roman Catholic Diocese of Nuceria. And after the completion, also in 1206, of the Cathedral of St. Andrew (Duomo), the relics of the Apostle of that name, who was the patron saint of Amalfi, were taken from Constantinople and brought there by Cardinal Pietro of Capua, an Amalfitan who took part in the sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. On 10 October 1384 it lost territory to establish the Diocese of Nuceria On 27 June 1818 it lost its status as a metropolitan archdiocese and became the Archdiocese of Amalfi, despite having gained territories from the suppressed dioceses of Minori and of Ravello and Scala. In the early 20th century, archdiocese had about 36,000 inhabitants, 54 parishes and 279 diocesan priests. On 30 September 1986 the diocese was renamed the \\"Archdiocese of Amalfi‚ÄìCava de‚Äô Tirreni\\", having gained territory from and absorbing the title of the suppressed Roman Catholic Diocese of Cava de‚Äô Tirreni. On 20 August 2012 it gained territory from the Territorial Abbey of Santissima Trinit√† di Cava de Tirreni.

The wing is an Air Combat Command gained F-16C/D Fighting Falcon wing which deploys worldwide and executes fighter sorties to destroy enemy forces with conventional munitions. Units The 114th FW consists of the following units: * 114th Operations Group : 175th Fighter Squadron * 114th Maintenance Group * 114th Mission Support Group * 114th Medical Group History On 16 April 1956, the South Dakota Air National Guard 175th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 114th Fighter-Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 175th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 114th Headquarters, 114th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 114th Combat Support Squadron, and the 114th USAF Dispensary. During the 1950s and 1960s, the unit was upgraded by ADC as newer interceptors became available to the Air National Guard. F-89 Scorpions were received in 1958 and F-102A Delta Dagger supersonic aircraft in 1960. Tactical Air Command A-7D Corsair II 70-933, about 1980 In 1970, Aerospace Defense Command was reducing the CONUS interceptor force, as the chances of a bomber attack by the Soviet Union seemed remote in the age of Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). The Group was transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) on 23 May 1970 and was re-designated as the 114th Tactical Fighter Group. The 175th Tactical Fighter Squadron began receiving F-100 Super Sabre tactical fighters that were being withdrawn from service in the Vietnam War. News was received in March 1976 of the replacement of the unit's F-100D aircraft with A-7D Corsair II jets. The last Super Sabres left Joe Foss Field in June 1977. In 1979, the unit began a 12-year era of participation in Operation Coronet Cove at Howard AFB providing for defense of the Panama Canal. Both aircrew and support personnel were extended there in the summer of 1979 during the Nicaraguan crisis. The unit was awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Streamer for combat duty as a part of Operation Just Cause during 1989‚Äì1990. Tactical Air Command began retiring the A-7D in the late 1980s, with units being transitioned from the A-7D/K to the F-16C/D block 30. The first F-16 to arrive with the 175th Fighter Squadron was on 14 August 1991. In June 1993 the squadron deployed eight aircraft to Brustem AB, Belgium as Coronet DART for the European exercise Central Enterprise 1993. In December 1993 the squadron deployed again, this time for their first combat deployment with the F-16. Stationed at Incirlik AB, Turkey the squadron flew missions over Northern Iraq to guard the no-fly zone to protect Kurdish refugees. Combat patrol missions were flown over the northern \\"No Fly\\" zone of Iraq from December 1993 to January 1994. The 114th Fighter Group was re- designated as the 114th Fighter Wing in October 1995. The unit subsequently supported Operation Northern Watch, based out of Turkey in 1995 and 2002, and Operation Southern Watch based out of Kuwait in 1998 and Saudi Arabia in 2001. The Fighting Lobos were also deployed to Belgium, Singapore, the Netherlands Antilles and Israel. Global War on Terrorism 114th Fighter Wing F-16 at Balad AB, Iraq, 2010 A new chapter was opened in the history of the Air National Guard with the terrorist attacks on America on 11 September 2001. In addition to the unit's ongoing tasking as part of the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF), unit members were also activated to support Operation Noble Eagle within the United States and Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF). OIF deployments during the 2000s included three to Balad AB, Iraq (October‚ÄìDecember 2006; June‚ÄìSeptember 2008; January‚ÄìApril 2010. Unit members also deployed to the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Cyprus, Pakistan, Romania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Turkey, Spain, France and Germany. On 25 October 2005 an F-16 of the unit was attempting to take fuel from a KC-10 Extender, when the boom operator's accidental oscillation caused damages to both aircraft, which were able to land safely. The jet suffered more than $930,000 of damage, an unusual accident for a squadron that has enjoyed a tremendous safety record. In 2007, the squadron received the National Guard Bureau‚Äôs Winston P. Wilson Trophy, an annual award for the most outstanding Air National Guard unit. The squadron won the trophy again in 2010. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure committee recommended that the 175th Fighter Squadron retire its older block 30 F-16s and upgrade to the block 40. The first F-16C block 30 to depart was 'Cujo' aircraft (#85-1434), which occurred on 7 May 2010 with destination AMARG. Over the next five months they received block 40 vipers from all three squadrons at Hill AFB, Utah which were largely as a result of the closure of the 34th Fighter Squadron.

It ran from the current site of Corso Garibaldi in Naples to the royal palace at Portici, at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, now used by the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Naples Federico II. History The line was promoted by a Frenchman, Armand Bayard de la Vingtrie, who received a concession to build it in February 1837 from King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies. The concession authorised Bayard to build a railway from the current location of Napoli Centrale station outside the old walls of Naples along the Bay of Naples to Nocera Inferiore on the Sorrentine Peninsula, a distance of , with possible extensions to Salerno and Avellino, both through mountainous country. The line was built of wrought iron rails mounted on large cubic stone sunk into the ground (as the system of using wooden sleepers to distribute weights had not been invented) and gauge was maintained from time to time with transverse bars. Three locomotives were imported from Longridge and Co of England: two 2-2-2 locomotives for passenger traffic, named Bayard and Vesuvio, and one locomotive for goods traffic; rollingstock was built locally. The king opened the first of the line was from Naples to Portici on 3 October 1839. By the end of 1839 it had carried 131,116 passengers.

He invented the Super Soaker water gun in 1990, which has been among the world's bestselling toys ever since.  Early life and education  Johnson was born in Mobile, Alabama. His father was a World War II veteran and his mother worked as a nurse's aide. He stated that he had \\"liked to tinker with things\\" from an early age when his father explained to him the basic principles of electricity. In his teenage years, Johnson attended the all-black Williamson High School in Mobile. He drew much of his inspiration from George Washington Carver. In 1968, Johnson represented his high school in the Alabama science fair. He was the only black student in the fair at a time when African Americans did not have much presence in science. He created a robot he named \\"Linex\\", which was a compressed-air powered robot and took home first prize. After graduating from high school, Johnson attended Tuskegee University, obtaining a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in nuclear engineering. He also holds an honorary Ph.D. in Science from Tuskegee University. He then worked for the U.S. Air Force, and then joined NASA's jet propulsion laboratory in 1979. Career During his time at NASA, from 1979 to 1991, Johnson worked on a variety of projects, including the Air Force missions Lab, developing the nuclear power source for the Galileo mission to Jupiter, several weapons related projects, as well as an engineer on the Mariner Mark ll Spacecraft series for Comet Rendezvous and Saturn Orbiter Probe missions.\\" Johnson also worked on the stealth bomber program. In 1991, Johnson founded his own company, Johnson Research and Development Co., Inc., of which he is also the president. More recently, he teamed up with scientists from Tulane University and Tuskegee University to develop a method of transforming heat into electricity with the goal of making green energy more affordable. Johnson currently has two technology-development companies: Excellatron Solid State, LLC and Johnson Electro-Mechanical Systems (JEMS). They both currently operate in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood of Atlanta. Excellatron Solid State, LLC is a U.S. -based technology company that focuses on the development and production of solid state batteries, particularly thin film batteries. Its mission is stated as ‚Äú‚Ä¶to develop revolutionary energy storage technology as well as the manufacturing technology required for its cost effective commercialization.‚Äù The company's batteries boast safety, high temperature capability, long cycle life, thin flexible profiles, unique proprietary passivation barrier and packaging solution, and high rate capability. The company is targeting military applications and implantable medical devices as initial consumers. JEMS has developed the Johnson Thermo- Electrochemical Converter System (JTEC), listed by Popular Mechanics as one of the top 10 inventions of 2009. This system has potential applications in solar power plants and ocean thermal power generation. It converts thermal energy to electrical energy using a non-steam process which works by pushing hydrogen ions through two membranes, with claimed advantages over alternative systems. The companies operate a research laboratory in the Sweet Auburn neighborhood of Atlanta. Lonnie Johnson with US Representative Bradley Byrne in 2018. Johnson is a \\"part of a small group of African-American inventors whose work accounts for 6 percent of all U.S. patent applications.\\" Super Soaker Johnson conceived the Super Soaker while doing work with the U.S. Air Force. Initially it was called the ‚ÄúPower Drencher‚Äù when it appeared in toy shops in 1990, but after some tweaks and remarketing, it got its name. Selling between $10 to $60 depending on the model, the Super Soaker took off, generating $200 million in sales in 1991. Shortly after making the deal for the Super Soaker with the Larami Corporation, Larami became a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc. in February 1995. Johnson tweaked the design of the water gun, replacing the water in the Super Soaker with a \\"toy [Nerf] projectile.\\" In 1996, Johnson received for \\"Pneumatic launcher for a toy projectile and the like.\\" In February 2013, Johnson filed suit against Hasbro after he discovered that he was being underpaid royalties for the Super Soaker and several Nerf line of toys. In November 2013, Johnson was awarded nearly $73 million in royalties from Hasbro Inc. in arbitration. According to Hasbro, the Super Soaker is approaching sales of $1 billion.  Accolades  Johnson was awarded the Air Force Achievement Medal and the Air Force Commendation Medal. He received several awards from NASA for his work in spacecraft system design at the jet propulsion laboratory. In 2008, he was awarded the Breakthrough Award from science magazine Popular Mechanics for his work related to JTEC and was inducted into the State of Alabama Engineering Hall of Fame in 2011.

Boyd and performs research of nonequilibrium gases and plasmas involving the development of physical models for various gas systems of interest, numerical algorithms on the latest supercomputers, and the application of challenging flows for several exciting projects. The lab places a great deal of emphasis on comparison of simulation with external experimental and theoretical results, having ongoing collaborative studies with colleagues at the University of Michigan such as the Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion Laboratory, other universities, and government laboratories such as NASA, United States Air Force Research Laboratory, and the United States Department of Defense. Current research areas of the NGPDL include electric propulsion, hypersonic aerothermodynamics, flows involving very small length scales (MEMS devices), and materials processing (jets used in deposition thin films for advanced materials). Due to nonequilibrium effects, these flows cannot always be computed accurately with the macroscopic equations of gas dynamics and plasma physics. Instead, the lab has adopted a microscopic approach in which the atoms/molecules in a gas and the ions/electrons in a plasma are simulated on computationally using a large number of model particles within sophisticated Monte Carlo methods. The lab has developed a general 2D/axi-symmetric/3D code, MONACO, for simulating nonequilibrium neutral flows that can run either on scalar workstations or in a parallel computing environment. The lab also has developed a general 2D/axi- symmetric/3D code, LeMANS, to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations using computational fluid dynamics when the Knudsen number is sufficiently small. This allows lab members to explore flows that would otherwise be too computationally expensive with a particle method. Work is currently being done to combine the two codes into a hybrid that uses MONACO when the flow is in the collisional nonequilibrium regime and LeMANS when the flow can be considered continuous. Current and past plasma and nonequilibrium flow projects include simulation of ion thrusters, Hall effect thrusters, and pulsed plasma thrusters) as well as numerous NASA contracts to study reentry aerothermodynamics for space vehicles, including the Crew Exploration Vehicle.

History Origins of the clan The Scottish town of Stirling and Stirling Castle lie at the crossroads of Scotland and this could account for the derivation of the name which means place of strife. Appearing in a charter of David I of Scotland in around 1147 is Thoraldus who held the lands of Cadder. His descendant was Alexander de Strivelyn, fifth Laird of Cadder who died in 1304. Wars of Scottish Independence During the Wars of Scottish Independence Alexander's heir, Sir John de Strivelyn, was killed at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333. 15th and 16th centuries The grandson of Sir John de Strivelyn was Sir William who had two sons. The succession passed through his eldest son, also called William, for four generations. After this it passed to a grandson of the second son, Sir John de Strivelyn, third Laird of Cragernard. Sir John was the governor of the royal Dumbarton Castle and sheriff of Dumbartonshire. James I of Scotland appointed him as Comptroller of the Royal Household and armour bearer. He was knighted in 1430. His son, William, acquired from the Earl of Lennox the lands of Glorat. William also held Dumbarton Castle and this appointment passed to his son, George, who defended it for the Crown between 1534 and 1547. George fought at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh and died of wounds received there. In 1581 Malcom Kincaid of Clan Kincaid was killed by a Stirling of Glovat (Glorat).Way, George and Squire, Romily. Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). Published in 1994. Pages 186‚Äì187. 17th century and civil war George's great grandson was Sir Mungo Stirling of Glorat who was a staunch supporter of Charles I. In recognition of his bravery Charles knighted Sir Mungo. Sir Mungo's son was George Stirling who was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia in 1666. The Stirlings of Keir had acquired the lands of Keir in Perthshire in the mid 15th century when Prince James, son of James II of Scotland rebelled against his father and Sir William Stirling of Keir was one of his supporters. Sir William Stirling's descendant, Sir Archibald Stirling of Keir was a prominent lawyer who supported the king during the Scottish Civil War and on the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The Stirling of Garden branch of the clan descend from this Sir Archibald Stirling. He was also appointed to the Supreme Court with the title Lord Garden. His third son, James Stirling (1692 - 1770), was a prominent mathematician. 18th century and Jacobite risings During both the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Stirling Lairds of Keir fought for the Stuarts. James Stirling of Keir was tried for high treason after the \\"Gathering of Brig o' Turk\\" in support of James Stuart's abortive invasion of 1708, but acquitted. His estates were forfeited for his part in the rising of 1715 but they were later restored. Walter Stirling of Faskine served in the Royal Navy and was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet by George III of Great Britain. The Stirling of Faksine branch of the clan claimed descent from a nephew of William the Lion but they were in fact a collateral branch of the Stirlings of Cadder. James Stirling of Drumpellier fought in the war against America in 1812 and was later made Governor of Western Australia. Modern history The Stirling family's historic connection with Dumbarton Castle continued into the twentieth century when in 1927 Sir George Stirling of Glorat was appointed keeper of the castle. Stirling of Garden was Lord Lieutenant of Stirling and Falkirk (until 2005).

Founded on April Fool's Day, 1901, it is one of the oldest such publications in the United States. Printed continuously at least through 1997. It was revived in 2001 after a short lapse in publication and again in 2005 after another, shorter one. Jester now produces magazines and sponsors comedy events on Columbia's campus. Issues Excluding brief lapses in publication, the Jester has always produced issues. Jester publishes four or five times per year, with articles loosely centered around a broad theme. These have recently included \\"Justice,\\" \\"Liquid,\\" and \\"Technology.\\" Issues contain a wide array of articles and jokes, such as narratives, dialogues, and articles composed of short paragraphs discussing a theme. To heighten the effect of period pieces or specific jokes, articles appear as fake documents found and scanned into the issue. Illustrations are a significant part of the magazine, with visual gags and fake ads bringing greater variety. Jester attempts to not repeat jokes or features, except for a letters to the editor section, an editorial, called the \\"Editaurus,\\" an obituary section succinctly named \\"Deaths,\\" and a couple of \\"list\\" pages containing short jokes and lists. However, there are no recurring subjects, and news-style pieces rarely appear, except as \\"sampled\\" documents. Within individual issues, there are also recurring references, including ones regarding Picabo Street, the Zune, and Q-Zar. Other activities In addition to publishing the magazine, the group puts on comedy events, containing sketches, improv comedy, and an event reminiscent of the antics of Andy Kaufmann, where an audience was forced to watch other students eat dinner for 30 minutes while listening to madrigals. Jester also performs a number of pranks, most recently establishing a pseudo-rivalry with the Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal, culminating in a staged theft of issues, attached rebuttals, and a parody website. The Columbia Spectator reported the event as an actual disappearance.

He was the great-great-grandfather of the distinguished statesman Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston. His descendants in the female line include the famous poet Lord Byron. Biography Temple was born in London on 25 March 1632.Edward J. Davies, \\"The Ancestry of Lord Palmerston\\", The Genealogist, 22(2008):62-77. He was a son of Sir John Temple and his wife Mary Hammond, daughter of Dr. John Hammond, of Chertsey, Surrey. He waa the brother of Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet, the distinguished diplomat and friend of Jonathan Swift. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford where he was awarded BA in 1649 and was admitted to Lincoln's Inn on 4 May 1650. He was awarded MA at Cambridge University in 1652 and was called to the bar in 1657. In July 1660, he was appointed Solicitor General for Ireland, and in May 1661, he was elected to the Irish House of Commons as member for Carlow Borough; in September, he became the Speaker of Parliament in Ireland. On the death of King Charles II in 1685, Temple, although a staunch Protestant was happy to continue in office under the Roman Catholic James II,Ridley, Jasper Lord Palmerston Constable and Co 1970 p.3 and so remained until the Jacobite takeover of 1689, which involved the exclusion of all Protestant office holders in Ireland; at which time he fled to England, and had his estates confiscated by the Patriot Parliament.Dictionary of National Biography He was knighted on 15 August 1663. On his return to Ireland in 1691 he was granted title to some 12,000 acres in County Sligo; these lands were confiscated from the native Irish.Ridley p.3 After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 had ended with the defeat of the Jacobite forces in 1691, he returned to Ireland, and served as Attorney General for Ireland until May 1695.

Family Temple married Jane Yarner (died 1708), daughter of Sir Abraham Yarner (died 1677), the Muster-master for Ireland, in 1663 and had numerous children with her, of whom at least six reached adulthood. The eldest surviving son, Henry (c.1673‚Äì1757) became the first Viscount Palmerston. The younger son John, of Dublin, married his cousin Elizabeth Temple, but had no children. Temple also had four surviving daughters: *Jane Martha (1672-1751) who married firstly John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton, and secondly William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland, and had issue by her second marriage.

It may also be called static pressure head or simply static head (but not static head pressure). Mathematically this is expressed as: :\\\\psi = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\gamma} = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho \\\\, g} where :\\\\psi is pressure head (which is actually a length, typically in units of meters or centimetres of water) :p is fluid pressure (i.e. force per unit area, typically expressed in pascals) :\\\\gamma is the specific weight (i.e. force per unit volume, typically expressed in N/m3 units) :\\\\rho is the density of the fluid (i.e. mass per unit volume, typically expressed in kg/m3) :g is acceleration due to gravity (i.e. rate of change of velocity, expressed in m/s2). Note that in this equation, the pressure term may be gauge pressure or absolute pressure, depending on the design of the container and whether it is open to the ambient air or sealed without air. Head equation Pressure head is a component of hydraulic head, in which it is combined with elevation head. When considering dynamic (flowing) systems, there is a third term needed: velocity head. Thus, the three terms of velocity head, elevation head, and pressure head appear in the head equation derived from the Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids: :h_{v} + z_\\\\text{elevation} + \\\\psi = C\\\\, where :h_{v} is velocity head, :z_\\\\text{elevation} is elevation head, :\\\\psi is pressure head, and :C is a constant for the system Practical uses for pressure head A Venturi meter with two pressure instruments open to the ambient air. (p>0 and g>0) If the meter is turned upside down, we say by convention that g<0 and the fluid inside the vertical columns will pour out the two holes. See discussion below. Fluid flow is measured with a wide variety of instruments. The venturi meter in the diagram on the left shows two columns of a measurement fluid at different heights. The height of each column of fluid is proportional to the pressure of the fluid. To demonstrate a classical measurement of pressure head, we could hypothetically replace the working fluid with another fluid having different physical properties. For example, if the original fluid was water and we replaced it with mercury at the same pressure, we would expect to see a rather different value for pressure head. In fact the specific weight of water is 9.8 kN/m3 and the specific weight of mercury is 133 kN/m3. So, for any particular measurement of pressure head, the height of a column of water will be about [133/9.8 = 13.6] 13.6 times taller than a column of mercury would be. So if a water column meter reads \\"13.6 cm H2O\\", then an equivalent measurement is \\"1.00 cm Hg\\". This example demonstrates why there is some confusion surrounding pressure head and its relationship to pressure. Scientists frequently use columns of water (or mercury) to measure pressure (manometric pressure measurement), since for a given fluid, pressure head is proportional to pressure. Measuring pressure in units of \\"mm of mercury\\" or \\"inches of water\\" makes sense for instrumentation, but these raw measurements of head must frequently be converted to more convenient pressure units using the equations above to solve for pressure. In summary pressure head is a measurement of length, which can be converted to the units of pressure (force per unit area), as long as strict attention is paid to the density of the measurement fluid and the local value of g. Implications for gravitational anomalies on \\\\psi\\\\, We would normally use pressure head calculations in areas in which g is constant. However, if the gravitational field fluctuates, we can prove that pressure head fluctuates with it. * If we consider what would happen if gravity decreases, we would expect the fluid in the venturi meter shown above to withdraw from the pipe up into the vertical columns. Pressure head is increased. * In the case of weightlessness, the pressure head approaches infinity. Fluid in the pipe may \\"leak out\\" of the top of the vertical columns (assuming p>0). * To simulate negative gravity, we could turn the venturi meter shown above upside down. In this case gravity is negative, and we would expect the fluid in the pipe to \\"pour out\\" the vertical columns. Pressure head is negative (assuming p>0). * If p<0 and g>0, we observe that the pressure head is also negative, and the ambient air is sucked into the columns shown in the venturi meter above. This is called a siphon, and is caused by a partial vacuum inside the vertical columns. In many venturis, the column on the left has fluid in it (\\\\psi>0), while only the column on the right is a siphon (\\\\psi<0). * If p<0 and g<0, we observe that the pressure head is again positive, predicting that the venturi meter shown above would look the same, only upside down. In this situation, gravity causes the working fluid to plug the siphon holes, but the fluid does not leak out because the ambient pressure is greater than the pressure in the pipe. * The above situations imply that the Bernoulli equation, from which we obtain static pressure head, is extremely versatile. Applications Static A mercury barometer is one of the classic uses of static pressure head. Such barometers are an enclosed column of mercury standing vertically with gradations on the tube. The lower end of the tube is bathed in a pool of mercury open to the ambient to measure the local atmospheric pressure. The reading of a mercury barometer (in mm of Hg, for example) can be converted into an absolute pressure using the above equations. If we had a column of mercury 767 mm high, we could calculate the atmospheric pressure as (767 mm)‚Ä¢(133 kN/m¬≥) = 102 kPa. See the torr, millimeter of mercury, and pascal (unit) articles for barometric pressure measurements at standard conditions. Differential A flow of air through a venturi meter, showing the columns connected in a U-shape (a manometer) and partially filled with water. The meter is \\"read\\" as a differential pressure head in centimeters or inches of water. The venturi meter and manometer is a common type of flow meter which can be used in many fluid applications to convert differential pressure heads into volumetric flow rate, linear fluid speed, or mass flow rate using Bernoulli's principle. The reading of these meters (in inches of water, for example) can be converted into a differential, or gauge pressure, using the above equations. Velocity head The pressure of a fluid is different when it flows than when it is not flowing. This is why static pressure and dynamic pressure are never the same in a system in which the fluid is in motion. This pressure difference arises from a change in fluid velocity that produces velocity head, which is a term of the Bernoulli equation that is zero when there is no bulk motion of the fluid. In the picture on the right, the pressure differential is entirely due to the change in velocity head of the fluid, but it can be measured as a pressure head because of the Bernoulli principle. If, on the other hand, we could measure the velocity of the fluid, the pressure head could be calculated from the velocity head. See the Derivations of Bernoulli equation.

Eight people win the Thumbs Up contest which gives them an opportunity to tour Europe. Uma (Soundarya) is one of the contest winners. Abhiram likes Uma and acts as their tour companion during their stay in Europe. A shy Uma could not express her love towards him, so she leaves a message in his answering machine. But Abhiram could not listen to the message at the right time. Hence, Uma presumes that Abhiram does not love her and goes back to India with her companions. Abhiram, who happened to listen to the message after Uma left, calls up Uma and makes contact with her. But it's too late for him, as Uma's father arranges his daughter's marriage with Jasjit, the brother of the main villain. Meanwhile, Jasjit and his gang of goons are searching for a persona named Mahadeva Naidu.

The book covers Moody's life from childhood through her mid twenties, including her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement beginning when she was a student at the historically black Tougaloo College. Moody's autobiography details her struggles both against racism among white people and sexism among her fellow civil rights activists. It received many positive reviews and won awards from the National Library Association and the National Council of Christians and Jews. About the author Anne Moody, born Essie Mae Moody, was born September 15, 1940, just outside Centreville, Mississippi. The daughter of two poor sharecroppers and the eldest of many, Moody took on a great responsibility at a young age and matured quickly. After graduating high school in 1959, Moody received a basketball scholarship to Natchez Junior College and later transferred to Tougaloo College. Moody became involved early in the Civil Rights Movement, helping organize the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and participating in a Woolworth's sit-in on May 28, 1963. After graduation from Tougaloo College, Moody moved to Ithaca, New York, where she was a project coordinator for Cornell University until 1965. She moved to New York City once she left Cornell, where she began writing Coming of Age in Mississippi, which was published in 1968. She married Austin Straus, with whom she had one son, Sascha Straus. After struggling with dementia for years, she died at her home in Gloster, Mississippi, on February 5, 2015, aged 74.  Structure and content  Coming of Age in Mississippi is divided into four sections: \\"Childhood\\", \\"High School\\", \\"College\\", and \\"The Movement\\". Part One: Childhood Moody begins her story on the plantation where she lives with her mother, Toosweet, and her father, Diddly, both sharecroppers, and her younger sister, Adline. Later, Moody's mother gives birth to her third child, Jr. While Toosweet is pregnant with Jr., her father begins an affair with another woman from the plantation. Shortly after Jr.‚Äôs birth, her parents separate. Moody moves with her mother and younger siblings to town to live with her great aunt and begins grade school. Moody's curiosity about race is sparked when her questions about her two uncles, who appear white, go unanswered. Moody's mother begins a relationship with a man named Raymond, whom she eventually marries and has five more children with by the time Moody is in college. At nine years old, Moody begins her first job sweeping a porch, earning seventy-five cents a week and two gallons of milk. She experiences her first real competition with Raymond‚Äôs sister Darlene; they're the same age and in the same class, constantly competing against one another whenever possible. Though Moody enjoys attending Centreville church, which Raymond's family belongs to, she is tricked into joining her mother's church: Mt. Pleasant. She resents her mother for some time after that. Once the family farm falls through, Moody takes on more responsibility to help support the family. When asked to obtain a copy of her birth certificate for graduation, her birth certificate shows up as Annie Mae. When Toosweet requests to have it changed, she is told there would be a fee; Moody asks if she can keep Annie, and so she becomes Annie Mae Moody. Part Two: High School Moody's political awakenings begin during her teenage years, chronicled in the book's second section, \\"High School.\\" During her first year in high school, Emmett Till, an innocent 14-year-old black boy visiting Mississippi from Chicago, is tortured and murdered for allegedly whistling in a flirtatious and offensive manner at a white woman. His murder is a defining moment in Moody's life. When Moody asks her mother questions about why the boy was killed and by whom, she is told, \\"an Evil Spirit killed him;\\" and that \\"it would take eight years to learn what that spirit was.\\" For the first time, she realizes the extent to which many whites in Mississippi will go to protect their way of life - white supremacy - and the appalling powerlessness of the blacks - what most whites considered savages. When she asks her mother for the meaning of \\"NAACP\\" (referring to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), after hearing it from Mrs. Burke, the white woman she works for, her mother tells her never to mention that word in front of any white person, and, if possible, not at all. Shortly thereafter, Moody discovers that there is one adult in her life who could offer her the answers she seeks: Mrs. Rice, her homeroom teacher. Mrs. Rice plays a pivotal role in Moody's maturation. She not only answers Moody's questions about Emmett Till and the NAACP, but she volunteers a great deal more information about the state of race relations in Mississippi. Moody's early curiosity about the NAACP resurfaces later when she attends Tougaloo College. It is during this time, at fifteen years old, that Moody makes the claim that she began to hate white people. She also moves to Baton Rouge that same summer. While in Baton Rouge, Moody learns some tough lessons when she is ripped off by a white family for two weeks' pay, and when she is betrayed by a co-worker, which resulted in her losing her job. Working for Mrs. Burke was something Moody viewed as a challenge; one that she overcame when she quit after Mrs. Burke wrongfully accused her younger brother, Jr. When Moody returned to New Orleans the following summer she worked as a waitress and was able to save money for college. Moody graduated high school in the summer of 1959 and made the decision to return to New Orleans for good. Part Three: College The third section of the autobiography reveals Moody's increasing commitment to political activism. Towards the end of the summer after graduation, Moody received a letter from the head coach at Natchez Junior College; she had received a basketball scholarship. Attending Natchez felt very restrictive to Moody, and at the end of the year she was unsure if she would return, but because of the cost of the schools in New Orleans, she returned to Natchez in the fall. During her second year at Natchez College, she helps organize a successful boycott of the campus cafeteria when a student finds a maggot in her plate of grits. This is Moody's first experience in organizing a group of individuals to launch a structured revolt against the practices of an established institution. While waiting for their demands to be met, Moody offers up what little money she has to help buy food for her fellow students. Just before the end of her sophomore year at Natchez, Moody successfully for an academic scholarship to Tougaloo College. When Moody's roommate Trotter encourages her to join the NAACP, of which she is the secretary, Moody promises she will attend the next meeting, despite the animosity and violence that had surrounded everything she knew about the group. Some Tougaloo students were jailed after a demonstration, and when they were brought back to campus, Medgar Evers accompanied them to \\"get some of Tougaloo‚Äôs spirit and try and spread it around all over Jackson.\\" Though Moody's grades suffered, she could not pull herself away from the movement. A white student, Joan Trumpauer, a secretary for SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, moved across the hall from Moody and invited her to help canvas in the voter registration they were organizing in the Delta. While a junior at Tougaloo College, Moody joins the NAACP. The third section ends with Moody's recounting of a terrifying ordeal in Jackson, Mississippi. On a shopping trip there with Rose, a fellow student from Tougaloo College, Moody ‚Äì without any planning or support mechanism in place ‚Äì decides to go into the \\"Whites Only\\" section of the Trailways bus depot. Initially the whites in the waiting area react with shock, but soon a menacing white mob gathers around the two young women and threatens violence. Part Four: The Movement The fourth and final section documents Moody's full-scale involvement in the struggle for civil rights. In the opening chapter of the final section, Moody narrates her participation in a sit-in at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Jackson. She and three other civil rights workers ‚Äì two of them white ‚Äì take their seats at the lunch counter. They are denied service, but the four continue to sit and wait. Soon a large number of white students from a local high school pour into Woolworth‚Äôs. When the students realize that a sit-in is in progress, they crowd around Moody and her companions and begin to taunt them. The verbal abuse quickly turns physical. Moody, along with the other three, is beaten, kicked, and \\"dragged about thirty feet toward the door by [her] hair\\" (266). Then all four of them are \\"smeared with ketchup, mustard, sugar, pies and everything on the counter\\" (266). The abuse continues for almost three hours until Dr. Beittel, the president of Tougaloo College who arrived after being informed of the violence, rescues them. When Moody is escorted out of Woolworth's by Dr. Beittel, she realizes that \\"about ninety white police officers had been standing outside the store; they had been watching the whole thing through the windows, but had not come in to stop the mob or do anything\\" (267). This experience helps Moody understand \\"how sick Mississippi whites were\\" and how \\"their disease, an incurable disease,\\" could prompt them even to kill to preserve \\"the segregated Southern way of life\\" (267). While Moody is working for CORE, she slowly becomes angry; angry that she is not seeing the change she had hoped for, in the time she had hoped for, and angry that so many black people refused to work as diligently as herself and her activist peers did. Moody experiences the most fear throughout the entire story during this time when she learns she has made the Klan list. In the chapters that follow she comments on the impact of the assassinations of Medgar Evers and President John F. Kennedy on the Civil Rights Movement, and the escalating turmoil across the South. Just before the final chapter, along with her fellow \\"Woolworth orphans,\\" Moody graduates from Tougaloo College. The short final chapter ends with her joining a busload of civil rights workers on their way to Washington, D.C. As the bus moves through the Mississippi landscape, her fellow travelers sing the anthem of the Movement.

The Oxford English Dictionary gives a reference from the year 1542 of the four sorts of cheese. The first sort is green cheese, which is not green by reason of colour but for its newness or under-ripened state, for the whey is not half pressed out of it yet. The phrase is not commonly used to describe the colour of a cheese, though there are some cheeses with a greenish tint, usually from mold or added herbs. There are other instances in which the word \\"green\\" is used to mean \\"new\\", such as in the term \\"greenhorn\\", which refers to an inexperienced person. In popular culture The phrase the Moon is made of green cheese refers to the similarity in appearance of a typical round, green cheese and the full Moon. It is commonly misinterpreted to mean that the Moon is green in colour, which isn't the case. (The surface of the Moon is quite dark and could be described as having the color of old, weathered black asphalt.) John Maynard Keynes made a reference comparing a green cheese to the moon in his 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. The exact meaning of the sentence is debated, but the equating of the moon with a green cheese is clear.: There is a popular saying in Scotland, \\"You can't see green cheese go past you\\", This means that you must have whatever someone else has just for the sake of having it. For example, a child's friend may get a bike and although the child is unable to ride a bike, they will pester their parents to buy one. The following West Frisian language shibboleth makes reference to it: \\"B√ªter en brea en griene tsiis, hwa't dat net sizze kin is gjin oprjuchte Frys.\\" meaning \\"Butter and bread and green cheese, who can't say that is no true Frisian.\\"The History of English: A Linguistic Introduction. Scott Shay, Wardja Press, 2008, ,  Cheeses that are green in colour  The veins of most blue cheese are in fact a dark bluish-green. There are several varieties of cheese which are actually green or pale green in colour. Green cheese varieties include: *Cherni Vit - Green cheese from Bulgaria *Sage Derby cheese *Schabziger - Swiss green cheese Other cheeses exist which are wholly or partly green in colour due to the addition of herbs.

After a devastating loss to the army of the Hrum, Farsala has all but fallen. Only the walled city of Mazad and a few of the more uninhabitable regions remain free of Hrum rule, and they seem destined to fall as well. Farsala needs a champion now. Soraya risks being a slave herself to save her little brother and her mother, who are currently in the Hrum slave pens. Kavi has second thoughts about helping the Hrum and switches sides. But Jiaan and Soraya still hate Kavi for his betrayal of Farsala and are furious when the three are re-united.

When he is sent to the wizards to take the wizard test, he hopes to fail. Instead, he finds he has a gift for magic. Dayven refuses to acknowledge his power and later his cousin Soren tells him that the Lordowner, Lord Enar, wants to see him. Lord Enar asks what he thinks about wizards and Dayven says how much he hates them. Lord Enar agrees about Dayven's opinion of wizards and asks if he wants to spy on the wizards and Dayven agrees. One of the wizards, Sundar, gives Dayven money to bail a wizard, Reddick, out of jail. Reddick wants Dayven to go with him to spy on the Cenzar. On their journey they come across a dry stream and after some investigation help the villagers solve the problem. As the journey continues they reach the city of the Cenzar. In the city Reddick takes Dayven to the zondar, or training school for soldiers. As he becomes entrenched in the war, Dayven comes to a discomforting realization that there is no just two sides to a battle, just as there is not just black or white. He befriends a boy on the other side of the war, and during the war, he works as a healer in the surgeon's tent. In the end, when he sees his friend hurt, he heals him, at the cost of losing everything he had dreamed to be. Dayven realizes the flaws of his people. The Cenzar used to only farm three fields out of four at a time. This way the land had a full year to regain its minerals and nutrients. When the Cenzar lost their land this rule was viewed as laziness and ignored. If Dayven's people continue to have their way, they will make the land infertile and then move to somewhere new as they have done countless times before. Dayven uses spells to make sure that the Cenzar win the battle. He stays behind when his people are forced to move on.

It lies off the A14 between Cambridge towards Huntingdon, via a lane that provides the only traffic access to and from the village. The Prime Meridian passes through the village, around just to the west of the crossroads in the centre. History Lolworth is a small village and parish, covering only . It owes its position to the Via Devana, the Roman road running from Cambridge to Huntingdon that became a turnpike between 1772 and 1876. In the early Middle Ages the village was well populated for its size, with 154 adults registered for the poll tax of 1377. However, the population declined sharply after that, perhaps due to a devastating fire caused by a thunderstorm of September 1393.Recorded by Thomas of Walsingham, a monk of St Albans, in his Historica Anglicana By 1524 there were only 17 taxpayers, and the 17 families comprising 90 people listed in 1728 occupied only six buildings. The population reached a peak of 170 in 1871, and has been relatively steady at around 130 since 1961. The celebrated 19th-century missionary Henry Martyn served in Lolworth, which was his first parish from 1803 to 1805 while he was a curate under Charles Simeon at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge, before setting out for India and present-day Iran and Turkey. Listed as Lollesworthe in 1034 and Lolesuuorde in the Domesday Book, the village's name means \\"Enclosure of a man called Loll\\". Church All Saints' Church There has been a church on the site since at least the 13th century, but the present church probably dates from just prior to its rededication in 1406, with the tower added later. This leads to the theory that the great fire of 1393 destroyed the existing church, as little that pre- dates the fire survives. Dedicated to All Saints, the building comprises a chancel, a nave with south porch, and a three-storey west tower. Village life The village is too small to warrant amenities other than its church. In 1960, a local resident, T. B. Robinson, bought the former school from the county council and gave it for use as a village hall, which was then named after him. Lolworth has no public house, but did have one alehouse, The Three Horseshoes, between the 1760s and 1798. It also had a small post office run from the front of a resident's house, but this closed in the early 21st century. Lolworth borders Bar Hill to the south, which is accessible by a path through the field. To the north lies Swavesey, where most of the children go to their secondary school. Boxworth is to the west of the village and Childerley to the south.

In common with many other diterpenoid alkaloids, it is toxic to animals, although the acute toxicity varies with species. Early research was focused on identifying, and characterizing the properties of methyllycaconitine as one of the principal toxins in larkspurs responsible for livestock poisoning in the mountain rangelands of North America. Methyllycaconitine has been explored as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of spastic paralyses in man, and it has been shown to have insecticidal properties. Most recently, it has become an important molecular probe for studying the pharmacology of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Isolation The first isolation of MLA, from Delphinium brownii, Rydb., was probably made by Richard Manske at the National Research Laboratories in Ottawa, Canada, in 1938. Presumably because he did not obtain the compound in sufficiently pure form, Manske declined to give it a name. The name \\"methyl- lycaconitine\\" was assigned by John Goodson, working at the Wellcome Chemical Research Laboratories in London, England, when he isolated the alkaloid, in purer form, from seeds of Delphinium elatum, L. in 1943. A more modern isolation procedure is described by Pelletier and his co-workers, who used seeds of the \\"garden larkspur\\", Consolida ambigua (also referred to as Delphinium ajacis) as their plant source. Structure determination The complete molecular structure for MLA, correct in all but one detail, was first published by Kuzovkov and Platonova in 1959. This structure, supported in part by X-ray crystallography (considered usually to be a \\"definitive\\" analytical technique) of a chemical derivative of MLA performed by Maria Przybylska, was accepted as correct until the early 1980s. At that time, the research groups of Pelletier and of Edwards and Przybylska independently corrected the stereochemistry of the methoxy group at C-1 from the Œ≤- to Œ±- configuration. Thus any drawing of MLA appearing before Pelletier's 1981 paper will show the structure with the incorrect stereochemistry at C-1. Chemistry Synonyms [1Œ±,4(S),6Œ≤,14Œ±,16Œ≤]-20-Ethyl-1,6,14,16-tetramethoxy-4- [2-(3-methyl-2,5-dioxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)benzoyl]oxy]methyl]aconitane-7,8-diol; also referred to, incorrectly, as \\"N-methyl lycaconitine\\" in a few publications. Physico-chemical properties MLA is soluble in chloroform, but does not dissolve well in water. The free base of MLA has not been obtained in crystalline form, and in its amorphous form it melts ultimately at 128 ¬∞C; the hydriodide salt has a melting point of 201 ¬∞C.; the perchlorate salt melts at 195 ¬∞C The citrate salt is the most common form in which MLA is currently available commercially.No citation is given here because the information is date-specific, and because it is inappropriate to endorse any particular supplier. A pKa does not seem to have been recorded for MLA, but it is considered to be a weak base because it can be readily extracted into diethyl ether from an aqueous solution at pH 7.5-8. The optical rotation of the free base, [Œ±]D was found to be +49¬∞ in alcohol. Molecular structure Although commonly referred to as a \\"diterpenoid\\" alkaloid, MLA is, strictly speaking, a nor-diterpenoid, since its carbon skeleton only contains 19 C atoms, one having been deleted somewhere during its biosynthesis.The biosynthetic pathway by which MLA is created in the plant is still not known in any great detail. Otherwise, the MLA molecule comprises a tertiary amine, two tertiary alcohols, four methyl ether groups, and a complex ester based on anthranilic acid and methylsuccinic acid. This N-(2-carboxyphenyl)-methylsuccinamido-ester is quite rare amongst natural products. Synthesis As of April, 2012 no total synthesis of MLA has been reported. A semi-synthesis of MLA, starting from its \\"parent\\" amino-alcohol, lycoctonine (obtained by simple alkaline hydrolysis of natural MLA ) was reported in 1994.  Pharmacology In many respects, the pharmacology of MLA closely resembles that of the classical neuromuscular blocker, d-tubocurarine. The \\"curare-like\\" properties of MLA seem to have been first mentioned in 1958 by Kuzovkov and Bocharnikova, working at the Ordzhinikidze All-Union Institute for Scientific Research in Pharmaceutical Chemistry, in the former USSR. A detailed paper on the pharmacology of MLA (in the form of its hydriodide salt, given the drug name \\"mellictine\\") in classical animal preparations was published from the same Institute in the following year by Dozortseva. These studies, together with related others and some original observations, are summarized in the review by Benn and Jacyno. They revealed that MLA blocked neuromuscular transmission in skeletal muscle, but not smooth muscle, and had some ganglion-blocking action. Such properties are characteristic of an antagonist of acetylcholine exerting its effects at nicotinic, but not muscarinic sites. In the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation, for example, a 2 x 10‚àí5M concentration of MLA produced a 50% decrease in response, and total inhibition was caused by a 3 x 10‚àí5M concentration of the drug. In this preparation, MLA-treated muscle responded normally to direct electrical stimulation, but the inhibition of contractions was only partially antagonized by physostigmine. Similar results were obtained with frog nerve-muscle preparations, in which it was shown that MLA blocked response of the gastrocnemius muscle to electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve, inhibited post-synaptic action potentials in the sartorius muscle elicited by stimulation of the sciatic nerve, and reduced the amplitude of miniature end- plate potentials in the extensor digitus IV muscle. Ganglion-blocking effects of MLA were observed using the cat nictitating membrane preparation: complete inhibition of the response was produced by 4 mg/kg of \\"mellictine\\" given intravenously. No significant effects were produced by the drug in smooth muscle preparations from rabbit, guinea pig or cat, indicating the lack of activity at typically muscarinic sites. In electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum, for example, contractions were unaffected by a concentration of 5 x 10‚àí4M of MLA. A more detailed summary of the above data, together with much related material, may be found in a review written by Kip Panter and collaborators at USDA-ARS laboratories in Utah and California. A significant advance was made towards understanding the pharmacology of MLA when Jennings and co-workers at the American Cyanamid Company reported that MLA (as its citrate salt) strongly inhibited the binding of tritiated propionyl-Œ±- bungarotoxin to a receptor preparation from house-fly heads, with a Ki of ~ 2.5 x 10‚àí10M. Subsequently, Macallan and his co-workers showed that MLA also competed with 125I-Œ±-bungarotoxin (Ki ~1 x 10‚àí9M) and tritiated (‚àí)-nicotine (Ki ~4 x 10‚àí6M) in a receptor preparation from rat brain. These workers also reported that MLA displaced125I-Œ±-bungarotoxin from purified Torpedo (electric ray) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with a Ki ~1 x 10‚àí6M. Similar experiments performed later by Ward et al. showed that MLA bound to nAChRs extracted from human muscle with a Ki of ~8 x 10‚àí6M; it was also reported that MLA, at a concentration of 10‚àí4M, had no affinity for muscarinic AChRs, as labeled by tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate, from rat brain. Further details about the binding of MLA to nAChRs were presented by Wonnacott and her co- workers, who provided evidence that MLA bound preferentially to different sub- units, as expressed in Xenopus frog oocytes, of the nAChR cloned from avian DNA: MLA was found to have an IC50 of ~8 x 10‚àí8M at Œ±3Œ≤2 and ~7 x 10‚àí7M at Œ±4Œ≤2 receptor sub-types. Although it was also established that MLA bound strongly to Œ±7 sub-types, experimental difficulties precluded the determination of an IC50. Subsequently, research groups from Abbott Laboratories in the USA, and the University of Geneva in Switzerland reported that MLA displaced 125I-Œ±-bungarotoxin from Œ±7 receptors cloned from the human K28 cell line, with a Ki of ~ 1 x 10‚àí8. One last milestone in the ongoing saga of MLA pharmacology (there are, as of April 2012, approximately 660 references to articles in journals covered by PubMed) to be mentioned is the characterization of the receptor-interactions of tritium-labeled MLA, by researchers at the University of Bath, in the UK. One relatively recent study which sheds light on the interaction of MLA with acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBP) at the molecular level is that of Hansen et al.,PDB entry . who made observations on the crystal structure of a complex between MLA and an AChBP isolated from the salt-water snail, Aplysia californica.  Toxicology  The toxicology of MLA has been studied largely in the context of livestock poisoning by wild larkspurs. The seminal work by John Jacyno and Mike Benn at the University of Calgary in Canada showed that MLA was most likely to be the agent responsible for the toxicity of a local larkspur, D. brownii, and provided some preliminary acute toxicity data in several animal species. These LD50s are as follows: mouse, 3‚Äì5 mg/kg; frog, 3‚Äì4 mg/kg; rabbit, 2‚Äì3 mg/kg (after parenteral administration). Cats appeared to have comparable susceptibility to rabbits, whereas dogs were ~ 1.5 x more sensitive. These early observations have been comprehensively extended by USDA researchers, who have estimated the LD50 of MLA to be ~10 mg/kg in sheep, ~ 5 mg/kg in rats, and ~2 mg/kg in cattle. Although most LD50s are usually determined from parenteral administration of the test drug, MLA is also active when taken orally. Signs of toxicity in calves, sheep, rats and mice, at low doses, included agitation, respiratory difficulty, and loss of motor control; symptoms appeared within 2‚Äì3 minutes of injection, and disappeared within 10 minutes. Doses large enough to produce collapse also caused an increase in heart and respiration rates, as well as tremor, with significant convulsions evident in mice and rats, but not in cattle or sheep. In cases where death seemed imminent, the poisoning in sheep could be counteracted by the i.v. administration of neostigmine and atropine, whereas poisoning in calves was reversed by the administration of physostigmine. In animals that were allowed to die, death appeared to be the result of complete motor paralysis and respiratory arrest. It is worth noting that although a LD50 for man is not available, the clinical studies of Kabelyanskaya showed that an oral dose of 0.02 g of MLA hydriodide (\\"mellictine\\") might be given to patients up to 5 times per day, over the course of 1 month. However, some subjects could only tolerate single doses of 0.02 g per day without experiencing side-effects. Structure-Activity relationships The earliest observation on a relationship between the molecular structure of MLA and a biological activity concerned the effect of the C-18 ester group on acute toxicity. When this group was hydrolyzed, the resulting amino-alcohol (named lycoctonine as a consequence of its natural occurrence) was found to be much less poisonous to animals than was MLA. A recent study comparing the LD50 of MLA and lycoctonine, given i.v. to mice, showed that lycoctonine was more than 100x less toxic than MLA. In other functional pharmacological assays, lycoctonine resembled MLA qualitatively but was roughly ten times less potent. When compared in nAChR-binding studies, MLA was found to compete for 125I-Œ±- bungarotoxin binding sites (i.e. Œ±7 sub-types) over 1000x more strongly than did lycoctonine. If the succinimide ring is deleted so as to leave only the -NH2 group attached to the benzene ring (as in the alkaloid anthranoyllycoctonine, which also occurs naturally), the resulting compound is intermediate between MLA and lycoctonine in potency and toxicity: it is less acutely toxic than MLA by a factor of about 4, but its affinity for 125I-Œ±- bungarotoxin binding sites is over 200x lower than that of MLA. If the -NH2 group of anthranoyllycoctonine is removed, giving the compound lycoctonine-18-O-benzoate, the affinity for Œ±7 receptors, as well as for Œ±4Œ≤2 receptors is reduced by about a factor of 10 in comparison to MLA. When compared with MLA in the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm assay, lycoctonine-18-O-benzoate was also about 10x less potent, and a similar reduction in potency was observed in an electrophysiological study involving frog extensor muscle. Even the absence of the methyl group from the methylsuccinimido- ring, as in the alkaloid lycaconitine, reduces the affinity for Œ±7 receptors by a factor of about 20,> but in this case affinity for Œ±4Œ≤2 receptors is not significantly changed in comparison with MLA. Another approach that has been explored in the attempt to elucidate structure-activity relationships in MLA has been to start with 2-(methylsuccinimido)-benzoic acid (the carboxylic acid produced when MLA is split at the C-18 ester group) and to esterify it with various alcohols and amino-alcohols that might be considered as \\"molecular fragments\\" of MLA. None of these compounds showed any significant degree of the biological actions characteristic of MLA, however, in the limited number of assays to which they were subjected. Therapeutic applications MLA has been used for treating a variety of neurological disorders, although there are no references to such use in the last few decades. More recently, it has been proposed that MLA might be useful in reducing nicotine reward without precipitating symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. This suggestion was made on the basis of experiments in which intraperitoneal doses of ~4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg of MLA significantly reduced nicotine self-administration in rats. Most recently, it has been suggested that MLA had potential in the treatment of cannabis dependence. However, this suggestion was apparently based only on work by Solinas et al. who showed that doses of 0.3-5.6 mg/kg, i.p., in rats, dose-dependently antagonized the discriminative-stimulus effects of 3 mg/kg THC. Given that the early Soviet work with \\"mellictine\\" indicated that as little as ~0.2-0.3 mg/kg, orally, in man (assuming a weight of 60‚Äì70 kg, for the sake of making the dose conversion) could produce symptoms of toxicity, and that oral administration of most drugs typically requires more drug than parenteral administration, it is uncertain if MLA will prove to be a practical treatment for either nicotine or cannabis addiction, based on the effective doses required in the rat experiments. In a recent review, Wu and co-workers have cited research in which Œ±7-antagonists such as MLA show potential in cancer treatment, but this work is still in its very early stages. Insecticidal action Jennings and co-workers, in addition to making their key observations (see Pharmacology above) about the receptor-binding of MLA, found it to be toxic (50+% mortality) to the following insect species: Empoasca abruptaThe western potato leafhopper. (at 100 ppm), Heliothis virescens (at 1000 ppm), Musca domestica (at 1000 ppm) and Spodoptera eridana (at 1000 ppm). Species which were not significantly affected by MLA were: Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Aphis fabae, Diabrotica undecimpunctuata howardi and Tetranychus urticae. MLA also behaved as a feeding deterrent, with an LC50 of ~300 ppm, to Spodoptera larvae feeding on bean leaves.

Gregory Mankiw, Principles of Economics. Instruments can be divided into two subsets: a) monetary policy instruments and b) fiscal policy instruments. Monetary policy is conducted by the central bank of a country (such as the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) or of a supranational region (such as the Euro zone). Fiscal policy is conducted by the executive and legislative branches of the government and deals with managing a nation‚Äôs budget. Monetary policy Monetary policy instruments are used for managing short- term rates (the federal funds rate and discount rates in the U.S.), and changing reserve requirements for commercial banks. Monetary policy can be either expansive for the economy (short-term rates low relative to the inflation rate) or restrictive for the economy (short-term rates high relative to the inflation rate). Historically, the major objective of monetary policy had been to use these policy instruments to manage or curb domestic inflation. More recently, central bankers have often focused on a second objective: managing economic growth, as both inflation and economic growth are highly interrelated. Fiscal policy Fiscal policy consists in managing the national budget and its financing so as to influence economic activity. This entails the expansion or contraction of government expenditures related to specific government programs such as building roads or infrastructure, military expenditures and social welfare programs. It also includes the raising of taxes to finance government expenditures and the raising of debt (Treasuries in the U.S.) to bridge the gap (budget deficit) between revenues (tax receipts) and expenditures related to the implementation of government programs. Raising taxes and reducing the budget deficit is deemed to be a restrictive fiscal policy as it would reduce aggregate demand and slow down GDP growth. Lowering taxes and increasing the budget deficit is considered an expansive fiscal policy that would increase aggregate demand and stimulate the economy. History The classification of some macroeconomic variables as instruments and some others as targets or objectives is originally due to Jan Tinbergen, who used these concepts in his books On the Theory of Economic Policy (1952) and Economic Policy: Principles and Design (1955).Klein, Lawrence (2004), 'The contribution of Jan Tinbergen to economic science', De Economist 152 (2), pp. 155-157.

Early career Born in Stillwater, Oklahoma, in 1980, he lived in Perry, Oklahoma until 1990, then moved with his family to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he finished high school. In 1999, he co-founded the group Doubting Thomas with Jenks High School buddies Ab Colby and Rockwell Ryan Ripperger. While a student at Abilene Christian University in Abilene, Texas, McCloud and Ripperger later morphed into the successful indie group Stephen Speaks. The band's album No More Doubt did well, spreading through college campuses and the newly formed Internet sharing service, Napster. Through word of mouth, the singles \\"Out of My League\\" and \\"Passenger Seat\\" were picked up internationally and both songs went to No. 1 on Filipino radio stations throughout the Spring of 2003, breaking all previous pop music records for that country. The album, then signed and distributed through Warner Bros., went certified platinum for that market. A music video for \\"Passenger Seat\\" was also produced and went to No. 1 on MTV Asia. For the Filipino tour, the McCloud/Ripperger duo was expanded to include Ripperger's brother Dain Samuelson (percussion), Amber Sturges (vocals), Blake Howard (bass), and Blake Farmer (drums). After the surprise radio and music video success in Manila, Philippines, Ripperger and McCloud disbanded Stephen Speaks, and McCloud relocated to Nashville, TN to pursue a solo career as an indie singer and songwriter. Ripperger (who then became known as Rockwell Ryan) began performing once again under the Stephen Speaks name in 2004, releasing several albums to date. Solo work McCloud released a limited edition of untitled acoustic demos in 2002, one of which (\\"Miles Between Us\\" (aka The Airplane Song)) was featured in 2004's indie film Decoys which aired internationally on the SciFi channel. McCloud's first solo album Kind of Life was produced in 2004 by Nashville indie producer Donnie Boutwell. TJ's solo debut, Kind of Life was released in 2004. His latest release was 2008's Long Live Love-EP, a collection of love songs that includes a version of the popular indie hit \\"Out of My League\\" in its original arrangement, which has been used in several highly viewed user-made romantic mash-up videos on YouTube ‚Äì most notably with Jim and Pam from NBC's The Office. Children's music In 2006 McCloud wrote and sang an album of children's music called All God's Animals, in association with Eric Wyse and Brandon Scott Thomas (the ZOE group), which he has described as \\"kids' songs that moms won't hate\\". It was re-released in 2009, and due to its success, was nominated by the GMA for a Dove Award in the category of \\"Best Children's Collection\\". A follow-up collection was released, called \\"Sailing in the Ocean (in the belly of a fish)\\". In 2008, a Christmas collection was released, called What I Love About Christmas. Worship music In 2009, McCloud co-wrote the modern worship song, \\"Rooftops\\", with Steven Patterson of the worship band Branch. The song was included on the 2009 album Nothing to Lose-Live EP. Mission work and Ministry In 2006, TJ and his wife, Holly, moved to the Dominican Republic to start a Christian youth outreach center in the town of Rio San Juan. They worked there with Manna Global Ministries until September 2008, when they moved back to Nashville to continue writing music and working in ministry. He is currently serving as the Director of Missions at Lipscomb University.

Biography Gaspar de Alba was born on July 29, 1958 in El Paso, Texas near its border with Ciudad Ju√°rez. She received a bachelor's in 1980 and a master's in 1983 in English from the University of Texas at El Paso, and a Ph.D. in American Studies in 1994 from the University of New Mexico. To her students she is known as La Profe or Gaspar and currently teaches classes on border consciousness, bilingual creative writing, Chicana Lesbian literature, barrio popular culture, and graduate courses on Chicana theory. In 1994, she was one of six founding faculty members of the then C√©sar Ch√°vez Center for Interdisciplinary Instruction in Chicana and Chicano Studies at University of California, Los Angeles. Gaspar de Alba served as chair of that department from 2007-2010 and worked to approve and implement the second Ph.D. program in Chicana/o Studies at UCLA. Since 2013, Gaspar de Alba has been chairing the LGBTQ Studies Department at UCLA, where she is also working on a proposal for the first Ph.D. program in LGBTQ Studies in the nation. Gaspar de Alba has published extensively, and her novels, stories, and poetry have won several literary awards. Her doctoral dissertation \\"Mi Casa Es Su Casa: The Cultural Politics of Chicano Art\\" won the 1994 Ralph Henry Gabriel American Studies Association Award. Her work has been published in several languages and focuses primarily on gender and sexuality. Her 2005 novel Desert Blood: The Ju√°rez Murders won the Lambda Literary Award for Best Lesbian Mystery Novel and the Latino Book Award for Best Mystery Novel. This novel is based on the female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez, around which Gaspar de Alba researched and organized a conference. The mystery is based on the unresolved murders of over five-hundred Mexican women and girls along the border in El Paso, Texas, the region where Gaspar de Alba is originally from. In the book, a Mexican Maquiladora worker is found dead with her disembodied baby. Another character in the novel, Ivon, a lesbian professor in Los Angeles who was supposed to adopt the baby, becomes outraged at the growing violence against women at the border. She also becomes suspicious of the border patrol's role in the violence and of the similarities between the growing number of cases. The novel points out the injustices of the treatment of Mexican Immigrants/Mexican-Americans, the corruption of the government institutions on both sides of the border, femicide, and more.

He came to Grahamstown via a doctorate at the University of Hamburg and a post at Oxford University (1886‚Äì1889 as curator of the Fielding Herbarium and a lecturer in Botany). Working under Prof. Sir Isaac Bayley Balfour and Prof. Sydney Howard Vines, he developed an interest in the family Crassulaceae and contributed an account of this group to Engler & Prantl's Nat√ºrl. Pflanzenfamilien. While at Oxford, he translated, with Edward Bagnall Poulton and Arthur Shipley, August Weismann's \\"Essays upon Heredity and Kindred Biological Problems\\". Coming to the museum in Grahamstown gave him the opportunity to broaden his interests and develop the second largest herbarium in South Africa which had been founded by W. G. Atherstone in 1860. His father-in-law, Peter MacOwan, had been its honorary curator from 1862 to 1869 before moving to Somerset East. When MacOwan retired from his subsequent post as director of the Cape Town Botanical Garden and curator of the Cape Government Herbarium, he returned to Grahamstown and assisted Schonland in the development of the local herbarium. The Irish descendant Henry George Flanagan of the Eastern Cape contributed to this Herbarium with specimens, both in Grahamstown and in Cape Town. Schonland approached one of the Rhodes Trustees, Dr. Leander Starr Jameson to assist in funding. Jameson, soon to be elected Member of Parliament for Albany and Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, promised ¬£50,000 without consulting his fellow Trustees. At first they refused to confirm the grant; then, persuaded by Schonland, they made over De Beers Preference Shares to the value of ¬£50 000 to Rhodes University College, founded by Act of Parliament on May 31, 1904. By the time Schonland retired, the Botany Department and Rhodes University had become an established centre of taxonomic research and learning in South Africa. He played a leading role in the Botanical Survey of South Africa which had been initiated by Pole Evans. He was a foundation member of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science, honorary member of the Geological Society of South Africa, foundation member and Fellow of the Royal Soc. of S. Afr. His name was originally spelt Sch√∂nland, but he later dropped the umlaut. He is commemorated in Schoenlandia L.Bol., Euphorbia schoenlandii Pax, Brachystelma schonlandianum Schltr. and Sebaea schoenlandii Schinz. Selmar Schonland married Peter MacOwan's daughter Flora in 1895 and was the father of Sir Basil Schonland who contributed greatly to lightning research and radar development.

Putilov Plant and Perm Plant delivered 348 pieces in 1911-27. By 1936, the RKKA possessed 101 M1910s, including 5 practice pieces. Work on modernizing the gun started in 1936. Because of small number of M1910s in service, extensive upgrade was not considered worthwhile. The gun was rechambered for larger cartridge, same as used by the 152 mm howitzer M1909/30; upgraded barrels received a mark \\"lengthened chamber\\". Some pieces also had their wooden wheels replaced by steel ones with rubber tires, resulting in much higher transportation speed of 18 km/h. The modernized weapon was officially adopted as 152 mm howitzer model 1910/37. By 1941, all M1910 howitzers were upgraded. There was no production of new pieces. The design of M1910/37 was typical for World War I era howitzer. The gun had short (12 calibers) barrel with eccentric interrupted screw breechblock; hydraulic recoil buffer and pneumatic recuperator were both mounted under the barrel. The carriage was of single trail type with limited traverse and, typically, unsprung wooden wheels (some pieces received metal wheels with solid rubber tires). The gun was typically towed by a horse team (eight horses) by means of a limber. For each gun three horse-drawn ammunition boxes were issued; each box held 22 projectiles and 24 propellant charges. Organization and employment An identically looking 152 mm howitzer M1910. Under the organization of 1939, each rifle division had a howitzer regiment with a 152 mm howitzers battalion (12 pieces). In July 1941 these regiment were cancelled. Same fate befell 152 mm howitzers battalions of motorized and armored divisions. Corps artillery units didn't employ 152 mm howitzers early in the war (they did use howitzer- guns ML-20); but from late 1943 the recreated corps artillery included a regiment consisted of five batteries (totaling 20 pieces), equipped, along with other types, with 152 mm howitzers. By 1 June 1944, there were 192 such pieces in corps artillery. Reserve of the Main Command included howitzer regiments (48 pieces) and heavy howitzer brigades (32 pieces), sometimes organized into artillery divisions. By the outbreak of German-Soviet War older 152 mm howitzers were being replaced by the newer M-10. However the M-10 production rate was slow, so by June 1941 the M1910/37 was still in service and was employed by the RKKA in the German-Soviet War. However, no details of its service are available. Summary The M1910/37 was a relatively minor upgrade of a World War I-era howitzer, which did not address the main flaws of the latter, namely: * Limited towing speed due to unsprung wheels * Limited elevation and very small traverse A short barrel meant short range, less than that of its main adversaries, such as the German 15 cm sFH 18 (8.8 km vs 13.3 km). Low muzzle velocity and small traverse also made the gun helpless against enemy armor. On the other side, the M1910/37 was rugged, reliable and relatively light. Ammunition When set to fragmentation action, the OF-530 produced fragments which covered an area 70 m wide and 30 m deep. When set to HE action, the exploding shell produced a crater about 3.5 m in diameter and about 1.2 m deep. {border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" |- style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff\\" colspan=\\"6\\" Available ammunitionShirokorad A.

Early life  On December 2, 1846, Bissell was born in River John, Nova Scotia. Bissell's father was William Sutherland (1811-1907), a sea captain. Bissell's mother was Eleanor (nee Putnam) Sutherland (1817-1853). At an early age, her family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin, where they settled.  Career  By age 16, Bissell was a school teacher. After Bissell married Melville R. Bissell at 19, they became a joint partner in their crockery and china business. The Bissell Sweeper website recounts that Mrs. Bissell complained to her husband about sawdust that collected in their carpets and was difficult to remove, whereupon he made great improvements to a new invention called the carpet sweeper. When Bissell's husband invented the Bissell carpet sweeper in 1876, Bissell became a salesperson traveling from town to town selling the sweeper. Bissell was the number one salesperson.  Executive  After her husband's death in 1889 and with five children, Bissell took over the business and became the chief executive officer of the Bissell company. Bissell established new guidelines on trademarks and patents and moved Bissell carpet sweepers into the international market. By 1899 she had created the largest organization of its kind in the world. In 1919, Bissell also became the chairman of the Bissell company. As president of the corporation and chairman of the board, Bissell introduced progressive labor policies including workman's compensation and pension plans long before these practices were widespread in industry. It was said of her that she \\"Studied business the way other women of her time studied French.\\" She kept pace with the growing complexities of industrialism and knew every facet of the Bissell production.  Philanthropist  Bissell was a charter member of the Ladies Literary Club, a life member of the Women's City Club, and an active member of Zonta. She was also one of the best singers, most people did not know this but during lunch breaks, she would often perform for her peers. She served on the board of The Clark Memorial Home, and was for years the sole woman member of the National Hardware Men's Association. Bissell was a generous philanthropist. She was the first woman trustee of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was actively involved in Bissell House, a recreation and training program for Grand Rapids, Michigan youth and immigrant women. She also served on the board of what was to become Blodgett Home for Children.  Personal life  Bissell's husband was Melville Reuben Bissell. They had five children, Anna Dotelle Bissell (b. 1868), Lillie May Bissell (b. 1871), Melville Reuben Bissell (b. 1882), Harvey Bissell (1885), and Irving Joy Bissell (b. 1888). In 1889, Bissell's husband died from pneumonia. On November 8, 1934, Bissell died in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Bissell is buried in Oakhill Cemetery in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Legacy  In July 2016 a seven-foot (2.1 m) statue of Bissell was unveiled; it is located outside the DeVos Place Grand Gallery in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The bronze statue with \\"Anna Bissell (1846-1934)\\" was designed by Ann Hirsch. It was funded by the Peter Secchia family. Bissell's home known as the Bissell House in Grand Rapids, Michigan no longer exists, however, its site is now occupied by NBC television affiliate station WOOD-TV.

Enflo (; born 20 May 1944) is a Swedish mathematician working primarily in functional analysis, a field in which he solved problems that had been considered fundamental. Three of these problems had been open for more than forty years:Page 586 in Halmos 1990. * The basis problem and the approximation problemPer Enflo: A counterexample to the approximation problem in Banach spaces. Acta Mathematica vol. 130, no. 1, Juli 1973 and later * the invariant subspace problem for Banach spaces. In solving these problems, Enflo developed new techniques which were then used by other researchers in functional analysis and operator theory for years. Some of Enflo's research has been important also in other mathematical fields, such as number theory, and in computer science, especially computer algebra and approximation algorithms. Enflo works at Kent State University, where he holds the title of University Professor. Enflo has earlier held positions at the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, √âcole Polytechnique, (Paris) and The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. Enflo is also a concert pianist.  Enflo's contributions to functional analysis and operator theory  In mathematics, Functional analysis is concerned with the study of vector spaces and operators acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of functional spaces, in particular transformations of functions, such as the Fourier transform, as well as in the study of differential and integral equations. In functional analysis, an important class of vector spaces consists of the complete normed vector spaces over the real or complex numbers, which are called Banach spaces. An important example of a Banach space is a Hilbert space, where the norm arises from an inner product. Hilbert spaces are of fundamental importance in many areas, including the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, stochastic processes, and time-series analysis. Besides studying spaces of functions, functional analysis also studies the continuous linear operators on spaces of functions.  Hilbert's fifth problem and embeddings  At Stockholm University, Hans R√•dstr√∂m suggested that Enflo consider Hilbert's fifth problem in the spirit of functional analysis.R√•dstr√∂m had himself published several articles on Hilbert's fifth problem from the point of view of semigroup theory. R√•dstr√∂m was also the (initial) advisor of Martin Ribe, who wrote a thesis on metric linear spaces that need not be locally convex; Ribe also used a few of Enflo's ideas on metric geometry, especially \\"roundness\\", in obtaining independent results on uniform and Lipschitz embeddings (Benyamini and Lindenstrauss). This reference also describes results of Enflo and his students on such embeddings. In two years, 1969‚Äì1970, Enflo published five papers on Hilbert's fifth problem; these papers are collected in Enflo (1970), along with a short summary. Some of the results of these papers are described in Enflo (1976) and in the last chapter of Benyamini and Lindenstrauss.  Applications in computer science  Enflo's techniques have found application in computer science. Algorithm theorists derive approximation algorithms that embed finite metric spaces into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces with low \\"distortion\\" (in Gromov's terminology for the Lipschitz category; c.f. Banach‚ÄìMazur distance). Low- dimensional problems have lower computational complexity, of course. More importantly, if the problems embed well in either the Euclidean plane or the three-dimensional Euclidean space, then geometric algorithms become exceptionally fast. However, such embedding techniques have limitations, as shown by Enflo's (1969) theorem:Theorem 15.4.1 in Matou≈°ek. : For every m\\\\geq 2, the Hamming cube C_m cannot be embedded with \\"distortion D\\" (or less) into 2^m-dimensional Euclidean space if D < \\\\sqrt{ m }. Consequently, the optimal embedding is the natural embedding, which realizes \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^m as a subspace of m-dimensional Euclidean space.Matou≈°ek 370. This theorem, \\"found by Enflo [1969], is probably the first result showing an unbounded distortion for embeddings into Euclidean spaces. Enflo considered the problem of uniform embeddability among Banach spaces, and the distortion was an auxiliary device in his proof.\\"Matou≈°ek 372.  Geometry of Banach spaces  A uniformly convex space is a Banach space so that, for every \\\\epsilon>0 there is some \\\\delta>0 so that for any two vectors with \\\\|x\\\\|\\\\le1 and \\\\|y\\\\|\\\\le 1, : \\\\|x+y\\\\|>2-\\\\delta implies that : \\\\|x-y\\\\|<\\\\epsilon. Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short. In 1972 Enflo proved that \\"every super-reflexive Banach space admits an equivalent uniformly convex norm\\".Beauzamy 1985, page 298.Pisier.  The basis problem and Mazur's goose  With one paper, which was published in 1973, Per Enflo solved three problems that had stumped functional analysts for decades: The basis problem of Stefan Banach, the \\"Goose problem\\" of Stanislaw Mazur, and the approximation problem of Alexander Grothendieck. Grothendieck had shown that his approximation problem was the central problem in the theory of Banach spaces and continuous linear operators.  Basis problem of Banach  The basis problem was posed by Stefan Banach in his book, Theory of Linear Operators. Banach asked whether every separable Banach space has a Schauder basis. A Schauder basis or countable basis is similar to the usual (Hamel) basis of a vector space; the difference is that for Hamel bases we use linear combinations that are finite sums, while for Schauder bases they may be infinite sums. This makes Schauder bases more suitable for the analysis of infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces including Banach spaces. Schauder bases were described by Juliusz Schauder in 1927. Let V denote a Banach space over the field F. A Schauder basis is a sequence (bn) of elements of V such that for every element v ‚àà V there exists a unique sequence (Œ±n) of elements in F so that : v = \\\\sum_{n \\\\in \\\\N} \\\\alpha_n b_n \\\\, where the convergence is understood with respect to the norm topology. Schauder bases can also be defined analogously in a general topological vector space. In 1937, Polish mathematician Stanislaw Mazur promised a \\"live goose\\" as the prize for solving problem 153 in the Scottish Book. In 1972, Mazur presented the goose to Per Enflo.  Problem 153 in the Scottish Book: Mazur's goose  In 1972 Stanislaw Mazur awarded Enflo the promised live goose for solving a problem in the Scottish book. Banach and other Polish mathematicians would work on mathematical problems at the Scottish Caf√©. When a problem was especially interesting and when its solution seemed difficult, the problem would be written down in the book of problems, which soon became known as the Scottish Book. For problems that seemed especially important or difficult or both, the problem's proposer would often pledge to award a prize for its solution. On 6 November 1936, Stanislaw Mazur posed a problem on representing continuous functions. Formally writing down problem 153 in the Scottish Book, Mazur promised as the reward a \\"live goose\\", an especially rich price during the Great Depression and on the eve of World War II. Fairly soon afterwards, it was realized that Mazur's problem was closely related to Banach's problem on the existence of Schauder bases in separable Banach spaces. Most of the other problems in the Scottish Book were solved regularly. However, there was little progress on Mazur's problem and a few other problems, which became famous open problems to mathematicians around the world.Mauldin  Grothendieck's formulation of the approximation problem  Grothendieck's work on the theory of Banach spaces and continuous linear operators introduced the approximation property. A Banach space is said to have the approximation property, if every compact operator is a limit of finite-rank operators. The converse is always true.Joram Lindenstrauss and L. Tzafriri. In a long monograph, Grothendieck proved that if every Banach space had the approximation property, then every Banach space would have a Schauder basis. Grothendieck thus focused the attention of functional analysts on deciding whether every Banach space have the approximation property.  Enflo's solution  In 1972, Per Enflo constructed a separable Banach space that lacks the approximation property and a Schauder basis.Enflo's \\"sensation\\" is discussed on page 287 in Introductions to Enflo's solution were written by Halmos, by Johnson, by Kwapie≈Ñ, by Lindenstrauss and Tzafriri, by Nedevski and Trojanski, and by Singer. In 1972, Mazur awarded a live goose to Enflo in a ceremony at the Stefan Banach Center in Warsaw; the \\"goose reward\\" ceremony was broadcast throughout Poland.Ka≈Çu≈ºa, Saxe, Eggleton, Mauldin.  Invariant subspace problem and polynomials  In functional analysis, one of the most prominent problems was the invariant subspace problem, which required the evaluation of the truth of the following proposition: :Given a complex Banach space H of dimension > 1 and a bounded linear operator T : H ‚Üí H, then H has a non-trivial closed T-invariant subspace, i.e. there exists a closed linear subspace W of H which is different from {0} and H such that T(W) ‚äÜ W. For Banach spaces, the first example of an operator without an invariant subspace was constructed by Enflo. (For Hilbert spaces, the invariant subspace problem remains open.) Enflo proposed a solution to the invariant subspace problem in 1975, publishing an outline in 1976. Enflo submitted the full article in 1981 and the article's complexity and length delayed its publication to 1987Beauzamy 1988; Yadav. Enflo's long \\"manuscript had a world-wide circulation among mathematicians\\"Yadav, page 292. and some of its ideas were described in publications besides Enflo (1976).For example, Radjavi and Rosenthal (1982). Enflo's works inspired a similar construction of an operator without an invariant subspace for example by Beauzamy, who acknowledged Enflo's ideas. In the 1990s, Enflo developed a \\"constructive\\" approach to the invariant subspace problem on Hilbert spaces.Page 401 in . Enflo's method of (\\"forward\\") \\"minimal vectors\\" is also noted in the review of this research article by Gilles Cassier in Mathematical Reviews: Enflo's method of minimal vector is described in greater detail in a survey article on the invariant subspace problem by Enflo and Victor Lomonosov, which appears in the Handbook of the Geometry of Banach Spaces (2001).  Multiplicative inequalities for homogeneous polynomials  An essential idea in Enflo's construction was \\"concentration of polynomials at low degrees\\": For all positive integers m and n, there exists C(m,n) > 0 such that for all homogeneous polynomials P and Q of degrees m and n (in k variables), then > |PQ|\\\\geq C(m,n)|P|\\\\,|Q|, where |Pdenotes the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of P. Enflo proved that C(m,n) does not depend on the number of variables k. Enflo's original proof was simplified by Montgomery.Schmidt, page 257. This result was generalized to other norms on the vector space of homogeneous polynomials. Of these norms, the most used has been the Bombieri norm. = Bombieri norm = The Bombieri norm is defined in terms of the following scalar product: For all \\\\alpha,\\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^N we have : \\\\langle X^\\\\alpha X^\\\\beta \\\\rangle = 0 if \\\\alpha eq \\\\beta : For every \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^N we define ||X^\\\\alpha||^2 = \\\\frac{|\\\\alpha|!}{\\\\alpha!}, where we use the following notation: if \\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1,\\\\dots,\\\\alpha_N) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^N, we write |\\\\alpha= \\\\Sigma_{i=1}^N \\\\alpha_i and \\\\alpha! = \\\\Pi_{i=1}^N (\\\\alpha_i!) and X^\\\\alpha = \\\\Pi_{i=1}^N X_i^{\\\\alpha_i}. The most remarkable property of this norm is the Bombieri inequality: Let P,Q be two homogeneous polynomials respectively of degree d^\\\\circ(P) and d^\\\\circ(Q) with N variables, then, the following inequality holds: : \\\\frac{d^\\\\circ(P)!d^\\\\circ(Q)!}{(d^\\\\circ(P)+d^\\\\circ(Q))!}||P||^2 \\\\, ||Q||^2 \\\\leq ||P\\\\cdot Q||^2 \\\\leq ||P||^2 \\\\, ||Q||^2. In the above statement, the Bombieri inequality is the left-hand side inequality; the right-hand side inequality means that the Bombieri norm is a norm of the algebra of polynomials under multiplication. The Bombieri inequality implies that the product of two polynomials cannot be arbitrarily small, and this lower-bound is fundamental in applications like polynomial factorization (or in Enflo's construction of an operator without an invariant subspace).  Applications  Enflo's idea of \\"concentration of polynomials at low degrees\\" has led to important publications in number theoryMontgomery. Schmidt. Beauzamy and Enflo. Beauzamy, Bombieri, Enflo, and Montgomery algebraic and Diophantine geometry,Bombieri and Gubler and polynomial factorization.Knuth. Beauzamy, Enflo, and Wang.  Mathematical biology: Population dynamics  In applied mathematics, Per Enflo has published several papers in mathematical biology, specifically in population dynamics.  Human evolution  Enflo has also published in population genetics and paleoanthropology.The model for the evolution of human population genetics (developed by Enflo and his coauthors) was reported on the cover page of a major Swedish newspaper. Today, all humans belong to one population of Homo sapiens sapiens, which is individed by species barrier. However, according to the \\"Out of Africa\\" model this is not the first species of hominids: the first species of genus Homo, Homo habilis, evolved in East Africa at least 2 Ma, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. Homo erectus evolved more than 1.8 Ma, and by 1.5 Ma had spread throughout the Old World. Anthropologists have been divided as to whether current human population evolved as one interconnected population (as postulated by the Multiregional Evolution hypothesis), or evolved only in East Africa, speciated, and then migrating out of Africa and replaced human populations in Eurasia (called the \\"Out of Africa\\" Model or the \\"Complete Replacement\\" Model). Neanderthals and modern humans coexisted in Europe for several thousand years, but the duration of this period is uncertain. Modern humans may have first migrated to Europe 40‚Äì43,000 years ago. Neanderthals may have lived as recently as 24,000 years ago in refugia on the south coast of the Iberian peninsula such as Gorham's Cave.Finlayson, C., F. G. Pacheco, J. Rodriguez-Vidal, D. A. Fa, J.

Nature advanced online publication. Inter-stratification of Neanderthal and modern human remains has been suggested, but is disputed. With Hawks and Wolpoff, Enflo published an explanation of fossil evidence on the DNA of Neanderthal and modern humans. This article tries to resolve a debate in the evolution of modern humans between theories suggesting either multiregional and single African origins. In particular, the extinction of Neanderthals could have happened due to waves of modern humans entered Europe ‚Äì in technical terms, due to \\"the continuous influx of modern human DNA into the Neandertal gene pool.\\"Page 665: * P√§√§bo, Svante et alia. \\"Genetic analyses from ancient DNA.\\" Annu.

It was released by Luc Bernard and Silver Sphere Studios on Steam July 31, 2008. A Wii version was planned, but eventually cancelled. Gameplay The gameplay involves the player controlling two characters simultaneously. In the Wii version, one will be controlled with the analogue stick of the Nunchuk and the other with the pointer function of the Wii Remote. Eternity's Childs level editor can be used with the game's editable source material to remake or edit the entire game. Development Eternity's Child was initially developed for Xbox Live Arcade, and was one of the first games to be made with the XNA toolset. On September 9, 2007, it was revealed that it was changed to a retail Nintendo DS game as well as a downloadable WiiWare game. However, Bernard later confirmed that the Nintendo DS version has been canceled, while also announcing that the game will come to PCs via Steam. Bernard is also considering releasing the game on the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, though he insists the WiiWare version will still be the best iteration of the game because of the platform specific controls. Because of the move to the Wii, the gameplay style of the XNA version has been changed in favor of one that takes advantage of the Wii Remote. Alten8 are porting the original code, and adapting the game to Nintendo's standards for the Wii version, and hope that previous errors can be resolved. However, Bernard stated on his blog in February 2009 that he was \\"not happy at all that it's still not out on Wiiware\\" and that Alten8 were \\"taking the whole team for idiots.\\" The Wii version, while it hasn't been officially cancelled, is considered vaporware, as no further news have been released as of today. Reception Gametunnel gave Eternity's Child a score of 6.3/10. Russ Carroll said \\"it certainly isn't the disaster it is made out to be\\", but \\"it feels like it is brushing up against greatness\\". Eternity's Child was panned by gaming site Destructoid for \\"flawed design\\", \\"horrible animation\\" and \\"broken controls\\". In reviewing the game, which he gave a 1/10, Anthony Burch went so far as to say that it was \\"the worst game I've played in several years.\\" Bernard responded to the review, calling it \\"highly unprofessional\\", and defended the title by stating that Destructoid did not play the patched version. Bernard has drawn further criticism after he decided to remove the Destructoid robot from the game in response to the review. The game was also panned by Mike Fahey of Kotaku for its \\"story, or lack thereof\\", two-character mechanic, poor AI, and somewhat chaotic level design. However, he also noted that its visual style and music are appealing, and that the included level editor was also an extra bonus, and stated that the game \\"does have a lot to offer for $5\\". He concluded that the game is \\"still very much a work in progress\\". The game received a 3/5 by de-frag.com. They mention that \\"Eternity's Child shows a lot of promise, but numerous small mistakes and some frustrating level design spoils what is otherwise an enjoyable game.\\" The game was reviewed with the 1.02 patch and they mention that Eternity's Child is a difficult game to judge. But overall \\"If you enjoy 2D platformers and are willing to tolerate some extremely difficult levels and slightly loose controls, it's worth picking up.\\" Eternity's Childs soundtrack was nominated on the GANG Awards for \\"Best Audio Other\\". Sequel A sequel titled Eternity's Child 2: Retro Child was announced in 2008. It plans to be a 16-bit remake of an old canceled GBA game. No further news has been released as of today. Eternity's Child: The Lost Chapter A cancelled mobile version of Eternity's Child, Eternity's Child: The Lost Chapter, was released for free. The game contains five stages and three difficulty levels. It is no longer available for download as of today.

The operation started out importing the Ford Model T cars and the Ford Model TT trucks in kit form from the United States for assembly in Brazil. The Ford brand, however, had already been present in the country since 1904 with both vehicles being sold in Brazil. Initially operating in rented buildings, Ford opened its own plant in 1921 in S√£o Paulo. Called Solon Plant, it was a scaled-down Highland Park Plant, also designed by Albert Kahn. It was one of the last 3-storey plants built by Ford. In 1953 Ford opened a new and bigger plant also in S√£o Paulo, called Ipiranga Plant. Still building CKD trucks and automobiles, the Ipiranga Plant was geared for local manufacturing in the early 1950s. From assembling to manufacturing Ford Motor do Brasil S.A., as it was its name in those days, inaugurated a full blown manufacturing operation on August 26, 1957 with the first Ford F-600 medium truck, very similar to the US-made F-600, leaving the production line featuring a V8 272 cu.in displacement engine, 40% of its parts being Brazilian made. The remaining items were still imported from the United States, but gradually, as the number of OEM parts suppliers in Brazil grew, this number decreased significantly. The F-600 was followed in 1958 by the F-100 pick-up truck and in 1959 by the F-350 light truck. In 1958 the Ipiranga Plant was expanded with the start of local engine production (the V8 272 Y-block engine). Takeover with a French accent Aero Willys Itamaraty Executivo 1967 On October 9, 1967, Ford took control of troubled Willys- Overland do Brasil S.A. as majority shareholder and integrated the factory in S√£o Bernardo do Campo as well as the product mix of two mid-range sedans, the Aero-Willys and the Willys Itamaraty, the utility vehicle Willys F-75, the pick-up truck F-75 and the ever-popular off-roader Willys Jeep into their Brazilian line-up. When Ford acquired Willys' Brazilian operation, they inherited a work-in-progress that evolved into the front-wheel drive Ford Corcel, that was widely based on the Renault 12, but had its very own design. The Corcel was one of the most popular cars in the 1970s, it sold well as a four-door sedan and the two-door coupe was launched for younger buyers. Of those the more prestigious was the Ford Corcel GT with more power, a black hood and aggressive looking racing stripes on the sides. Streamlining the product mix The mid-range sedan at the time was the ancient Ford (Willys) Aero, in fact it was a modified version of the Aero-Eagle that Kaiser-Willys had started building in the USA way back in 1954 and had been on the market as Aero Willys. When Chevrolet launched the Opala in 1968, and it proved to be very popular in both the 2-door and 4-door models, Ford needed urgently a competitive replacement for the outdated Aero. Ford do Brasil also built the Ford Galaxie, one of the few V8 cars ever produced in Brazil, launched in 1967. It was initially equipped with 272cid or 292cid Y-blocks also used on pick-up trucks, using the North American 1966 four-door sedan body. It was the most expensive automobile produced in Brazil. In 1974 Ford do Brasil opened an engine factory in Taubat√©, near S√£o Paulo, to accommodate the production of the 2.3L 4-cylinder engine used on the Brazilian Maverick and exported to the USA. The Maverick days At the 1972 S√£o Paulo Auto Show in December the Ford Maverick was launched as a 1973 model, although it was nearly identical to the 1970 American model with contoured bumpers. Three models were available: the base Ford Maverick Super, the more posh Ford Maverick Super Luxo, both with the Willys 6-cylinder as standard, and the sporty Ford Maverick GT with the 302 V8 engine, which was optional in the Super Luxo. Bigger than the average Brazilian car it sold well in the first two years, after that only the 2-door Super Luxos was keeping up the numbers. It received the Taubat√© 2.3L 4-cylinder engine in 1975 and was heavily revised in 1977 but sales still declined and the Ford Maverick was quietly discontinued in 1979. The oil crisis During the world oil shock of the 1970's, Brazil began what is now a thriving industry of ethanol fuels extracted from sugar cane. \\"Movido √† √°lcool\\" (powered by alcohol) quickly became a sales slogan for any car. Ford do Brasil was on the verge of launching the German Ford Escort and swiftly developed the higher compression rate engine for its latest model. The same happened for the small block V8 of Ford's upper class models Ford Galaxie and Ford Landau that were then discontinued in 1983. Merger with Volkswagen The difficult economic situation in South America in the eighties due to astronomic inflation rates forced manufacturers to look into options that would help to save money. The Brazilian and Argentine subsidiaries of Ford and Volkswagen decided to merge into a new holding, named AutoLatina, in 1987. Volkswagen held 51% of the shares, and Ford the remaining 49%. Each brand maintained their own corporate image, the marketing and sales structures, as well as independent dealerships and service shops. All other departments were consolidated, allowing significant cost cutting, but also cutting the workforce almost in half. The Autolatina years The Ford Escort, introduced in both its 3- and 5-door version in 1983, and its convertible version (launched in 1985) was selling well. Yet, Ford decided to drop the 5-door version by 1986 and to concentrate on the younger car-buying market with its 3-door version. In 1989, Ford do Brasil exchanged the 1.6 CHT engine for the 1.8 version of the VW AP engine into the Ford Escort, mated to a gearbox from the German Volkswagen Golf, the performance rose to 90HP in the Ghia version and 99HP in the sporty XR3. The joint car projects resulted in new models like the Ford Verona (aka Volkswagen Apollo) that was launched in 1989. These new cars, with identical platforms and VW engines‚Äîalthough a 1.6 version with Ford's the CHT engine was available, could be produced for a fraction of the cost, keeping both brands competitive against main rival Chevrolet. In 1990, the Ford Versailles, a facelifted version of the Volkswagen Santana), was launched in an increasingly more positive economical climate. Regained independence Ford and Volkswagen split amicably back to their individual divisions in 1994. This was partly due to the 75th anniversary of Ford do Brasil and partly because the dwindling sales figures on Ford's end prompted the American carmaker to seek independence from Volkswagen, to regain total control over all operations and to apply the lean production methods that had improved competitiveness in their home market. However technically Ford would continue to rely on engines and drivetrains from their former partner. In 1996 the German Ford Fiesta was also introduced as Ford's new low end model into the market, replacing the 1.0 Ford Escort Hobby that had been launched in 1993 as a \\"carro popular\\" (the people's car), a government incentive to the manufactures to produce cheap and fuel efficient cars. As a matter of fact the entire, now restyled, production of the whole range of Ford Escort models was relocated to Argentina, including the first Escort station wagon to be sold in Brazil. Ford do Brasil in the 21st century The Ford F12000/14000 was built from 1988 until 1996 Today Ford do Brasil manufactures models with four- cylinder engines 1.0/1.6 Zetec-Rocam and the 2.0 liter Duratec on localized low-cost versions of the global platforms like the Ford Ka, Ford Fiesta and the Ford Ecosport, a XUV version of the European Ford Fusion mk1. Ford do Brasil enjoys a stable market position, with an average market share of 12.5% it is ranked 4th in Brazilian sales. However, part of the overall success of the Ford America Latina operations, currently the one that provides the highest profit within the Ford Motor Company's global operation, is the brand new factory in Cama√ßari in the northern State of Bahia in which Ford invested US$4 billion and created a unique environment that consolidates production line with their direct suppliers' own facilities. Here the Ford Ecosport mini SUV and the Ford Fiesta are made for the Brazilian market and exported to other developing countries as well. While Ford do Brasil continues to offer European models like the Focus (imported from Argentina) the Ford F-250 pick- up truck, Since 2006, the four-cylinder version of the Mexican-built Ford Fusion has been sold as a lower-production-cost replacement for the Ford Mondeo, as fourth generation model would have been too expensive to be sold in Brazil, although it is sold in Argentina. Ford Fusion has sold quite well in Brazil, often topping the charts as the best selling car of its segment in Brazil. Ford do Brasil currently has 396 sales points and 233 dealerships. In 2019 it was decided to close the S√£o Bernardo do Campo plant with the Fiesta Products and exit the South American truck market.

Off-grid communities include Brigade Bay (coordinates ), Fircom Plateau (coordinates ), Sea Ranch (coordinates ). Facilities Gambier Island had a general store (closed about 2010) and one bed and breakfast. Barging companies provide service from Gibsons and Horseshoe Bay for transport of large items. Fire service is run by volunteers. There are no garbage processing facilities on the island. There is a community centre. Halkett Bay Provincial Park is located on the southeast side of Gambier. History Squamish people called the island Cha7√©lkwnech, in reference to its deep protected bays. It was a celebrated deer hunting area and was extensively used for resource gathering.https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/bcgnws/names/5270.html The island was named by Captain Richards in 1860 for James Gambier, Admiral of the Fleet who had a distinguished career in the British navy,, was a Governor of Newfoundland and served as a negotiator of the Treaty of Ghent ending The War of 1812 between Britain and the United States.

Life and career Ian Fraser was born in Glasgow on 3 February 1911, the only child of Alexander Reid Fraser, a Glasgow fur merchant, and his wife Margaret Russell MacFarlane. He was educated at Repton School and later studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1932 with First Class Honours. He finished his studies at the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Laws in 1935. The following year he was admitted to the Scottish Faculty of Advocates, where he soon earned a reputation as an excellent jurist. At the same time he held a teaching post at the University of Glasgow and from 1948 at the University of Edinburgh. His 1936 work \\"Outline of Constitutional Law\\" (2nd edition 1948) was soon regarded as the standard work on British constitutional law. During the war he served first as a sergeant in an anti-aircraft battery of the Territorial Army. Later he transferred to the Royal Artillery, was promoted to the rank of major and served in the theatre of war in Burma. In 1945 he was appointed Advocate Depute and eventually rose to be the Home Depute in the Crown Office. In 1953 he was appointed QC. In 1954 he served on the Scottish Law Reform Committee and from 1960 to 1962 on the Royal Commission on the Police. From 1959 to 1964 he served as Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. From 1964 to 1974, he was a Senator of the College of Justice and had the courtesy title of Lord Fraser. In 1974 he was appointed to the Privy Council, and on 13 January 1975 was created a life peer with the title Baron Fraser of Tullybelton, of Bankfoot in the County of Perth, and took the office of Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. Fraser was a very active member of the House of Lords and dealt primarily with issues of further development of the administration of justice. Even in his retirement, he was a chairman of the University Commission on the reform of higher education. He died on 17 February 1989 in a car crash on the M90 motorway between Perth and Edinburgh during a snow storm. Awards and honours Fraser was a member of the Royal Company of Archers. In 1975 he was appointed honorary chairman of the administrative committee of Gray's Inn, where he was an Honorary Bencher. In 1981 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College. He was awarded honorary doctorates (Legum Doctor) at the University of Glasgow in 1970 and at the University of Edinburgh in 1978. Family On 8 November 1943 Fraser married Mary Ursula Cynthia Gwendolen Macdonnell, daughter of Colonel Ian Harrison Macdonnell, with whom he had a son, Andrew.

The EP, titled 3√ó3 (as it featured three tracks and the band comprised three musicians), peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart in mid-1982. The success of the EP led to an appearance on Top of the Pops.

History The title came from a line in the 1973 Genesis song \\"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight\\" (\\"Paper late, cried a voice in the crowd\\"), which Genesis rehearsed at a soundcheck, leading to the conception of the song. \\"Paperlate\\" is one of two Genesis songs that features the Earth, Wind & Fire horn section, the other being \\"No Reply at All\\", also from the Abacab sessions.

It is the only species placed in the genus Clytolaema. It is common and among the species regularly seen at hummingbird feeders within its range. It is a relatively large hummingbird. The male is overall green with a coppery back and rump, a coppery-rufous tail and, as suggested by its common name, a highly iridescent ruby throat that can appear black from some angles. Females are green above and cinnamon below. Both sexes have a white post-ocular spot and a straight black bill. Taxonomy The Brazilian ruby was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Trochilus rubicauda in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The Brazilian ruby is the now the only species placed in the genus Clytolaema that was introduced by the ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in 1853. The 5 volumes were issued in 25 parts between 1849 and 1861. Title pages of all volumes bear the date of 1861. The type locality is Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The species is monotypic. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek ' meaning \\"glorious\\" and ' meaning \\"throat\\". The specific epithet rubricauda combines the Latin ' meaning \\"red\\" and ' meaning \\"tail\\".

Taking place in the fictional town of Peach Creek, its number of characters is fixed at 12 (13 if Plank, a board of wood who acts as one character's imaginary friend, is included). The show revolves around best friends Ed, Edd, and Eddy, collectively referred to as \\"the Eds\\", who live in a cul-de-sac with neighbors Kevin, Rolf, Nazz, Jimmy, Sarah, and Jonny. Three antagonistic teenage girls, known collectively as \\"the Kanker Sisters\\", live in the nearby \\"Park 'n' Flush\\" trailer park. Eddy's brother, who is mentioned throughout the series, is seen exclusively in the movie Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show. With the exception of Eddy's brother, all other characters are children or adolescents. The series' characters have received awards and nominations at the 2002 Fancy Anvil Awards, a fictional award show broadcast on Cartoon Network. Antonucci stated the personalities of the Eds are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons, and that the other characters are based on children he grew up with. Creation According to creator Danny Antonucci, the characters are based on real people from his life; the personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on his own traits, and the activities of his two sons while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters are based on children he grew up with. Rolf is based on himself and his cousins, since he grew up in a first-generation foreign immigrant household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada. Jimmy is based on one of his cousins, who spent most of his time playing with girls than boys and was rather feminine. Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he \\"thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own\\" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination. Antonucci said that the idea of children having multicolored tongues came after he saw his son and his friends with different-colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard. The characters went through a number of \\"walking cycles\\", a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product. Protagonists  Ed  Ed (Matt Hill) is the strong, airheaded, dimwitted, and considerate of the three who has very short hair. He wears a red-and-white striped shirt, a green jacket with two white stripes on each sleeve and purple-blue jeans. His skin is yellow, unlike the other characters, and he is known to laugh a lot and is happy most of the time. Ed has amazing physical strength, which is humorously worked into many of the show's plots. He has no chin and a prominent unibrow (which has led to the nicknames of \\"Funnelhead\\" and \\"Monobrow\\" by Eddy). His mind is a subculture grab-bag full of comics and monster movies, which he often confuses with reality, and which leads him to speak in non sequiturs almost all the time. Ed (to the misfortune of many people) is utterly at the mercy of his tyrannical younger sister Sarah and is an easy target of her manipulations, with Sarah threatening to tell their mother if she does not get her way. Ed is kindhearted, good-natured, and has a positive attitude towards almost everything and everyone, even to those who are not accommodating to him . He cares about the welfare of the other two Eds. He often sacrifices himself for his two best friends, the other cul-de- sac children, and even Sarah, for whom he cares deeply, though she treats him badly. He is absentminded and naive, making him the perfect candidate to help Eddy with his scams, as Ed hardly ever questions them. Even so, Ed never feels abused by Eddy. Ed enjoys buttered toast, gravy, cereal (namely Chunky Puffs), pudding skin, chickens, comics and monster movies. Much to the dismay of mysophobic Edd, he has poor personal hygiene, even to the point of being terrified of soap and liking the smell of stink bombs and sweaty boots. Though the Eds were outcasts throughout the series, in the series' TV movie finale Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, the three become friends with all the cul- de-sac children; even Sarah starts treating Ed nicely. Creator Danny Antonucci explained Ed's inspiration saying, \\"Ed is...me, following his own path and slightly dysfunctional, a daydreamer who while people are doing one thing, will be busy thinking of another.\\" He also described Ed as \\"slow, living in his own world and he really doesn't fit in with the rest of the crowd,\\" and explained that it was hard to decide who would voice him. Ed ended up being voiced by Matt Hill.  Edd (Double D)  Edd (Samuel Vincent) is the smartest of the Eds and the most polite, mature, curious, and somewhat ironic. As a result, he is more socially accepted by the rest of the kids than Ed and Eddy, usually acting as a peacemaker or offering the rest of the kids advice. To differentiate his homophonic name from Ed and Eddy, he is referred to as Double-D. Edd has a high IQ and is top of the class in most subjects at school, though he is the physically weakest of the Eds and despises P.E. and other sporting activities. As the most creative of the trio, he is able to construct things like planes, rocket cars, and roller coasters with junk he comes across and enjoys doing so. He also is able to play pedal steel guitar, but does not like to do so often. He often speaks using complex words and struggles to speak normally in high anxiety situations. His clothing usually consists of a red/orange shirt, purple shorts, red socks, and cyan shoes. He sleeps in a footed onesie, and in the later seasons and the movie, he wears a tie when going to school. He more famously wears a black ski hat with two white lines on each side of it (which has led to Eddy nicknaming him \\"Sockhead\\"). It is unknown what lies under Edd's hat; Ed and Eddy see Edd twice without his hat on. Whatever his hat hides, Edd is self-conscious about it; Eddy frequently blackmails Edd by threatening to reveal the contents of his hat. Edd is also self-conscious about a significant gap in his front teeth, thanks to Eddy poking fun at it. He is the only one of the trio to be an only child, and his parents leave sticky notes around his house as a means of communicating with him. Like the other two Eds, Edd's personality is largely based upon series creator Danny Antonucci, who has said \\"there's my Edd side, neurotic, analytical, must be organized. Also if Eddy and Ed (single D) were not around, Edd would be happy with his own company, something that works for me too.\\" Antonucci has also explained that the habit of Double Dee's parents to communicate with him through sticky notes was based on a habit of his own parents. Eddy Eddy (Tony Sampson) is the self-appointed leader of the Eds. He is arrogant, self-centred, ignorant, loud-mouthed, immature, greedy, and hot-tempered. He has pink/purple skin, with three long black hairs growing from his head, and his wardrobe consists usually of a yellow and red bowling shirt, blue jeans, and red shoes. He loves money, jawbreakers (which he likes to spend his ill-earned money on), dirty magazines (as hinted in \\"Luck of the Ed\\"), his room, and Chunky Puffs. Eddy ordinarily comes up with the plans for scamming people, but they usually fail, much to his frustration. Eddy will often, especially in the early seasons, slack off by suntanning or drinking a soda while his fellow Eds do all the work. His prized possessions include his magazines, king-sized bed, and disco ball. He also has a Barry White album and is a fan of Tom Jones. Eddy is the shortest of the Eds and takes this very seriously, hating the thought of people calling him short, suggesting he may have a Napoleon complex. Eddy sometimes boasts about his older brother and uses this to his advantage to gain respect. Like Kevin, Eddy can be cruel and acerbic, with a tendency to tease his peers, but deep down, Eddy only wants to be liked by everyone. Supporting characters Jonny Jonny, also known as Jonny 2x4 (David Paul Grove), is a loner and considered by his peers to be a nuisance. Jonny is often made fun of for his big head (Eddy usually refers to him as \\"Melonhead\\" or as a \\"bald badger\\") and has a tendency of getting his head caught in branches when climbing trees. He talks a lot, and frequently gets on the other kids' nerves. He is rarely seen without his imaginary friend, a 2x4 wooden board with drawn-on eyes and a mouth, aptly named Plank. Jonny seems innocent and gullible, and often forgives people no matter what they do. He does not seem to mind the antics of the Eds, and is often the most friendly out of all the cul-de-sac kids towards them. He is very protective of Plank, and will burst into acts of bravery or extreme aggression if Plank is stolen or harmed in some way. He does not seem to acknowledge that Plank is just an inanimate, silent, 2x4 piece of wood, and when asked for help with an imaginary friend, he claimed to have no clue what the Eds are talking about. He and Plank both have superhero alter egos (Captain Melonhead and Splinter the Wonderwood, respectively), which they assumed twice throughout the series; first in \\"Robbin' Ed\\" to thwart Eddy's \\"Thingamajig\\" scam and to fight Eddy's own one-time only alter ego, Professor Scam, and then in Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show to hunt down and get revenge on the Eds. After Big Picture Show, he and Plank become The Gourd and Timber the Dark Shard in order to take revenge on the entire cul-de-sac (although Plank reveals that there is no more time left in the movie at this point). Jimmy Jimmy (Keenan Christenson) is an insecure and innocent child, with a propensity to cry, and Sarah's best friend whom he is most often seen spending his time with. Jimmy is highly accident-prone, often seen sporting bandages, casts, and braces (particularly headgear), and is considered the weakest kid in the cul-de-sac. Though Jimmy has a gentle personality, he truly wishes to be strong and muscular, and many episodes demonstrate his desire for fame and stardom. He can be crafty when motivated, and had twice made scams that were very successful. Jimmy has shown how deeply attached he is to Sarah when someone tries to take her away from him. He wears a retainer to correct his teeth, due to a bowling pin accident during one of Eddy's scams. Sarah Sarah (Janyse Jaud) is Ed's grouchy, abusive, spoiled, commanding, annoying, short-tempered, whiny, rude, and extremely selfish younger sister who acts cute and kind to the Eds only when it suits her. She is commonly depicted with a disgruntled facial expression and treats her intimidated, trembling older brother, frightened by his sister's constant threats of tattling on him, with complete disdain. Imposing, Sarah frequently orders people (sometimes even those of higher rightful authority than her) around, and her desires often have to be met or else she will fling herself into a violent temper tantrum or threaten the person in question. Throughout the course of the series, Sarah has been shown to possess an infatuation with Edd, but still occasionally subjects him to abuse due to guilt by association with the other Eds. Kevin Kevin (Kathleen Barr) is a stereotypical jock. He is cynical, sarcastic and can be cruel at times. Kevin has a garage full of jawbreakers, due to the fact that his father works at a jawbreaker factory. He loves customizing his bike, skateboards, and snowboards. When not riding his trusty bike, he usually hangs out with Rolf and Nazz in the Lane. He hates the Eds to the point of paranoia, but his animosity towards them is mostly geared towards Eddy; the two are mortal enemies and often go entirely out of their way to humiliate or physically harm each other at the first opportunity (with Eddy referring to Kevin as \\"Shovel Chin\\"). He tends to call the Eds \\"dorks\\" and has a habit of coming up with words merged with \\"dork\\" to suit the situation. Like Edd, Kevin normally wears a hat and rarely takes it off; in the episode \\"Boys Will be Eds\\", Kevin takes off his hat for the first time and is shown to be bald, though a flashback episode reveals that he used to have long hair. In some episodes, he is shown to have a great fear of Eddy's brother; Eddy knows this and frequently uses his brother as leverage against Kevin. Rolf Rolf (Peter Kelamis) is a quirky, odd, and usually happy immigrant of an undetermined origin and culture with odd customs (which he displays frequently, and it often involves a wide variety of meat) and has a thick accent to match. Rolf is the son of a shepherd, a fact in which he takes great pride. He works on his parents' small farm within the cul-de-sac, and leads a scouting group called the \\"Urban Rangers,\\" which includes Jimmy, Plank, and Jonny. Rolf usually refers to himself in third person. His faithful farm animals are three pigs (one of which is named Wilfred), a goat named Victor, at least six chickens (two named Bridget and Gertrude), a cow named Beatrice, and five sheep. He generally appears to be friendly with the Eds (whom he calls the \\"Ed boys\\") unless they make a fool out of him or offend him in some way, in which case he is not afraid to use brute force. He seems to be very muscular, but this is usually only shown when he is angry. With his unusual customs and strange food, Rolf confuses the rest of the kids to no end, and his inability to comprehend the culture and customs of his new home is a running gag in the series. Nazz Nazz Van Bartonschmeer (Tabitha St. Germain; Jenn Forgie; Erin Fitzgerald) is a good-natured, sweet, mature yet somewhat ditzy, fashionable girl who normally treats her peers (including the Eds) respectfully; however, when antagonized she will react violently to the cause of her agitation or partake in harming the Eds as discipline for an alleged misdeed that they have committed. A majority of the male characters featured in the series are smitten with her, and an entire episode once chronicled their many failed attempts at wooing her. She also possesses a number of humorous eccentricities, such as the ability to yodel, substandard skills at playing a rather large tuba and is often depicted with poor table etiquette. Edd seems to be the Ed that Nazz is closest to, as he was the first character she'd kissed in the series in \\"The Day the Ed Stood Still\\", took him trick-or-treating in the Halloween special, and got him to dance with her at the school dance in \\"May I Have this Ed?\\". She appears to have a crush on Kevin, though he is mostly oblivious to this; he favors his bike more. Although one of the most mature of the neighborhood kids, she occasionally displays traits of the stereotypical \\"dumb blonde\\". She is presumably of Dutch descent, based on her surname. She is also the only character besides the Kankers to have a confirmed surname, ironically rumored to be an ad-lib by Erin Fitzgerald during recording. Other characters Kanker Sisters Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr), and May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie) are three half-sisters who serve as the main antagonists towards the cul-de-sac and its inhabitants. Lee is the leader with curly red hair that covers her eyes, Marie has blue hair, and May is the buck-toothed blonde. They live in the nearby trailer park called Park 'n' Flush. The mere presence of the Kankers is enough to terrify the cul-de-sac residents, and they have been shown to have volatile and destructive tempers. While all the Kankers supposedly like the Eds, it has been shown that May prefers Ed, Marie prefers Edd, and Lee prefers Eddy. Throughout the series, each of the Kankers repeatedly get the Eds and privately force themselves onto them with romantic intention, much to their horror. Eddy's Brother Eddy's Brother (Terry Klassen) is mentioned frequently throughout the series, mostly by Eddy, though his name is never revealed. Eddy mentions how his brother taught him much about how to scam, and to be a con artist, and throughout the series many of the children are shown to have a great fear and respect for him. He was previously an unseen character, but he finally makes an appearance in the movie Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show. Eddy's brother at first seems to be everything the other kids imagined, but it turns out that all of the folklore surrounding him was made up by Eddy to impress the other kids, and in reality he is a sadistic individual who refers to Eddy as a \\"pipsqueak\\" and bullies him mercilessly, which ultimately caused Eddy to become who he is. He works at the \\"Mondo a-Go Go\\" amusement park, but his specific job is unknown. Reception, appearances in other media and merchandising In 2004, the Eds also appeared in a short series of basketball commercials with NBA All-Star Steve Francis. All three Eds have been the main roles in four Ed, Edd n Eddy- based video games, including Ed, Edd n Eddy: Jawbreakers! (2002), Ed, Edd n Eddy: Giant Jawbreakers (2004), Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures (2005), and Ed, Edd n Eddy: Scam of the Century (2007), as well as appearing as playable characters in a number of Cartoon Network-based video games, including 2003's Cartoon Network: Block Party and Cartoon Network Speedway. All three Eds appear as Non-playable characters in the MMOG Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall. They also appear as Nanos (items that help the user or his/her party). The Eds and Sarah have also been free toys in children's meals for Subway. The three have also appeared on a number of Ed, Edd n Eddy T-shirts available for purchase on the Cartoon Network Shop. A series of Ed, Edd n Eddy DVDs have been released. The three have made a cameo appearance in a Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode, along with Dexter of Dexter's Laboratory, and in a crossover of The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Codename: Kids Next Door entitled \\"The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door.\\" Ed appeared in the \\"Cartoon Network Elections 2004\\" with Grim from The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy as a team, and they ended up winning, due to the highest number of votes by viewers.

The Rainmen were replaced in late 2015 by the Halifax Hurricanes, based in the Scotiabank Centre. Rumours of a Canadian Football League team have been around for decades, with one team, the Atlantic Schooners, existing only on paper. The Halifax Regional Municipality has considered lobbying to have a CFL team located in the area, though the proposal has never been formally endorsed by the municipal or provincial governments. Huskies Stadium hosted Touchdown Atlantic, a CFL exhibition game, in 2005, and planned to host another in 2006, but the suspension of one of the scheduled teams forced the cancellation of the game. The Nova Scotia Keltics play in the Rugby Canada Super League. On September 13, 2018 the National Lacrosse League announced it would be expanding into Halifax for the 2019-20 season. Major tournaments HRM has hosted the World Junior Hockey Championships, as well as the Brier and Tournament of Hearts curling championships.

Canada Games The Emera Oval, built for the 2011 Canada Games In 1969, the then cities of Halifax and Dartmouth hosted the first edition of the Canada Summer Games. In preparation for the games the cities built a range of new sports venues, including a softball facility, the paddling course at Lake Banook, and the first Olympic-size swimming pool in Atlantic Canada, the Centennial Pool. In February 2011, the city hosted the 2011 Canada Winter Games. Several new facilities were built for the games, including the Canada Games Centre and the Emera Oval. The skating oval, originally intended to be temporary, proved very popular with the public and was made a permanent fixture on the Halifax Common. 2014 Commonwealth Games bid Halifax was selected as the Canadian bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, beating other Canadian municipalities such as Hamilton, Ontario, York Regional Municipality, Ontario, and Ottawa, Ontario. The estimated costs for the games in Halifax were projected at C$800 million, to which the federal government committed $400 million in the fall of 2006. Leaked information projected these costs could escalate to $1.6 billion as the bid committee prepared for submitting the final bid information in May 2007 to the Commonwealth Games Federation. A major cost was projected to be the construction of a 50,000 seat stadium and sports complex, including an athlete's village, on former Department of National Defence property at Shannon Park on the Dartmouth waterfront. Officials had estimated these facilities would cost $163 million alone. Shannon Park was chosen as the most suitable location since it is situated on the Halifax Harbour where proposed high speed ferries could connect to other parts of Bedford Basin and the downtown central business district, as well as being situated astride several major highways and a rail line. On March 8, 2007 the provincial and municipal governments issued a joint statement withdrawing Halifax from the bidding process for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, citing the projected costs to public finances and lack of available funding. Halifax's withdrawal left two remaining bids under consideration: Abuja, Nigeria and Glasgow, United Kingdom. The Commonwealth Games Federation announced at a meeting in Sri Lanka on November 9, 2007 that Glasgow would host the 2014 Games.

He feared that a failure of Britain and the United States to reach an agreement, regardless of the other countries involved, would lead to a dangerous competition in shipbuilding between both countries that would seriously jeopardise world peace:\\"Sees Peace at Stake in London Conference\\", New York Times, Jan. 8, 1930 \\"Each country should build the ships it needs without regarding the other navy as a possible enemy\\".\\"Urges Cooperation in Naval Relations\\", New York Times, August 4, 1929 A year and a half after the war in Europe had begun and after the German bombing of London had continued, Cazalet urged the American government to keep the life line between their countries open. \\"The victory can be won,\\" he emphasised, \\"if the stuff gets over\\".\\"American Aid Called Essential\\", Los Angeles Times, May 17, 1941 p. 7 He added that Britain was deeply grateful for the help they had already received from the US. Advocating Jewish homeland Cazalet had become chairman of the House of Commons Palestine Committee and described the plight of Britain under siege as connected to that of the Jews who were being driven from Europe by the Nazis. During a speech to the committee in May 1941, he explained that they had the same aims: In Cazalet's opinion, it was in the best interest of the British Empire to establish a Jewish state in Palestine.\\"Palestine Victory Campaign\\", The Guardian (London), 29 July 1941 p. 3 However, although Jews were also victims of Nazi aggression, they were still not recognised as allies of Britain. \\"England,\\" he said, \\"may have made many mistakes, but today she represents something above and beyond material possessions\\".\\"Palestine Is Held Example of Unity\\", New York Times, April 29, 1941 Although he never knew his grandfather, Edward Cazalet, the latter had first inspired his interest in establishing a Jewish state. An industrialist based in Russia, Edward had written a number of treatises in the 1870s in which he advocated a Jewish homeland and wrote that \\"under English protection the Jewish nation, after eighteen hundred years of exile, would have it in their power to return again to their own country\\".Cazalet, Edward. The Eastern Question: An Address to Working Men, Edward Stanford (London) 1878 According to Cazalet biographer Robert Rhodes James, Edward Cazalet had seen the pogroms against the Jews in the Russian Empire, and their plight made a \\"profound emotional appeal to him\\". He also recognised the spiritual aspect: Victor Cazalet's actual involvement in promoting the Jewish state began with the guidance of Lord Arthur Balfour, however, and Cazalet's friendship with Chaim Weizmann. Cazalet wrote, \\"Lord Balfour's devotion to the cause of Jewry will be recognised wherever Jews are to be found in this world\\". Weizmann tried to apply the feelings by championing the idea of creating a separate Jewish army that would support Britain's fight against Germany. In 1942, Cazalet called upon the British government to grant the Jewish Agency's request to create a fighting force of 20,000 Jewish soldiers and a home guard of 50,000 to be made an integral part of the British Army.The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, August 14, 1942 p. 1 His efforts failed, however. At a 1941 conference in the United States in which he was joined by Sikorski, Cazalet advocated forgetting differences and \\"uniting all forces in an effort to defeat the enemy\\". He saw the struggle in Palestine as setting an example for the rest of the world. \\"Although the war has held up our program as far as Palestine is concerned, in God's good time the Jewish State will be established and it will contribute as much happiness and prosperity to the Arab as to the Jew.\\" During a speech in April 1941, Cazalet stated: On 27 June 1943, a week before he was killed, he had visited Cairo and then Jerusalem, where he met with David Ben-Gurion and others. His last public statements recorded were at that meeting in which he said, \\"I would gladly give my life for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, as I am ready to give my life for the preservation of the British Empire.... Whatever happens, the Jews must have a permanent home\\". Death and legacy After serving in the House of Commons for nineteen years, he was considered one of the \\"most brilliant\\" of the younger men in the Commons. \\"His knowledge of central Europe was probably unequaled,\\" wrote the New York Times after his sudden death in 1943, at age 46, when his plane crashed seconds after take off from Gibraltar. The plane, a B-24 Liberator II LB-30 AL523 was also carrying General Sikorski and fellow Conservative MP Brigadier John Whiteley; Sikorski, Whiteley and everyone else on board (except for first pilot Eduard Prchal)--sixteen in all--died in the crash. The circumstances surrounding the unexplained accident have led to various controversies and allegations of sabotage. Cazalet's family received a flood of tributes, many from unknown admirers and others from notables, including Churchill, Anthony Eden, Eleanor Rathbone, Hugh Dalton and Polish dignitaries. Chaim Weizmann speaking at a memorial ceremony in London, described Cazalet as \\"one of the few precious friends of the Jewish people in modern times who never was moved from his devotion to the (Zionist) cause.\\" He said that his grave at Gibraltar would become a place of pilgrimage for the Jewish people, while Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, agreed to plant 1,000 trees in Palestine to be named the \\"Victor Cazalet Grove.\\"\\"Dr. Weizmann Mourns Cazalet\\", The Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle, July 23, 1943 p. 1 A lead article in the New York Herald Tribune read: Personal life Cazalet, who was known to be gay https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-10-21/debates/DD6089AE-523C-4707-9773-4262BB9415BD/SexualOffences(PardonsEtc)Bill https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/camp-history-westminsters-queer- mps, was a Christian Scientist and a lay preacher at Ninth Church of Christ, Scientist, London.Christian Science Sentinel, 20 June 1931 issue He was a landowner and a wealthy bachelor, whose numerous social and political connections included close friendships with Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden.

He also played tennis competitively, including seven appearances at Wimbledon between 1922 and 1933.Capt.

She married journalist David Keir in August 1939.\\"Thelma Cazalet Engaged: British Conservative M.P.

Wodehouse's daughter, Leonora, was a notable racehorse trainer who was British jump racing Champion Trainer three times and trained Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's racehorses. Godfather to Elizabeth Taylor Cazalet, who had a passion for fine art, became a close friend of American art gallery owners Francis Taylor and his wife Sara, parents of Elizabeth, after they had moved from the U.S. to London in 1936. Cazalet let the Taylor family, who were also Christian Scientists, spend their weekends in a separate 16th century cottage on his estate in Kent. He wanted them to think of England as their new home.Walker, Alexander. Elizabeth: The Life of Elizabeth Taylor, Grove Press (1990) He gave 4-year-old Elizabeth a horse named Betty as a gift, which she would ride bareback throughout the property. The Taylors asked him to be her godfather, after which he became an important influence during her early life. At one time while Elizabeth suffered the first of many near-fatal illnesses, Elizabeth begged her mother to \\"please call Victor and ask him to come and sit with me.\\" Cazalet then drove ninety miles through thick fog to be at her side. When he arrived, recalled her mother, \\"Victor sat on the bed and held Elizabeth in his arms and talked to her about God,\\" and soon after the fever had broken. At a lunch with Churchill in April 1939, Cazalet learned that a war was coming, and was permitted by Churchill to inform others. Cazalet, concerned for the Taylor family's safety, urged Francis to close his art gallery as soon as possible and return with his family to America. Because of the time needed to vacate the gallery, he suggested that Sara and his children should be sent back alone where Francis could later join them. They took his advice and eventually ended up in Los Angeles where he established a new gallery. As Cazalet was an acquaintance of screen actor DeWolf Hopper and his former wife, Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, he sent a letter of introduction on behalf of Elizabeth to Ms. Hopper, to help 7-year-old Elizabeth become involved in acting.\\"The Making of a Goddess\\", The Observer (London), 23, October 1977 p. 25-26 Hopper met with Elizabeth and Sara and offered to help. Months later, Cazalet wrote in his diary for 16 April 1941, \\"Imagine excitement of Taylors. Elizabeth has a contract for seven years with a big cinema group.\\"  Other reading  *  Notes   References  CricketArchive profile for Victor Cazelet **Daily Telegraph [London] 23MAR2011.

The legend of Johnny Kaw was created in 1955 by George Filinger, a professor of horticulture at Kansas State University, to celebrate the centennial of Manhattan, Kansas. The stories were initially printed in the city newspaper, The Manhattan Mercury, during the centennial and later collected into a self-published book by Filinger, who created Kaw to be Kansas' answer to other heroes like Bunyan and Pecos Bill. Elmer Tomasch of the Kansas State University Art Department provided ink drawings to illustrate the stories and the book. Fiilinger's stories related how Johnny Kaw created the Kansas landscape, geography and pioneer trails. Kaw was said to have dug the Kansas River Valley, planted wheat, invented sunflowers, and grown giant potatoes. Kaw even controlled the weather, lopping the funnels off tornadoes and wringing out the clouds to end droughts. His pets were the mascots for the two state universities: a wildcat and a jayhawk, who enjoyed a good fight. The Dust Bowl was said to be a result of their fights. Filinger's book was not republished after 1969, but Kansas author Jerri Garretson released a children's picture book about Johnny Kaw in 1997. Her book was illustrated by another KSU art instructor, Diane A. Dollar. A color edition of the book was published in September 2011 and the original B&W; version was included in the 2008 anthology, \\"Kansas Tall Tales.\\" Statue A statue of Johnny Kaw holding a scythe stands in the city park in Manhattan, Kansas .

Stranger anxiety and stranger fear are two interchangeable terms. Stranger anxiety is a typical part of the developmental sequence that most children experience. It can occur even if the child is with a caregiver or another person they trust.Stranger anxiety It peaks from six to 12 months but may recur afterwards until the age of 24 months.What to Expect. Toddler Stranger Anxiety. As a child gets older, stranger anxiety can be a problem as they begin to socialize. Children may become hesitant to play with unfamiliar children. Foster children are especially at risk, particularly if they experienced neglect early in their life. The anxiety children experience when meeting a stranger is based on the sensation of fear they develop when introduced to an unfamiliar factor in their life that elicits the feeling of fear. They are not born with the awareness that meeting a stranger for the first time will cause them to be fearful. The child discovers this feeling when facing the stimulus, in this case a stranger, for the first time. Experiencing fear causes toddlers to sense they are in a potentially threatened position and therefore, they go towards their caregiver in order to seek protection from the stranger. This reaction enables children to develop instincts to guide them when they feel endangered and seek the protection of a familiar and trusted individual to ensure their safety and survival. The stimuli which provoke a child's anxiety in the presence of a stranger are influenced by the individual's age, gender and his or her distance from the toddler. When a child is in the company of an unknown child, they are less frightened than if they were with an unknown adult. This is due to the height of the individual. The taller the person, the more frightening they seem. In addition, children are more fearful of a stranger when they are standing in close proximity to them, while their caregiver is farther away or completely out of their sight. The gender of the stranger contributes to the level of anxiety a child experiences. When in the presence of a male, the child feels more anxious than in front of a female. The anxiety a child feels when facing a stranger is based on various fears that arise in them. A few of these are based on the actions the stranger could unexpectedly take. For example, the child worries they can be taken away from their caregiver or harmed. The fear of the unknown elicits the anxiety. Although anxiety can go away in few minutes, it could also last a long time. As children reach the age of two, their feelings of anxiety in the presence of strangers are nearly gone. However, some children can still experience apprehension up until the age of four. It is less probable for toddlers to experience anxiety in the presence of a stranger if a figure they trust, such as their caregivers, perform positive interactions with this person. For example, they employ a calm tone of voice, they smile and hug the stranger. This enables the child to feel a certain reassurance seeing that their caregiver does not show any sign of fear in the presence of this individual. Onset Stranger anxiety develops slowly; it does not just appear suddenly. It typically first starts to appear around four months of age with infants behaving differently with caregivers than with strangers. In fact, there is a difference between their interactions with their caregiver and the stranger. They become cautious when strangers are around; therefore, preferring to be with their caregiver instead of the stranger. Around 7‚Äì8 months, stranger anxiety becomes more present; therefore, it occurs more frequently at this point. Infants start to be aware of their environment and they are aware of their relationships with people; so, stranger anxiety is clearly displayed. Around this time, children choose and prefer to be with their primary caregiver. As a child's cognitive skills develop and improve, typically around 12 months, their stranger anxiety can become more intense. They display behaviors like running to their caregiver, grabbing at the caregiver's legs, or demanding to be picked up. Children seem also to respond more positively to a person who gives positive reinforcements and more negatively to a person who gives negative reinforcements. Fearfulness within the sight of outsiders is thought to be developed around 6 months of age. In fact, that fear of strangers increases throughout their first year of life. The beginning of stranger fear is accepted to be adaptive, offering balance to infants‚Äô tendencies toward approach and exploration and adding to the developing attachment system. However, in extreme cases of stranger fear, this can be a warning sign to the emergence of social anxiety. According to the University of Pittsburgh, stranger anxiety tends to be seen before separation anxiety. thumb|360x360pxInfants may be afraid of strangers  Signs of stranger anxiety  According to the University of Pittsburgh based on the child, signs of stranger anxiety can differ from one to child the other. For example; # In the presence of a stranger, some infants can abruptly go quiet and look at the stranger with fear. # Certain emotions will increase in other children while in the presence of a stranger such as loud crying and fussiness. # And others will have the tendency to bury themselves in their caregiver's arms or even place themselves away from the stranger by placing the caregiver between themselves and the stranger.  Modeling and stranger anxiety   Infancy  Parental attitudes also have an effect on a child's fear acquisition. In their early months and years, infants acquire most of their behavioral information for their direct family and often, their primary caregivers. Young infants are more selective and preferentially learn about new threats for their mother's responses. High risk mothers can easily influence their child's responses since are more likely to mimic their actions. For example, a child who sees their mother demonstrating negative reactions towards a specific person, then the child is more likely to have a negative response towards that same person. While most studies have researched the effect of mothers' behaviors on their children, it is important to note that the effect of parental modeling is not unique to mothers, but the phenomenon occurs for both mothers and fathers. = Implications = Fear beliefs that occur vicariously can be reversed using the same form of acquisition through a vicarious counter-conditioning procedure. For example, a parent can show a stranger's angry face with happy face or a scared-paired animal with happy faces as well and vice versa. Also, feared responses seem to decrease with time if infants are provided with opportunities to have physical contact with the stimuli which helps alleviate the stimuli's fearful properties.  Childhood  Stranger fear is less likely in older children (i.e. at least six years old) since there is a greater readiness for them to accept behavioral information from outside the family. However, studies show that older children do exhibit increased anxiety to new threats and avoidant responses following discussion with parents. The effect of parental modeling of anxiety on children may go beyond influencing anxious behaviors in children, but also affect their subjective feelings and cognition during middle childhood. = Implications = This has important implications for parents and those working with school-age children because it suggests that they can potentially prevent or reverse fear developing if they recognize a child is involved in a fear-related vicarious learning event. In cases where infants become fearful of strangers or unknown entities (such as foreign objects), parents should respond positively towards the stranger, only after the child has a phobic response to it. Dealing with stranger anxiety Since stranger anxiety can manifest itself suddenly or happen gradually throughout the development of the toddler, dealing with it can be hard sometimes because people are often not prepared to react to it or they don't even know what stranger anxiety is. Stranger anxiety should be viewed as a normal, common part of a child's development. Since it is often characterized by negative emotions and fear, multiple steps were created to induct a feeling of trust and safety between the child and the strangers. thumb|334x334pxThe child's feelings should always be valued *Addressing the issue with the stranger ahead of time, so that they can learn to approach the child slowly, giving them time to warm up. The stranger should be informed of the child's fear, so they are not hurt when the child reacts negatively to them. *Holding child's hand when they are introduced to new people has been found to be a good way to create a feeling of trust between them and the stranger. *Frequently introducing children to new people. Taking them to places where they might interact with strangers. *Being patient when a fearful situation shows up will be crucial. If rushed, child can become even more sensitive. *Gradually bringing new babysitters or child-care workers into the child's life. *Showing understanding of the fears of children should be priority number one. Ignoring or dismissing these feelings will only aggravate the problem. *Above all, the child's feelings should always be valued more than the strangers'. Patience and respect are very important when dealing with stranger anxiety. A child should never be labeled or ridiculed for being frightened. Extreme anxiety can affect development, especially if a child is so terrified that they will not explore new environments and hinder themselves from learning. Also, research shows that exposure to circumstances that produce persistent fear and chronic anxiety can have a lifelong effect on a child's brain by disrupting its developing architecture. While stranger anxiety is a normal part of child development, if it becomes so severe that it restricts normal life professional help might be necessary. Seeking the help of a pediatrician is recommended if the situation doesn't improve, or even regresses in time. Often, pediatricians will be able to find the origin of the anxiety suffered by the child and create a plan of action in order to rectify the situation.  Stranger anxiety and autism spectrum disorder  According to the American Psychiatric Association, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as ‚Äúa developmental disorder characterized by troubles with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior‚Äù. There is a significant overlap between the behaviors that characterize ASD and those observed in stranger anxiety, which makes diagnoses and research more difficult. However, individuals with ASD often have a rigid understanding of the world and behave in a very rule-based and compartmentalized manner, depending on their placement on the spectrum. Thus, the social interactions and stranger approaches seen in children are often modeled from their caretakers and are based on the rules they are told.  Modelling in stranger anxiety in ASD  Children with developmentally appropriate behavior also model their parents‚Äô behavior and can exhibit stranger anxiety until about they are six years old, but children with ASD have difficulty accepting behavioral information and understanding how to behave with certain people and strangers. Thus, if caretakers/parents demonstrate negative behavior, like facial expressions, verbal communications, or physical retractions, towards strangers, children with autism will often imitate this behavior. Although children with ASD often have difficulty with imitation, children are often taught that strangers are ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù. Moreover, if caretakers teach children with autism that strangers are unsafe, they will demonstrate stranger anxiety and have difficulty understanding otherwise as they grow. For example, caretakers may teach children to never speak to strangers, but children with ASD will understand this literally and may fear and be anxious around all strangers.  Strategies  Therefore, it is crucial to appropriately teach children with autism who they may expect to meet in a given location and situation and what those people look like, in order for them to be self- sufficient and not anxious wherever they are. Individuals with ASD need to understand not only who they should be interacting with in the community, but also what the expected behaviors are during these interactions. Moreover, caretakers/parents are cautioned to not reinforce negative reactions when strangers are seen and to teach ‚Äústranger danger‚Äù precariously. Thus, children with autism should be taught strategies that slightly differ than a developmentally appropriate child. One example of a strategy is the Circles Program, which color coordinates individuals that a child may encounter by titling them in different colored circles and outlining the expected social boundaries with these people. Another strategy used for children with ASD and stranger anxiety is to use social stories, this includes pictures and audio tapes which makes understanding possible changes they may encounter with strangers. Stranger terror thumb|480x480pxChild afraid of new women in classroom Stranger terror is extremely severe stranger anxiety that inhibits the child's normal functioning. The DSM- V describes stranger terror as infants with a reactive attachment disorder, inhibited type and do not respond to or initiate contact with others, but rather show extreme trepidation and ambivalence about unknown adults. Anxiety and fear around strangers usually appears around six months of age and it slowly increases throughout the first year of life. This increase in stranger anxiety correlates with the same time as when the child starts crawling, walking and exploring its surroundings. The age of the child seems to play an important role in the development of stranger terror in infants. Older infants (i.e. at least 12 months) seem to be more affected than younger infants because their cognitive development to know and remember has matured more than younger infants and their attachment to caregivers is stronger than younger infants. Stranger anxiety and stranger terror is associated to the Attachment Theory, to the attachment to caregiver. Seen across different species, attachment increases the chances of the infant's survival in the world. In a research conducted by Tyrrell and Dozier (1997), they found that infants in foster care show more attachment-related difficulties than control infants in their families. Those foster children were sometimes unsoothable after the contact or even just the presence of a stranger. There have been hypotheses that for these infants the appearance of the stranger represented a potential loss of the new attachment figure and it was the fear of re-experiencing this loss that prompted their behavior. Those children with stranger anxiety will rarely go beyond their caregiver to explore their surroundings. Stranger terror elicits strong reactions from children as described below, most likely due to the degree of traumatic event which causes their strong reactions such as the loss of a mother. In order to cope with attachment-related traumas, children suffering from stranger terror develop abnormal means of coping with these events by viewing all adults as threatening and avoiding contact with everyone, for example.  Strange situation  In a Strange Situation experiment, a child of the age of 20 months was in a room with their mother and a stranger would enter. The child would go hide behind the legs of the mother. The mother was then asked to leave the room and leave the child with the stranger. After the first separation, the child began to scream and was extremely upset. He refused all contact with the stranger and when the adult tried to pick up the child he would scream louder until put back down. Any attempts by the stranger to sooth the child was unsuccessful. When the mother came back in the room for the first reunion, the child somewhat calmed down, but he was still very upset and distressed. For the second part of the experiment, the child was left alone in the room for a couple of minutes before the stranger entered again. The second the stranger entered the room the child began crying loudly again even if no contact was made. To conclude, although resistance to a stranger is common for children, the extreme reactions was far more urgent and depicted terror. In addition, most babies in the experiment show some evidence of settling when the stranger enters the room the second time. In contrast, children with stranger terror showed an increase in distress upon the stranger's entry. thumb|336x336pxChildren go and hide when a stranger enters their home  Some signs of stranger terror  *Fleeing when a person they don't know enters their home, even if they aren‚Äôt interacting with the child. *Worried facial expressions that are typically seen on an older child. *Being very upset by a stranger's presence, even in the child's own home. *Loud screaming or arching of the back when an unfamiliar person tries to comfort or hold the child. *Being silent or wary for longer than normal periods with fearful facial expressions.

When the F-16 hit the ground, its momentum carried the wreckage westward through the right wing of a C-141B Starlifter (AF Ser. No. 66-0173 of the 438th Airlift Wing, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey) parked on the ramp. The C-141B crew was preparing the aircraft for joint Army-Air Force operations; however, no Army troops besides the jumpmaster team had yet boarded it. The wreckage of the F-16 punctured the fuel tanks in the C-141's right wing, causing a large fireball, which combined with the F-16 wreckage and continued on a path taking it between Building 900 and the pax shed, directly into the area where the mass of Army paratroopers were sitting and standing. Twenty-three men died and more than eighty were injured; one severely burned paratrooper died more than nine months later, on 3 January 1995. Paratroopers at the scene pulled troopers from the flames and the exploding ammunition from the F-16. First upon the scene were vehicles and medics from the Army's Delta Force, which was based adjacent to Green Ramp. Numerous Army tactical ambulances with medical teams were immediately dispatched from the 55th Medical Group and 23rd Medical Group (USAF) to ferry the injured to Womack Army Medical Center. These medics were among the first upon the scene and provided assistance after notification to MSG Richard Young of the 44th Medical Brigade Operations at Fort Bragg by a cell phone call from SFC Juan Gonzales at HQ, 44th Medical Brigade who was awaiting an airborne jump at Pope AFB.MSG Young and SFC Gonzales, 44th Med Bde FY 1994 Annual Report Others were transported to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayetteville, and others were flown to the UNC Hospitals' Burn Center in Chapel Hill.http://www.fayobserver.com/8bdbe029-b379-52b9-b138-9527631cfb30.html Aftermath USAF firefighters drag hoses in front of the C-141 Starlifter destroyed during the disaster. President Clinton visited the site two days after the incident and met with the injured at Womack at Fort Bragg. Several of the more severely burned victims were taken to the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research at Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas. Two months after the accident, only one paratrooper remained critical, while the others were either in satisfactory condition or convalescing at home. A subsequent U.S. Air Force investigation placed most of the blame for the accident on the military and civilian air traffic controllers working Pope air traffic that day. The Air Force investigation identified \\"multiple causes\\" for the midair collision, faulting air traffic control for the \\"majority of errors.\\" Although the F-16 pilot was partly to blame because he did not \\"see and avoid and stay well clear of the mishap C-130,\\" as required by Air Force regulations, there were extenuating circumstances. The pilot testified that he did not see the C-130; however, after the control tower had made him aware of its presence, he began executing a low approach, when the collision occurred. Two Air Force officers involved in the crash were relieved of duty and transferred to other jobs. Three enlisted men also were disciplined. One of the enlisted controllers was later subject to Article 15 action. A later investigation stated that pilot error by the F-16 pilots also contributed to the mishap, but no disciplinary action was taken against the pilots.

A professor at Yale Law School, Bittker was a prolific author, writing many textbooks and over one hundred articles on tax law. Born in Rochester, New York, Bittker attended Cornell University ('38) and Yale Law School ('41). After law school, Bittker clerked for Judge Jerome Frank of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. From 1942 to 43 Bittker worked as an attorney for the Lend-Lease Administration in Washington, D.C. During the next two years Bittker fought and was wounded in World War II, receiving a Purple Heart. Returning from Europe, Bittker went back to government service, working for the Office of the Alien Property Custodian. Bittker reluctantly returned to his alma mater as an assistant professor in 1946. Eventually he gained tenure in 1951, became a Southmayd Professor in 1958, and Sterling Professor of Law in 1970. By the time Bittker retired from teaching in 1983 to pursue scholarship full-time, his was one of the most recognizable names on the illustrious roster of Yale's faculty. In 1973, Bittker wrote The Case for Black Reparations, inspired by SNCC leader James Forman, who in 1969 interrupted a church service to demand reparations for slavery. Bittker defended the spirit of Forman's appeal, but argued that a reparations lawsuit for school segregation had a stronger legal basis. Bittker was also a dedicated environmentalist, serving as a trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Bittker was married to Anne (died on February 2, 1997) and had two children, Susan and Daniel. Publications (selection)   References  *Yale Law School obituary *YLS Mourns Death of Boris I.

Both had been members of a beat group, The Way We Live since 1966. They are notable both for their appreciation by John Peel and Julian Cope, but also for their longevity because as of 2007, they were still performing. The band was produced initially by schoolfriend sound engineer John Brierley. Early history In the early days, the main marketing tool of unsigned hopeful bands was to send demo tapes. Accordingly, a tape was sent by John Brierley to Elektra Records part of the CBS group. Clive Selwood was the CBS UK operations manager and he listened to the tape and liked what he heard. He and his partner DJ John Peel signed the band to their Dandelion Records label. Peel had a fondness for Rochdale, having worked in a cotton mill there before becoming a DJ. Clive Selwood came to Rochdale to sign up the band. The group was booked into London's Spot Studios and finished the sessions within two days, and in January 1971 the band's debut album, A Candle for Judith was released, credited to The Way We Live. The release, named after Clayton's then girlfriend, later wife, earned immediate critical acclaim \\"...impeccable in both technique and emotion\\"... Al Clark writing in Time Out in London in 1971. Meanwhile, Peel bought the band recording equipment and a stereo PA system. He also convinced the band to change their name. Looking out of his kitchen window at Peel Acres in Suffolk, he spied a tractor in the fields adjacent to his house and recommended it as a name to them. Tractor's first release after the name change from The Way We Live was a 7-inch maxi single ‚Äì \\"Stoney Glory\\"/\\"Marie\\"/\\"As You Say\\"‚Äîfor Dandelion. They also backed up another Dandelion act ‚Äì Beau ‚Äî on his Creation album (1971). All of this recording was done in an attic and bedroom studio of a terraced house in Edenfield Road Rochdale, which John Peel named Dandelion Studios, Rochdale to tie in with his record label Dandelion Records. The duo's first full-length follow-up was released in 1972. By January 1973, the album was earning positive reviews. Melody Maker stated \\"albums don't come any better than this\\", Bob Harris, Anne Nightingale on BBC Radio 1 and Kid Jensen on Radio Luxembourg, all gave airplay to the album and it climbed to 18 in the Radio Luxembourg album charts, and to 30 in the Virgin Bestseller charts. Sound engineer John Brierley was eventually replaced by former The Way We Live singer Alan Burgess and, along with Chris Hewitt who would eventually manage the band, Milne, and Clayton, the group began building a studio in Dawson Street, Market Street Heywood, Lancashire, named Tractor Sound Studios, again partially financed by John Peel. This studio would feature in a BBC film about Rochdale, Heywood, and John Peel, when the band and Chris Hewitt revisited the studio in December 2006. In September 2009, the location of Tractor Sound Studios was celebrated with a blue plaque as a testimonial to the members of Tractor and John Peel. Unveiled by Steve Clayton, Peter Hook-Joy Division/New Order), Rev Mike Huck and Chris Hewitt The plaque is mounted on the front of the building. The part finished third album for Dandelion, which was to be eventually released in the 1990s as Worst Enemies, was recorded at both Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Oxfordshire and Tractor Sound Studios, Heywood. Tractor eventually left the Dandelion label, which had effectively ceased to operate for about 17 years in 1973-confirmed by John Peel's article on Dandelion ceasing for a while in 1973 After Dandelion Tractor then recorded a single in their Heywood studio, the reggae-tinged \\"Roll the Dice\\", released on Jonathan King's UK Records label. In the summer of 1976, Milne and Clayton and manager Chris Hewitt recruited bassist Dave Addison and teamed up again with studio engineer John Brierley, now the owner of Cargo Recording Studios at that point based in his house on Drake Street. They recorded another single \\"No More Rock 'n' Roll\\" / \\"Northern City\\", which was issued on Cargo Records of Rochdale and made the newly invented NME Indie singles chart. It also appeared on the 1977 punk compilation LP, Streets. The \\"No More Rock'n'Roll\\"single was released to coincide with the 1977 Deeply Vale Festival, a North West England music festival of the 1970s which the band were heavily involved in. At this point Tractor Music- PA Company and Music shop moved into premises along with Cargo Studios on Kenion Street, Rochdale. The whole street became a music complex during the 1970s to the 1990s with many well known bands including Joy Division buying equipment here and hiring PA's from Tractor Music and recording in Cargo Studios, A blue plaque was put on Tractor's building in Rochdale in 2009 to celebrate its use as Cargo Studios, Tractor Music and Suite Sixteen Studios. In 1980, Milne, Clayton, and Addison entered the studio, this time adding blind musician Tony Crabtree on keyboards/guitar. They recorded another single ‚Äì \\"Average Man's Hero\\" / \\"Big Big Boy\\" ‚Äì this one for Roach Records, which was a label run by the band themselves. The band started live concerts and recording again in 2001 with the two piece original line up of Jim Milne and Steve Clayton. Recent history As recently as 2004, Julian Cope has given Tractor and their first album favourable attention. The band issued CDs on numerous labels from 1991 before starting their own company in 1996, Ozit Morpheus Records, which has now reissued their entire back catalogue. Tractor began performing live again in 2001 (just the original duo of Jim Milne and Steve Clayton) and have become a regular festival band playing both Glastonbury and Canterbury festivals. In 2004 Tractor took part and provided music for an ITV documentary, Truly, Madly, Deeply Vale. This was released as an extended DVD, Deeply Vale Festivals in July 2007. BBC Television also showed a short documentary on Tractor in January 2007. Tractor spent 2007 and 2008 in the studio recording additional material for a new extended version of their album about the Peterloo Massacre which was eventually released in August 2011. The new double LP Townhead Mill was released in late 2012. Steve Clayton published his first novel The Art of Being Dead.

Life and career Getty was born in Louisiana and grew up in Oklahoma. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and his Ph.D. from Boston College in 1979. Getty was a professor at the University of California, Riverside before moving to UCLA. Getty is a John Simon Guggenheim Fellow, a Research Fellow of the Russian State University for the Humanities (Moscow), and has been Senior Fellow of the Harriman Institute (Columbia University) and the Davis Center (Harvard University). He was Senior Visiting Scholar at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Research and ideas The traditional approach to the Soviet history claimed it was a totalitarian system, with the personality cult and the almost unlimited powers of the \\"great leader\\". These ideas were challenged later by historians, one of whom was Getty. In his book, Origins of Great Purges published in 1985, Getty argued that the Soviet political system was not completely controlled from the center, and that Stalin only responded to political events as they arose. The book was a challenge to works by Robert Conquest. In an appendix to the book, Getty also questioned the previously published findings that Stalin organized himself the murder of Sergey Kirov to justify his campaign of Great Terror. Regarding the 1936 Soviet Constitution, Getty wrote: > Many who lauded Stalin's Soviet Union as the most democratic country on > earth lived to regret their words. After all, the Soviet Constitution of > 1936 was adopted on the eve of the Great Terror of the late 1930s; the > \\"thoroughly democratic\\" elections to the first Supreme Soviet permitted only > uncontested candidates and took place at the height of the savage violence > in 1937.

Arch Getty. (1991). \\"State > and Society Under Stalin: Constitutions and Elections in the 1930s\\". Slavic > Review. Vol. 50. No. 1. pp. 18‚Äî35. Other historians criticized work by Getty as apologetics for Stalin and accused them of downplaying the terror.

Amendment 41's \\"gift ban\\" places new restrictions on gifts, broadly defined, given to Colorado state and local elected officials and employees in executive and legislative branches. Such persons are prohibited from receiving gifts with value exceeding $53 per year, subject to an adjustment for inflation. Gifts from lobbyists are banned regardless of amount. There are several exceptions to the gift ban, including an exception for gifts given between personal friends and relatives on special occasions and another for travel paid for by non-profits that receive less than 5% of their revenue from corporate donations or by other state or local governments. Amendment 41's \\"anti-revolving door\\" provision prohibits statewide elected officeholders from lobbying certain state elected officials for pay for two years after leaving office. Finally, Amendment 41 creates the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission. Four members of the Commission are appointed by the State House, State Senate, Governor and the Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court. The fifth member must be an official or employee of a local government and is selected by the other four members. Members serve staggered four-year terms and receive no salary. No more than two Commissioners may be members of the same political party.Colo. Const., art. XXIX, sec. 5. The Ethics Commission issues advisory opinions and letter rulings to covered individuals or others asking whether a proposed course of conduct would violate Amendment 41 or any other ethical standard of conduct or reporting requirement. The Ethics Commission is also required to investigate and hold a hearing on all non-frivolous complaints alleging violations of the gift ban, the anti-revolving door provision, or any other standard of conduct or reporting requirement in state law.Colo. Const. art. XXIX, sec. 5; Colorado Independent Ethics Commission Ethics Handbook 2013-15, http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/DPA-IEC/IEC/1251588143132/ The Ethics Commission was originally placed in the Colorado Department of Personnel and Administration. In June 2010, it was moved to the Judicial Branch.Colorado House Bill 10-1404.  Legal reactions  The state legislature, in the same legislation stating its interpretation of the initiative, asked the Colorado Supreme Court to resolve the dispute over the constitutionality of this implementing legislation, but it declined to act. A state trial court of general jurisdiction in Denver, Colorado issued a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of Amendment 41 on U.S. constitutional grounds in 2007. The state court in this case issued a preliminary injunction banning enforcement of the gift ban on First Amendment grounds during the pendency of the litigation. On appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court, the preliminary injunction was then vacated on February 25, 2008, on the grounds that the suit was not ripe prior to the organization of the independent ethics commission, without reaching the merits of the constitutionality of Amendment 41 . In 2008, then-Secretary of State Mike Coffman filed suit in Denver District Court against the Ethics Commission, attempting to block an inquiry into whether he permitted employees in his office to run outside private businesses using government data. After the Commission found that he was not aware of such activities, the legal challenge was dropped. In 2008, Colorado Ethics Watch filed suit in Denver District Court against the Ethics Commission for failing to make documents regarding advisory opinion requests, letter ruling requests and non-frivolous complaints available for inspection under the Colorado Open Records Act. The case resulted in an order requiring documents to be made public and an award of attorneys' fees. In 2009, The Colorado Independent filed suit in Denver District Court against the Ethics Commission for violating Colorado's Open Meetings Law by deciding the complaint against Mike Coffman behind closed doors. The case resulted in an order for production of executive session tapes and an award of attorneys' fees. After these two legal losses, the Ethics Commission took steps to improve its compliance with Colorado's transparency laws. In 2013, Secretary of State Scott Gessler filed suit against the Ethics Commission, arguing that Amendment 41 is impermissibly vague and that the Commission's hearing process violates due process. The case has not been decided.  Proposed constitutional amendments  Amendment 41 supporters proposed a clarifying citizen initiative aimed at the November 2007 ballot, which escapes a usual ban on non-fiscal citizen initiatives at odd numbered elections by including a tax on lobbyists to finance the implementation of Amendment 41. But, this proposal was invalidated by the body that oversees the initiative process in Colorado for failing to state a single subject, and did not make it onto the ballot as a result. No ballot issues to interpret Amendment 41 will be placed before Colorado voters in 2008. The Colorado General Assembly did not propose any referenda to do so, and no citizen initiated ballot issues were proposed and had titles approved in time to be included on the November 2008 ballot.  Complaints and Penalties  The Ethics Commission has handled fewer complaints than opponents of Amendment 41 feared, and even fewer have found any violation or imposed any penalty. In 2009, the Ethics Commission fined a state employee $400 for operating an outside business that conflicted with his state job.Buescher v. Whitfield, In 2011, the Ethics Commission fined the Public Trustees Association of Colorado just under $3000 for gift ban violations.Robert Wechsler, the Conflicts of Colorado's Public Trustees, http://www.cityethics.org/content/conflicts- colorados-public-trustees On June 13, 2013, the Ethics Commission ruled unanimously that Secretary of State Scott Gessler violated the state discretionary fund statute by using public money to attend the Republican National Lawyers Conference in 2012. It also ruled 4-1 that Gessler violated the discretionary fund statute and state Fiscal Rules by requesting and receiving a fiscal-year end sweep of remaining discretionary account funds as personal income. The Commission voted to fine Gessler approximately $1600.Joey Bunch, \\"Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler wrong to use state funds for trip, ethics commission rules - The Denver Post http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_23453397/colorado-secretary-state- scott-gessler-wrong-use-state#ixzz2WJBklUB3 See also * List of Colorado ballot measures  References  External links * Legislative Council ballot analysis * Ballot question language * Constitutional Amendment language * Suthers: Amendment 41 prohibits Nobel Prize money * No On 41 committee opposing the initiative * Coloradans for Clean Government political action committee supporting the initiative * Bell Policy Center 2006 Voter's Guide analysis * [Colorado Independent Ethics Commission website] * [Eye on the IEC website maintained by private watchdog group Colorado Ethics Watch] Category:Initiatives in the United States ","title":"Colorado Amendment 41"},{"id":"7181618","text":"The future is the time after the present.

Early life and education Arthur was born in Oxford, England. She describes her childhood as \\"lovely, working class, dead ordinary\\". At the age of nine, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, and gave a concert at the Wigmore Hall in the same year. She was educated at Mary Datchelor Girls School in Camberwell and the Royal Academy of Music. In 1959, Toni Arthur went to University College Hospital to become a nurse, and then went on to start a degree in Psychology at University College London. Career Television Arthur is most remembered as one of the presenters of the children's programmes Play School and Play Away with Brian Cant and Lionel Morton. She also presented Woman's Hour, TV-am's breakfast show and many other programmes. In 2010, Arthur criticised modern children's TV programmes and called for gentler programmes to allow toddlers to build up reassuring relationships with presenters. Music After releasing their first single, the traditional songs \\"The Cuckoo\\" / \\"A Rich and Rambling Boy\\", under the name The Strollers on Fontana Records (TF 598) in July 1965, Toni released several folk music albums in the late 1960s and early 1970s with her husband, Dave Arthur. These included Morning Stands on Tiptoe (1967), The Lark in the Morning (1969) and Hearken to the Witches Rune (1971). With her husband, she recalls travelling the world, singing in folk clubs. \\"Hearken to the Witches Rune\\" was released on the red Trailer label in the UK in 1971. The tracklist is as follows: \\"Alison Gross\\", \\"Tam Lin\\", \\"A Fairy Tale\\", \\"The Fairy Child\\", \\"Broomfield Hill\\", \\"The Standing Stones\\", \\"The Cruel Mother\\", and \\"Alice Brand\\". All are traditional songs. Some copies of this album came with a 'Magic In Ballads' booklet. It was while Arthur was performing in a folk club, she has said, that a BBC producer approached her about auditioning for a children's BBC programme called Play School. She gained the job, even though, she says she was wearing \\"an incredibly short skirt.\\" Arthur also appeared on a BBC album that was a spin off from the BBC children's programme Play Away in 1977. Ready Steady Go - Play Away was full of songs in the Music Hall style. She appeared as a solo artist on tracks such as \\"Doctor Foster Tours The World\\", \\"Running, Stretching, Racing\\", \\"Why Does The Winkle Always Turn To The Right?\\" and \\"Night Express North Bound\\". She also performed many ensemble songs with Brian Cant, while Jonathan Cohen, Spike Heatley and Alan Rushton (who had all played at Ronnie Scott's) formed a tight band. Brian and Toni weave a \\"night on the town\\" narrative in and out of the songs about Music Hall, coffee bars and gambling. The back cover of the album sleeve also featured a board game. Books Arthur has written several plays and books, including All The Year Round - A Compendium of Games, Customs and Stories, which was a children's book of crafts for celebrating the seasons. This was published by Puffin Books on 27 August 1981, . Theatre In 2003, Arthur directed A Very Naughty Boy by Adrian Poynton, based on the life of Graham Chapman. It won a first prize at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Personal life Arthur married the singer and storyteller Dave Arthur in 1963, and they had two children Jonathan and Tim. They separated in 1977. She married the former Time Out Magazine comedy editor Malcolm Hay in 1996. Her younger son Tim was formerly editor-in-chief and CEO of Time Out, and is currently a radio presenter on BBC Radio London. In 2000, Toni Arthur appeared on a programme called Mystic Challenge, and spoke about her relationship with Buddhism. \\"I started reading about Buddhism, and found that that philosophy of knowing yourself before you know others, suited me, and I have been a Buddhist ever since.\\" References External links Toni Arthur biography *Toni Arthur at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe *Life after Big Ted * Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:BBC television presenters Category:BBC Radio 4 presenters Category:Children's television presenters Category:English female singers Category:English folk singers Category:English television presenters Category:English theatre directors Category:People educated at Mary Datchelor School Category:People from Oxford Category:Transatlantic Records artists Category:Women television presenters ","title":"Toni Arthur"},{"id":"7181696","text":"Ozerov () or Ozerova (; feminine} is a Russian surname that derives from the word ozero (), meaning lake.

Herschel Lynn Greer (1906‚ÄìMarch 19, 1976) was a prominent businessman and the first president of Vols, Inc., an ownership group organized in 1959 for the purpose of keeping the Nashville Vols Minor League Baseball franchise in Nashville, Tennessee. Greer worked in the financial sector, co-organizing Guaranty Mortgage Company in 1940. He served as its President and Chairman of the Board until 1969. In January 1959, Greer and thirteen other Nashville businessmen, including country music star Eddy Arnold, formed Vols, Inc. The company sold 4,876 shares of stock at $5 each. Vols, Inc. was successful in keeping the Nashville Vols in the city from 1959 to 1961. The Southern Association, of which the Vols were members, collapsed after the 1961 season. The team did not play in 1962. In 1963, the Vols played one final season in the South Atlantic League. The team had a debt of $22,000 that could not be paid, forcing the ownership group to surrender their franchise to the league. This was the last year that professional baseball was played at Sulphur Dell ballpark, the home of the Vols, before it was demolished in 1969. Greer died in 1976. Two years later, in 1978, Larry Schmittou brought the Nashville Sounds, an expansion team of the Double-A Southern League, to Nashville. The Greer family donated $25,000 for construction of the team's new stadium. The ballpark was named Herschel Greer Stadium in his honor. It served as the home of the Sounds from 1978 through 2014, after which they left the stadium for a new stadium, First Tennessee Park, built on the site of Sulphur Dell. Greer Stadium was demolished in 2019.

Cacace Sr., also known as Joe Waverly (born April 9, 1941) is a New York City mobster and former consigliere of the Colombo crime family. He was convicted of murder and was recently released from a federal prison. Career Cacace is close friends with Colombo capo Luca DeMatteo and former acting boss Victor Orena. Cacace was involved in extortion, illegal gambling, and the hijacking and selling of truckloads of cigarettes. Cacace married Vita Rose Cacace and they had one child, Joel (JoJo) Cacace, Jr. JoJo was reportedly a member of the Colombo family and was allegedly involved in labor racketeering before his death from a heart attack on January 1, 2015. On December 20, 1976, Joel Cacace Sr. was ambushed by three robbers near his florist shop in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. After being shot in the chest, Cacace wrestled a handgun from one of the robbers, and shot and killed an assailant. The remaining robbers fled the scene. The critically wounded Cacace drove to a local police station with the robber's body in the backseat. Aronwald hit In early 1987, imprisoned Colombo boss Carmine Persico ordered Cacace to kill federal prosecutors William Aronwald and Rudy Giuliani. Persico believed that Aronwald, who had helped prosecute Persico, had been disrespectful to the Cosa Nostra. Killing a prosecutor was normally forbidden in Cosa Nostra tradition, but Persico wanted him murdered anyway. Cacace arranged for brothers Vincent and Eddie Carnini to murder Aronwald. Cacace gave the two hit men a piece of paper with the name Aronwald on it. However, Aronwald's father, George Aronwald, was an administrative law judge and shared his son's office; the gunmen thought he was the target. On March 20, 1987, the Carninis shot and killed George Aronwald Senior in a laundromat near his home.\\"Mob Figure Admits Roles In Murders, Including Judge's\\" New York Times August 14, 2004\\"MOB TARGETED RUDY, PERSICO WANTED HIM WHACKED IN '86 TO AVENGE LIFE SENTENCE\\" New York Daily News August 23, 2008\\"Mob Chief is Facing Rap NY Daily News January 23, 2002 Furious at the Aronwald murder, the heads of the other New York \\"Five Families\\" demanded that the Colombos kill the Carnini brothers. An enraged Cacace recruited Lucchese crime family member Carmine Variale and Bonanno crime family associate Frank Santora to eliminate the Carninis. In June 1987, both Carnini brothers were found dead in the back seats of their cars in Brooklyn. Concerned about the loyalty of his assassins, Cacace decided to murder them also. At the Carninis' funeral, Cacace allegedly pointed out Variale and Santora to a second pair of hitmen. In September 1987, Variale and Santora were murdered outside a Brooklyn social club in broad daylight. This extraordinary caution helped to temporarily conceal Cacace's involvement in the Aronwald murder. Also in 1987, Cacace was involved in the unrelated murder of former New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Carlo Antonino. Colombo War Despite the Aronwald fiasco, Cacace's brutal reputation gained him a large following among his men. One family member supposedly commented, > With Joe dealing the cards, you never know where the next card is coming > from - the top or the bottom or the middle of the deck. Following the Carnini murders, Eddie Carnini's widow, Kim T. Kennaugh, moved in with Cacace and later married him. They soon separated and Kim divorced him. In January 1991, during the 1990s Colombo War, Cacace attempted to kill Gregory Scarpa, a hitman aligned with the Persico faction. Cacace was a supporter of temporary acting boss Victor Orena, who was challenging Carmine Persico for control of the family. Cacace drove up next to Scarpa's car in Sheepshead Bay and fired at him several times. Scarpa escaped unharmed. On February 26, 1992, the two mobsters shot at each other again outside a social club in the same neighborhood. Two gunmen in a parked station wagon fired 14 shots at Cacace as he was visiting his dry cleaner. Although wounded in the stomach, Cacace drew a handgun and exchanged shots with the men.\\"Suspected Mob Capo, 51, Shot in Brooklyn\\" New York Times February 27, 1992 Colombo enforcer Greg Scarpa later boasted about participating in the Cacace murder attempt.\\"THE LAWMAN & MAFIOSO FBI BIG AIDED MOB, FED SEZ\\" New York Daily News May 10, 2005 As the Colombo War progressed, Cacace switched sides to the Persico faction, which ultimately won. Prison On January 23, 2003, Cacace was indicted for the murders of Antonino, Aronwald, Variale, and Santora. On August 13, 2004, Cacace pleaded guilty to charges of extortion, illegal gambling and the four murders. On September 8, 2004, Cacace was sentenced to 20 years in prison at the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. Cacace was later transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Beaumont, Texas. On December 18, 2008, Cacace was charged with ordering the 1997 murder of New York Police Department officer Ralph Dols. According to the indictment, Cacace felt humiliated that Dols, a Latino, had recently married Cacace's ex-wife Kim. Cacace allegedly ordered Colombo capo Dino Calabro and soldier Dino Saracino to murder Dols. On August 25, 1997, Calabro and Saracino allegedly ambushed Dols outside his Brooklyn home and killed him.\\"11 Years After Officer‚Äôs Slaying, Reputed Mob Figures Are Indicted\\" New York Times December 19, 2008\\"Former Colombo family boss indicted in 1997 murder of NYPD cop Ralph Dols\\" New York Daily News December 18, 2008 On November 26, 2013, a jury acquitted Cacace on the Dols murder charge.

It is a rigidity conjecture, asserting that a weak, algebraic notion of equivalence (namely, homotopy equivalence) should imply a stronger, topological notion (namely, homeomorphism). There is a different Borel conjecture (named for √âmile Borel) in set theory. It asserts that every strong measure zero set of reals is countable. Work of Nikolai Luzin and Richard Laver shows that this conjecture is independent of the ZFC axioms. This article is about the Borel conjecture in geometric topology. Precise formulation of the conjecture Let M and N be closed and aspherical topological manifolds, and let :f \\\\colon M \\\\to N be a homotopy equivalence. The Borel conjecture states that the map f is homotopic to a homeomorphism. Since aspherical manifolds with isomorphic fundamental groups are homotopy equivalent, the Borel conjecture implies that aspherical closed manifolds are determined, up to homeomorphism, by their fundamental groups. This conjecture is false if topological manifolds and homeomorphisms are replaced by smooth manifolds and diffeomorphisms; counterexamples can be constructed by taking a connected sum with an exotic sphere. The origin of the conjecture In a May 1953 letter to Jean-Pierre Serre, Armand Borel raised the question whether two aspherical manifolds with isomorphic fundamental groups are homeomorphic. A positive answer to the question \\"Is every homotopy equivalence between closed aspherical manifolds homotopic to a homeomorphism?\\" is referred to as the \\"so-called Borel Conjecture\\" in a 1986 paper of Jonathan Rosenberg. Motivation for the conjecture A basic question is the following: if two closed manifolds are homotopy equivalent, are they homeomorphic? This is not true in general: there are homotopy equivalent lens spaces which are not homeomorphic. Nevertheless, there are classes of manifolds for which homotopy equivalences between them can be homotoped to homeomorphisms. For instance, the Mostow rigidity theorem states that a homotopy equivalence between closed hyperbolic manifolds is homotopic to an isometry‚Äîin particular, to a homeomorphism. The Borel conjecture is a topological reformulation of Mostow rigidity, weakening the hypothesis from hyperbolic manifolds to aspherical manifolds, and similarly weakening the conclusion from an isometry to a homeomorphism. Relationship to other conjectures * The Borel conjecture implies the Novikov conjecture for the special case in which the reference map f \\\\colon M \\\\to BG is a homotopy equivalence. * The Poincar√© conjecture asserts that a closed manifold homotopy equivalent to S^3, the 3-sphere, is homeomorphic to S^3. This is not a special case of the Borel conjecture, because S^3 is not aspherical. Nevertheless, the Borel conjecture for the 3-torus T^3 = S^1 \\\\times S^1 \\\\times S^1 implies the Poincar√© conjecture for S^3. References * F. Thomas Farrell, The Borel conjecture.

Personal information Bass was born in Chicago, Illinois, but the family later moved to Beaumont, Texas. He was raised a Presbyterian. He attended Averill Elementary School and Beaumont High School, graduating on June 2, 1932. He served on the Student Council, Faculty Advisory Council, high school paper, and yearbook. He first attended South Park College, now Lamar University, for one year and then the West Point-Annapolis Coaching School, in Columbia, Missouri for the 1933-1934 school year. He then entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 11, 1934, having secured an appointment through his guardian uncle's Arkansas representative since the Texas appointments were taken. Earning several awards while there, he graduated on June 2, 1938 and was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy. He never married. Bass became an Eagle Scout on August 14, 1930 in Beaumont's Troop 6 under Scoutmaster Harry P. Jirou. He attended the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in Birkenhead, England as the youngest of the 13 Scouts making the trip from Beaumont. He also visited Paris and New York City during this trip. Bass received some notoriety for remarks he made that appeared in the Saturday Evening Post about the Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, wearing a \\"sloppy\\" Scout uniform. The Clifton Steamboat Museum in Beaumont, Texas has a large gallery celebrating his life and accomplishments. Military service Following graduation from the Naval Academy and commissioning as an Ensign, Bass was first assigned to the cruiser USS New Orleans (CA-32) from 1938-1939. He then served on the destroyer USS Farragut (DD-348) from 1939-1940. He was then assigned to flight training and designated a naval aviator on February 18, 1941 and assigned to bombing squadron VB-2 on board the USS Lexington, flying an SBD Dauntless. He was soon fighting in World War II in the Pacific. His first air-to-air combat action occurred on February 20, 1942 when the Lexington was engaged by two groups of Japanese planes. One of the battles he took part in was the Battle of the Coral Sea. He was awarded both of his Navy Crosses during his time on board the Lexington -- one for sinking an enemy ship and one for helping sink a carrier. Bass survived the later sinking of the Lexington. In July 1942 Bass was reassigned as a fighter pilot and was assigned to VF-29, of which he eventually became commander, on board USS Santee. The Santee was in the Atlantic Ocean when Bass arrived, but eventually was sent to the Pacific theater of operations. He transferred from the Santee and VF-29 in April 1944. Bass was awarded his Silver Star and Air Medal during his time on board the USS Santee. He then transferred to USS Kasaan Bay as commander of VF-74. During this time he participated in the operations in North Africa. Bass died when his F6F Hellcat fighter plane was shot down by German anti-aircraft fire over Southern France on August 20, 1944 near Vanosc, France. Bass was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and Purple Heart posthumously. He was initially buried by French civilians in a church cemetery at St. Bonnet Le Froid, France, but in September 1948 his remains were moved to Roselawn Memorial Park, located in Little Rock, Arkansas. The USS Brinkley Bass (DD-887) was named in his honor. This ship was laid down on December 20, 1944 at Orange, Texas, by the Consolidated Steel Corporation; launched on May 26, 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Verna Maulding Bass (his mother); and commissioned on October 1, 1945, with Cmdr. Philip W. Winston in command. Memorials erected in honor of Bass include those in Les Villettes, France and at the Dishman Scout Service Center in Beaumont, Texas.

Space-filling calotte models are also referred to as CPK models after the chemists Robert Corey, Linus Pauling, and Walter Koltun, who over a span of time developed the modeling concept into a useful form. They are distinguished from other 3D representations, such as the ball-and-stick and skeletal models, by the use of the \\"full size\\" space-filling spheres for the atoms. They are useful for visualizing the effective shape and relative dimensions of the molecule, and the shapes of surface a given static conformer might present. On the other hand, these models mask the chemical bonds between the atoms, and make it difficult to see the structure of the molecule that is obscured by the atoms nearest to the viewer in a particular pose. For this reason, such models are of greater utility if they can be used dynamically, especially when used with complex molecules (e.g., see the greater understanding of the molecules shape given when the THC model is clicked on to rotate). History Space- filling models arise out of a desire to represent molecules in ways that reflect the electronic surfaces that molecules present, that dictate how they interact, one with another (or with surfaces, or macromolecules such as enzymes, etc.). Crystallographic data are the starting point for understanding static molecular structure, and these data contain the information rigorously required to generate space-filling representations (e.g., see these crystallographic models); most often, however, crystallographers present the locations of atoms derived from crystallography via \\"thermal ellipsoids\\" whose cut-off parameters are set for convenience both to show the atom locations (with anisotropies), and to allow representation of the covalent bonds or other interactions between atoms as lines. In short, for reasons of utility, crystallographic data historically have appeared in presentations closer to ball-and-stick models. Hence, while crystallographic data contain the information to create space-filling models, it remained for individuals interested in modeling an effective static shape of a molecule, and the space it occupied, and the ways in which it might present a surface to another molecule, to develop the formalism shown above. In 1952, Robert Corey and Linus Pauling described accurate scale models of molecules which they had built at Caltech. In their models, they envisioned the surface of the molecule as being determined by the van der Waals radius of each atom of the molecule, and crafted atoms as hardwood spheres of diameter proportional to each atom's van der Waals radius, in the scale 1 inch = 1 √Ö. To allow bonds between atoms a portion of each sphere was cut away to create a pair of matching flat faces, with the cuts dimensioned so that the distance between sphere centers was proportional to the lengths of standard types of chemical bonds. A connector was designed‚Äîa metal bushing that threaded into each sphere at the center of each flat face. The two spheres were then firmly held together by a metal rod inserted into the pair of opposing bushing (with fastening by screws). The models also had special features to allow representation of hydrogen bonds.In the same paper Corey and Pauling also briefly describe a much simpler but less accurate type of model, with rubber-like polyvinyl plastic spheres in the scale 1 inch = 2√Ö and connected by snap fasteners. See Corey & Pauling, 1953, op. cit. An example of a 3D, space-filling model of a simple molecule, sulfur dioxide, SO2, showing the electrostatic potential surface, computed for the molecule using the Spartan software suite of computational chemistry tools. It is shaded from blue for electropositive areas to red for electronegative areas. The surface was generated by calculating the energy of interaction of a spherical point positive charge (e.g., a proton, H+,) with the molecule's atoms and bonding electrons, in a series of discrete computational steps. Here, the electrostatic surface emphasizes the electron deficiency of the sulfur atom, suggesting interactions in which it might engage, and chemical reactions it might undergo. An example of a 3D, space-filling model of a very complex macromolecule, a protein, the cell membrane-spanning Œ≤2 adrenoreceptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, in this image, viewed as if looking down onto the extracellular surface. The electrostatic potential surface was applied to a model with atom positions determined by crystallography (PDB code 2RH1); the electrostatic surface was computed using Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) freeware.Baker, N.A., Sept, D., Joseph, S., Holst, M.J. & McCammon, J.A., 2001, \\"Electrostatics of nanosystems: Application to microtubules and the ribosome,\\" Proc.

Somewhat apparent, in stick representation in yellow, red and blue, in a groove at the top of the receptor, is a small molecule ligand bound to it, the agent carazolol, a partial inverse agonist which, through this binding, antagonizes binding of the normal ligand, the neurotransmitter/hormone epinephrine. In response to binding epinephrine, this receptor, in conjunction with an L-type calcium channel, mediates physiologic responses such as smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. All of such binding interactions and the function of the receptor in signal transduction are mediated by electrostatic effects, and in modern structure work they are often studied using similar space filling models. In 1965, Walter L. Koltun designed and patented a simplified system with molded plastic atoms of various colours, which were joined by specially designed snap connectors; this simpler system accomplished essentially the same ends as the Corey-Pauling system,Walter L. Koltun (1965), Space filling atomic units and connectors for molecular models. U. S. Patent 3170246. and allowed for the development of the models as a popular way of working with molecules in training and research environments. Such colour-coded, bond length-defined, van der Waal's-type space-filling models are now commonly known as CPK models, after these three developers of the specific concept. In modern research efforts, attention returned to use of data-rich crystallographic models in combination with traditional and new computational methods to provide space-filling models of molecules, both simple and complex, where added information such as which portions of the surface of the molecule were readily accessible to solvent, or how the electrostatic characteristics of a space-filling representation‚Äîwhich in the CPK case is almost fully left to the imagination‚Äîcould be added to the visual models created. The two closing images give examples of the latter type of calculation and representation, and its utility.

May 19 celebrations. 2013 protests. Atat√ºrk Cultural Center (), also simply called AKM, is a cultural center in Istanbul. As the focal point of Taksim Square, it is not only a multi-purpose cultural center and opera house, but an icon of Istanbul. The AKM is considered an important example of Turkish architecture from the 1960s. History Two Turkish architects, Feridun Kip and R√ºknettin G√ºney, proposed the building of the center on May 29, 1946, and work began on the building's foundation until funding was halted in 1953. In 1956, construction resumed with Hayati Tabanlƒ±oƒülu as the architect. The building, originally called the Istanbul Culture Palace, was finished after 13 years and was dedicated on April 12, 1969, twenty-three years after the 1946 proposal. However, a fire broke out 19 months later on November 27, 1970, during a performance of Arthur Miller's play The Crucible (the Turkish language version being Cadƒ± Kazanƒ±, \\"The Witch's Cauldron\\"). There was no loss of life in the fire but with the building IV. A part of the goods brought from the Topkapƒ± Palace also burned ( a caftan belonging to Murad IV , a valuable Qur'an, a picture showing Murat IV) for the play of Murad . The source of the fire could not be detected. By June 2008, the cultural center was taken out of use for renovations. The center has been closed since then, when a major refurbishment to bring the building up to date before Istanbul took over the title of European Capital of Culture in 2010. The AKM is a model of environmentally friendly preservation. The main visible addition are the louvers onto the aluminum fa√ßade as part of the energy-saving design strategy. The modernization works were designed by renowned Turkish architecture firm Tabanlƒ±oƒülu Mimarlƒ±k.Arkitera website in English The Board for the Protection of Cultural Property decided on 31 December 2009 that the building has to be renovated as it stands. On 9 April 2012, a tender was held for the renovation project. The re-opening of the AKM was planned for 29 October 2013, the Republic Day. The renovation cost budget amounted to 70 million (approx. US$39 million). The project was stopped, however, in May 2013. That year, it was reported that the AKM is to be demolished as part of the proposed redevelopment plans for the Taksim Gezi Park and Taksim Square area and replace it with another opera house and a mosque.Plans for Gezi Park. BBC News. Retrieved 4 June 2013 During the Gezi Park protests, which began on 28 May 2013, a great number of protesters went up in the night to the roof of the AKM with torches. Due to risk of collapse, the roof was evacuated. The police occupied the empty building and set it up as a logistic center. By February 2015, it came out that the 7-year-long empty building was plundered, its technical installations, lighting and audio equipment as well as many other objects were sold at second hand markets or junk shops even though the building was under police protection. Complex The AKM is built on a ground of and has a building plan area of with a useful area of . The complex comprises the \\"Grand Stage\\", a hall with a 1,317 total seat capacity hosting theater acts of Turkish State Theatres and performances of the Turkish State Opera and Ballet, and the \\"Concert Hall\\", a second hall with a capacity of 502 seats for concerts, meetings and conferences as well as an exhibition hall of at the entrance. There are also the \\"Chamber Theatre\\" with 296 seats, \\"Aziz Nesin Stage\\" with 190 seats and a cinema hall with 206 seats. Until 2008, the center has been the home to the *Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra and Choir (ƒ∞stanbul Devlet Senfoni Orkestrasƒ± ve Korosu), *Istanbul State Modern Folk Music Ensemble (ƒ∞stanbul Devlet Modern Halk M√ºziƒüi Topluluƒüu) and *Istanbul State Classical Turkish Music Choir (ƒ∞stanbul Devlet Klasik T√ºrk M√ºziƒüi Korosu). During the summer and Information months, AKM has hosted the Istanbul Arts and Culture Festival. New building For the construction of a new building to replace the original AKM, demolition works began on 13 February 2018, after it was abandoned ten years before. The demolition completed after nearly three and half months on 30 May the same year. On 10 February 2019, construction of the new complex began with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. The new cultural complex will comprise five sections having a total area of . It will feature in addition to theatre, cinema and concert halls, an exhibition center, a convention hall, a library, a museum, an art gallery, caf√©s and restaurants. The architect of the new building is Murat Tabanlƒ±oƒülu, the son of Hayati Tabanlƒ±oƒülu, who designed the AKM built in 1969. The construction is planned to last 20 months.

He was viceroy of New Granada from 1772 to 1776 and of Peru from July 17, 1776 to July 21, 1780. Guirior was born into a noble family of Navarre. He entered the navy in 1733 as a lieutenant. He fought in the Seven Years' War against the English, and also against the Berbers in the Mediterranean. He was a knight of the Order of St. John. As viceroy of New Granada In 1772 he was named viceroy of New Granada. As viceroy, he tried to reform the religious communities, revitalize the missions, and insure more humanitarian treatment of the Indigenous. He worked to improve the economy and stimulate industry. He divided the city of Bogot√° into barrios (boroughs). He also improved the defenses of the colony, especially on the coast. He founded the Real Universidad de Santaf√©, as well as a hospital and a hospice. On July 20, 1773 he founded the first public library in the colony, in Bogot√°. The original collection of the library consisted of books expropriated from the Jesuit community, which had been expelled from all dominions of the Spanish Empire by order of King Charles III of Spain in 1767. The new library opened on January 9, 1777. It is now the Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia (National Library of Colombia). In 1774 Guirior was promoted to lieutenant general. As viceroy of Peru He was named viceroy of Peru in 1775, and in 1776 he arrived in Lima and took up the position. He assisted the scientific expedition of Hip√≥lito Ruiz L√≥pez, Jos√© Antonio Pav√≥n and Joseph Dombey, sent to study the flora of the viceroyalty. Their findings were later published as La flora peruana y chilena (The Flora of Peru and Chile). Again a major concern was stimulating the economy, which he did by adopting liberal measures in agriculture, mining, commerce and industry. He gained a reputation as a man of intelligence and compassion, and a tireless worker. He created two new chairs at the university, improved the medical care at ten hospitals in Lima and established a foundling home. In June 1777 Jos√© Antonio de Areche arrived in Lima as visitador (inspector) from the Crown. He increased the sales tax from 4% to 6%, and Viceroy Guirior imposed a 12¬Ω% tax on liquor. Disagreements with Visitador Areche led to Guirior's removal from office in July 1780. He was subjected to a juicio de residencia (trial of grievances) and his pension was halved. However, he was acquitted posthumously. (He died on November 25, 1788.) He was replaced as viceroy by the governor of Chile, Agust√≠n de J√°uregui. At the time of Guirior's removal from office, the Indigenous of Peru were on the verge of revolt. The revolt, led by T√∫pac Amaru II, broke out on November 4, 1780.

He is particularly noted for poems that, while being rooted in the personal, also show a strong social concern. Ray is the author of twenty-two volumes of poetry, including \\"Hemingway: A Desperate Life\\" (2011), \\"When\\" (2007), \\"Music of Time: Selected and New Poems\\" (2006) and The Death of Sardanapalus and Other Poems of the Iraq Wars (2004). \\"After Tagore: Poems Inspired by Rabindranath Tagore\\" was published in India in 2008. Ray has taught at several colleges in the United States, including Cornell University, Reed College, the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop, and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he is professor emeritus. He has also taught in India, New Zealand, and Australia, and has published books inspired by the cultures of each country. Among other prizes, including an N.E.A. fellowship for fiction and five P.E.N. Newspaper Syndicate Awards for short stories, David Ray is a two-time winner of the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America. He and his wife, poet and essayist Judy Ray, live in Tucson, Arizona. Biography Ray was born in Sapulpa, Oklahoma in 1932. Ray comes from a broken home that was thrown into upheaval when his father left the family by hopping on the back of a watermelon truck headed to California. After his mother's next failed marriage ended in the suicide of Ray's stepfather, he and his sister Mary Ellen were placed into foster care--a system that wasn't kind to young children in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Ray's classic \\"Mulberries of Mingo\\" steeps from memories of he and his sister being thrown out of a foster families home at dinner time - to fend for themselves eating the mulberries from a neighbor's tree. The years that followed were dark and tragic as he and his sister were separated to face their separate nightmares of abuse. He is a distinguished award winner, and has lectured and read at over 100 Universities in England, Canada and the U.S. Graduating from the University of Chicago, BA, MA; he became a co-founder of the American Writers Against the Vietnam War, and has been commonly quoted in recent anti-war actions. Ray's poetry varies from short, three to four lines pieces, to longer 30 lines poems. His work is also often autobiographical, providing unique context and insight to scenes of childhood, love, fear, sex, and travel. \\"Communication is important to him, and he has the courage, working with a genre in which simplicity is suspect, to say plainly what he means.\\" 1 Some of his awards include the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation Poetry Prize (2001), the Allen Ginsberg Poetry Award (1997), the Maurice English Poetry Award (1988) for Sams Book, and he has been a two-time winner of the William Carlos Williams prize from the Poetry Society of America (1979, 1994) for \\"The Tramp's Cup\\" and Wool Highways. Ray's poetry is individual yet strongly social, allowing him freedom to relate to a wide demographic. With Robert Bly, David co-founded American Writers Against the Vietnam War in 1966 and they co-edited A POETRY READING AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR, a collection of relevant readings from the classics as well as contemporary sources. 5 He is the founding editor of New Letters Magazine and New Letters on the Air. His work has appeared in Harper's, The Paris Review, The New Yorker, The Iowa Review, and many others. He has also held faculty positions at Cornell, University of Missouri-Kansas City, University of Iowa, and Reed, as well as visiting positions at Syracuse, and universities in India, Australia, and New Zealand. 2 The David Ray Poetry Award: Named in his honor, this award was sponsored by the now defunct journal Potpourri; A Magazine of the Literary Arts.

English, University of Wisconsin- Madison), on The Endless Search: A Memoir: \\"How can the quiet ache of poet David Ray's memoir, The Endless Search, compete in a market voracious for what reviewer Chris Leman calls the 'extreme-memoir' genre of current best-selling memoirs in the United States?... Ray's search for reconciliation with a childhood of abuse and neglect assumes a modesty that runs counter to expectations shaped by contemporary memoir bestsellers. From disclosures of sexual abuse to 'peeping tom' voyeurism, Ray recounts shameful episodes from the past no less candidly than other memoirists. Yet the restraint that governs his evaluation of the multitude of parents and their proxies, relatives, guardians, and orphanage officials whose collective actions unambiguously disavow his value as a human being is striking enough to capture readers disenchanted by the prolix confessionals of the last two decades....\\" 3 -F.D. Reeve (Professor of Russian, Wesleyan University), on The Death of Sardanapalus): \\"There is nothing like this book in American poetry today, for it is the skilled work of a craftsman whose fine ear and deft control distinguish every poem, all of which cry out against the barbarism of war and the stupid cruelties of those who make it. From the clever metaphoric transition of \\"The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\\" to the deeply moving elegy to Wilfred Owen, this collection of intense lyrics shines with intelligence and passion.\\" 3 -Anslem Hollo (Professor of writing and poetics, Naropa University), on The Death of Sardanapalus: \\"In a time of imperial wars abroad and religious wars at home, David Ray's eloquent meditations speak to all who hope and work for change.\\" 3 -Philip Schultz (Director of writers studio in NYC), on The Death of Sardanapalus: \\"Zbigniew Herbert uses irony to mask his great vulnerability in the face of oppression. David Ray uses a detached classicism to distance himself (and us) from the present horror. But the outrage is there, and the great sadness. I admire these poems, and his courage in writing them.\\" 3 -Kirkus Review, on The Endless Search: A Memoir: \\"Two-time winner of the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America, Ray (English Emeritus/Univ. of Missouri) is one of only a handful of poets to garner a following among nonacademics. While selections of his poetry, eloquent and intensely personal, are scattered throughout the present volume, the topic at hand concerns a boy ever in search of his missing father, or a surrogate. After growing up in Oklahoma during the Depression, son of a dirt-poor sharecropper and an obsessive mother who hated dirt in all its forms, Ray was shuffled among relatives and foster homes, later spending time on an Arizona ranch. He became self-supporting as a teenager and won a scholarship to the University of Chicago. A stint in that city as a social worker gave him insights into his own childhood and the generations of American men who grew up without a male role model. Ray describes the string of \\"uncles\\" with whom his mother sought security and a proper home life, as well as the wealthy guardian who both tormented and sexually abused him during a childhood comprising parts of Great Expectations and Oliver Twist. The author's frank account, unlike many in the current canon of victimology, is almost lyrical, while remaining unglamorized and unsentimental throughout. Ray's quest is alternately heartbreaking and chilling, yet he never lapses into narcissism or self-pity. He goes astray only when drawing broader conclusions, suggesting, for instance, that it is homophobia that drives the pedophile and the sadist. The personal conclusions Ray draws, however, and the triumph of spirit his life demonstrates are much more important. A riveting and well-written narrative of abuse.\\" 3 See also * List of poetry awards References * Dictionary of Literary Biography, Vol. 5: American Poets Since WWII.

Fire support base (FSB) Mary Ann was located to interdict movement of enemy troops and materiel down the K-7 Corridor and Dak Rose Trail (branches of the Ho Chi Minh trail running from Laos to the coast of South Vietnam). Originally intended to be a temporary base, it evolved into a more permanent location garrisoned by at least one U.S. Army company. The base was manned by 231 American soldiers at the time of the attack. The firebase was scheduled to be handed over to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) when the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment (1/46th Infantry) moved to the north. Twenty-one ARVN soldiers from Battery B, 22nd Field Artillery, along with two 105mm howitzers, were on Mary Ann to support ARVN operations to the south. For months leading up to the attack the level of enemy activity in the area had been low and contacts were infrequent. The lack of significant recent engagements, along with preparations to turn the FSB over to ARVN units, had given the U.S. soldiers in the area a false sense of security. The sapper attack was sharp and very successful, with repercussions up the 23rd Infantry Division's chain of command, as the battle was described as a \\"rampage of VC who threw satchels at the command bunker, knifed Americans in their sleep and destroyed all communications equipment\\". Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland was tasked with investigation of the attack, citing clear dereliction of duty, lax behavior and failure of officer leadership as the reasons. Charges were brought against six officers, including the 23rd Division Commander and Assistant Commander. Background and base construction FSB Mary Ann was initially established on 19 February 1970 by elements of the 1/46th Infantry (part of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade (196th LIB). At the time it was not intended to be a permanent base, and was closed by the same Battalion about two months after it was opened. Operational needs brought the 1/46th Infantry back to Mary Ann on 27 June, and the base was put back into operation. According to one Battalion commander it was a poor location for a firebase from a defensive standpoint. \\"[The FSB was built] in a saddle with hills around it on three sides.\\" It was also at the very edge of helicopter range from Americal headquarters at Chu Lai. Any other location in the region would have put the FSB outside the range of the Division's heavy artillery batteries and prevented artillery at Mary Ann from shelling key locations in the region. From an offensive standpoint the FSB was in a good location since it straddled the Dak Rose Trail network. FSB Mary Ann's construction was no different from many other U.S. firebases in South Vietnam. Running northwest to southeast, the firebase stretched 500 meters along the crest of a ridge connecting two hillsides. Only 75 meters wide at its narrowest point, Mary Ann widened to 125 meters at the northwest and southeast ends. A trench, \\"knee-deep in certain stretches and waist-deep in others\\" defined the base's perimeter and connected the base's twenty-two bunkers. Like any typical late-war FSB, most of Mary Ann's bunkers were made from converted metal shipping containers known as conexes. In addition to the conex bunkers, Mary Ann had over thirty assorted structures (hootches, sandbagged bunkers, and other makeshift structures). The southeast end of FSB Mary Ann housed the Battalion Tactical Operations Center (B-TOC) and Company Command Post (CP), both located next to a small VIP helipad. The base's mess halls, a communication center, the Battalion aid station, ammunition bunkers, storage for general supplies, and two artillery firing positions were also located at this end of the FSB. The northwest end of the base housed a second artillery position with two 155mm howitzers, the fire direction center and the artillery command post. The saddle between the two ends of the FSB served as the resupply helipad. Dirt roads divided both ends of the base, and also ran outside the wire at two points: southwest past a firing range to the spring that served as the base's water point and northwest to the trash dump. Soon after being reopened, FSB Mary Ann was probed many times (four attempts are recorded between July and August 1970) and one author states that the base could have been easily observed from the high ground surrounding its location. The last major contact in the area was a firefight on 13 August, when Company A, 1/46th Infantry hit and overran \\"what was probably the NVA command post for the area.\\" After that firefight, organized resistance seemed to cease. That quiet, combined with the usual cycle of replacements at all levels of American units (from individual riflemen to the Company and Battalion commanders), led to what the outgoing Battalion commander called an \\"awfully complacent\\" mindset. Conditions prior to the attack At the time of the attack, FSB Mary Ann was garrisoned by Charlie Company, 1/46th Infantry (75 men commanded by Capt Richard V. Knight). In addition, 18 men from Echo Company's Reconnaissance Platoon were at the base preparing for an operation the following day. These troops shared space with 34 support personnel (medics, radiomen, etc.) from 1/46th Infantry's Headquarters Company (HHC). The rest of the garrison (less the ARVN artillerymen) came from elements of Alpha, Bravo, and Delta companies, 1/46th Infantry (22 men who were in transit between their units and areas further to the rear), and assorted artillery personnel (including the crew of a quad-.50 caliber machine gun from Battery G, 55th Air Defense Artillery Regiment). According to one source all ground surveillance radars and night vision (starlite) scopes formerly at Mary Ann were \\"sent to the Battalion rear for maintenance.\\" This left the base with a series of ground sensors designed to detect movement located \\"within fifteen hundred to forty-eight hundred meters\\" of the perimeter. These sensors had been picking up movement since shortly after the base was reopened, but no contact had ever resulted from the readings. Charlie Company was the only complete company at Mary Ann due to operations south and east of the FSB near a location called Landing Zone (LZ) Mildred (). Companies A and B, 1/46th Infantry, were on the ground in that area of operations, and some of the artillery previously located at Mary Ann had been moved to LZ Mildred to support operations there (including the 81mm mortars assigned to both companies and the heavy 4.2-inch mortars normally part of Company E). Prior to the attack, the attention of the Battalion commander (LtCol Doyle) was focused more on operations near LZ Mildred. In fact, the Battalion command post was scheduled to move there on 28 March. This impending move led to a freeze on all new construction at Mary Ann, including fencing to block the roads leading out of the FSB. Early accounts of the attack state that the defenders \\"failed to safeguard the perimeter\\" of the FSB. The only single volume study written about the attack by Keith Nolan contests this position, pointing out that \\"historians [including the author of the book, who had discussed Mary Ann in an earlier work] got it wrong.\\" Even with this new perspective, there are indications that alertness at Mary Ann was not as good as it could have been. Many accounts by men stationed at Mary Ann mention that perimeter security was uneven at best. One member of the 1/46th Infantry Headquarters Company stated that \\"I don't think Captain Knight [the commander of Charlie Company, 1/46th Infantry] had a clue as to how lax the security was ... because in that area, and only that area, Knight wasn't diligent. He left it up to his lieutenants and sergeants to check the bunker line.\\" In many cases they failed to do so, and the failure was compounded by Charlie Company being understrength and unable to man all the perimeter bunkers. Manning bunkers was not the only problem. Tripflares located in the Concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or backhauling material as 1/46th Infantry prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company. Although not \\"cringing in their bunkers\\", the defenders of Mary Ann were not prepared for a ground attack. This lack of readiness was not noted by the 196th LIB commander, Colonel William S. Hathaway during a visit to the base on 27 March, the day before the attack. He later stated that what he'd seen at Mary Ann that day \\"was a big improvement over that I had seen before ... the troops were alert.\\" Battle In the predawn hours of 28 March sappers from the VC 409th Sapper Battalion approached the wire of FSB Mary Ann and took up positions to launch an attack. The exact number of sappers involved is uncertain, but most sources agree that there were at least 50. As was common practice for such units, the sappers wore khaki shorts and soot camouflage and were armed with either an AK-47 or RPG-7 and satchel charges and grenades to attack bunkers. Sappers relied on stealth, shock and surprise to give them an advantage, and rarely carried heavy weapons or equipment. The 409th was known to the intelligence section of the 196th LIB, but had previously operated against ARVN targets north of Quang Tin Province. It was assumed by the 196th LIB's intelligence personnel that both the 409th and the 402nd Sapper Battalions were east of FSB Mary Ann, preparing to attack ARVN targets in that region. None of them predicted an attack on the U.S. base. The ground attack targeted the south side of FSB where the ground gently sloped away from the perimeter. The northeast side was marked by a steep slope toward a river, not advantageous terrain for a sapper attack. The sappers moved in small squads of three to six men, cutting four paths through the base's two outer concertina barriers. They took more time moving through the third barrier, which was about 20 meters from the bunker line, and then fanned out along the southwest side of the line. Following standard sapper doctrine, any attack would begin as soon as the mortar barrage commenced. The first 82mm mortar shells hit FSB Mary Ann at 02:30, signaling the start of the ground attack. Once through the wire, the sappers scattered toward key targets: the FSB's artillery, the bunker serving as Battalion Tactical Operations Center (B-TOC), the company command post, and many of the perimeter bunkers. Their attack was aided by tear gas, delivered either by sappers (using grenades) or mixed in with regular high-explosive mortar rounds as part of the bombardment. Nolan also documents the VC use of CS gas in his narrative of the attack. The attack against the B-TOC was made easier by Lt. Col. Doyle's failure to post armed guards at the bunker's entrances (which was a violation of brigade policy), preventing any early warning. The sappers used a combination of CS gas and satchel charges in their attack on the bunker (coming at about 02:44 - the time is known because a radio operator in the bunker reported it to the FDC as direct mortar hits and the time was logged), effectively disrupting the command structure on the firebase. At about the same time, the radio operator requested illumination rounds from supporting artillery batteries, but did not indicate that Mary Ann was under ground attack. The south end of the B-TOC was burning by this time, the fire started by a satchel charge igniting a case of white phosphorus grenades located near the south bunker entrance. The sappers moved through the base from south to north, attacking bunkers and firing positions with grenades and satchel charges. The ground attack lasted about half an hour according to one source. Once the ground attack was confirmed at 02:50, Doyle requested artillery fire around the hill, a flareship, and gunships. He also asked for medevacs. Artillery at nearby firebases (Hawk Hill, LZ Mildred and Firebase Pleasantville ()) began firing illumination rounds and counter-mortar patterns quickly, but there was \\"considerable delay\\" in firing the defensive target (DT) patterns around FSB Mary Ann. One battery had failed to plot any DTs near Mary Ann, based on the battalion's planned relocation to LZ Mildred, while the artillery officer at FSB Pleasantville delayed firing because the situation at Mary Ann was still unclear. The sappers, of course, prevented Mary Ann's own guns from firing DTs with the speed and surprise of their attack. Cannon crews were defending their positions instead of manning the guns. Unlike many of the conex bunkers, the B-TOC was of wooden construction and \\"weatherproofed with tar, so it burned rapidly.\\" After calling for fire support, Doyle made the decision around 02:51 to evacuate the burning structure, and ordered the command staff to relocate to the aid station. Prior to shifting the radios, Captain Paul Spilberg called for artillery fire \\"fifty meters out, three-hundred-and-sixty degrees around our position.\\" Once the radios had been established at the aid station, he and Col Doyle discovered that Charlie Company's CP (the designated alternate location for the battalion command post) had been hit and partly destroyed. The Charlie Company CP had been one of the sappers' first targets, and was hit by the first two to three mortar shells of the attack. Constructed mostly of wooden ammunition crates and sandbags, it proved just as vulnerable to fire as the B-TOC. Coming under direct fire from both AK-47s and RPGs, the bunker quickly collapsed. Captain Knight, Charlie Company's commanding officer, was killed in the first few minutes of the attack as were most of his command staff. Along the base perimeter, most of the troops took cover in their conex bunkers when the mortar barrage began. This allowed the sappers to close rapidly without any danger of return fire, and in many cases they were through the lines before the defenders moved from their bunkers to the sandbagged trench line. The first man to report seeing the sappers had been sleeping on top of his bunker, but didn't spot them until they were \\"two-thirds of the way to the trench that connected the bunkers.\\" Many of 1/46th Infantry's casualties occurred during this period and were concentrated among those units along the gently sloping side of the base. Charlie Company's First Platoon, occupying Bunkers 15-19 along the side of the perimeter that had a steep slope, was relatively untouched by the initial assault and manned their positions in the trench line. By contrast, Second Platoon in the southern sector had ten men killed and eleven wounded before Col Doyle and Capt Spilberg moved toward the Charlie Company CP. Charlie Company's Third Platoon, holding the sector of the perimeter marked by Bunkers 9-13, also took heavy losses. The platoon leader, 1LT Barry McGee, was killed fighting hand-to-hand with sappers, and the teams coming through that sector moved on to attack both the 155mm howitzer position on the high ground to the northwest and the supply elements near the main resupply helipad. The sappers destroyed a number of structures near the pad, killing or wounding a number of Headquarters personnel in the process. After the initial shock of the attack, some men began to mount effective resistance to the sappers. Shortly after Col Doyle and Capt Spilberg reached the partly destroyed Charlie Company CP, the base's quad .50 began firing, \\"walking bursts down the hill and into the valley - and straight across into the next hillside\\". The crew continued firing until dawn, when the four barrels on the weapon burned out. Spilberg also began collecting survivors near the CP and aid station, moving casualties and setting up makeshift defenses. Although artillery had been firing in defense of Mary Ann since soon after the first word of the attack reached brigade headquarters, it was 03:25 before the first air assets appeared overhead. A Night Hawk helicopter from D Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (accompanied by a chase ship intended to drop flares and rescue the Night Hawk crew if there were problems) came on station and began engaging targets on the southeast slope of the hill. Forced to break station to refuel, the pilot (Captain Norman Hayes) learned that the additional gunships and medevac helicopters he'd requested when he came on station above Mary Ann had yet to be launched from the airstrip at Chu Lai. Communications failures left both brigade and division headquarters believing that Mary Ann was only being shelled by mortars, making the need for air support appear less critical. While Hayes was refueling, only his chase ship (a UH-1 from Company A, 123rd Aviation Battalion) was airborne over the base. They provided what fire support they could using door guns and grenades, and before breaking station to refuel they landed at the VIP pad and picked up \\"six or seven\\" of the most critical casualties and evacuated them to Chu Lai. The sappers had broken contact by the time the brigade commander, Col Hathaway, had his command helicopter land at Mary Ann. Wounded men were being evacuated steadily by this time, and helicopter gunships were making firing runs on targets outside the base's wire. Hathaway's reaction to what he saw on the ground was later described by Capt Spilberg as if \\"[he] had just walked into Auschwitz.\\" Hathaway was just the first of a number of higher-ranking officers to fly into Mary Ann. The division commander, Maj. Gen. James L. Baldwin, arrived shortly after 07:00 to assess the damage. By 09:00 the battalion executive officer arrived to take over from Lt Col Doyle, and at 11:00 Company D was lifted in to replace Company C as the FSB's garrison element. The North Vietnamese took the base under fire with a 12.7mm machine gun at about 16:00 that afternoon, wounding one American and reminding Mary Ann's garrison that they were still under observation. Controversy and aftermath The battle at FSB Mary Ann inflicted serious losses on the defenders, who suffered 33 killed and 83 wounded. Overall VC casualties remain uncertain, but 15 bodies were located in the aftermath of the attack. Blood trails and drag marks indicated that the VC may have suffered more casualties, but the extent of those losses was never verified. The VC bodies sparked the first of many controversies that came from the battle. Following standard procedure, Col Hathaway gave orders for the 15 VC KIA to be buried \\"before they became a health hazard.\\" Major Donald Potter, 1/46 Infantry's executive officer, issued instructions that the bodies be buried in an eroded section near the resupply LZ. For reasons that never become clear, five of the bodies were transported instead to the base trash dump. By the time this was noticed, it was past 12:00 and the bodies were beginning to bloat in the heat. Rather than move the bodies again, Maj Potter instructed the commander of Company D to \\"go on and burn them down there in the trash dump.\\" Burning the bodies of enemy combatants is considered a war crime, but Potter did not seem to realize this. Nolan also notes that the bodies were repeatedly burned over the next several days. Prior to the attack on FSB Mary Ann, there had been reports of possible VC infiltration within the ranks of the ARVN contingent present on Mary Ann. In one incident, a man wearing the insignia of an ARVN lieutenant inquired about the easiest way to get off the firebase because his men wanted to go fishing. He was told the easiest way in and out of the camp was the south end of the firebase. During the battle, some of the enemy gunfire seemed to come from the ARVN section of the camp. However, one U.S. soldier who was wounded and remained in the ARVN sector for the duration of the fight stated later that he never saw any ARVN firing toward US positions. The ARVN battery was located in the northern sector of the base, which was not attacked by the sappers, and this may in part account for their inaction. The 23rd Infantry Division's Inspector General (IG) team noted that the northeastern side of the base was \\"generally untouched, including the Battalion ammunition storage area. The actions of ARVN soldiers were no different from many U.S. soldiers in taking cover until the attack was over. The ARVN decided not to garrison the firebase after the attack and it was closed on 24 April. Both the attack and events that followed (including the burning of the VC bodies in the FSB's trash dump) led to an investigation by the 23rd Infantry Division's IG and a separate investigation by the IG at MACV level. While the IG report limited its findings to suggestions that \\"[a] Strong command emphasis be placed on upgrading fire base security procedures and improving defensive measures against sapper attacks\\", the MACV IG findings were much more serious, tracing the failures all the way up to Division command level. Events at FSB Mary Ann had repercussions throughout the chain of command of both the 23rd Infantry Division and the 196th LIB. In July 1971, MG Baldwin was replaced as commander of the 23rd Infantry Division, with military sources quoted in news reports suggesting he was relieved because of the attack on FSB Mary Ann. Other sources indicate that Baldwin was technically \\"reassigned\\" and not relieved of command (which is a more serious, official action). In spite of recommendations by the deputy MACV IG that he be reduced in rank and given a letter of reprimand, Baldwin received the milder punishment of a letter of admonishment for events at FSB Mary Ann and retired as a major general in 1972. Colonel William S. Hathaway, commander of the 196th LIB, was removed from the promotion list for Brigadier General, and Lieutenant Colonel William P. Doyle was reprimanded. Doyle remained in service until his retirement but did not receive another promotion. In the end, six officers (including MG Baldwin and the assistant division commander) received some sort of disciplinary action from the Secretary of the Army. FSB Mary Ann and history of the Vietnam War The fight at FSB Mary Ann has been used by historians to illustrate the decline of American military units in Vietnam. Historians taking this position include Shelby Stanton and Lewis Sorley, giving the action high prominence in accounts of the U.S. Army's last years in Vietnam. Sorley's account is particularly harsh, stating that the 1/46th Infantry \\"was riddled by drugs and incompetence\\" and that \\"[t]he disaster was compounded by a cover-up that extended all the way up to the Division commander.\\" Keith Nolan initially had a similar opinion, but later changed his mind after researching the action and writing his definitive account Sappers in the Wire. Sorley's mention of a cover-up is also difficult to reconcile with the investigation mounted by the division's Inspector General dated 12 May, just weeks after the attack. Sorley's account further states that FSB Mary Ann was somehow unique. \\"Had there been other units as careless and undisciplined as the one at Mary Ann, surely the enemy would have discovered and exploited their weaknesses just as ruthlessly. Yet that did not happen.\\" However, there were other serious attacks mounted by VC and PAVN units (sappers and regular units) against fire support bases during the Vietnam War. Less than three years earlier, in August 1968, a Dac Cong sapper unit attacked the MACV-SOG compound outside Da Nang. The compound, home to command and control elements of SOG's Command and Control North (CCN), was considered a high-security facility manned by elite troops, but during the attack \\"a dozen Green Berets were killed, along with an unknown number of their Nung mercenaries.\\" Coincidentally, one of the officers present at FSB Mary Ann had also been at the CCN compound when it was attacked. Sappers also attacked elements of the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) in March 1971 at the old Khe Sanh Combat Base. Opened to support ARVN operations in Laos during Operation Lam Son 719, Khe Sanh contained a number of fuel storage locations and maintenance facilities for helicopters. The sappers took losses, but reached the runway and demolished both ammunition stores and fuel tanks. Similar attacks took place against Firebase Crook in 1969 and Firebase Illingworth in 1970.

Born in Leigh, Lancashire, he played for Liverpool, for whom he made over 100 appearances, and Sheffield United, for whom he played over 200 times. Playing career Liverpool Barton was an amateur at Whitegate Juniors before he was signed by George Patterson for Liverpool in November 1928. He didn't make his debut for the Reds however, until 9 October 1929 in a 1st Division match at Anfield against Blackburn in a 1‚Äì1 draw. He was a forward who struggled at first to gain a regular spot in the side, having had to wait 11 months before being given his debut and only featured in 11 more matches for the remainder of his first season at Anfield. The start of the following campaign was no different either as Barton was overlooked for the opening dozen fixtures of the season. He finally got the nod in November 1930 and made 26 appearances during the run in. It wasn't until 7 February 1931 that he scored his first goal for the club in a home league match against Newcastle. Barton's best season in the red of Liverpool was to be the 1932‚Äì33 season when he made 36 appearances, scoring 13 goals which included a hat-trick in a 7‚Äì4 win over Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield on 11 February 1933. Having lost his place in the side Barton's Liverpool days drew to an end in the June 1934 when he was signed by Sheffield United during the close season. Sheffield United A first team regular during his time at Bramall Lane Barton was equally at home on either wing, although primarily used as an outside-right and was said to have a hard and accurate shot. Despite this he was often criticised for being inconsistent and sulking if he felt the opposition were not playing in the spirit of the game. Barton asked for a transfer in 1935 but remained at the club and played in the 1936 FA Cup Final for the Blades in which they lost 1‚Äì0 to Arsenal. Despite his form United accepted a ¬£2,500 offer from Spurs in May 1936, a move which Barton rejected. He remained at Bramall Lane and was the club again tried to sell him in 1938 for the same price, this time to Bradford City but again Barton refused to leave. In spite of this he once again asked for a transfer in January 1939 after being the target of abuse from the fans but remained with the club as they gained promotion from Division Two. With the outbreak of World War II Barton worked in Sheffield and continued to play for the Blades along with guesting for Bradford, Chesterfield, Lincoln City, Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday. War-time seasons 1943/44/45 were as guest player with Rotherham United in the North Regional League and the War Cup Competition, during which he scored 19 goals. His most memorable game was at Barnsley's Oakwell Ground on 18.11.1944 when he scored three times from the penalty-spot. His dismay can perhaps be imagined when, despite the visitors scoring five goals, the home side won with what was virtually the last kick of the game. Therefore, on the following Saturday in the return match at Millmoor he must have had much satisfaction from converting a penalty for what was the only goal of the game.The Definitive Rotherham United.

It is located in Paris, France, on the site of a former morgue, underground behind Notre Dame on √éle de la Cit√©. It was designed by French modernist architect Georges-Henri Pingusson and was inaugurated by Charles de Gaulle in 1962. Description and history M√©morial des Martyrs de la D√©portation, located in Paris, France, is a memorial to the more than 200,000 people who were deported from Vichy France to the Nazi concentration camps during World War II. Designed by French architect, writer, teacher, and town planner Georges-Henri Pingusson (1894‚Äì1978), the memorial was inaugurated by then-President Charles de Gaulle on April 12, 1962. In the year of its opening, a brochure produced by the French survivors' group \\"Reseau de souvenir\\" described the memorial as a crypt, \\"hollowed out of the sacred isle, the cradle of our nation, which incarnates the soul of France -- a place where its spirit dwells.\\" Entrance to the memorial in 2012 The memorial is shaped like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of claustrophobia. The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown deportee who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, dimly lit chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light shining through, meant to symbolize each of the deportees who died in the concentration camps; See downloadable audio tour and map Historic Paris Walk. at the end of the tunnel is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells. Opposite the entrance is a stark iron gate overlooking the Seine at the tip of the √éle de la Cit√©. The memorial is open daily from 10am to 5pm from October through March, and from 10am to 7pm from April through September. According to Time Out Paris, an annual Day of Remembrance ceremony is hosted at the memorial on the last Sunday of April. Inscriptions The memorial features excerpts of works by Louis Aragon, French poet and French Resistance member Robert Desnos, Paul √âluard, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and Jean-Paul Sartre. Fragments of two poems by Desnos, himself a deportee, are inscribed on the walls. The first consists of the last stanza of a poem written pseudonymously by Desnos and published \\"underground\\" in Paris, on Bastille Day 1942, \\"The Heart that Hated War\\": A circular plaque on the floor of the underground chamber is inscribed: \\"They descended into the mouth of the earth and they did not return.\\" A \\"flame of eternal hope\\" burns and The Tomb of the Unknown Deportee bears the inscription: \\"Dedicated to the living memory of the 200,000 French deportees sleeping in the night and the fog, exterminated in the Nazi concentration camps.\\" At the exit to the chamber is the injunction, engraved, found at all sites memorializing the victims of the Nazis: \\"Forgive but never forget.\\" Reception Architectural Digest included the memorial in its list of the \\"Ten Most Significant Memorial Buildings\\" and said, \\"Rather than rising heroically, the memorial is meant to evoke the unspeakable, anonymous drama of deportation‚Äîits entrance a descending stairway.\\" Fodor's called the memorial \\"stark\\" and \\"evocative\\". The Guardian published a description by one of its readers, who noted the memorial's obscurity and called it \\"small, stark and savagely detailed... which goes unnoticed by the thousands of tourists who take selfies of themselves in front of the adjoining cathedral every day. It is a place for tears and quiet contemplation; a refuge from the crowds and a reminder of one of the darkest episodes in recent history.\\" Criticism According to Peter Carrier, author of Holocaust Monuments and National Memory Cultures in France and Germany Since 1989, the memorial lacks specific references to Jewish victims, and \\"its dedication to 'the two hundred thousands French martyrs who died in the deportation camps'.. identifying victims as French nationalists, distorts the historical record by suggesting that victims died willingly for a national cause rather than as victims of state persecution.\\" He further commented that despite its title, \\"inscriptions on the interior walls of the memorial account not for the conditions of departure but for the destinations of deportees‚Ä¶ [The memorial] therefore symbolically assimilates the specific Jewish memory of the Second World War into national memory.\\" See also * Drancy internment camp * Fondation pour la M√©moire de la D√©portation * List of Holocaust memorials and museums in France * Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)  References  Further reading   External links  * Le M√©morial des martyrs de la d√©portation (1960‚Äì1962), Les dossiers du \\"Groupe de R√©flexion et Production\\" (in French) * Memorial des Martyrs de la Deportation (Paris) by Johan van Parys, EnVisionChurch (2007) * Photos: M√©morial des Martyrs de la D√©portation ‚Äì Paris, \\"A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust\\", Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida (2005) * Resources for Tracing Victims and Survivors of the Holocaust from France by Bernard I.

He resigned to avoid an ongoing vote-of-no-confidence in the Kenyan Parliament. He was accused by the now late Hon. David Mwenje Member of Parliament for Embakasi Constituency of wanting to overthrow President Daniel arap Moi's government by soliciting help from foreign nations. His large network of friends from the west ‚Äì mainly US and Britain ‚Äì where he had been a High Commissioner Ambassador. The speculation was fuelled by his wife being from a foreign country (Uganda). He was accused of displaying the stunning beauty at a time when political wives were never seen nor heard. Few people (mainly powerful) failed to understand his western ideological thinking. He was a member of parliament for Mathare Constituency (today Kasarani Constituency) during his VP years, but later moved to Githunguri Constituency, which he won in 1992 after two previous failed tries against Arthur Magugu. Previously, between 1964 and 1970,Official Record 2nd Session, 7th Parliament; Kenya National Assembly Hansard Vol. 3, No. 5; 12 October 1993. he had been the youngest (at 33) to serve as High Commissioner (Ambassador) to Britain, which was and still is one of the most important economic partners to Kenya; and had, beginning at age 40, served as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nairobi. He is probably more remembered for his tenure there between 1970‚Äì1979, a period referred to as the hey-days of the university whereby black student enrolment increased by large numbers for the first time in the country's history, than for any other aspects of his public service career. His liberal and Western ideology opened the university to many changes, especially the encouragement of women to acquire higher education. He had a reputation as a no-nonsense leader and administrator who would not entertain any margin for error. He managed the university with an iron fist, and was politically very savvy. As a result, he was liked and loathed by many. He was described in some quarters as brilliant, dedicated, but aloof and not in touch in others. Many accused him and former Attorney General Charles Njonjo of being too westernised and out-of-touch with the common African population. This was possibly because most foreign-educated and wealthy people had more interaction with rich, white individuals who were remnants of the colonial era's powerful establishments. But, unlike the former Attorney General Charles Njonjo, Dr. Karanja delegated and empowered those below him to take charge. Karanja fiercely guarded the independence of the University, and had the ability to get things done. In 1993 he was arrested by representatives of the government of President Moi (his former boss), and arraigned in court on charges that he was inciting the public against the government. The charges were bogus since, at the time, he was in frail health and could barely attend parliamentary sessions. The government's heightened paranoia during this time was such that they intimidated those who even thought of challenging the president's government policies. Many opposition politicians were detained without trial, and had their wealth and tax status investigated. Some died in mysterious 'car accidents'. The 1993 arrests of Dr. Karanja and others were condemned by many foreign governments including the US, Britain, Germany and Australia. A few weeks later, charges against the arrestees were all dropped for 'lack of evidence'. Many believe President Moi to have caved in to foreign pressure over the incident. Karanja received a Ph.D. in history from Princeton University in 1962 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"United States attitude and policy toward the international African Association, 1876-1886.\\" Death Karanja died on 28 February 1994, 3 weeks and 2 days after his 63rd birthday.

Curran was an attacking midfielder, who could also play as a winger, he could also play as an out and out striker. During his 13-year career Curran played for many clubs, although he is especially remembered by Sheffield Wednesday supporters for his part in launching the clubs revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Football career Terry Curran was born in Kinsley, near Hemsworth, West Riding of Yorkshire on 20 March 1955, he signed for Fourth Division Doncaster Rovers in July 1973 from non-league football. He made 68 appearances for Rovers scoring 11 goals in two seasons. Brian Clough was wanting to sign him but was put off by the asking price of ¬£140,000 so he controversially told Curran's brother of his interest so Curran would not sign a new contract, thus reducing the transfer fee. He signed for Nottingham Forest in August 1975 with Rovers receiving ¬£50,000 plus keeper Dennis Peacock and winger Ian Miller. In two seasons, he played 48 games scoring 12 goals for Forest, helping them gain promotion to Division One in the 1976‚Äì77 season. Curran lost favour after a disagreement with Forest assistant manager Peter Taylor, and made a written transfer request in August 1977, which was accepted. He was loaned out to Bury during October 1977 and eventually switched to Derby County in a ¬£50,000 move the following month. Curran stayed less than a year at Derby, making 26 appearances in Division One scoring two goals before switching for ¬£60,000 to another First Division club Southampton in the summer of 1978. Once again Curran stayed less than a year at Southampton, making 26 appearances in the 1978‚Äì79 season and playing in the League Cup semi-final victory over Leeds United. It was after that semi-final in January 1979 that Curran was approached by Sheffield Wednesday manager Jack Charlton with the audacious request that Curran should drop down two divisions and sign for Third Division Sheffield Wednesday. Curran agreed to Charlton's approach and signed for Wednesday for ¬£100,000 in March 1979. Curran started the 1979 League Cup Final defeat to his former club Nottingham Forest. Curran's signing proved to an inspired acquisition for Wednesday, he was the final piece of Jack Charlton's side which went on to gain promotion from Division Three in the 1979‚Äì80 season. He was an immensely popular and successful player during his time at Hillsborough, scoring 24 goals in that promotion season. Such was his popularity that he had his own fan club and recorded a song called \\"Singing the Blues\\". Curran was involved in an incident the following season in a match at Oldham on 6 September 1980 when he was sent off after a fracas with Simon Stainrod causing Wednesday fans to riot, which led to the closure of Hillsborough terraces for the next four home games. Curran stayed with Wednesday till the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season, he never repeated the scoring exploits of that first season and the team had a new goal ace in Gary Bannister, this and a deteriorating relationship with Jack Charlton led him to leave and sign for Sheffield United for ¬£100,000. He made 33 appearances for United scoring 3 goals before moving to Everton for three years (having spent on time on loan there the previous season) during which time he made only 24 appearances. He was at the club when they won the First Division in the 1984-85 season, a triumph to which Curran contributed 9 appearances. He then played briefly at Huddersfield Town before going abroad to play for Greek club Panionios NFC. He returned in October 1986 to play short spells for Hull City, Sunderland, Grantham Town, Grimsby Town and Chesterfield before retiring from playing in 1988. Coaching career Since retiring Curran has managed non- league Goole Town and Mossley, he left Mossley in December 1992 and invested in a hotel in West Yorkshire which he managed. In October 2012, his autobiography \\"Regrets of a Football Maverick\\" was published.

Founded in 1818, it was named Centerville because it was the geographical center of the state. Until then, adjacent heavily wooded lands were called Magrilla (origins unknown). In 1814, after the completion of the Bordentown and South Amboy stagecoach turnpike, William McKnight, director of the turnpike company, built a tavern at the intersection of the turnpike and present-day Windsor-Perrineville Road. A major thruway between New York City and Philadelphia, the turnpike was an improved route versus the Old York Road, originally the Tuckaraming Trail, a Native-American path prior to European settlement. In 1816 the local section of the stagecoach turnpike between New York and Philadelphia ran along Main Street. In late 1831, the Camden and Amboy Railroad was constructed through Centerville. The village became a stopover for rail travelers, and a thriving center for the bountiful farms and mills which serviced the growing population. It quickly became the largest village between Yardville (Sand Town) and Hightstown, and was renamed \\"Windsor\\" in 1846 to avoid any confusion with a Centerville post office in Hunterdon County.M is for Mercer, Mercer County Division of Culture and Heritage.

The longtail stingray (Dasyatis longa, often misspelled longus), is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae, found in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Baja California to Colombia. It inhabits sandy habitats down to a depth of . Measuring up to across, this species has a rhomboid pectoral fin disc, a lower (but not upper) fin fold on the tail, and numerous dermal denticles along the back and behind the stinging spine. The longtail stingray feeds mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and crustaceans. It is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to 1-5 young in late summer. At present, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is unable to assess this species beyond Data Deficient. It is caught for food, likely throughout its range, but specific fishery data is lacking. Taxonomy and phylogeny American zoologist Samuel Garman published the original description of the longtail stingray in an 1880 issue of the scientific journal Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. He gave it the name Trygon longa, in reference to the long tail, and designated a specimen from Acapulco, Mexico and another from Panama as the syntypes. Subsequent authors placed this species in the genus Dasyatis.Catalog of Fishes (Online Version) . California Academy of Sciences. Retrieved on December 2, 2009. A 2001 phylogenetic analysis by Lisa Rosenberger, based on morphological characters, found that the southern stingray (D. americana) of the western Atlantic is the sister species of the longtail stingray. These two species may have evolutionarily diverged with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma). Distribution and habitat The longtail stingray is found along the tropical Pacific coast of the Americas, from central Baja California (though it may occur as far north as San Diego, California) to Colombia, including the Revillagigedo and Galapagos Islands. This species inhabits sandy or muddy flats to a depth of , often near rocky or coral reefs, or in estuaries. In the Galapagos, it was reportedly abundant in the shallow lagoons of mangrove swamps at Fernandina Island. Description The longtail stingray reaches a maximum known disc width of , length of , and weight of . It has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc about a sixth wider than long, with the outer corners broadly rounded. The front margins are nearly straight, meeting the tip of the snout at a blunt angle. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth; the two on the sides are smaller than the others. The pelvic fins are rounded. The whip-like tail bears a stinging spine and measures more than twice as long as the disc. Behind the spine, the tail becomes laterally compressed with a low keel above and a short, narrow fin fold below. There is a row of pointed tubercles running along the midline of the back from between the \\"shoulders\\" to the base of the tail. Two much shorter rows of smaller tubercles, slightly converging backward, are found alongside the central row behind the shoulders. Numerous small dermal denticles are also found between the eyes and on the tail behind the spine. The dorsal coloration varies from plain reddish-brown to dark gray, and the underside is light. The extent of denticle coverage and number of oral papillae can vary among individuals. The longtail stingray closely resembles the diamond stingray (D. dipterura), which is found in the same region, but can be distinguished by its lack of an upper tail fold. The length of the tail is not a reliable diagnostic character for this species, as it is frequently damaged. Biology and ecology Apparently solitary in nature, the longtail stingray is a predator of bottom-dwelling bony fishes and invertebrates, in particular stomatopods, decapods, and molluscs. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium cimari, A. cleofanus, A. costarricense, A. puntarenasense, and A. vargasi, Anthocephalum lukei and A. michaeli, Parachristianella dimegacantha, Pseudochristianella elegantissima and P. nudiscula, and Pterobothrioides carvajali, and the monogenean Listrocephalos whittingtoni. Like other stingrays, the longtail stingray is aplacental viviparous with the developing embryos sustained initially by yolk and later by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") produced by the mother. Adult females have a single functional ovary. Near-term females appear to swim into shallow estuaries and tidal creeks to give birth, following a gestation period of 10-11 months, and may mate again immediately after. A litter contains 1-5 young, each measuring about across. Males mature sexually at across, and females at across. Human interactions The tail spine of the longtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. This species is of some commercial importance in Mexico, where it is sold fresh or dried and salted. This species is likely landed by inshore fisheries targeting shark and ray throughout Central America; it is caught by bottom trawls and longlines, and is especially susceptible to gillnets as its tail spine easily becomes entangled in the mesh. The impact of fishing on its population is unknown, as fishery landings in the region are poorly monitored and the longtail stingray is not reported separately from other ray species. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, while noting that its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from over-exploitation.

It stood as the tallest building in Boston from its completion in 1893 until 1915, when the Custom House Tower was built; however, it was not the tallest overall structure in Boston, as the steeple of the 1867 Church of the Covenant was much taller than the Ames Building. Nevertheless, it is considered to be Boston's first skyscraper. In 2007, the building was converted from office space to a luxury hotel. History Entrance of Ames Building c.1894 Located at 1 Court Street and Washington Mall in downtown Boston, the Ames Building was designed by the architectural firm of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge in Richardsonian Romanesque and paid for by Frederick L. Ames. It is the second tallest masonry load bearing-wall structure in the world, exceeded only by the Monadnock Building in Chicago, completed that same year. It is fourteen stories faced in granite and sandstone and includes a four story base with large arches framing the second and third floor windows resting on Romanesque columns. Upper stories feature smaller arches. The sandstone is from the Berea formation in Ohio and was supplied by Cleveland Quarries Company. Construction completed in 1889, but interior work was not completed for occupancy until 1893. It became the corporate headquarters for the Ames families' agricultural tool company. The Ames Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 26, 1974 and later designated as a Boston Landmark by the Boston Landmarks Commission in 1993. Renovations After being unoccupied for eight years, Eamon O‚ÄôMarah, Rich Kilstock and Seth Greenberg (Ames Hotel Partners, LLC) and Normandy Real Estate Partners for $17.7 million purchased the structure in April 2007. Tishman Construction Corporation of New York completed renovations to the building based on a design by Cambridge Seven Associates and with oversight provided by Walsh Co. LLC of Morristown, New Jersey. Hotel Since 2009, the Ames Building was a luxury boutique hotel under the name of The Ames Boston Hotel. In 2019, the hotel closed and nearby Suffolk University purchased it for use as a dormitory opening in the fall of 2020.

Paul Doktor. The son of singer- pianist Georgine and violist Karl Doktor, at the age of five, Paul began violin studies with his father, and received his diploma from the State Academy of Music in 1938. While still in his teens, he toured as a violinist with the Adolf Busch Chamber Orchestra, but the youthful performer's mastery of the viola came to the fore when, at a few days' notice, he was asked to take over from the ailing second violist in a performance of a Mendelssohn Quintet with the Busch Quartet. His achievement was so remarkable that he was invited to join the Quartet in presenting a series of Mozart quintets at London's Wigmore Hall. From then on, Paul Doktor stuck to the instrument fate had chosen for him, and became the first violist ever to have been awarded unanimously the First Prize at the International Music Competition in Geneva. He left Vienna in 1938 and from 1939 to 1947 was solo violist with the Lucerne Symphony Orchestra. He moved to the United States in 1947 and became an American citizen in 1952. His American debut at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. was certainly auspicious: \\"Not for many years has so competent a master of the viola been heard in American concert halls\\", commented the Washington Post. From then on, he appeared widely as recitalist, soloist with orchestras and as a chamber musician. Paul Doktor was equally at home with the baroque, classical and modern repertoires. With Yaltah Menuhin, he introduced to American audiences a concerto by J.C.F. Bach for viola, pianoforte and orchestra, which he had discovered in Paris. He gave the world premiere of Quincy Porter's Concerto for Viola and Orchestra at the Columbia University American Music Festival and recorded Walter Piston's Viola Concerto with the Louisville Orchestra for their First Edition Record series. He also played the BBC premiere of Wilfred Josephs' concertante (\\"Mediatio di Beornmundo\\"), which he repeated for its American premiere in New York. In addition to his solo career, Paul Doktor was a founder-member of the Rococo Ensemble, the New York String Sextet, The New String Trio of New York, with whom he recorded the Max Reger and Frank Martin string trios, and the Duo Doktor-Menuhin. Extensive tours took the Duo all over the United States and Alaska. They also joined forces in making four television films about the viola for the National Educational Network; these comprise rarely performed music by Marais, Telemann, Dittersdorf, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Hummel, Berlioz, Brahms and Flackton. Many of these works were edited by Paul Doktor. Paul was often joined by Yaltah in demonstration lectures and string seminars, which he gave at the Eastman School of Music and the University of Missouri. When not performing, he was a faculty member at the Juilliard School, The Mannes College of Music and New York University. He also taught at the Philadelphia Musical Academy and Farleigh Dickinson University and was a guest professor at the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. In appreciation of his diverse educational activities, he was recipient of the 1977 \\"Artist-Teacher of the Year\\" award, given annually by the American String Teachers Association to one outstanding contributor to string pedagogy in the world. A former student of Doktor, Adam Crane, has begun compiling unpublished edits to Doktor's viola editions, including the Carl Stamitz Concerto in D Major.

Political career Chitunda moved from Angola to Zaire, fearing arrest by the Portuguese colonial authorities. He joined UNITA in 1966 and served as its representative to the U.S. southwest before being promoted to representative to the U.S. in 1976. He became the Vice President of UNITA in August 1986 at the sixth party congress. Assassination In 1992, after decades of war between UNITA and the governing MPLA, the first Presidential elections were scheduled. Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi won 40.6%. Because no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. But he sent Chitunda, then Vice President of UNITA, and Elias Salupeto Pena, a UNITA senior advisor, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round.^ Rothchild, Donald S. Managing Ethnic Conflict in Africa: Pressures and Incentives for Cooperation, 1997. Page 134. The election process broke down on October 31 when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by- house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. On November 2, 1992, assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy, pulling him and another UNITA official from their car and shooting both of them in their faces.

Goodrich, widow of Admiral Goodrich and mother of Lt. Goodrich; and commissioned on 24 April 1945, Commander Dale R. Frakes in command. Service history After shakedown training in the Caribbean, Goodrich transited the Panama Canal on 12 November 1945 to support the occupation of Japan. She patrolled between principal Japanese ports until October 1946; then she based at Tsingtao, China, for patrol along the coast of Korea. The destroyer returned to San Francisco, California, on 21 December 1946 and departed on 7 January 1947 to base at Newport, Rhode Island, as a unit of the United States Atlantic Fleet. Goodrich overhauled in the New York Naval Shipyard, then served in the Mediterranean Sea (2 February - 22 May 1948). This was her first of many annual tours with the \\"steel gray stabilizers\\" of the 6th Fleet, of actively countering the repeated threats of the Soviets to overrun the defenseless nations of the Balkans and the Middle East. Goodrich was reclassified a radar picket destroyer, DDR-831, on 18 March 1949. Goodrich in 1945. Her service included patrol along the Israeli-Egyptian border of the Red Sea in February 1956 to help stem the Mid-East crisis that finally culminated in the nationalization of the Suez Canal. When fighting erupted, she sped back to the Mediterranean in November 1956 to protect Americans in that area and serve notice that the United States was determined to contain and terminate the conflict. The destroyer supported the landing of Marines at Beirut, Lebanon, on 14 July 1958, as the Navy again met and checked a Communist thrust against the Western democracies. Goodrich shifted her home port in June 1959 from Newport to Mayport, Florida. Thereafter her annual deployments to the Mediterranean included intensive training in all forms of naval welfare with NATO units and a constant readiness with the 6th Fleet to meet any threat to peace in the Mediterranean region. She interrupted her schedule in January 1960, entering the Norfolk Navy Yard for an eight-month modernization overhaul (FRAM II) which included complete renovation and latest weapons and shipboard equipment. She was on Project Mercury recovery station on 12 February 1962 as Lieutenant Colonel John H. Glenn, USMC, made his successful orbital space flight. Goodrich went on alert again with the 6th Fleet during 24 October to 20 November 1962 when the Navy responded to President John F. Kennedy's call for a quarantine of Cuba that choked off the flow of military supplies and enforced the American demands for the withdrawal of the Soviet missile experts and equipment. On 22 July 1966 the destroyer got underway from Mayport on her 13th 6th Fleet deployment. She cruised throughout the Mediterranean for five months, unobtrusively patrolling with the 6th Fleet and taking part in combined naval warfare exercises with units of the Turkish, Greek, British, and Italian Navies. She returned to Mayport on 20 December 1966 for upkeep and type training. Goodrich was reclassified DD-831 on 1 January 1969, and was decommissioned on 30 November 1969. Berthed at Orange, Texas, Goodrich was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1974. She was sold on 12 September 1977, and broken up for scrap.

Saman√° Bay is a bay in the eastern Dominican Republic. The Yuna River flows into Saman√° Bay, and it is located south of the town of Saman√° and the Saman√° Peninsula.

It is a significant breeding site for the humpback whale in the Caribbean; the breeding season attracts many whale-watchers. Geography Saman√° Bay lies along the boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean plate. Two named fault lines run the length of Saman√° Bay. These fault lines form the western terminal of the nineteen-degree fault, that runs north of Puerto Rico and most of Hispaniola to form the northern boundary of the Caribbean plate.

Wesleyan) Saman√° (old spelling: Xaman√°), in full Santa B√°rbara de Saman√°, is a town and municipality in northeastern Dominican Republic and is the capital of Saman√° Province. It is located on the northern coast of Saman√° Bay. The town is an important tourism destination and is the main center for whale-watching tours in the Caribbean region.http://www.footprinttravelguides.com/latin-america/caribbean- islands/essentials/sport-and-activities/whale-and-dolphin-watching/ Geography Saman√° is located in a small plain close to the coast but, now, most of the town is in the hills that enclose the plain. It is the largest municipality of the province. It has a total area of 412.11 km¬≤ (almost 49% of the total area of the province), including the three municipal districts that are part of the municipality. Most of the territory is occupied by the Sierra de Saman√°, a short mountain range with steep slopes but no high mountains. The highest mountain is Monte Mesa (605 m). Population The demonym for the inhabitants of Saman√°, both the city and the province, is Saman√©s (men and women). It is also possible to use Samanense. History The town of Santa Barbara of Saman√° sits on the Saman√° Peninsula which came first into written history on 13 January 1493, when Christopher Columbus made here the last stop of his first voyage to the New World. He landed on what today is known as the Rinc√≥n Beach, where he met the Ciguayos who presented him with the only violent resistance he faced during this visit to the Americas. The Cig√ºayos had refused to trade their bows and arrows that Columbus's pathfinders wanted. In the ensuing clash, two Amerindians were wounded. Because of the Ciguayos' use of arrows, the Admiral called the inlet the Bay of Arrows (or Gulf of Arrows). Columbus took on board four natives to show in Spain, but only one survived. For most of the colonial period, the Spanish did not settle here, opening the place for runaways and privateers. In 1756, under the direction of Spanish governor Francisco Rubio y Pe√±aranda, families from the Canary Islands founded the village and named it, Santa B√°rbara de Saman√°. It was named Santa B√°rbara after the Queen B√°rbara de Braganza, wife of King Ferdinand VI of Spain. They also settled on the other side of the bay, in Sabana de la Mar. As part of the Peace of Basel's accords, the entire Santo Domingo colony passed over to the French in 1796. But in 1807, a small force from the British Royal Navy raided Saman√° and turned it back to the Spanish creoles who were fighting against the last French bastion on the island. In 1822, after the Haitians had occupied the entire island, a French vessel threatened a renewal of the French-Haitian hostilities. After a small encounter, named \\"the Saman√° Affair,\\" the French retired taking with them various families that had resettled here after the Haitian Revolution. In 1824, Haitian President, Jean- Pierre Boyer, invited United States Blacks to migrate to Haiti, which by then ruled over the entire island of Hispaniola. Various U.S. families settled in Saman√° and prospered. Their descendants are known as Saman√° Americans. With the creation of the Saman√° Maritime District (an old division similar to a province) in 1865, the city was elevated to the category of municipality. Economy Santa B√°rbara de Saman√° The main economic activities of the municipality are tourism, agriculture and fishing. The largest boost to local economy takes place in Jan-March with the annual migration of thousands of North Atlantic humpback whales that come to the Saman√° Bay to give birth. Saman√° is the center of the country's tourism during these months. Levantado Key in Saman√° Climate The mean annual rainfall in Saman√° is 2,349.8 mm and the mean annual temperature is 26.5¬∞C.

Patties are found in multiple cuisines throughout the world. The ingredients are compacted and shaped, usually cooked, and served in various ways. Some foods termed \\"patties\\" use ingredients inside a pastry crust that is then baked or fried. Some patties are breaded, then baked or fried.  Etymology  The term originated in the 17th century as an English alteration of the French word p√¢t√©. According to the OED, it is related to the word pasty, which is various ingredients encased in pastry.  Terminology  The term \\"patty\\" is used in many varieties of English, but less frequently in Britain and Ireland than in the United States.Google ngrams comparison of the phrase \\"hamburger patty/ies\\" in US and UK English. Merriam-Webster defines it as \\"a small flat cake of chopped food\\", Cambridge as \\"pieces of food, especially meat, formed into a thin, circular shape and then usually cooked\\". In some countries, patties may be called \\"discs.\\" Similar-shaped cakes not made from ground beef may also be called \\"burgers\\": \\"fish burgers\\" may be made from reshaped mechanically separated meat. Patties made from chicken meat may be called chicken patties. Veggie burger patties are made without meat and instead use legumes, grains, other mixed vegetables, and/or soy products such as tofu or tempeh or seitan, a product made of wheat gluten, often mixed with a binding agent.  Variations and serving styles   Croquettes  Korokke Patties can be breaded and deep-fried, producing croquettes such as crab cakes. In Ireland, traditional chippers often serve batter burgers (a beef-based patty dipped in batter and deep fried). A batter burger served as a sandwich is called a wurly burger, and is believed to have been invented by the Mona Lisa chipper in Crumlin, Dublin. In Japan the Korokke is an example.

Quenelles  Gefilte fish Gefilte fish is often served as a quenelle, a patty shaped into a flattened egg.  Sandwich fillings  Rice burger Patties are often served as sandwiches, typically in buns, making a type of sandwich called a \\"burger\\", or a hamburger if the patty is made from ground beef, or sometimes between slices of bread. An American patty melt is a ground beef patty topped with melted cheese (typically Swiss) served on toasted bread, typically rye. In Ireland, traditional chippers often serve sandwiches called spice burgers. The spice burger is made to a specific recipe developed in the early 1950s by pork butcher Maurice Walsh, and later manufactured and sold by Walsh Family Foods Limited and then Keystone Foods. In Japan and Korea a ground beef patty is sometimes served as a sandwich on a \\"bun\\" made of compressed rice; the sandwich is called a rice burger.  Tartares  Steak tartare Some patties, like steak tartare and Middle Eastern kibbeh nayeh, are served raw.  Turnovers  Patties can be encased in pastry and baked or fried, producing turnovers such as Cornish pasties. A Jamaican patty is cooked, spiced ground beef sealed inside a pastry crust and baked.Michelle Garcia For N.Y. Caribbean Beef Patty Co., Business Is Cooking 14 February 2005; Page A03 Washington Post Commercial production Two pre-formed hamburger patties Commercially-produced patties are machine-formed. With mass- produced patties, it is not uncommon to find them with seemingly abnormal shapes or a bumpy perimeter. These groove-like bumps are caused by the machine that forms the patties. They are used in production to keep the patties in line, so they will not fall off the assembly line, and can be manipulated by the various machines. In other boxed patties, small punctures can be seen in the top and bottom sides of the patty. These punctures are there for similar reasons.

He was said to be the primary messenger between General Sterling Price and Confederate regulars and bushwhackers. As a Confederate agent, Louden was involved in the sabotage and sinking of several Union steamboats near St. Louis, Missouri and, on his deathbed, claimed to have been responsible for the destruction of the steamboat Sultana, which exploded on April 27, 1865 just north of Memphis, Tennessee, killing an estimated 1,300 to 1,900 paroled Union prisoners and civilians returning home after the war, the deadliest maritime disaster in United States history.William A. Tidwell, April '65. Kent, Ohio: The Kent State University Press, 1995, pg. 52.G.E. and Deb Rule, \\"The Sultana: A case for sabotage,\\" in North and South Magazine, Vol. 5, issue 1, December 2001. Louden supposedly confessed to a man named William Streetor to have planted a coal torpedo, an artillery shell disguised to look like an innocuous lump of coal, in a coal pile used to fire the steamboat's boilers. An article published May 7, 1888 in the New York Times refers to Louden's claim about the Sultana sinking: The claim is controversial. Most modern scholars support the official explanation that the disaster was purely accidental, pointing out that the explosion occurred in the top rear of the boilers, relatively far from the fireboxes where a coal torpedo would have exploded, which suggests that Louden's story was fabricated. Louden died of yellow fever in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1867.

The tarred road from 12 km before Shurugwi was constructed by a Chinese company called China-Gansui and is considered one of the best located rural shopping centres in Zimbabwe, therefore it can not be considered a remote area. It is relatively below standards with potholes and experienced sinking in some stages, and was heavily affected by the floods during the summer of 2000. The shopping centre, township as it is known in Zimbabwe, was at one stage bigger than some of the small towns such as Shurugwi and Zvishavane but things started deteriorating due to the economic meltdown as experienced in the country. History Cha Cha Cha was derived from the name of the hotel at the township which is called Happy Cha Cha Cha Hotel which was known for all holding concert of Cha Cha Cha dancers during its early days. Cha Cha Cha was an administration centre for the Boers mainly of them farmers during its early days, but was later turned inti a camp for the soldiers during the days of Ian Smith. The idea was to develop it into one of the biggest towns, if not cities since there was a hospital and an 'airport' nearby. The original name was Donga Township due to the vast number of dongas through erosion. In 1980, it was renamed Herbert Chitepo Business Centre after the late liberation struggle hero but that name failed to be recognised. Main Routes It is at a confluence where major road routes meet. All traffic flows from Shurugwi on one road only to divert into different roads at Cha Cha Cha. The main road continues to Beit Bridge where traffic to Mashava and Masvingo will divert to the east while Zvishavane and Bulawayo will divert west wards after 49 km. The Beit Bridge road will continue straight on. Other Rural Links Roads to Pakame Mission will take the south western direction from Cha Cha Cha while the Tongogara route takes the Eastern direction. Tongogara High School is 17 km to the east while Pakame Mission is 20 km to the South-West. Hanke Mission is 20 km to the North. Vungwi Primary School is 2 km along the Tongogara road. Zvamabande Hospital is 2 km to South -East, 1 km along the main Beit Bridge road and 1 km off the highway to the east. Landing Ground There is a landing ground for small to medium aeroplanes. Mugabe makes use of it when he is visiting the area which happens once in every 25 years, as January 2006 he had only visited the areas twice making him a generally unknown figure among the rural people who vote him into power. Due to the poor state of the dusty/dirty road, motorists have opened up several tracks through the landing area which is an even more clear sign of economic hardship. Main Schools Vungwi Primary School, Wida Primary School, Mhangami Primary School, Mupangai Secondary School, and Rusununguko Secondary School are all within 5 km from Cha Cha Cha Township. Main Shops The major business at Cha Cha Cha is retail. Most of the business men are general dealers, and there are 2 bakers operating at the township and about 4 millers. Ganyani was traditionally the biggest shop due to their business diversity. There are also a number of bottle stores and 2 beer halls making it the 'only' best place to relax. Growth Point Statures After the demise of Tongogara Township to be the growth point in Shurugwi mainly due to its location, the status was moved to Cha Cha Cha. This has seen a Post Office being opened at the centre and a number of super market chains has since tried their luck there. During the early years of the two townships, there have been competition to grow but Cha Cha Cha easily won it because of its location. There is only one bus route passing through Tongogara. Residential Areas After 1990 residential stands were allocated in order to develop a residential suburb-like area which was to kick start the development Cha Cha Cha Township towards a town status but the economic conditions has hampered such aspirations. Modern houses are being constructed however and most companies have their regional headquarters at Cha Cha Cha due to roughly available facilities and ease of access. Surrounding Villages Marira, Mbengo, Ndanga, Ndawana, Mhangami;,kuziyamisa and others all are the sphere of influence of Cha Cha Cha Township.

The club was established 2 December 1899 as Chemnitzer Sportclub Britannia and was a founding member of the German Football Association (Deutscher Fu√üball Bund) at Leipzig in 1900. __TOC__ History The team was renamed SC Britannia Chemnitz in April 1900 and through the first two decades of the century made regular appearances in the playoff rounds of the Verband Mitteldeutscher Ballspiel-Vereine (Middle German Football League), but was generally unable to advance past the semi-finals. The club's best results came in the late 20s. In 1927, they finished as vice-champions to VfB Leipzig and then advanced to the opening round of the national playoffs as regional cup winners, where they were put out by 1. FC N√ºrnberg (1‚Äì5). They made a second regional final appearance in 1929, but lost again, this time to Dresdner SC (2‚Äì3). In November 1933 the club merged with Sportclub Sachsen 1909 Chemnitz but could not avoid bankruptcy and collapsed. The membership immediately re- established the association as Chemnitzer Ballspiel-Club 1933. That same year German football was re-organized under the Third Reich into sixteen top flight Gauligen. Britannia took up play in the Gauliga Sachsen, but were immediately relegated. The team earned a return to the top flight in 1939 and finished second to Dresdner SC in group 2 of the division. Chemnitz fell to a mid-table side as play in the Gauliga Sachsen came to be almost completely dominated by Dresden to near the end of World War II. As the war overcame that part of the country the Gauliga was broken up into a number of smaller city-based divisions and play in the 1944‚Äì45 season was incomplete. After the war occupying Allied authorities ordered most organizations in Germany disbanded, including sports and football clubs. In late 1945, the formation of new clubs was allowed and the former membership of CBC became part of SG Chemnitz-West. The team then went through a succession of name changes as was common in East German football playing briefly as BSG Nagema Chemnitz (1950‚Äì51) and then BSG Stahlwerk Chemnitz (1951‚Äì52). The city of Chemnitz itself was then renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt in 1953, and the football club followed suit becoming BSG Stahl Karl-Marx-Stadt, later BSG Chemie Karl-Marx-Stadt. In 1956, Chemie was attached into SC Karl-Marx-Stadt and in 1966 it was separated as FC Karl-Marx- Stadt. After German re-unification in 1990 the city's original name was restored and the team played as Chemnitzer FC. Stadium Chemnitz played its home matches at the Garrison-Exerzierplatz until 1917, and at Bernhardstra√üe until 1926. In 1926, they moved to the Kampfbahn an der Reichenhainer Stra√üe which had a capacity of 10,000. The facility underwent several name changes ‚Äì S√ºdkampfbahn (1933‚Äì38), Gro√ükampfbahn (1938‚Äì45), Ernst-Th√§lmann-Stadion (1945‚Äì1992) ‚Äì and is today known as the Sportforum Chemnitz.

Continuous descent approach (CDA) also known as optimized profile descent (OPD), is a method by which aircraft approach airports prior to landing.

Instead of approaching an airport in a stairstep fashion, throttling down and requesting permission to descend to each new (lower) altitude, CDA allows for a smooth, constant-angle descent to landing. A continuous descent approach starts from the top of descent, i.e. at cruise altitude, and allows the aircraft flying its individual optimal vertical profile down to runway threshold.

Intellipedia is an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the United States Intelligence Community (IC).http://www.intelink.gov It was established as a pilot project in late 2005 and formally announced in April 2006.INSA, Analytic Transformation, September 2007, p. 12. Intellipedia consists of three wikis running on the separate JWICS (Intellipedia-TS), SIPRNet (Intellipedia-S), and DNI-U (Intellipedia-U) networks. The levels of classification allowed for information on the three wikis are Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS SCI), Secret (S), and Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU or FOUO) information, respectively. Each of the wikis is used by individuals with appropriate clearances from the 16 agencies of the US intelligence community and other national-security related organizations, including Combatant Commands and other federal departments. The wikis are not open to the public.Vogel, Steve, \\"For Intelligence Officers, A Wiki Way to Connect Dots \\", Washington Post, August 27, 2009, p. 23. Intellipedia is a project of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Intelligence Community Enterprise Services (ICES) office headquartered in Fort Meade, Maryland. It includes information on the regions, people, and issues of interest to the communities using its host networks. Intellipedia uses MediaWiki, the same software used by the Wikipedia free-content encyclopedia project. To the contrary of mainstream Wikipedia, its intelligence analogue encourages editing that incorporates personal points of view regardless of rank as it was decided that, \\"much of the self-corrective knowledge in the Intelligence Community resides in personal points of view,\\" and that, \\"not all good ideas originate at the top.\\" The Secret version connected to SIPRNet predominantly serves Department of Defense and the Department of State personnel, many of whom do not use the Top Secret JWICS network on a day-to-day basis. Users on unclassified networks can access Intellipedia from remote terminals outside their workspaces via a VPN, in addition to their normal workstations. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) users share information on the unclassified Intelink-U wiki. History Intellipedia was created to share information on some of the most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce. It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs.\\"Data from spies now assembled wiki-style\\", Los Angeles Times, November 1, 2006 A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a National Intelligence Estimate on Nigeria.Bruce Finley, \\"Intelligence Fixes Floated at Conference,\\" Denver Post, 08/22/2006 Intellipedia was at least partially inspired by a paper written for the Galileo Award (an essay competition set up by the CIA, later taken over by the DNI), which encouraged any employee at any intelligence agency to submit new ideas to improve information sharing. The first essay selected was by Calvin Andrus, chief technology officer of the Center for Mission Innovation at the CIA, entitled \\"The Wiki and the Blog: Toward a Complex Adaptive Intelligence Community\\". Andrus' essay argued that the real power of the Internet had come from the boom in self-publishing, and noted how the open-door policy of Wikipedia allowed it to cover new subjects quickly.D. Calvin Andrus, Ph.D. Office of Application Services, Central Intelligence Agency. The wiki and the blog: Toward a complex adaptive intelligence community, Studies in Intelligence, Volume 49, Number 3, September 2005. Published on the Web as, The original version was developed in beta form in late 2004 by technologists at the Defense Intelligence Agency, adapting MediaWiki open-source software for deployment on the DIA-managed JWICS SCI network. In 2005 DIA officials arranged to transfer the software and content to community-wide management under ODNI auspices, to increase the system's utility and comprehensiveness.\\"US Government Agency Embraces Web 2.0\\", PCWorld, February 23, 2007 Richard A. Russell, Deputy Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Information Sharing Customer Outreach (ISCO) said it was created so \\"analysts in different agencies that work X or Y can go in and see what other people are doing on subject X or Y and actually add in their two cents worth ... or documents that they have. ... What we're after here is 'decision superiority', not 'information superiority'. ... We have to get inside the decision cycle of the enemy. We have to be able to discover what they're doing and respond to it effectively.\\" In September 2007, sixteen months after being available community-wide, officials noted that the top- secret version of Intellipedia alone (hosted on JWICS) has 29,255 articles, with an average of 114 new articles and more than 6,000 edits to articles added each workday. As of April 2009, the overall Intellipedia project hosted 900,000 pages edited by 100,000 users, with 5,000 page edits per day. As of January 2014, Intellipedia contained around 269,000 articlesKaven Waddel. The Government‚Äôs Secret Wiki for Intelligence: Analysts reportedly tucked classified information about Russian hacking inside Intellipedia for safekeeping, The Atlantic, March 3, 2017. with the Top Secret Intellipedia counting 113,000 content pages with 255,000 users. During the last weeks of the Obama administration, a large amount of information about Russian election interference was dumped on the site. It was hoped that the site would prevent information on the topic to be \\"swept under a rug\\" by the incoming Trump administration and serve as \\"breadcrumbs\\" for congressional investigators. 10 years later A 2017 two-part Wired series on Intellipedia and next steps reported that after 10 years of usage Intellipedia helped the IC get caught up to \\"Web 2.0\\" but never reformed how official reports were created like National Intelligence Estimates. A more official version of Intellipedia called the Living Intelligence System was created after the fact and focused on collaboratively writing official reports. It failed to catch on because each agency has a different process for writing official, classified reports.The Wikipedia for Spies and Where It Goes From Here , Wired, March 2017 Based on the lessons learned from Intellipedia and the Living Intelligence System, a pilot program within the National Geospatial- Intelligence Agency created the Tearline apps focused on writing official collaborative reports in the less bureaucratic space of unclassified content.American Spies Now Have Their Own Smartphone App , Wired, April 2017 Potential problems Some are concerned that individual intelligence agencies will create their own wikis, draining ideas and input from Intellipedia. Sean Dennehy, a CIA official involved in integrating the system into the intelligence fabric, said disseminating material to the widest possible audience of analysts is key to avoiding mistakes. He said analysts from multiple agencies had used the network to post frequent updates on recent events, including the crash of a small plane into a New York City apartment building in October 2006 and North Korea's test of a missile in July 2006. Some view it as risky because it allows more information to be viewed and shared; but according to Michael Wertheimer, McConnell's assistant deputy director for analysis, it is worth the risk. The project was greeted initially with \\"a lot of resistance,\\" said Wertheimer, because it runs counter to past practice which sought to limit the pooling of information. He said there are risks in everything everyone does: \\"the key is risk management, not risk avoidance.\\" Some encouragement has been necessary to spur contributions from the traditional intelligence community. However, he said the system appeals to the new generation of intelligence analysts because \\"this is how they like to work\\" and \\"it's a new way of thinking.\\" Successes 2008 Mumbai attacks page on Intellipedia Thomas Fingar, Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis (DDNI/A), cited the successful use of Intellipedia to develop an article on how Iraqi insurgents were using chlorine in improvised explosive devices saying, \\"They developed it in a couple of days interacting in Intellipedia,\\"...\\"No bureaucracy, no mother-may-I, no convening meetings. They did it and it came out pretty good. That's going to continue to grow.\\"\\"U.S. Intel Agencies Modernize Info Sharing\\", DefenseNews.com, May 7, 20072007 Analytic Transformation Symposium , 6 September 2007, p. 13 In a September 10, 2007 testimony before the United States Congress, Michael McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, cited the increasing use of Intellipedia among analysts and its ability to help experts pool their knowledge, form virtual teams, and make quick assessments.Michael McConnell. \\"Confronting the Terrorist Threat to the Homeland: Six Years after 9/11 \\", Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, September 10, 2007 Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations, a 2008 book by several experts in the field of intelligence analysis, cited Intellipedia as evidence of the changing nature of analysis.Roger George, James Bruce, et al., Analyzing Intelligence: Origins, Obstacles, and Innovations, Georgtown University Press, April 2008 Eric Haseltine, former ODNI Associate Director for Science and Technology said that \\"It's hard to overstate what [Burke and Dennehy] did . ... They made a major transformation almost overnight with no money after other programs failed to achieve these results with millions of dollars in funding.\\" Haseltine said intelligence analysts had \\"reacted 'more quickly and more intelligently' to potential terrorist threats than they would have without Intellipedia\\". Community practices An Intellipedia shovel, awarded to exemplary wiki contributors. The wiki provides so much flexibility that several offices throughout the community are using it to maintain and transfer knowledge on daily operations and events.Executive Biz, Executive Spotlight with Jesse Wilson, October 11, 2007 Anyone with access to read it has permission to create and edit articles after registering and acquiring an account with Intelink. Since Intellipedia is intended to be a platform for harmonizing the various points of view of the agencies and analysts of the Intelligence Community, Intellipedia does not enforce a neutral point of view policy. Instead, viewpoints are attributed to the agencies, offices, and individuals participating, with the hope that a consensus view will emerge. Intellipedia also contains a great deal of non-encyclopedic content including meeting notes and items of internal, administrative interest. Deputy DNI Thomas Fingar made a comparison to eBay, the auction Web site where the reliability of sellers is rated by buyers. He said: > Intellipedia. It's been written up. It's the Wikipedia on a classified > network, with one very important difference: it's not anonymous. We want > people to establish a reputation. If you're really good, we want people to > know you're good. If you're making contributions, we want that known. If > you're an idiot, we want that known too. During 2006‚Äì2007, Intellipedia editors awarded symbolic shovels to users to distinguish exemplary Wiki gardening and to encourage others in the community to contribute. A template with a picture of the limited-edition shovel (actually a trowel), was created to place on user pages for Intellipedians to show their gardening status. The handle bears the imprint: \\"I dig Intellipedia! It's wiki wiki, Baby.\\" The idea was inspired by the barnstar, which is used on both Wikipedia and MeatballWiki for similar purposes. The shovels have since been replaced with a mug bearing the tag line, \\"Intellipedia: it's what we know\\". Different agencies have experimented with other ways of encouraging participation. For example, at the CIA, managers have held contests for best pages with prizes such as free dinners. Chris Rasmussen, knowledge management officer at the Defense Department's National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), argues that \\"gimmicks\\" like the Intellipedia shovel, posters, and handbills, encourage people to use Web 2.0 tools like Intellipedia and are effective low-tech solutions to promote their use. Also, Rasmussen argues that \\"social software‚Äìbased contributions should be written in an employee's performance plan\\".\\"Government taps the power of us: Officials turn to blogs and wikis to share information and achieve goals \\", Federal Computer Week, May 21, 2007 Training Several agencies in the Intelligence community, most notably the CIA and NGA, have developed training programs to provide time to integrate social software tools into analysts' daily work habits. These classes generally focus on the use of Intellipedia to capture and manage knowledge, but they also incorporate the use of the other social software tools. These include blogs, RSS, and social bookmarking. The courses stress immersion in the tools and instructors encourage participants to work on a specific project in Intellipedia. The courses also expose participants to social media technologies on the Internet.Radio interview that highlights Intelligence Community social software training programs, Federal News Radio, November 5, 2007Executive Spotlight Interview with Sean Dennehy , ExecutiveBiz, December 5, 2007Executive Spotlight Interview with Chris Rasmussen, ExecutiveBiz, October 25, 2007 Awards In 2009, Don Burke and Sean P. Dennehy, two early and avid users of Intellipedia, were awarded with the \\"Homeland Security Service to America Medal\\" by the Partnership for Public Service.

Its largest operations are located in the Norilsk‚ÄìTalnakh area near the Yenisei River, in northern Russia. It also has holdings near the Kola Peninsula at Nikel, Zapolyarny, and Monchegorsk; in western Finland at Harjavalta; and in southern Africa in Botswana and South Africa. Norilsk Nickel is headquartered in Moscow and is the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium. It is ranked among the top ten copper producers. The company is listed on MICEX-RTS. By December 2019, the key shareholders were Vladimir Potanin's Olderfrey Holdings Ltd (34.57%), Oleg Deripaska's Rusal (27.82%) and Roman Abramovich's Crispian Investments Ltd. In December 2010, Norilsk made a share buyback offer for Rusal's 25% share in the company for US$12 billion, but the offer was declined. In March 2019, Abramovich sold a 1.7% stake in the company for US$ 551million predominately to British-based and Russian investors. Potanin and Deripaska's Rusal were blocked from purchasing any shares. History Mining began in the Norilsk area in the 1920s. The Soviet government created the \\"Norilsk Combine\\" in 1935 and passed control to the NKVD. In 1943, Norilsk produced 4,000 tonnes of refined nickel and in 1945 hit the target figure of 10,000 tonnes. Mining and metal production continued first with Gulag forced labour, later with much volunteer labour owing to the comparatively good wages offered. In 1993 after the fall of the Soviet Union a joint-stock company was created, RAO Norilsk Nickel. Two years afterwards control over the deeply indebted company, which was bleeding cash at a rate of about $2,000,000 a day amid falling nickel prices, was given to a private company, Interros. By the time the privatization was completed in 1997, the company became profitable and the workers were paid. Nowadays average pay is over $1,000 per month and workers enjoy two to three months of vacations; nevertheless, working and living conditions in Norilsk remain harsh. In July 2000 at the St. Petersburg Research Institute of the Arctic and Antarctic (), Norilsk Nickel investigated using decommissioned nuclear powered submarines, both from the United States and Russia, to transport materials along the Northern Sea Route () between the Yenesei and elsewhere. With a cost of $72‚Äì80 million per Typhoon submarine overhaul and refit, refitted decommissioned Typhoon submarines, which, after overhaul and refit, would have a modified ice breaking bow capable of breaking ice up to thick in seawater and up to in the freshwater mouth of the Yenisei, were thought to be able to transport up to 12,000 tonnes of supplies and nickel between Dudinka and either Murmansk or Arkhangelsk. The Murmansk Shipping Company (MMP or MSCO) () had been providing icebreakig services at a charge of US$11.35 per tonne of cargo (in 2000). Three submarines, which would be needed for the project to be feasible, would be undergoing refit and overhaul between 2000 and 2003. However, no agreement could be reached over who would perform the refit and overhaul of the submarines, nor who would own and control the submarines (Defense, MMP, or Nornickel), nor who would pay for the cost of the overhaul and refit which Anatoly Gorshkovsky, the head of the Northern Sea Route administration in the Russian Ministry of Transport, suggested to Interfax that the state (either a Russian Federal Ministry or Defense), MMP, and Nornickel should all contribute funds. There is no agreement between the United States and Russia to use United States-built submarines nor to use nuclear-powered submarines for transporting supplies. In 2002, Nornickel was the largest volume of shipping for the Murmansk Shipping Company along the Northern Sea Route. Starting in 2002, MMC Norilsk Nickel began purchasing gold mining assets, which were spun off in 2005 as Polyus Gold. In 2003, the company took control of Stillwater Mining Company, the only US producer of palladium. Stillwater operates a platinum group metals (PGM) facility in Stillwater, Montana in the USA. In November 2010, Norilsk Nickel announced that it was selling Stillwater. During 2007, Norilsk acquired a host of mining and metallurgical assets abroad, transforming itself into a multinational with operations in Australia, Botswana, Finland, Russia, South Africa, and the United States. The key deal was completed on June 28, 2007, when Norilsk Nickel acquired about 90 per cent of Canada's LionOre Mining International Ltd, the world's 10th-largest nickel producer at the time. This takeover, valued at US$ 6.4 billion, is the biggest acquisition abroad by a Russian company, making Norilsk Nickel the world's largest nickel producer. On 27 February 2008, Norilsk Nickel through North Star LLC diversified into the coal mining industry by obtaining mining rights for 33.6 million rubles to the estimated 5.7 billion tonnes at the Syradasai Field near the port of Dixon () in Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District (). In the coal mining industry, it competes with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. North Star LLC (), a firm affiliated with Norilsk Nickel or Nornickel, will develop the field with $1.5 billion in improvements at the Port of Dixon on Cape Chaika () from Nornickel, which owns the port. The only competitor for the rights to the Syradasai Field was from the Golevskaya Mining Company LLC (). The Syradasai Field is 105 to 120 km southeast of Dixon in the Taimyr-Turukhansk support zone (). A 120 km road and railway will be built to connect the deep-sea port on Cape Chaika to the massive coal deposit by 2019. CC VostokUgol () or Vostok Coal will export up to 10 million tonnes of coal annually from the open pit mine to Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions. Nornikel has been ranked as the 17th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights and resource extraction in the Arctic. Operations The Norilsk Nickel plant in Nikel False-color satellite image of Norilsk and the surrounding area The nickel deposits of Norilsk-Talnakh are the largest nickel-copper-palladium deposits in the world. The deposit was formed 250 million years ago during the eruption of the Siberian Traps igneous province (STIP). The STIP erupted over one million cubic kilometres of lava, a large portion of it through a series of flat-lying lava conduits lying below Norilsk and the Talnakh Mountains. The Siberian Traps are considered to be responsible for the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian. The ore was formed when the erupting magma became saturated in sulfur, forming globules of pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and other sulfides. These sulfides were then \\"washed\\" by the continuing torrent of erupting magma, and upgraded their tenor with nickel, copper, platinum, and palladium. The current resource known for these mineralised intrusions exceeds 1.8 billion tonnes. The ore is mined underground via several shafts, and a decline. The ore deposits are currently being extracted at greater than 1,200 m below ground. The ore deposits are drilled from the surface. The deposits are being explored using electromagnetic field geophysics, with detection loops on the Earth's surface with dimensions of over 1,000 m on a side. They are conclusively able to image the conduction nickel ore at depths in excess of 1,800 m. Production divisions The company currently has five main operational divisions: *The Polar Division of MMC Norilsk Nickel and ancillary activities, located in the Taimyr Peninsula *Kola MMC, and ancillary activities, located in the Kola Peninsula (incorporating the Pechenganickel and Severonickel Combines, the former in Nikel City and Zapolyarny, the latter in Monchegorsk) *Norilsk Nickel Harjavalta, Finland's only nickel refining plant, purchased from OM Group in 2007 *Norilsk Nickel Africa, which includes stakes in mines in Botswana (85% of Tati Nickel) and in South Africa (50% of Nkomati), both formerly owned by LionOre Environmental problems Norilsk Nickel is known as one of Russia's most polluting companies, releasing approximately 1.67m tonnes of harmful sulphur dioxide every year into the air, according to 2018 figures. Ore is smelted on site in Norilsk. The smelting is directly responsible for severe pollution, including acid rain and smog. It is estimated that Norilsk facilities emit 1.86 million tonnes of sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere annually, 1.9% percent of global emissions. The pollution originating from the Kola division of the company is also affecting Norway, which has, since 1990, offered financial support to clean up the operation. Due to a number of factors, however, this has not materialized. 2007 - Rosprirodnadzor (Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service of Russia) took water samples in Norilsk as part of the check up. The check up was initiated by the group of the city dwellers who filed the petition claiming deterioration of water quality due to industrial activity of NN branch in this city. Newspaper Kommersant was informed by Oleg Mitvol, the Chairman of Rosprirodnadzor, that results of the water tests were expected to be ready by the end of August. Company official said in their comment that NN spent over 19 bln roubles on environmental activity and 1 billion more will be spent till 2015. When asked by the reporter if Norilsk Nickel can suffer any consequences after the results of the check up, the state official said that he won't make any promises or predictions. –†–£–°–ê–õ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–≤–∞–ª –Ω–µ –∫–æ—Ä–º–∏—Ç—å —Ç—Ä–æ–ª–ª–∏–Ω–≥ –ø–æ –ø–æ–≤–æ–¥—É —Ç–æ–ª–ª–∏–Ω–≥–∞ , Companies' News –≠–∫–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω–∞ –±—ã—Ç—å —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–Ω–æ–π? , Polar pravda, #114, 08/08/2007 –í–µ—á–Ω–æ –¥–∞–ª—ë–∫–∏–µ –≥–æ—Ä–∏–∑–æ–Ω—Ç—ã , Polar pravda, #77, 06/01/2007 The environmental problems at Norilsk stretch back over decades, but in the last 10 years when current NN management came to power it did not get much better. Back in 2004 M. Prokhorov claimed that NN will be able to resolve most of ecological problems in the area within 5‚Äì6 years. By 2008 this timeline moved to 2011 or 2015. However, NN claims to be a socially responsible business and invests in modernization. Norilsk Nickel has worked consistently to reduce emissions of major air pollutants. In 2006, the company reported investment of more than US$5m to maintain and overhaul its dust and gas recovery and removal systems. It asserts a commitment of nearly US$1.4m for its air pollution prevention plan. However, official statistics state that emissions remain extremely high. In 2006, international non-for-profit organization Blacksmith Institute declared Norilsk Nickel one of the top-10 most polluted places in the world. NN wrote a protest letter but state of affairs was left unchanged. Local environmental experts report that although there have been some reductions in pollution levels, levels of SO2, HS, phenol, formaldehyde, but dust had increased; levels of nickel and copper had increased by 50%. Morbidity rates are stable and death rates are decreasing. In September Rosprirodnadzor stated that NN significantly exceeds allowed concentrations of polluters in open water reservoirs (river Shuchya, river Novaya Nalednaya and others) located near industrial enterprises of NN objects. Also the agency stated very serious violations of temporary norms for certain polluting substances.http://control.mnr.gov.ru/part/?act=print&id;=4088&pid;=508 Nevertheless, there were no measures taken against NN. At the end of December the company issued a press release on cooperation with Federal Environmental, Industrial and Nuclear Supervision Service of Russia (Rostekhnadzor) and Norilsk Nickel signed a protocol of cooperation with regard to industrial safety and environment protection in the development of the Company's operations. In 2010, Vladimir Putin visited Norilsk and complained about the pollution, threatening a ‚Äúsignificant increase in environmental fines‚Äù if the company did not modernise its plant. By 2013, owner Vladimir Potanin had begun to invest in environmental measures. In June 2016, Norilsk shut down one of its factories, which was emitting 380,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide every year, 25% of the total of sulfur emissions in the city, in an effort to clean up its environmental record. It also said it would invest ¬£3.5bn to modernise manufacturing by 2020. At the end of 2016, Nornickel signed a major contract worth $1.7 billion with Canadian company SNC-Lavalin, to install sulfur dioxide filtration and storage technologies on its plant in Norilsk, in what is said to be one of the largest environmental projects of its kind. Once complete in 2020, sulfur emissions will be cut by up to 75% as a result of the work done. In April 2018, amid rising pressure from the Russian government and Western investment funds, the company announced it would be investing in a US$1bn processing plant, which would convert sulphur dioxide produced during the metal smelting process into gypsum. The plant will be finished in 2022 in order to meet obligations to reduce its harmful emissions by 75% or risk financial fines 100 times higher than the ones at the time. In 2019, it was reported that the group's total environmental protection expenditure rocketed by 117.9%. The cornerstone of Nornickel's ¬£20 billion environmental programme is the $2.5bn 'Sulphur Project' aimed at recycling toxic SO2 emissions, cutting those emissions by 75% by 2023 in its hometown of Norilsk https://bellona.org/news/industrial-pollution/2017-12-norilsk-nickel-offers-a- sketch-of-how-it-will-reduce-its-sulfur-dioxide-pollution The project will help capture 1.5 to 1.7 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide per year and recycle those emissions into marketable products. In November 2019 Norilsk Nickel announced plans to cut sulphur dioxide emissions in the region by 90% by 2025 from 2015 levels. 2020 fuel spill On 29 May 2020, a fuel storage tank owned by Nornickel subsidiary Norilsk-Taimyr Energy (NTEK) collapsed, flooding the nearby Daldykan River with up to 21,000 cubic metres (17,500 tonnes) of diesel oil. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency. Diesel oil is used as a backup fuel for the NTEK coal-fired combined heat and power plant. The diesel fuel storage tank failed when the permafrost it was built on began to soften. An area of up to 350 square kilometres (135 square miles) was contaminated. Cleanup efforts are anticipated to be difficult as there are no roads and the river is too shallow for boats and barges. Former deputy head of Rosprirodnadzor Oleg Mitvol estimated the clean-up cost would be about 100 billion roubles (US$1.5 billion) and take five to 10 years.  Finland  The Russian-owned Norilsk Nickel refinery in Harjavalta western Finland released 66,000 kg nickel in the local Kokem√§enjoki (Kokem√§ki River) in July 2014. After release the nickel concentrations were 400 times normal levels. This was the largest known nickel release in Finnish history.Environmental authority: Nickel leak threatening southwest river yle 8.7.2014Harjavallan nikkelip√§√§st√∂ Suomen historian suurin yle 8.7.2014 Related organizations Gipronickel Institute, in St Petersburg performs the design and construction of Norilsk's facilities. Gipronickel does research in every field of metallurgy, including extraction, patenting, design and more. Norilsk Nickel uses the Yenisei River port of Dudinka to load its finished product on ships for export. Interros Holding Company, based in Moscow, is the controlling shareholder of Norilsk. In partnership with Argosy Minerals of Australia, Norilsk attempted to operate Nakety/Bogota, a nickel mine on the island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific. Norilsk has withdrawn from this project. Competition Vale Inco, BHP and Anglo Platinum are important competitors to Norilsk in the production of nickel and of palladium. Fleet Company fleet provides sea transportation of cargo and concentrates from Norilsk to ports with rail connections. In 2008 Norilsk Nickel ordered five new ice-breaking cargo freighters.

He came from a family of cartographers including his father Lu√≠s Teixeira, uncle Domingos Teixeira, and his brother Jo√£o Teixeira Albernaz I who he collaborated with. Around 1610, Pedro went to work in Spain. Pedro served as the royal cosmographer to Philip III of Spain (1598 -1621) and Philip IV (1621-1665). In the years 1622 to 1630 he worked on mapping the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula. Pedro changed his works from nautical charts to topographical survey chart throughout this time period. Pedro was appointed with his brother to make a map of Straits of Magellan and St. Vincent. Pedro died in 1662 in Madrid. Contributions His 1634 work La descripci√≥n de Espa√±a y de las costas y puertos de sus reinos (Description of Spain and of the Coasts and Ports of Her Kingdoms) is preserved in Vienna. Teixeira's map is made of twenty individual folios. The plates for the map were engraved by Salomon Savery (1594‚Äì1665) in Amsterdam. They were then printed by Jan and Jacques van Veerle in Antwerp in 1656. This work is six feet high and over nine feet wide and a good representation of a city under Habsburg rule. The map and writing along the border show Spain at the height of its power. The work also is a very accurate layout of the city at the time.

Poetry of the Republic of Turkey covers the \\"Turkish Poetry\\" beginning with 1911 with the national literature movement. In the early years of the Republic of Turkey, there were a number of poetic trends. Authors such as Ahmed H√¢≈üim and Yahy√¢ Kem√¢l Beyatlƒ± (1884‚Äì1958) continued to write important formal verse whose language was, to a great extent, a continuation of the late Ottoman tradition. By far the majority of the poetry of the time, however, was in the tradition of the folk-inspired \\"syllabist\\" movement (Be≈ü Hececiler), which had emerged from the National Literature movement and which tended to express patriotic themes couched in the syllabic meter associated with Turkish folk poetry. The first radical step away from this trend was taken by N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet Ran, who‚Äîduring his time as a student in the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1924‚Äîwas exposed to the modernist poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and others, which inspired him to start writing verse in a less formal style. At this time, he wrote the poem \\"A√ßlarƒ±n G√∂zbebekleri\\" (\\"Pupils of the Hungry\\"), which introduced free verse into the Turkish language for, essentially, the first time.Earlier poets, such as Ahmed H√¢≈üim, had experimented with a style of poetry called serbest m√ºstez√¢d (\\"free m√ºstez√¢d\\"), a type of poetry which alternated long and short lines of verse, but this was not a truly \\"free\\" style of verse insofar as it still largely adhered to prosodic conventions (Fuat 2002). Much of N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet's poetry subsequent to this breakthrough would continue to be written in free verse, though his work exerted little influence for some time due largely to censorship of his work owing to his Communist political stance, which also led to his spending several years in prison. Over time, in such books as Simavne Kadƒ±sƒ± Oƒülu ≈ûeyh Bedreddin Destanƒ± (\\"The Epic of Shaykh Bedreddin, Son of Judge Simavne\\", 1936) and Memleketimden ƒ∞nsan Manzaralarƒ± (\\"Human Landscapes from My Country\\", 1939), he developed a voice simultaneously proclamatory and subtle. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the publication of a small volume of verse preceded by an essay and entitled Garip (\\"Strange\\"). The authors were Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k (1914‚Äì1950), Melih Cevdet Anday (1915‚Äì2002), and Oktay Rifat (1914‚Äì1988). Explicitly opposing themselves to everything that had gone in poetry before, they sought instead to create a popular art, \\"to explore the people's tastes, to determine them, and to make them reign supreme over art\\".Quoted in Halman 1997. To this end, and inspired in part by contemporary French poets like Jacques Pr√©vert, they employed not only a variant of the free verse introduced by N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet, but also highly colloquial language, and wrote primarily about mundane daily subjects and the ordinary man on the street. The reaction was immediate and polarized: most of the academic establishment and older poets vilified them, while much of the Turkish population embraced them wholeheartedly. Though the movement itself lasted only ten years‚Äîuntil Orhan Veli's death in 1950, after which Melih Cevdet Anday and Oktay Rifat moved on to other styles‚Äîits effect on Turkish poetry continues to be felt today. Just as the Garip movement was a reaction against earlier poetry, so‚Äîin the 1950s and afterwards‚Äîwas there a reaction against the Garip movement. The poets of this movement, soon known as ƒ∞kinci Yeni (\\"Second New\\"The Garip movement was considered to be the \\"First New\\" (Birinci Yeni).), opposed themselves to the social aspects prevalent in the poetry of N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet and the Garip poets, and instead‚Äîpartly inspired by the disruption of language in such Western movements as Dada and Surrealism‚Äîsought to create a more abstract poetry through the use of jarring and unexpected language, complex images, and the association of ideas. To some extent, the movement can be seen as bearing some of the characteristics of postmodern literature. The best-known poets writing in the \\"Second New\\" vein were Turgut Uyar (1927‚Äì1985), Edip Cansever (1928‚Äì1986), Cemal S√ºreya (1931‚Äì1990), Ece Ayhan (1931‚Äì2002), Sezai Karako√ß (1933- ) and ƒ∞lhan Berk (1918‚Äì2008). Outside the Garip and \\"Second New\\" movements also, a number of significant poets have flourished, such as Fazƒ±l H√ºsn√º Daƒülarca (1914‚Äì2008), who wrote poems dealing with fundamental concepts like life, death, God, time, and the cosmos; Beh√ßet Necatigil (1916‚Äì1979), whose somewhat allegorical poems explore the significance of middle-class daily life; Can Y√ºcel (1926‚Äì1999), who‚Äîin addition to his own highly colloquial and varied poetry‚Äîwas also a translator into Turkish of a variety of world literature.

History Jacob Campbell, a stonemason, constructed a store southeast of the intersection of River Road and the highway leading from Old Bridge to South Church, now Henley Avenue, in New Milford, New Jersey, about the time of his marriage to Altche Westervelt in 1774. It stood on land owned by his father, William Campbell, who kept a tavern on the north side of the road. Private Jacob Campbell served with the Bergen Militia during the American Revolution. His property was damaged during the war, but tax records for 1780 list him as a merchant. After his father's death in 1793, Jacob sold to Abraham Brower, whose brother, John, a blacksmith, operated a roadside smithy until his death a year later. Blacksmith John D. Christie purchased the house for ¬£250 in 1795 and operated a tavern. When he died in 1836, he bequeathed his residence to son John J. Christie, a farmer. It next passed to Jacob Brinkerhoff Christie, manager of the Comfort Coal & Lumber Company. J. Walter Christie, born here on May 6, 1865, achieved fame as a mechanical genius and inventor. At 16 years of age, he worked on pioneer submarines and developed turret tracks and gun mounts for battleships. He built and raced cars, holding American and world speed records before being severely injured in a crash in 1907. He later invented automotive front-wheel drive, used in the manufacture of fire trucks. but is best known as the ‚Äúfather of the modern tank.‚Äù He died at Falls Church, Virginia, in 1944. The Brookchester Land Company made extensive alterations to the house in 1908. To save it from demolition, the Bergen County Historical Society, a non-profit volunteer organization, offered the County of Bergen a 50-year ground lease to move the Campbell-Christie House from New Milford onto its lands in River Edge in 1977 on condition that the Historical Society not only have occupancy of the structure in keeping with its mission, but also the exclusive right to determine its use and historic restoration; in exchange, the County of Bergen agreed to pay utilities and to maintain the house and its mechanical systems in sound condition. Bergen County Freeholder D. Bennett Mazur led efforts to save the Campbell-Christie House, after it had been slated for demolition.Lynch, John F. \\"Bergen Residents Save Historic House\\", The New York Times, August 21, 1977. Accessed June 16, 2010. With a $150,000 grant, the 200-year-old home was moved two miles from New Milford to BCHS land in River Edge, the area now known as Historic New Bridge Landing, in September 1977.Hanley, Robert. \\"200-Year-Old House Moved to a New Home in River Edge\\", The New York Times, September 28, 1977. Accessed June 16, 2010. The Bergen County Historical Society furnishes and interprets the Campbell-Christie House as an 18th-century tavern. In 1992, a working replica of a Jersey Dutch Out Kitchen was built behind the house. The Bergen County Historical Society regularly opens all the buildings, including the Campbell-Christie House, at Historic New Bridge Landing for special events in cooperation with the Historic New Bridge Landing Park Commission. The Bergen County Historical Society receives no public operating grants from any public agency (including the County of Bergen or the State of New Jersey), instead relying on membership and donations.

It was founded in 2003 by three libertarian scholars Carlo Lottieri, Alberto Mingardi and Carlo Stagnaro. IBL organizes conferences, publishes books, briefings and academic papers, as well as assisting undergraduate and graduate students with their research work. About IBL was established in 2003 to promote free-market ideas. In particular, as stated on its website, the Institute aims to ‚Äúcontribute to the Italian political discourse, to enable a proper appreciation of the role of liberty and private enterprise as pillars of a more prosperous and open society‚Äù. The Institute is an Italian libertarian public policy research organization, structured on the model of US think-tanks such as the Cato Institute. Through its policy papers, seminars and publishing activities, the Institute aims to offer a fruitful contribution to the Italian and European political debate. In particular, IBL is dedicated to promote the principles of individual freedom, limited government and free markets and its philosophy is based on Bruno Leoni‚Äôs thought and ideas. In its latest 2016 \\"Global Go To Think Tank Index Report\\" the University of Pennsylvania ranked IBL as the 113¬∞ most influential think- tank in the world, out of more than 6,600 institutes. On a European and global level, IBL is part of a broader international network of research centers informed by the same free-market approach: it joins the efforts of the Atlas Network and is a founding member of EPICENTER. Several EPICENTER partners such as the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Lithuanian Free Market Institute are funded by the Tobacco Industry and the IBL is identified as a \\"Partner\\" on the website of the transnational tobacco company British American Tobacco Italy. Annual Index of Liberalizations IBL publishes an annual Index that aims to shed light on the degree of openness of the 28 Member States by examining ten different economic sectors, which include petrol and diesel retail, electricity, natural gas, labour markets, postal services, telecommunications, broadcasting, air transport, rail transport and insurance. Media and academicians cite the annual index as a source of information for policy-making and research. First published in 2007, the IBL Index of Liberalizations has greatly evolved over the years. Between 2007 and 2012, Italy was the only country investigated and analyzed against sectoral benchmarks. In 2013, the index methodology was amplified to the EU15, whilst in 2015 the Index began classifying all of the EU28. Flat-tax project ‚Äì VentiCinque% per tutti (TwentyFive% for all) On 26 June 2017, IBL launched a new policy proposal called ‚ÄúVenticinque% per tutti‚Äù (Twenty-Five% for all). This ambitious proposal focuses on Italy‚Äôs complex tax system. In particular, the Institute suggests a radical fiscal restructuring: a flat, 25% tax rate on the major taxes in Italy‚Äôs system (personal income tax, corporation tax, VAT, tax on financial dividends); the repeal of local and regional taxes; and the replacement of the current patchwork of benefits with a universal cash subsidy ‚Äì a so-called ‚Äúbasic income‚Äù subject to a number of conditions. The proposal has aroused considerable interest and has been widely debated. Several important politicians, such as Italy‚Äôs former Prime Ministers Silvio Berlusconi, Romano Prodi and Lamberto Dini have expressed an interest for IBL‚Äôs flat tax reform. Bruno Leoni and Sergio Ricossa Lectures Between 2008 and 2016, IBL organized a yearly ‚ÄúDiscorso Bruno Leoni‚Äù (Bruno Leoni Lecture). Since 2016, this lecture has become a biennial occurrence as in 2017 the so-called ‚ÄúDiscorso Sergio Ricossa‚Äù replaced it. These two lectures are among the Institute‚Äôs flagship events, as they strive to bring the Italian public up-to-date to the most relevant international debates. The ‚ÄúDiscorsi‚Äù are structured as an in-depth lecture by a distinguished scholar or author, in which a seminal topic is investigated from a free-market, individual liberty perspective. Bruno Leoni Award Since 2008, every year the Institute attributes a \\"Bruno Leoni Award\\" dedicated to the thinker whose teachings the Institute refers to, and awarded to distinguished personalities.

Biography Goodrich was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of William and Sarah A. Bearden Goodrich. He applied from Connecticut and was graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1864, he spent 2 years in Colorado and Frolic; 3 years in Portsmouth and Lancaster; and 3 years at the Naval Academy. Between 1874 and 1881 he had duty on board the USS Tennessee and followed by a tour at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, R.I. After serving as executive officer of Lancaster, flagship for the European Squadron, and Inspector of Ordnance at the Washington Navy Yard, Goodrich became Officer in Charge of the Newport Torpedo Station in 1886. From 1891 until 1896, he commanded successively Jamestown, Constellation, and Concord before he spent a year as President of the Naval War College at Newport. Originating the Coast Signal Service in 1898, he then served as Director. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898, he commanded the USS St. Louis and Newark, and received the surrender of Manzanillo, Cuba, following that city's bombardment on 12 August. In the years following, Goodrich commanded Iowa, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Puritan at sea and served as Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard (1900) and the Portsmouth Navy Yard (1903) on land before his promotion to the rank of Rear Admiral 17 February 1904 and his appointment for 3 years as the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Squadron. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake he went with his fleet to San Francisco to help extinguish the fire, especially by spraying water on the flames from ships anchored in the port. After duty as commandant of the New York Navy Yard 1907 to 1909, he retired 7 January 1909. Goodrich was a member of the Naval Order of the United States and served as Commander of the New York Commandery from 1907 to 1908. In 1914 he was admitted as an honorary member of the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati. Recalled to active duty in World War I, Admiral Goodrich served as officer-in-charge of the Pay Officers' Material School at Princeton until 8 November 1919 when he again stepped down from active duty, ending a 50-year naval career. In 1873 he married Eleanor Milnor. They had a large house in Pomfret, Connecticut called \\"Gladwyn\\". He died in Princeton. In 1945, the destroyer USS Goodrich (DD-831) was named in honor of Goodrich and his son Lieutenant Caspar Goodrich.

The film was screened at the Hamburg Fantasy Filmfest in Germany, the Venice Film Festival in Italy, and the Toronto International Film Festival in Canada. Unlike the typical zombie film, in which the physically deformed undead compulsively feed on or otherwise harm the human population, the physically normal undead in They Came Back seek only to reintegrate themselves into the everyday life of the small French town where they formerly lived, or so it seems. Plot The recently deceased of an anonymous French town suddenly return to life, calmly streaming forth from a cemetery in a silent procession. The town council, led by the mayor (Victor Garrivier), makes plans to house the returned and help reintroduce them to society. The mayor informs the council that the event has lasted for roughly two hours throughout France, returning an estimated 70 million people to life nationwide, with more than 13,000 in their town alone, all of whom had died within the previous 10 years. However, the reintegration poses challenges. The returned suffer from effects similar to those that may be seen after severe concussion, such as disorientation, sleep disturbance, and wandering. Former professionals among the returned are moved to menial jobs when it becomes clear that, although they can perform rote tasks, they can no longer engage in spontaneous problem solving or planning, and that even their apparent consciousness may be an illusion. This behaviour adds to the growing sentiment that the returned are different from their former selves. However, while the returned generally function sluggishly during the day, a doctor named Gardet (Fr√©d√©ric Pierrot) has become suspicious of the returned after observing some of them clandestinely attending animated meetings, conducted in the middle of the night, during which their symptoms seem to disappear. Nonetheless, the returned reunite with their former loved ones: the mayor's wife, Martha (Catherine Samie), with the mayor; a 6-year-old boy, Sylvain (Saady Delas), with his parents, Isham (Djemel Barek) and V√©ronique (Marie Matheron); a young man, Mathieu (Jonathan Zacca√Ø), with his wife, Rachel (G√©raldine Pailhas). Rachel is initially reluctant to see Mathieu, until one day he follows her home, acting as though he never left. Rachel eventually accepts him, and the two make love. In addition to the nocturnal meetings of the returned, Gardet also observes the gradual reunion of Rachel and Mathieu with growing concern, but when he tries to warn her of possible danger, Rachel rebuffs him. One evening a series of explosions tears through the town, apparently detonated by the returned in an act of mass sabotage but without inflicting any casualties. In the chaos, the returned head for a network of tunnels. The mayor attempts to stop his wife from leaving with the rest but begins to feel ill and, after Martha urges him to \\"give in\\", apparently dies, only to appear later in the tunnels among the returned. The military responds by gassing the returned with a chemical that induces a permanent coma. After guiding some of the returned to the tunnels, Mathieu makes his way back to Rachel, and recounts to her the events leading to his fatal car accident. He reveals that he crashed the car while looking for her after the two had fought. Rachel follows him into the tunnels, tearfully kissing him before he disappears into the darkness. She returns to the surface and observes the military carting away the comatose bodies. The bodies are laid atop their graves in the cemetery and slowly vanish.

In 1962 they published Flows in Networks with Princeton University Press. According to the preface, it \\"included topics that were purely mathematically motivated, together with those that are strictly utilitarian in concept.\\" In his review, S.W. Golomb wrote, \\"This book is an attractive, well-written account of a fairly new topic in pure and applied combinatorial analysis.\\"Solomon Golomb As a topic of continued interest, a new edition was published in 2010 with a new forward by Robert G. Bland and James B. Orlin.Ford & Fulkerson (2010) paperback edition of Flows in Networks In 1956, Ford developed the Bellman‚ÄìFord algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs that have negative weights, two years before Richard Bellman also published the algorithm. With Selmer M. Johnson, he developed the Ford‚ÄìJohnson algorithm for sorting, which is of theoretical interest in connection with the problem of doing comparison sort with the least number of comparisons. For 20 years, this algorithm required the minimum number of comparisons. In 1963 along with his father Lester R. Ford, he published an innovative textbook on calculus.Lester Ford Sr. & Jr. (1963) Calculus, McGraw-Hill via HathiTrust. For a given function f and point x, they defined a frame as a rectangle containing (x, f(x)) with sides parallel to the axes of the plane (page 9). Frames are then exploited to define continuous functions (page 10) and to describe integrable functions (page 148).  Personal information  Lester was born in Houston, Texas on September 23, 1927. He learned to play piano and the flute and was frequently heard whistling. For higher education he considered Harvard and Oberlin Conservatory, but chose the University of Chicago which provided him a scholarship. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1949 and a masters in 1950. Ford continued his studies at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he earned a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1953. Ford's employers included the U. S. Army, University of North Carolina and RAND Corporation. The Defense Research Corporation of Goleta, California employed him for forty years as he kept pace with digital revolution. Ford married twice. His first wife, Janet Johnson, gave him nine children.

Until 1972 there were three city municipalities: Chiang Mai, Phra Nakhon (now Bangkok), and Thonburi (now part of Bangkok). In 1994, Nakhon Si Thammarat town municipality became the second city municipality of Thailand, and the third in the south. Town- municipality Thesaban mueang () is usually translated as \\"town municipality\\". For a municipality to qualify as a town, it either needs to be a provincial capital, or have a population of at least 10,000 and sufficient income to cover the tasks of a town. When first organized in 1934, minimum qualification for town status was a population of 3,000 with a density of 1,000 per km¬≤. In 1939 requirements were increased to a population of 5,000 with a density of 2,000 per km¬≤, plus a financial criterion. In 1953, the minimum population requirements was raised to the present value; the population density was also raised, to 3,000 per km¬≤, before being removed entirely in 2000. Subdistrict-municipality Thesaban tambon (), the lowest level municipal unit, is usually translated as \\"sub-district municipality\\". Despite the name, it may not necessarily cover the same area as a sub-district (tambon); i.e., it may not cover a tambon completely, or conversely, it may extend over parts of more than one tambon. For an area to qualify as a thesaban tambon, it must have a gross income of at least 5 million baht and a population of at least 5,000 with a minimum density of 1,500 per km¬≤, plus the approval of the population within that area.Netherlands Geographical Studies 374 (2008): \\"Institutions and regional development in Southeast Asia\\", S. 125 Retrieved on 3 Dec 2008.

He became stable jockey for trainer John C. Oxley in 1970, but this was not to be a successful partnership, and they split in 1972. After riding freelance for a bit, he was to become first jockey to trainer Sir Mark Prescott in 1974, a partnership which was to prove most enduring and fruitful. George Duffield spent 30 years as stable jockey to Prescott, riding 830 winners for him, including successes in Ireland, France and Belgium. Duffield was a journeyman jockey for a great part of his career, but he became much better known in 1992 thanks to the exploits of the three- year-old filly User Friendly, trained by Clive Brittain, also at Newmarket, User Friendly gave Duffield his first 'Classic' success when winning The Oaks, she followed up by winning the Irish Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks and St. Leger Stakes, before going down by a neck to Subotica in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Hippodrome de Longchamp.George Duffield MBEFriendly proves a class act Other big race victories included back to back Champion Stakes wins on the Prescott trained Alborada in 1998 and 1999, as well as landing major gambles on the Prescott trained handicapper Pasternak in the 1997 John Smith's Magnet Cup and Cambridgeshire Handicap. George was also used by Aidan O'Brien, and had two Group 1 victories for the Ballydoyle stable, when winning the 1999 Racing Post Trophy on Aristotle and the 2000 Eclipse Stakes on Giant's Causeway.Duffield's verve undimmed by venerability He had previously won the Eclipse Stakes in 1991 on the 28-1 chance Environment Friend.

George Duffield also entered the Guinness Book of Records in 1980, for winning 11 consecutive races (and 13 in all) on the brave two-year-old Spindrifter. He was awarded the MBE in 2003 for his services to British Horse Racing. His autobiography Gentleman George was published in 2002; in it, he admitted punching BHB chairman Peter Savill during a row at Beverley. In total he rode 2,547 winners placing him at No. 10 in the all-time list in Britain, he twice rode over 100 winners in a season, the first time in 1992, but his best season in terms of winners was in 1993 when he had 116 successes. His last winner was in 2004, although he did not announce his retirement until the following year after failing to recover from a shoulder injury. He was for many years before his retirement the oldest jockey in Britain, well liked by fellow jockeys, trainers, owners (perhaps excepting Peter Savill) and punters alike.

It was passed during the Emergency of 1975-1977. It was moved by the Congress government headed by Indira Gandhi to preempt a hearing by Supreme Court of India concerning the setting aside of Gandhi's election by the Allahabad High Court on the grounds of corrupt electoral practices. Background Indira Gandhi was accused by Raj Narain for misusing the state machinery during her election polls. After that, the Allahabad High court did find her guilty, by virtue of which dismissed her immediately from the Lok Sabha. The high court also barred her from contesting in future elections for 6 years and demanded her resignation from PM post. Indira Gandhi appealed to the supreme court the same day and her case was accepted. The court granted her bail and allowed her to remain as Prime minister for 6 more months within which the said case would be completed, yet refused to reinstate her as a member of Parliament. Facing certain doom if the case went on in the supreme court as before, Indira Gandhi successfully recommended to the President to declare a state of emergency the next night and began her rule by decree. During this time, Indira Gandhi pushed for the thirty ninth amendment act to secure her position and prevent her removal from Indian politics. She also went ahead bringing about the forty second amendment act that included clause four and five of article 368, removing all restriction regarding the amendment power of the parliament and providing that amendments were not contestable in any court of law in India. Later on in the Minerva Mills v. Union of India case, the 39th amendment was removed and the Doctrine of Basic Structure was reinforced from the Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala case.

As the compulsion to sleep intensifies, the ability to complete tasks sharply diminishes, often mimicking the appearance of intoxication. During occasional unique and/or stimulating circumstances, a person with EDS can sometimes remain animated, awake and alert, for brief or extended periods of time. EDS can affect the ability to function in family, social, occupational, or other settings. A proper diagnosis of the underlying cause and ultimately treatment of symptoms and/or the underlying cause can help mitigate such complications.  Causes  EDS can be a symptom of a number of factors and disorders. Specialists in sleep medicine are trained to diagnose them. Some are: * insufficient quality or quantity of night time sleep; * misalignments of the body's circadian pacemaker with the environment (e.g., jet lag, shift work, or other circadian rhythm sleep disorders); * another underlying sleep disorder, such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnia, or restless legs syndrome; * disorders such as clinical depression or atypical depression; * tumors, head trauma, anemia, kidney failure, hypothyroidism, or an injury to the central nervous system; * drug abuse; * genetic predisposition; * vitamin deficiency, such as biotin deficiency; and * particular classes of prescription and over- the-counter medication.  Diagnosis  An adult who is compelled to nap repeatedly during the day may have excessive daytime sleepiness; however, it is important to distinguish between occasional daytime sleepiness and excessive daytime sleepiness, which is chronic. A number of tools for screening for EDS have been developed. One is the Epworth Sleepiness Scale which grades the results of a questionnaire. The ESS generates a numerical score from zero (0) to 24 where a score of ten [10] or higher may indicate that the person should consult a specialist in sleep medicine for further evaluation. Another tool is the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), which has been used since the 1970s. It is used to measure the time it takes from the start of a daytime nap period to the first signs of sleep, called sleep latency. The test is based on the idea that the sleepier people are, the faster they will fall asleep. The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is also used to quantitatively assess daytime sleepiness. This test is performed in a sleep diagnostic center. The test is similar to the MSLT. However, during this test the patient is instructed to try to stay awake.  Treatment  Treatment of EDS relies on identifying and treating the underlying disorder which may cure the person from the EDS. Drugs like modafinil, Armodafinil, Xyrem (sodium oxybate) oral solution, have been approved as treatment for EDS symptoms in the U.S. There is declining usage of other drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), amphetamine (Adderall), lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse), methamphetamine (Desoxyn), and pemoline (Cylert), as these psychostimulants may have several adverse effects and may lead to dependency, especially when illicitly misused.

Biography Mortensen spent his formative years in Green Bay, Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìGreen Bay in 2001 and spent time working with his father at the family-owned Jones Sign Nationwide, where he gained an appreciation of his ability to make others laugh. While he has said his job at Jones Sign was \\"incredible,\\" he regarded his position with unease, feeling it based on nepotism. Eager to see if his own talents could net him recognition, he began performing comedy in 2004 on a visit to Madison, Wisconsin. Within a year he had collaborated on a group for young stand up comedians called the WiSUC Project, short for \\"Wisconsin Stand-Up Comedy Project\\", and won their first ever comedy contest. In 2007 Mortensen moved to Madison. Recent events Nick ran into some trouble in June 2007 with the Madison Comedy Club as the result of a front-page article in Madison's The Capital Times where he was quoted as saying \\"The club here (in Madison, WI) is super cool and a pleasure to work at, but generally speaking, comedy clubs are where comedians and comedy itself goes to die.\\" . The Madison Comedy Club subsequently canceled his future bookings with the club and erased his profile from the comedians section on their website.  Packers blog  In November 2006, Mortensen was hired to blog about his hometown Green Bay Packers at Packers fan blog Nitschke.

It is written in Old East Norse and is included in Codex Runicus, a transcript of Scanian Law where it forms a final note. Like the law itself, it is written in runes, and the tune is written on two simple staves in an early form of musical notation. The song is sung in episode 6 of Vikings.  Song text  The text of the song is :Dr√∏mde mik en dr√∏m i nat um :silki ok √¶rlik p√¶l There are several interpretations of the text, as the meaning of the words silki and √¶rlik p√¶l is obscure. Traditionally, most interpretations have been variants on these readings: :*I dreamt a dream last night of silk and fine fur :*I dreamt a dream last night of silk and expensive cloth This interpretation takes the 13th-century word silki to mean silk. It may be compared with the medieval song \\"Palle Boosons visa\\" which also speaks of \\"silk and fine fur\\": \\"Han kl√§der sig i silke, s√• och i √§del p√§ll..\\". Adolf Iwar Arwidsson, Svenska Forns√•nger, f√∂rsta delen sid 199, in swedish This interpretation has been called into question, because it fails to take account of the context of the document.√Öke Persson och Johannes Holmqvist, Runtenom 2003-4 sid 6 Codex Runicus is a lawbook that ends with a text of marginal notes. Since the song appears to be written in the same hand that completed the main body of the manuscript, it would seem more appropriate if the lyrics of the song were connected with the content of the document. One would expect a text concerning law and order rather than luxury. However, there are many examples of similar insertions of unrelated text into medieval European documents, a particularly notable one being the Old Irish poem Pangur B√°n. Alternative interpretations that better fit with this understanding of the song's context are: :*I dreamt a dream last night of justice and fair play :*I dreamt a dream last night of equality and honest measure The word silki could be seen as related to the old Nordic word slik meaning equality or the same as.Corpus iuris Sueo-Gotorum antiqui: Samling af Sweriges gamla lagar, pages 288, 294, 314, 319, in Swedish Likewise, √Ürlik p√¶l could be \\"honest measure\\", since p√¶l and pel, are old words for \\"measure\\", cognate with German Pegel.German Wikipedia: Pegel (Wasserstandsmessung) √Ürlik is used meaning \\"honest\\" (cf. \\"√¶rlig\\" in Modern Danish) on the very first page of the Codex Runicus.  Musical notes  :Image:dromde mik en drom.jpg Whilst there is general agreement on the notes of the melody (except for ligatures), a variety of rhythmical interpretations are possible.More interpretations are found at FolkWiki Tobias Norlind believed it to be an early version of Staffansvisan, a song about Saint Stephen that is known in several versions and is still commonly sung in Sweden as part of the Lucia celebrations in December each year. However, Norlind did not attempt to interpret the rhythmical structure of the song. For many years, a version of the tune was used in breaks between programmes on Danmarks Radio. In this version, the first half of the tune has been interpreted as trochee: :Image:dromde mik en drom1.jpg Another interpretation based on rhythmical structures common in older traditional music, gives us a standard dance tune consisting of four plus four bars:√Öke Persson, Runtenom 2000-1 sid 7, in swedish :Image:dromde mik en drom2.jpg  References  Category:14th-century songs Category:Danish culture Category:Scania ","title":"Dr√∏mde mik en dr√∏m i nat"},{"id":"7183237","text":"The Grand Larousse encyclop√©dique en dix volumes (\\"Big Larousse encyclopedia in ten volumes\\") is a French encyclopedic dictionary published by Larousse between February 1960 and August 1964,Grand Larousse encyclop√©dique en dix volumes worldcat.org, 2013.

The concept was developed in 1989 by RECLUS, a group of French geographers managed by Roger Brunet. It stretches approximately from North Wales through the English Midlands across Greater London to the Benelux states and along the German Rhineland, Southern Germany, Alsace in France in the west and Switzerland (Basel and Z√ºrich) to Northern Italy (Milan) in the south. History Population density in Europe in 1994, showing the highest density along the blue Banana The French geographer Roger Brunet, who observed a division between \\"active\\" and \\"passive\\" spaces, developed the concept of a West European \\"backbone\\" in 1989. He made reference to an urban corridor of industry and services stretching from northern England to northern Italy. The name \\"Blue Banana\\" was dually coined by Jacques Ch√©r√®que, and an artist adding a graphic to an article by Josette Alia in Le Nouvel Observateur. The color blue referred to either the flag of the European Community, or the blue collars of factory workers in the region. Brunet saw the \\"European Backbone\\" as the development of historical precedents, e.g. trade routes, or as the consequence of an accumulation of industrial capital. In his analysis Brunet excluded the Paris urban area and other French conurbations because of French economic insularity. His aim was a greater economic integration in Europe, but he felt that France had lost this connection by the 17th century as a result of its persecution of Huguenots and centralisation in Paris. Later versions do, however, include Paris. In 1991, in the context of a study on behalf of the European Commission in support of its Regional Policy, researchers criticized the idea of the Blue Banana as a desirable formation, but not its empirical reality, identifying it as the result of regional competition in Europe. Furthermore, their diagram of the Blue Banana had more of a curve, still including Northern Italy, but ending at Barcelona. It also included Paris, and had the Anglo-Scottish border as its northern stem. A study of the history of the Blue Banana as a concept refers to the Commission's study as a mistaken rejection of the Blue Banana from Brunet's original conception. From the research on the Commission's behalf, the Blue Banana represented a developed core at the expense of the periphery, whereas Brunet empirically viewed the Blue Banana as a region of development at Paris's periphery, beyond the French borders.

During his early years he worked with oncology and neurophysiology researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Yale University and at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. As an undergraduate he ran the classical music program at WYBC, a commercial radio station, and founded The New Theater Company where he produced and directed numerous plays. Paulson graduated with a BA in French Literature and Literary Criticism from Yale University in 1981, and attended the Yale School of Drama. From 1982 to 86 he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing novels; from 1987 to 93 he lived in Paris, London and Milan, shooting fashion and advertising photography. During this period he co-founded (with Gilles Dusein) the Paris conceptual photography gallery Urbi et Orbi, and co-founded (with Kurt Novack) a graphic design studio, Pourriture Noble.

History Following the success of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway (D&KR;), which opened on 17 December 1834, proposals for a second commuter railway were put forward. These plans proposed the building of a railway from Bray, which opened on 10 July 1854 to initially terminate at Harcourt Road. (Harcourt Street Station was not built until 1859). The building of the line was carried out by two railway companies: The Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway (DW&WR;), who built the line from Dundrum to Bray and the Dublin, Dundrum and Rathfarnham Railway (DD&RR;), who were to build the line from Harcourt Street to Dundrum. The latter failed to do so, and the DW&WR; took over the line works. On 14 February 1900, a train from Enniscorthy failed to stop and went through the buffers and the end wall of the station, sending debris over Hatch Street. Nobody was killed, though the driver, William Hyland, had his right arm amputated at the scene. Another serious accident occurred on 23 December 1957 when two trains collided in thick fog just south of Dundrum station. The first train had slowed to a walking pace because of a cow on the line. The second train was allowed into the same section of track due to an error by the signalman. Its driving cab was completely destroyed in the collision and the driver, Andrew Larkin, was killed instantly. Drumm battery powered 2-car sets were in service between 1932 and 1949. In the 1950s, diesel railcars gradually replaced steam in an effort to improve journey times as many passengers had by then forsaken the line due to a significant increase in private car ownership. CIE were also rapidly expanding their then new bus services in and around the railway. Route The route, which was double tracked by 1862, ran south, initially from a temporary terminus on Harcourt Road. It served the intermediate stations of Dundrum, Stillorgan, Carrickmines and Shankill. The new Harcourt Street station opened on 7 February 1859, along with a temporary platform at Foxrock. Further new stations followed; Milltown (1860), Foxrock (1861), Rathmines & Ranelagh (1896, renamed Ranelagh in 1921). In 1915, due to coastal erosion, the Westland Row line was moved inland south of Killiney, joining the Harcourt St. Line at the new relocated Shanganagh Junct. The line continued to Woodbrook Halt (1910), which served the cricket ground on Sir Stanley Cochrane's Woodbrook estate. The Woodbrook Golf Club and Cricket Grounds later used this halt between 1920 and 1960. The summit of the line was at Lakelands between Dundrum and Stillorgan. One of the major engineering feats on the line was the Milltown Viaduct, or Nine Arches, which still stands today over the River Dodder. The 5-arched Bride's Glen viaduct spans the Loughlinstown River valley and Bride's Glen Rd.

Image:ninearches1909.jpg|The Nine Arches Bridge as shown in a 1909 postcard. Decision to close Following the Beddy Report of 1957, CI√â decided to close all the non-profitable rural railway branch lines including the Harcourt Street line. In October 1958, CI√â gave public notice of the closure. Many objections were raised by local people but to no avail. The last train, CI√â 2600 Class AEC railcar number 2652, left Harcourt Street at 4:25pm on 31 December 1958. One interesting event that occurred was that when this train began crossing The Nine Arches Viaduct between Milltown and Dundrum, the staff of the nearby laundry turned out in force and blew sirens as the train crossed the viaduct for the last time. Following the closure, many of the stations were sold by public auction. The tracks were lifted between 1 January 1959 and September 1960. Legacy The route corridor remained mostly in place until the 2000s. The section between Grand Parade and the old Stillorgan station at Sandyford was chosen for use by the Luas light rail system whose Green Line opened in 2004. The line crosses the Dundrum bypass on the new William Dargan cable-stayed bridge. An extension of the Luas to Cherrywood opened for passenger service on Saturday 16 October 2010, using most of the old railway alignment. The route leaves the old alignment after the Sandyford Depot, crosses the M50 motorway and runs down Ballyogan Road, before crossing the M50 again, and re-joining the original alignment before the Carrickmines station. The Railway Procurement Agency announced in 2009 that the Brennanstown stop would not open due to lack of local development. Beyond Brennanstown, the route diverges slightly from the old alignment and enters a new tunnel, before ending at the Brides Glen Luas stop in Cherrywood Business Park. Visible remains Several bridges, stations and much of the alignment have survived. These include the Harcourt Street Station, Dundrum, Stillorgan, Carrickmines and Shankill stations, Woodbrook Halt, the Nine Arches and Bride's Glen viaducts. Little trace of Foxrock railway station remains as the building was demolished in 1991, other than the original passenger entrance to Leopardstown Racecourse beside the golf club main gates.

Work in 1862, prior to the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. The song is pro-Unionist, and the lyrics are sung from the point of view of slaves in Confederate territory, who celebrate their impending freedom after their master flees the approach of Union military forces. They speculate on the future fate of the owner, whom they suspect will pretend to be a runaway slave in order to avoid capture. With their owner absent, the slaves revolt, locking their overseer in a cellar as retribution for his harsh treatment toward them. The slaves then celebrate their impending emancipation by Union soldiers by drinking their absent owner's cider and wine in his kitchen. Work also wrote the song \\"Babylon is Fallen\\" (\\"Don't you see the black clouds risin' ober yonder\\") which sees the American Civil War from the perspective of the black U.S. soldiers fighting for the Union. History The lyrics of \\"Kingdom Coming\\" are written in an exaggerated dialect that Work presumably believed was typical of Southern blacks, and the words are now rarely sung. Instead, the tune is usually played as a lively instrumental, as in the Ken Burns documentary The Civil War. It is often heard in productions with Western or rustic settings that have nothing specifically to do with the Civil War. Sample lyrics > :Say, darkies, hab you seen de massa, wid de muffstash on his face, :Go long > de road some time dis mornin', like he gwine to leab de place? :He seen a > smoke way up de ribber, whar de Linkum gunboats lay; :He took his hat, and > lef' berry sudden, and I spec' he's run away!

In popular culture Cartoons The 1928 Mickey Mouse short The Gallopin' Gaucho opens and closes with music from the song. The song became the opening music for the character Pooch the Pup, starting with the 1932 cartoon The Under Dog. \\"Kingdom Coming\\" appears in two MGM animated cartoons directed by Tex Avery, The Three Little Pups,Whistling Wolf from \\"Droopy Dog (1953) The Three Little Pups\\" YouTube (with Droopy) and Billy Boy, as well as in Michael Lah's Blackboard Jumble and Sheep Wrecked. The piece is whistled throughout all four pictures by a dimwitted wolf character voiced by Daws Butler (using the same slow Southern drawl he would later employ for Huckleberry Hound). This wolf character has no official name, but is commonly referred to as \\"Jubilo Wolf\\", in reference to \\"Year of Jubilo\\". It also occasionally appears in Warner Bros. cartoons, such as being used throughout the 1938 Porky Pig cartoon Injun Trouble and its 1945 remake Wagon Heels, and the closing scenes of the 1945 Bugs Bunny cartoons The Unruly Hare and Hare Trigger. Films In Too Busy To Work (1932), Jubilo (Will Rogers) sings the song to his daughter Rose (Marion Nixon). In The Telegraph Trail (1933), John Trent (John Wayne) whistles this tune. It is instrumental background music in The Horse Soldiers (1959) (also starring Wayne). (Hear the second piece in the trailer at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knQahiIpwYw). In Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Esther Smith (Judy Garland) sings new lyrics, written for the movie, to the tune of \\"Year of Jubilo\\". The lyrics are in standard English and are inoffensive, with no reference to slavery, the Civil War, or any other controversial subject.

SANCCOB conserves and protect South Africa's sea birds, especially threatened species, for the benefit of present and future generations. The organization was founded in November 1968 in response to an increase in oiling of penguins on South African coasts, connected to higher tanker traffic following the closure of the Suez Canal after the Six-Day War. It admitted between 200 and 2,000 birds per year during 1969‚Äì1993, almost all of which were African penguins. Since 1983, SANCCOB has handled more than 35,000 oiled penguins. The vast majority of these penguins were oiled in the Apollo Sea spill (1994) and the Treasure spill (2000). As the latter event also necessitated the precautionary evacuation of 19,500 un-oiled birds, almost a quarter of the global population was handled at that time. From 1990 to 2005, an average of 750 oiled penguins have been admitted annually from oiling events other than these two spills. In total, SANCCOB has handled over 85,000 seabirds since its inception. A modeling exercise by the University of Cape Town's Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology found that rehabilitating oiled African penguins has resulted in the current population being 19 percent larger than it would have been in the absence of SANCCOB's rehabilitation efforts.

The program was televised in Atlanta on WATL-TV and, later, WTCG-TV (later WTBS-TV, now WPCH- TV).  History  In 1968 and 1969, veteran broadcaster Bob Whitney experimented with a new concept in television programming, in which the hit Top 40 songs of the day were coupled with the latest in the era's videotaping and filming techniques. The resulting pilot enlisted the studio facilities of several stations: WFAA-TV in Dallas, Texas, WHBQ-TV Memphis, Tennessee, WKBS- TV Philadelphia and KMBC-TV in Kansas City. Location scenes were filmed at station studios or at locations within a short distance from these facilities. Whitney's aim was to create a cost-effective television program that would emulate the success of Top 40 radio, all the way down to the use of an unseen disk jockey. The concept was born about ten years before the arrival of MTV. In 1970, The Now Explosion began its first regular broadcasts on Atlanta's WATL-TV, where it aired 28 hours each weekend. By this time, the show was produced at WATL's studios. Programs were bicycled to stations on 2 inch videotape and played back for extended periods from one to six hours. WPIX-TV in New York played five hours of The Now Explosion surrounding telecasts of New York Yankees baseball games in 1970. Stations in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Sacramento and Boston had also picked up The Now Explosion. After 13 weeks at WATL, Ted Turner contracted to carry the program for a television station he had recently acquired, WTCG-TV. WATL closed down shortly afterward. While it was unclear whether or not the show contributed to WATL's viewership, it has been said by some that many of their viewers only watched WATL for The Now Explosion. The move had also shifted production of The Now Explosion to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where Whitney established a new home production base. Program segments were produced at Miami Teleproductions in Miami and 2 inch video editing was undertaken at Videotape Associates in Ft. Lauderdale (now VTA of Atlanta). After 26 weeks in syndication in early 1971, Whitney cancelled The Now Explosion, when the high costs of production and distribution outpaced the commercial revenue. Turner would once again enter the music video television business with the debut of Night Tracks in 1983 which lasted nine years and Cable Music Channel (albeit for only a month) in 1984.  Special effects  The special effects used in The Now Explosion were crude but state of the art for the early 1970s era. Video was shot with heavy, non portable studio cameras on large rolling tripods. The music videos were recorded on two inch magnetic tape. The video editing required the use of three massive and costly \\"quad\\" tape recorders allowing only simple transitions such as cuts and dissolves. Most performers were young amateurs recruited from the Atlanta audience. Many appeared with home-grown costumes - often after midnight when station facilities became available - and were recorded dancing extemporaneously as rock rhythms were piped into an almost bare and darkened studio. The lighting often placed performers \\"in limbo\\" so that only the illuminated dancers were seen against darkened studio walls. Extensive special effects were added in post production as images were combined and distorted to form what production people often called \\"eye candy.\\" Common special effects included aiming the camera into a monitor that said camera is connected to - a technique called \\"video feedback.\\" The original video and the newly captured pictures from the monitor were combined with a video switcher to create an \\"infinity\\" effect as same video repeated itself in a seemingly endless visual loop. Changes in position or angle of the cameras were used to create trails of light which seemed to spill off dancers in a manner interpreted by many as \\"psychedelic.\\" Producers felt the distorted video of moving bodies, often seeming to float in space, and moving \\"in tune\\" to pop songs, created enhanced enjoyment for viewers. Other images and effects came from an Atlanta 1960's style light show venture called the \\"Electric Collage.\\" The Electric Collage production company was popular at major rock concerts and rock festivals. Collage operators were able to produce complex lighting effects with projectors that were not possible using the video technology of the day. The Now Explosion had collage technicians create light effect images on a studio screen while videographers captured the effects with multiple studio cameras. Often these lightshow enhancements were combined with studio dance videos in later production before final programs were assembled on tape for broadcast and distribution.  Archive recovery  In 2000, The Walter J. Brown Media Archives and Peabody Awards Archives at University of Georgia in Athens located and recovered significant amounts of this video which had been stored for 3 decades in south Florida. These segments were remastered to contemporary technical standards by the university archives where the video is stored and is available for public viewing and academic study.

It stands in contrast to an outcome reported by someone else, such as a physician-reported outcome, a nurse-reported outcome, and so on. PRO methods, such as questionnaires, are used in clinical trials or other clinical settings, to help better understand a treatment's efficacy or effectiveness. The use of digitized PROs, or electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), is on the rise in today's health research setting. Terminology PROs should not be confused with PCOs, or patient-centered outcomes. The latter implies the use of a questionnaire covering issues and concerns that are specific to a patient. Instead, patient-reported outcomes refers to reporting situations in which only the patient provides information related to a specific treatment or condition; this information may or may not be of concern to the patient. Further, PROs should not be confused with PREMs (patient reported experience measures), which focus more on a patient's overall experience versus a focus on specific treatment outcomes. The term PROs is becoming increasingly synonymous with \\"patient reported outcome measures\\" (PROMs). Overview PRO is an umbrella term that covers a whole range of potential measurements, but it specifically refers to \\"self- reporting\\" by the patient. PRO data may be collected via self-administered questionnaires, which the patient completes themselves, or through patient interviews. The latter will only qualify as a PRO, however, if the interviewer is gaining the patient's views and not using the responses to make a professional assessment or judgment of the impact of a treatment on the patient's condition. Thus, PROs are used as a means of gathering patient- rather than clinical- or other outcomes perspectives. The patient-reported perspective can be an important asset in gaining treatment or drug approval. There is no incentive for patients to report their outcome data other than to \\"pay it forward\\" to the community and help the health industry prevent unnecessary suffering in other patients. Characteristics A well-designed PRO questionnaire should assess either a single underlying characteristic or, where it addresses multiple characteristics, should be a number of scales that each address a single characteristic. These measurement \\"characteristics\\" are termed constructs and the questionnaires used to collect them, termed instruments, measures, scales or tools. Typically, PRO tools must undergo extensive validation and testing. A questionnaire that measures a single construct is described as unidimensional. Items (questions) in a unidimensional questionnaire can be added to provide a single scale score. However, it cannot be assumed that a questionnaire is unidimensional simply because the author intended it to be. This must be demonstrated empirically (for example, by confirmatory factor analysis or Rasch analysis). A questionnaire that measures multiple constructs is termed multi-dimensional. A multi-dimensional questionnaire is used to provide a profile of scores; that is, each scale is scored and reported separately. It is possible to create an overall (single summary) score from a multi-dimensional measure using factor analysis or preference-based methods but some may see this as akin to adding apples and oranges together. Questionnaires may be generic (designed to be used in any disease population and cover a broad aspect of the construct measured) or condition-targeted (developed specifically to measure those aspects of outcome that are of importance for a people with a particular medical condition). The most commonly used PRO questionnaires assess one of the following constructs: * Symptoms (impairments) and other aspects of well- being * Functioning (disability) * Health status * General health perceptions * Quality of life (QoL) * Health related quality of life (HRQoL) * Reports and Ratings of health care. Measures of symptoms may focus on a range of impairments or on a specific impairment such as depression or pain. Measures of functioning assess activities such as personal care, activities of daily living and locomotor activities. Health-related quality of life instruments are generally multi-dimensional questionnaires assessing a combination of aspects of impairments and/or disability and reflect a patient's health status. In contrast, QoL goes beyond impairment and disability by asking about the patient's ability to fulfill their needs and also about their emotional response to their restrictions. A new generation of short and easy-to-use tools to monitor patient outcomes on a regular basis has been recently proposed. These tools are quick, effective, and easy to understand, as they allow patients to evaluate their health status and experience in a semi- structured way and accordingly aggregate input data, while automatically tracking their physio-emotional sensitivity. As part of the National Institute of Health's Roadmap Initiative, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) uses modern advances in psychometrics such as item response theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to create highly reliable and validated measurement tools. Validation and quality assessment It is essential that a PRO instrument satisfy certain development, psychometric and scaling standards if it is to provide useful information (e.g.). Specifically, measures should have a sound theoretical basis and should be relevant to the patient group with which they are to be used. They should also be reliable and valid (including responsive to underlying change) and the structure of the scale (whether it possesses a single or multiple domains) should have been thoroughly tested using appropriate methodology in order to justify the use of scale or summary scores. The validation of the PRO measures should incorporate not only short- term but also long-term success in order to be able to reflect sustainability of interventions. Classic examples of such tools and methods are noted in commonly used oncology tools, such as FACT or EORTC tools. These standards must be maintained throughout every target language population. In order to ensure that developmental standards are consistent in translated versions of a PRO instrument, the translated instrument undergoes a process known as Linguistic validation in which the preliminary translation is adapted to reflect cultural and linguistic differences between diverse target populations. Preference-based Preference-based PROs can be used for the computation of a quality-adjusted life year. A preference based PRO has an algorithm attached to the PRO instrument which can 'weigh' the outcomes reported by patients according to the preferences for health outcomes of a group of individuals such as the general public or of patient groups. The purpose of this 'weighing' is to make sure that elements of health that are very important receive larger weight when computing sum scores. For example, individuals may consider problems with their mood to be more important than limitations in usual activities. Examples of generic preference-based PROs are the Health Utilities Index and the EQ-5D. Condition-targeted preference-based PROs also exist, but there are some questions regarding their comparability to generic PROs when used for the computation of Quality Adjusted Life Years. Examples Many of the common generic PRO tools assess health-related quality of life or patient evaluations of health care. For example, the SF-36 Health Survey, SF-12 Health Survey, Profile, the Nottingham Health Profile, the Health Utilities Index, the Quality of Well-Being Scale, the EuroQol (EQ-5D), and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey instruments are PRO instruments. Condition-targeted tools may capture any of the constructs listed above, depending on the purpose for which they were designed. Examples include the Adult Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument, National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire, Epilepsy Surgery Inventory, Migraine Specific Quality of Life (MSQOL), the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life questionnaire (ASQoL) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), to name a few.  PROMS in the AJRR  The American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) launched their Level III patient-reported outcome (PRO) platform in November 2015 and switched to a new version created and hosted by Ortech Systems in 2016. AJRR imports the PRO data into the AJRR‚Äôs Demand Reporting & Electronic Dashboard system. Clinical staff is able to access patient data while having the ability to manage PRO surveys electronically via a secure patient portal. The AJRR Dashboard system can also pull site-specific patient reports and summary results for each PRO measure supported on the AJRR system. AJRR collaborated with several orthopaedic organizations to identify the specific measures that AJRR should recommend and that may be used as national benchmarks. Even though specific measures are recommended, AJRR understands that some institutions may have in place a long-standing PRO data collection process. Participating hospitals are able to submit and retrieve these alternative measures, but there will not be national benchmarks available for them. PROMs in the NHS Since 1 April 2009 all providers of care funded by the National Health Service (NHS) in England have been required to provide patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in four elective surgical procedures: hip replacement, knee replacement, varicose vein surgery and hernia surgery. Patients are asked to complete a questionnaire before undergoing the surgical procedure; a follow-up questionnaire is then sent to the patient some weeks or months later. Patient participation is, however, not compulsory. In December 2013 a team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reviewed the first three years of NHS PROMs data which captured responses from more than 50,000 patients who underwent groin hernia repair, varicose vein surgery or hip or knee replacements. They found \\"no grounds to suggest we should start cutting the amount of surgery we are doing\\". In drug licensing and label claims Patient-reported outcomes are important in a regulatory context. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued formal Guidance to Industry on PROs in label claims and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has produced a reflection paper on HRQoL. Increasing numbers of regulatory submissions for new drugs provide PRO data to support claims. DeMuro et al. (2013) have reviewed drug approvals for the years 2006‚Äì2010. They showed that of 75 drugs approved by both agencies, 35 (47%) had at last one PRO-related claim approved by the EMA compared to 14 (19%) for the FDA. The FDA was more likely to approve claims for symptom reduction, while the EMA approved relatively more claims for improvement in functioning or HrQoL. PROMs in Multimodal Pain Therapy Operationalizing success in multi-modal pain therapy is a challenge and is up to now characterized by tremendous heterogeneity. There are efforts to define core sets of patient-relevant outcome variables to be measured in clinical trials in general and for multi-modal pain therapy. Meanwhile, a core outcome measure set based on PROMS was developed with routine data and validated for operationalizing success in multimodal pain therapy. Validation studies suggest also suitability for depicting long-term success in the sense of sustainability of treatment effects.  PROMs in Epilepsy in Rural Maharashtra, India  Epilepsy accounts for a significant proportion of the world's disease burden, affecting 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. The prevalence of epilepsy in Maharashtra is estimated to be 1 million people. Epilepsy Foundation of India has been providing free diagnosis and treatment to people living with epilepsy across rural Maharashtra since 2011. Since 2018, they have been using MedEngage services to collect PROs from thousands of patients across the state. Patients use a zero- cost helpline to report outcomes every 2‚Äì3 months related to adherence, medicine availability, seizure frequency, healthcare related quality of life, and a few other parameters. All PROMs are analyzed to help guide public policy and optimize resource allocation for people living with epilepsy in Maharashtra.  Relationship to other data  The term Patient Reported Health Data was also introduced in 2018 to include patient reported data that are not outcomes (e.g., patient reported comorbidities, medications, hospitalizations).

In 1928 the family built a home, featuring guest houses, a triangular elevator, a bowling alley, and a sunken garden. The home features a Mediterranean villa style that somewhat resembles buildings at the nearby University of Texas. In 1944 the Perry family moved to the Driskill Hotel and sold the home to Herman Heep. In 1948 the estate opened as a school for the first time, housing St. Mary's Academy for Girls, which had been founded in 1874 and moved from its historic downtown location. At that time a chapel, nun's quarters, and other buildings were added. In 1968, the coed Holy Cross High School replaced the girls' academy.Marlene Joseph Glade, \\"St. Mary's Academy, Austin\\", Handbook of Texas Online (accessed 2013-04-17). In 1974, the land was purchased by the Henderson family, who founded the private Perry School on the site. In the mid-1990s, the land passed to the Sri Atmananda Memorial School.

Biography Early life and education He was born on 13 September 1899 at Peki-Avetile (also called Abenase) in the Peki Traditional Area of the Volta Region and as a male child born on a Wednesday was called Kwaku. His father was Stephen Amuyaa, a wood carver who was popularly called Papa Stefano. His mother was Sarah Akoram Ama. Ephraim K…îku Amu was baptised by the Rev. Rudolf Mallet on 22 October 1899. Amu first went to school in May 1906 and at about age 12 he entered the Peki-Blengo E.P. Boarding Middle School, where he showed much interest and love for music and agriculture. According to him, he enjoyed the music played during church collections when the music teacher, Mr Karl Theodore Ntem, played soul-moving renditions on the organ. Amu and his music teacher struck a mutual agreement whereby Amu requested to be taught the skills of organ playing and in return Mr Ntem asked him to work on his farm on Saturdays. In 1915, Amu passed the standard 7 School Leaving Certificate examination and also passed the Abetifi Teachers Seminary'S Examination. In 1916 he and two other colleagues had to walk 150 miles from Peki to Abetifi with their boxes on their heads to start teacher training education. On their journey, they had to rest at several points, including Koforidua, Nkawkaw, Asubone and Obomen. Amu joined 25 other newcomers at the college. While at the college, Amu realised that some of the students, including his classmates, owned steel bicycles so he set himself the task of building his own bicycle from wood, carving it from a wooden slab in the bush near the college. Students who discovered his handiwork brought it into the open and named it Amu. It is on record that even the son of the Swiss principal, Stern, enjoyed many rides on the Amu wooden cycle. Amu also used his ingenuity and creativity to carve wooden balls for the school games, which replaced the imported balls being used at the time at the seminary. Amu completed his four-year teacher-catechist training in 1919. Newly graduating teacher-catechist, he was one of the two preachers selected to mount the pulpit on behalf of their fellow mates, as was customary to preach and to express their appreciation to their tutors and townsfolk. The sermon also served as an assessment of the quality of the theological training that had been offered to the students. Amu chose the sermon text from Matthew 25:40 on this occasion. His theme was ‚Äúthe Lord will thank you for all the good you have done for his little ones‚Äù. Amu used both Twi and Ewe in his short sermon. Work and music By the time Amu completed his training, motor vehicles were more common so he could travel from Abetifi to Osino and travel by train to Koforidua, then take a motor vehicle to Frankadua. He made the remainder of the journey on foot from Frankadua to Peki, a distance of 18 miles. From 1 January 1920, Amu took up an appointment as a teacher at Peki-Blengo E.P. Middle Boarding School, where he taught songs and was keen on making his pupils able to read music well. He went to Koforidua to buy a five-octave Henry Riley folding organ for the school. He faced the problem of carrying the organ to Peki. After successfully reaching Frankadua by motor vehicle, he had to carry the organ on his head and walk the distance all night, arriving at Peki the following morning. Eager to master his skills in music, Amu took music lessons with Rev. Allotey-Pappoe, a Methodist Minister stationed at Peki-Avetile. Amu composed several musical pieces, among them: #\\"Fare thee well\\" #\\"Maw…î d…î na Yesu\\" #\\"Nkwagye Dwom\\" #\\"Dwonto\\" #\\"Yetu Osa\\" #\\"Israel Hene\\" #\\"Onipa da wo ho so\\" #\\"Yaanom Abibirimma\\" #\\"Yen Ara Asaase Ni\\" (Twi version of Mia denyigba l…îÃÉl…îÃÉ la) #\\"Mia denyigba l…îÃÉl…îÃÉ la\\" (Original Ewe Version) #\\"Adawura abo me\\" #\\"Samansuo\\" #\\"Alegbegbe Mawu L…îÃÉ Xexeame\\" #\\"Asem yi di ka\\" #\\"Akwaaba Ndwom\\" #\\"Mo Mma Yen Nk…îso Mforo\\" #\\"Enye Yen Nyame\\" #\\"Biako Ye\\" #\\"Bonwire Kente\\" #\\"Esrom Miele\\" #\\"Ko Na Kotutu\\" #\\"Adikanfo Mo\\" #\\"Mawue Na Me Mawue Ta Me\\" #\\"Dz…îdz…îeny…õny…õ\\" #\\"Amanson Twerampon\\" # \\"Tiri ne nsa ne kuma\\" Amu is particularly known for his use of the atenteben, a traditional Ghanaian bamboo flute; he promoted and popularized the instrument throughout the country, and composed music for it. African influence Of Amu's compositions, \\"Yen Ara Asase Ni\\" has become a nationally acclaimed patriotic song that is performed at national functions. From 1926 Amu was transferred on promotion to Presbyterian Mission Seminary at Akropong on the recommendation of the Synod Committee of the E ãe Presbyteria Hame. At Akropong, he was seen in his actions and ideas as unorthodox. As a tutor in charge of gardening he requested students to use night soil to manure the college farm. The students found this unpleasant since it was a taboo for an educated man to carry human excreta. To prove that example was better than precept he would carry the excreta to the college farm himself ahead of the unwilling students. Dr. Ephraim Amu employed no one to sweep his rooms, wash his plates or run errands for him. No manual work was too menial or hard for him. He believed in using African cultural artefacts and good African technological and social inventions. He preferred the title Owura to \\"mister\\" as a prefix to his name. Dr K…îku Ephraim Amu selected Twi names for the four new college dormitories that were completed in 1929. Upon request from Mr Ferguson, the Principal of Akropong Training college, Amu came out with a solfa and notation of the street song ‚ÄúYaa Amponsa‚Äù, set to his own chaste words. His students enjoyed the new song, melody and the new words. The street ballad \\"Yaa Amponsa\\" had new clothes and was popular with great appeal and appreciation. Amu learnt to speak correct Akuapem Twi from members of his singing band. The Akropong Church singing band specialised in Amu's type of African music during the period he led and taught the group. In 1927, inspired by the contents of Wasu, a journal published by the West African Students' Union, Amu decided that he would wear African dress with pride. He decided not to wear warm unsuitable European clothes in tropical Africa. He made efforts to make the Christian church service more meaningful to African worshippers who were ashamed of their African clothing, language, music and even their African names. As part of his ingenuity and creativity Amu introduced bamboo flutes - odurogyaba, odurogya and at…õt…õnb…õn. In 1931 after Amu preached wearing his African attire on a Sunday, he was summoned to appear before the church court. The Rev. Peter Hall told Amu, \\"We were taken aback to see you conduct Sunday service in a native cloth. We hope you will not do this again.\\" Amu therefore in his polite manner took leave of the church session but decided in his heart to continue to work in the church as a catechist and music teacher rather than to become a minister of the Gospel to accept wearing unsuitable European dress. In June 1942, Amu married Beatrice Yao and presented a wooden box made of the finest wood instead of an imported steel trunk to his bride. Dr Amu married at the ripe age of 43 on 3 September 1942. On Saturday, 27 March 1965, the University of Ghana conferred the honorary degree of Doctor of Music on Ephraim K…îku Amu at the University of Ghana, Legon.

The school was established in 1935 as the final location of the Foundling Hospital, a children's charity founded in London in 1739. The Berkhamsted building converted into a school in 1955. Ashlyns School is noted as an example of neo-Georgian architecture and is a Grade II listed building. History The original Foundling Hospital, London, in 1770 The Foundling Hospital was a charitable institution founded in 1739 by the philanthropic sea captain Thomas Coram to house and educate abandoned and orphaned children. It was established under royal charter by King George II and was supported by many noted figures of the day in high society and the arts. Artists such as William Hogarth, Joshua Reynolds, Allan Ramsay and Thomas Gainsborough all exhibited paintings at the Hospital, and the composer George Frederic Handel held benefit concerts in the Hospital chapel to raise funds, performing his specially composed Foundling Hospital Anthem and his oratorio Messiah. The Foundling Hospital was located in Lamb's Conduit Fields in Bloomsbury, an undeveloped, pastoral area of London. As the city expanded and became more polluted in the 19th century, the Hospital governors began to consider relocation to a healthier, more rural location. With the advent of the railways, travel outside the city was much easier. In 1926, the Foundling Hospital relocated temporarily to Redhill, Surrey, while a new, purpose-built school was constructed in Berkhamsted on land obtained from the Ashlyns Estate. The new building, designed by John Mortimer Sheppard in a neo-Georgian style and modelled on the original Foundling Hospital, opened in 1935. Following the reorganisation of schools under the Education Act 1944, the Foundling Hospital began to provide education under the name of Thomas Coram Schools, supported by a grant from Hertfordshire County Council. After the Children Act 1948 placed an obligation on local authorities to provide child welfare services, the emphasis in child care in Britain began to shift from residential institutions to foster care, with children living in local homes and attending local schools. In 1951 the Berkhamsted building became a secondary modern school, under the name Ashlyns School. For a time some children under the care of the charity continued to live in the school, but once they moved out after 1954, their dormitories on the first floor became class rooms. In 1955, after protracted negotiations, the Ashlyns School and the Foundling Hospital estate (including staff houses in Coram Close) were sold to Hertfordshire County Council for the sum of ¬£225,000. In the 1960s, Ashlyns became a comprehensive school. While Ashlyns School no longer fulfils a charitable function, the work of the Foundling Hospital is continued today by the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children (now known simply as Coram), a registered charity. In recent years, the school was awarded specialist school status as a Language College. On 19 December 2008 Headteacher Mr Dalziel resigned after 10 years in charge; he was replaced by Mr Gary Lewis from January to April 2009 and then he was replaced by Mr James Shapland, formerly Deputy Headteacher of Nicholas Breakspear School in St Albans. Filming location The school has been used for the setting of the film Son of Rambow which was primarily shot in the surrounding area of Berkhamsted and Ashridge Estate. Location filming has also taken place at Ashlyns for the BBC television drama Call the Midwife and the soap opera Eastenders. In 2013, the Australian rock band Tame Impala shot the music video for their single \\"Mind Mischief\\", from their album Lonerism, on the school premises. Architecture Neoclassical portico and clock tower of Ashlyns School chapel The school was constructed for the Foundling Hospital 1932‚Äì35 by the architect John Mortimer Sheppard. Set in extensive grounds, it is designed in a Neo-Georgian (Neoclassical) style, laid out as a symmetrical group of school buildings linked by colonnades of stone columns and organised around a courtyard. At the centre of the site, facing the entrance avenue, is the school chapel, topped with a tall cupola. The chapel is fronted by a large stone portico; four Doric columns support a large pediment which is emblazoned with the school coat of arms, consisting of an escutcheon depicting a baby and the moon and stars, and topped by crest of a lamb. It is flanked by a pair female supporters, the allegorical figures of Britannia and the eight-breasted Artemis of Ephesus. The motto is \\"Help\\". This heraldic device is similar to the arms of the original Foundling Hospital designed by William Hogarth. When it was opened, the chapel at Berkhamsted was fitted out with a number of fixtures and artefacts which had been transferred from the original Foundling Hospital Chapel in London, including a bust of the composer George Frederick Handel; the original 18th-century wooden pews, including the \\"Governors' pews\\"; several stained glass windows; the ornate iron communion rail; a baptismal font dating from 1804; a mid-nineteenth-century pulpit; and a number of 18th and 19th-century memorials, many of which made reference to burials in St George's, Bloomsbury, the parish church that stood next to the old Foundling Hospital. The chapel organ, which had been personally donated to the Foundling Hospital by George Frederick Handel in the 1750s, was also installed in the Berkhamsted chapel. It is thought that the organ casing was designed by the original Hospital architect, Theodore Jacobsen. The bodily remains of the founder, Thomas Coram, were placed in a tomb in a memorial crypt. Nikolaus Pevsner also mentions the statue of Thomas Coram by the sculptor William Calder Marshall, which had once stood at the entrance gates of the Bloomsbury Hospital grounds. Prior to the sale of the school to Hertfordshire County Council in 1955, there was some debate about the original Foundling Hospital fixtures that had been brought to Berkhamsted. While some items were left in place in Ashlyns, many other items were removed. The remains of Thomas Coram were exhumed and moved to the Church of St Andrew, Holborn in London. The chapel organ was also dismantled and re-installed in St Andrew's Holborn along with the font and pulpit. Since 2003, Ashlyns School building and its chapel have been a Grade II listed building.

It specializes in frozen custard and large \\"jumbo\\" hamburgers. Founded by Elsa Kopp in 1950, the restaurants continue to be heralded by local publications for their quality food. By 2017, they have locations in three Milwaukee suburbs. Kopp's was the first custard stand to offer a special \\"flavor of the day\\" in addition to the more traditional chocolate and vanilla flavors. History Founding Elsa Kopp opened the first Kopp's stand at 6005 W. Appleton Ave., Milwaukee, Wisconsin (now the site of JJ Fish & Chicken) in 1950. A German immigrant with no prior business experience, Kopp started the stand after her husband, Karl Kopp, developed Parkinson's disease. Some support in starting the business came from Leon Schneider, a custard machine repairman (the founder of Leon's Frozen Custard in 1942), whom Elsa Kopp had met while working at a bakery. The Kopp's frozen custard stand rose in popularity quickly during the 1950s and was soon seen as a Milwaukee staple. By 1960 the Kopp's stand was successful enough that Elsa felt comfortable experimenting with more exotic frozen custard recipes. Initially she mixed chocolate and vanilla, a controversial act in the early frozen custard community. After this, Kopp's began offering increasingly diverse concoctions which became their well known \\"flavor of the day\\" menu option. Kopp's offers two unique flavors every day and a featured shake and sundae of the month. The featured flavors are often related to events for that day or month. The Glendale location (5373 N. Port Washington Ave.) is on the site of the former Milky Way drive-in restaurant, the inspiration for the external look of the Happy Days diner, Arnold's Drive-In. Kopp's is now owned by Elsa's son, Karl Kopp, who also owns Elsa's on the Park on Jefferson St. in downtown Milwaukee which opened New Year's Eve of 1980. He has also opened restaurants in Arizona and New York. Each location prominently displays a portrait of Elsa Kopp. In September 2004, Vice President Dick Cheney made an unannounced visit to a Kopp's Frozen Custard location while campaigning for his and George W. Bush's reelection. Joe Biden visit In June 2010, Vice President Joe Biden visited a Kopp's Frozen Custard location while campaigning for Democratic Senator Russ Feingold. Biden asked the manager of Kopp's what he owed for his custard. In response, the manager stated \\"Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs on the house. Lower our taxes and we‚Äôll call it even.\\" In response, Biden came back later to the manager and said, \\"Why don‚Äôt you say something nice instead of being a smartass all the time?\\" The story was covered by both local and national news agencies.

The Chambord, which was a direct copy of the French built Simca Vedette, had first left the production line in March 1959 and featured an engine, 3 speed gearbox with the shifter located on the steering column and was assembled with parts imported from France. It was a large car, manufactured until 1969 in different versions (including the Alvorada) and styled by the Brazilian subsidiary of French automaker Simca at their factory in S√£o Bernardo do Campo, Brazil. Alvorada - a name with a vengeance The Simca Alvorada was a radically stripped down version based on the posh Simca Chambord as a result of a demand by the Brazilian government of president Juscelino Kubitcheck that every car manufacturer must offer an affordable basic version within their range. The idea was to give as many Brazilians as possible the possibility to own a car. While this was welcome news for Volkswagen, for example, Simca do Brasil was not exactly pleased with the idea as the brand had established itself comfortably in the luxury car sector in a way that Simca back in Europe never managed. However, despite having no plans to launch a cheap car and with no other options left, Simca do Brasil decided reluctantly to create an entry level version of their successful Simca Chambord. The Simca Alvorada appeared in 1963 with just two colours as option (grey and a faded yellow), no chrome, no trimmings and a very simple interior. As a silent protest the car was named after the place the order to create this model came from: The Pal√°cio da Alvorada, the presidential palace in the capital Brasilia.

He is the goalkeeping coach for Liverpool. Club career Achterberg first signed for Tranmere Rovers in 1998, after a successful trial as a replacement for the Everton bound Steve Simonsen. He was immediately selected for the first team due to an injury to Danny Coyne, making his debut against Swindon Town on 25 September 1998. Achterberg then secured his place as Rovers' first choice goalkeeper after Coyne was transferred to Grimsby Town in 1999. Achterberg became part of the giant-killing cup teams that defeated such opponents as Everton, Southampton and other big teams. However after refusing to sign a new contract he was dropped by John Aldridge for the 2000 Football League Cup Final and replaced by Joe Murphy. Achterberg's proficiency in goal was exemplified by the 20 clean sheets he kept during the 2003‚Äì04 season under the stewardship of Brian Little. One of his more memorable performances was against Millwall in an FA Cup quarter final at The New Den which was televised on BBC 1. The game finished goalless, but was largely dominated by Millwall and John managed to save a penalty kick from Kevin Muscat, despite having to play through injury. Achterberg's 2005‚Äì06 season was less successful. After spending most of the season sidelined with injuries, he was replaced by Steve Wilson and Dino Seremet, who was on loan from Luton Town. Achterberg's chances of re-establishing himself as Tranmere's first choice goalkeeper in 2006‚Äì07 were hampered by the signing and good form of veteran journeyman Gavin Ward. Later in the season, an injury to Ward gave Achterberg a chance, but a re- occurrence of his own injury problems saw him sit out the closing months of the season. Achterberg's contract expired in May 2007 and he was released by Tranmere on 25 May. This resulted in uproar from many Tranmere fans, who believed that Achterberg deserved a testimonial match, despite him falling just short of the ten years' service usually required to earn a testimonial at a club. On 31 May, however, he was given a two-year coaching and player contract with Tranmere. Achterberg made his 300th Rovers appearance in the opening day game of the 2008‚Äì09 season against Swindon Town. Achterberg had his testimonial game in 2009 for Tranmere against an Everton XI. Coaching career After retiring from playing/coaching in 2009 with Tranmere Rovers, Achterberg joined Liverpool FC in June 2009 as a goalkeeping coach of the reserve and academy goalkeepers before being promoted to first-team goalkeeping coach in summer 2011.

Both the Alliance and the Red- Greens pledged not to seek support from the SD, with Reinfeldt ruling out forming a government in cooperation with the Sweden Democrats. A privately owned television network, TV4, refused to air a SD campaign video, which was then uploaded to YouTube and viewed more than one million times. The SD video portrayed a track-meet, in which the race is for pension funds. In the video, a Swedish pensioner is outrun by burka-clad women with prams. Several politicians in Denmark, initially from the Danish People's Party and later from the governing Venstre and the Conservative People's Party, reacted to TV4's refusal to air the video by calling for international election observers to be sent to Sweden.Danish Politicians Call for Election Observers in Sweden Der Spiegel 1 September 2010 Pia Kj√¶rsgaard, leader of the Danish People's Party, claimed that the election reminded her of \\"Eastern Europe\\", and that Sweden was the \\"banana republic\\" of the Nordic countries. Per-Willy Amundsen of the Norwegian Progress Party also criticised the decision as a \\"violation of democratic rules.\\"  Violence  On 13 September in Gothenburg, about 500 counter-demonstrators prevented the Sweden Democrats from making a planned election rally. Police used pepper spray to disperse the counter- demonstration, which lacked a permit, and seven counter-demonstrators were detained. On 14 September, the Sweden Democrats cancelled planned rallies in three cities, Eskilstuna, Karlstad, and Uddevalla, because of security concerns. Similarly, concerns about security led to an election tour being cancelled on 15 September in Norrk√∂ping. After these cancelled election rallies, the National Police Commissioner Bengt Svenson severely criticized the county police for failing to safeguard the Sweden Democrats: \\"If it is not possible to protect them [in those locales], the police have failed in its planning and execution of its mission. [ . . . ] It is a serious problem when such meetings cannot be held, because it is our absolute duty to ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed rights be maintained and that all meetings can be held\\".  Consequences  These attempts to limit the SD message were described by Al Jazeera as counterproductive, in that they enabled the SD to portray itself as a victim of censorship. Similarly, Hanne Kj√∂ller of Dagens Nyheter hypothesised that the attacks strengthened the Sweden Democrats rather than hurting the party's support base. \\"Jimmie √Ökesson becomes a poor underdog and the picture of a party that is holding some dangerous but important truth is enhanced. The Sweden Democrats should send flowers to the left-wing extremists, thanking them for the publicity.\\"\\"Sverigedemokraterna: Blommogram till extremv√§nstern\\" Dagens Nyheter 18 September 2010  Reactions  As exit polls conducted by the national broadcaster Swedish Television predicted, the Sweden Democrats reached the 4% threshold needed to enter parliament, making this election the first in which they were able to enter parliament. A preliminary count of 5,668 voting districts showed the Alliance with 172 seats, ahead of the Red-Greens. However, this fell short of the 175 seats needed for an absolute majority, and it appeared the Sweden Democrats would hold the balance of power in the new parliament. Reinfeldt declared that he had no intention to cooperate with the Sweden Democrats. On 23 September, the final results showed the Centre Party gaining an adjustment seat in Dalarna, giving the Alliance a total seat count of 173, still two seats short of an absolute majority. The Alliance's Liberal People's Party were only 7 and 19 votes short from gaining additional seats in Gothenburg and V√§rmland respectively, but according to Svante Linusson, a professor in mathematics, the actual margin was still over 800 votes.Superrysare, Aftonbladet On the day after the election, rallies against the Sweden Democrats took place in a number of Swedish cities. Reports indicated that 10,000 people were estimated to have marched in Stockholm under banners reading \\"We are ashamed\\", \\"No racists in Parliament\\",\\"Mass demonstration: We are ashamed\\" , Sveriges Radio. and \\"Refugees - welcome!\\". In Gothenburg, 5,000 people took part in a \\"sorrow march against racism\\", and 2,000 people marched in Malm√∂. Support for the Sweden Democrats was strongest in the southernmost province Scania, where the party received about 10% percent of the vote, and in the neighbouring province Blekinge, where they received 9.8 percent; the foreign media quoted \\"some people\\" from further north of the country as calling for Scania to be handed back to Denmark, where the Danish People's Party were seen as an inspiration for the SD. Liberal evening tabloid Expressen wrote in an editorial \\"The banner of tolerance has been hauled down and the forces of darkness have finally also taken the Swedish democracy as hostage. It's a day of sorrow.\\" Liberal conservative morning newspaper Svenska Dagbladet said \\"[It is] time for the Swedes to get themselves a new national self-image [as the election] created a new picture of Sweden\\".  Analysis  > \\"While it‚Äôs hard to say that Sweden has woken up to a new self-image, one > can say that this is more like a normal European situation and is similar to > other western European countries with a proportional election system, where > a populist right-wing party has seats in parliament. It‚Äôs the party that is > the least liked among other voters, so it is not surprising that people have > reacted with dismay\\". Carl Dahlstroem, professor of politics at Gothenburg > University. The election was a landmark for its impact on the Social Democrats, which had been in government for 65 of the last 78 years and who had never lost two consecutive elections. This was their worst result since universal suffrage in 1921. Swedish political scientist Stig-Bj√∂rn Ljunggren said \\"The Social Democrats no longer symbolise the Swedish model. They've lost their magic.\\" The Dagens Nyheter postulated that electoral failure was based on internal factors, such that the Social Democrats failed to win over the middle class and had completely lost touch with their original vision, which had made them a dominant political party. The Irish Times saw the rise of the SD as sending \\"ripples of shock not only through the country but through European politics,\\" and asked \\"Is this finally it for the 'Swedish model'\\" that has been represented as a \\"meld of liberal values, high taxes, outstanding childcare and welfare that made the country the poster boy for European social democracy?\\" The Social Democrats' failure reflected the party's inability to adapt, an increasingly technocratic profile, a failure to address immigration concerns, as well as Reinfeldt's success in managing the economy. The results draws parallels with a larger decline of European left parties. An article in Al Jazeera English asked if Western political dynamics were changing following the Swedish and United States elections. The article said that predictions after the election indicated \\"an entirely new political landscape\\" and \\"the beginning of an era of sharper political division in Sweden.\\" It asked if the similar results \\"reflect rather an underlying continuity in the generation- long evolution of Euro-American politics towards a fully neoliberalised system\\" and that Sweden seemed to be \\"moving towards an outdated model.\\" It also said that, while social policies were similarly moving to the right, economic policies were poles apart, with the emergence of far-right parties in Sweden and Denmark still supporting the welfare state and the American parties remaining on the economic right-wing. The case of Annika Holmqvist, a seriously ill 55-year-old woman who had her sickness benefits withdrawn and was requested to seek work, allegedly due to the Alliance's reforms of Sweden's social security system, gave the opposition a late boost in its campaign. The Local thinks it might have deprived the Alliance of an overall majority. Holmqvist's daughter wrote about her case in a web log post that gained publicity and became a hot topic in the debates. In spite of promises of a solution, after the election it was decided Holmqvist will lose her illness benefits.Reinfeldt rocked by 'chlamydia letter', The Local, 19 September 2010'Chlamydia letter' blogger deprived of benefits, The Local, 21 September 2010. The Moderate Party was still seen as one of the big winners of the election because of its \\"well-executed campaign\\" that emphasised Sweden's \\"remarkable political and economic stability in a turbulent world\\" after Sweden weathered the recession; despite mass unemployment, the economic growth in 2010 was the highest in Western Europe.  Government formation The Alliance formed the new government with Reinfeldt continuing as prime minister. His cabinet has 24 ministers, three more than the previous one. The Moderates received 13 posts, an increase of three from their previous count, with the Liberals (4), Centre (4) and Christian Democrats (3) not gaining or losing ministers. Jan Bj√∂rklund, the leader of the Liberal Party, was promoted to Deputy Prime Minister replacing Maud Olofsson. Carl Bildt remained Foreign Minister and Anders Borg remained Minister for Finance. The new ministers are Stefan Attefall, the Minister for Public Administration and Housing at the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs; Ulf Kristersson, replacing Cristina Husmark Pehrsson as Minister for Social Security; Erik Ullenhag, the Minister for Integration at the Ministry of Employment; Hillevi Engstr√∂m, the Minister for Employment; Anna-Karin Hatt, the Minister for Information Technology and Regional Affairs at the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications; Peter Norman, replacing Mats Odell as Minister for Financial Markets; and Catharina Elms√§ter-Sv√§rd, replacing √Ösa Torstensson as Minister for Communications. Tobias Krantz, former Minister of Higher Education at the Ministry of Education and Research, is leaving with no successor having been named. Reinfeldt issued a 30-page statement of the new government's policies, saying it would \\"seek a broad-based and responsible solutions (sic)\\", and that it would \\"be natural...to hold regular discussions with the Green Party, in the first instance and also the Social Democratic Party where appropriate.\\"  References   External links  * Val 2010 from the main website, english version * NSD: European Election Database - Sweden publishes regional level election data; allows for comparisons of election results, 1992‚Äì2010 2010 Category:2010 elections in Sweden Category:September 2010 events in Europe da:Riksdagen#Riksdagsvalget 2010 ","title":"2010 Swedish general election"},{"id":"7183644","text":"Ultras are organised football supporter groups.

Edwards Model 20 railcar History Harry P. Edwards began building passenger railway equipment in 1917 and formed the Edwards Railway Motor Car Company in 1921. Edwards turned out over 130 cars over a two-decade span and made a name for itself among major South and Central American railways, as well as on U.S. Class 1 and short line railroads. Formative years In 1915 the Atlantic and Western Railway, a short line running from Sanford to Lillington, N.C., was running an uneconomical steam passenger train which A&W; General Manager Harry P. Edwards came to regard with mounting frustration. Searching for a way to stem the flow of red ink, Edwards built his first car for use on that railroad. Other cars were built in the shops of the A&W; and marketed by Edwards and the Atlantic & Western Railway. As the word spread throughout the South about the economical rail cars built by Edwards, the demand for cars was such that in 1921 the manufacturing firm Edwards Railway Motor Car Co. was organized and in 1922 occupied its new plant along the tracks of the A&W.; The short line was not only an Edwards customer, but its tracks served as a test, demonstration and development track for over twenty years of Edwards car production. 1920‚Äì1942 During the early 1920s, mainstays of this output was the Model-10 which had the engine mounted up in the baggage compartment, as was the fashion of most all other manufacturers. In 1926 the company started delivery of the new Model-20. What set the Model-20 apart from the Model-10 and competitor's models was the ingenious, patented, power truck design, with the motor set into the front truck frame instead of being up in the car body. Edwards output during the 1930s was mainly export cars including the \\"modern\\" streamlined Model-21 and the streamlined version of the Model-10, with their distinctive shovel-nose, first developed by Edwards in 1935. By the late 1930s sales of railcars in the United States was at an all-time low, and with the war in Europe, Edwards sold the plant and new owners re-tooled for defense production in 1940. In 1942 the Edwards Company lost its corporate identity and ceased to exist, rail motor cars and trailers were the only Edwards products manufactured under that name. As of 1933 the company claimed rail car sales to forty-four railroads; final tally of original purchasers was close to fifty. With sales, in a 22-year period to nineteen different countries in the Western Hemisphere. Only a handful of Edwards cars have survived today.

The system was first installed in a test fleet of 1,000 1973 Chevrolet Impala 4-door sedans, painted in a unique green color. The exterior of these Impalas were identical to regular 1973 production models, but used a 1974-style Oldsmobile instrument panel and brand-new steering wheel design. The chassis of these cars were reinforced, and each Impala was equipped with a high-performance 350 cubic- inch V8 engine, the same one used in the Corvette. Of the original fleet of Chevrolets, virtually all were eventually disposed of except one, which is currently fully restored. The only reported fatality was an unrestrained infant killed in a crash when the passenger's side airbag deployed in one of the Impalas. Interestingly, in the early 1990s, two of the original test Impalas were located, one in a junkyard, the other, stored in a shed. Although in rundown condition, both cars were able to refurbished enough to be crash- tested, and the airbags deployed perfectly in both vehicles. https://www.autonews.com/article/20111031/CHEVY100/310319928/impalas-1973-experimental- airbags-held-up Due to success of the test fleet, GM decided to offer the ACRS as an option for full-size Cadillacs, Oldsmobiles, and Buicks for the 1974 model year. Only 10,000 ACRS units were installed for the life of the option, and buyers of these as used cars often were not even aware that they had the airbags, unless they deployed in a collision. GM advertised the system and it worked well, saving lives. ACRS-optioned cars were exempt from the 1974 Federal seat-belt standard that required belts to be fastened before the engine would start. Lap belts were provided for front seat passengers. Front shoulder belts were considered unnecessary, and were not provided. However, GM felt not enough were purchased to justify the cost of producing it, so the option was withdrawn after the 1976 model year. The ACRS system was coded as Regular Production Option AR3. GM did not introduce air bags on their automobiles again until the 1988 model year as a $350.00 option on the Oldsmobile Delta 88.

The technology was pioneered by Geoff Wilde at Rolls-Royce in the 1970s http://civil.rolls-royce.com/wide-chord-jet-engine-fan-blades/ and development from a variety of manufacturers continues today. Overview The main fan on a jet engine consists of a number of aerofoils mounted at the rotational center on the fan disk, and as the engine core rotates the fan blades accelerate an air mass and create the force to move forward which gives thrust (in accordance with Newton's Third Law). In theory the larger the fan diameter (the line from the tip of one fanblade to its opposite member) the greater the thrust. In practical applications, fan size is limited by the weight, the space available around the aircraft and by the increased drag (resistance) generated by the larger frontal area. In the race to achieve better fuel economy, more thrust and less weight & noise from jet engines, designers have refined the blade design and materials to extract more thrust for any given fan disk area. One significant improvementhttp://civil.rolls- royce.com/wide-chord-jet-engine-fan-blades Rolls Royce Plc, 2004 is to make blade chords wider and, more recently, alter the blade geometry to give it a scimitar-like shape. Further refinements include making the blades from a light material such as titanium and to manufacture them with a hollow cross- section. Modern jet engines such as the Rolls Royce Trent 900 and the Engine Alliance GP7000, which both power the Airbus A380, are examples of wide-chord fan engines. Key design considerations The geometry of a jet engine blade is essentially that of an airfoil and as such, there is no single optimum design. As with most mechanical components, the blade is a compromise in trying to achieve as large a blade area as possible within the practical constraints: Widening the blade chord will increase the blade drag while lengthening the blade will increase tip speed (and noise) plus it may make the fandisc impractically large. A larger blade is also heavier, which when taken together with increasing tip speed as the fandisc gets larger, puts a point of diminishing return between weight and blade length (tip speed.)http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/propulsion/q0039.shtml Aerospaceweb.org; Jeff Scott, 12 August 2001 A wide chord engine addresses this by having fewer, wider, blades meaning a wide chord fan engine will have fewer, but more effective, fanblades compared to a regular jet engine. To address the weight issue, blades are often hollow and made from titanium. Finally, blades are often given a scimitar shape to achieve higher flying speeds. The Wide-Chord Swept fan blade was designed and developed at Rolls- Royce Barnoldswick in Lancashire, and is still manufactured there to this day. The process uses Superplastically formed, diffusion bonded technology to achieve the light weight, strong design. http://www.geae.com/education/vocabulary.html GE Aviation: Engine Education, 2008 References *AerospaceWeb-Propeller Design * Types of Turbines, University of Bath, UK External links * Rolls-Royce fans * The Rolls Royce Trent 900 wide chord jet engine Category:Jet engines ","title":"Wide chord"},{"id":"7183794","text":"Andrew James Tierney (born 20 June 1974) is an Australian singer-songwriter and musician, who is a member of the music group Human Nature.Bee Gees add to Human Nature album He is the brother of fellow band member Michael Tierney, and he and his wife live in Las Vegas.http://www.humannaturelive.com/what-a- year-2016-has-been-for-human- nature/https://www.reviewjournal.com/entertainment/entertainment- columns/robin-leach/andrew-tierney-of-human-nature-7-is-my-lucky-number-in- las-vegas// References Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian singer-songwriters Category:Human Nature (band) members Category:Singers from Sydney Category:21st-century Australian singers Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:21st- century male singers Category:Australian male singer-songwriters ","title":"Andrew Tierney"},{"id":"7183795","text":"Charles Edward Crawford, known as ed fROMOHIO, (born January 26, 1964, in Steubenville, Ohio) is an American best known as the lead singer and guitarist for Firehose, an alternative rock band he formed in 1986 with former Minutemen members Mike Watt (bass guitar) and George Hurley (drums). Biography In 1985, Minutemen vocalist and guitarist D. Boon was killed in a van wreck. In 1986, Ed, a recent Ohio State University graduate and Minutemen fan, heard an erroneous rumor that Watt and Hurley were auditioning new guitarists from a member of Camper Van Beethoven. Ed contacted Watt after obtaining his phone number and talked his way into visiting San Pedro. Watt and Hurley were still very much grief-stricken over the death of their friend and bandmate but Crawford traveled all the way from Ohio to San Pedro, California to meet Watt. Crawford was about to return to Ohio, when at the last minute, Watt accepted Ed's offer. Along with Hurley, they formed Firehose. Shortly thereafter, the new band would record their first album, Ragin', Full On, and started touring. Eventually, he would record four more LPs with the band. Ed sang and played guitar with Firehose until they broke up in 1994 after releasing five albums and touring extensively. Ed currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and recently started playing solo acoustic as well as electric gigs around town with his new band, the Ed Crawford Trio. He appeared in the 2005 documentary film We Jam Econo. Since Firehose's break-up, he has also fronted the band Grand National (not to be confused with the UK band also named Grand National), and toured as a second guitarist with the now-defunct alt-country band Whiskeytown led by Ryan Adams, as well as with the Chapel Hill band Southern Culture on the Skids, and the Detroit band Mule. As of 2012, Ed is playing in a band called \\"Food\\" which is an acronym for \\"Far Out Old Dudes\\". As of July 2020, Ed has lost his job and is living in his car. A go fund me page was put together by fans of Ed and firehose, seeking to raise $8000 to help him get a place to live in the Pittsburgh area.

Leo was portrayed by Josh Duhamel, and Greenlee was portrayed by Rebecca Budig. The couple is often referred to by the portmanteau \\"Greenleo\\" (for Greenlee and Leo) on Internet message boards. The pairing accumulated significant acclaim and media attention during their reign, 1999 to 2002, including two nominations at the Daytime Emmy Awards for America's Favorite Couple. Their loving but antagonistic relationship is regarded as one of the greatest romances in American daytime television. Storyline Schemers Leo du Pres and Greenlee Smythe meet when Greenlee is trying to win back college flame Scott Chandler from virgin do-gooder Becca Tyree. Leo wants Becca for himself, so when Greenlee offers him a bet to get Becca into bed, Leo readily takes the challenge. Leo and Greenlee's friendship deepens and as time passes, they learn they have a lot in common. Greenlee eventually moves on to attempting to seduce Ryan Lavery, but gives him up when it becomes obvious that he only loves Gillian Andrassy. Greenlee develops a relationship with Leo. The two fool around, but neither think about becoming a serious couple. Greenlee's trouble with a criminal named Wade turns dangerous. Wade somehow manages to escape jail and goes after Greenlee for turning him in to the cops. He holds Greenlee at gunpoint and demands that she get him a sizable chunk of cash and a passport out of the country. Greenlee tries her best to get Leo out of the way by telling him that she does not care about him and wants nothing more to do with him. Nevertheless, Leo continues hanging around and almost gets shot in the process. Wade later corners Greenlee and holds her hostage for $1,000,000 in ransom. Woodruff agrees to drop off the money at the boathouse (a placed where Pine Valley residents go for peace) in order to win his granddaughter's freedom. Leo happens upon the scene and tries to muscle Wade into submission. He fails and Wade locks Leo and Greenlee in a faulty elevator. Leo helps Greenlee escape the elevator before its cable snaps; Leo is not as lucky, though he does manage to escape before the elevator totally bottoms out. Afterward, Leo and Greenlee are closer than ever. Leo takes Greenlee to the tropics to toast to their new relationship. Greenlee is unaware that Leo is using her grandfather's ransom money to fund the getaway. When Greenlee learns the truth, she and Leo return to Pine Valley and Leo is subsequently arrested for theft. Greenlee asks her grandfather to have the charges against Leo dropped. Woodruff says that he will only talk to Leo. Woodruff visits Leo in his jail cell and tells him that he will drop the charges against him if he agrees to take the rest of the ransom money and fly to Europe -- and never see Greenlee again. Leo refuses and wins Woodruff's respect in the process. Greenlee, however, thinks that Leo has accepted the offer and severs her ties to Leo. She later learns from her grandfather that Leo has not accepted the offer, but by then Leo is furious with Greenlee and is questioning whether or not he really wants her in his life. Leo and Greenlee find themselves growing more and more fond of each other. Eventually, Leo and Greenlee's attraction turns to love. In the later winter of 2001, Greenlee asks Leo to marry her. Leo fears accepting her proposal because Roger Smythe, Greenlee's father, learned why he originally came to Pine Valley -- to swindle Greenlee out of her fortune. As it turns out, Leo developed true feelings for Greenlee and no longer wants her money. He has a prenuptial agreement drawn up that will prevent him from seeing even one cent of Greenlee's money after a split. Roger catches wind of the agreement and flies in a woman from Verona, Italy named Katerina di Courcey. During his days as a con, Leo had taken Katerina for everything she had. Katerina lies and says that Leo asked her for a prenup too. She makes up the story to ruin Leo's happiness, the same way that he ruined hers when he stole her money. Greenlee and Leo promptly split, though it is clear that they both love each other. In spring, a frantic Brooke English begs Leo to pretend to be interested in her dying daughter, Laura, so that this will spur Laura to fight for her life. Leo initially refuses, but over time he and Laura grow closer. It is suspect if Leo truly loves Laura, but also clear that he does care for her and wants to see her recover fully. On June 18, Leo pops the question to a hospitalized Laura and she accepts. Just two days later, the pair marry in Laura's hospital room with Brooke, Bianca Montgomery, David Hayward (Leo's half-brother), and nurse Zora in attendance. However, in spite of her happiness, Laura's health continues to deteriorate rapidly and the only possible way to save her life is with a heart transplant. In the nick of time, Leo learns that Gillian has been shot in the head and manages to convince her grieving husband, Ryan, to donate her heart to Laura. Laura rapidly recovers, but is quite needy and Leo almost immediately realizes that as much as he wants to, he does not love her. Leo is in love with Greenlee, and cannot even fathom making love to his wife. Even though he is married to Laura, Greenlee is determined to win back Leo. When Laura recovers from her transplant, Leo finds himself trapped in a loveless marriage. Greenlee seizes her opportunity and is tossed in jail after violating a restraining order to steer clear of the married couple. Greenlee eventually gives up on Leo, as he is determined to keep Laura happy in his sham of a marriage. Greenlee subsequently moves in with Jake Martin and the two become very close. Laura eventually begins to go insane, plotting against Greenlee and ultimately guilts Leo into a \\"proper\\" ceremony, where Leo comes to his senses and turns Laura down. As he gives her back his ring, Greenlee, who was trapped by Laura in an air duct, sets off the sprinkler system in an attempt to get help. The entire wedding party ducks for cover except for Leo, who feels cleansed of Laura and is ready to win Greenlee back. Once Leo leaves Laura, Greenlee becomes torn between Jake and Leo. Neither man wants to be \\"the other man.\\" Leo proposes to Greenlee and she accepts, but the engagement is later broken when Leo tries to give her the ring in front of Jake and Laura, which Greenlee takes as an attempt to show up Jake. The two quickly get back together however, but the happiness is short-lived. Greenlee ends up trapped on an island with Jake after she is drugged and left for dead on a sinking boat by Leo's mother, Vanessa Cortlandt, who sets it up to make Leo think Greenlee has left him for Jake. Greenlee and an also-drugged Jake escaped their near-watery grave, but Greenlee's unwillingness to commit to Jake results in Jake walking away and Leo and Greenlee happily reunite. Leo spends most of 2002 coping with his bizarre and criminal family. First comes Vanessa kidnapping and nearly killing Greenlee, and the reveal that Vanessa has long been Proteus, head of an international drug cartel. Leo begins to wonder about the drug money she has stashed away somewhere, seeing the cash as a way for he and Greenlee to eventually move to their favorite city, Paris. Vanessa develops a split personality, is admitted to the hospital as a psych patient, and Leo is drawn into her needs in spite of his better judgment. He also distrusts her new lawyer, Trey Kenyon, and with good reason, as Trey is plotting against him and Vanessa, both out of revenge and to get his hands on the Proteus money. Unknown to everyone, Trey is Leo's long-lost half-brother, and wants revenge for what he feels was abandonment by his family. As Greenlee tries to deal with Leo's need to stay in Vanessa's life and the constant revolving door of his new-found relatives (cousins Frankie and Maggie Stone), she and Leo finally manage to marry in the summer. Even this is marred, due to former associates of Vanessa's (who also want the drug money) crashing the wedding with her in tow. Greenlee's father, Roger Smythe, who continues to worm his way back into her life, even after disappointing her countless times, is shot by drug operatives. A few hours before he dies, he accidentally lets it slip to Greenlee that he was sleeping with her bridesmaid and close friend, Simone Torres. After he dies, Greenlee's pain is intensified when she overhears her grandfather telling her mother, Mary Smythe, who has come back into her life claiming to want a reconciliation, that he knows she is only interested in Greenlee because she wants to be put back into his will. Greenlee's dependency on Leo magnifies and they go off on a brief honeymoon. Their happiness is not to last. When they return to town, the couple becomes embroiled with Trey and Kendall Hart, both of whom Greenlee despises, in a quest to track down the missing Proteus drug money. The paper trail ends in worthless stocks, and with Vanessa being shipped off to a federal location, Greenlee seizes the opportunity to convince Leo to move to Paris with her. However, Vanessa goes into a coma, \\"dies\\" for a few seconds, and comes back to life as the calm, sweet mother Leo never had, calling herself Nessa. Leo feels close to her for the first time. He discovers that he has another long-lost relative -- Trey is actually his older brother, Ben Shepherd. Trey assumed his dead best friend's identity and dedicated his life to wreaking havoc on the mother who had abandoned him at birth. Leo, also a lost soul, quickly accepts Trey and forgives the many misdeeds Trey had perpetrated on him in the past months. Working with Greenlee and Kendall, they find the Proteus \\"stash\\", which are worthless stocks. They think that the trail has finally reached a dead end, and can only laugh. Even though Vanessa has supposedly given way to a kinder, gentler split personality, Greenlee does not trust her for a second. In truth, \\"Nessa\\", who is now in federal custody, has reverted to being Vanessa, and knows that the real treasure happens to be a fortune in diamonds. Greenlee is increasingly frightened by Nessa and never believes for a second that she is kind or sweet. She demands that Leo finally give up his \\"loser\\" family for good, and he agrees. But moments before their flight to Paris, he receives a call from David, whom he had been helping out after his latest arrest and imprisonment. Unfortunately, while he was absent, Vanessa kidnapped Greenlee. She took her to waterfall Miller's Falls. Vanessa informs Leo that he has to find and give her the diamonds before she will release Greenlee. In a panic, Leo finds the jewels and races to the falls with Trey. When Vanessa refuses to release her, Leo begins dropping the priceless gems over the falls, one by one. Vanessa agrees to do as he wishes, but actually plans to kill her hated enemy. When Vanessa threatens to shoot Leo if he does not give up the diamonds, Greenlee fights with Vanessa for the gun but is knocked off the edge, falling onto a ledge 20 feet below. Leo thinks Greenlee is dead and attacks Vanessa, but Greenlee's call gives him hope and he starts to climb down to her. When Vanessa realizes Greenlee survived the fall, she begins shooting at her. Leo rushes at Vanessa and wrestles with her for the gun, but their combined weight pushes mother and son over the falls. His body is never recovered. His beloved \\"Greens\\" and his family, who saw him as their moral center, are devastated. As much as they try to move on with their lives, they feel an inescapable ache. Greenlee lost her soul mate and one true love. Pine Valley and Greenlee would never quite be the same without him. On August 4, 2011, Leo and Greenlee briefly reunited for the first time in 9 years. On August 5, they share a kiss which causes Greenlee to wake to find that in Leo's place is Zach. Greenlee was brought back by The Orpheus Project. Impact Leo and Greenlee were acclaimed among All My Children viewers and soap opera television critics, and were dubbed \\"GreenLeo.\\" In 2000, the pairing were named \\"Best New Couple\\" by magazine Soap Opera Digest, and in 2001, as well as 2002, were nominated for the Daytime Emmy fan award America's Favorite Couple. The couple were a top contender in NBC's 2002 Soap Chat Viewers Choice Awards Cyber-Ceremony, and in 2003, the duo's part in a young Bianca Montgomery \\"coming out\\" as gay was documented in C. Lee Harrington's book Homosexuality on All My Children: transforming the daytime landscape. In 2000, Soap Opera Digest stated: In 2007, Soaps In Depth listed the pairing among the ten perfect couples for the magazine's tenth anniversary issue. Originally, the couple were considered as being \\"on the verge of\\" supercouple status, but in February 2009, soap opera columnist Carolyn Aspenson stated that Leo and Greenlee were a \\"supercouple redefined\\". She argued that tragic couples such as Leo and Greenlee are a better love story than if they had stayed together with a \\"boring\\" everyday life. \\"They loved, they lost. Their love ‚Äòended‚Äô tragically but the love itself didn‚Äôt die. The death of Leo saddened and frustrated the fans but left them with the thought that these two were meant to be together,\\" she said. In 2011, with the return of Josh Duhamel as Leo, the pairing were also referred to as a supercouple by Entertainment Weekly's Lynette Rice.

Its function is to connect the upper River Lea to the canalised section that runs through Hertfordshire, North London into the River Thames. The section of the river above Castle Weir is not deep enough to support barges or narrow boats, but is navigable by row boats, canoes and kayaks. The weir marks the start of the River Lee Navigation. It is overlooked by a function room at the Hertford Theater (previously called Castle Hall). Access Just off Mill Bridge (B158 road) in the centre of Hertford town, beside the Castle Hall. A small bridge runs from Mill Bridge over the secondary drop to a car park. A step upstream from this bridge allows access to the top of the weir. Angling Angling in the weir pool is possible, but tricky due to pontoon access at the weir pool. Anglers often stand on the stepped weir drops, but this is discouraged due to the damage that is sustained to the weir itself. Weir setup Castle Weir has 3 sections: * A vertical 70 cm drop onto a second 30 cm concrete block, situated in a stilling pool. The stilling pool overflows into a tunnel which leads under the road. The 70 cm drop has two electric gates which move vertically in high flows. * 5 padlocked sluice gates. Rarely used, as these are manually controlled by British Waterways. * Stepped drop for high flows. Whitewater use Kayakers and canoeists regularly use the weir for practicing whitewater skills and playboating. * Main drop - Can be run straight or sideways. * Main drop sluice - Creates a jet which can tail squirts can be performed on. At high flows it makes the weir harder to paddle in, and can cause pinning in the stopper, river right. * Stilling pool drop - Side-surfing is possible at most flows. Cartwheeling is possible when the pool level raises. Normally about 70 cm deep. * Side sluice - A wave and stopper forms here, depending on weir pool levels and amount of water coming through the sluice. This water has been constricted by kayakers using concrete blocks to form different features. It can vary from 30‚Äì50 cm high wave which can be carved in front-surf, to a shallow retentive pour-over, which is side-surf able. * Stepped drop - Can be run when river is in spate, very likely to do damage to the weir or your boat when the water flowing over it is less than 3 cm in depth. A small wave and stopper forms at the bottom which can be played on, however, it is very shallow.

It was the total headquarters of Japan Karate Federation (old). Characteristics of Shudokan karate include large circular motions with an emphasis on covering and its own unique kata. History Toyama's karate training began at the age of nine in 1897 with Itarashiki, although he studied with Yatsusune Itosu for 18 years, until the latter's death in 1915. In 1907 Toyama was appointed \\"shihandai\\" (assistant master) to Itosu at the Okinawa Teacher's College, and he and Gichin Funakoshi, who later developed Shotokan karate, were the only two students to be granted the title of shihanshi (prot√©g√©). Some people believe that Kanken Toyama outranked Gichin Funakoshi, who did not have the rank of shihandai. In 1924 Toyama moved his family to Taiwan, where he taught in an elementary school and studied Chinese Ch'uan Fa, which included Taku, Makaitan, Rutaobai, and Ubo from teachers Chen Fo-Chai (Èô≥‰ΩõÊøü) and Lin Hsien- Tang (ÊûóÁåÆÂ†Ç). In early 1930 he returned to Japan and on March 20, 1930, he opened his first dojo in Tokyo. He named his dojo Shu Do Kan meaning \\"the hall for the study of the karate way.\\" Toyama taught what he had learnt from Itosu and the Ch'uan Fa and did not claim to have originated a new style of karate. In 1946, Toyama founded the All Japan Karate-Do Federation (AJKF) with the intention of unifying the various forms of karate of Japan and Okinawa under one governing organization. When GHQ announced the martial arts ban in 1945, disciples of Sh≈´d≈çkan a dojo studio called Kanbukan (ÈüìÊ≠¶Ëàò), founded by the Korean Dr. Yoon Kwei Byung (guest teacher: Yun Moo Kwan & founder: Jidokwan in 1953 in South Korea), for the purpose of escaping from a martial arts ban. Kanbukan was the meaning called the martial arts of Korea, and disciples kept Karate of Kanken Toyama by camouflage from GHQ. Kanbukan changes renbukan and the name later and forms JKF. Shudokan becomes the headquarters of Japan Karate Federation (old) then. JKF(old) is current JKF Renbukai. As Toyama did not view the Shu Do Kan as a distinct style of karate, but merely a place for training, he did not appoint a successor. Thus, the organization he founded fragmented after his death in 1966, although his student Toshi Hanaue maintained the original Shu Do Kan. A few other schools based on Toyama's teachings still exist such as Doshinkan. Today, a minimal overseeing of the Toyama lineage of Karate is done by Kanken Toyama's son, Ha Toyama. Shudokan Today Shudokan karate today is essentially a compound system, including Kobudo (i.e. \\"ancient art,\\" referring to the specialized weapons practice of traditional Okinawan karate) and Shorin-Ryu (also known as Itosu-ha). Many other principles from other styles have found their way into Shudokan as it was Toyama's wish that Shudokan not stagnate, that it should grow in efficiency and flourish. United States Many current practitioners of Shudokan Karate would concur that Toyama's wish for Shudokan is still being upheld. In the United States the art of Shudokan Karate is being taught, however different in some ways, by the American Shudokan Association (ASA) formerly under the leadership of Morris Mack of Yakima, Washington. The ASA, with over 15,000 members in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, was founded by Walter Todd and Morris Mack in the 1980s. Walter Todd was a student under Yoko Takahashi who was a direct student of Kanken Toyama. Later, Kanken Toyama appointed Walter Todd as Shibu-cho (Branch Director) for the U.S., authorizing him to rank students in Shudokan (Toyama-Style) karate and direct the development of Shudokan in America. After Toyama's passing, his son, Ha Toyama, approved Todd's rank of eighth rank. Walter Todd died at the age of 72 on November 26, 1999. Morris Mack died at the age of 78 on August 14, 2017. Influence on Tang Soo Do and Taekwondo via Korean students Of the nine schools, or Kwan's (Kan) that merged to form Taekwondo, four of those schools have lineages that trace back to Toyama Sensei through three Korean men who trained in Japan while Korea was under Japanese occupation. These three men were Kim Ki Whang, Dr. Yoon Kwey Byung and Yoon Byung In. Dr. Yoon and Yoon both trained with Toyama Sensei and are both listed in his student role books as \\"Shihan.\\" Both these men taught a mixture of Toyama Sensei's methods along with the Chuan Fa they learned in Manchuria, before the Taekwondo unification movement. At that time, they founded Tang Soo Do or Kong Soo Do schools in Korea. The first Kwan (Kan) where they worked as teachers was the Yunmookwan (later: Jidokwan). Kim Ki Whang received his 3rd dan from Toyama Sensei and had moved to the United States in the early 1960s to teach Taekwondo. Later, the Chang Moo Kwan, Han Moo Kwan and Kang Duk Won branched off from the first Kwan. This is according to Han Moo Kwan founder Kyo Yoon Lee as written in his book Global Taekwondo 2009, and, A Modern History of Taekwondo, by Won Sik Kang and Kyong Myung Lee (1999).

Naturally in 2010 the theme of the decorations was railways. Great Malvern railway station is one of two stations serving the town of Malvern, Worcestershire, England (the other being Malvern Link station) on the Hereford to Worcester section of the Cotswold Line. It is situated downhill from the centre of Great Malvern and close to Barnards Green. The station retains most of its original Victorian station design by the architect Edmund Wallace Elmslie and is a Grade II listed building. History Great Malvern station was opened by the Worcester and Hereford Railway in 1860 and the present buildings, by architect Edmund Wallace Elmslie, were completed in 1862. The Midland Railway and the London and North Western Railway collaborated on the construction cost; the solicitor, Samuel Carter, was also solicitor to both of these major companies. It was later absorbed by the Great Western Railway. Lady Emily Foley was a key sponsor of the building of Great Malvern station. She had a waiting room made for her exclusive use at Great Malvern Station, which is now ‚ÄòLady Foley's Tea Room‚Äô. The station celebrated its 150th birthday on 23 May 2010 with the unveiling of a plaque and a special train.Malvern Worcester 150th Anniversary Official website\\"Worcestershire railway stations mark 150 years\\" 23 May 2010 Retrieved 23 May 2010 An additional part of this celebration was the reinstatement of some of the highly decorated lighting columns around the cab road at the front of the station. Architecture The buildings are in local Malvern Rag stone and follow a French Gothic theme. Floral capitals to canopy columns Floral capital to a canopy column A particular feature of the station are the deep canopies which are supported by elaborate, cast-iron girders, which are in turn supported by columns with elaborate capitals. These capitals are decorated with high relief mouldings depicting different arrangements of flowers and foliage.The Railway Station Gallery The sculptor William Forsyth was employed to work on the buildings and designed the metal capitals of the columns which support the canopies above both platforms of the station. The Worm access to Imperial Hotel Interior view of the Worm At the end of Platform 2 is the entrance to the Worm, an enclosed passageway which leads under Avenue Road into the former Imperial Hotel (now Malvern St James). It formed a private pedestrian access and is believed to be the only structure of its kind in the country. Although in need of extensive restoration and generally not open to the public, the Worm is itself Grade II listed. Services The station is served by two train operating companies: West Midlands Trains (who manage the station) and Great Western Railway. West Midlands Trains operate services to Birmingham New Street via Worcester and every hour and also some services to Whitlocks End and Dorridge via the Snow Hill Lines. A handful of West Midlands Trains services start or terminate here each day, to/from Worcester & Birmingham.GB National Rail Timetable 2015-16, Table 71 (Network Rail) Great Western Railway operate a roughly hourly service to London Paddington via the Cotswold Line and Oxford (some of which run to/from Hereford) and every two hours (except Sundays) to via .

Originally constructed in 1865, the lighthouse structure was later replaced in 1908 by a new structure, and finally in 1946 by an automated beacon on the United States Coast Guard air station on the end of Ediz Hook. History Ediz Hook is a three-mile-long sand spit that juts north and east into the Strait of Juan de Fuca and forms the natural harbor at Port Angeles. Private operators built navigational warning fires on the spit as early as 1861. The first Ediz Hook lighthouse was built near the tip of the spit in 1865. It was a two-story, schoolhouse-type building with a lighthouse tower arising at one end of its gabled roof. Its first keeper was George Smith, the father of Port Angeles's prime promoter, Victor Smith. In 1908, a second Ediz Hook lighthouse was constructed near the first lighthouse, with the two buildings existing in close proximity to each other. The new lighthouse used the same Carl W. Leick design employed at Oregon's Cape Arago Light. After taking over the spit for the Coast Guard Air Station Port Angeles, the Coast Guard deactivated the lighthouse in 1946 and replaced it with a skeletal communications tower. The site's original lighthouse was demolished in 1939. The light tower of the 1908 keeper's house was removed when the structure was relocated to Fourth and Albert streets in Port Angeles where it has been a private residence since 1946.

History  Concord's first public high school was established in 1846. The original building was the building on the corner of State and School streets. A new school house was built in 1862, which stood until April 1888, when it burned down during a fire started by a chemistry experiment. For the next two years, students took their classes in City Hall. A new high school was built on the same lot, completed and dedicated in September 1890. In 1907, yet another Concord High School, designed to accommodate 500 students, was built on Spring Street in the building which became Kimball School. (The building was demolished in 2012 to make way for the new Christa McAuliffe Elementary School.) The current high school was built in 1927 on Warren Street, with new wings added in 1960 and 1996. Some of the features that Concord High currently has are a new media center (library), student center (cafeteria), performing arts area and four commons areas, each with its own administrative and student community where student lockers are located. ConcordTV, the local public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV station for Concord, is currently located in Concord High. There is a bridge connecting two wings of the building.  Principals  Charles C. Cook was Headmaster for thirty years from 1906 to 1936. Cook began the National Honor Society Chapter which still exists at Concord High School. Other long-serving principals include John E. Reed who was principal from 1939 to 1960, J. Preston Barry from 1961 to 1972, Charlie Foley who was principal from 1973 to 1990, Gene Connolly who was principal from 2001 to 2016. In the recent history of Concord High School, Dr. Christine Rath (principal from 1991 to 1997) oversaw the transformation of the school from a three-year to a four-year school which included ninth-grade students. At the same time Rath assisted in the design of the current high school building which was able to accommodate every high school student in Concord.  Athletics  The current Athletic Director is Steve Mello (two time AD of the year).  School dance  At Concord High's first dance of the 2006-2007 school year, Concord High drew local media attention when administration ejected from a dance about a dozen students for grinding, a style of dancing that the administration deemed overtly sexual for a school function. In protest of this, about 150 other students walked out of the dance. The administration met with student body leaders to try to reach an agreement. They were not able to, and for the first time in the school's history, the homecoming dance was postponed, and every other dance that year was canceled. An exception was made for the senior prom, however.  Notable alumni and faculty  *John Adams, composer *Matt Bonner, former basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs *Edward H.

The Secret Policeman's Ball took place over four consecutive nights in London on 27‚Äì30 June 1979. It was a successor to the 1976 show A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick) (the film of which was titled Pleasure at Her Majesty's) and the 1977 show The Mermaid Frolics. The show was directed by Monty Python alumnus John Cleese and producers Martin Lewis and Peter Walker. It subsequently yielded a one-hour TV special, a full-length film, and two record albums (one each of comedy and music performances). One of the sketches in the show was Peter Cook's nine-minute parody of the biased judge's instructions to the jury in the recently concluded Jeremy Thorpe trial, titled \\"Entirely a Matter for You\\". The sketch was, according to authors Simon Freeman and Barrie Penrose, \\"actually not that different from the original\\". It is considered to be one of the finest works of Cook's career.

Biography Thomas Henry Fisher was born in 1879 at Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. The oldest of three brothers, he became an apprentice to T. Bailey Forman (Nottingham newspaper proprietors and printers) at the young age of fourteen. Numerous paintings and sketches he made outside contract were used by his employers for publishing merchandise like wall calendars. He concurrently attended the Nottingham School of Art. His first published works were probably cartoons for the Nottingham Football Post, in September, 1904. He freelanced at the same time under the name of Thomas Henry. Pastel and watercolour were his chosen mediums at that time. Thomas Henry was associated with the advertising division of Nottingham-based cigarette firm John Players and was reputed to have assisted in the updating of the famous sailor's head, found on the Navy Cut cigarette packet. He married Gertrude Ellen Mensing from Cotgrave in 1906 and settled down in Plumtree, Nottinghamshire, a neighbouring village on the outskirts of Nottingham. Their daughter Marjorie was born in 1911. Thomas Henry's rise as an illustrator was fast. By 1913 he was regularly publishing cartoons in top magazines like Punch. By 1920 he was an established illustrator, having published widely in leading publications like the Strand Magazine and London Mail. Henry defined the image of Richmal Crompton's William for magazines in 1919 and followed it up by illustrating the first William book - Just William, which was published in 1922. He went on to illustrate thirty-three William books. Among his other works of this period were illustrations for numerous other children's books like Our Elizabeth Again by Florence A. Kilpatrick. He was also the first illustrator of Evadne Price's Jane stories when they appeared in the Novel magazine between 1927 and 1937. He illustrated the first three collections of Jane stories at the publishing house of Newnes, which folded into IPC Media (now a branch of Time Warner). However, he signed his name as \\"Marriott\\", as Evadne Price was eager not to associate the Jane stories and the William stories, and disliked the reference to the character of Jane as the \\"female William\\". Thomas Henry was a prolific contributor as a cover artist and illustrator to children's magazines of the period like The Happy Mag, The Crusoe Mag, The Sunny Mag and Tit Bits Summer Annual. He was also a frequent contributor to children's annuals like Blackie's Boys Annual and The Boys' Budget in the same capacity. His first wife Gertrude died prematurely in 1932 and a few years later he married his second wife Anne Bailey, with whom he later settled in Old Dalby, Leicestershire. He also became a successful illustrator of seaside postcards, often saucy ones with double entendres. He started as early as 1913, continuing well into the 1950s. He created a series of postcards for the purpose of fundraising for the National Institute for the Blind, depicting visually handicapped people in poignant situations. He created other sets of postcards, including one of William and his friends, and another depicting a fictitious pair of children - Jane and Herbert. Thomas Henry died in 1962, leaving illustrations for the current William book - William and the Witch, incomplete. He was influenced by the work of Cecil Aldin. Thomas Henry also had a painting displayed at the Royal Academy. William illustrations Thomas Henry created the image of William Brown in 1919 for the Home Magazine. It was not based on any particular child, but rather from the author's description and his own imagination. Nearly forty years old at the time, this was the start of a writer-illustrator relationship with Richmal Crompton that lasted until his death forty-three years later. He illustrated William stories in the Home Magazine (1919‚Äì1922) and in the Happy Mag (1922 onwards). He illustrated and painted book covers for a total of thirty-three William books for the publisher Newnes. He also produced numerous William strip cartoons for magazines. He drew about eight hundred cartoons of three frames per story for Woman's Own magazine from 1947 to 1962. The illustrations for the magazines were done in a traditional hatch style. Surprisingly Thomas Henry met Richmal Crompton face-to-face only once, at a book festival luncheon in Nottingham. Their meeting created some publicity, much to his embarrassment. However, Thomas Henry created all the cartoons with the approval of Richmal Crompton, and would consult her if the publisher's storyline was atypical of the character of William Brown. As William Brown did not age with time, the image of William changed little over forty-three years. However, William's original attire of waistcoat and starched collar was subsequently changed by Henry to a more modern style. At the time of his death Thomas Henry had only completed some of the drawings for the thirty-fourth book William and the Witch. Hence, some illustration in this book are by Thomas Henry and the rest are by his successor Henry Ford. William merchandise Thomas Henry created two William jigsaw puzzles, one William card game, a William magic painting book, a set of William postcards and other merchandise as commercially successful promotion of the William Brown character.

It developed out of the interaction between a cold front and an upper level trough on October 10 located to the south of Bermuda, and quickly strengthened as an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda on October 12, producing hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone on the 12th and a tropical cyclone on the 13th. Karen strengthened to reach 80 mph (130 km/h) winds as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. It quickly became extratropical. On Bermuda, winds from the precursor extratropical storm produced moderate damage, primarily to power lines and marine interests. Over 2/3 of the island's power subscribers were left without power during the worst of the storm, and several boats sank or ran aground from the high winds. Damage on Bermuda totaled to over $1.4 million (2001 USD; $1.7 million 2008 USD). In Atlantic Canada, Tropical Storm Karen produced light winds and rain, but caused minimal damage. Meteorological history A cold front stalled a couple hundred miles southeast of Bermuda on October 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence‚Äîthe rate at which a fluid moves‚Äîthe area became baroclinically unstable. This caused the interaction between the trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345 miles (555 km) southeast of Bermuda on October 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late on October 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late on October 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early on October 12 while located about 35 miles (55 km) south of Bermuda. While passing to the south of Bermuda, the subtropical storm maintained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h), with wind gusts on the island surpassing 100 mph (160 km/h). After becoming dissociated from the Westerlies, the system turned northward, and began to develop convection over the center. In addition, the frontal characteristics of the subtropical storm continually weakened. On October 13, based on an Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit observation that stated that a warm core was present throughout the system, the National Hurricane Center designated the system as a tropical storm, and gave it the name Karen. At this point, Karen was located 200 miles (320 km) north of Bermuda. Karen slowly strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and the storm intensified to a hurricane later on October 13. Convection continued to develop, and organized into a ring around the eye as Karen reached its peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) on October 14 while located about 400 miles (640 km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Tropical Storm Karen shortly after landfall in Nova Scotia on October 15 Karen quickly weakened as it moved over cooler waters, and late on October 14 it degenerated back into a tropical storm as it accelerated northward. Convection gradually decreased, and Karen made landfall on southwestern Nova Scotia with winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) on October 15. Karen retained its tropical characteristics during and after making landfall, based on a research flight out of Halifax intended to study the early stages of extratropical transition. The flight reported arced bands and a warm-core system transitioning into a more typical mid-latitude system. Under the influence of a mid-latitude system, the storm turned sharply to the northeast, and after losing the remaining of its convection it became extratropical shortly after landfall. Continuing northward, the remnant low quickly weakened, and dissipated as it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm over the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Preparations On October 10, as the precursor extratropical storm was forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale and later a storm warning for the island, expecting winds of 50 to 60 mph (60 to 95 km/h). Several radio interviews and television stations issued information on the expected storm. Many residents believed they were insufficiently warned, though it is acknowledged that emergency managers and citizens pay less attention to gale warnings then they do for tropical cyclone warnings. On October 12, as the storm was passing to the south of the island, officials closed all schools and government offices. Many private businesses closed as well. At the time of Karen's landfall, gale warnings were issued for coastal waters, while inland wind warnings were in effect for Cape Breton. In addition, heavy rainfall warnings were issued for large portions of Nova Scotia including Halifax, southeastern New Brunswick, Fundy National Park, and Prince Edward Island. Impact Bermuda Subtropical Storm Karen passing near Bermuda on October 12 While passing to the south of the island, the tight pressure gradient between the precursor extratropical storm and high pressures resulted in strong winds on the island, including sustained winds of hurricane status at Fort George. Gusts on the island officially peaked at 100 mph (161 km/h) at Devonshire. A cruise ship anchored at harbor reported a wind gust of 118 mph (190 km/h), though it could have been caused by a downdraft. The storm also dropped moderate rainfall of just over 3 inches (76 mm), resulting in minor flooding of streets. Because the storm developed quickly, wave-induced beach erosion was minor. The strong winds left considerable tree and powerline damage. At the worst of the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000 power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001 USD, $468,700 2008 USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87 boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001 USD, $809,600 2008 USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175 properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001 USD, $517,400 2008 USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4 million (2001 USD, $1.7 million 2008 USD). No fatalities were reported, though a few storm-related injuries occurred. Canada Tropical Storm Karen produced light to moderate winds across Atlantic Canada, peaking at 47 mph (76 km/h) with a gust of 64 mph (103 km/h) in Cape George in Antigonish County, Nova Scotia, along with a 26 mph (42 km/h) report in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Rainbands in the storm dropped light rainfall of up to 1.8 inches (46 mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and 1.4 inches (35 mm) in Saint John, New Brunswick, most of which fell in a short amount of time. Skewed to the left side of the transitioning storm, the rainfall was beneficial for the drought-stricken areas of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Due to the fast- moving nature of the storm, though, most areas reported only around half an inch of rain. A buoy in Halifax Harbour reported wave heights of up to 16.7 feet (5.1 m), causing breaking waves at docks white caps along the ocean. Damage in Canada was minor due to the storm, limited to an uprooted tree in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and several other trees with damaged branches. There were no injuries or fatalities in Canada.

History The band got started around April in 1998, when the original members all came to Tokyo from the countryside where they all lived, all for different reasons. They met, and decided to start a band. First called Gyorai, they soon changed their name to The Back Horn. This name was based on Matsuda's misreading of the \\"backhoe\\" he used in his construction work. From the beginning, one of the features of the band was a harsh sound and lyrics dealing with decadence and destruction, war, peace, isolation, love and death. In a 2005 interview, the band members listed Nirvana and Radiohead as inspiration for their musical style. Following their first notable performance at the Fuji Rock Festival in 1999, they released a mini-album Doko e Yuku on Kando Records. Seven months after that, they released their first full-length, Yomigaeru Hi. After this, the band got signed to a major label, Speedstar Records. Although they, to this day, still remain on Speedstar Records' roster, they're still often thought of as an indie band. It was also around this time when Hirabayashi decided to leave the band. It was only after the release of their first album release on Speedstar Records, Ningen Program, that they found a new bassist, Okamine Koushu, though he wasn't immediately made a full-time member. He was however involved in recording of the next album, Shinzou Orchestra, and while touring for the album, the band announced that he was now an official member. In the period when The Back Horn were between bassists, vocalist Yamada overtook bass duties. As the band was becoming increasingly popular, they were asked to provide music for 2 movies: Kiyoshi Kurosawa's Bright Future and Kazuaki Kiriya's Casshern, releasing the album Ikiru Sainou in between them. After a couple of tours, including a show at the Rock In Japan festival, a couple of single releases and the release of their first live DVD, they released their 5th full-length, Headphone Children, considered by many to be a concept album. The song Kiseki from the album was used in the horror movie Zoo. The tour following Headphone Children was a huge success and the band decided to release a live album of it, entitled Ubugoe Chainsaw which contained the best performances of songs from the tour. 2 months later, Back Horn played their first show in Europe, at a festival in Barcelona, Spain. The band then released several singles and did some shows, including an acoustic street tour with only Yamada and Suganami, where they performed on the streets of Japan for free. In April, 2006 they released their 6th full-length, Taiyou no Naka no Seikatsu, and then their 7th album in May, 2007, self-titled The Back Horn. Their 16th major single release, Wana, was used as the first ending theme to the 2007 anime series Mobile Suit Gundam 00. In January, 2008, they released a compilation album Best the Back Horn to celebrate their 10-year anniversary. Their 8th album titled Pulse was released on September 3, 2008.

The School consists of a Boys and a Girls section. As of 2014, the student population consists of over 3000 children ranging from ages 5 to 20. It is a K-12 educational institution with a certified curriculum (Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Islamabad) that has been gradually upgraded over the years. The school operates in two separate shifts of 06.45‚Äì11.30 and 1.30‚Äì5.30 hours. The school was founded as a small room school in 1966 by late Abbas Hussain Malik . History With the oil boom in the Sixties, Saudi Arabia was becoming a nucleus of trade and commercial activity. Pakistani engineers, doctors and professionals from all walks of life were pouring in. But, in the absence of any Pakistani educational institution, they could not keep their families in Khobar. There was a pressing need for a school. At that juncture, Mr. Abbas Hussain Malik founded the Pakistan Community High School (PCHS). The school has 2 campuses and 52 teachers as of 2014.  Co-curricular Activities  All monitors join a house to ensure competition in activities. The monitors are encouraged to participate in the following activities: * Debates (English, Urdu) * Qira'at Competition * Sports Week * School Magazine * Quiz Competition * Boys Scouting * Meena Bazar * Fun and Frolics Societies, such as Debating Society, Computer Club and Literary Society, run co-curricular activities. Academics Pakistan International School has two wings. The beginners course starts from the Girls wing where children start their journey for quest of knowledge. Boys and Girls study from Kindergarten to Class III in the same wing. After their promotion to Class IV, the boys and girls join their respective wings. Junior school occupies central position in the overall set up of Pakistan International School, Al-Khobar. The students of the Junior school are assessed and promoted internally at the end of the Academic Year. It is, however, pertinent to note here that the Annual Examination is not the only criterion through which the progress and academic development of the students is assessed. Monthly Progress Report is sent at the end of each month. The teacher's evaluation, monthly tests and the examinations are just a few of the yard sticks by which each student is assessed and evaluated. Parent/Teacher meetings are held twice in an Academic Year so that the parents' can discuss their child's academic progress. PIS Khobar.com - http://www.piskhobar.com Extra-curricular activities Extra-Curricular activities include competitions for Model making, Speech, Naat, Qirat (the recitation of quran), Essay writing. A sports day is held during winter in every year at Al-Nahda Club (Saudi Arabia). Sports day includes Musical chairs and many more activities like learning through documentaries etc. Fees The admission fee is SR.600. In case of the student's name being struck off from the rolls, re- admission fee is SR.100. The school takes tuition fee, transport fee, laboratory fee and exam fee separately. Students are fined a big amount for misconduct.

It was originally written and published in French. The English translation was produced by Marjolijn de Jagar, and published by Ruminator Press in 2001, with a foreword by Wole Soyinka. The novel was published posthumously. Plot Boualem Yekker is a bookseller in a country probably modelled on Algeria. His home is firmly in the grip of religious fundamentalists, but only recently: it was once a republic, but now it is a \\"Community in the Faith\\". Djaout presents readers with a terrifying world of religious fundamentalism comparable to Orwell's 1984, but substituting a religious dictatorship for a purely political one. At first Yekker is only on the periphery of danger. He is \\"neither elegant nor talented\\", which puts him out of the spotlight: \\"what is persecuted above all, and more than people's opinions, is their ability to create and propagate beauty.\\" Still, Yekker is a purveyor of these outrageous \\"idea- and beauty-filled objects\\" known as books, so he doesn't fit in too well in this new, retrograde society. Business isn't exactly booming, of course. Touchingly Djaout describes Yekker's brief moments of hope when he sees people gazing in the shop window. But there is hardly a market for the sorts of books he has any longer. One acquaintance, Ali Elbouliga, still comes to while away time there. Otherwise, Yekker remains largely alone in his bookish world‚Äîand the books ultimately prove almost as much a burden as a solace. Family life also gets more complicated when his daughter turns on him. \\"The illness of fanaticism had attacked her.\\" She is transformed, \\"covered with superior certainties\\". Yekker tries to continue to live his life in the manner he is accustomed to, but there is no escape from the encroaching fanaticism. It crushes all opposition. Any semblance of rationality is done away with. Even weather forecasts are banned, as if these called some all- mighty's grand plan (and his power) into question. (What a pathetic god it must be they're protecting, if he can be threatened by mortals' barely educated guesses at tomorrow's weather; doesn't the fact that the meteorologists barely ever get it right instead reinforce the idea of divine omnipotence?) Imagination is dulled, \\"the world has become aphasic, opaque, and sullen; it is wearing mourning clothes.\\" Books \\"constitute the safest refuge against this world of horror\\" all around Yekker, but the books are also a danger to him. Eventually they must make place for \\"the one, the irremovable Book of resigned certainty.\\" The threats against Yekker mount. What is, at first, almost harmless child's play intensifies to very real danger. Might conquers right: They have understood the danger in words, all the words they cannot manage to domesticate and anesthetize. For words, put end to end, bring doubt and change. Words above all must not conceive of the utopia of another form of truth, of unsuspected paths, of another place of thought.

The main floor of the Palace houses the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Ferrara (National Painting Gallery of Ferrara). History To accommodate the growth of Ferrara, in 1492 the Duke Ercole I d'Este demolished the medieval walls of the city on the north, and had the court architect, Biagio Rossetti, design an urban expansion known as the Addizione Erculea. Rosetti was commissioned by Sigismondo d'Este, brother of the Duke Ercole I, to build this palace at the prestigious intersection of what was to be the Decumanus Maximus (now encompassing Corsi Porta Po, Biagio Rossetti, and Porta Mare) and Cardo Maximus (Corso Ercole I d'Este) of the \\"urban addition\\". It was built between 1493 and 1503. Used as a residential home by the Este family and, starting in 1641, by the Villa marquis, in 1832 the palace was acquired by the municipality of Ferrara to house the National Gallery of Art and the Civic University. Architecture View across the courtyard The most striking feature is the bugnato of the exterior walls: it consists of some 8,500 white (with pink veins) marble blocks carved to represent diamonds, hence its name. The positioning of the diamonds varies in order to maximize the light reflected off the building, creating quite the visual effect. The palace is also well known for its candelabra and the phytomorphic corner motifs. Inside, it has a typical Renaissance courtyard with a cloister and a marble well; the latter is a characteristic typical of gardens in Ferrara. Pinacoteca Nazionale di Ferrara Entrance to the Pinacoteca Nazionale The main floor of the palazzo houses the Pinacoteca Nazionale (), with paintings from the Ferrarese School from the Middle Ages up to the 18th century. The oldest paintings are large frescoes (Triumph of sant'Agostino by Serafino da Modena) and wooden panels with gold-leaf backgrounds, such as the Madonna and Child by Gentile da Fabriano. The main artists from the 15th century in Ferrara represented in the museum are Cosm√® Tura (Giudizio and Martyrdom of san Maurelio), Ercole de' Roberti, Vicino da Ferrara and Michele Pannonio. There are works from the Este family collections, including a work by Andrea Mantegna (Cristo con l'animula della Madonna). There are also two works by unidentified artists from the collection of the Marquis Leonello d'Este at the Belfiore Palace. The major 16th-century Ferrarese painter, Garofalo, is represented by a number of works, including Pala Costabili, done in collaboration with Dosso Dossi. The period of mannerism is represented by Bastianino, who uses a technique similar to that of Michelangelo in his works. Among the other artists in the collection are Amerigo Aspertini, Giuseppe Avanzi, Baldassarre d'Este, Jacopo Bambini, Bastarolo (Giuseppe Mazzuoli), Giovanni Bellini, Jacopo Bellini, il Ortolano, Carlo Bononi (1569‚Äì1632), Vittore Carpaccio, Girolamo da Carpi (1500‚Äì1556), Agostino Carracci, Ludovico Carracci, Coltellini (1480‚Äì1535/42), Francesco del Cossa (1435/1436‚Äì1478), Lorenzo Costa (‚Äì1535), Giulio Cromer, Girolamo Domenichini, Battista Dossi (‚Äì1548), Francesco Francia (1450‚Äì1517), Gaetano Gandolfi, Ubaldo Gandolfi, Maestro degli Occhi Spalancati, Maineri, Giovanni da Modena (active 1398), Ludovico Mazzolino (c.1480-1528/1530), Panetti, Giacomo Parolini, Nicol√≤ Pisano (Nicol√≤ dell'Abrugia), Nicol√≤ Roselli (1500‚Äì), Maurelio Scannavini, Scarsellino (‚Äì1620), Simone de Crocifissi, Tintoretto, Bartolomeo Vivarini, and Giuseppe Zola (1672‚Äì1743).Palazzo Milzetti website, entry on Pinacoteca.

History Foundation The Bank's former Head Office in St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh British Linen Company carving in Govan The Edinburgh-based British Linen was \\"the only British bank to be formed on the basis of an industrial charter\\" and, as the name suggests, its roots lay in the Scottish linen industry. The original driving force behind the formation of the British Linen Company (as it was first named) was Andrew Fletcher, Lord Milton. He was a lawyer landowner, had been active in the promotion of The Royal Bank of Scotland and, according to Checkland, \\"from 1735 to 1766 he was the most important man in the politics of Scotland.\\" He had helped establish the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland and was the chairman of the board's Linen Committee. In 1727 he had been instrumental in the formation of the Edinburgh Linen Co- Partnery and in the early 1740s Milton wanted to expand it, make it national and capable of marketing in England.S G Checkland Scottish Banking a History 1695‚Äì1973 (1975) The men who were to see this concept to fruition were \\"two young and enterprising Edinburgh linen manufacturers\\", Ebenezer McCulloch and William Tod. They became the managers of the new enterprise (and substantial shareholders), Milton himself later becoming deputy manager. Their scheme was for \\"a company on a much bigger scale than hitherto seen in Scotland\\" and at the height of its operations in the 1750s \\"it was probably not just the largest single firm in the Scottish linen industry but in the Scottish economy as a whole\\". It handled every stage in the manufacture of linen cloth and employed thousands of spinners and weavers.Alastair Durie, The British Linen Company 1745‚Äì1775 (1996) In 1745 a prospectus was duly issued for \\"The Company for Improving the Linen Manufactury in Scotland\\". However, the lack of limited liability proved an obstacle to fundraising, and the alternative route of a Royal Charter was sought. Progress of the petition was slow due to the Jacobite rebellion and it made no mention of Scotland: \\"the Scots were looked on with open suspicion as open supporters of the exiled House of Stewart.\\" The Charter was eventually granted in 1746 in the name of the British Linen Company.Charles Malcolm, The History of the British Linen Bank (1950) Move into banking In what appeared incidental at the time, the charter included the right to bank unless this was specifically prohibited; in years to come, there was to be some uncertainty as to how definitive these rights were. McCulloch and Tod were keen from the outset to provide banking services to their trading partners: \\"they had set their minds on having, \`like banks\`, promissory notes to pay to agents, weavers, manufacturers and other customers\\"; these were duly issued in 1747. However, \\"three years later the Company issued true bank notes, payable on demand, and non-interest bearing.\\" Despite the increasing provision of banking services, the Company remained primarily an industrial concern through the 1750s but with limited financial success. There were arguments between the founders over withdrawing from manufacture to just financing and marketing other producers; Tod succeeded in this but left in 1759. Nevertheless, in the 1760s British Linen \\"began to make the transition from manufacturing to finance, and steadily reduced its commitment to the linen industry.\\" McCulloch resigned in 1763 and agreed to take over all the Company's manufacturing leaving British Linen to confine itself to financing. However, new management discovered that the financial position was worse than expected and the subsequent failure of McCulloch's business meant British Linen got some of its old manufacturing back again. The transition from linen to banking was not complete until the mid 1770s\\". It was not just the difficulty in withdrawing from the linen industry that made the transition drawn out ‚Äì there remained uncertainty over the legality of their banking. In 1759 the Company refused a loan to a linen manufacturer because it was \\"not consistent with the rules\\". In 1762 the Company actually took counsel's opinion on the legality of banking and it was only on receiving reassurance that it agreed to open deposit accounts for \\"friends\\". A formal \\"Plan of Trade\\" was prepared in 1764 to develop banking business but even then the directors were clear that they were not trying to rival the Royal Bank or Bank of Scotland and it was not until 1767 that the first credits were given to non-linen people. For years there remained a fear that legitimacy of the Company's banking activities could be challenged by other banks and there were repeated attempts to obtain a new charter. Despite objections from the Royal and Bank of Scotland, the Company succeeded in 1813 but it was still refused permission to call itself British Linen Bank ‚Äì a status not achieved until 1906.  Expansion  As British Linen began to develop its banking business, it found it had a ready-made structure in the form of the old linen agencies and these were used to varying degrees. Around 1760 some of the Company's agents \\"were direct to circulate the Company's notes and to 'open accounts with such friends as could be depended on Branches opened after 1760 were designed to carry out banking transactions. However, it was not until 1785 that \\"the time had come for the Company to set up a permanent branch system, with agents related to the Company by proper agreements.\\" The unsystematic progression (or otherwise) from linen agency to bank branch makes it difficult to be certain about the number of branches the Company had in the late eighteenth century. Malcolm's list of branch openings suggests that there were 18 bank branches by 1800 and a further 25 added in the first half of the nineteenth century. The pace of activity accelerated in the second half of the century with over 70 branch openings. The one thing that British Linen did not do was to acquire other banks. The one exception was in 1837 when it bought the Paisley Banking Company with its three branches. By 1901, British Linen's branch network was given as joint third to the Royal Bank and the Commercial Bank of Scotland.A W Kerr, History of Banking in Scotland, Appendix B (1902) Amalgamations British Linen, now formally a bank, had distanced itself from the amalgamations in Scottish banking and by 1914 it had \\"declined from a position somewhere in the middle of the scale to the bottom\\". By the end of the First World War British Linen realised it needed an association with a larger bank with good overseas connections and agreement was reached for Barclays to buy the bank in 1919. As with other Scottish banks, geographic sensitivities led to British Linen being referred to as an affiliate rather than a subsidiary and except for the presence of a Barclays' director \\"the affiliation made no difference in the conduct of the Bank's business\\". During the inter-war period, more than 40 new branches were opened giving British Linen a Scottish network of over 170 branches by 1939. In 1969 Barclays sold British Linen to Bank of Scotland in exchange for a 35 per cent holding in the latter bank. Merchant bank The merger with the Bank of Scotland was finalised with the Bank of Scotland Order Confirmation Act 1970, confirming the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the British Linen Bank to the Bank of Scotland, and the two were quickly integrated ‚Äì for example, the British Linen Bank's Glasgow headquarters building on Ingram Street was demolished by the Bank of Scotland to make way for a concrete office building which was built in 1971. The Act however allowed British Linen Bank to continue as a separate company, and in 1977 the bank resumed as the merchant bank arm of the Bank of Scotland. However, in 1999, the Bank of Scotland decided to stop using the British Linen Bank name, renaming its merchant bank activities as Bank of Scotland Treasury Services, later HBOS Treasury Services following the bank's merger with Halifax plc to form HBOS. In April 2000 the British Linen Bank finally closed its headquarters doors at 4 Melville Street, Edinburgh. British Linen Advisers In 2000, the British Linen Advisers was formed by the acquisition of the corporate finance operations from the Bank of Scotland by an independent group of businessmen and women. British Linen Advisers closed in Edinburgh in 2008. In popular culture Robert Louis Stevenson's classic historical adventure novel, Kidnapped (1886), ends at 2 PM on 25 August 1751, outside the British Linen Company in Edinburgh, Scotland, where its protagonist, David Balfour, plans to manage his inherited income. This is precisely where the book's sequel, Catriona (1893), begins.

The Secret Policeman's Ball 2006 was the title of the show staged as a benefit for human rights organization Amnesty International at London's Royal Albert Hall in October 2006. The show title was a conscious reprise of the title of the 1979 Amnesty benefit show that heralded the organization's breakthrough in public awareness and fundraising. The 1979 show The Secret Policeman's Ball, organised by John Cleese and producers Martin Lewis & Peter Walker, led to greater participation by comedians and rock musicians in further benefit shows for Amnesty and other social and political causes. It also led to the series of benefit shows that are informally known as The Secret Policeman's Balls. The 2006 show was coordinated by British comedian Eddie Izzard. Internationally-known performers Izzard and actor Richard E. Grant were joined by locally-popular comedic talents including Russell Brand, Jon Culshaw, Al Murray, The Mighty Boosh and Omid Djalili. American comedic actor Chevy Chase made a cameo appearance in one skit. Music was supplied by The Zutons and The Magic Numbers. Singer Natalie Imbruglia appeared in a routine alongside David Armand spoofing her hit song \\"Torn\\". The show also featured a series of computer-generated animations highlighting global political issues, including the American detention centre at Guantanamo Bay and the international arms trade. Certain high-profile performers such as Jennifer Saunders and Ian McKellen previously advertised on Amnesty's website as confirmed participants did not appear in the show, but participated as voice actors in some of the animations shown throughout. The 4-hour show was videotaped and 70 minutes of highlights were broadcast by Britain's Channel Four station on October 31, 2006. A DVD was released on 4 December with a duration of 199 minutes plus 83 minutes of extra material. Included in the 'extras' section were some of the animations from the show itself. There was also a series of \\"cinecasts\\" in which the Royal Albert Hall event was shown live in 17 cinemas in major British cities. Several reviews in the UK media noted that, with a few exceptions, the performances and material were not of the highest calibre and did not compare to the quality of the original shows from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The critical comments were tempered by references to the fact that the event was held for a good cause - e.g. the respected Chortle.co.uk website stated: \\"a charity gig is much like the infants‚Äô Nativity play, successful in its own terms and not deserving of too much harsh scrutiny.\\" (The contrast was perhaps made vivid by the airing on Channel Four of the film of the 1981 show The Secret Policeman's Other Ball just a few days before the new show.)

Sanitary districts were the first sub-autonomous entities established in Thailand. A first such district was created in Bangkok by a royal decree of King Chulalongkorn in 1897. The king had learned about the sanitary districts in England during his European trip earlier that year, and he wanted to try this local administration in his country as well. Tha Chalom District became the second such district, created in 1906 and responsible for parts of Mueang Samut Sakhon District, Samut Sakhon Province. In 1907 the act on operations of sanitary districts codified the regulations, and with the Local Administration Act of 1914 two levels of sukhaphiban were introduced, the sukhaphiban mueang for towns and sukhaphiban tambon for rural areas. The number of sanitary districts grew to 35 in 1935, when these however were converted into municipalities (thesaban). New sanitary district were again established starting in 1952 by prime minister Phibun Songkhram.

He served as Chancellor of Lithuania between 1443 and 1458 and was a very close advisor and mentor to Casimir IV Jagiellon before the Grand Duke became the 3rd Jagiellonian King of Poland. Gostautas was not his surname, but a pagan Lithuanian given name retained after baptism by his immediate ancestor, while Jonas was his Christian name. His heirs, e.g., his sons like Martynas Go≈°tautas, perhaps inherited the name as a surname. In 1413 at the Union of Horod≈Ço, Jonas was adopted by the Polish nobles into the Abdank clan. First mentioned in 1413, Jonas Go≈°tautas served as a marshal during the late reign of Vytautas the Great. Following death of Vytautas he continued his duties under ≈†vitrigaila and sided with him against Vytautas' brother Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis. In 1431 while defending Lutsk from the Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis' Polish-Lithuanian assault he was captured and imprisoned. When fighting erupted between ≈†vitrigaila and Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis for Grand Duke title, Jonas Go≈°tautas supported Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis, who appointed him as governor of Smolensk later on. He served as governor of Smolensk for around four years until 1440 assassination of Grand Duke Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis forced him to leave this position. Serving many Duchy rulers he managed to gain and hold tremendous wealth and thus he became one of the richest noblemen of Lithuania. Death of Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis left empty the throne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Jonas Go≈°tautas, as well as other noblemen of the Council of Lords supported Casimir Jagiellon as a candidate for the throne. Polish magnates hoped and insisted that thirteen-year-old boy remained only a vicegerent of Wladyslaw III, the Polish King and his brother, in Lithuania.J.

But when Polish delegation bringing Casimir arrived in Vilnius in 1440 he was proclaimed as Grand Duke by the Council of Lords, contrary to the wishes of the Polish politicians‚Äîan act supported and coordinated by Jonas Go≈°tautas. In this way fragile personal union between Grad Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland was dissolved. The news in Kingdom of Poland about proclamation of Casimir as Grand Duke was met with hostility towards Lithuania, even to the point of military threats. Tykocin Castle, commissioned by Go≈°tautas in 1433 Jonas Go≈°tautas secured positions as palatine (voivode) of Trakai in 1433 (gift from Grand Duke Sigismund), and from 1443 palatine of Vilnius and Chancellor of Lithuania. Holding the most important positions in the state and supporting young Grand Duke he became actual ruler of Lithuania until young Duke came of age and started his own policies as early as 1444. He successfully initiated the expansion of the Council of Lords' powers, made structural reforms, led assault on rebelling Kiev. When in 1444 W≈Çadys≈Çaw died at battle of Varna, Polish politicians and leading lords insisted that Casimir should return to Kingdom of Poland and in 1445 the general assembly of nobility in Sieradz elected Casimir the new Polish king. After several years of protracted negotiations regarding Casimir's return to Kingdom of Poland as king, Grand Duke, Go≈°tautas and other Lithuanian noblemen raised conditions before Casimir was to reign in Poland. Grand Duke, already emancipated from Go≈°tautas, insisted on equality of nobility of both states, that Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland remain separate states, governed by one or two rulers, guarantee of the completeness of Grand Duchy borders and his own right to return to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at will.Encyclopedia Lituanica.

Most volumes contained five (although a considerable minority consisted of three, four, or six) current best-selling novels and nonfiction books which were abridged (or \\"condensed\\") specifically for Reader's Digest.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02680426 Springer.com: \\"The continuous publication of the Reader's Digest Condensed Books directmail subscription series since 1950 is a cultural phenomenon.\\"]Publishers Weekly: \\"Reader's Digest Condensed Book Series to Get Wider Distribution\\", March 2015 The series was published from 1950 until 1997, when it was renamed Reader's Digest Select Editions. The series was popular; a 1987 New York Times article estimated annual sales of 10 million copies.The New York Times: \\"New Editor at Digest's Condensed Books\\", August 2, 1987 Despite this popularity, old copies are notoriously difficult to sell.\\"Readers Digest Condensed Books as diffiult to dispose of as bins of radioactive waste\\"Clayton Library: \\"We DON‚ÄôT ACCEPT Reader‚Äôs Digest Condensed Books‚Äìthey do not sell.\\". For much of their publication schedule, the volumes were issued four times each year. Each year the company produced a Volume 1 (winter), Volume 2 (spring), Volume 3 (summer), and Volume 4 (autumn). In later years they added a Volumes 5, and then a Volume 6, going to a bi-monthly schedule by the early 1990s. The series was produced for 47 years (1950‚Äì1997), until being renamed Reader's Digest Select Editions. (Note: UK editions seem to have been somewhat different from USA editions. Pre-1992 Canadian editions also contain different titles.) Occasional books such as The Leopard (Summer 1960), The Days Were Too Short (Autumn 1960), and Papillon (Autumn 1970) were not published in English originally but were abridgments of translations. In some cases, advanced copies of the hardcover edition were printed in paperback form. In a few cases, new editions of older works (Up from Slavery, published originally in 1901 (Autumn 1960), A Roving Commission: My Early Life, published originally in 1930 (Autumn 1951) or Goodbye Mr. Chips, published originally in 1934 (Summer 1961)) were also among the condensed selections. 1950s 1950 Volume 1 - Spring * The Show Must Go On - Elmer Rice * The Cry and the Covenant - Morton Thompson * Autobiography of Will Rogers - Donald Day, editor * Cry, the Beloved Country - Alan Paton Volume 2 - Summer * The Wooden Horse ‚Äì Eric Williams * Home Town ‚Äì Cleveland Amory * Visibility Unlimited ‚Äì Dick Grace * The Way West ‚Äì A.

He served as the editor of The Times of India from 1978 till 1988. He was sympathetic to Hindu nationalism and authored books on the subject, the best known of which, The Hindu Phenomenon, was published posthumously. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1989. Personal life Girilal Jain was born in a rural village some 50 miles (80 kilometres) south- east of Delhi. He received a bachelor's degree from Delhi University. He married Sudarshan Jain in 1951.

His views Khushwant Singh wrote that, towards the end of his career, Girilal Jain's writings showed a \\"distinct anti-Muslim, anti-Christian and anti-Sikh bias.\\" Jain was reportedly fired as the editor of the Times of India as a result of his Hindutva sympathies. After retirement, he became an even more vocal supporter of the Hindutva organisations and penned the book The Hindu Phenomenon which was edited and published by his daughter Meenakshi Jain posthumously. Girilal Jain welcomed the movement for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya as part of the process of Hindu self-renewal and self-affirmation.back page, The Hindu Phenomenon, . He believed that the political-economic order that Jawaharlal Nehru had fashioned was as much in its last throes as its progenitor, the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist- Stalinist order. He believed that the two major planks of this order, secularism and socialism, have \\"lost much of their old glitter\\" while the third, non-alignment, has become redundant.editors note, The Hindu Phenomenon, According to him, the concept of nation is alien to Hindu temperament and genius. For, it emphasized the exclusion of those who did not belong to the charmed circle (territorial, linguistic or ethnic) as much as it emphasized the inclusion of those who fell within the circle. By contrast, the essential spirit of Hinduism was inclusivist, and not exclusivist by definition. Such a spirit must seek to abolish and not build boundaries. That is why, he held, that Hindus could not sustain an anti-Muslim feeling, except temporarily and, that too under provocation.page vi, editors note, The Hindu Phenomenon, Jain was criticized in the Congressional Record volume 142, issue 137, (September 28, 1996) published by the U.S. Government Publishing Office for his 1982 Times Of India editorial titled \\"De-Turbaning of Sikhs\\" for its anti-Sikh bias.

The building has been visited by notable figures such as Henry V, and was owned by the celebrities Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. Today, the remnants of the abbey are owned by the company Bijou Wedding Venues and are used to host weddings. History Notley Abbey was founded in between 1154 and 1164 by the second Earl of Buckingham, Walter Giffard and his wife, Ermengard. The house was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist and was made to house Augustinian canons. Despite its lack of historical fame, the Notley Abbey was one of the largest and richest Augustinian monasteries in the Oxford region. Notley Abbey was originally meant to fuse the lifestyles of monastic and apostolic people, forming a middle ground between monks and secular clergy; however, the monastic lifestyle dominated. The fact that Notley Abbey was constructed at Earl's park in Long Crendon suggests that Augustinians were becoming purely monastic by 1160. Notley Abbey possessed several pieces of land including Lower Winchendon (not acquired until around 1302), Chilton, Princes Risborough, and Stragglethorpe in Lincolnshire. These lands helped generate revenue, but the abbey's primary source of income came from tithes from appropriated churches. Traditionally, a secular vicar served an abbey's appropriated churches, but in 1258, Alexander IV granted Notley Abbey permission to serve their appropriated churches by their own canons in person. In 1461, Notley Abbey absorbed a small priory of Chetwood, thus considerably adding to its revenue sources. The abbey was visited by Henry IV who stayed there after the battle of Radcot Bridge. Henry V also stayed at Notley Abbey. Notley Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1538. By about 1730, the abbey reached farmhouse status, but was regenerated in 1890. The abbot's house and part of the cloister were kept as a private house that remains today. Architecture Notley Abbey was originally built based on the medieval architecture (12th and 13th century) popular during the era of its construction. The stone-built main residence is L-shaped and two-storied throughout. The reconstruction of Notley Abbey in 1890 introduced architecture more reminiscent of the late medieval period, specifically in the replacement of Georgian casement windows with those of the Tudor form. When Notley Abbey was excavated in 1937, only the abbot's house and portions of the western and southern claustral buildings were relatively intact. The church was nearly completely underground and, to the disappointment of the excavation team, its foundations had been previously dug up for road repair. Thus, the general plan and dimensions of the church outlined by the team are rough estimates. The foundation was set in the early 1160s in Romanesque style, and soon after the crossing, transepts, and an eastern wing or choir were built. Around the year 1200, construction continued westward and the nave was joined to the crossing. These western additions followed a different style of architecture, either Early English or transitional. The excavation team estimates that by about a century after the foundation was built, the church and claustral buildings were complete. The eastern wing was extended or redone in the early 14th century. In the 15th century, the central crossing was partially rebuilt in the perpendicular style and the main range of the abbot's house was built. Just about 10 years before the dissolution of the monasteries, the western range of the abbot's house was completed. Ownership When Notley Abbey was dissolved, it was given as an enfeoffment to John London. In 1944, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh purchased the remains of the Abbey, after they found their home destroyed by a bomb raid that took place during the war. During their residence, the couple was known for holding parties at the house. It was also used for the filming of several movies. They lived in the house until 1960, when financial trouble motivated the couple to sell the building to a Canadian couple that had made Olivier a favourable offer. In 2006, Notley Abbey was purchased by Mark and Jo Cutmore-Scott as part of their company, Bijou Wedding Venues. The house is now hired out for private weddings and events.

Established in Queens, New York, United States, in 1985, the band appeared at the seminal club CBGBs and other punk and heavy metal related venues in the New York area between 1985 and 2005. The band released 2 full- length albums and a series of demos, singles, and EPs throughout their career. The Six and Violence is also featured on hardcore and punk compilations from the 1980s and 1990s. The band consisted of 6 members with line-up changes over 20 years. The most consistent line-up consisted of Kurt Stenzel on vocals, Paul Gazzara on vocals (deceased February 9, 2005), Dave Miranda on drums, Ray Amico on guitar, J. Garino (deceased 2011) on bass, and Kenneth Kim on cymbals. The live presentation consisted of two vocalists, as well as two percussionists who played drums and cymbals in a standing position. The band appeared twice on the Uncle Floyd Show in 1987. Guitarist Jim Vafeas and Vocalist Chris Sorgie were among the very first members, later replaced by Ray and Paul. The Six and Violence is notable for being unorthodox within the genre of punk and hardcore, and achieved national college radio play based on comedic elements with songs such as \\"Golf\\" and \\"Planet of the Apes\\". Six and Violence is also known for musical departures more associated with progressive rock and Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson guested on 1990s Lettuce Prey album. Lyrical content varied from the silly \\"Hamburger Hairdo\\" to the philosophical, \\"All my Best Friends are Turning into their Dads\\" as well as the controversial ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Gonna Kick God‚Äôs Ass‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeath to Guidos‚Äù. The band continues to get seasonal radio play with their Christmas single ‚ÄúXmas Pigs‚Äù, an anti-consumerist spin on the Black Sabbath classic \\"War Pigs\\". Their 1991 anti-Gulf War single ‚ÄúArmageddon Outta Here‚Äù found relevance with the second U.S. war in Iraq. The Six and Violence is also notable for their use of props and costumes on stage, including men in gorilla suits, women dressed as nuns, and the demolition of television sets and drums with chainsaws. The band was also known for throwing golf balls, hamburgers and bananas at the audience, and often engaged in dangerous stage antics. Recordings The full-length records are Lettuce Prey (Fist Records 1990) and Petty Staycheck (Striving For Togetherness Records 1995). Fist records is notable as having released the first Warzone record, and Striving For Togetherness pioneered a resurgence in New York hardcore with releases by Vision of Disorder, Shutdown, and 25 ta Life. In 2005, The Six and Violence was featured on the soundtrack to the Eidos video game \\"Backyard Wrestling Vol. 2‚Äù as well as a number of independent films. Despite only two full-length recordings, the band retains a loyal cult following in the U.S. and abroad. In October 2007, Dignified Bastard Records released a two disc retrospective of the band's career, containing both \\"Lettuce Prey\\" and Petty Staycheck\\" discs as well as rare and unheard gems. Where are they now Drummer Dave Miranda has been involved with prog rock trio The Magic Elf. He has also been producer for various independent artists. Guitarist Ray Amico is road manager for many established musical acts including his childhood heroes Devo. Singer/Songwriter Kurt Stenzel fronted or co-fronted musical and performance art projects, Cookin‚Äô With Kurt, Lopsided Space Kart and SpacEKrafT. Kurt Stenzel has also been composing for film. His first feature-length film is Jodorowsky's Dune.

It was the first station established on the outside coast of Alaska. History In 1903, the Scotch Cap Light was built. The original lighthouse was a 45-foot (14 meter) wood tower on an octagonal wood building. According to the Coast Guard Historian's Office, the lighthouse was witness to several ship wrecks. In 1909, the cannery supply ship Columbia wrecked. The 194 crew members were guests of the keepers for two weeks before a rescue ship could remove them. In 1930, the Japanese freighter Koshun Maru became lost in a snowstorm and beached near the light. In 1940, a new concrete reinforced lighthouse and fog-signal building was erected near the site of the original lighthouse. In 1942, the Russian freighter Turksib wrecked near the station. The 60 survivors lived at the station for several weeks because rough seas prevented a rescue ship from reaching the station. The 1940 aid to navigation was the \\"twin\\" of the Sand Hills Light in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, replicating much of its design.Sand Hills Light Bed and Breakfast, Exploring the North. On April 1, 1946, the station was destroyed by a massive tsunami created by a powerful earthquake.DrGeorgePC website with photosBaker, James, Tsunami at Scotch Cap, March 2005, Lighthouse Digest.

They were both hosted by Casey Kasem for Premiere Networks (originally AMFM Radio Networks) and premiered on the weekend of March 28, 1998, the same weekend Kasem returned to host American Top 40.http://telemediabroadcasting.com/casey-kasums-top-40/ In contrast with its parent series, which catered to popular music stations, American Top 20 provided the same service to adult contemporary stations. One of the weekly countdowns was produced for hot adult contemporary stations, while the other was produced for mainstream adult contemporary stations. The latter of the two series would see its survey cut in half starting with the week ending on March 20, 2004, becoming known as American Top 10. Beginnings Both versions of American Top 20 had their roots in two other countdowns done by Kasem during his time with the Westwood One Radio Network. In 1992, Westwood One decided to launch a new adult contemporary countdown using the airplay survey data compiled by Radio & Records, the music trade newspaper that at the time was a subsidiary of the company and was already providing information to Kasem for his weekly pop countdown show at the time, Casey's Top 40. The AC program was titled Casey's Countdown and launched on March 7, 1992 as a three-hour program featuring the twenty-five biggest hits of the week. In April 1994, Radio & Records added a hot adult contemporary survey to its tracking dossier and Westwood One launched another weekly countdown on November 5. This program was titled Casey's Hot 20 and was structured in a similar manner to Casey's Countdown, which saw its survey cut to the top twenty songs of the week around the same time. Background Kasem brought his countdown shows to what was then known as AMFM Radio Networks after a contentious battle with Westwood One over his contract status. Just before he had left, Kasem had reacquired the rights to the American Top 40 name and branding from ABC Radio, which he signed over to his new employer. As such, Casey's Countdown and Casey's Hot 20 were both rebranded to American Top 20 when they launched on their new home. Source material Continuing the practice that all of Kasem's countdowns had utilized since 1992, both editions of American Top 20 used the weekly mainstream and hot adult contemporary radio airplay surveys compiled by the trade paper Radio & Records. The survey later was conducted through Mediabase 24/7 and published in R&R;, save for a brief period in 2000 and 2001 when the results were unpublished. After R&R; folded, Mediabase began publishing the weekly survey in USA Today. Show format Each countdown was three hours in length. A brief rundown of the format appears below. *Songs That Topped The Chart Last Week: Kasem's standard practice of recounting the top three songs from the week before. *Chart Extras: To fill out the three hours, past chart hits from the 1970s onward would be played at various intervals. The ones dubbed Extras would have a story behind them, as Kasem was known to do. *Long Distance Dedications: Kasem's signature segment where listeners wrote in or emailed their song requests. The segment became exclusive to AT20 and AT10 following Kasem's departure from AT40, but became less and less of a focal point as the series progressed. Initially one Long Distance Dedication would be featured per hour, but by 2006, only one would be featured over the course of the countdown. *Book of Records and Whatever Happened To...?: two former original AT40 segments later added to the format of both shows in 2005. *Droppers, Biggest Movers, and Longest Charting Song: as on his other countdowns, these were three groups of songs Kasem paid particular attention to in any given week. For any song that debuted, Kasem named the song that fell out of the survey. If there was a song that had made a significant move up the chart from the previous survey, Kasem would also make mention of it. For the longest charting song, Kasem would note how long it had been since the song debuted on the survey. Each countdown initially finished with the top two songs of the week as the final segment. When the mainstream AC edition of AT20 became AT10, that show's final segment featured the final \\"AT10 Spotlight\\" song before the song atop the chart was revealed. America's Top Hits Every week, Kasem would record five sponsored interstitial segments for affiliates with a chart topper from the past and a story behind it. This was a continuation of a practice he began when he was hosting Casey's Top 40 for Westwood One and each segment was intended to air once per day during the week to come. The AC and Hot AC editions of the program each had a separate set of songs, as did American Top 40 until Kasem stepped down from that show in early 2004. Changes made to mainstream AC show When the mainstream AC edition of American Top 20 became American Top 10, a third special feature was added. This was known as the \\"AT10 Spotlight\\" and several songs with an overarching theme were played. For instance, the first edition of the show following its reformatting was \\"Band Members Gone Solo\\", featuring hits from former members of bands that proved to be hits. The Spotlight feature would pop up several times during each show, with the last Spotlight song immediately preceding the number one song of the week. In 2005, New York AC station WLTW added AT10 to its weekend schedule. In a move done strictly for the station, Premiere Networks distributed a heavily edited version of the show that removed the Extras and Spotlight, which reduced the show's length to one hour. Special programming Year-end countdowns Just as he had done on his pop countdown shows, Kasem presided over a countdown of the biggest hits of the year for his adult contemporary audiences. Two countdowns per year aired. Initially, both shows ended the year with a two part, two week Top 60. Beginning in 2002, the Mainstream AC year end specials were cut to a one week Top 30, and the Hot AC shows continued with the Top 60. and continued to do so until January 2009. The lone exception was 1999; an additional thirty-song countdown of the biggest Hot AC and Mainstream AC hits of the previous decade were added and both end of year countdowns were thirty songs in length. The songs that finished at #1 on the Hot AC charts were as follows. *1998: \\"Torn\\", Natalie Imbruglia *1999: \\"Slide\\", Goo Goo Dolls *2000: \\"Everything You Want\\", Vertical Horizon *2001: \\"If You're Gone\\", Matchbox Twenty *2002: \\"Wherever You Will Go\\", The Calling *2003: \\"Unwell\\", Matchbox Twenty *2004: \\"This Love\\", Maroon 5 *2005: \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\", Green Day *2006: \\"Over My Head\\", The Fray *2007: \\"It's Not Over\\", Daughtry *2008: \\"Love Song\\", Sara Bareilles On the mainstream AC chart, these were the songs that finished as the #1 songs of the year.http://www.popradiotop20.com/Year/RR.htm *1998: \\"Truly Madly Deeply\\", Savage Garden *1999: \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\", Phil Collins *2000: \\"I Knew I Loved You\\", Savage Garden *2001: \\"I Hope You Dance\\", Lee Ann Womack *2002: \\"Hero\\", Enrique Iglesias *2003: \\"The Game of Love\\", Santana featuring Michelle Branch *2004: \\"The First Cut Is the Deepest\\", Sheryl Crow *2005: \\"Breakaway\\", Kelly Clarkson *2006: \\"You're Beautiful\\", James Blunt *2007: \\"Waiting on the World to Change\\", John Mayer *2008: \\"Bubbly\\", Colbie Caillat Holiday programming In 2004, many of the stations airing American Top 10 were doing a programming stunt during the latter portion of the annual holiday season. Instead of mixing in songs from the holiday seasons of the past with their normal playlist, they would switch to an all-holiday format from Thanksgiving to Christmas. The producers of the show picked up on this and beginning that year, AT10 would devote the last six programs of the year prior to Christmas to the music of the season. The last two weeks would consist of a two-week, sixty song countdown of the best Christmas songs of all time that would conclude around the week of Christmas. The regular weekly countdown would be put on hold until January, with the special Christmas countdown followed by the year end top 30. Later years Kasem continued to host American Top 40 concurrently with both AT20 series until the weekend of January 3, 2004. After that, he ceded the hosting position to Ryan Seacrest and signed a new contract to continue hosting both of the adult contemporary countdowns. In 2004, Premiere Networks launched a version of AT40 for the same hot adult contemporary stations that AT20 had been targeting. Although such a move made AT20 redundant, Premiere continued to offer Hot AC countdowns hosted by both Casey Kasem (AT20) and Ryan Seacrest (AT40) from December 2004 thru July 2009. Show personnel Most of the staff of AT20 also worked with Kasem at Westwood One and worked on all three of Kasem's countdowns. Lorre Crimi, who worked with Kasem during the final two years of his tenure at Westwood One, continued in her role as producer and was assisted by original AT40 staffers Matt Wilson, who returned to working with Kasem in 1998, and Merrill Shindler, who stayed with Kasem through his days at Westwood One as well. These three were eventually joined on a permanent basis by Toby James Petty. Other assistants to Crimi included Westwood One holdover Bill Strohm, Kasem's daughter Kerri, and Bobbi Kaminski. Westwood One holdovers Michael Cooper, Sal Cocio, and Ray Hernandez served as the primary production engineers and were assisted by various others over the course of the eleven year run of the countdowns. From 1998 until 2001, Joe Cipriano provided the opening and closing announcements for each countdown. Ed McMann and Mike Kasem later held the role. Substitute hosts From time to time Kasem would need to take time off from the countdown for various reasons and would require a substitute host. The first sub host for AT20 was David Perry, who had filled that role for Kasem from 1993 until he left his position at Westwood One in 1998. Over the years, the most frequently used substitute was Ed McMann, who presided over forty editions of the countdown in Kasem's absence and also served as the shows' announcer for several years. For the final two years of the program, Kasem's son Mike was the designated substitute, with ten appearances beginning in late 2007. Ryan Seacrest, Kasem's successor on AT40, would substitute a total of three times in 2003 as he prepared to take over control of the primary countdown. Other substitutes consisted of Steve Streit, the current CEO of Green Dot Corporation; former Access Hollywood co-anchor Pat O'Brien; voiceover artist Joe Cipriano; musician John Ondrasik, who performs as Five for Fighting; and Kasem's former colleague Charlie Tuna, who was the announcer for Kasem's former television program America's Top 10. The end By 2009, Kasem was continuing to record two weekly countdown programs. He was doing so despite the effects of what his doctors had originally thought was Parkinson's disease when he was diagnosed in 2007 (the diagnosis was later corrected to Lewy body dementia). In June 2009, Premiere Radio Networks announced that they would no longer distribute either American Top 20 or American Top 10 after the following month. Ahead of the weekend of July 4, 2009, and with little to no advance notice, Kasem put out a press release. In it, he said he had enjoyed \\"every minute\\" of his time counting down the hits. Both shows opened with Kasem noting that his first countdown aired during July 4 weekend, then informing the audience that they would be hearing his countdown for the final time after 39 years. Both shows featured one final Long Distance Dedication from Adam, a longtime fan from Massachusetts thanking Kasem for all he had done over the years and requesting Andrew Gold's \\"Thank You for Being a Friend\\" as his song: The final Spotlight feature on AT10 focused on artists with some of the most top ten hits of the era. When the countdown on both shows reached its end, instead of telling a story about something connected with the song or the artist behind it, Kasem instead chose to use that time to offer a brief monologue on his thirty-nine year career in counting down the hits. It went as follows. With that, the trademark drumroll prior to the reveal of the number one song played one last time followed by the reveal by Kasem. \\"Second Chance\\" by Shinedown and \\"Love Story\\" by Taylor Swift were the final two chart toppers that week, with \\"Second Chance\\" spending a third consecutive week atop the AT20 chart and \\"Love Story\\" spending a fifth consecutive week atop the AT10 chart. Just before signing off for the final time, Kasem offered the following to his audience: The show then closed with Kasem reading the closing credits and then signing off for the last time, saying: References Category:American Top 40 Category:Music chart shows Category:American music radio programs Category:1998 radio programme debuts Category:2009 radio programme endings ","title":"American Top 20"},{"id":"7184571","text":"Julie Ashton-Lucy (born 29 November 1965) is an international field hockey umpire from Queensland, Australia.

He attained a high reputation as a zoologist and botanist, and his researches led the way for modern exploration of Mexican antiquities. He published the Gaceta de Literatura, and an essay titled La limite des ni√©ges perpetuelles en Volcan Popocatepetl. The natural sciences, physics, astronomy and mathematics were for him subjects that deserved great attention. He conducted several scientific experiments, and wrote numerous articles that were published in science journals. Inaugurated in 1768, his Diario literario de M√©jico [Literary Newspaper of Mexico] was suspended after only three months. He later created, in 1788, the Gaceta de Literatura [Newspaper of Literature], that was published until 1795 (115 issues). This periodical inspired many of his countrymen to follow his example. His account of Xochicalco was the first published description of these interesting ruins. More than thirty treatises on various subjects are due to his pen. Among other works, he wrote Observaciones meteorol√≥gicas [Weather observations] (1769), Observaci√≥n del paso de Venus por el disco del Sol [Observation of the passage of Venus by the disc of the Sun] (1770), Modelo y descripci√≥n de los hornos de Almad√©n [Model and description of the furnaces of Almad√©n], notes, additions and maps for the Historia Antigua de M√©xico [Ancient History of Mexico], written by Francisco Javier Clavijero, and a Mapa de la Am√©rica del Norte [Map of North America]. Astronomy, physics, meteorology, antiquities, and metallurgy, were among the topics on which he wrote, but he also devoted serious attention to certain industries. Thus the growing of silk in Mexico was the subject of several of his papers. He wrote a dissertation on the use of ammonia in combating mephitic gases in abandoned mines, and also prepared maps of New Spain (Mexico). In 1772, he published work that showed that the well-known psychedelic effects of pipiltzintzintli were due to natural causes and not the work of the devil (Memoria del uso que hacen los indios de los pipiltzintzintlis; M√©xico, D.F.: Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico).Brad Richard Huber, Alan R.

He was frequently opposed, even reviled, at home, but the French Academy of Sciences made him a corresponding member, and the viceroys of Mexico and the archbishops entrusted him with sundry scientific missions. He was a member of the Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid. He died in Mexico City in 1799. In his honor, the Sociedad Cient√≠fica Antonio Alzate [Antonio Alzate Scientific Society] was created in 1884.

It has since been passed and is similar to the ASBO scheme in the UK. The main difference is that a JLO can only be given to an underage offender (-18).  How you are given a JLO  A JLO is basically an assigned officer in a Garda district that assists in helping an underage offender not to succeed in other offences. There are many different ways that an underage person may receive one. They are mainly given out to repeated offenders of petty crimes including vandalism, underage drinking, not keeping the peace etc. If you are caught after a serious offence they are generally given out. You are normally arrested by the Garda officer that catches you offending. Your name is generally taken and your parents or guardians are contacted. A form which is filled out by the arresting officer warranting the JLO is sent to Harcourt Street Garda HQ where it  Now what?  A few weeks later the J.Lo from your district or the Garda district involved in filing the form calls to your residence where he will then talk to the parents/guardians and then yourself. If you are only a first time offender, they generally give you a warning and do not come back again (this depends on how serious the offence). But if you are a repeated offender, they are regular visitors, generally coming every 2 weeks or so and calling your residence to check up on what you have been up to. Your passport is then 'censored' which means that you cannot leave the EU until you reach the age of 18.  Law  When an underage offender reaches the age of 18, their file is wiped clean of the offences and they are no longer 'marked' men. If you are a repeated offender (normally with 4 filed offences) you may have to appear in court on the basis of a criminal conviction. This stays on your record for life.

These chemical parameters are useful, because the relative proportions of alkalis and silica play an important role in determining actual mineralogy and normative mineralogy. The classification appears to be and can be simple to use for rocks that have been chemically analyzed. Except for the following quotation from Johannsen (1937), this entry is based upon Le Maitre and others (2002). Use of the TAS classification TAS Stands for Total Alkali Silica. Before using the TAS or any other classification, however, the following words of Johannsen (1937) should be kept in mind. :Many and peculiar are the classifications that have been proposed for igneous rocks. Their variability depends in part upon the purpose for which each was intended, and in part upon the difficulties arising from the characters of the rocks themselves. The trouble is not with the classifications but with nature which did not make things right. ‚Ä¶ Rocks must be classified in order to compare them with others, previously described, of similar composition and appearance. If this cannot be done on a genetic basis, then an artificial system must answer in order to serve as a card index to rock descriptions. Although this may be an evil thing, it is, at least, the least of several evils. The subtitle of the classification chapter by Johannsen (1937) is \\"Chacun a son go√ªt\\" (to each his own taste). Furthermore, as discussed in considerable detail by Le Maitre and others (2002), the classification cannot be applied to all volcanic rocks. Certain rocks cannot be named using the diagram. For others, additional chemical, mineralogic, or textural criteria must be used, as for lamprophyres. The TAS classification should be applied only to rocks for which the mineral mode cannot be determined (otherwise, use a scheme based on mineralogy, such as the QAPF diagram or one of the other diagrams presented in the entry for igneous rocks). Before classifying rocks using the TAS diagram, the chemical analyses must be recalculated to 100% excluding water and carbon dioxide. The TAS diagram TAS Diagram. This version is based upon coordinates provided by Le Maitre et al. (2002). The names provided by Le Maitre et al. (2002) for fields in the TAS diagram are listed below. B (Basalt) (Use normative mineralogy to subdivide) O1 (Basaltic andesite) O2 (Andesite) O3 (Dacite) R (Rhyolite) T (Trachyte or Trachydacite) (Use normative mineralogy to decide) Ph (Phonolite) S1 (Trachybasalt) *Sodic and potassic variants are Hawaiite and Potassic Trachybasalt S2 (Basaltic trachyandesite) *Sodic and potassic variants are Mugearite and Shoshonite S3 (Trachyandesite *Sodic and potassic variants are Benmoreite and Latite Pc (Picrobasalt) U1 (Basanite or Tephrite) (Use normative mineralogy to decide) U2 (Phonotephrite) U3 (Tephriphonolite) F (Foidite) (Name according to dominant feldspathoid when possible. Melilitites also plot in this area and can be distinguished by additional chemical criteria.) *Sodic as used above means that Na2O - 2 is greater than K2O, and potassic that Na2O - 2 is less than K2O. Yet other names have been applied to rocks particularly rich in either sodium or potassium (as are ultrapotassic igneous rocks).

The general appearance of this arrangement is as in Fig. 1 or Fig. 3, the center view, Fig. 2, shows the cardinal feature of this trap, that it contains a collector for silt, sand, or sediment which is not, as in most other traps of the time, carried out through the valve with the efflux of water. A steam trap is a device used to discharge condensates and non-condensable gases with a negligible consumption or loss of live steam. Steam traps are nothing more than automatic valves. They open, close or modulate automatically. The three important functions of steam traps are: #Discharge condensate as soon as it is formed (unless it is desirable to use the sensible heat of the liquid condensate) #Have a negligible steam consumption (i.e. being energy efficient) #Have the capability of discharging air and other non-condensable gases. Basic operation Steam Traps operate on the difference of properties between steam and condensate. Condensate will collect at the lowest point since steam is about 1600 times greater in volume than its liquid phase. Steam properties also change with pressure, at different pressures there are different boiling points. Steam traps can be split into 3 main categories; Mechanical, Thermodynamic, and Thermostatic. These various types use the different properties of the steam to remove condensate and non-condensable gases and keep steam in the system. The vast majority of steam traps in current operation are of the mechanical operated design. Steam traps are sized for specific applications based on amount of condensate they can remove as well as other factors such as the ability to remove air and non-condensable gases. Types Steam traps can be split into three major types: # Mechanical traps These remove condensate through the use of the mechanical properties of steam vs condensate. Since liquid is denser than the steam it will travel to the bottom of the system. Mechanical traps will have a bucket or float that rises and falls in relation to condensate level and this usually has a mechanical linkage attached that opens and closes the valve. Mechanical traps operate in direct relationship to condensate levels present in the body of the steam trap. Inverted bucket and float traps are examples of mechanical traps. Float traps can have a mechanical linkage or can seal the trap through use of the float itself. # Thermostatic traps These remove condensate through the temperature difference of steam vs the liquid phase. The valve is driven through expansion and contraction of an element that is exposed to the heat from steam or condensate. These traps take a temperature drop below the saturation curve to open and remove condensate. These traps can perform this by a filled element or bellows or bimetallic element. # Thermodynamic trapsThese operate on the dynamic principals of steam vs condensate and the use of Bernoulli‚Äôs principle. When condensate released through an orifice the speed increases and a pressure drop occurs. This will flash steam to create higher pressure to close a valve (disc) or slow the discharge speed of the trap. The main types of traps in this family are; Disc, Impulse, Labyrinth, Orifice (or Venturi Nozzle). Performance Assessment of Steam Traps There are basically three methods for the performance assessment of steam traps. # Visual Method. This method basically involves visual inspection requiring good observational skills. The person assessing the trap must be able to clearly distinguish between flash steam and live steam. Sight glasses can be used for assessment. # Sound Method. The mechanisms involved in the operation of steam traps generate sounds of sonic and supersonic frequencies. Wielding proper auditory equipment along with the knowledge of Normal and abnormal sounds can help in efficient assessment of steam traps. # Temperature Method. This method is the least reliable of all the assessment methods. The low reliability of this method rests on the fact that the temperature of the condensate and saturated steam are approximately the same causing difficulties to distinguish between them on temperature basis. Some methods like cold trap are available for temperature assessment. The cold trap denotes the existence of large amount of condensates which condensed during steam trap operation. Hence required action may be taken for the same. References External links *STEAM MANUAL - \\"Steam Traps Manual\\" by V.

The island is located at . Kiger Island is south of Corvallis in southeastern Benton County, with the Linn County line following the contour of the eastern (river) side of the island. The only road to the island, SE Kiger Island Drive, is located off of Highway 99W (SW 3rd Street), just 2.5 miles south of downtown Corvallis. History In pre- settlement times the island was a summertime home for the Chepenefra (Mary's River) Kalapuya. Indian artifacts and human remains have been discovered throughout the island. In circa 1879 early Benton County pioneers Reuben Columbus Kiger, and his wife Minerva Jane (Dolly as her mother and stepfather affectionately called her), bought some land on a small island, which he and Minerva named \\"Kiger Island\\".http://www.97330.com/Minerva_Kiger- Reynold_family_history.html In 1907 Reuben died from internal injuries following an accident removing a tree stump on the farm. The Kiger farm was then passed on to Minerva Kiger. Their two sons‚ÄîJohn and Will Kiger‚Äî were not interested in being farmers, however they did live in the family owned farm house on Kiger Island. In 1922 a woodcutter discovered a mastodon tusk while collecting firewood. \\"Elephant fossils are quite common in the vicinity of Kiger Island, said Dr. Horner, director of Oregon historical research in Oregon Agricultural college.\\"Morning Oregonian November 21, 1922 page 1 Until 1964, when it was finally dismantled to make way for a more modern construction, the Kiger Island covered bridge was - at - the longest covered span in Oregon. The bridge had been in use since at least 1914, and was updated in 1934 to State Highway Commission specifications, calling for the record setting length. However, the clearance did not even reach , limiting the size of agricultural machinery and vehicles which could traverse it. In August 1963 the current bridge was built alongside the aging structure. In that same year the covering was removed from the old bridge, and in 1964 was dismantled entirely. The only evidence left of the historic span are small remnants of foundation pylons. Agriculture Kiger island has long been used for raising cattle, however it has predominantly been used for agronomy purposes. In the first half of the 20th century, (James) Grant Elgin kept a large peach orchard on the island. Oregon's 14th Governor Oswald West (a state land agent at the time) owned the Island Home hopyard on the island from 1905 to 1909.The Corvallis Times May 24, 1905 page 3 A large variety of crops have subsequently been grown including apples, peaches, cherries, strawberries, blueberries, filberts, walnuts, wheat, corn, grass seed, clover, hops, tulip bulbs, and peppermint (first planted 1995-96).

According to Gy√∂rgy Martin, a prominent folklore expert, Hungarian dances can be divided into two categories. The first refers to dances performed in the middle ages while the second relates to the 18th and 19th century. Improvisation is often mentioned as being characteristic of Hungarian dance. \\"The peasant dance is not one which is set absolutely according to rule; the dancer constructs his steps according to his mood and ingenuity.\\"Elizabeth C. Rearick (1939) Dances of the Hungarians.New York: Teachers College, Columbia University; pp. 45, 46Most important characteristics of Hungarian dance 1. They are almost always improvised. The most important stylistic feature of the dance within the Carpathians is the unusually large amount of personal improvisation. Observers have never failed to notice the individual nature of the Hungarian dance during the previous two centuries. This dancing is individual to such an extent that it is often difficult for scholars to establish the communal laws regulating individual creativity and improvising. Folk dance research has shown that this individuality is not merely poetic licence, but genuine features. Daniel Berzsenyi wrote, \\"Its secret laws are not ordered by craft. The laws are its own and enthusiasm sets the limit.\\"Gy√∂rgy Martin (1974) Hungarian Folk Dances. Gyoma: Kner Printing House, p. 15.

Gyoma: Kner Printing House, p. 16 quoted from \\"The > Killing Angel\\"; 1851 \\"...Steps, turns, movement, postures, all are arbitrary, left to the taste and genius of the dancer. The dance does not consist of regular well-defined steps ... but an individual dance inspired by an idea.\\"Karoly Viski (1937) Hungarian Dances; p. 7, quoting August Ellrich in Die Ungarn wie sie sind. Berlin, 1831 (2nd ed. 1833). \\"the men free their partners when, and for so long as, they fell inclined. Thus their hands are free and they can again take hold of their partner when they wish...\\"Karoly Viski (1937) Hungarian Dances; p. 34. \\"The brisker movements of the dance retained that peculiarity which is the feature of all Hungarian dances: the right of the dancer to improvise according to his talent and mood.\\"Karoly Viski (1937) Hungarian Dances; p. 44 Collections of the Folk Music Research Group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the national Ethnographic Museum of the State Folk Ensemble cover almost 10,000 dance variations from 700 Hungarian villages.Gy√∂rgy Martin (1974) Hungarian Folk Dances. Gyoma: Kner Printing House; p. 11. Hungarians have been noted for their \\"exceptionally well developed sense of rhythm\\". Billroth performed tests with troops stationed in Vienna and found that the Hungarian troops outperformed others in keeping time with music.Karoly Viski (1937) Hungarian Dances; p. 8 A poem published in about 1670, and probably written by a Calvinist preacher, recorded that the Hungarian dancer bends his trunk, \\"shakes his head and inclines his neck, tilts his hat over one ear, kicks like a tired horse, sticks his chest out, makes his eyes sparkle, opens his mouth now to shout \\"hejje! hujja!\\", jumps about, stamps out the rhythm, slides, swings his legs energetically, etc.\\" The poem was titled \\"A knotty stick for the purpose of straightening the backs of those striplings who in form resemble men but in dancing and capering are like goats and kids, and for describing their offensiveness when prancing\\".Karoly Viski (1937) Hungarian Dances; p. 18. The Cs√°rd√°s is undoubtedly the most popular and important dance in the Hungarian repertoire. In the 1869 book The Magyars: Their Country and Institutions Arthur Patterson wrote the following. \\"they whirl swiftly round, two or three times, and then, breaking away, recommence the pantomime as before... One seldom sees two couples performing exactly the same figure at the same time. While two separated partners are doing their step with their backs turned on one another, another couple between them are spinning round in the ecstasies of reunion.\\"Nigel Allenby Jaffe (1938: 1990) Folk Dance of Europe. Folk Dance Enterprises ; pp. 166, 167. Also featured are varied ways of holding a partner, complex changes of posture, slight crouching (lippetos), and lifting the woman in a jump and throwing her away.\\" Figures danced during the Swift Cs√°rd√°s include the lippentos-martogatos (crouching-dunking), turning in pairs, and playful alluring and releasing of the partner.Gy√∂rgy Martin (1974) Hungarian Folk Dances. Gyoma: Kner Printing House, p. 46. Half crouching, half turning figures were still being danced by the older generation in the 1970s.Gy√∂rgy Martin (1974) Hungarian Folk Dances.

Half crouching, half turning figures were still being danced by the older generation in the 1970s. While ministers of the Reformed Church consistently opposed dancing, the priests of the Catholic Church were not so severe, and in some instances even favored dancing. \\"Do the saints dance in heaven?\\", wrote a nun in the first part of the 16th century, \\"dancing will be essential there for the strong, well-built bodies of the saints\\". \\"There would have to be dancing (in heaven) for the itching soles of the Hungarian whose whole life on earth is a dancing school\\", wrote well known Catholic priest Zsigmond Csuzy in the first part of the 18th century.\\"Elizabeth C.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Lel√≥w. It lies on the Bia≈Çka river, approximately east of Czƒôstochowa and north-east of the regional capital Katowice. In the Kingdom of Poland, Lel√≥w was an important urban center of Lesser Poland, as a capital of a county which belonged to Krak√≥w Voivodeship. The village has a population of 2,127.  History  Hasidic Jews praying in the synagogue Market Square In the early days of the Kingdom of Poland, a gord was established on the Bia≈Çka river bank, in a swampy area, which gave protection from invaders. First documented mention about Lel√≥w appeared in the year 1193, in a document issued by Pope Celestine III. In 1246, during the period known as Fragmentation of Poland (see Feudal fragmentation), Prince Konrad I of Masovia initiated construction of the town, in the location of the ancient gord. In the early 14th century Lel√≥w, which by then was property of Bishops of Krak√≥w, was captured by knights of W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high. The town was manned by German and Czech troops, loyal to Bishop Jan Muskata (see also Rebellion of w√≥jt Albert). In the 14th century Lel√≥w prospered, due to royal protection and privileges. Its population reached 1,200, and King Casimir III the Great built here a castle, and surrounded the town with a defensive wall. Lel√≥w was located near the border with Czech-ruled Silesia, and as such, played an important role in the system of defence of Poland. In 1341 Lel√≥w received Magdeburg rights from King Casimir, and became a county town in Krak√≥w Voivodeship. In July 1345, during the Polish-Bohemian War, Czech units were defeated by the Poles and their Hungarian allies near Lel√≥w. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Lel√≥w remained one of the most important towns of Lesser Poland. It frequently burned, but managed to recover, and local cloth makers were famous across the country. In 1638 Lel√≥w almost completely burned in a great fire, and further destruction was brought by the Swedish-Polish war, after which the town never recovered. Lel√≥w was once again destroyed in the Great Northern War, after which its defensive wall was pulled down. After the Partitions of Poland, Lel√≥w briefly belonged to Kingdom of Prussia‚Äôs province of New Silesia (1793-1806). Since 1815, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and its decline continued. Lel√≥w County ceased to exist in 1837, and the area of the town was one of centers of January Uprising. In 1827, Lel√≥w had the population of 785, and in 1825, the ancient Saint Francis Monastery was destroyed. In 1869 Russian government reduced Lel√≥w to the status of a village. World War I did not cause any significant damage, and in the Second Polish Republic, Lel√≥w belonged to Kielce Voivodeship. On September 4, 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, the Wehrmacht invaded and burned the 14th-century St. Martin's church, together with most of the village. Further destruction took place in January 1945, when retreating German soldiers fought the advancing Red Army. The church was rebuilt after the war, but without several valuable items and ornaments. Attractions The village's main attractions include: * Catholic St. Martin's church from the 14th century, remodelled in 1638, with a sculpture of crucified Jesus saved from fire in 1939 and a Chapel of Mother of God, * Grave of Hasidic Tzadik David Biderman, visited each January by Hasidic pilgrims from all over the world,Chasydzi modlƒÖ siƒô na grobie cadyka at Rzeczpospolita, 23 January 2010 * A market square unique in Europe, with two streets joining the square in each corner, * A culinary attraction known as ciulim (a non-translatable Polish word).

Friedman attended the Happy Valley School in California. He then spent time working in circuses and as a photographer, living in France for a period. In 1962 he returned to Los Angeles, becoming a radio show producer. He also became a publicist, handling the press conferences for The Beatles around their Hollywood Bowl performance in 1964. He went on to work for the Troubadour club, becoming friendly with Stephen Stills, and helping him put together a new group, which became Buffalo Springfield. Friedman was driving the car with Stills and Richie Furay which passed on Sunset Boulevard the hearse carrying Neil Young and Bruce Palmer from Canada, a meeting which led to the formation of the band. As their de facto manager, he got the Springfield to tour with the Byrds, subsequently becoming involved in the Byrds‚Äô own work. He also started to work as a producer, with Paul Butterfield, Kaleidoscope, \\"Spider\\" John Koerner and Willie Murphy, the Holy Modal Rounders and others. Notably, he produced Nico‚Äôs album with John Cale, The Marble Index. During this time in the late-sixties, Barry Friedman also worked as an A&R; man for the record label Elektra in Los Angeles. By this time, Friedman had decided to change his name to Frazier Mohawk. Around the same time the stresses of living in the city led him, supported and funded by Elektra boss Jac Holzman, to build a studio and mountain retreat at Paxton Lodge in northern California. This was a centre for creative endeavours but, according to Holzman, relatively little usable output. Mohawk also met and married singer Sandra Hurvitz, who had previously recorded with Frank Zappa, and who now changed her name to Essra Mohawk. He subsequently produced her second album (and first as Essra Mohawk) entitled Primordial Lovers on the Reprise label, which Rolling Stone magazine in 1977 proclaimed as \\"one of the best 25 albums ever made\\" in their top 500 list of best albums. By the early 1970s, burned out by the music business, he moved to Canada, producing a few obscure acts and becoming seriously ill for a period. After his recovery he established and ran his own travelling circus for several years. Eventually he settled at Puck‚Äôs Farm north of Toronto, developing it as an attraction for families, and also including a recording studio.

Therefore the product, 47058, is primary pseudoperfect. In mathematics, and particularly in number theory, N is a primary pseudoperfect number if it satisfies the Egyptian fraction equation :\\\\frac1N + \\\\sum_{p|N}\\\\frac1p = 1, where the sum is over only the prime divisors of N.  Properties  Equivalently, N is a primary pseudoperfect number if it satisfies :1 + \\\\sum_{p|N} \\\\frac{N}p = N. Except for the primary pseudoperfect number N = 2, this expression gives a representation for N as the sum of distinct divisors of N. Therefore, each primary pseudoperfect number N (except N = 2) is also pseudoperfect. The eight known primary pseudoperfect numbers are :2, 6, 42, 1806, 47058, 2214502422, 52495396602, 8490421583559688410706771261086 . The first four of these numbers are one less than the corresponding numbers in Sylvester's sequence, but then the two sequences diverge. It is unknown whether there are infinitely many primary pseudoperfect numbers, or whether there are any odd primary pseudoperfect numbers. The prime factors of primary pseudoperfect numbers sometimes may provide solutions to Zn√°m's problem, in which all elements of the solution set are prime. For instance, the prime factors of the primary pseudoperfect number 47058 form the solution set {2,3,11,23,31} to Zn√°m's problem. However, the smaller primary pseudoperfect numbers 2, 6, 42, and 1806 do not correspond to solutions to Zn√°m's problem in this way, as their sets of prime factors violate the requirement that no number in the set can equal one plus the product of the other numbers. Anne (1998) observes that there is exactly one solution set of this type that has k primes in it, for each k ‚â§ 8, and conjectures that the same is true for larger k. If a primary pseudoperfect number N is one less than a prime number, then N√ó(N+1) is also primary pseudoperfect. For instance, 47058 is primary pseudoperfect, and 47059 is prime, so 47058 √ó 47059 = 2214502422 is also primary pseudoperfect.  History  Primary pseudoperfect numbers were first investigated and named by Butske, Jaje, and Mayernik (2000). Using computational search techniques, they proved the remarkable result that for each positive integer r up to 8, there exists exactly one primary pseudoperfect number with precisely r (distinct) prime factors, namely, the rth known primary pseudoperfect number. Those with 2 ‚â§ r ‚â§ 8, when reduced modulo 288, form the arithmetic progression 6, 42, 78, 114, 150, 186, 222, as was observed by Sondow and MacMillan (2017).

He was electrocuted on January 10, 1986, nearly a year to the day following the electrocution of his accomplice, Joseph Carl Shaw on January 11, 1985, at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia. He was executed at the age of 25 for a crime committed when he was 17 years old. On December 13, 1977, Roach pleaded guilty to two counts of murder, criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, and robbery.757 F.2d 1463. Roach v. Martin. March 20, 1985. United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He was convicted of the rape and murder of a fourteen-year-old girl and the murder of her seventeen-year- old boyfriend. Evidence presented at the trial showed that Roach was mentally handicapped, with an I.Q. between 75 and 80 and that he was probably suffering from Huntington's Chorea. Moreover, the sentencing judge found that Roach was under the influence of Shaw when the crimes were committed. Despite these mitigating factors, the sentencing judge declared that the death penalty was warranted in this case. The sentence was upheld on appeal by the South Carolina Supreme Court. Several attempts to seek review of the case or to bring a petition of habeas corpus were unsuccessful. The US Supreme Court declined to grant him certiorari. Pleas for legal reconsideration came from the United Nations,Capital punishment for minors was at the time prohibited under the ICCPR (U.S. signed 1977, ratified 1992) and American Convention on Human Rights (U.S. signed 1977, never ratified) international figures, and former president Jimmy Carter. Governor Richard Riley denied clemency. On 10 January 1986, Roach, age 25, was strapped into the electric chair and gave his last words: \\"To my family and friends, there is only three words to say: I love you.\\" He then gave a thumbs-up sign, reportedly to signal he was ready to die. He was pronounced dead at 5:16 AM. The case of James Terry Roach was brought before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which found by five votes to one that the United States Government had violated Article I (Right to Life) and Article II (right to equality before the law) of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man in executing James Terry Roach. This was the first time that the United States was found to be in violation with its human rights obligations under the said Declaration. The Murders On October 29, 1977, Roach and accomplices Joseph Carl Shaw and Ronald Eugene Mahaffey spent the morning drinking beer and doing drugs. The three then spent the early afternoon driving around in an attempt to \\"find a girl to rape,\\" according to Mahaffey.757 F.2d 1463. Roach v. Martin. March 20, 1985. United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. After pulling beside a parked car at a baseball field outside of Columbia, South Carolina, Roach aimed a .22 caliber rifle at the car's occupants, 14-year old Carlotta Hartness and 17-year old Thomas Taylor. Roach demanded they give them their money and Taylor obliged. Shaw and Mahaffey then got out of the car, took Taylor's keys, and forced Carlotta into the backseat of Shaw's car. Once back in the car, Shaw said to Roach \\"OK, now!\\" to which Roach fired the rifle into the parked car, killing Thomas Taylor.757 F.2d 1463. Roach v. Martin. March 20, 1985. United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Carlotta was then driven to a dirt road not far away where they demanded she undress. She was forced to perform oral sex on Shaw and Mahaffey and was raped repeatedly by all three. Once they were finished, Shaw then asked who would kill her. Roach volunteered to be the one to shoot the girl. Shaw ordered Carlotta to lay face down on the ground, to which she initially refused and pled with them to spare her life. Eventually giving in to their demands, she put her face to the ground, and Roach shot her several times in the head. Shaw shot her in the head once more, then buried the rifle, bullets, and wallet they had stolen from Taylor earlier. The three then returned to the baseball field to confirm that Taylor was dead.757 F.2d 1463. Roach v. Martin. March 20, 1985. United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

The exposure range of a device is usually expressed in stops, which are equivalent to \\\\log_{2} (c) where c is the medium or device's contrast ratio. For example, average Digital Video (DV) has a contrast ratio of 45:1, so its exposure range is roughly 5.5 stops. Film has an exposure range of approximately 14 stops. Exposure is usually controlled by changing the lens aperture (the amount of light it gathers), the shutter speed (how long light is gathered) or sensitivity (how strongly the film or sensor responds to light). Changing exposure does not change the exposure range. Three exposures of the same image at different exposure levels. Note that some details present in the darkest image are not present in the lightest image, and vice versa. A graduated neutral density filter can be also used to improve the reproduction of the exposure range of the scene, by darkening bright parts of the image. A graduated filter will reduce the extreme highlights of an image, such as a clear, open sky as well as sunlight. The filter is usually an even gradation of neutral gray to clear, covering the top third to half of the filter in gray. Therefore, it mostly affects the top third to half of the frame's exposure, leaving the highlights in the bottom half to two-thirds unaffected. Often these filters are the square gelatin, polycarbonate, or glass type. A mounting kit such as a square frame receptacle mounted to interchangeable screw-in rings will hold the filter at an appropriate orientation. These can be mounted to the end of an SLR lens camera in the same fashion as a polarizing lens, UV filter, and various other screw-in type filters for SLR and DSLR cameras.

The work has been credited as an influence on modern libertarian thought and on part of the New Right. Summary Rothbard advocates anarcho-capitalism, a strain of stateless libertarianism. Rothbard traces the intellectual origins of libertarianism back to classical liberal philosophers John Locke and Adam Smith and the American Revolution. He argues that modern libertarianism originated not as a response to socialism or leftism, but to conservatism. Rothbard views the right of self-ownership and the right to homestead as establishing the complete set of principles of the libertarian system. The core of libertarianism, writes Rothbard, is the non-aggression axiom: \\"that no man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else.\\" He points out that while this principle is almost universally applied to private individuals and institutions, the government is considered above the general moral law, and therefore does not have to abide by this axiom. Rothbard attempts to dispel the notion that libertarianism constitutes a sect or offshoot of liberalism or conservatism, or that its seemingly right-wing opinions on economic policy and left-wing opinions on social and foreign policy are contradictory. Reception The Objectivist author Peter Schwartz criticized the views Rothbard expounded in For a New Liberty, writing that like other libertarians, Rothbard cared about neither \\"the pursuit of freedom nor the exercise of reason\\" and supported only \\"the extermination of government and the inculcation of anti-state hostility.\\" Schwartz maintained that Rothbard wrongly viewed the state as \\"by nature criminal.\\" Libertarian author Tom G. Palmer commented in 1997 that For a New Liberty \\"provides a good overview of the libertarian worldview, although the chapters on public policy issues and on the organized libertarian movement are by now somewhat dated.\\" Libertarian author David Boaz writes that For a New Liberty, together with Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974) and Ayn Rand's essays on political philosophy, \\"defined the 'hard-core' version of modern libertarianism, which essentially restated Spencer's law of equal freedom: Individuals have the right to do whatever they want to do, so long as they respect the equal rights of others.\\" British philosopher Ted Honderich writes that Rothbard's anarcho-libertarianism informed \\"one messianic part of the New Right\\". In Radicals for Capitalism (2007), journalist Brian Doherty writes of For a New Liberty, \\"This book strove to synthesize, in condensed form, the economic, historical, philosophical, and policy elements of Rothbard's vision...the book was meant as both a primer and a manifesto, so Rothbard crammed in as much of his overall theory of liberty as he could ... Rothbard hits the harder anarcho-capitalist stuff, but slips it in so smoothly that many readers might not notice that this 'libertarian manifesto' promotes anarchism.\\" Publishing history In 2006 the Ludwig von Mises Institute released a new hardbound edition, with a new introduction by Lew Rockwell. ;English * Ludwig von Mises Institute. 2006.

Bodelsen prefers the social-realistic style of writing, often thrillers about middle-class people who face the consequences of materialism, which often clashes with their human values. His thrillers also experiment with ordinary persons tempted by e.g. theft and border-morale issues. Most famous is his ingenious novel Think of a Number (T√¶nk p√• et tal, 1968) filmed as The Silent Partner in 1978. Also widely known is his cooperation with Danish National Television (Danmarks Radio) on the filming of some of his children's thrillers, e.g. Guldregn (\\"Golden Shower\\", 1986).

Plot Mike (John Moulder Brown), a 15-year-old school leaver, finds a job in a public bath. There he is trained by his co-worker Susan (Jane Asher), a woman ten years his senior. Susan is a tease who plays with Mike's and other men's feelings, acting sometimes warm and affectionate and other times cold and distant. Working in the bathhouse turns out to involve providing services to clients of a more or less sexual nature, in exchange for a tip. For example, an older woman (Diana Dors) is sexually stimulated by pushing Mike's head into her bosom and talking suggestively about football. Mike is confused by this and at first does not want to accept the tip he gets, but Susan tells him that these services are a normal practice, including exchange of her female clients for his male clients whenever a client prefers the opposite sex. Mike fantasizes about Susan and falls in love with her, even though she has a wealthy and handsome young fianc√©, Chris (Chris Sandford). Mike also discovers that Susan is cheating on her fianc√© with an older, married man (Karl Michael Vogler) who was Mike's physical education teacher and works at the baths as a swimming instructor for teenage girls, touching them inappropriately. Mike begins following Susan on her dates with Chris and the instructor and trying to disrupt them. Although Susan often gets angry at Mike for this, she provides just enough encouragement to cause him to continue the behavior. Mike's infatuation with Susan continues despite his friends mocking him, his mother being treated rudely by Susan, his bicycle being destroyed by Susan, and his activities drawing the ire of Susan's boyfriends, local police, and Mike's boss at work. Obsessed with Susan, Mike refuses other outlets for sex, such as his former girlfriend and a prostitute who offers him a discount. While following Susan on a date, Mike sees and steals a life-size advertising photo cutout of a naked girl who resembles Susan. He confronts Susan with it on the London Underground, flying into a violent tantrum in front of other passengers when Susan teasingly refuses to tell him whether she posed for the nude photo. Mike then takes the cutout to the deserted baths after hours and swims naked with it, embracing it. The next morning, Mike disrupts the instructor's foot race and punctures the tyres of the instructor's car while Susan is driving it. Susan gets mad and hits Mike, in the process losing the diamond from her new engagement ring in the snow. Anxious to find the lost diamond, Mike and Susan collect the surrounding snow in plastic bags and take it back to the closed baths to melt it, using a lowered ceiling lamp outlet to heat an electric kettle in the empty pool. While Susan is briefly out of the room, Mike finds the diamond in the melted snow, and lies down naked in the dry pool with the diamond on his tongue. He teases Susan by refusing to give her the diamond until she undresses. She does so, he gives her the diamond and she is about to leave, but she reconsiders and lies down next to him. They have a sexual encounter, although it is not clear whether Mike is able to perform. Chris then telephones and Susan rushes around the empty pool hurriedly gathering her clothes to go and meet him. Mike begs her to stay and talk to him, but Susan insists she has to leave. Meanwhile an attendant has arrived, who, unaware of the presence of Mike and Susan, opens the valve to start filling the dry pool with water. Mike becomes more insistent, chasing Susan around the rapidly filling pool, and finally hitting her in the head with the ceiling lamp, severely injuring her. She falls (along with a tin of red paint that resembles blood) into the water of the pool. Mike embraces the dying, nude Susan underwater, just as he embraced the photo cutout.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 23. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Judging from 'Deep End,' Skolimowski has a fairly distinctive film personality, but it happens to be a split personality, split in a way‚Äîhalf-Truffaut, half-Polanski‚Äîthat I find rather diconcerting and unappealing. Imagine a film like 'Stolen Kisses' turning, at about the half-way point, into a film like 'Repulsion' and you have 'Deep End.'\\"Arnold, Gary (September 23, 1971). \\"Skolimowski's 'Deep End'\\". The Washington Post. C1. Nigel Andrews of The Monthly Film Bulletin called it \\"a study in the growth of obsession that is both funny and frighteningly exact.\\" In an interview with NME in 1982, David Lynch said of Deep End, \\"I don't like colour movies and I can hardly think about colour. It really cheapens things for me and there's never been a colour movie I've freaked out over except one, this thing called Deep End, which had really great art direction.\\"1982 NME interview with David Lynch http://www.davidlynch.de/nmelynch.html The film has a score of 85% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.42/10.

She was also an educator, social worker, and social reformer in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and an independence activist in British India. She was Jawaharlal Nehru's sister-in-law and Indira Gandhi's maternal aunt. Personal life Sheila Kaul was born in 1915. She had a degree in arts from the Lahore College for Women and a degree in teaching from the Sir Ganga Ram Training College, Lahore. She was a state badminton champion in undivided Punjab, British India. She was married to Kailas Nath Kaul, brother of Kamala Nehru and a renowned botanist who established the National Botanical Research Institute in Lucknow, India. Gautam Kaul, a former Director General of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and film critic, and Vikram Kaul, an international sports administrator, are their sons. Deepa Kaul, a social worker and former Congress minister, is their daughter. Jawaharlal Nehru was Sheila Kaul's brother-in-law, Indira Gandhi was her niece, and Rajiv Gandhi was her grandnephew. Prem Adib, a 1940s Bollywood superstar, was her brother-in-law. Political career Sheila Kaul was Corporator of the Lucknow Municipal Corporation during 1959‚Äì65, and a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council during 1968‚Äì71. She was elected as Member of Parliament five times ‚Äì in 1971, 1980 and 1984 from Lucknow, and in 1989 and 1991 from Rae Bareli. She served as a Minister in the Cabinet of India during 1980‚Äì84 and 1991‚Äì95, and as the Governor of Himachal Pradesh during 1995‚Äì96. Kaul led the Indian delegations to the International Women's Congress, Berlin in 1975, the International Conference of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, Copenhagen in 1980, the International Conference on the Role of Culture for Development of Man and Society, Sofia in 1980, the Sessions of General Conference of the UNESCO, Paris in 1982 and 1983, the First Conference of Ministers of Education and Culture of the Non-Aligned and Other Developing Countries, Pyongyang in 1983, the International Conference on Education, Geneva in 1984, the United Nations General Assembly in 1985 and 1987, and the European Parliament in 1990. She became General Secretary of the All India Congress Committee in 1988. Kaul introduced in the Parliament of India The Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1991, which was enacted in 1992.http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/lsdeb/ls10/ses5/23011292.htm She also moved in Parliament the AMU (Amendment) Bill, 1981, which was enacted in the same year. While in Parliament, she served as a member of the Committee on Public Undertakings (1980‚Äì84), Committee on Privileges (1980‚Äì84), Joint Committee on Taxation (Amendment) Bill (1980‚Äì84), Consultative Committee, Ministry of Civil Aviation (1990), and Subject Committee on Science and Technology (1990). A chargesheet based on a case of 1996 accused the former Union Urban Development Minister of entering into a conspiracy with her two personal staff members and over forty other individuals for allegedly renting out government shops for a consideration.The Hindu : Sheila Kaul chargesheeted The CBI, however, did not seize any assets disproportionate to her income, implying that there was no evidence of corruption.President's comments send corruption cases back to cold storage Without holding a trial or providing Kaul with an opportunity to defend herself, http://www.docstoc.com/docs/47549596/JUDICIAL-ACTIVISM-Justice-Mr-V-G- Palshikar-(Retd) the Supreme Court of India in 1996 imposed an exemplary fine of ‚Çπ 6 million on Kaul for having nepotistically rented out 52 shops and kiosks under the discretionary quota. In 2002, the fine was quashed by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court of India in response to a review petition filed by Kaul. Kaul, the accused, had been deprived of her right to a trial in a Sessions Court, and also the right to file an appeal against a conviction order, if any, before the High Court and ultimately before the Supreme Court. In 2013, the 99-year-old Kaul moved the Supreme Court of India, challenging the 2012 order of a CBI Special Judge that asked her to appear in court in an ambulance to respond to the charges of out-of-turn allotments against her. Kaul's counsel contended that she was incapable of giving rational answers or making a personal appearance due to her old age and ailments. They argued that the High Court had earlier dismissed Kaul's relief plea despite a medical board of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences reporting in 2012 that she had an \\"impaired\\" understanding of day-to-day events. In 2016, a year after Kaul's death, a special court awarded a two-year prison sentence to her former additional private secretary Rajan Lala, a retired government official, for his role in an allotment scam during her ministerial tenure.

Unlike a true roller coaster, the train is powered through the entire course, rather than being allowed to coast after an initial lift or launch. This allows for both compact layouts that start out with curving hills, or long, extended layouts that would need too many lifts to be feasible. The most common manufacturers of powered coasters are Mack, Wisdom Rides, and Zamperla. Due to the family-oriented nature of the rides, height restrictions can be as little as 36 inches or taller for someone to ride. The most common model of powered coasters is the Zamperla Dragon coasters (also called \\"Dragon Wagons,\\" although there are non-powered versions of these coasters). Other installations include Casey Junior, Le Petit Train du Cirque at Disneyland Park (Paris) (built by Vekoma), Thunder Run at Canada's Wonderland, Runaway Mine Train at Alton Towers and High in the Sky Seuss Trolley Train Ride at Islands of Adventure. The train on a powered coaster usually picks up electricity from contacts in the rails (similar to an electric locomotive or a monorail) and may contain multiple motors. Some powered coasters are powered by a flexible cable connected to the train. Another component of powered coasters is an extra \\"track\\" in the center of the rails. This allows the tyres attached to the motor to \\"grip\\" the track and propel the train forward. A powered coaster generally runs a single train and may traverse the circuit multiple times before stopping at the station. In Genting highlands, The Flying Dragon is the world's longest powered roller coaster in terms of ride length but has been demolished.

He was a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and education Wyatt was born in Louisville and attended the University of Louisville and the University of Louisville School of Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1927. He was the principal counsel for The Louisville Courier-Journal and other Bingham family- owned media companies prior to launching his political career.  Career   Early career  Wyatt's political career began with his election as the mayor of Louisville in 1941. He took office just after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Wyatt made civil defense a priority in his city and also initiated Louisville's planning and zoning commission.  Politics and diplomacy  At the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Wyatt was called upon advise U.S. Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky, who was scheduled to give the nomination speech for U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Barkley at first said he would not make the speech after FDR passed him up for the vice- presidential recommendation in favor of Harry S. Truman of Missouri. James A. Farley, FDR's former Postmaster General and Barkley confidant, agreed with Wyatt and insisted that Barkley give what is recalled as a particularly effective oration on Roosevelt's behalf.David M. Jordan, FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944, Blomington: Indiana University Press, 2011, pp. 165, 167, As Wyatt's term as mayor of Louisville ended, President Truman, who in 1948 did tap Barkley as his vice-presidential choice, appointed Wyatt as United States Housing Expediter for the Office of War Mobilization, a position given Cabinet-level rank. With Eleanor Roosevelt, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Hubert Humphrey, and others, Wyatt took a leading role in the founding and leadership of the interest group, Americans for Democratic Action. He was the first ADA chairman of the group in 1947. Wyatt was campaign manager for Adlai Stevenson's 1952 presidential campaign and played a prominent role in Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign. Both ended in losses to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1959, Wyatt planned to run for governor of Kentucky. Instead, he ran for lieutenant governor with Bert T. Combs at the top of the ticket. Combs and Wyatt were both elected and served in those offices from 1959 through 1963. Combs' administration created the Kentucky Economic Development Commission, with Wyatt as its chairman. In 1962, Wyatt was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for the United States Senate but lost the election to the moderate Republican incumbent, Thruston B. Morton. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy appointed Wyatt as a special envoy to Indonesia.Stars and Stripes May 31, 1963 Wyatt's mission was successful and Sukarno did not take over foreign- owned elements of the Indonesian oil industry, as had occurred in Mexico in 1938. Return to law After leaving the lieutenant governor's office in 1963, Wyatt returned to the law firm which he had co-founded in the late 1940s. Originally known as Wyatt, Grafton & Grafton, the firm had changed name partners when Wyatt became lieutenant governor. The Grafton brothers, Cornelius (\\"Chip\\"), father of noted mystery novelist, Sue Grafton, and Arthur had formed the firm with Wyatt. Chip Grafton's practice was heavily oriented to representation of municipal bond issuers. Wyatt's position as lieutenant governor presented a conflict of interest for the law firm. As a result, Chip left the firm and instead formed Harper, Ferguson, Grafton & Fleischer. The Wyatt firm became known as Wyatt, Grafton & Sloss, with partner Robert L. Sloss elevated to name status. After completing his term as governor, Combs was appointed a federal appellate judge. He resigned this position to seek another term as governor in 1971, but he was defeated in the Democratic primary by his former executive secretary Wendell H. Ford. Combs then resumed the practice of law with the old line Louisville firm of Bullitt, Dawson and Tarrant, which was renamed Tarrant, Combs & Bullitt. In the early 1980s, after Wyatt's retirement, Gordon Davidson, the managing partner of the Wyatt firm, and Combs engineered the merger of the two firms, forming Kentucky's largest law firm, Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs. Vice President Hubert Humphrey had Wyatt play an important role at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, again in Chicago. Wyatt, who twenty-four years earlier had soothed the hurt feelings of Alben Barkley, then devised a compromise over the party's platform plank in regard to the lingering Vietnam War. For the remainder of his life, Wyatt was active in the legal community and with civic affairs in Kentucky. He and his wife, Anne, donated $500,000 to the Jefferson County public schools to create scholarships for high school debaters, and another $500,000 to the law school at the University of Louisville, where he had once served as chairman of the trustees. The university in 1995 named its law school building after Wyatt. He served a term as chairman of the board of trustees at Bellarmine University; a sizeable donation from the Wyatts funds a lecture series at the school.  Death  Wyatt died in 1996; he is interred in Section 33, Lot 13 of Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

Personal details Kulas was born in Oakville, Ontario, Canada on January 27, 1969. His family relocated to Lakefield, Ontario in the early 1980s where he attended the prestigious Lakefield College School from 1982 to 1987. He is married to Canadian actress Katie Griffin with whom he has two sons named Jett and Wyatt. Music career Although part of many independent Toronto music projects in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was not until 1995 that his professional career began to take off. Having been granted the FACTOR New Talent Demo Award for music that year and being runner up in the Toronto radio station Q107's Scott Liddle Songwriters Award, Kulas also released his first solo studio album titled Mosquito. Produced by Saul Davies, multi-instrumentalist with the British rock band James, it went on to be hailed as one of Canada's \\"top 20 independent albums\\" of 1995/1996 by Chart magazine. The album would also gain the attention of James front man Tim Booth who midway through 1996 and at the behest of producer Brian Eno was considering filling the vocal void created when guitarist and backing vocalist Larry Gott departed in 1995. In January 1997 Kulas was invited by James to New York as a backing vocalist and multi-instrumentalist to test the waters with a handful of American shows and an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman. The ad-hoc \\"audition\\" would prove to be a success and garner an invitation for Kulas to join the band in the UK for what would turn out to be a five-year period. In performing with James, Kulas was a singer and multi-instrumentalist on 4 Top 40 albums including Whiplash, the number one The Best Of, Millionaires and Pleased To Meet You. In that time he and the band toured extensively in Asia, South Africa, Europe and North America, including the Lollapalooza Festival and Glastonbury Festival in 1997. In the UK, James continued to perform sold out Arena Tours including Wembley and Manchester Evening News Arena and also played to a live TV audience of 500 million as the torch was passed from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. After a decision by singer Booth to leave James to pursue other interests in December 2001 saw the band informally break up, Kulas returned home to Canada to pick up where he left his solo career years before. In 2002 he completed his second, self-produced solo album titled Another Small Machine while performing many live shows across Canada. In keeping with his passion for film, Kulas also went on to compose and perform music for the film Jade Love which won the 2004 Best Short Documentary at the Reel Film Festival in Toronto as well as composing original music for the Park Bench feature film The Death Of Alice Blue in 2006. His composing skills have also seen him cross over to writing music for television. In that same year Kulas wrote and produced the theme song for the Marathon animated series Team Galaxy on The Cartoon Network as well as producing full-length albums for artists Katie Griffin and Stephanie Belding. His first EP titled Imperial Cheerleader was released in December 2006 exclusively through Apple iTunes. In January 2007, after a six-year absence, James re-formed, this time with the original band member line up from the 1992 album Seven. While performing in Toronto to promote their 10th studio album, Hey Ma, in September 2008, Kulas joined the band on stage for a selection of songs that included \\"Just Like Fred Astaire\\", \\"Five-O\\" and \\"Destiny Calling\\".

Random dynamical systems are characterized by a state space S, a set of maps \\\\Gamma from S into itself that can be thought of as the set of all possible equations of motion, and a probability distribution Q on the set \\\\Gamma that represents the random choice of map. Motion in a random dynamical system can be informally thought of as a state X \\\\in S evolving according to a succession of maps randomly chosen according to the distribution Q. An example of a random dynamical system is a stochastic differential equation; in this case the distribution Q is typically determined by noise terms. It consists of a base flow, the \\"noise\\", and a cocycle dynamical system on the \\"physical\\" phase space. Another example is discrete state random dynamical system; some elementary contradistinctions between Markov chain and random dynamical system descriptions of a stochastic dynamics are discussed. Motivation 1: Solutions to a stochastic differential equation Let f : \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} be a d-dimensional vector field, and let \\\\varepsilon > 0. Suppose that the solution X(t, \\\\omega; x_{0}) to the stochastic differential equation :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathrm{d} X = f(X) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t + \\\\varepsilon \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} W (t); \\\\\\\\\\\\ X (0) = x_{0}; \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. exists for all positive time and some (small) interval of negative time dependent upon \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, where W : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} denotes a d-dimensional Wiener process (Brownian motion). Implicitly, this statement uses the classical Wiener probability space :(\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}) := \\\\left( C_{0} (\\\\mathbb{R}; \\\\mathbb{R}^{d}), \\\\mathcal{B} (C_{0} (\\\\mathbb{R}; \\\\mathbb{R}^{d})), \\\\gamma \\\\right). In this context, the Wiener process is the coordinate process. Now define a flow map or (solution operator) \\\\varphi : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{d} by :\\\\varphi (t, \\\\omega, x_{0}) := X(t, \\\\omega; x_{0}) (whenever the right hand side is well-defined). Then \\\\varphi (or, more precisely, the pair (\\\\mathbb{R}^{d}, \\\\varphi)) is a (local, left-sided) random dynamical system. The process of generating a \\"flow\\" from the solution to a stochastic differential equation leads us to study suitably defined \\"flows\\" on their own. These \\"flows\\" are random dynamical systems.  Motivation 2: Connection to Markov Chain  An i.i.d random dynamical system in the discrete space is described by a triplet (S, \\\\Gamma, Q). * S is the state space, \\\\\\\\{s_1, s_2,\\\\cdots, s_n\\\\\\\\}. * \\\\Gamma is a family of maps of S\\\\rightarrow S. Each such map has a n\\\\times n matrix representation, called deterministic transition matrix. It is a binary matrix but it has exactly one entry 1 in each row and 0s otherwise. * Q is the probability measure of the \\\\sigma-field of \\\\Gamma. The discrete random dynamical system comes as follows, # The system is in some state x_0 in S, a map \\\\alpha_1 in \\\\Gamma is chosen according to the probability measure Q and the system moves to the state x_1=\\\\alpha_1(x_0) in step 1. # Independently of previous maps, another map \\\\alpha_2 is chosen according to the probability measure Q and the system moves to the state x_2=\\\\alpha_2(x_1). # The procedure repeats. The random variable X_n is constructed by means of composition of independent random maps, X_n=\\\\alpha_n\\\\circ \\\\alpha_{n-1}\\\\circ \\\\dots \\\\circ \\\\alpha_1(X_0). Clearly, X_n is a Markov Chain. Reversely, can, and how, a given MC be represented by the compositions of i.i.d. random transformations? Yes, it can, but not unique. The proof for existence is similar with Birkhoff‚Äìvon Neumann theorem for doubly stochastic matrix. Here is an example that illustrates the existence and non-uniqueness. Example: If the state space S=\\\\\\\\{1, 2\\\\\\\\} and the set of the transformations \\\\Gamma expressed in terms of deterministic transition matrices. Then a Markov transition matrix M =\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0.4 & 0.6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.7 & 0.3 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) can be represented by the following decomposition by the min-max algorithm, M =0.6\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right)+0.3 \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right)+ 0.1\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right). In the meantime, another decomposition could be M = 0.18 \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right)+ 0.28\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) +0.42\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right)+0.12\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{array}\\\\right). Formal definition Formally, a random dynamical system consists of a base flow, the \\"noise\\", and a cocycle dynamical system on the \\"physical\\" phase space. In detail. Let (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}) be a probability space, the noise space. Define the base flow \\\\vartheta : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega as follows: for each \\"time\\" s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, let \\\\vartheta_{s} : \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega be a measure-preserving measurable function: :\\\\mathbb{P} (E) = \\\\mathbb{P} (\\\\vartheta_{s}^{-1} (E)) for all E \\\\in \\\\mathcal{F} and s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}; Suppose also that # \\\\vartheta_{0} = \\\\mathrm{id}_{\\\\Omega} : \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega, the identity function on \\\\Omega; # for all s, t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, \\\\vartheta_{s} \\\\circ \\\\vartheta_{t} = \\\\vartheta_{s + t}. That is, \\\\vartheta_{s}, s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}, forms a group of measure- preserving transformation of the noise (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}). For one-sided random dynamical systems, one would consider only positive indices s; for discrete-time random dynamical systems, one would consider only integer-valued s; in these cases, the maps \\\\vartheta_{s} would only form a commutative monoid instead of a group. While true in most applications, it is not usually part of the formal definition of a random dynamical system to require that the measure-preserving dynamical system (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}, \\\\vartheta) is ergodic. Now let (X, d) be a complete separable metric space, the phase space. Let \\\\varphi : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\times X \\\\to X be a (\\\\mathcal{B} (\\\\mathbb{R}) \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{B} (X), \\\\mathcal{B} (X))-measurable function such that # for all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, \\\\varphi (0, \\\\omega) = \\\\mathrm{id}_{X} : X \\\\to X, the identity function on X; # for (almost) all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, (t, \\\\omega, x) \\\\mapsto \\\\varphi (t, \\\\omega,x) is continuous in both t and x; # \\\\varphi satisfies the (crude) cocycle property: for almost all \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega, ::\\\\varphi (t, \\\\vartheta_{s} (\\\\omega)) \\\\circ \\\\varphi (s, \\\\omega) = \\\\varphi (t + s, \\\\omega). In the case of random dynamical systems driven by a Wiener process W : \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to X, the base flow \\\\vartheta_{s} : \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\Omega would be given by :W (t, \\\\vartheta_{s} (\\\\omega)) = W (t + s, \\\\omega) - W(s, \\\\omega). This can be read as saying that \\\\vartheta_{s} \\"starts the noise at time s instead of time 0\\". Thus, the cocycle property can be read as saying that evolving the initial condition x_{0} with some noise \\\\omega for s seconds and then through t seconds with the same noise (as started from the s seconds mark) gives the same result as evolving x_{0} through (t + s) seconds with that same noise. Attractors for random dynamical systems The notion of an attractor for a random dynamical system is not as straightforward to define as in the deterministic case. For technical reasons, it is necessary to \\"rewind time\\", as in the definition of a pullback attractor. Moreover, the attractor is dependent upon the realisation \\\\omega of the noise.

It aired on Fox in the United States on November 5, 2006, and is written by Rick Wiener, Kenny Schwartz and Nahnatchka Khan and directed by Brent Woods. In the episode, Stan wants to speak at the Republican National Convention, but the only GOP group that wants him to speak is the gay contingent. Plot Stan is not selected by his local chapter of the Conservative Republicans to speak at the Republican National Convention. After watching a pretentious surrealist play about Abraham Lincoln, he decides to write and perform his own play about the first Republican president, to return to the original values of the Republican party. Stan's play, a one-man show entitled Lincoln Lover, depicts a very close relationship between Lincoln and his most trusted guard, Captain David Derickson. The play becomes extremely successful as many gay men come to watch, though Stan (who wrote the play based on Derickson's notes) apparently does not notice the homosexual undertones of his play. The Log Cabin Republicans invite him to speak at the convention; however, it is not until during the LCR party that Stan realizes its members are gay. He is won over by an elaborate musical number (\\"We're Red and We're Gay\\") and begins acting more and more like a stereotypical homosexual male. Greg, who is gay and lives across the road from Stan, is a member of the LCR. Terry, his partner, a Democrat, is not. This causes them to break up. Steve, who has been deeply indoctrinated by Stan in the belief that all gays are evil, tries to save Stan, and reveals to the LCR Stan's previous anti-gay activities (such as participating in and funding the \\"7th Annual Anti-Gay Palooza\\" with Pat Robertson). Stan is uninvited from an LCR cruise and not allowed to speak on their behalf at the RNC because he is perceived as homophobic, so he decides to sleep with a man to show \\"the LCR...I'm one of them.\\" He goes on a date with Terry (who is mad at Greg and has declared \\"open season\\"), but fails to become aroused when they reach the bedroom. Terry tells Stan that homosexuality is not a choice, contrary to Stan's belief. At the RNC, when the Conservative Republicans' speaker is kicked out for her second car being a Toyota Prius, Stan speaks for the Republicans. When he sees the Log Cabin members not being let in, Stan states in his speech, with much surprise to the convention, that they are not gay by choice, but nevertheless are Republicans by choice and that all Republicans should band together to direct their hatred from the gays to the Democrats, who choose to be that way. Afterwards, the Conservative Republicans accept the LCR. Reception The episode was nominated for Outstanding Individual Episode by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation at the 18th GLAAD Media Awards. The award is meant to recognize and honor various branches of the media for their outstanding representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community and issues. The episode was watched by a total of 7.71 million people; this made it the third most-watched show on Animation Domination that night, losing to Family Guy and The Simpsons, which had 10.46 million viewers.

It serves approximately 900 students, grades 9 through 12, from Bracebridge and surrounding areas in Muskoka; attached to it is the Bracebridge Sportsplex and the Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre. BMLSS is one of seven secondary schools in the Trillium Lakelands District School Board, and is one of only two high schools in Bracebridge; the other is St. Dominic Catholic Secondary School. Location BMLSS is located at 100 Clearbrook Trail, Bracebridge, Ontario, in the same building as the Bracebridge Sportsplex and the Rene M. Caisse Memorial Theatre. The facility completed construction in August 2007; and was opened the following month..The theatre is open to all students, and is used regularly by the dramatic arts classes. Much of the Sportsplex is available for use in phys ed. classes. The facility was opened to replace the old high school, located in town, built in the early 1920s, as well as the old Bracebridge Culture and Recreation centre (the \\"Centennial Centre\\"), which was over 30 years old. The original high school was remodeled for residential use, while the Culture and Recreation centre was remodeled and became a Georgian College campus for Muskoka. Special programs BMLSS offers an Advanced Placement (AP) program, which allows students to potentially bypass a first-year credit in University; the school is one of only two in the district to offer this program. Grade 12 courses offering this include Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Functions, French, and English. BMLSS also offers regular exchange programs to various countries around the world; the student may choose from one-month, three-month, or year- long exchanges. The school also offers the Specialist High Skills Major program in construction, communications and technology and in health & wellness. Teams and Clubs BMLSS has been widely known for sports; in 2006, two senior female soccer players were asked to play for a Toronto team. One of them has now been asked to try out for the Canadian Girls National Soccer Team. In 2007, BMLSS Native Alex Watson was accepted onto the Canadian U-17 Rugby Team. In 2008, Students, Curtis Lauzon and Thomas Edwards were accepted onto the Ontario U-15 Rugby Team. Teams and groups include: fencing, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, hockey, curling, badminton, rugby, lacrosse, cross- country, track and field, nordic skiing, field hockey, swimming, and volleyball. Other clubs at BMLSS include their improv teams, chess club, Concert Band, Stage Band, Outers Club, the Mountain Bike Club, Horticultural Club, and Reach Team, Fencing, Robotics, Character Education, Lakers Leadership Council, and Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) Club. All of the sporting teams both have Senior and Junior divisions separated by gender. BMLSS is also the high school for local musician Kasandra Cutting, who often plays on the local radio, Moose FM. Lakers Leadership Council In 2014 BMLSS retired the student parliament (SPAR) and replaced it with Lakers Leadership Council (LLC). The first year running the council was split into four divisions: social, academics, recreation, and communications. Each division had two co- chairs who ran members for their respective division. The following year they replaced that structure with one communal division and two co-chairs and one student administrator. LLC runs many events on campus including coffee houses, school dances, Relay For Life, Summerfest, Winterfest, spirit days, and many more. The LLC office is on the second floor overlooking Main St. and the Island.

He was the Member of Parliament for Finsbury from 1945 to 1950. Early life Born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1906 to John Mills, a prosperous businessman, and Elizabeth Platts, a doctor, Platts-Mills was educated at Nelson College from 1919 to 1924.Nelson College Old Boys' Register, 1856‚Äì2006, 6th edition He graduated with a first- class honours degree in law from Victoria University College and in 1928 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. At one time identifying with the conservative English Mistery group, the Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact permanently altered his political outlook.Stephen Sedley \\"In Judges‚Äô Lodgings\\", London Review of Books, 11 November 1999 Career After graduating he was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in 1932, then worked as a barrister in London, and in 1936 joined the Labour Party. On the outbreak of the Second World War he joined the Royal Air Force. However he was later told to leave, and it was suspected that this was due to his communist sympathies. Once the Soviet Union entered the war, the military was more enthusiastic about his involvement. During the later part of the war, Platts-Mills volunteered to work as a miner, and at the 1945 general election he was elected as the Labour MP for Finsbury. In the Commons, Platts-Mills emerged as one of a small number of MPs with pro- Soviet sympathies. Platts-Mills' opposition to NATO and his claim that the United States had too much power in Europe brought him into conflict with the leadership of the Labour Party. In April 1948, Platts-Mills organised a petition in support of Pietro Nenni and the Italian Socialist Party in its general election campaign. Controversial because Nenni was in alliance with the Italian Communist Party, this action became the foundation of the Labour Independent Group. He gained support from other MPs including Konni Zilliacus, D. N. Pritt, Geoffrey Bing and William Warbey. This went against government policy. Platts-Mills was expelled from the Labour Party, and, standing as an independent, he lost his seat in the 1950 general election. He returned to his legal career and established himself as one of Britain's leading barristers. He was made a QC in 1964,Obituary, Daily Telegraph, 27 October 2001 and readmitted to the Labour Party in 1969.Lena Jeger Obituary, The Guardian, 27 October 2001 \\"A master of courtroom theatre.. [whose] clashes with the Bench entered into legal legend\\", Platts-Mills was defence counsel to many clients, including the Great Train Robbers and the Kray twins. Platts-Mills died on 26 October 2001. Personal life In 1936, he married Janet Cree. He was the father of a forester Tim Platts-Mills, a Lonrho director Jonathan Platts- Mills, Thomas Platts-Mills, Barney Platts-Mills, a wood sculptor Benjamin Platts-Mills and Mark Platts-Mills QC.

Starring Shin Hyun-joon, Won Bin, Shin Ha-kyun, Jung Jae-young and Jung Jin- young, the black comedy is about a group of four assassins-for-hire, with a dogged prosecutor on their trail. Plot In the middle of downtown Seoul, mysterious bombings and murders are taking place. Four men leave a crime scene, skillfully evading the police. This eccentric band of killers consists of team leader Sang-yeon (Shin Hyun-joon), bomb specialist Jung-woo (Shin Ha- kyun), sniper Jae-young (Jung Jae-young), and computer hacker Ha-yoon (Won Bin). These hitmen believe they're doing a vital job in society, just like any other profession. They run a private business where people from all walks of life come to them and place an order. After they meet their clients and discuss the time, place and method by which they want their targets to be eliminated, they sign a formal contract. They even have a discount rate for students. When the deal is done, they carry out their mission and finish it like a typical day at work. The four live and work together in mundane harmony, eating Ha-yoon's bad cooking and watching their crush (Go Eun-mi) read the news on TV. One day, a persistent high school girl (Gong Hyo-jin) shows up at their door and keeps trying to hire them, while Jung-woo falls for his target, a pregnant woman (Oh Seung-hyun). Then Sang-yeon gets approached for a big job he can't turn down, one far riskier than what they're used to. The client wants someone killed in the middle of a sold-out Hamlet play with high-profile businessmen, politicians and law officers in attendance. Meanwhile, the determined and intelligent prosecutor Jo (Jung Jin-young) is on to them, and mobilizes the police force to catch them in the act.

It is the oldest synagogue building still in use as a synagogue in Canada, and the oldest surviving synagogue on Vancouver Island. It can also boast of being the oldest synagogue building on the west coast of North America. Founded by 1859 when the cemetery is known to have been dedicated, in 1863 the congregation built the synagogue that is still in use. It is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The building is a National Historic Site of Canada, and has also been designated as a heritage property under the provincial Local Government Act. History Designed by John Wright, architect, the synagogue, located on Blanshard Street at Pandora Avenue beside a twentieth century community building, was built in 1863, during the Victoria building boom caused by the discovery of gold on the mainland nearby in 1858. The first Jews to settle on Vancouver Island came mostly from the United States during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The synagogue is said to have been the first building in town to have its cornerstone laid by the recently organized Victoria chapter of the Freemasons. A second cornerstone was laid on the same day by a member of the congregation's Building Committee. A time capsule was ceremoniously buried. It included not only the congregation's constitution, a list of donors tho the building fund, some coins, and a copy of the local newspaper, the British Colonist, still publishing today as the Victoria Times-Colonist, but the full membership lists of the Germania Sing Verein and French Benevolent Society of Victoria. The dedication was marked by a procession of benevolent societies of what appears to have been every religion and ethnicity resident in the young city. The marchers in the procession are known to have included not only the Hebrew Benevolent Society, but the French Benevolent Society, the St. Andrew's Society, the Germania Sing Verein (a German Singing Club), and the Fraternity of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons. The band from HMS Topaze, a 24-gun, Liffey class, Royal Navy frigate, played. The congregation's cemetery on Cedar Hill Road in Cedar Hill (Greater Victoria), dedicated in 1859. Architecture The building is in Romanesque Revival style. The facade of the two-story, brick building features a rose window and a corbelled gable. The ceiling of the interior is domed.

Life and career Pugh was born in the Tynte, Mountain Ash and grew up in Cilfynydd, near Pontypridd. He decided to become an actor after watching From Russia with Love at a cinema in Treforest with a cousin. A few years later he took night courses at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in North London, before being accepted at Rose Bruford College, where he graduated in 1976. He appeared as Harold Wilson in the 2005 Channel 4 drama Longford and as Hermann G√∂ring in the 2006 BBC drama-documentary Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. In 2007, he co-starred alongside Genevieve O'Reilly and Geraldine James in the ITV1 drama The Time of Your Life, in which he played a father whose 36-year-old daughter is recovering from an 18-year coma. In his early career, he frequently appeared in Welsh television and films, for example as Edgar Evans in the 1984 TV film Terra Nova, and as a soldier in Karl Francis's Milwr Bychan (1987). Even in more recent years, he has often portrayed Welsh characters, such as Owain Glyndwr in the 2012 BBC adaptation of Henry IV, Part I. In 2010, Pugh appeared as Tony in the two-part Doctor Who story comprising the episodes \\"The Hungry Earth\\" and \\"Cold Blood\\". He had a leading role in a 2008 episode of Torchwood, another BBC Wales production. In 2011 Pugh became Judge Patrick Coburn in Justice. The following year he joined HBO's Game of Thrones in the recurring role of Craster. In 2013 he portrayed Baron Rivers in The White Queen.

The film was given a restrictive NC-17 rating due to its sexual content. Fine Line opted not to pursue a less restrictive, more marketable R rating. Production The screenplay was written by Australian director John Duigan, producer Jan Sharp, and Carole Angier, a Rhys biographer. John Duigan later said he did not enjoy the experience of making this film: > It was probably the only really unsatisfying interaction that I've had with > a production company and I found that I had major disagreements with them > and with the producers.

Largely because it contained full frontal male nudity, as well as erotic content, it was classified as NC-17, which limited the number of theaters that would carry it. It received a largely favorable review by critic Vincent Canby of the New York Times.Vincent Canby, \\"Review/Film, Mrs. Rochester No.1, Long Before 'Jane Eyre'\\", New York Times, 16 April 1993; accessed 28 October 2018 He describes the lean Gothic romance film as \\"romantic\\" but \\"without soft edges.

Convergence criteria  A sequence of functions {fn} from S to M is pointwise Cauchy if, for each x ‚àà S, the sequence {fn(x)} is a Cauchy sequence in M. This is a weaker condition than being uniformly Cauchy. In general a sequence can be pointwise Cauchy and not pointwise convergent, or it can be uniformly Cauchy and not uniformly convergent. Nevertheless, if the metric space M is complete, then any pointwise Cauchy sequence converges pointwise to a function from S to M. Similarly, any uniformly Cauchy sequence will tend uniformly to such a function. The uniform Cauchy property is frequently used when the S is not just a set, but a topological space, and M is a complete metric space. The following theorem holds: * Let S be a topological space and M a complete metric space. Then any uniformly Cauchy sequence of continuous functions fn : S -> M tends uniformly to a unique continuous function f : S -> M.

Running between White City bus station and Camden Town, it is operated by Metroline. History Route 31 commenced operating on 7 September 1911 as a daily route between Chelsea and South Hampstead via Edith Grove, Earls Court Road, Kensington High Street, Notting Hill Gate, Great Western Road, Walterton Road and Belsize Road, replacing horse bus route 36, which also ran between Chelsea and Finchley Road. Three months later, on 7 December 1911, it was further extended to Finchley Road station. From 31 October 1912, it was re-routed at Belsize Road to run to Gospel Oak via Eton Avenue, Englands Lane and Parkhill Avenue instead of to FInchley Road. However, this extension did not last long and in December 1912 route 31 was curtailed to run daily from Chelsea to South Hampstead (Swiss Cottage). On 15 May 1916, route 31 was extended to run daily from Swiss Cottage to Tulse Hill via Adelaide Road, Camden Town, Eversholt Street, Russell Square, Southampton Row, Kingsway, Aldwych, Waterloo Bridge, Elephant & Castle, Camberwell Green, Denmark Hill and Herne Hill, replacing route 68, which was withdrawn on the same day. The operation of this long, horseshoe-shaped route between Chelsea and Tulse Hill lasted for one year; after 29 April 1917 route 31 was withdrawn between Camden Town and Tulse Hill, with route 68 being reintroduced to replace it. From 21 November 1987, the Sunday service was converted to one- person operation, and this was extended to daily operation from 15 April 1989, when was converted to minibus operation with AEC Routemasters replaced by 28-seat Alexander bodied Mercedes-Benz midibuses. In 1988, Gold Arrow routes 28 and 31 were introduced, operated by CentreWest. These vehicles were quickly found to be too small, and were replaced with Dennis Darts three years later. On 29 May 1999, the route was withdrawn between Notting Hill Gate and Chelsea and replaced by new route 328. Double-deck operation was reintroduced with low-floor Volvo B7TLs in 2004; there was no reduction in frequency. On 2 December 2006, the route was extended to Shepherd's Bush Green in preparation for the western extension of the congestion charge.

Synopsis Act I Two parents who are completely unprepared for parenthood bring home their newborn baby. The two cannot seem to name the baby. John thinks the baby is a boy, but Helen says the doctors said they could decide later. When the baby cries, the two cannot quite decide what to do. To their rescue comes Nanny ‚Äì who enters their apartment as if by magic, and is full of abrupt shifts of mood, first cooing at the baby soothingly, then screaming at it. In subsequent scenes, John and Nanny have an affair, Helen takes baby and leaves, only to come back a moment later rain-soaked and unhappy. Act II By the time the baby is a toddler, Daisy has finally been named. At this age Daisy has a penchant for running in front of buses and for lying, depressed, in piles of laundry. The audience hears an alarming essay Daisy has written in school, and the principal, the terrifying Miss Willoughby, is oblivious to the essay‚Äôs cry for help, and instead gleefully awards it an \\"A\\" for style. Years later, Daisy enters dressed as a girl, but obviously a young man. The audience follows his years of therapy, where he alternates between feelings of depression and anger, and is unable to complete his freshman essay on Gulliver‚Äôs Travels despite having been in college for five years. In a scene reminiscent of the beginning of the play, Daisy (who has since chosen a new name) and his young bride fondly regard their own baby, determined not to repeat their parents' calamitous mistakes. Response Critical reception \\"Mr. Durang is one of our theater‚Äôs brightest hopes ‚Äì he knows how to write funny plays, which makes him a rarity. In Baby with the Bathwater, he manages to combine all three modes farce, satire, good-humored wackiness ‚Ä¶ Durang keeps laughter bubbling... We laugh and gasp at the same time.\\" Sylviane Gold, The Wall Street Journal \\"Christopher Durang is one of the funniest dramatists alive, and one of the most sharply satiric. This time, parenthood is the target. Keith Reddin, as the former Daisy, is the perfect Durang leading man, puzzled and gravely polite, until he finally asserts himself.\\" Edith Oliver, The New Yorker \\"Nanny ‚Äì a warped Mary Poppins as played by Dana Ivey ‚Äì believes that cuddling children only spoils them. She gives the baby a rattle made of asbestos, lead and Red Dye No. 2. ‚Ä¶ Daisy proves a fuller creation than the outrageous facts suggest. Watching the character undergo therapy, we feel the pain that leads him to have more than 1,700 sexual partners, that makes it impossible for him to find an identity or a name.

Written and directed by Jung Ji-woo, the film is about a woman who has an affair while her husband is struggling to find employment. Plot Happy End is about Choi Bora (Jeon Do- yeon), a successful career woman who becomes involved with her ex-lover, Kim Il-beom (Joo Jin-mo). Bora's home life is a snore: she's mother to an infant child and her husband, Seo Min-ki (Choi Min-sik) has lost his job, leaving Bora as the family's sole breadwinner. It's unclear if Bora is with Il-beom just for the sex or for the passion, both of which Min-ki seems incapable of giving. But it seems the jobless Min-ki hasn't been just wandering around parks and reading romance novels as first thought; he knows something is going on, and he's collecting evidence. Min-ki has been emasculated by his inability to find a job and director Jung hammers this point home with a brief montage showing Min-ki grocery shopping, cooking, and doing the laundry. These are all very feminine jobs, particularly in very patriarchal South Korea. Most interesting is that Min-ki seems content to live with the cheating Bora, very much aware of his own shortcomings, which leaves him willing to be wronged. Bora is unable to stop going back to Il-beom even though she seems physically and emotionally damaged by their continued affair. Il-beom has realized that he is hooked on her, and is very aware of his jealously-driven actions toward her and her family. Without each other, they have no passion in their lives, and so they must keep going back to each other. Although Happy End ends rather unhappily, the film is not altogether downbeat. Director Jung Ji-woo has taken the role of observer, using mostly handheld cameras to capture the events in the lives of his 3 main subjects. The film is sexually explicit, and there is one scene of brutal violence.

He joined the Confederation for Democracy (CFD), an oppositional alliance against the military-sponsored government of General Suchinda Kraprayoon. He became a key figure of the network, alongside Palang Dharma Party leader Chamlong Srimuang, slum-dwellers' activist Prateep Ungsongtham, the daughter of incarcerated activist Chalard Worachat, trade unionist Somsak Kosaisuuk and the academics Sant Hathirat and Weng Tojirakarn.  Academic career  Prinya continued his studies in Germany, receiving his master's degree from the University of G√∂ttingen in 1998 and his Ph.D. from the same university in 2004. His dissertation thesis compared the systems and problematics of party financing, donations, transparency and control in Thailand and Germany. In 1998, he started teaching public law at the Thammasat University. In 2005, he became assistant rector for students' affairs. Since 2005, he has been vice rector for students' affairs. Since 2006, he has been a member of the jurisprudence branch of the National Research Council of Thailand. Proposals for constitutional reform Prinya has made several proposals for reform of the Constitution of Thailand. These include the eliminating of the requirement that candidates for the House of Representatives must be members of a political party for at least 90 days prior to an election. The requirement was originally designed to increase the affiliation that politicians have for political parties, thus increasing the strength of party-based politics.

The college currently has an annual student enrollment of more than 9,000 students. The Corsicana campus has strong ties with Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce which has branches at the Navarro College campuses in Corsicana and Midlothian.\\"Navarro Partnership\\" Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce  History  In spring 1946, a group of local citizens met to form a steering committee for the purpose of establishing a junior college in Navarro County. In a general election held July 16, 1946, voters approved the creation of Navarro Junior College and authorized a county tax to help finance the institution. In that same election, voters chose a seven- member board of trustees to govern the college. The first students began classes in September 1946. Most of the 238 members of that first student body were returning veterans from World War II taking advantage of assistance available under the newly enacted GI Bill of Rights. The first campus of Navarro College was the site of the Air Activities of Texas, a World War II primary flight school located six miles (10 km) south of Corsicana. In 1951, the campus was moved to its present location, a tract west of downtown Corsicana on Texas State Highway 31. In 1974, the college broadened its philosophy and purpose to encompass the comprehensive community-based educational concept, adding occupational education programs and implementing new education concepts including individualized and self-paced instruction and the use of audio-tutorial instructional media. In keeping with the new educational role, the word \\"junior\\" was dropped from the institution's name, and the official name Navarro College was adopted by the Board of Trustees. In an attempt to address the growing needs of its service area, which consists of Navarro, Ellis, Freestone, Limestone, and Leon counties, the college began offering courses in various locations in those areas in the early 1970s and eventually established two permanent centers, Navarro College South at Mexia and the Ellis County Center at Waxahachie. Later, a third and fourth off- campus centers were added in Midlothian and Fairfield.\\"Navarro College History\\" Navarro College Website 2014 Ebola controversy In October 2014, Navarro College received criticism for sending admission rejection letters to two prospective students from Nigeria because the college was \\"not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.\\" Nigeria was identified by the World Health Organization through the summer of 2014 with multiple confirmed cases of Ebola, but there had been no new Ebola cases (since early September). The rejected applicants lived in Ibadan, Nigeria, approximately 80 miles from Lagos, where the most recent infected cases were identified. The college offered an explanation on October 13, stating that the rejections were not a result of fears of Ebola, but that its international department had recently been restructured to focus on recruiting students from China and Indonesia. On October 16, college Vice-President Dewayne Gragg, issued a new statement, contradicting the previous explanation and confirming that there had indeed been a decision to \\"postpone our recruitment in those nations that the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. State Department have identified as at risk.\\"  Campus  The Corsicana campus has expanded to with 23 buildings. It is home to the Cook Education Center, which houses a dome planetarium with seating for more than two hundred, tied with the University of Texas at Arlington for the largest planetarium in Texas. The Cook Education Center also contains the Pearce Collections Museum, home to many American Civil War artifacts as well as a western art collection.

The episode was the culmination of a long-term movement by the Indian peoples (Hindu, Jain, Sikh, tribals, Parsi, Including representative of other minorities) Right to protect the cow, a traditional symbol of reverence in Hindu society. A meeting in late 1965 involving lobbying groups and influential Hindu religious orders initiated a year-long program of demonstrations and picketing, culminating in the planned march to the Parliament. Jan Sangh was a participant in the march. The march attracted hundreds of thousands of people, who were circling the Parliament building. In the chaos that ensued, demonstrators attacked by the police, who responded with rifle fire and mounted charges. The procession dispersed with the dead and wounded, thereafter to mobilize the people in other areas of Delhi, and protesting in front of government buildings. The police turned down the peaceful protestors with a death toll of eight (as per government records) and hundreds of people injured. The total population damage was estimated at about more than 500 protestors were dead and thousands were missing as well as heavily wounded, and the extent of violence to deal with protestors was equaled to that of riots. A law against unlawful assembly was imposed, by then PM Mrs. Indira Gandhi, along with a curfew, and the army was deployed for the first time since independence. About 1,500 demonstrators and prominent Hindu Nationalist politicians were arrested. The Home Minister Guljarilal Nanda was compelled to resign, but Prime Minister Indira Gandhi refused to concede to the demands of the protesters. Two weeks later, influential saints began their hunger strikes in protest; however, fissures in the front began to appear, and Gandhi chose to incorporate a Parliamentary Committee to analyze the feasibility of cow slaughter. The front was consistently outvoted, the nominees eventually resigned, the committee never produced a report, and the politicians successfully shifted the focus of national politics away from the issue. The episode had significant effects on the national polity for many years.  Background   Cow slaughter and religion  The scope, extent, and status of cow slaughter in ancient India has been a crime and taboo. Self- proclaimed disputed and preoccupied (less exposed to Indian history) writers of the concurrent time D. N. Jha, Romila Thapar, Juli Gittinger, et al. assert that cows were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times; the contemporary sacredness was a result of the influence of upper castes and accompanying Sanskritisation.Jha, Dwijendra Narayan. The Myth of the Holy Cow, was another game established by the autocratic and imperialist rulers, just like Fake Arya invasion theory. In spite of scholarly and social conscience available to believe the importance of Indian cows, they overlooked the correct translation to interpretate own meanings out of scared scriptures. Hindu scriptures are much advanced and scientific equal to the level of Sanskrit, which is alienated by the crooked British English, with the introduction of fake theories and stories. London/New York: Verso 2002 Marvin Harris notes the Vedic literature to be contradictory, with some stanzas suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption, while others suggesting a taboo on meat-eating; however, Hindu literature relating to cow veneration became extremely common in the first millennium A.D., and by about 1000 A.D., vegetarianism had become a well-accepted Hindu tenet.Marvin Harris (1990), India's sacred cow , Anthropology: contemporary perspectives, 6th edition, Editors: Phillip Whitten & David Hunter, Scott Foresman, , pages 201‚Äì204 The \\"protection of the cow\\" policy has commanded huge political significance in the subcontinent; the Mughal emperor Akbar had banned the killing of cows, and cow slaughter was treated as a capital offense in many Hindu- and Sikh-ruled states. 200 years of British English rule was well crafted to create a divide in the settled Indian society, with all sorts of religions and people living and thriving in India. Indian breed of Cows was a common point to respect among all of them. Almost all of the Muslim states and rulers were strictly against the slaughter of cows since their establishment in the Indian Subcontinent. With the 1857 uprising against East India Company's utter suppression and racist administration, undivided India was very cunning ruled by imperialist forces under Queen Victoria directly. They created tools and systems of division and suppressions, like the Indian Forest act and separate laws for Muslims and Hindus. Introduced another brutal Jameendaari system to draw money out of poor professionals and farmers. They introduced all their efforts that society breaks and does not remain united by any means.  Cow protection and national politics  The first organised cow protection movement was started by Kukas of Sikhism, a reformist group, during the British Raj in the late 1800s, which framed cows as a \\"sign of the moral quality of the state\\". Their ideas soon spread to Hindu reform movements, with Arya Samaj playing a tremendous role in converting this sentiment into a national movementFrom Plassey to Partition, a History of modern India, ≈öekhara BandyopƒÅdhyƒÅ·∫èa, p. 240, . and extensively lobbying for criminalizing cow slaughter. The first Gaurakshini sabha (cow protection society) was established in the Punjab Province in 1882.The Making of an Indian Metropolis, Colonial governance and public culture in Bombay, 1890/1920, Prashant Kidambi, p. 176, . The movement often manifested as brazen Anti-Muslim riots claiming thousands of lives across the country, especially on the occasions of Islamic festivals of sacrifices. The Cow riots of 1893 were the most intense civil disturbance on the Indian subcontinent since the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Post-independence, the insertion of a clause about protection of cows into the Directive Principles and large-scale migration of Muslim populations into Pakistan led to a large reduction in riots. However, with the accumulation of political power in the hands of conservative Savarna elites, the Hindu Mahasabha and other allied organisations saw even more opportunity to actively solicit a total ban on cow slaughter. The overtly secular stances of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru (who threatened to resign if such a bill were passed) foiled the efforts. Tensions began to re-emerge in the 1960s, when a new generation of Muslims born after independence and who were less aware of the trauma of religious violence in India of the 1940s, reached adolescence and began to assert their rights, whilst Nehru began to lose his firm grip over the Indian sociopolitical scenario.  All Party Campaign  After Nehru's death in 1964, a lobbying group set up by business magnate Seth Dalmia, Murli Chandra Sharma of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, M. S. Golwalkar of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for the purpose of cow protection, began to actively engage in open political campaigns. The topic soon penetrated into popular sociopolitical discourse, and the group gradually added Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha, Akhil Bharatiya Ram Rajya Parishad, Vishva Hindu Parishad, and other Hindu parties. All stakeholders were subsequently invited to a meeting at Delhi in late 1965, which saw three of the four principal Shaivite shankaracharyas, dozens of mahants, and other ascetics from different religious orders promise to play integral roles in a nationwide campaign to mobilize the masses. Swami Karpatri was chosen as the leader, and he advocated for a program of demonstrations and picketing, leading up to a march on Parliament in November 1966, which was approved. The Shankaracharya of Puri also decided to undertake a fast until death unless cow slaughter was across the country; other ascetics supported his proposed agenda and some offered to court arrest, shall the need arise. Picketing started outside the residence of Home Minister Gulzarilal Nanda in August 1966; as a patron of the Bharat Sadhu Samaj, he was widely seen as a figure sympathetic to their cause. In October 1966, a procession in Washim, Maharashtra, demanding a nationwide ban on cow slaughter led to a riotous situation; police fired on the rioters, killing 11 people. There was a discussion about the issue in the Union Cabinet, which refused to concede to popular sentiments; however Home Minister Gulzarilal Nanda recommended that states might choose to introduce a ban at their discretion. This episode served as an immediate trigger for more demonstrations. On 6 November, preparations were highly visible, with posters plastered across the city and high-profile business houses sponsoring the meals of the marchers. A total bandh of all shops in Delhi was planned; Bhartiya Jan Sangh had joined in the rally at the last moment, and the front was now named Sarvadaliya Gorasksha Maha-Abiyan Samiti (SGMS; 'Committee for the Great All-Party Campaign for the Protection of the Cow').  Riot  On the morning of 7 November, a few hundred thousand people, predominantly from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Hindu Mahasabha, and Arya Samaj, had assembled from far-off places at an open space near the Parliamentary Complex. A vast majority of them were ash-smeared, trident-wielding, mostly-naked Sadhus. Christophe Jaffrelot noted it as the most popular mass movement since independence. Proceedings started around noon, and the environment was reportedly 'relaxed, almost festive' per a report by The New York Times, with the virtues of cows being extolled; the first speaker was Karpatri. Soon afterwards, Swami Rameshwaranand, a Lok Sabha legislator of Jan Sangh, from Karnal, Punjab who had earlier been expelled from the house for 10 days for a continual failure to abide by parliamentary decorum whilst urging for a ban on cow slaughter, rose to the podium. He leveraged his expulsion, asking the mob \\"to teach a lesson\\" by forcing the Parliament to close down, while other hard- line leaders served as accompanying provocateurs. Jana Sangh leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee appealed to the Swami to withdraw his call and urged the demonstrators to maintain peace, but was not heeded. Thus invited, the mob went on a rampage, crying \\"Swami Rameshwaranand ki jai\\", and breached the barricades; the police responded with tear gas and cane clubs, but their resistance proved futile. As waves of demonstrators armed with tridents attacked the police and pelted them with stones, a policeman was stoned to death. Police were slow to respond, but at around 1:30 pm, they engaged in rifle fire and mounted a charge with lead-tipped clubs. While the charge was successful in dispersing the immediate mob, it caused fatal injuries, and having failed to succeed in breaching the Parliament gates, the mob merely scattered to attack other less-protected areas of Delhi. Houses of prominent legislators from the ruling party (Indian National Congress), including that of K. Kamaraj, were broken into. Passengers were forced out of vehicles before being set on fire, high-profile government buildings were ransacked, and random arson was indulged in. The riot ended at around 4:30 pm with a death toll of eight and hundreds injured. The total damage was estimated at about 1 billion rupees by city officials; numerous vehicles were destroyed, along with numerous shops. A curfew was imposed for 48 hours but withdrawn the next morning; the army was deployed for the first time, and a law concerning unlawful assembly was imposed for an indefinite time span. About 1,500 demonstrators, including over 500 ascetics and prominent leaders of Hindu Nationalist parties and SGMS, were arrested. The Lieutenant Governor described the rioting as highly organised; intelligence agencies had failed to predict the situation. The extent of the violence was the most significant since the partition riots, and M. N. Srinivas commented that the episode solidly convinced him that the Hindus of North India had not evolved into modern people. A few days later, Balraj Madhok, Rameshwaranand, and other prominent functionaries of RSS and Jan Sangh were arrested on charges of stoking the riots. Vajpayee condemned the riots and blamed undesirable elements for the violence, saying that it had harmed a pious cause. There was widespread discontent against Nanda, who was believed to be sympathetic to the rioters, forcing him to resign; Prime Minister Indira Gandhi acquitted him of all blame before the Parliament and temporarily held the portfolio herself before choosing Yashwantrao Chavan as a replacement.  Aftermath  Beginning on 17 November, Sadhus started courting arrest, as planned. On the 20th, Prabhudutt Brahmachari and the Shankaracharya of Puri began hunger strikes; others soon followed. Gandhi took a hardliner stance, refusing to 'cow down to the cow savers' and detained the fasting sadhus to shift them out of public view; however, the fasting continued along with popular mobilization by cow- slaughter activists. Whilst her stance was commended across liberal media and supported by the Communist Party and others, failing health of the Shankaracharya and the death of two less-prominent fasters followed. Soon, fissures started appearing within SGMS. A religious faction led by Karpatri split away around December 1966 to fight elections around the locus of cow protection, to the discontent of Gowalkar. Within a couple of weeks, the fourth Shankaracharya and other Vaishnava religious orders subsequently criticized the front for placing Shankaracharya's health in jeopardy. On 24 January, a seriously ailing Shankaracharya criticized the BJS for pandering to electoral politics and failing to protect either Hinduism or the cow. Gandhi used this time to set up a joint parliamentary committee composed of animal husbandry experts and politicians across the divides (including from the SGMS); their agenda was to examine the 'feasibility' of a 'total ban on the slaughter of the cow and its progeny' and deliver a recommendation within a time frame of six months. The committee was to be chaired by Retd. Justice Amal Kumar Sarkar (along with two Congress chief ministers, two Congress Ministers of State, four central bureaucrats, and three nominees of SGMS‚Äîthe Shankaracharya of Puri, Golwalkar, and R. P. Mookerji, elder brother of Syama Prasad Mukherjee), and the offer was accepted by all parties, with minimal negotiations. In the meantime, Gandhi once again recommended on 5 January 1967 that states enact their own bans on cow slaughter. Shankaracharya broke his fast; it had lasted 73 days and was longer than any other hunger strike in recorded Indian history. Jan Sangh failed to leverage the cow-protection episode in any major manner from an electoral sense; their seats increased from 14 to just 35 in the 1967 Lok Sabha elections and Congress lost many seats, with the popular vote share dropping by about 4%; Jan Sangh had managed, however, to successfully challenge the Congress hegemony in urban Hindu areas, especially the cow belt. The committee started its work after the elections. Shrewd planning by Gandhi had filled the committee with trusted secularists, federalists and people with an economic interest in the beef trade. The two factions often collided with a near-complete lack of any common ground before the three members from SGMS eventually resigned in July 1968, outfoxed and outmaneuvered. Whilst the committee continued, the issue rapidly lost momentum in national politics. The committee was finally dissolved in 1979, having never submitted a report.  Legacy  Overall, the agitation propelled the Hindu Right into the foreground of national politics for the first time; simultaneously, Gandhi's successful negotiation helped establish her image as a resolute leader who later had the tenacity to lead a weakened Congress after the 1969 split. The episode also played a significant role in Gandhi's choosing to shift away from the staunch secular ideals displayed by her father, embracing the Hindu way of life and enabling communal politics. Congress (R) went on to choose the cow-and-calf symbol during the 1971 Lok Sabha elections. On the other hand, after years of failure to exploit the issue of cow protection to reap electoral gains and a failure to mobilize the lower castes to their cause, the Hindu Right chose to shift their primary focus from cow protection to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. RSS and VHP commemorate the event every year.

Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 6¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. First observed as at Simeiz Observatory in 1914, Liliths observation arc begins 7 years after its official discovery observation, with its first used observation made at Konkoly Observatory in 1934.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discoverer for French composer Marie-Juliette Olga Lili Boulanger (1893‚Äì1918), younger sister of the noted conductor and composer, Nadia Boulanger. Her byname \\"Lili\\" originates from Lilith, Adam's first wife in Jewish mythology ().  Physical characteristics  Lilith is an X-type asteroid in the Bus‚ÄìBinzel SMASS taxonomy. It has also been classified as a P-type asteroid by NASA's space- based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).  Rotation period  In February 2014, a rotational lightcurve of Lilith was obtained by Italian astronomer Andrea Ferrero at the Bigmuskie Observatory in Mombercelli, Italy. The photometric observations rendered a period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.11 in magnitude ().  Diameter and albedo  According to NASA's WISE telescope with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Lilith measures () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.10, and calculates a diameter of 24.2 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.2. The WISE team also published an alternative mean-diameter () and an albedo of ().

It marks Rowan Atkinson's d√©but as the character Edmund Blackadder, and is the first appearance of the recurring characters Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and Percy (Tim McInnerny). The comedy actor Peter Cook guest stars as King Richard III. The Black Adder is a historical comedy set in late Medieval England on the cusp of the Tudor Period, and centres on the eponymous \\"Black Adder\\", the pseudonym adopted from this episode onwards by Edmund Plantagenet, Duke of Edinburgh. The premise is that Henry Tudor did not become king in 1485, but instead rewrote history to portray himself as the man who killed Richard III. The show sets out to rectify the situation by telling the \\"real story\\" and presents the alternative history of King Richard IV. The script of this episode contains many lines and situations which borrow from or parody William Shakespeare's plays Richard III and Macbeth.  Plot  Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, used as a filming location for King Richard's castle A prologue introduces the episode with a narrative describing the Tudor King Henry VII as one of history's greatest liars and establishes the show's premise that he rewrote history to suit his own ends.Marshall, p.120 The narrator dispels the popular depiction of King Richard III of England as a scheming murderer; he appears as a villainous hunchback, hobbling towards his young nephews with a dagger, but the dagger is revealed to be a toy and the hunchback is a sack of presents. A close-up of one of the children fades to a shot of the bearded Richard, Duke of York (Brian Blessed) roaring with laughter, as the narrator declares that he grew up to be \\"a big, strong boy\\", and that it was he who was crowned king after winning the Battle of Bosworth Field, not Henry. The story opens in England in the year 1485 on the eve of the Battle of Bosworth. A feast is held at the castle of King Richard III of England as his court prepares for the next day's battle with the forces led by Henry Tudor. The King (Peter Cook) gives a speech parodying the opening of Shakespeare's play. A young lord's overzealous cheering raises the King's attention, who asks Richard, Duke of York, about the cheerer's identity. Richard doesn't recognise him but his eldest son, Harry, informs him that it is his second son, Edmund ‚Äì though Richard mishears the name as \\"Edna\\", starting a running gag lasting throughout the series. He asks Edmund if he will be participating in the battle; Edmund's buffoonish answer makes the King uneasy, but Richard promises that he will place Edmund far away from the King. Edmund and his friend, Lord Percy Percy, Duke of Northumberland, are joined by a servant Baldrick, who with a bit of flattery manages to win enough favour with Edmund to be chosen as his squire for the morning battle. The next day, both Edmund and Baldrick oversleep. Once woken by Edmund's mother, Gertrude of Flanders, they rush to the battlefield, Edmund by horse and Baldrick by mule. Edmund is initially eager to fight but, observing the combatants from afar, he comes to the realisation that fighting could lead to death. He decides at that moment to remain a spectator and then hides behind a bush to relieve himself. Meanwhile, the King has won the battle but lost his horse. Telling the Duke of York that he will meet him back at the castle, he wanders off to search for another horse, stumbling across Edmund's steed. Noticing an attempt to steal his horse, Edmund draws his sword and decapitates the apparent thief, only recognising him as King Richard III afterwards. With Baldrick's help, Edmund hides the body in a cottage but forgets the head, which Percy brings, claiming it to be his triumph until realising whose head it is. Before they can escape, a wounded knight begs to be sheltered in exchange for his land and money, but Edmund and Baldrick shake him off. Returning to the castle, Edmund reveals that King Richard is dead, startling his mother and also his father, who has freshly returned from battle. Any doubts are dispelled by Harry, who brings the King's corpse back to the castle. Edmund fears retribution for his crime but as everyone assumes Henry Tudor to be the murderer, Edmund gets away, while his father is hailed as the new king, Richard IV. Edmund, now a royal prince, resolves to become more assertive, hoping to gain his father's respect and approval, and gives himself the title \\"The Black Adder\\" (at Baldrick's suggestion who dissuaded him from his first idea, \\"The Black Vegetable\\"). To his dismay, Edmund finds out that Percy brought the wounded knight from the cottage back to the castle, but after hearing of his wealth, Edmund lets him stay without asking any further questions. Later, Edmund finds himself haunted by the headless ghost of his great-uncle, who openly accuses him of beheading him and even calling him \\"Edna\\" in order to taunt him. During the celebratory banquet in honour of the new king, a portrait of Henry Tudor is presented for ridicule, and Edmund is horrified to learn that the wounded man he is sheltering is actually the enemy. Edmund rushes back to his room only to find Henry Tudor gone. Edmund pursues him but the ghost of Richard III chases Edmund into a foggy meadow, where he meets three witches who address the Black Adder as \\"Ruler of men, Ravisher of women, Slayer of kings\\" and predict that he shall one day become king. Edmund thus proclaims \\"History, here I come!\\" When he leaves the meadow, the witches remark among themselves that they had expected Henry Tudor to look different, before realising that they had prophesied to the wrong person.  Cast  \\"The Foretelling\\" marks Rowan Atkinson's 1983 debut in his role as the Edmund Blackadder characters The closing credits of this episode list the cast members \\"in order of precedence\\".Roberts, p.420 : Important characters are in bold. *Peter Cook as Richard III *Brian Blessed as Richard IV *Peter Benson as Henry VII *Robert East as Harry, Prince of Wales *Rowan Atkinson as Edmund, Duke of Edinburgh *Tim McInnerny as Percy, Duke of Northumberland *Elspet Gray as The Queen *Philip Kendall as the Painter *Kathleen St John as Goneril *Barbara Miller as Regan *Gretchen Franklin as Cordelia *Tony Robinson as Baldrick Production \\"The Foretelling\\" featured a guest star appearance by veteran comedian Peter Cook as Richard III. Cook had previously worked with Rowan Atkinson, having appeared together in The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979) and Peter Cook & Co (1980). Cook's appearance in this episode as Richard III caused him some alarm; both producer John Lloyd and co-star Brian Blessed have recalled that Cook was very nervous about playing the part. Cook was also not fond of adhering to a script and his lines contained many improvisations.Roberts, p.114 In the end, parts of Cook's performance took the form of a mock-heroic parody of Laurence Olivier's portrayal of the king in the 1955 film version of Shakespeare's play.Marshall, p.118 References to Shakespeare This first episode of The Black Adder contains many references to the works of Shakespeare and, as with subsequent episodes in this series, the end credits include an acknowledgement of \\"additional dialogue by William Shakespeare\\". Most obviously, the script of \\"The Foretelling\\" draws on material from Richard III but a number of other aspects of the episode also parody Shakespeare's other works: *The prologue introduces King Richard III at first as a deformed Shakespearean villain before revealing him to be a kindly and avuncular man who teases his young nephews with a pretend hump, humorously demolishing traditional portrayals of the character. The villainous role is instead taken on by Prince Edmund. Richard's queen consort and Edmund's mother is Gertrude of Flanders; in Hamlet, the protagonist's mother is Gertrude, Queen of Denmark. *In the opening banquet scene, King Richard gives a speech which is a pastiche of Richard's opening soliloquy, \\"Now is the winter of our discontent ...\\" (Richard III, Act I, Scene I). *Before the Battle of Bosworth, King Richard rouses his troops with a speech, \\"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more...\\" ‚Äì words taken directly from King Henry V's speech at the Siege of Harfleur (Henry V, Act 3, Scene I). *After the battle, Peter Cook's King Richard is heard cheerfully calling \\"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!\\" (Richard III, Act V, Scene IV) in a bathetic style, as if he is whistling for a pet dog. *Upon discovering the decapitated body of King Richard, Prince Harry makes a sorrowful, mock-heroic speech which comprises one of Mark Antony's lines from Julius Caesar, \\"O! pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\\" (Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene I), and Horatio's line from Hamlet, \\"And flights of angels sing thee to their rest\\" (Hamlet, Act 5, Scene 2). *The appearance of Richard III's ghost to haunt Prince Edmund during the victory banquet is based closely on the haunting of Macbeth by Banquo's ghost (Macbeth, Act III Scene IV). *In the final scene, Prince Edmund confronts three witches who foretell that he will become king, in a parody of the Three Witches from Macbeth (Macbeth, Act III Scene IV). In the episode credits, the Black Adder witches are given the names of Goneril, Regan and Cordelia, the names of King Lear's three daughters.

He wrote two columns about the controversy. Resignation from HLI In August 2010, Euteneuer resigned from HLI at the request of his bishop. On January 31, 2011, Euteneuer issued a statement disclosing that he had \\"violat[ed] the boundaries of chastity with an adult female who was under my spiritual care,\\" and expressing regret. Euteneuer emphasized that the violation had nothing to do with his position in Human Life International but \\"were related exclusively to my own decisions and conduct within the ministry of exorcism that I carried out independently from my responsibilities at HLI.\\" In June 2012, the Associated Press reported that a woman had filed a lawsuit against the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington (Virginia), that diocese's bishop, and HLI accusing Euteneuer of sexual abuse during the performance of an exorcism. He was never a priest of the Diocese of Arlington. He was not named in the lawsuit since he and the woman had already reached a financial settlement. In 2014, a judge dismissed three of four of the suit's claims of legal wrongdoing against HLI.

The story re-unites three former childhood friends for their friend's funeral, which prompts two vowing to find his murderer. Plot Ex-gangster Wang-jae (Ahn Gil-kang) chases a gang of punks into an alley where he's fatally stabbed. His four childhood friends reunite, first time in nearly twenty years, at Wang-jae's funeral. Up to then, each has gone their own way: Tae-su (Jung Doo-hong) became a Seoul police detective. Pil-ho's (Lee Beom-soo) taken over his brother-in-law Wang-jae's throne as a mobster. Seok-hwan (City of Violence director Ryoo Seung-wan) who works as a debt collector while his older brother Dong-hwan struggles as a math teacher. A flashback reveals a pact they made on School Picnic Day before they fought with other youths. After the funeral, Tae-su decides to investigate the murder within a week before he would return to his job in Seoul. Meanwhile, Seok-hwan decides to find and kill Wang-jae's murderers. While investigating, Tae-su is attacked by youth gangs, who use an array of weapons including baseball bats, hip hop, bikes, hockey sticks, and yo-yo's. Tae-su barely escapes with his life after Seok-hwan's unexpected arrival. They decide to work together. After hunting the gangs, they discover Wang-jae's death isn't a random mindless attack. It was a planned murder. The revelation leads them to Seok-hwan's own brother, who confesses a secret. It's Pil-ho who was behind the plan, which was hatched after Wang-jae disapproved Pil-ho's plans to turn their city into a tourist district. After strangers tried to kill him as part of tying up Pil-ho's loose ends, Wang-jae's young murderer agrees to testify against Pil-ho. A killer douses the young murderer in gasoline and sets him on fire. When Tae-su realizes there's no legal way to take Pil-ho down, he confronts Pil-ho, but he ends up badly beaten. Meanwhile, Seok-hwan, Dong-hwan and their mother are on their way to a restaurant when a truck smashes into their car. After Dong-hwan and his mother's funeral, Seok- hwan and Wang-jae's widow leave the funeral house and sees Tae-su waiting outside. Tae-su persuades Wang-jae's widow into revealing information on her brother Pil-ho's whereabouts. No longer bound by law, Tae-su and Seok-hwan storm Pil-ho's fortress where they fight their way through swarms of armed cooks and bodyguards until the banquet room. They witness Pil-ho killing a Seoul president, which prompts all guests to leave just Tae-su, Seok-hwan, Pil-ho and his four elite guards alone in the room. The elite guards immediately take Tae-su and Seok-hwan on. Two men, victorious but exhausted, set to take on Pil-ho, but Pil-ho takes them by surprise by attacking Seok- hwan, who loses his fingers. Pil-ho turns and stabs Tae-su's stomach, ignoring Seok-hwan who's binding the katana to his hand with torn table cloth. Tae-su informs Pil-ho that the last man who stands last wins. Before Pil-ho could react, Seok-hwan stabs him through the chest, killing him. As Tae-su bleeds to death, he recalls the day he and his childhood friends walk home from the School Picnic, talking about future. Seok-hwan says they didn't win, but his older brother Dong-hwan says they did. Seok-hwan insists they have nothing to show for it. Wang-jae disagrees, pointing out they have the snake tonic. They will drink it in twenty years' time when they become rich men. One wonder what would happen if it didn't work out. \\"Doesn't matter,\\" Wang-jae says. \\"We won't amount to much, anyway!\\" Back at Pil-ho's place, the exhausted Seok-hwan glances around, noting the carnage he and his late friend Tae-su had created, and sighs heavily. Finally he says, \\"Fuck it.\\" Cast *Ryoo Seung-wan ... Yoo Suk-hwan *Jung Doo-hong ... Jung Tae-soo *Lee Beom-soo ... Jang Pil-ho *Jung Suk-yong ... Yoo Dong-hwan *Lee Joo-shil ...
